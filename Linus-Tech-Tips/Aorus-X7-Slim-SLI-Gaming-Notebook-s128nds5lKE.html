more welcome to my unboxing of something
a little bit on the different side well
I'm not really unboxing it it's here in
the boxes here they've already been
undefined but anyway this is the a Oris
x7 which is one of the most interesting
gaming notebooks that i've ever had the
pleasure of checking out so let's start
with the general specs it's got a
Haswell 4th gen core i7 4708 q that's a
quad core that's clocked at 2.4
gigahertz nominal and up to 3.4
gigahertz with a single core running at
maximum boost it has 16 gigs of ram and
is configurable with up to 32 gigs of
ram so it has four slots it has dual GTX
765 M 2 gig graphics cards and a 17
point 3 inch LCD display so that's 1080p
it's 8 millisecond response time LED
backlit all that good stuff for storage
it has 2 128 gig m SATA SSDs running in
raid 0 and a 1 terabyte 5400 RPM drive
so that is a 2 and a half inch standard
drive so it's up to three storage
devices it uses wireless 802.11 AC and
it has killer branded gigabits onboard
LAN there we go so that has their
prioritization engine and all that good
stuff and then finally it has a 70 3.26
watt hour lithium polymer battery
fascinating Linus you might say that's
an awful lot of specs but they're not
that amazing well they are a little bit
amazing when you consider that they are
crammed into a 22 point 9 millimeter
thick chassis so that's only marginally
thicker than the p30 4G that I liked so
much it's actually quite similar to the
GS 70 from MSI it's 2.9 kilograms making
it lighter than your standard gaming
notebook but not super light due to the
sheer size of it and the all aluminum
construction it's got some
well I guess we'll do like a bit of a
port tour here so on the left hand side
it's got the aforementioned Gigabit
Ethernet HDMI a first HDMI port VGA one
USB 3.0 port and headphone and
microphone ports you've also got a
speaker grille here on the left-hand
side on the front you've got a whole lot
of nothing then on the right hand side
you find another speaker grille an SD
card reader two more USB 3.0 ports for a
total of three another HDMI out and
DisplayPort out so that's kind of cool
moving around to the back we catch a
glimpse of one ventilation hole we've
got another ventilation hole two more
USB 2.0 ports power in and that pretty
much rounds it out on the top and the
bottom you will as normal on a notebook
not find a whole lot of i/o now the
speaker's there using our our wrists I
don't even know how to pronounce it
ARS plus branding so there are 2 2 watt
speakers in the front and then there are
actually two woofers on the bottom it in
practice sounds much better than most
notebooks but of course here are these
speaker ports on the bottom they're not
going to blow your socks off or
eliminate the need for a proper desktop
speaker system by any stretch of the
imagination and in fact there's one
thing that I would have liked to see
changed in the audio implementation and
that's maybe put the speakers up here
instead so that there's somewhat pointed
at my ears I found that if I had my head
like on the same plane as the bottom of
the notebook that was where the best
listening experience could be had the
touchpad is a little bit unique so we
can make our way to the inside here and
that is that it is a glass touchpad it
is completely smooth which actually
would have bothered me not that long ago
I'm I'm used to it now because of
smartphones and I think I'd still prefer
a frosted glass touchpad but it tracks
well and that's the most important thing
and it doesn't actually bother me it's a
bit of a fingerprint magnet but not as
bad as I necessarily would have thought
the keyboard is automatically backlit
although you can manually override it
with function space so you can have off
fifty percent or a hundred percent and
it is a chiclet keyboard which is not
necessarily my favorite but as far as
chiclet keyboards go it's about as good
as it gets there is absolutely no flex
the entire keyboard area at all again
due to the metal construction of the
notebook so in spite of its size really
really impressed there it's also got
some other cool features so your full
complement of keys including properly
laid out arrow keys a full number pad
all the function hotkeys that you could
possibly want and finally da-da-da-dah
programmable macro keys so there's a
color-coded G up at the top here and you
can use the included utility to program
any number of different functionalities
to each of the five keys and then you
have five different profiles for all of
the five keys combined for a total of
twenty-five functions not least - but
definitely last it's the fact that the
keyboard also supports anti-ghosting so
you're not gonna have any accidental
random triggering of random Keys even in
a gaming scenario oh actually no the
true last thing is that it does have a
Windows key lock but that's actually
done in software as opposed to being
done in hardware which is a little bit
of an unusual thing for me to see now of
course you go okay well it's super slim
it's an SLI gaming notebook but come on
- what are the temperatures like
honestly I am incredibly impressed at
idle we weren't able to measure
temperatures that were above you know
like normal skin temperature the thing
barely felt warm to the touch only
around 22 degrees max and it was
actually quite quiet I mean there my mic
is here the exhaust fans right here it's
very very quiet at idle under load
yeah the fans do start to ramp up a
little bit you can actually control them
manually you can set it up to go okay
well no I want 40% fan speed max and
there's a couple of different things you
can do the software but under load it
did get a little bit louder but what it
didn't get was much warmer even though
this room is only about 18 degrees so it
is a little bit on the cold side it is
still very impressive to see a dual
graphics card gaming notebook deliver
temperatures under 27 degrees even
directly above where the GPU heat pipes
are not is partly due well probably
entirely due to their unique cooling
setup on this thing so there are two
fans here and here at the back you can
actually see the intake
here and then rather than having
restrictive exhausts like you would find
on most notebooks there are two full
sets of exhausts for each of the fans
and you can feel the heat really coming
out of them the fans are very
effectively cooling it to the point
where it doesn't get noticeably warm and
this was the hottest spot I could find
up here on the keyboard itself to work
especially towards the bottom it's just
barely warm to the touch so that's
really really impressive and probably
probably the coolest thing about this
notebook so to speak all right so who's
the competition for a product like this
I'm gonna fire up Crysis actually maybe
I'll give you guys some idea of what it
sounds like under load here so go ahead
and there you go can it run Crysis yes
absolutely that is maxed out crisis at
1080p running at about 75 frames per
second in a fairly non-demanding
environment but don't worry that'll give
you a very playable experience and that
is of course those speakers that are
quite loud there you go anyway
so who's the competition for a gaming
notebook like this the obvious ones are
gonna be the razor blade Pro and the msi
gs70 now the blade pro has an offset
touchpad that drove me absolutely crazy
and regardless how how awesome the
display on it might be that is a
deal-breaker for me the GS 70 is a much
more interesting option to me personally
and it's actually quite comparable to
this one it offers similar storage
options
you were memory slots however only two
memory slots but it is in a slightly
slimmer form factor the big difference
between the ARS and the GS 70 is on the
GPU side this guy contains two gtx 765
to gig graphics cards whereas the GS 70
contains only one so i would go as far
as to say based on the idea of this
overall that is to say the industrial
design and the performance I haven't
seen pricing yet though so guys you can
check out the link and once this thing
is actually available somewhere that'll
be live I would say if you're looking
for the ultimate thin and relatively
light gaming or workstation notebook for
maximum bragging rights this actually
might just be it thank you for checking
out this unboxing and overview of the
ARS x7 like the video if you liked it
dislike
if you disliked it leave a comment and
let us know how you feel about thin and
light gaming notebooks versus regular
gaming notebooks which tend to be very
brick like in their overall form factor
in fact I have one here that I can just
grab and hold up for comparison I mean
here's some more a more classic gaming
notebook side by side with the ARS x7 do
you would you consider a gaming notebook
if they were all slim like this we'd
love to know your thoughts and as all
these guys don't forget to subscribe to
