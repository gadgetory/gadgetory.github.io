actives this is the alpha cool env XP
and Vidya GTX 670 stainless steel
polished water block from alpha cool
pretty much this is what we're planning
to use on our on our BitFenix liquid
cooled machine so we're gonna use a GTX
670 and this alpha cool block in order
to achieve the cooling performance that
we need in a small form-factor liquid
cooled machine the thing about the 670
is it's such a low profile video card
that it is perfect for a low profile
liquid cooling installation so you might
have noticed that compared to my
standard HTC 8x phone size comparison
that I've never done before now or maybe
once before now that this is not a huge
water block and the reason for that is
the 670 appears to be a large graphics
card at first but when you turn it
around it actually has like an extension
that's only made of plastic I'll get
slick to come in and have a look at this
for us an extension that's only made of
plastic that goes beyond the size of the
PCB here so this block is a perfectly
appropriate size for this particular
card that makes sense to you so why did
we decide to go with this one well veil
ability helps and alpha cool has been
around a long time making water cooling
gear so let's just go ahead and see if I
can figure out how to like why did you
do this look at this it comes in like a
food package see it's like it's like
vacuum sealed it's just I said oh okay
yeah it's all good I mean I think I can
think of one reason it's gonna prevent
the copper from oxidizing if they have
it sealed up like this because one of
the things that drives me crazy about
copper blocks is oxidized ugly stained
copper so I'm going to be extremely
careful not to oh that's going to be
hard yep I have a solution do gloves I
love the look of copper I hate the look
of stained oak sized ugly car
so we're gonna go ahead and put on some
gloves to handle this I would highly
recommend that you do the same thing
it's not because of any sort of fault in
fact the more pure the copper being used
by the manufacturer the better the
chance that it will be easily stained
and look horrific
after a little while so the top is a
polished stainless steel although it's
available in a variety of finishes so
you can see how reflective that is we're
gonna see if we can catch slick in the
reflection bezel am i close I got him
there we go that is how reflective the
top of this block is it's actually only
a very very slim layer of stainless
steel covering the top of the block and
it's two separate pieces of copper here
that make up the overall construction so
you can also see they're using allen key
screws to hold the whole thing together
very very securely I mean these are
pressure tested so yeah now this is a
bit of a unique thing so they're
actually using a little bit less
material to make up the block itself
here it used to be that you'd see the
threads themselves made out of whatever
material the block is in this case
copper but what they've done is they've
actually expanded the area here by
putting like a threaded piece through it
so that's sort of a unique approach it
looks like it allows them to save on
some of the costs of the block but it
shouldn't affect performance and it
shouldn't affect the ability of the
block to to accept larger threaded
fittings so that was that was a big
problem for a while as some fittings
like the older DTEC Barb's had threads
that were like this long and people were
putting them through full cover blocks
and they were going almost all the way
through to where the other fitting would
go on the other side and they were
leaking because they weren't going in
all the way so that's that's not going
to be a problem with this one thing to
be careful of with these water blocks is
you want to make sure that you have a
reference card so here they're giving
you a little guidance thing for making
sure that your card is actually
compatible with the block before you get
started so you can see right here all
the places where you need to apply
thermal pads so here for memory and
memory here for the GPU itself and here
for the VRM
and let's see what else we got here ah
yes
their whole copper themed thing that I
think is freakin awesome so here's some
more thermal compound that's gonna be
for the GPU core itself you don't use a
thermal pad for that and then copper
stoppers I would probably go ahead and
use nickel plated stoppers just because
that'll be more consistent with the
overall look that I'm going for in my
build but I think that pretty much
covers it don't forget to subscribe to
