the latest version of afterburner and I
just want to oh okay that won't work
well with the GTX 590 the the latest
beta version of afterburner I was able
to get my hands on does support over
volting and I wanted to test my
hypothesis that the under clocked gf1
tens on here the under clocked under
voltage EF 110 s would be able to clock
up nearer to their single card brethren
like the GTX 580 if they were over
volted or even Volta or even set to the
same voltage as the GTX 580 so while I
was not able to get to the same
performance level at the same voltage
with more voltage so I actually maxed
out the slider and after burn I'll show
you guys the settings afterwards I was
able to achieve better than stop clocks
of a GTX 580 on the GTX 590 when you
consider how much lower clocked it comes
by default I was able to get over 800
megahertz on the core which is about a
30 percent overclock which is
outstanding and then on the memory I was
able to get up over 2.1 gigahertz so
that is about 22 percent on the memory
so that's going to turn into some
serious performance improvement so what
I'm going to do is or what I'm doing
here is I'm gonna be running a 3d mark
11 before and after to give you guys a
rough ballpark of how much extra
performance were able to get out of the
GTX 590 by overclocking it as such now I
won't make any claims about how long
your card is going to last and do bear
in mind guys that yeah sorry my light
hasn't been pointed in the right
direction here do bear in mind guys that
depending on the manufacturer of your
GTX 590 you may not necessarily have any
warranty left as soon as you start over
volting and overclocking and stuff like
that so be very careful I mean this card
has no warranty anyway so I'm not that
worried about it so anyway yeah I'll be
back when I have the results
all right so here's my final 3d mark 11
score I'm using the extreme preset on
the overclocked GTX 590 now bear in mind
guys okay check this out temperatures
even in a benchmark so we're not even
talking when I'm intentionally stressing
the temps are up to 86 degrees so max
temps and max power consumption I'll
show you guys the power consumption
numbers in a bit here are significantly
up versus the stock card so here are the
clocks that I finalize done what just
got to get it to focus okay there we go
nope okay let's try this yeah yeah there
we go
all right it's a core voltage I have
maxed out the slider that is as much as
afterburner is going to allow us to give
it core clock we're up at 809 megahertz
so that's well over a stock GTX 580 and
the shader is correspondingly high
memory clock were up over 2.1 gigahertz
on the memory and the fan speed I have
left at Auto so I'm gonna run the stock
benchmark now cuz I didn't actually do
any 3dmark testing for my reviews and
then I will be able to give you guys
even more details so with our stock
clocks we get just over 3000 3d marks so
that gives us a yeah I guess it's not
that much of an improvement
so I guess Nvidia knew what they were
doing when they clocked this card at
what they did because I'm about to show
you guys well first of all here you can
see that the temperatures are much lower
so in this benchmark we peak at about 75
degrees so I'll show you guys what I run
into in terms of power consumption and
acoustics so there you have it guys we
can easily pull over 500 watts from the
wall I've seen it peak higher than that
in games like metro 2033 up as high as
around 550 to 570 watts from the wall
with the GTX 590 overclocked the way it
is one thing to note actually is that in
Metro 2033 I saw a bigger performance
and
than I did in 3d mark in 3d mark 11
I went from what was it a long about the
numbers here beside me
yeah 3d mark 11 I saw like less than 10
percent performance improvement but in
Metro 2033 it was closer to 15 percent
so I'm not really sure what's up with
that but those were sort of informal
testing numbers so I don't but - too
much stock in them as far as max temps
go it looks like this is pretty similar
to what we saw before so about 88
degrees is as high as it goes and since
it can't focus with anything there we go
88 degrees is about as high as we see it
go but it is significantly louder so
I'll throw a couple audio clips onto the
end of this one where I'll show the non
overclocked versus the overclocked to
GTX 590 thank you for checking out my
little video here on the limits of the
GTX 590 in terms of overclocking don't
