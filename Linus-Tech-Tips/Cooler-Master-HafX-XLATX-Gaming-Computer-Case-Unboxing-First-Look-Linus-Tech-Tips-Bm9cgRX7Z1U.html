to talk about this is the Coolermaster
1/2 X and really this comes down to a
complaint that I've had for quite a
while with EVGA and they're overly long
motherboards they've been releasing
motherboards like they're classified
four-way SLI their new SR 2 Super Record
2 dual slot are sorry dual socket LGA
1366 motherboard they've been releasing
motherboards with too many PCI slots
they're actually longer than a standard
case which is 7 PCI flood now the 1/2 X
fixes that complaint that I've had that
they're releasing these motherboards
that there are no cases for well now we
have a case for it so let's have a look
at the overall specs of this before we
take it out of the box it is a black
case it is made of steel in plastic
there's a bunch of boring stuff now
something that they have seemed to
forgotten here is that it is micro ATX
ATX ehx and it is also something called
X L ATX which is kind of an ATX that is
too long because if we come down here
PCI slots 9 so rather than having a
standard 7 PCI slots this case can
accept either motherboards with eight
slots and then an overhanging dual slot
card in the bottom slot or even a
motherboard with nine PCI slots o29 got
two too long like the classified for way
okay so cooling system this is probably
relevant included we have a 230
millimeter red LED fan at the front a
200 to 200 millimeter fans at the top
and one is optional okay so only one a
200 millimeter fan at the side and a 140
millimeter fan at the rear there's
apparently also a 120 millimeter fan
which is a VGA fan cover and then a VGA
holder has an optional 80 millimeter fan
so one of the big features of the 1/2 X
is actually also that it is
ready so it is ready for nvidia as
latest gtx to 470 and 480 graphics cards
that means it has really good GPU
cooling that kid it kind of goes without
saying okay we got an installation guide
here so this is going to tell you how to
install your components in the system
i'll actually just let you read that you
can freeze the frame if you want to
figure out oh this is neat USB 3.0
converting to USB 2.0 Cal blah I'm sure
they mean cable but that's that's a
pretty useful thing to know how to do
how to install the VGA bracket okay we
can kind of refer to this a little bit
later and then let's get the case out
let's have a look at it the first thing
I notice about it is that it is black
black everywhere black on the inside
black on the back black on the top very
nice that is what I like to see
the new black
we've got a plane flying overhead so I
don't know how well you're going to be
able to hear me but let's get all these
plastic bits off and have a look at this
case so the Masters hath line of cases
is all about half high air float so
we'll start at the front the entire
front of the case is covered in grills
so all of this is potentially if you've
gone a lot of exhaust going to be a
passive intake and then down here we
have I'm just going to use this as a
teaching at the front we have our 230
millimeter red LED pen up at the front
we've got all of our front connectivity
so they've got everything here we have
USB 3.0 SuperSpeed which you can convert
to extra USB 2.0 ports
we've got eSATA firewire USB 2.0 as well
as front audio so it has everything and
then this panel actually looks like you
might even be able to remove it and
mount something else there well maybe
not okay here we've got a little slider
okay so that has your fan LED button
that's pretty cool then a reset switch
as well as a power switch so those can
all be safely hidden for whatever reason
just kind of kind of cool to have little
things that slide around on the case
like that
okay the overall build of the thing
actually I'm just going to kind of see
what I think of it as soon as you fill
up a case like this it's going to be
really heavy but it's also very very
solid like you could easily put all of
my weight on it even when it's empty and
even though it has plastic to the
construction because you can see the way
that they've constructed the plastic is
very rugged
it's very reinforced and it also has
kind of a cool look to it it's along the
visual stylings of previous half cases
but it doesn't take everything out of
their book either so let's take the side
panel off side panel fit and finish is
pretty good let me just kind of put it
back on and see what I think of that
because it's not perfect by any means
but yeah it gets them there pretty good
so you can see even when we take it off
and put it back on there are no
unnecessary gaps in the case everything
fits in
really nice that's something hey you
can't actually take it for granted so
you just pull it away pull it out there
we go let's have a look at the inside
here that is a hardcore looking fan and
duct right there so besides the window
we've got this huge grill which you can
actually remove the fan from but still
leave the grill on so it'll still look
pretty cool and you can actually remove
this duct from the fan as well if you
don't want that but this fan is designed
to send as much air flow over the
graphics cards as is humanly ourfamily
possible you can see it can plug in
either using a three pin connector or
you can use the included four pin molex
adapter so we can go ahead and file this
side panel away and have a look at some
more aspects of this case the interior
once again it borrows a lot from
previous half cases so we've got cooler
masters three and a half inch or rather
this one has an SSD adapter already
included in it but I'm assuming yet you
can take that out so they're three and a
half inch drive bays now these look
really flimsy but as soon as you install
a hard drive in them they're really
really sturdy so I love their hard drive
mounting system personally and then
they've also gone and included a two and
a half inch adapter so if you have an
SSD boot drive just right out of the box
you can put a couple screws in it slide
that into there convenient tool list
system and clip it in awesome so it
takes up to one two three four five
three and a half inch bays here and then
what appears to be a hot swap module in
the front but we'll have a closer look
at that later actually I just want to
have a look at the overall layout of the
interior first so down here this is the
well they've got a little cool
designed by Coolermaster stamp on here
this is going to hold your power supply
alright so your power supply it goes
into the bottom of this case and they
don't have an option for a top mount
which I don't think really matters
you've got little rubber um hair right
my knife yeah I actually have a knife
today check that out alright so why
don't we sort of figure out how this
works
by removing this okay oh yeah this is
interesting this is the duct for the
Nvidia Fermi graphics cards this is part
of what makes it Fermi ready because
your ducting dedicated air flow to the
graphics cards using like kind of a
segmented zone cooling paradigm that we
first saw with the Antec P 180 okay but
you can actually remove this if you
don't want it if you don't like it you
can just pull it out just like that it's
only two thumb screws so it's no big
deal
okay so then I'm gonna now that I've
removed that I'm gonna go ahead and
remove my power supply bracket here
because honestly in a build that I'm
doing I probably won't use any of this
stuff so while something like this power
supply cover is great if you're not
using a modular power supply because you
can hide all the wires behind it if you
are using a modular power supply you're
probably just gonna pull it out anyway
what I mean hey if you think of
everything right so this box is probably
all of our accessories that's trapped in
just like that you can see the way
they've positioned the cooling holes
here there aren't actually any fan
mounts on them but the reason for that
is that they just wanted to have a nice
open well supported place to put your
power supply so even if you have one of
those ridiculously long power supplies I
mean they can be up to this long you
will have proper little rubber supports
for it you'll have your four screws at
the back and you'll have the right
ventilation spacing no matter where the
fan on your power supply is so that's
pretty cool as well and let's see what
else I want to talk about in the
interior here right right why don't we
just kind of cut right to the chase here
here it is this is one two three four
five six seven eight nine PCI slots and
here's an interesting thing there's
actually room for another slot right
here so even if you have a nine slot
motherboard you can even put a dual slot
card in the last one and you're still
not going to interfere with your power
supply and there's going to be a spot to
rest the card right in the case there so
that's pretty crazy
okay then we've also got the cutout for
the CPU cooler nice big cutout so pretty
much no matter where your CPUs position
you're going to be able to access the
backplate we've got our 140 millimeter
fan at the
we've got water cooling grommets here in
case you wanted to do an external water
cooling system now up at the top this is
a little bit of a disappointment but the
first one I've had about this case I
don't actually see a convenient place to
mount a radiator but that may just be
because I'm not I don't have a radiator
here to kind of line up against it
because something that I do see is that
there are a lot of sort of extraneous
looking mounting points in here so it's
quite possible that they do have the
holes there but I'm not seeing them so I
wish yeah I wish I had a radiator to try
it but I don't have one on me whoop
there we go I just undid the other panel
so let's have a quick look at that on
the inside we've got a bit of a sort of
textured thing going on here now this is
a smart thing that they've done you see
how this panel is not flat there's
actually quite a bit of bulge and rather
than just sort of having this be flat
and working the texture into this side
what they've actually done is they've
given you more room at the back of the
motherboard tray to route all of your
cables so with this kind of depth you
can route you can route all of your PCI
Express cables behind the video cards
and then with this slightly less depth
you can do the few cables required for
the eight pin around the back of the
motherboard in your 24 pin so that's a
really smart thing that they've worked
right into the case they've made it look
like just a design element but it's
there for a very practical reason so
that brings us around to the back where
we've got oh these are nice actually
we've got really really soft rubber
grommets to mount all of our power
search amount to route all of our power
supply cables through so these are the
kind that even if you have a cable
sticking through it and butting up
against it it's still going to snap
right back to its original place we have
a nice big hole at the bottom because I
mean in theory your routing as many as
eight PCI Express connectors through
this a 24 pin an 8 pin up to the back
you're mounting like you're putting tons
and tons of cables in here so it's great
that they have a nice big hole for that
okay we've got our five five and a
quarter inch rather six five and a
quarter inch bays these are all standard
tool d'affaires but personally I don't
mind that some people will complain that
they're not to list but
I mean oh they are to lists for ha for
them are to list my dad and then the
other to actually have the hot-swap
module mounted in them now I wish I
could figure out how that works because
it hmm you know it may not actually be
hot-swap it might just be like a
backplane thing although it looks like
hot-swap there's there's got to be a way
to do this so just bear with me here
I apologize for trying to figure this
out on camera but no I don't really I do
this all the time okay
take off the front bezel and see what we
can see what we can discover at the back
here far at the front routers behind the
front there that's what I'm ready to say
okay this is interesting I wonder if you
actually have to take off the top as
well as the front and cameraman is
complaining to me about how long this
video is so I guess I'll find out how
those work and I'll upload an annotation
never mind I got it I got it
there we go yes they are hotspot days so
I figured out how they were hello let me
pop the front bezel back in okay so you
just take these two clips at either side
push them in pull it out all you do is
screw your drive in it'll accept two and
a half inch or three and a half inch
drives you can see into the back plane
there so it accepts up to two drives so
that brings the three and a half inch
drive capacity up to a potential of
seven as well as the two and a half inch
drive capacity by default with this case
up to three let's see what else I want
to still cover uhm else do we got we
talked about xle so our camera cut off
no big deal let's have a look at the
front panel connectors here's our two
USB 3.0 connectors and then so these are
there's there's a guide in the in the
users manual for how to convert them to
USB 2.0 so yeah I'm guessing there will
be some way to do that we've got HD
audio we've got a hard drive LED we've
got our sort of standard power switch
power LED reset switch all of those
we've got our eSATA connection then we
have our regular USB 2.0 front header
and then we have our firewire front
header so no matter how what
connectivity options your motherboard
has you are going to be able to hook it
up in this case I just wanted to quickly
show the to Lush mechanism for the five
and a quarter inch page you just press
the button it locks in the drive you
press it again it unlocks the drive very
straightforward
okay now one thing that I totally forgot
about while I was doing the last segment
was the included accessories so what do
we have in here oh we got wheels hey
they really did think of everything
this case cuz I mean one of the things I
said was all it's kind of heavy there
you go
they put wheels on it oh here here we go
so here's how to adapt the USB 3.0
cables to USB 2.0 headers all you do is
this you plug this in here hide it
somewhere and all of the oh no that
doesn't work okay I have no idea
interesting you know what I bet I can
figure it out that it's not too hard I'm
willing to yeah yeah I'm willing to
wager that at the front of the case
there's actually ports that you plug
these into and then you just run a
regular USB 2.0 header very nice okay we
have an eight pin extension cable
like I said they thought of everything
because a lot of motherboard are a lot
of power supplies aren't going to have a
long enough eight pin to account for
those extra two slots of height so there
you go they include one and this I think
is something to do with the graphics
card duct I believe it supports the
graphics cards unless you're shipping
the system around is probably not a big
deal but I think it kind of goes in like
that or something okay and then left but
not least we have a big baggy of screws
mostly black screws all the ones you're
going to see your black nice little
finishing touches like that black zip
ties as well as a little speaker you can
attach to your motherboard for dial
diagnostic purposes thank you for
