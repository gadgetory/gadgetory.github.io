unboxing of a kind of package I've never
really received before this is from AMD
and it is a fpp sample program kit
nothing on the outside of the package
besides that label on the front so let's
go ahead and get it opened up so here we
see some information about AMD is lando
or their fusion AP use we have the AMD a
four a six and eight eight so these are
all ap use that means they have a CPU
and a GPU component on the same package
of varying performance levels keep
opening it up this is kind of a
throwback color reminds me of the Athlon
64 that was the orange packaging color
that they used for that particular
processor in the AMD logo so first let's
see what AMD has to say for themselves a
discreet graphics experience without the
cost of an additional component plus
support for DirectX 11 optimizations
this is a much bigger deal than you
think because sure a low-end discrete
graphics card isn't going to run all the
latest DirectX 11 games at high details
and 2560 by 1600 resolution but you do
get support for things like direct
compute where your GPU on the CPU can
actually assist it with certain
functionality
all right dual graphics boosts visual
performance up to 75% so what's dual
graphics dual graphics is similar to
what we used to call hybrid crossfire
where the chipset had a GPU on it and
then that could work with and a
standalone PCIe graphics card so in this
case some of the lower end AMD graphics
cards are actually capable of working in
what they call now dual graphics mode to
improve the performance in DirectX 10
and DirectX 11 titles by using them
together next we have multi-core
processing with up to four high
performance course plus AMD turbo core
technology for optimized performance
where it's needed most
so multi-core processing what that means
is we've got up to four CPU cores on
here
that are each a slightly more efficient
than an older Athlon x2 or Apple on 2x4
sorry Athlon 2x4 so the older Athlon
course these a four a six and eight
cores are slightly more efficient
especially the a8 because they do have
the best onboard graphics as well as a
little bit more cache or certain other
higher-end features compared to the
other ones so what else we got in here
we have an AMD mug that says this is
charming I heart APU
all right we've got a shirt which is
probably a large oh it's an extra-large
so obviously it's not gonna fit me but
it has some kind of explosion on it I am
the first ok and then we have these
paper
let's see yep saying what's in here
there's an s2 heatsink no we don't want
to look at this necessarily and then
let's see if there's anything else in
here that might be interesting that's
pretty much it there's a copy of of this
as well and then we also have a
motherboard inside so why don't we make
this the unboxing for the a8 APU as well
I'm gonna do this motherboard separately
this is a socket fm1 motherboard to go
with a socket fm1 APU now FM one is
different from the a m2 m3 family of
processor sockets so you do need a new
motherboard in order to take advantage
of an APU so let's go ahead and see what
AMD has to say for themselves on the
outside of the CPU box you can combine
it with DirectX 11 graphic cards these
164 50 65 70 as well as the 66 70 hey on
the back we see the usual spiel okay
unrivaled DirectX 11 support
revolutionary APU harnesses the power of
unrivaled discrete level AMD Radeon HD
graphics small energy efficient design
yes that's one of the things that's
actually really cool about the APU
design is that the idle power
consumption compared to its closest
competitor
from the blue side is actually
significantly better due to the fact
that they've taken away so many
components by building the graphics chip
right on to the CPU at a very highly
integrated level so let's have a look at
the heatsink and I think you guys are
going to be quite surprised to see the
heatsink for this new AMD socket there
you have it it looks just like a
heatsink for any other AMD socket from
like the last six years or so going all
the way back to socket 754 where you've
got the two clips on either side okay
you got some fins you got a copper slug
what that means is that you can actually
use your old heatsink solution as long
as it's rated for a TV P up to 100 watts
remember these do have a graphics chip
on them as well so they kicked out a
little bit more heat than a standalone
CPU would so that's why the higher TDP
even though the overall system power
consumption will still be very very low
so you can use any properly rated
heatsink that was compatible with like
pretty much realistically if you still
own it and it's still high performance
you can use it on your APU very cool
oh it has a PWM fan in case you guys
were wondering so that's a four pin fan
and next we have some kind of paper
documentation showing different sockets
okay I haven't seen a socket fm1 yet but
I will soon so I'll be telling you guys
all about that and my motherboard
unboxings I'm gonna do a few FM one
motherboards and there it is there is
the eight 3800 series APU so it looks
pretty much like any other AMD chip from
the last little while ooh the pin
pattern though that is a noticeably
different and you can see actually oh
cool look at that so it has a dot here
marking it it has the usual triangle
marking this one and then it has a dot
on the other side and no dot here so my
guess is that that's going to be a lot
to do with making sure it's oriented
correctly in the motherboard socket last
but not least we have an AMD vision
sticker which you can put on your case
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the a
the first APU don't forget to subscribe
