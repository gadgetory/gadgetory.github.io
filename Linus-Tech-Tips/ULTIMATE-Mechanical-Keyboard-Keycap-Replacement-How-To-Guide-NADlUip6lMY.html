and things are starting to get serious
you like to take long walks in the park
you've enjoyed your fair share of
candlelit dinners
you're both ready it's time for things
to go a little bit further welcome to
the ultimate mechanical keyboard guy
before making your move you'll need to
gather some information about your
keyboard start by identifying your
keyboard stem this is the part of the
keyboards exposed switch which connects
it to its own key cap now usually these
stems are unique to which switch they
are on like Cherry MX toper or Alps but
luckily there's some exceptions for
example the razer blackwidow z' razer
mechanical switches made by kail will
work due to inherited Cherry MX 10
compatibility and in more extreme cases
the one we'll be showing you today you
have the Nova touch from Coolermaster
where they have adopted the stem of a
toe / switch to work with cherry MX
compatible key caps this guy will focus
on upgrading keyboards with Cherry MX
switches or in other situations Cherry
MX compatible stems because they are by
far the most widely available
replacement key caps once you've
identified your keyboard stem things get
a lot simpler is your keyboard ISO or a
NSI layout this is one of the easiest
things to identify by just looking at
your enter key on an ISO layout keyboard
the in Turkey will be taller and have a
little bit of an odd shape on an a NSI
keyboard your enter key will be flat and
just a horizontal bar fairly
straightforward next you have the size
of your keyboard the two most common
sizes are just a standard full-sized
keyboard or an 80% of the size of a
standard full-sized keyboard which is
also known as a 10 keyless keyboard due
to the fact that it doesn't have the
number keypad that you would find on a
standard full-sized keyboard on the
right hand side there are also some fun
but less common sizes like the 60%
sometimes referred to as poker and a
couple other sizes as well knowing the
layout and size of your keyboard will
help you buy the right amount of key
caps and for the final bit of
information you just need to know if
your keyboard is backlit or not
this won't technically restrict you in
any way as you will be able to you put
any Cherry MX compatible key cap on top
of the backlit switch but if you want to
be able to see the backlighting effect
of your keyboard it will limit your
options now this part is all about you
what do you want are you looking to
replace all of your key caps in this
case we actually have quite a few
options to consider first off you have
the type of plastic you have three main
options there
with abs abs is the most common type of
plastic found in keycaps today and is
probably what was on your keyboard to
start with abs is very adaptable
allowing for things like clear lettering
which lets backlighting shine through
just the lettering on your key cap the
second option is if you want the entire
key cap to be transparent that is KBC it
allows for a unique look and it also
allows for the entire key cap to shine
while the backlight is on and finally if
you're looking for something more
textured and more durable you'd want to
check out pbt key caps that's my
personal favorite it can be a little bit
more expensive but some people including
myself swear by the very subtle but
definitely noticeable texture
differences also pvt key caps are shine
resistant due to their durability making
it much more difficult for the oils in
your hand to wear them away giving them
that glossy appearance that you'll find
typically on old keyboards a definite
bonus one thing I left out about these
materials is the general feel it's hard
to quantify but especially if you bottom
out your keys when pressing them down
the material of your key cap can
entirely change the feel of typing due
to how it reacts with the base of your
keyboard and its weight compared to your
stock key caps next you have to decide
how you want them printed you've got
some options for locations you can have
the printing on the top of the key you
can have no printing at all leaving them
completely blank or you can even have
side printing also known sometimes as
ninja printing which results in a
stylish looking blank top with the
printing on the front of the key cap
just in case you need to check them out
every now and then but that's not all
when it comes to printing now you need
to pick what type of printing you
actually want first off we have pad
printing it's extremely common due to
its inexpensive application and ability
to print in more than one color but it
definitely has its drawbacks as well not
only can you feel where the key cap has
already been printed but the printing
will wear away relatively quickly which
makes that feeling even more odd as the
printing starts to disappear and it
loses its shape then we come to laser
etching or laser engraving which is nice
because it doesn't wear out nearly as
fast as pad for
and it will last a very long time under
standard environments you can still feel
the printing but some people don't
really mind this option as it generally
won't change its feel much over time
next we have dye sublimation which is
more expensive than the previous options
and can only be set in one color which
is darker than the rest of the key cap
as the dye has to be set into the
plastic after it is formed but it won't
really wear out and can be set in
multiple colors and doesn't have any
noticeable textures to it and last but
definitely not least we have a double
shot injection molding this method is
definitely the most expensive but the
quality is beyond question these key
caps are comprised of two entirely
separate pieces which unfortunately
limits you to only two colors but also
makes it so that the lettering will
literally never wear out and also
doesn't have any noticeable texture to
it which brings us to the overall shape
you can choose between cylindrical the
most common type flat which is usually
found on laptop keyboards or spherical
which is mainly found on extremely old
keyboards and stuff like typewriters I
hope you chose cylindrical as finding
flat or spherical key caps will be
extremely difficult to say the least if
you're only looking to replace a very
small amount of key caps like say a
couple F keys or just your Escape key
you will have many more options in the
custom sections of some stores including
things like fully 3d printed key caps in
the form of skulls or pistols or some
other interesting custom printing to
make your keyboard uniquely yours the
job of a keyboard dampener is to reduce
the clack of your keyboard not to click
the click on a keyboard is the sound the
switch makes as it actuates on a clicky
switch to help tell the difference
between linear and clicky switches click
here to check out why missus fast as
possible episode explaining the
differences between Cherry MX switches
the clack on a keyboard actually doesn't
have anything to do with the switch
necessarily and is just to send your
keyboard makes when you bottom out the
key cap hitting it against the base
board of the keyboard starting with a
rings the most common dampeners there
are a ton of differences aside from just
color
there's thickness which is pretty
self-explanatory and durometer or
hardness thickness will mainly a
back to the travel distance with under
two millimeters affecting it slightly
above two millimeters affecting it in a
very noticeable way around two
millimeters is recommended for say
clicky switches with above two
millimeters only really being
recommended for linear switches then we
have the durometer which gets slowly
harder starting at forty al onward to
fifty a - r with 40 a - L feeling quite
squishy and 50 a - are feeling not as
hard as hitting the bottom of your
keyboard but still quite hard our rings
are available in two main rubber
materials nitrile and APD em don't worry
about this as they're functionally the
same moving on from a rings we've got
soft landing pads the main source of
these soft landing pads is elite
keyboards com although they can be found
elsewhere and these are rather easy to
make on your own if you can find a good
material from elite keyboards they come
in either a firm grey or a soft black
for varying effect and lastly we have
surprisingly enough dental bands the
requirements for a Cherry MX o ring is
an inner diameter of five millimeters
and an outer diameter of somewhere
around eight millimeters dental bounds
are inexpensive and available in many
different varieties they can be found on
eBay or honestly just from your local
dentist office so you've done your
research and you know what's the best
for both of you you're ready to make
your move but first you need to acquire
supplies in the small niche but awesome
world of custom mechanical keyboards
there is a surprising amount of places
to buy things from from the widely known
WASD keyboards who were kind enough to
supply us with the key cast we'll be
using today to the Wow
this really looks like this websites
gonna scam you out of my money but is
actually somehow legit vendee o eSports
also known as q10
for a pretty extensive list of vendors
of keycaps dampeners and more please
check the forum link in the description
down below once your new key caps
arrived it's time to get down to
business when engaging in the delicate
process of key cap removal first and
foremost you need to be gentle and
always use the right tools for the job
you'll need preferably two key cap
pullers wire pullers are ideal but if
you can find plastic ones those will
work - or even an improvised paper-based
wire puller but
just don't use your fingers a coin a
screwdriver or anything of that nature
one precaution with removing key caps in
general is that you need to make sure
that you don't pull the entire switch up
off the keyboard when you do pull it if
you have a keyboard that has switches
going directly into the PCB this could
be a problem but if you have a keyboard
that has switches going into a plate
which is in the middle it should be fine
but I would just check either way that
your puller is only grabbing the key cap
before pulling up PCV mounted switches
aren't all that common but it's better
to be safe than sorry there's nothing
too complicated about normal square
alphanumeric keycaps so just go slow and
be patient but some of the bigger ones
can be a little bit trickier first we'll
go over how to remove dummy stabilizers
as they're probably the most common all
you need to do is spread your wire
puller over the key cap ensuring you are
only grabbing the cap or slide your
plastic puller over the cap which will
only grab the cap then proceed to wiggle
gently if the key cap just won't come
off for some weird random reason got
something like a flathead screwdriver a
coin a credit card or your hopes and
dreams and hold down the switch below
the key cap and then continue to wiggle
a little bit harder and then hopefully
the key cap will come off at that point
for the spacebar the method is
essentially the same but you need to
place a puller on each end of the
spacebar and lift up equally now things
someone help you hold down your keyboard
at this point would probably help now if
you have wire based stabilizers things
change a little bit most the keys are
gonna be the same process as that dummy
switch stabilizer keyboard we just dealt
with but the longer keys like shifts and
our spacebar and backspace will all have
a wire based system which will take some
dealing with once you've removed the
keys neighboring these longer keys you
can actually start working on them
directly as an example we will remove
the space bar so position your key
pullers on each end of the space bar and
wiggle very very gently eventually you
will feel it give way from that switch
that's in the very middle but it will
still be attached to the exposed
external wire that is going around the
outside so if you just push on one side
of the key cap it will free from that
side and then you can easily just pull
it off of the other side be very gentle
in this as well but it should be pretty
easy once the key is free you'll notice
pegs underneath you should remove these
with either your fingers or
but don't shove something like a
flathead under that little loop as you
may risk breaking it if you are having
trouble use a flathead to pry it
directly from its base not from under
the loop and then that should actually
be fine
another thing to note is that the other
wire base stabilized keys will have a
shorter wire which will be more stiff so
be ready to press a little bit harder on
the side of the key cap when you're
freeing it from the wire so at this
point all of your key caps have been
removed if this is a keyboard you have
been using for quite a while this will
be a great time to do some keyboard
maintenance so grab some canned air a
compressor or a data vac and give your
keyboard a good air base spray down to
get some of the chunkier parts out of
there for more delicate cleaning you can
use a clean cloth and a small amount of
water or isopropyl 99% alcohol but
please note that if your key caps are UV
coated you should only use the water
alcohol can eat away UV coating also if
the casing is starting to yellow you can
use Windex which only furthers my theory
that Windex can pretty much clean
anything another thing to note is that
if you happen to break any small pieces
or the entire upgrade of your keyboard
you can grab replacement inserts wires
or even entire switches from WASD
keyboards and some other places as well
which will be linked in the forum
discussion which you can find linked to
under the video down below in the
description when moving up your keyboard
you really only need to lube up specific
spots along the stabilizer bars or on
the inserts and stuff like that and even
then the amount of leave required is
very low the guide I usually use on how
much Lube to use is pretty much
equivalent to the head of a computer
case screw I have many of them laying
around and it's just pretty easy to
access all I can really stress here is
that less is more it's easy to add a
little bit more Lube later on but it can
be very annoying to take it off the lube
I would recommend is finished line
Xtreme fluoro it is 100% teflon grease
based lube that is widely used by bike
knife and gun enthusiasts and apparently
keyboard enthusiasts as well as it is
already widely recommended almost
everywhere on the internet for switch
stabilizer lubricant some enthusiasts
recommend removing your keyboard every 6
to 12 months but as I don't really
expect many of you to do
that try to at least do it when you're
swapping your key caps out like now
finally we are at installation
surprisingly enough possibly one of the
easiest parts of this entire process for
this part turn on your PC a fire up a
word processor and then proceed to press
each button on your keyboard to check
what it does before putting the
appropriate key cap on just kidding you
have a spare keyboard use this video or
maybe look up a picture reference online
to find the proper key cap placement
take it slow and you'll be fine
now if you bought some oring x' or
dental bands before you have to install
your key caps with those first so you'll
need to push the ring or band onto the
cylinder underneath the cap after you've
installed all the rings or bands you
just proceed like normal but this time
push a little bit harder once the switch
is installed to make sure that the
dampener Aero ring is pushed all the way
up into the cap if you bought dampening
pads all you need to do is place those
pads around each switch before
installing your key caps like normal if
you have a common dummy stabilizer based
keyboard the process of installing keys
is quite simple
all we have to do is line up the
cylinder under the key cap with the
stems on your switches and push down
gently if you have wire based
stabilizers it's just the reverse of
uninstalling them once the keys will be
the same as the installation process of
the dummy stabilizers but whenever you
have long key caps like space bar you
will need to install the pegs that you
removed from the previous key caps with
the long part of the peg facing the back
of the cap then you need to stand the
wire up on the keyboard and hook one of
the insert pegs on to the wire push in
the direction of the hooked in end and
then hook in the other side once you
have each side hooked in you just need
to push down on the key gently onto the
key switch and voila
you're done alright guys while I give
you a chance to enjoy some sexy glam
