sonic Pro box h8 2 - s u3 s - I think
what they mean to say is it's an 8 X
it's an 8 Bay USB 3 external hard drive
enclosure and there's a couple things
that are pretty cool about it so I'm
going to run through everything media
sonic has to say about it and then I'm
going to tell you what I think is
interesting so first of all it supports
8 hard drives a different branding
capacity good for whatever you want in
there although with an enclosure like
this I don't think I really recommend it
ok it supports up to 24 terabytes
yes that's 3 terabytes times 8 bays it
has one button interface selection so
you can flexible alternative interface
selection by simply pressing the button
ah yes so the interface meaning either
eSATA or USB 3 because it does support
both of those transfer methods it's got
a security lock because you don't want
people running along and stealing your
hard drives force convection process for
cooling power sync powers off and on
synchronize with the PC that's very
handy because you don't need to access
data that's plugged in by eSATA unless
the system is powered on very nice
supports hard drive hot swap 8 hard
drives supported and smart fan comes
with auto / manual modes 3 levels of
speed for best convention supports
Windows 7 u s-- at a USB 3 we've
mentioned that before
alright moving along to the side we see
what it looks like from the back moving
along to the back we see what it looks
like from the front and the side so far
this is all stuff that's been covered
force convection process power sink one
button but ok moving back along to the
other side ok hold on a minute
ah here we go this is interesting here
is a comparison chart so we're showing
USB 3 versus eSATA versus USB to USB 2
slow eSATA is fast and USB free a super
speed so in practical terms USB 3 and
eSATA probably aren't going to give you
much of a difference in terms of
performance because the way I would
install drives in an enclosure like this
is going to be well not able to
saturate an eSATA connection so these
are all theoretical maximums that you
see in that graph on the back let's go
ahead and open it up and don't worry I
will tell you the part about what I
think is interesting about it coming
soon first the accessories
so the first accessory is an eSATA cable
very nice next accessory is a USB 3
cable that's a 2b oh cameraman says it
is Mac compatible so thank you for that
cameraman
next we have hard drive rails including
a screw driver for you to install said
rails and screws for you to install said
rails
next we have a power supply cable so the
power supply is built right into the
unit which is nice because you don't
have to deal with that external power
brick nonsense ok we've got nice closed
cell phone very very thick so you've got
like almost 2 inches of foam on every
side of the unit so I wouldn't worry too
much about it being damaged in trend wow
it's heavy once you load this thing up
with hard drives it's gonna weigh like a
ton all right this baby up there it is
the pro box aid a USB 3 eSATA hard drive
enclosure so why don't we start at the
front since that's a very natural place
to start how are you open it you know
what why don't I open it first give me a
sec so by plugging in the key here I can
unlock ah and open the door so you can
see I can remove my hard drive cage
doors then I install my rails on the
drives and then I throw the drives back
into here so I am finally going to tell
you what I think is so cool about this
enclosure this enclosure includes an 8
port multiplier so what that means is if
you want to access all of the theta
ports so that is the 8 ports you can do
that whole thing through
single eSATA interface back here or USB
3 interface the eSATA one is more
interesting to me though so a poor
multiplier this is not a raid box this
is just a straight one SATA 2 8 SATA
port multiplier which is great because
compared to competing solutions which
might have to be Sat interfaces on the
back and then 2 4 port multipliers this
allows you to configure a raid across up
to 8 drives using a single port so you
can actually plug this in to your Intel
to your Intel controller assuming your
board uses the Intel controller 40 SATA
and you can configure like an 8 drive
raid 5 for example which is awesome now
if the Intel controller is not fast
enough for you you don't want to use
like a software mode you can actually
take proper raid cards and you can plug
them into one port here now you're going
to be bad with limited in terms of the
single eSATA connection but even eight
drives in like a raid 5 or a raid 6 it
shouldn't be bottleneck to too much by
an eSATA 300 megabit per second
connection so did I say three ethnic
three three gigabit per second
connection shouldn't be bottleneck too
much so that means that you are going to
have excellent performance to up to
eight drives at a time so cameraman is
showing us the eSATA and the USB 3
indicators the fan indicators as well as
the eSATA and USB 3 indicators a I'm not
sure which is which ok finally we have
the interface change button the sync
button and the fan button so these are
all the LEDs and whatnots another thing
that's interesting about this particular
drive enclosure is that it looks very
nice see it's got like a nice matte
black finish going on there on the back
we can see 280 millimeter fans and
what's cool about those fans as they are
easily user replaceable yes media sonic
will not void you or your warranty for
replacing those fans with something else
I think that is a great feature right
there
there's our built-in power supply down
there at the bottom that's part of what
gives the unit its weight finally at the
back we have a Kensington lock right
here so that nobody just runs along
steals your whole 24 terabyte
Tower of
precious family memories and then runs
off with it and I think that is pretty
much everything I wanted to say about
this eight-b-- a hard drive tower so I'm
going to go ahead close it up take the
key and swallow it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
