shall we let's say that I'm your
grandmother and here I am on my computer
that you put together for me oh I don't
know 10 12 years ago and the hardware
was pretty good then but these days it's
run in a tick slow so you know I'm just
doing grandmotherly things like firing
up the Internet's to browse the web
oof catching up on my tech tech news
maybe I open up a couple of tabs gotta
get that news from all the sources oh
boy he's still loading is this tab still
loading maybe I'll watch a video in the
meantime with the VLC look at that
right-click delay didn't add a thing of
beauty fairness and while I'm waiting
for that maybe I'll enjoy a nice little
game of pinball in 3d okay I think you
see where we're going with this it's
time for grant to finally give in to
your incessant nagging and upgrade the
old machine but then just as she's about
to do it
she's browsing the Facebook and she
finds an ad for oh thank you
the extra PC which claims to breathe new
life into old computers for anywhere
from 49.99 to $79.99 but could it be the
magic bullet that it claims to be or is
it just another predatory product
designed to take money from the elderly
and tech illiterate there's only one way
for us to find out Oh
after this message from glass wire with
glassware you can instantly see your
current and past network activity detect
malware and block badly behaving apps on
windows and android news offer code
linus to get 25% off glass wire at the
link below
all right so my understanding is there's
a few different Oh Anthony's in the
video alright my understanding is
there's a few different versions of the
extra PC so I'm holding the extra PC pro
64 gigabyte and this is the one we spent
80 US dollars on right and then you've
got I've got the turbo 32 which is much
smaller and I spent I think $49.99 on it
okay not too bad now something that's
immediately noticeable about these
things is that these are just I mean
this one they didn't even cover up the
branding this is just a SanDisk
Cruiser blade Cruiser blade 32 gigs so
that's a USB 2 and this would cost you
somewhere in the neighborhood and I
can't be more than like 10 bags yeah
roughly and then this I mean they did
they put a sticker on this one at least
I'm just gonna okay oh there we go
and this one's a cruiser glide 3.0 64
gigs so that's USB 3 but for our
particular old computer we're not gonna
get any any benefit out of that anyway
yeah we only have 2.0 okay but I mean
they're probably I mean I'm sure they
sort of tell people that no really nope
they just say that it gives you speed
large storage capacity and file res what
is file res software I'm guessing it's
some kind of recovery software also
check out these was prices anywhere from
fifty to a hundred and sixty dollars you
know this thing better be amazing
alright
so should we just should we just crack
it open let's fire this thing up sure
let's do it uh-oh oh yeah you know what
and you're done bud okay so do you want
to do the turbo one anyway just cuz then
we get we can see what that file red
soccer is all about I think it's
identical otherwise okay cool
well what what is this like a Core 2
quad or something uh no it's a pentium d
well let's let's see if it can make this
feel snappy then maybe there's something
to it all right extra PC they've got
their own boot logo they did an FS check
on the actual hard drive please choose a
password for your administrator account
Wow I'm gonna go with password I need
something I can remember in order to
begin using all the great features we
need to set up a few additional
applications these applications require
that you are connected to the internet
something can be downloaded and
installed and it looks like oh I assumed
that that was Network but it oh it is
wired connection one it looks like it
picked up both our wired and Wi-Fi NICs
yep
ok both real dick alright let's go ahead
and do this to accept the EULA for VLC
media player rhythm Vox media player
move on to restricted add-ons
it'll be flash ok this is all stuff that
I would probably install yep ok ok so
everything gets installed to the extra
PC USB stick and it does not use your
hard drive fascinating well based on how
long it's taking to install fonts we
might be asking for a lot so you would
probably recognize this what is this
based on probably
Lubuntu which is a lightweight distro of
Ubuntu based on that giving linus linux
is already looking like a bad idea yes
we'll talk more about that a little bit
later thank you David ok we're tired of
waiting for the TrueType fonts to
install yeah we want to cancel we're
done ok it looks like it's not gonna
prompt us to do that again so why don't
we poke around in here
it's totally grande oriented so we've
got Thunderbird email client is that
even still up
it it is it got discontinued not picked
up again it's got a dedicated link to
Facebook which presumably will open in
Firefox web-browser here and that is an
old Firefox logo yeah so there is not a
whole heck of a lot to this is there no
there's lebra --this there's Firefox and
for Grandma
anyway there is no obvious way to add
more applications not really usually in
a user friendly operating system like
Ubuntu or Manjaro or what-have-you
there'll be like an add or remove
software yeah but in this case I mean I
know what it is but now let's try file
res ready to find and save your files
with one click I'm gonna try this with
one click approach go I hear the hard
drive ticking yeah it's you can see that
it's it's mounted the drive and Program
Files oh it's just finding everything
now did it actually grab the pictures
that you put on specifically to test it
um look sleep it's all Program Files
here we go here it is oh ok what we
don't know is how it handles if you have
more data than will fit on a USB stick
hmm but that's a little bit beyond the
scope of this investigation I think so I
guess the point we're getting at here is
that if gran is God has got the
wherewithal to learn Linux which you
know what if all she's ever gonna look
at is Facebook and email and Kindle and
Pinterest maybe isn't even that hard
mm-hmm no probably not but if you're
gonna put the effort in to learn how to
use Linux maybe you should put the
effort into learning how to create your
own bootable Linux USB which Anthony has
created for us complete with high end
graphics how long did it take you to
create this thing Anthony about an hour
about an hour okay okay so what am I
looking at here
this is Manjaro Linux it's a relatively
lightweight modern Linux distribution
based on Arch Linux got it
that's our hard drive hmm so getting
into our documents and settings and any
pictures we left behind is basically as
simple as just navigating for them yep
did you pre configure it with Firefox or
does that just come it comes with
Firefox out of the box great well let's
have a look at our YouTube experience
then since that was the last thing we
looked at on extra PC again Firefox is
not going to be hardware accelerated so
a couple drop frames here and there and
yeah
oh wait wait yes oh yeah yeah it's a hot
mess
what else did we try do we just want
like some general responsiveness fire up
some OpenOffice you know yeah we fire up
some OpenOffice I mean it's still it's
all gonna be USB - so it's gonna be
comparable as far as load times go but
sure so let's create a writer document
where do you put what you want to call
it here okay sure beautiful did you have
to install any drivers or anything or no
the auto detection is pretty good okay
cool
oh look at this it's got chromium and
everything is this all pre-installed
stuff I didn't i pre-installed chromium
you did yeah okay everything else is
pre-installed including steam heating
steam yeah how about that
normally steam is only available in
Ubuntu in terms of overall
responsiveness no maybe it isn't
actually much worse let's just open up
our news
no it's probably about a slow yeah you
can only ask so much of a pentium d okay
why don't we try and why don't we try
and do one more thing let's play some
grand friendly games on Steam okay that
framerate though yeah
well it's running at full HD but it's
running I realized now that I've never
actually played peggle what yeah Oh Ted
rocks its pachinko oh yeah extreme fever
you're dead okay all right Anthony let's
go head-to-head how do we head-to-head
with one mouse take turns oh okay all
right
what oh that was the tutorial level no
forget it and we're done extra PC your
closing thoughts it's not as bad as I
thought it would be that file a record
whatever it was called programs far res
yeah actually worked pretty well I
wasn't expecting it to but it did it
pulled off all the files that would be
considered important to most people
aside from the fact that it's really old
and the it wouldn't install the fonts
which would have given grant a little
bit of trouble yeah I mean it's it's
just straight Xubuntu with some extra
fluff on it and it's not too bad but for
the price now I'm actually going to take
up a contrary position here because I
think the price is really reasonable the
extra time it would take them to faff
about creating a bootable Linux USB 42
$80 is perfectly reasonable the one
thing I do take issue with here is that
it's advertised as a resurrector of old
machines when as we've clearly
demonstrated it's not a magic bullet you
don't go from not being able to play
youtube videos and open documents to
suddenly being able to do that you are
still very much limited by the hardware
that you have
and there is going to be a learning
curve for grande and that's something
that I feel like they could be a lot
more transparent about in their
advertising so my issue here is not with
the product but rather just with the
claims the product itself I actually
don't mind it yeah I thought I would
hate it I was I was expecting this video
to just be crapping all over extra PC
but you can I think probably see the
tone shift as we make our way through it
yeah a lot happens at your front door
without you ever even realizing it and
ring is on a mission to reduce crime in
communities the video doorbell to can
help you get that done thanks to its
1080p HD resolution with a hundred and
sixty degree vision including night

it'll alert you if anything is happening

a busy street and it features two-way
audio so you can talk to whoever's at
the front door it's Wi-Fi capable so you
