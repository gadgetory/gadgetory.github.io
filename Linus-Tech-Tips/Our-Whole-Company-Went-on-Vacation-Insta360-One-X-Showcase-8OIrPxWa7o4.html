Linus Media Group recently went on a
company retreat to bents National Park
where we hiked and hung out and also
played lots of video games but what you
may not have known was that before we
went insta 360 reached out to us to
showcase their new one X 360 camera in a
sponsored video it was actually perfect
timing because I wanted to take some
nice high resolution panoramas in damp
anyway so we said yes and we took it
with us and now all of that in the past
so I can show you
if you've never used a 360 camera before
the first pro tip is to do less because
you do not have to point the camera at
whatever it is that you want to capture
it's already capturing everything around
you and this sounds simple but it is
surprisingly hard to break the habit of
shooting at things because we're so used
to pointing the lens in the same
direction as our eyes once you let that
sink in though suddenly you can forget
all about the camera and just focus on
what you're doing whether that's
snowboarding or hiking or fun about my
wife trying to do a push-up oh that's ok
anyway you can also invent completely
new use cases like having a single
camera act as both your dash cam and
your backup camera at the same time the
next thing you need to get used to is
that your selfie stick is going to be
invisible in the final footage I mean
you still look like a turd when you're
taking the footage but once you're done
it actually looks way more natural
because it can Stitch the footage
together from the two lenses to create a
blind spot that hides the stick and the
footage itself looks really good so the
1x does 4k at 50 frames per second it
also supports 5.7 K at 30fps which is a
nice to have because having that little
bit of extra resolution to work with
might be nice if you want to crop in to
get just one part of the image and then
it also does 3k at a hundred frames per
second which you could use for slow
motion or better yet Zack Snyder asked
dynamic slow-mo editing which can be
done using the 1x companion app actually
the app is pretty helpful overall first
of all for footage preview because who
wants to wait until they're back at the
hotel to find out that there was poop on
the lens the whole time and then inside
the app you can pan around zoom in and
out and then if you zoom out far enough
you actually get little planet mode
which always reminds me of Dragon Ball Z
when
Goku's training on King Kai's planet
with the intense like gravity and stuff
anyway that's off-topic
the point is this camera will make you
super Sayan sand saying I don't you know
I've never watched Dragonball Z but do I
look like I'm 12
yes but Dragon Ball Z wasn't a thing yet
you yes this camera will make you Super
Saiyan warning camera may not actually
make you Super Saiyan or increase your
power level in any way in terms of
creative possibilities you can publish
360 videos that your friends can pan
around in but you can also export like
have you called non 360 video video flat
video so you can use the app to enter
free capture mode and then sort of play
director by pointing the camera and then
changing the angle to frame the shots
that you want and then you can edit
together shots from multiple different
clips in your video so basically yes
this camera will make you James Cameron
and then hopefully we have another
warning warning camera may not actually
make you James Cameron or allow you to
visit the Titanic or travel to Pandora
in any way probably the most fun way to
use the 1x though is the mode that they
call bullet time which for those of you
boarded to 2000 I guess is a reference
to the 1999 movie The Matrix which I
guess I was also 12 when it came out
what year is it no I was 14 I can't do
that forget it it doesn't matter the
point is on the 1x all you need is a
rope or if you want to be slightly less
jank this special handle that screws
into the selfie stick
so that you can swing it over your head
like a madman while your friends try to
shoot your crotch with arrows it's a
really cool effect and it's made
possible by the one axis flow state
image stabilization which is good enough
to even make dog footage watchable which
is pretty impressive
