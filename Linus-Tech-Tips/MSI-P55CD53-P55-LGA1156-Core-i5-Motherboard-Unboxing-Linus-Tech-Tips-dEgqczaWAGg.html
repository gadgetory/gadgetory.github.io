p55 boards from MSI now we already
showed you the g65 when I got my early
review sample now let's take a look at
the p55 CD 53 now you'll notice that the
box color is a little bit different from
the GD 65 and the GD 80 and that's
because this is their mainstream series
okay so it has a C in the title and it's
a green box that's how you can tell that
it's a mainstream or classic series
board so let's get this box open here
and see what we can find inside so
you've got a still pretty good accessory
package so you've got your CD
you've got your drivers and utilities
MSI extras user guide quick installation
guide OC Genie manual that's cool the
one I had didn't come with a manual for
that so I still don't know what it does
Winky is also included which is I didn't
know last time here's the manual but
Winky is like an instant-on feature for
the board okay then we got a floppy
cable IO cover couple SATA cables an IDE
cable nothing particularly exciting on
the accessory front you can tell this is
a lower-end board then the GD 65 and the
GD 80 so now let's get the board out of
the anti-static baggie here if I can get
this tape to release on the back there
we go and here we have it the p55
CD six five so let's have a look at the
i/o shield first so we don't have any
eSATA we don't have any digital audio
it's a far more bare-bones board but we
do have 10 USB ports ps2 Gigabit
Ethernet and 7.1 audio and then let's
have a look at the expansion slots that
we've got on this board so you've got
your 1 second overclocking OC Genie
let's get that sticker off so we've got
three PCI 3 PCIe 1x and a PCIe 16x slot
now the layout is otherwise very similar
including down here we've got the OC
Genie button right there we've got an
onboard power button which is very
exciting to see on such an entry-level
sort of price point board you've also
got your base clock adjustment buttons
here which we did a blog video showing
the the use for then you've got your
chipset heatsink
eight SATA ports if I could just get the
camera around here so these are off the
Southbridge and these are off the J
micron chipset that also powers the IDE
port your power ports are in their ideal
locations along the right-hand edge of
the board and up at the very top left
corner and then here you've got your
typical LGA 1156 socket you can put four
dims of ddr3 memory and this board even
at this low price point while there's a
truck going past there's a purely inter
truck headed to our warehouse behind me
here so I'm gonna have to speak pretty
loudly I think or maybe we'll just wrap
it up we've got dr. Moss and there you
have it that is the p55
CD 53 motherboard from MSI thanks for
