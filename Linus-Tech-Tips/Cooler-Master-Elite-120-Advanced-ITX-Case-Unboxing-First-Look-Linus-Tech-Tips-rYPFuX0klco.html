the cooler Master Elite 120 advanced
this is an ITX case that exists within a
very small form factor compared to some
of its competition which is ITX but
actually has a much bigger form factor I
think hopefully we know welcome you know
I'm just going to say so the BitFenix
prodigy is sort of that hot ITX case
that lots of people are talking about
but my observation about the BitFenix
prodigy is that it's really cool and
everything but it's actually not that
small I mean you could you could easily
if you look at the internal layout of
the prodigy you could actually fit and n
ATX born in there without making the
case really any bigger so what if you
wanted a truly small ITX system that can
still accept a fair amount of hardware
have great cooling and is very
inexpensive so the elite 120 might be
the case for you let's take a quick look
at what Coolermaster has to say for
themselves so we're not gonna worry too
much about this we'll get to that later
and nothing and uh-hah supports up to
three fans for extreme grooving if I
have a pen in my pocket I'm gonna circle
that because that's obviously dream okay
Mini ITX with ATX power supply support
for easy upgrades this is really
important
aluminum finish on the front panel okay
so let's get this going here going to
put that pen away because nothing else
could be extreme enough to justify that
pen ever again
I'm not teasing somebody here I just
really did think it was that dream um
okay I excited and I was teasing so guys
to be clear there's nothing extreme
cooling about an ITX enclosure if you
can get things running cool enough to
you know overclock a little bit then
like that's fantastic but don't don't be
too don't be too worried if you don't
get like the maximum overclock that you
would have seen on a regular ATX or
larger enclosure
you know there's awesome cases from the
likes of Coolermaster that will be more
appropriate for extreme cooling like the
half X M alright so the front of the
case this is quite nice actually so
they've got an aluminum finish here two
USB 2.0 ports as well as a microphone
and headphone jack one USB 3 port reset
switch and power switch and then you've
got one five and a quarter inch bay
which will look quite nice with kind of
a black frame around it once you put a
black optical drive in there on the
bottom of the case you find some feet
and some black paint hey on the other
side of the case do you find some air
ventilation so that is kind of extreme
okay so you've got vents that run all
across both sides and the top of the
case and this one looks kind of cool
because it seems to have a bit of a
filter thing going on now this is how
they achieve the full ATX power supply
and compatibility I actually don't mind
this I built myself a mini ITR rather
micro ATX system and a silverstone sta-1
and in order to get a triple rad going
in that system I had to put both the
radiator and the fans and as kind of
like an external sort of protrusion out
of the case I had cut open the top of
the case and I put that there and I ran
the tubes down the back and then into
the case and I don't mind that sort of a
little bit of bulge thing in order to
achieve an overall cleaner tighter
tighter form factor so some people might
not like it I'm I'm a fan okay about
some more ventilation holes got your two
two expansion slots however this ITX
will only have one actual expansion card
you can fit Coolermaster seems to be
assuming that you're going to be using
that slot for a graphics card so these
are really tight I'm going to need to
grab my screwdriver and we're back and
while I was removing this
I noticed that the case has water
cooling holes where more specifically it
has one which means that if you actually
did have an external water cooling setup
you would be able to get the tube there
but not back or back but not there so
that's a very strange strange thing to
do but you know hey cooler master works
in mysterious ways and realistically you
don't really need water cooling for your
ITX
system anyway most ITX boards with the
exception of a Seuss's z77 board with
like the beefy huge pwm on it aren't
really capable of extreme overclocks
anyway so there we go we can have a
closer look at all the ventilation
that's going on in the in the enclosure
here and let's get the case open so what
do we have in terms of expandability so
we've got three three and a half inch
drive bays which we will have to try to
find there we are and are we missing a
sled hold on I'll be back yeah i derped
so these are two and a half inch
adapters for the three and a half inch
drive sleds that are attached to them so
you can natively mount there we go let's
show you guys how quick it is to mount a
hard drive in here although I actually
don't know which way they go so we're
just going to guess and we're going to
guess that the connectors go out the
back look there it is - this will go
back in there because that's where it
belongs back it's like that happy
gilmore scene it's your home - good for
your home let's go in the hole with the
ball okay anyway um so we'll put that in
there and that is how you mount hard
drives in the Elite 120 advanced
alternately you can use these adapters
then to mount two and a half inch drive
so it natively supports three three and
a half inch or up to four two and a half
inch dress so two of those drives are
with these adapters here and two of them
are somewhere else and we are going to
go on a voyage of discovery to find out
where those other two and a half inch
hard drives go and we're going to do
that voyage of discovery off camera
because I
really can't tell and it was actually
slick who figured this out which just
boggles my mind
so you actually mount one two and a half
inch drive up here then you flip it over
and you screw in another tune a half
inch drive from the bottom so using
these two adapters you can screw for two
and a half inch drives into here and
then I guess potentially you could do
another you could do another three and a
half inch that's cool that's it that's
actually outstanding and then the five
and a quarter inch drive is pretty
self-explanatory so there's just a bay
here and then you screw it in from
either time none of that fancy coolest
stuff I mean this is a fairly
inexpensive case considering all the
cooling that you got going on here and
all the features that has included so
let's have a look at cooling since they
talked so much about the extreme cool so
there's one 120-millimeter fan at the
front and this gets air from who knows
where oh yeah there we go
gets air from these vents here here and
here okay blows air through the drive
cages then you can mount an additional
when I'm doing 20 millimeter fan here on
the other side of this assuming you
don't have any components on your
motherboard that are going to that are
going to interfere with that in any way
then you can have an additional 80
millimeter fan right here blowing right
across the pwm on your motherboard as
well as the CPU socket area so that is
an incredibly smart placement for that
and finally you'll have your power
supply fan built-in so you'll have up to
4 fans in the system that are actually
actively working on exhaust and and
intake all your cables inside are black
love to see this they've also got all
the power plugs are black right up to
the connectors so it looks really really
really sharp you've got adapters for
these fans as well so you can put them
into three pin connectors there you go
doctor or you can use the molex
pass-through internal USB 3 which is
good to see again especially on a more
budget oriented case HD audio USB 2 and
I think that pretty much covered until
this I know guys I've been promising my
builds in the prodigy and the FTO 3 mini
for a while but this is going to be part
of our roundup because the FTO 3 is our
super small one and I'd love to see how
that one does in terms of cooling and
performance
the BitFenix prodigy is sort of like a
big mini ITX case so the cooling should
be great but it's kind of big you know
it's not that like ITX not that small
and then this is going to be like our
more traditional ITX case like our
compromise one and it's looking like
it's going to be really really strong
contender just based on the cooling
options that it has in terms of
including accessories you got some zip
ties you got some screws and you got one
more set of those drive rails so you'll
have enough because two of them came pre
mounted on these adapters thank you for
