the WD my book elite so we're gonna try
and follow there are three easy steps
now I've taken the liberty of plugging
in the power cord under the table
already so that I don't have to do that
on camera but we're gonna plug the power
supply into the back of the unit
right about here DC in and then the next
thing we're gonna do I saw some lights
go on inside the next thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna plug in the USB cable
here which I've already plugged into the
back of my test bed PC okay and then I'm
going to press the power button
everybody hold your breath
okay the activity LED is going haha here
we go
so on the screen now I have two two
menus I have one autoplay for the
virtual CD drive smart where yes I would
like to allow the computer to run that
so here we go
backup files or setup drive which would
you like to do oh cool look at this you
just mouse over and it shows different
stuff that's kind of neat little
animations to help you figure out what
everything is okay fine I set a setup
drive okay so you can backup your file
security data automatically check for ok
yeah let's install that accept ok and
then the other menu that came up was
just to access the data on the drive
itself where obviously there's no
there's no wizards involved or anything
you just copy-paste and that's your one
terabyte of storage so actually let me
see what it says so it is 930 gigs once
it's formatted ok so here the smart ware
was successfully installed let's
continue to setup ok label let's put a
label on this ok here actually here
cameraman look at this ok so the drive
came like this which looks as far as I
can tell like a pute like a piece of
paper but you can see it is changing now
so the way the display works it actually
doesn't seem to need any power it's like
a Inc or something
so let's set a label of Linus is cool
and let's see if it'll do that ok save
label name oh ok
yes Linus is cool ok awesome and then I
can set a password the password should
be Linus
and then the verify is - camera man's
totally in my way here
and then the camp is me I understand
save the security settings okay I don't
want to register the drive so continue
okay there we go so now we have the the
software setup here's our little visual
indicator that shows nothing oh cool so
this shows my C Drive and it shows me
how much is pictures how much is other
music movies documents and system and
then how much is free and then this is
my book and so the additional files
would be the built-in software so that
we didn't have to use a driver CD and
then as soon as we start to fill it up
with with photos and stuff so why don't
we try dragging a couple over there
I guess this should populate maybe it
takes a little while though so give it
some time so back up you can actually
run the backup at any time and then
retrieve so you can retrieve a backup
here are your backup volumes that's
pretty cool this has gotten a lot better
since the last time I used one of these
drives I'll tell you that much ok so
that was pretty much it thank you for
checking out our little set-up guide on
the my book elite and don't forget - is
cool and he has 930 gigabytes free and
the drive is secure cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
