delivers the convenience of an
all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more the last time Intel made their own
consumer grade SSD top to bottom
including the controller firmware and
NAND flash was back in 2008 yes the era
of the x.25 m and its defendants that
architecture was with us for almost two
and a half years of product refreshes
including a move to haylage and free
manufacturing changes to the
accompanying Ram cache and upgraded
firmwares with encryption and trim
support but until never dramatically
updated the controller itself leaving it
struggling along at the end of its
lifecycle as a SATA 2 product amidst a
sea of SATA 3 competitors average return
okay but why so emotional Linus there
are tons of good SSD options on the
market well Intel SSDs have always been
I'm holding this backwards on the
expensive side for their performance but
their reliability is legendary aside
from being aware of the reputation
they've built with their other products
and their competitive warranty periods
I've also had the pleasure of touring
their Folsom campus where much of the
SSD work is done and let me tell you
when intel says validation they mean it
they had SSDs that were many months from
release being torture tested using
equipment that smaller SSD manufacturers
at the time that I talked to hadn't even
seen before so while I don't actually
use an intel SSD in my own desktop PC I
do use one in my home server and I do
use one in my wife's PC because let me
tell you guys and the married ones of
you can probably relate to this when it
comes to your own you know boot drive
dying it sucks but you're probably
prepared when your wife's drive dies and
she loses all her junk because she
wasn't using the bleeping Nass like you
told her to she will find a way to make
it your fault and it really sucks and
that is what keeps me excited about this
drive reliability because frankly the
performance is not earth-shattering at
PAX Prime 2013 Intel was hinting at a
user overclockable SSD with unheard-of
performance and at the time I said
that's insane I hope they just tuned the
hardware to bring a competitive
performance oriented drive to market but
don't compromise data integrity and
Intel predictable to a fault did just
that a non text review which I'll link
in the video description for your
convenience covers the basis pretty well
as far as performance goes the quick
summary though is this the drive builds
on the same DNA as the s 3500 and s 3700
which are both enterprise products and
while peak performance isn't at the top
of the charts the 730 s ability to
consistently perform its best even when
it's full or being hit with a lot of
data over an extended period of time
is top notch the extended summary
is a bit more complicated and includes a
longer series of consumer versus
enterprise trade-offs first up intel is
using the same controller and mlc h ET
for both uses and is using the same
combination of die screening and an
increase in the drives page programming
cycle to achieve up to six times better
endurance than regular NLC meant that's
where the five-year warranty comes from
but for the consumer version they are
also aggressively ramping up the clock
speed of the controller by 50% and they
increased the interface speed on the
NAND flash as well next up we get robust
power loss protection with a pair of
capacitors that will allow the one gig
of ram cache to dump its data to the
flash but we are sacrificing full drive
encryption and the normally low power
that SSDs consume to the PC hardware
gods
so the 730 will keep your data safe as
long as no one physically steals it
which they probably won't since you
won't be putting this drive in a laptop
it actually consumes more power than a
one terabyte tuned a half inch notebook
hard drive and finally the drive
delivers excellent write performance
more important in an enterprise or
workstation environment but legs behind
in reads which are unfortunately more
common in a consumers daily life so I
guess the conclusion for this drive is
this all those trade-offs are either
making you groan and wonder why Intel
even bothered putting a super-duper
skull graphic and speed demon sticker on
this thing or those trade-offs are
making you super excited because like me
you still have a handful of first gen
x.25 ms deployed out there that are all
humming along and it's more about the
long-term viability of a product to you
than the day one performance anyway guys
