motherboard unboxing this is from MSI
gaming line of motherboards you can tell
because it has a big red G on it wow I
actually just realized as I was saying
that that this is a G I knew about the
color coding but I had no I see look
it's the same stylized G for gaming
series this is a micro ATX motherboard
built on AMD's 890 GX chipset so it uses
one of the latest chipsets from AMD
it is a g65 suffix so the M means micro
ATX g65 denotes fairly high-end probably
about as high-end as you're gonna go on
em ATX okay we've got a few logos on the
front so why don't we have a look here
it's HDMI so it has HDMI out excellent
thank you it has security by Norton okay
EU p msi ready some kind of green thing
they've done that it's a tree then we
have autumn overclocking OC Genie this
is actually a pretty cool feature I had
this I covered this in my core i5
overclocking guide then we have six SATA
6 gigabits per second or SATA 3 as well
as USB 3.0 let's go around to the back
it has a heat pipe and it supports
lossless audio ok let's open this thing
up so accessories it a Massiah does a
pretty good job as far as their
accessory packages go but this is a
micro ATX board so you expect to find a
little bit less first we've got an i/o
seal so we can already see basically
what we're gonna have on the back of the
board but I'm not gonna give away any
surprises now then we have a drivers and
utilities DVD don't use it download the
latest off the MSI website the quick
installation guide is about three feet
wide and shows us all of the basics so
they show a CPU RAM Drive graphics card
front panel headers power BIOS OS and
driver installation so you could in
theory ohh camera man's trying to look
at this for some reason there you go ok
you could in theory setup your computer
with this Quick Start Guide so thank you
on the side for that and then if that
guide is not enough for you then there's
a full user's guide which is thick and
fuzzy French what else we got here
German Inge oh wow I don't know
Russian I think that's all not I'm not
sure and also English at the beginning
so it's a fairly thin manual actually
there's not a whole lot to it okay great
next we have IDE
one molex to SATA adapter and one SATA
cable this yeah yeah you're probably
gonna want more than one SATA cable with
a high end board like this I would have
liked to see a couple more included but
the reality of it is SATA cables don't
cost a whole lot and if you're anything
like me you've probably got a couple
hundred of them lying around anyway so
given that you don't need any kind of
special SATA cable four SATA 6 gigabits
per second I think it doesn't make much
of a difference how many they include
okay next we have the board itself so
first of all we have the power savings
so ApS active phase switching so the
unique power saving design for any OS
basically what they're doing is they're
switching how many phases of power the
CPU uses depending on the load of the
system and it will actually use less
power overall that way then if say they
had a sixteen phase CPU power delivery
design if you actually run all 16 phases
at all times it is going to hurt your
power consumption although it'll be
delivering very clean power so when
you're delivering less power you can
actually turn off some of the phases
okay so here why don't we start in the
middle of the board where all the action
is this is an am-3 socket so you have
support for all the latest AMD quad
cores and since this is an eight ninety
G X I would fully expect there to be
support for the upcoming AMD six core
CPUs next we've got a four pin power
connector up at the top left so you can
tell that they're not expecting to
deliver a whole ton of power to the CPU
so you're not gonna be doing any extreme
like liquid nitrogen overclocking on
this board but it's going to be more
than adequate
obviously for even the highest TDP CPUs
from AMD which is a hundred and forty
watt speaking of which this is cooling
your voltage regulation modules and then
you've got one small heat pipe going
down to the chipset so that's your eight
nine dgx chipset and then down here is
your South Bridge which is running did
did it did today I did it again
five SATA 6 gigabits per second ports so
something to note about this AMD board
versus any
teleport out there right now is that
you've got six SATA 6 gigabits per
second ports including your eSATA port
on the back and that is more than you'd
see on almost any Intel board because
they're actually running off the AMD
chipset rather than running off a
third-party chipset added by the
motherboard manufacturer so that's
pretty cool you've only got five here so
the sixth one is actually on the back
panel ddr3 so we have support for dual
channel ddr3 and they're color-coded so
you would install the modules
side-by-side so if you have two modules
you'd put them both in the blue and then
both in the black your 24 pin connectors
in its ideal location along the
right-hand edge of the board and let's
see what else we've got here for regular
or rather regular for interesting
features easy OC switch let me see what
kind of a switch they've implemented I
have never seen this particular switch
before so I would love to comment on how
it works but I actually don't know the
OC Genie switch I've seen before it's
just a push button but ya know it looks
like they've implemented a slightly
different system this time around so
yeah you just switch it back and forth
like that oh I hope I can put those back
yeah there we go okay so you've got USB
headers for so you could hook up like
four front USB ports a card reader some
other thing oh here we go hey hey hey
here's the manual huh easy OC switch
it's right there on the motherboard so
default is both up so for a 10%
overclock you push down switch number 2
for a 15% overclock you push down switch
number 1 and then for a 20% overclock
you push down both switches there you go
that's your easy OC switch so let's put
those back to no overclock ok expansion
cards so you can put in 2 PCI Express
16x graphics cards 1 PCI Express One X
and one PCI now I would have liked to
see these two switched around because if
you're buying a relatively high end
although micro-atx in there by lower end
board you'd probably want to be using a
dual slot video card and if you're doing
that then you'd probably want to have an
additional PCIe slot that said what they
have done with this particular layout is
they've given you a way to install one
graphics card one PCIe
other card so if you're not using two
graphics cards and then one PCI so it
seems like kind of a flexible layout and
you're there's always compromises that
you have to make on a micro ATX board as
far as expansion slots are concerned
because there's only four let's have a
look at the back of the board so we've
got one of those mouse keyboard ps2
combo ports we have optical audio out
then we have DVI VGA and HDMI then we
have four USB 2.0 ports one HDMI one
eSATA running at six gigabit per second
then we have two USB 3.0 ports those are
running at about ten times the speed of
the USB 2.0 ports one Gigabit Ethernet
and then 7.1 onboard analog audio thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
890 G xmg 65 from MSI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
