to learn more welcome to my unboxing an
overview of some cool stuff we got from
mini suit comm so you can check them out
in the video description basically we
needed some cases because I don't know
if you guys follow me on Twitter or not
but this is a case for the HTC one which
I desperately need I recently dropped it
again and scratched it pretty good so it
comes with a little pink like bullet
which probably has some sort of utility
there's a rubber thing on the top here
that I'm sure does something but I'm not
gonna worry too much about that anyway
it also comes with a screen protector as
well as a microfiber cloth for cleaning
off the screen before you apply it and
it comes with the case itself so I'm not
going to worry too much about the screen
protector because I use liquid armor but
other than that there we go
my one is now more protected and it
looks a little something like that
pretty snug fit actually it's not bad
and it's obviously not gonna protect it
from any kind of like you know 20 foot
Falls or anything like that but still
gives you easy access to the port's you
need as well as see it doesn't restrict
being able to plug anything into the
three and a half mil as well as the
volume control and there you go nice and
low-profile one of the things I don't
like about cases is that a lot of the
time they're very bulky and you know you
buy this slim phone and then you put a
huge case on it it's like what was the
point of that so it's got a bit of a
soft touch grippy feel to the back of it
this was the one I picked
slick picked a different case for a his
Galaxy s3 so he picked their case for
samsung galaxy s3s 393 so this one right
here is like a more professional style
looking case so you clip the s3 in here
it's got a spot for your flash as well
as your camera and I don't know it's
probably a speaker or something
can't remember I've never actually done
an overview of the s3 in any way so this
goes in like this it's got a little
hinge right here and then closes over
the s3 just like that little got a
little mini suit logo on it does out a
little bit more bulk than mine so you
can see mine's a lot slimmer
but includes a protective screen cover
and gives you the option to set up your
phone like that if you want to view it
and I think yeah there's just one angle
there for that so there you go that was
the one slick picked and then I actually
don't have my wife's phone on me but she
picked one that was very similar to mine
anyway for her Droid DNA so this one's
very similar to the one except instead
of a hard plastic case it's more of a
rubberized case so same thing mini suit
branding and that's pretty much it
without having the phone there to show
you that one I don't really have too
many options other things that I picked
up are the design craft angry Mon
smartphone analog woofer and cradle so
there's a few different ways you can put
your phone in it so number one is woofer
mode so the idea is that your speaker
depending on where it's positioned would
be somehow enhanced by putting it in
like this number two is cradle so this
will allow you to have it sit there and
sort of notify you if anything comes up
and last but not least you can use it
for storage so they've got the idea
being here that you can throw like a
thumbtack and a paperclip inside and
that will be handy so basically I
grabbed one of these so that I'd have
something that I could put products on
to show them off as well as something to
sort of chuck my phone on so that I can
see notifications when they're incoming
and that is pretty much it for that
pretty straightforward so the bottom has
little rubberized feet on it it has
actually got kind of a silicon e type
build to it so it's quite flexible and
there you have it that's pretty much it
for that one and then this one this is
the one that I think is actually
probably the coolest thing this is the
my Vizu or me Vizu or whatever you want
to call it an IV i zdu universal car
mount system compatible cradle for all
types of handheld devices between four
to nine centimeters in width such as
mobile phones smart phones PDAs mini gps
and mp3 mp4 devices so this guy right
here is a universal mount for your car
and I've run into the challenge lately
of wanting to use my phone for GPS and
having it be illegal to hold it because
I live in BC and the law has recently
been changed so you're not really
allowed to touch it so you have to find
a way to mount it without doing that so
something like this
looks like the solution we're gonna go
ahead and mount this we'll be back in a
moment it is so friggin hot in this car
so we're gonna try and do this pretty
quickly we're gonna start with the air
vent mount so this one right here goes
basically like that you attach it to it
looked like it worked best to me when
you hook it on to the top vent there you
go that secures into place and then this
bottom one can be used to adjust the
angle so you kind of put that wherever
you want it to go and then you take the
the cradle here and you just press these
two buttons this is kind of cute I like
this that's all space-age and junk
anyway I know I know they all work like
this anyway so there's rubber pieces
here that hold the phone into place so
they've got a bit of a of a lipped shape
to them do that and so that it shouldn't
slip out once it's actually secured into
place there then you just take that and
put it on there alright so that my
friends is the universal air vent one
which has the added benefit of cooling
your phone when it oh my goodness I'm
like sweating here when it's hot like
this all right so the next one here is
adjustable in a number of different ways
so you can undo this guy right here spin
this around so that this can point in
any direction you want then you can also
twist it in any direction you want
secure it where exactly you want it to
be then all you got to do is take this
yeah okay so the reliefs open it up like
that and you can stick that oh I don't
know to your dash or to your window so
say for example if you wanted to keep a
phone in the very top sort of right-hand
corner of your windshield then you could
I just this guy right here just this guy
right here lock her into place this is
now secured and then you can use that to
release it then you just pull that off
there put that on there there we go
and then from there actually probably I
wouldn't use this mount to mount it
vertically I'd probably use it to mount
it horizontally it helps if you turn it
around the right way there we go
and then you could use it for your DPS
or whatever else you want to use it for
so it slipped into place
doesn't move oh let's see if my bike
gets hit here we go here we go dash cam
dash cam dash cam nope so here's a
lioness how to get a traffic violation
ticket instantly tip there you go that's
how you actually a fix it two things so
you can see that's actually on there
pretty good on the windscreen of my bike
the bike itself is actually moving
pretty good and that saw that hasn't
come off yet so then we can take our our
joint right here and that we'd have to
be smoking if we were actually going to
attach a phone to the front of our bike
like this and there you have it so in
theory which I do not recommend doing
because in addition to getting a ticket
it also particularly if you're in a
riding posture down here kind of pretty
much destroys any any visibility that
you might have had in front of yourself
which is the direction that motorbikes
move yeah in theory this this could work
but please don't do this I just wanted
to find out if it would even mount to
the because it's quite a curved screen
here but you can see it's quite securely
mounted there we go don't forget to
