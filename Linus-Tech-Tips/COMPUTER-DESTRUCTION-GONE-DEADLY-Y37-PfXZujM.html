designed to strike fear in the minds of
defenseless non techie masses but unlike
the creatively named rubber ducky or the
hacksaw and switchblade USB methods
thoroughly documented as part of an
hour-long 240p epic by hack 5 back in
2006 the USB killer is literal it's a
USB device that will kill what you plug
into it
now the original USB killer applied a
negative charge of 120 volts to the 5
volt V USB pin on the port effectively
destroying the USB controller and its
power regulation circuitry USB killer 2
kicks it up a notch bumping up the
negative voltage to around 200 volts and
it hits it directly in the data pins
chances are any device that you plug it
into will no longer be functioning
properly some may survive but the
majority won't and terrifyingly enough
this isn't just limited to laptops and
desktop computers it even works on
phones TVs and cars if you can plug a
USB device into it it may be vulnerable
to this attack so this is the part where
I demo it right truthfully I had my
reservations about actually killing a
bunch of hardware I mean it's been done
many times before but this is Linus tech
tips Linus is the man that bought a
$17,000 UPS Linus is the man that
decided that he needed a 180 terabyte
server just so that we'd never have to
delete a single file all in the name of
excess so maybe it would be appropriate
to kill his recently finished desk PC
project that you guys waited so long to
see completed so follow me and let's do
just that
dad
oh my I didn't actually think that's
gonna work okay I'm gonna get fired
math shop is currently featuring the EMU
Purpleheart closed back headphones check
this and other drops out in the link
below okay so as you probably guessed
just like all the other YouTube pranks
that was faked
I didn't get fired the computer is fine
the flash drive I plugged it into is
completely harmless I just flipped the
switch on the power bar with my foot as
I put it in but the attack is real and
the drive I have here now actually in
there is the real thing
USB killer's official YouTube channel
has plenty of videos showing it killing
things like Xboxes and even a car and if
you won't take their word for it our
buddy Austin Evans apps to different
laptops a TV and even a phone but how
does it work well it actually uses your
own device against you when you plug
your USB killer into a device it cycles
through rapidly charging its own
capacitors off of the device and then
discharging them at the previously
mentioned negative more specifically
about 220 volts a heck of a lot more
than both the 5 volts USB is designed
for and the 15 volts that would already
have been enough to kill most devices
this cycle is repeated many times per
second until the USB killer is removed
and you can reuse it as many times as
you want that is until a teacher
confiscates it and calls your parents do
you need to buy one then well people
have actually been making their own by
modifying random USB devices that
actually work for it or even taking the
flash circuitry out of a disposable
camera and reworking it to load up the
capacitor and discharge over USB it's
not even that complicated you salvaged
the transistor transformer resistor
diode and capacitor from the camera at a
power source if the cameras isn't
suitable throw a button in for ease of
use and then send it all over USB and
you're done and so is the device does
this crude method work yeah and you
don't even need the host device to
charge it to test it we grabbed an old
Acer Aspire one from 2008 that Linus had
in the e-waste pile for recycling now
everything in the computer isn't
magically dead hi
trust the motherboard or the CPU anymore
but the rest should honestly pretty much
be fine when throwing that much voltage
around I'm not going to guarantee
anything but this isn't a data
destruction method and the hard drive in
here almost certainly still works
okay so enough about how easy it is for
people to brick your stuff how do you
protect yourself well the US government
suggests not plugging things into your
computer thanks guys outside of that you
probably can't physically kaping USB
ports adding so-called USB condoms or
installing the USB killer test shield
have been cited as ways to defend
against this but as long as the attacker
has enough ingenuity to unplug whatever
you plugged in they will be able to
quickly bypass your protection
unfortunately outside of filling all
your USB ports with cement if anyone has
direct access to your computer that is
vulnerable to this type of attack and
there enough of a dick to actually do it
you're screwed USB type-c will sort of
have a solution to this which is a new
cryptographic authentication that can
stop unauthorized and uncertified
devices from connecting but as with
pretty much all things done this way
there will almost assuredly be a way to
bypass it the best way to protect
against this attack is to have the
manufacturer of your device install an
opto coupler these are also known as
photo couplers or optical Isolators
they're components that transfer
electrical signals between two isolated
circuits by using light effectively
preventing high voltages from reaching
the entire system even if the port loses
its ability to transmit and receive data
this is better than nothing
but not many companies have even
implemented these outside of Apple so be
sure to hit up your favorite device
manufacturer and tell them to get a
Kraken in conclusion just as we've
always said don't plug random USB
devices into things if you don't trust
it just throw it away and know this
isn't a meme or a hoax you shouldn't try
this on your friends computer because
it's illegal and honestly it's just not
even funny you're just killing hardware
