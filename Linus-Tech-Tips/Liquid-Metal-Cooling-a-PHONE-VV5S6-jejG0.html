know first yeah deal it'd your CPU and
then that high wears off so then you
like liquid metal your laptop and again
you're rewarded with amazing temps and
even a performance boost and that keeps
you going for another week or so and
then you notice something getting kind
of hot in your pants
you know the idea it starts small but
then it grows grows getting more and
more solid what if you could make your
phone run cooler and faster with liquid
metal well guess what that's a super
risky maybe even bad idea so we're gonna
show you how to do it after we tell you
today's video is brought to you by shade
tree sunglasses shade tree sunglasses
are hand made from hard wood materials
featuring polarized lenses a variety of
designs and even cool new carbon frames
get 10% off your next order through our
link below
so it is common for phone performance to
nosedive during any workload that takes
more than a couple of seconds with
gaming being a common culprit so your
processor starts out cool and fast then
the hotter it gets the more it thermal
throttles so liquid metal likely
wouldn't do anything for that initial
cold performance but it could allow us
to maintain peak performance for longer
so we chose the razor phone as our
victim excuse me a test subject compared
to most phones its thermal design is
very respectable but it is still not
perfect check this out
our first 3d mark result puts us in the
top 83 percent of razor phones so that
looks pretty good but then a second run
immediately afterwards gave much worse
results and it dropped all the way down
to 20% worse after a 15 minute stress
test that is the kind of performance
impact that you would notice in an
extended mobile gaming session so let's
get started then you'll need a good set
of screwdrivers and prying tools some
isopropyl alcohol some paper towel some
conformal coating cotton swabs and a
heat gun because getting inside phones
sucks and of course you'll also need
liquid metal will be using thermal
grisly conduct anat now your phone's
disassembly process will be different
unless you have a razor phone but we'd
recommend watching this whole process
anyway without skipping around if you
plan to follow along so first we made
sure the device was off then we took a
heat gun to the speaker grills with the
adhesive softened we peeled them off
with a prying tool next we removed this
combination of regular Phillips and Torx
screws we recommend always placing
things like this in a parts tray in the
same position as they came out of the
phone in so you don't have to guess
which ones go where during reassembly
then we used guitar picks to keep the
phone from snapping back together while
we pried it apart until well it pried
apart and the screen popped off then
once we got inside and took off the
cables for the LCD screen and battery
giving us our first good look at the
razor phone's heat pipe cooler it's
insulated from the battery and actually
seems to be designed to use the screen
to increase its surface area for heat
dissipation pretty cool with the stock
thermal paste removed it wasn't entirely
clear actually how to proceed we lifted
this small copper heat spreader very
carefully with a razor blade not to be
confused with a razor blade and then had
a planning session so if liquid metal
gets on anything aluminium the gallium
in it will destroy it with corrosion so
what we've decided is to put the best
thermal compound that we have between
the copper sheet and the processor and
then liquid metal the heat pipe to the
copper heat spreader with regular
thermal compound all around it time then
to execute we applied conformal coating
around the CPU with a cotton swab to act
as a line of defense if the liquid metal
spills off the CPU then to put our
copper heat spreader back on we used
arctic silver thermal adhesive which you
mix up in equal parts and then spread
across the surfaces that you want to
stick together just like an epoxy we
then cleaned the copper spreader and
carefully placed it back on removing any
wrinkles with a guitar pick and clamping
it all together for about 20 minutes to
make sure that it was set moving over to
the back of the screen we applied a
generous amount of thermal paste here
and then it was finally time for liquid
metal we put a small drop in a cleaned
parts tray then picked up a tiny bit
with a cotton swab this was carefully
spread out over the copper heat pipe you
only need a little bit of this stuff to
do the trick
time for reassembly if you are
performing this mod on a razor phone by
the way I would strongly recommend that
you get new speaker grilles first
because they don't just stick back on so
we used what we fondly refer to as that
sticky tar crap to put them back on as
best we could
I give it a 4 out of 10 anyway hitting
the power button it boots so now it's
time for the payoff or lack thereof we
weren't sure given that we weren't
liquid metals all the way to the chip
itself if this was even really gonna
work so in 3d mark
we immediately recorded our highest
result yet but not by a very significant
margin cautious optimism that best at
this point then on the second run whoa
no decrease in performance whatsoever
also in the Vulcan test which comes
after the OpenGL one is finished running
we went from very middle-of-the-road
performance compared to other razer
phones to being in the top 4% and our
other benchmarks saw modest gains and
performance - so this phone right here
it's got ugly grills but you could game
on it indefinitely and see virtually no
drop in performance an A+ result so then
would we recommend performing this
operation the answer is no given the low
mounting pressure for the cooler and the
way that phones get moved and tossed
around all the time we believe that the
chances of the liquid metal shifting and
damaging the aluminum inside your phone
or even shorting something out and
bricking it entirely are too high
also we can't know how much of the
performance increase came from the
liquid metal and how much was simply
from repai stting the phone with a
higher quality thermal interface
material so bottom line then unless
you're going for bone performance
records it's really cool and the results
surprised even us but I wouldn't
recommend voiding your warranty over it
speaking of things I would recommend
ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction when you call ting you
don't speak to robot you get put through
directly to a person and you don't pay
extra for the privilege the average ting
bill is just 23 bucks a month per device
and if you're stuck in a contract and
switch to ting they'll cover 25
percent of your cancellation fee up to
75 bucks the cool thing about ting is
that you only pay for exactly the
airtime and data that you use and data
is now just ten bucks a gig beyond the
first gig so try out their savings
calculator it's over at Linus ENCOM
we'll have that link below and find out
if you would save money on ting when you
sign up at our link you'll get twenty
five bucks in service credit or towards
a new device so thanks for watching guys
if this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button or check out the link
to where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also link down
there's our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join no
one no one's to know this was Linus and
we'd have made it in the video but
fortunately my uncle and it's generally
goes under the radar you actually think
that the editors are going to take the
time to go through all this footage and
listen to it I really strongly doubt it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
