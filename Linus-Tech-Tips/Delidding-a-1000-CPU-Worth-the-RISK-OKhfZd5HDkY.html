of removing the heat spreader from a CPU
we decided that it wasn't really worth
the effort the voided warranty on a
brand new $300 processor or the risk but
it has since come to our attention that
while exacto knives are uh
fun if a little dangerous tool for
deleting there is a much better way to
go about it so then with the der Bauer D
living tools in hand for both LGA 1151
and 2066
that's right my friends we're gonna get
naked with a core i9 we are going to
reevaluate deleting should you do it
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description now both of
Intel's current platforms are notorious
for running pretty with many enthusiasts
pointing to Intel's use of a paste
rather than solder based thermal
interface material between the heat
producing die and the protective heat
spreader overtop of it so let's take a
look at our tools this guy right here is
the it's gonna be such comment fodder
okay so this is the der bauer d lid mate
to the tool itself actually pretty
straightforward it's two metal pieces
here and a hex wrench
so the CPU sits in the grooves here with
the arrow pointing did you deal with
this already yes
the IHS isn't on right it's a it's 90
degrees huh okay well you know what
that's okay because this is a good
opportunity to show you guys how it
works so I'm gonna deal it it again so
we can put it back on properly pretty
much you slide this second piece in here
you tighten up this screw as much as you
can by hand you throw in the hex wrench
and bippity-boppity-boo that's all there
is to it the hex screw pulls against the
IHS with mechanical force causing its
silicone seal to break and you have got
yourself a deal it into CPU then we just
need to scrape off the silicon clean
that baby up at home look how shiny it
is okay now you could technically run a
CPU like this with the cooler straight
on the die but with modern Intel
processors it's impractical for a couple
of reasons
not the least of which is that in order
to get good contact between your cooler
and the CPU you have to remove the
retention mechanism meaning there's no
easy way to keep the CPU in the socket
etc etc etc so what most people are
doing is they're taking their deleted
processor they're using a higher quality
thermal compound so we'll be using
thermal grizzly also provided by Drew
Bower and they're pretty much gluing
that sucker back together so we're just
gonna take some pretty generic silicon
junk here that we pulled out of a tube
in our caulking gun we put it in a
syringe and we're just gonna kind of
yeah I'm not doing a very nice job of
this but whatever you guys get the point
okay so that's on there we take just a
little bit of thermal compound then we
take our CPU we put it back in the D
living tool aligning the triangle with
the triangle not triangle with the dot
and we take our IHS and we put that on
aligning the dot with the dot
bippity Boppity it close-ish alright
then to make sure that our IHS is
aligned correctly we Jen this baby in
here and you take the included little
Turney screwy grippy doodad here you
tighten this baby down right on the
center there we go
and then leave it for about half an hour
to harden back on anyway though deleting
the 7700 K that's been done to death
that's the boring one good thing Anthony
already has the performance numbers that
demonstrate that as long as you're
willing to give up your warranty this
safer way of deleting is a fantastic way
to significantly drop your cpu
temperatures which is obviously a good
thing
wait how did you get performance numbers
on this if the IHS was on the wrong way
you know what forget it I don't even
want to know because the main event
today is the prototype derp our ad
emitting tool for X $2.99 this one works
a little differently using the force
from this lever right here to push the
IHS but the whole thing is still powered
by a hex screw with one of these
included allen wrenches so we're gonna
be deleting the core I 970 900 X because
we like to live dangerously get on in
here Dennis come on get a look at this
so we put the CPU in aligning the
triangle right there with the triangle
right there so that's all pretty
straightforward so far it sits in there
nice and snug
alright then in theory and I haven't
read the instructions we just do this
one do this thing
look at how like over the thing is so
German you'll turn these thing and then
it pushes this thing which in turn
pushes this thing like so
over-engineered I love everything about
it
okay it's getting tight now I'm getting
tense
oh it's getting really tight now okay oh
man that's a lot of pressure she's
legitimately getting really hard to push
oh okay this is this is tense oh my
goodness I think it's off okay I think
it's off okay thousand dollar processor
kids ladies and gentlemen thousand
dollar chip
Oh oh wow oh there it goes holy crap
look at the way that thing is assembled
it's got silicone sealant up the butt
okay who obey hopefully this thing still
works oh I need my alcohol this kind so
same basic procedure let's clean her up
shiny baby shy now
apply our silicone again apply our
thermal grizzly again this time using
the handy dandy applicator end trying to
oh oh lordy
oh lordy oh this is bad oh that's way
too much thermal compound that's awful
this is awful okay that's it
I'm never gonna be a professional
thermal compound up liar oh really
this time get this its dot - triangle so
we go ahead and put that baby on there
we do not have an alignment tool this
time so we're just gonna have to Yolo it
then we throw the whole thing back in
the deal inning tool and we clamp her
down that's right
give her the clamps baby it should be
fine everything's fine moment of truth
time my friends let's get this installed
in the socket here so again triangle the
triangle hopefully that orientation
works just fine for us here cooler time
here we'll just be using icy diamond
let's throw this baby on here my thumb
screws be at beaches is it gonna post or
what it just posted okay so the CPU
still works that's good so now all we
got to do is throw our overclock profile
on
and then we can do some tempura zones
for you guys what just happened
well that's not good this is better than
it was really yeah it was 105 Oh No
okay yes it's hitting that again but not
the immediately like it did before
okay so we just need to wait 10 minutes
for our final result here so here we are
and we can actually kind of wrap things
up here our core i7 managed a 17 degree
Delta at 4.8 gigahertz allowing it to
run at that speed for half an hour for a
stress test with no throttling
whatsoever cool as for our core i9 well
it looks like our overclock wasn't 100%
stable our system actually crashed but
the good news is that while we were
still running at super high temperatures
come on in here
we actually thermal throttled less than
we did for our first run-through before
deal inning okay so it's actually a few
days later and what we saw with our
overclocked result turned out to
surprisingly be a result of the better
cooling performance even though the
temperatures weren't that different so
if we look at the graphs our Intel Timm
overclocked test was tripping thermal
protection despite a very modest voltage
bump of only 10 millivolts so you can
actually see it as it drops in the CPU
load that's reported in task manager and
also in the reported temps with thermal
grizzly conductor not it actually
stabilized and then that was what
revealed that our overclocked frequency
wasn't stable so since we can't put a
number on that type of improvement what
we'll do is revert to comparing our
stock cooling performance and wouldn't
you know it we actually got 20 degrees
lower on the maximum reported
temperatures after deleting 20 degrees
so it's crystal clear then that Intel
stock Tim is basically toothpaste by
comparison but
should you void the warranty on your
brand-new thousand dollar CPU well given
that this tool isn't even out yet to say
nothing of the mass of the silicon
adhesive that's a solid no I think for
most people but if you're looking to
squeeze every last bit of performance
out of your new workstation and you
don't mind the risks involved well there
are definitely gains to be had
