Dana Caravan ARIMA Sam Chema's hi
brilliant oh they already put it on
gmail over so that's pretty much how we
imagined this product came to be yes it
is in fact a real thing the key the key
Mouse and it really works exactly the
way that you would think it does
hey James remember how I said that I was
really excited to try this out and learn
to use it and tell our audience about it
yeah yeah I'm not and a-one and a-two
anda have fun
the mas backpack is back in stock
utilizing a removable sunglass pouch
longer straps for larger shoulders
available power management to help
charge your gear and backed with a
five-year warranty it's pretty sick
check it out at the link below if you've
been following our escapades with weird
or organ ama keyboards then you'll
recognize some familiar features when
you look at the key Mouse alpha for
starters it's a split keyboard with each
side having a contoured integrated wrist
rest and this of course lets you spread
your hands out as wide as your shoulders
which is dank if you got y-dash
shoulders and optimizes the position of
your wrist to prevent the three amigos
the three main causes of repetitive
stress injuries which are all are
deviation which is in your wrist go like
this is no good extension and pronation
which is when your hand is laying flat
on the keyboard this kind of handles all
three next it has these thumb clusters
which I personally after having switched
the ergo docks over like a year and a
half ago cannot live without now it just
doesn't make any sense to use one of
your strongest digits only on the
spacebar so key Mouse has four keys with
Cherry MX switches blue in this case
brown on this one accessible by each
thumb then there's the layout which is
similar to the one on the Kinesis
advantage to another great keyboard
first it's ortho linear which means that
the keys are aligned instead of
staggered which is a real pain if you're
not used to using your middle finger to
hit C like a good little typist but I
got used to it eventually and it feels
good now second the keys are in these
concave key wells they're not as deep as
on the advantage too
but it still keeps your finger
surrounding to stretch as far as they
normally would on a traditional flat
QWERTY and finally there's only about 60
keys in total which is obviously a lot
less than your typical 104 key layout so
you're gonna have to get used to
switching between function layers using
these little blue and yellow keys kind
of a drag now some secondary functions
like the arrow keys and the numpad are
actually pretty easy to use once you get
used to switching layers because you can
rely on the muscle memory that you all
right
have to hit them but other things you'll
have to learn from scratch like since
when our parentheses over here and why
is caps lock on a secondary layer and
while I'm at it where are all the number
keys all of those special characters
have moved which can be really annoying
when you're trying to use your password
muscle memory surely they could have
included the number oh no well maybe not
yes they could technically do it but
that would come with the trade-off of
adding more weight which is yucky
because remember each one of these is a
mouse it's actually comical how bad I am
with the left Mouse
especially since I'm left-handed but
this is actually pretty cool because for
the first time in my life I can move the
mouse around without taking my fingers
off the home row and if you're the type
to get a strained neck or shoulder then
this is a godsend because you no longer
have to reach way out for your mouse yes
it does take some getting used to
don't worry you still only have one
cursor on the screen but each module is
a fully functioning Mouse with its own
optical sensor its own left and right
clicks and its own mouse scroll wheel
that you can even click so you're free
to use whichever Mouse you want to and
switch between them at will you can even
use one on the far right side of your
multi monitor setup and then kind of
hand off the cursor to the left when you
get on that far side of your super ultra
wide display like I have but you can't
like move them together to try to double
your movement speed or anything crazy
like that because Windows only accepts
really one input at a time there are a
couple of extras though you can hold
this sniper type button to temporarily
drop your sensitivity for finer control
and since you can't easily pick up the
mouse when you get to the edge of your
mouse pad or an uncomfortable position
this special little snowflake button
pauses Mouse movement so that you can
get your hands back in place without
moving the pointer as for how well it
works
as a mouse though the thing that was
weird for me especially at first was
that with a regular Mouse there's a
certain intuitiveness to point around at
things on your desktop as if the cursor
is an extension of your index finger by
comparison the key Mouse felt more like
fisting
and squeezing because the mouse click is
accessible like a thumb one solution I
had to make it feel more natural was to
put the clicks up here instead of on the
side at least then first time users
wouldn't find themselves accidentally
smashing the J key all the time like I
did but apparently earlier versions of
the product did have them up there and
then customers reported pain after
extended use plus some people actually
like to grip the palm rest instead of
keeping their hands on the keys when
they move around so the buttons got in
the way over there overall it definitely
works well enough but I think that it's
safe to say that you're not going to
achieve the same precision as a regular
Mouse probably ever but what if you
didn't have to move the whole module
introducing the key mouse track now with
this version you get a trackball for
each hand and because it's stationary
you also get a buttload more keys
including the number rows which is
awesome and the front mounted clicks
that were on my wish list which would be
sick except that they don't line up with
this finger they line up with this
finger which is gash thankfully there's
a third option as long as your hands are
big enough this little post guy up here
is also a left-click but wait there's
more key the house also sells mounting
brackets that let you strap these
puppies to your chair like you're on the
bridge of the heck and Starship
Enterprise it's crazy your colleagues
may raise an eyebrow but only because
they covet the splendor that you alone
revelant seriously though it does really
feel like the interface you always
wanted and it's ergonomic AF if only it
weren't equally jank not only are the
mounting brackets attached with the
velcro straps that can irritate bear
arms but the brackets themselves sold
for $45 are plastic so the whole thing
ends up flexing under your keystrokes
it's like having a mechanical keyboard
with no backplate or even negative
backplate plus one of mine straight up
broke these suck they need to be metal
and bolt to the chair so I guess we're
talking about the weak points now ki
mouse opted to go all-in on 3d printing
which gives them an advantage in terms
of rapid prototyping and the ability to
offer multiple SKUs like there's
multiple sizes of the chemos outfits
awesome but well none of the alternative
keyboards i've tried have matched the
finish of mass-market products from say
horse air or logitech and well as far as
3d printed objects go these are actually
pretty nice there are still a bunch of
irregularities or maybe artifacts in the
finished product it's not a deal breaker
for me
but it definitely contributes to a
cheaper look and feel hey but at least
they give you nice braided cables
instead of cheeping out like urgh Oh
docks yes but that said it's unlikely
that you'll either never really need
them because these are the first pirgos
I've seen that are Bluetooth with a USB
rechargeable 1400 milliamp hour battery
in each module another strong point for
these keyboards is their intuitive and
robust software that lets you customize
just about anything you can imagine you
can remap all the keys all the buttons
and even the mouse wheels on up to 6
layers you can make each Mouse module
have a different dpi or make the mouse
motion a different function like using
one trackball as a scroll wheel you can
make a single click register as a key
combination like alt f4 and you can
program full-on macros as long as you
have the software running in the
background slight the merit there so
then is this the ergonomic keyboard to
buy well it's 500 bucks that's extreme
for a keyboard but I have to put it in
context ergonomic keywords are typically
around three hundred and fifty dollars
which merely makes it expensive in the
ergonomics space and if you take the
mouse out of the equation I put the key
mouse about on par with the advantage
too as far as organ omits and features
so the question becomes really whether
having integrated wireless mouse is
worth a hundred and fifty dollars and I
guess that depends on you and your RSI
you
it's shoulder related and can't be
solved simply by switching to a vertical
Mouse then the key Mouse could be your
best and only option unless you want to
mess around with foot pedals or
something
so my advice then is to poke around key
mouse's forum where people many of whom
have tried a ton of the different organ
or keyboards that are available in the
market today post reviews and are happy
