tech tips prime day duels stream which
is a bit of an oxymoron because I think
we all know that Prime Day is a
completely contrived holiday that was
created only so that you would buy
things but then of course it stands to
reason that there would be deals to buy
presumably I've actually heard that this
year's prime day is not too shabby but I
have no confirmation of that yet because
I have actually yet to open up an amazon
website to check it out so this is this
is my first time this stream is brought
to you guys by honey so the first thing
both Anthony and I are going to be doing
maybe while I talk about it you could
fire over to anthony's laptop the first
thing we're gonna be doing is installing
the honey browser extension so honey is
a super simple tool it's free you
install it in your browser so anthony's
installing the chrome extension right
now and what it does is on popular
websites like Amazon Newegg Best Buy and
more it scours the site including all of
the third-party sellers takes everything
into account coupons codes shipping all
that kind of good stuff and finds you
the best possible deal on every item so
as we are browsing and actually we're
both logged into the same Google account
so I think that's gonna throw the
extension on my yes my laptop to at
exactly the same time how happy is that
so as we're browsing we're gonna have
all the best deals for prime day and
we're gonna go ahead and compare now the
one thing that we haven't talked about
yet Anthony came down he was like oh
we're doing a prime minis dream I'm down
to do a prime day stream but we don't
actually have a plan yet right so here's
what I was kind of thinking you do the
AMD machine oh and I'll do the Intel
machine we're doing this again and we'll
see who gets a better deal because I
think okay so on the one hand AMD just
launched some pretty compelling products
linked pretty exciting Rison third gen
is the B's freaking knees but Intel is
probably highly motivated right about
now so I may get a pretty good deal
maybe yeah what do you think no you know
okay so
okay first thing we need to do is
actually find some Prime Day deals we've
got spotlight deals so I could get a
fire TV stick with Alexa voice remote if
I was really into that I don't have
KitchenAid mixer doodad you got out of
that nope I'm doing amazon.ca OOP no
amazon.ca is is for chumps hmm
also known as Canadians they don't need
good deals up in Canada holy crap do
they have like they have like a Shopping
Network thing what look at this they
have a video on the on the prime day the
prime day site here alright so coming
soon it's gonna be a big deal got some
shoes where do you find just like I only
want tech yeah like apparently they're
they've got a really good deal on fire
TV yeah that's great trending deals you
can get cheez-its
for six seventy seven is that even a
good deal App Store and iTunes gift
cards for $10 off that does seem like a
pretty good deal I don't need that right
now though do you know how to navigate
Amazon um not really I actually find
their site extraordinarily difficult to
find things on like I remember we were
trying to do like a PC buyer's guide at
some point or another and just trying to
like sort by RAM speed just like forget
it I'll go to anyway like I just can't
well it's really bad out of that but
over here on the left hand side yeah
computers and accessories on the
departments there we go
all right well I don't know I was
actually kind of interested in some of
the other stuff there okay so there's
your yes no no it's fine UPS lightning
cable I guess this sort of qualifies as
tech a hard drive dock for 17 bucks
somebody's don't really stand out like I
remember us selling just like cheapo
hard drive docks back at NCIX for like
17 bucks back in the day our end gear
brand India yeah remember end gear
um also known as no name here remember
tp-link used to be like that
routers okay well here's a pretty cheap
RGB all-in-one water cooler I'm gonna
throw that in my cart I feel like I'm
gonna have to start a spreadsheet pretty
quick here well I found a motherboard
for you oh thanks this is all like
accessories and stuff yesterday Dell
c120 who actually buys like for their
own personal use who buys a kensington
laptop lock I've never had one holy crap
there's only two days of our there's
only two pages of computers and
accessories deals you know what I
thought there was a separate category
for electronic components like computer
components um I think it's a subcategory
am I wrong is there just nothing here
here's a thermal take tempered glass RGB
Edition case any want USB see MagSafe
adapter type c2 MagSafe here's a crucial
8 gig ddr4 dimm hmm go ahead and throw
that in there
the Azio retro classic keyboard holy
balls is this actually it ends the Xth
700 wait a second so this is just some
oh no that's 3200 so that's some decent
Ram it's over ish it was like 15 bucks
off I guess that's like okay PNY solid
state drives SATA though I don't see
that are you on dot CA know.com that's
weird
are we getting served different deals
you're on computers and accessories
right yeah you don't have any other
filters set no wait
Oh active yeah it's the same as we
looked and missed well why would I want
missed deals for why would that be the
default behavior mm-hmm
here's an $80 monitor
I'm just gonna throw everything that's
even remotely relevant in my in my cart
and I think I've already got it I think
that's it why do I not see that P my SSD
how'd you be 81 keys mechanical keyboard
is that on your first page or second
fist my first page now there's a
Thermaltake core over here what yeah you
know for a moment I was feeling kind of
bad for crapping on Amazon site design
in a stream about shopping on Amazon but
I'm feeling super vindicated right about
now because we are being served really
different pages control-f PNY nothing
3-pack of 120-millimeter archie beach
pwm fans with the hub for 90 bucks
control FP NY on this page RGB I just
checked both pages wait you only have
two pages yeah I'm in the trending deals
though oh I've been trending deals okay
so my deals are more trendy than yours
but mostly nothing special
yeah there are very trendy deals blue
light blocking glasses for cheap my
trackpad to stop working for a minute
there something alright alright you know
what
um I'm getting on this I'm getting a
Google sheet going G google.com here we
go I'm just gonna open up a butcher tabs
alright that seems like not a bad
strategy 'ls why would it reactivate
that stupid button I'm gonna have a look
at upcoming deals though computers and
accessories all right up to 50% off
select PC gaming laptops desktops
monitor so you have to go to a separate
page for that hmm save big on select
drives and stores really Prime members
save up to 40% on laptops monitors
desktop okay what is the difference
between save up to 50% off PC gaming
laptops desktops monitors and save up to
40% on laptops desktops monitor
that's so stupid they're the same
category
oh no PC gaming oh this is gaming
laptops desktops and monitors this site
is terrible how are they like the top
retailer in the world that's actually a
pretty good deal on a motherboard I'm
assuming that was the one you were
telling me before the 370 p2 yeah yeah
there oh my goodness okay I'm gonna
start oh and of course there's no
convenient way to just navigate to the
end so I have to type things in like a
caveman
did that even work I think that worked
anything is possible
I can find that out for you display
settings
OMP 510 but it wants me to sign in yeah
oh man I can't I can't get some of these
deals cuz I'm not signed in oh well you
should probably sign it I can sign it
for you if you need yeah if you could do
that I remember the password as long as
people don't see it and or hear it yeah
sure in a sec yeah it's ah
uh-oh oh boy
No
I I don't know anymore okay
okay you're in LastPass now so you
should be able to sort it out from there
hooray keep me signed in please yes I'm
actually finding the shopping experience
really unpleasant oh yeah like you you
can't actually see the deal I clicked on
a deal you signed in brought me to the
home page you know what maybe yeah the
search box says prime day so like if I
were to do like say RT x 2070 cuz those
are dead that's actually not a bad idea
not a great deal no well okay it's a
pretty good deal Department's
electronics although I think they were /
- that to begin with or think ah ah you
got a you got a readout just in case
people aren't looking at your screen are
you guys on Anthony screen yeah the rise
in 2700 X that got price drop didn't it
or is this a this doesn't look like a
prime day deal no I think that's just
the price of that now yeah oh yeah sure
oh boy I don't I don't want to sign in
right now
but I do want to see this is this the
best time to buy check the price history
oh cool okay so we can find out if
they're just lowering prices okay so
yeah it was just the price drop yep okay
I'm gonna have a look at the PC gaming
deals here it seems to be mostly laptops
so if I wanted to pick up a laptop like
a Helios 300 for 900 bucks is probably
pretty wow that's actually pretty sick
8750 H GTX 10 61-44 Hertz IPS display
256 gigs nvme 16 gigs ddr4 that's like
pretty awesome a last gen blade
Dean so this is not the OLED 111 hundred
bucks for well the tough thing about the
blade is that that's basically the same
price as the Helios yeah it's got a
nicer shell but it's $200 more and it's
only a 60 Hertz display so the Helios
300 is looking pretty good there what
else we got here
ballistics Italy a 16 gig kit for one
hundred and fifty dollars
yeah it's thirty six hundred megahertz
but I really don't think I'd pay hundred
and fifty bucks for that no there's some
idiot service spectryx 82 spectryx
that's like 120 yeah that's way better
yeah
2700 X is also in here and say ideal of
the day apparently so maybe maybe that
was dropped lore I think it might be
like regular price 250 according to what
honey was singing but I'm not sure lots
of headsets in here for anywhere from
you know 10 20 Cloud twos or 30 bucks
off uh in the red variety be a terrible
idea
thank you oh I see wow so it's like the
MSI sail so some of these they're not
actually showing you what the price is
until you click on them and then it says
prime debil even like underneath the
actual price so you get a certain amount
off so it's even worse of a shopping
experience than we initially thought it
was this is gonna be a pain in the butt
cuz yeah even just going through this
like this list
it just says primed a DL prime to deal
you can't actually see any of the
pricing you have to click through on
every single stupid thing so like how
much is this SD card primed a deal 20
bucks
you're saving six dollars I mean hey six
bucks is six bucks but also here let's
have a look at the price history
that doesn't look bad
how about that price history whoo it was
just on sale for that price $25.99
$25.99 and today 2594 yeah baby I like
it
this here is legitimately 20 bucks off
and each one 50 I Pro yeah but I mean
from our recent experiment the H 150 I
Pro isn't a good deal even at 150 bucks
getting off two of them with it okay I
think I have to stop looking at the
lists of prime deals because it's just
kind of overwhelming so I'm gonna just
go CPU and okay so I'm going Intel right
that's the plan gonna build the best
best insulting desktop I can let's have
a look at 9,700 K and see if there's any
deals here so this is no there is no
primed a deal honey is checking price
changes for me here they might have just
dropped in response to AMD though we can
see if maybe that's a that's a good deal
today so yes these are down as of July
11th from around 417 to 360 five bucks
so remember your speculation that Intel
was doing unofficial price drops through
just kickbacks it looks like that does
appear to hold some water so 369 is what
a CPU here is gonna cost you and you can
bundle in this motherboard for a hundred
and thirty you know I'm gonna go with
just the CPU for now what do you got
this here so no no it said like oh it's
$1.99 well it's $1.99 because it's the
deal of the day it's not a prime deal
but it's a deal of the day and it just
happens to coincide with Pandey I see
yeah okay that's a pretty decent okay
you know
are there what are like what's pricing
on the third gen stuff
I'm assuming it's totally untouched but
if you could save even ten bucks on that
I'd be yeah I'd be more excited for
third gen
I mean 2,700 X is decent processor like
that's what we're running in our land
center if I recall correctly they want
me to search from prime deals yeah but I
want to build a decent machine not
everything is a prime they deal either
that 2,700 X is a deal of the day yeah
like okay dick flip over to my screen
here so I just searched for CPU in prime
day okay
so we've got our 2,700 X which is
Amazon's choice we've got a thread
Ripper 2950 X that's a hundred and
thirty bucks off or whatever that looks
170 bucks off those looks alright if
you're into going thread Ripper at this
point doesn't make a ton of sense to me
but you know whatever floats your boat
we've got the balloon charm my Val 18
carat gold plated cubic zirconia
engagement wedding ring for $17.99 gifts
for girls cheap engagement rings wow
that's creepy we've got the hydro Series
H 150 I okay remember save we've got the
best year computer CPU stand kart CPU
holder with four caster wheels under
desk oak we've got the CPU holder under
desk mount we've got another Corsair
cooler we've got some thermal paste some
fans a CPU cooler a thermal pad what am
I supposed to do
where are the prime date deals on CPS
there's two freaking CPUs this is a
shirt what do you people want from me I
mean this might be an okay deal for a
radiator but it's not a prime day deal
unless it is it doesn't say anything
about prime this is even on sale like
what is this even doing here
okay this is a fine but it doesn't say
anything about that it's seven dollars
off doesn't even say it's a prime day
deal yeah it's probably garbage
new wake has a better deal in the 2700
well conveniently honey works on new egg
2 so we're under no obligation to mop
the fantastic sale oh boy oh boy well
you got it you got a brand it's
something you know that's just search
for Eisen and see it comes up you know
what I am no longer committed to doing
all of my shopping on on Amazon here I'm
opening my I'm opening my mind mobo
graphics PSU here I'm making up a quick
spreadsheet here I'm probably missing
some things SSD case you can see if
those deals on OS alright 2700 X that I
think is no that's a worse deal as the
2700 a good deal 50 bucks less that's
pretty hot I'd say 20 700 at 149 is a
red-hot deal actually yeah cuz I mean
what are you getting with the 2700 X you
get a little bit more like a couple more
hundred more a couple hundred megahertz
more yeah and that's Inc I think does it
come with the same cooler I believe so
not that it matters because you should
be you should be overclocking that chip
anyway breathe fire okay so it doesn't
come with the Wraith max okay you know
what though I mean I you know how with
the Wraith max you can kind of overclock
the 2700 X about as far as it'll go
anyway yeah it's not thermally limited
yeah you know what that's a tough that's
a tough call
I'm gonna see if there's any any Intel
CPU deals here and another quick tough
call is do you get a 2700 X 2 for 199 or
do you get a 3600 for 199 o 3600
depending if you're a gamer I want the
faster third gen rising well 3600 is
definitely gonna be faster for a gamer I
mean what's it you know what let's just
build a PC together because I'd rather
just discuss the one PC that we're
actually gonna recommend people to buy
rather than try and build two competing
builds here so why do we base it around
a 3600 then basically I'm admitting I
can't compete with the 3600 at 199
that's it's true that's what just went
down there I'm in tell can't you can't
either
ouch
so Amazon actually happens to have that
chip for exactly the same price yeah
that's just regular price so
unfortunately it's not a deal but maybe
we can see how good of a deal we can get
on this sort of this computer on the
computer that we're gonna build around
it so why don't you buy on Newegg and
I'll buy on Amazon okay and they're
looking some pair of carts at the end
okay all right so I'm going 3,600 $1.99
from amazon.com here honey was not able
to find me a deal on that but that makes
sense because this is a brand new chip
with no yeah no real deal and II would
be insane to reduce the price on that
right now
now I'm gonna bring up a Seuss's PCIe
gen for compatibility matrix here
because I don't know that I'm
necessarily interested in spending extra
for an x5 70 board especially with that
active cooling you know if all I think I
really need PCIe gen 4 for is my storage
hmm I think that's the most likely
short-term use case for it so yeah and
some of them only have enough like
leeway on the chipset to do the m2x for
exactly so if I was to go for something
like a you know let's have a look at
like a tough x4 70 plus gaming so I'm on
Amazon right in your own nuoc yep so you
want to do export 70 we'll see there
might be a motherboard deal you never
know especially on x4 or 70 year old or
you would think p450 stuff yep that's it
so I searched motherboard in prime day
I've got a strict c39 de a gigabyte x4
7d board pretty decent board looks like
yeah but it's $15 off unless there's
more unless there's more off another z3
90 and a z3 70 and then a bunch of
random garbage like that's worth what
the heck
well let's have a look at this gigabyte
board primed 8000 99.99 oh that's sucked
that's not bad let's see if I can find
that over here I'm pretty sure that's a
good price I mean my sister's gaming is
the gaming five give me five right okay
this is apparently a red-hot deal
because the latest price on this thing
was one hundred and eighty five dollars
so I'm taking it I like is that the
gaming five uh it's the youris ultra
gaming
oh well it's ninety nine over on Newegg
Oh exactly
oh wait no no it's the same price then
yeah okay well whatever that's fine I'll
take it
Add to Cart let's build the same PC well
I are there any better deals on new ink
because part of the problem on Amazon
was that there just weren't any deals
let's take a look at what am new eggs
fantastic sale has to offer I'm gonna
leave a couple of my monitor deals in
the cart just in case those end up being
alright
also there's this Coolermaster $75.00
dual dual fan EIO
i'm gonna hold on to that for now as
well alright ddr4 okay primed a deal
search for ddr4 come on guys
why is prime video the first thing that
comes up Oh for crying out loud it's
unfortunate that the compatibility
matrix on that PCI Express 4.0 is
specifically a soos because from what I
can tell a soos has weaker BRMS on there
before 50 series motherboards than most
other vendors that's a bummer
yeah okay I've got some prime day ddr4
deals this actually looks not bad we've
got a vengeance LTX 3600 this video
isn't out yet guys but Anthony spent
most of last week working on memory
speed versus memory latency on Rison to
determine what is sort of the
balance and actually it turns out there
are multiple sweet spots but what we do
know is that ddr4 36-hundred happens to
be one of those sweet spots so I am
really liking that vengeance deal right
now but I'm just gonna keep going down
and see if there's anything else that
really stands out to me see I would
definitely pay the extra here so the
3600 is 80 bucks mm-hm and then there's
a vengeance deal for sixty seven dollars
for three thousand would you pay the
extra thirteen absolutely yeah that's
probably the right call what do you got
from other board deals over there not a
whole lot to be honest most of its like
twenty or thirty bucks off not seeing
the ideal motherboards I'd like to see
from Asus here a lot of as rocking
gigabyte stuff there is some isus but
it's mostly like B 450 Plus which I
don't think is on here yeah I think it
is before okay no it is and that one
also happens to have Gen 4 16x support
so that's not a bad debt how much is it
yeah it's 20 bucks off heck yeah so
interestingly that memory deal is only
about 10 bucks off compared to before
according to honey but hey ten bucks ten
bucks yeah have a nice lunch I'll take
it well mediocre lunch mediocre let's
subway lunch yeah all right what's next
I need a power supply now power supplies
are one of those at least traditionally
speaking anyway one of those higher
margin categories with that said the
entrance of EVGA in the market has
really taken a lot of the profitability
out of the category for a lot of the
other brands so I'm gonna give it a shot
and see if I can find a power supply
deal here are people interested in this
Jake
oh I'm sorry guys I really don't know if
I can spare time to dink around with the
Intel video card control panel thing
this this brand oh boy yeah they've been
showing up a lot lately I have never
heard of that I know is that like
someone's offshoot brand kind of like
Zaid axes who owns say Dax
511 can you remember Jake I can't
remember I look the next sense there's a
vector on them maybe say dad I looked
them up I thought that oh boy was like
their own thing though I mean there's so
many like weird freaking brands that
I've never heard of before when I go to
a show like on every year I go to
Computex I'll see another half a dozen
brand brands that I've never heard of
before
yeah because just to be clear guys I'm
not talking about companies that
actually manufacture DRAM modules those
are few and far between that's your your
Samsung your SK Hynix and the like
there's not a ton of those but brands
that just buy those and then just solder
them to modules and go hey we made
memory those are a dime a dozen looks
like I don't have quite a good deal on
memory as you do know yeah there's this
32 gig kit of 3600 but most of it is
3200 that's 3200 for 70 bucks is not bad
though yep and I have this old life
stuff oh my do you trust it
I mean Ram is ran right sort of it's
probably like hynek's chips or something
so it's not likely to play well with
Rison with that said the cheap Corsair
is probably hi nice chips so for me
buying cheap Ram comes more down to am i
buying from someone that offers a very
comprehensive warranty and do I expect
them to still exist when it comes time
to claim that warranty mm-hmm so that's
where I would go for if I'm gonna buy
cheap Ram like commodity memory I buy it
from someone that I know that I can get
a replacement from if it comes down to
that it's like it's a lifetime
shun well done well yeah Emily that's
their brand and I mean here's another
factor it might be a lifetime warranty
but where do you need to ship it to
apparently to where Kowloon Hong Kong oh
yeah exactly
okay yeah so I happen to know that
Corsair does their warranty out of
California yeah so I don't know
I mean could get faster performance
today but if it fails I'm not trying to
be a corsair fanboy here anything right
now it's just uh I'm disappointed to see
not much g.skill yeah like there's very
little
well there's one that's sold out so that
was probably a good deal and indication
like it probably was a good deal yep
this is the big jet they've got a bunch
of 3200
although trying to see royal for $100
3200 is interesting there are not a ton
of power supplies in Friday deals and
some of them are so weird like who's
looking for this stuff like look at this
thing here's an a port gigabit power
over ethernet injector with a separate
power supply Slyke yeah cool yeah heck
yeah but why is that a primary why is
that a prime day deal it doesn't make
any sense like you who's asking for this
and there's like weird del dimension
like replacement power supplies like are
the who's thinking like oh oh it's prime
day I'm gonna go requisition some extra
replacement power supplies for our
Optiplex workstations
what kind of shoppers are they targeting
I just don't get it I'm sure that there
is a CEO somewhere who is very excited
there are not a lot of very compelling
looking power supply deals over on
Amazon I've got a $99 rmx which is like
yeah an rmx is a good power supply or
whatever but it's $100 I'm not looking
what it's a 750 watt okay so it's like
yeah it's fine but it's like here we can
hey we can use honey to track the price
history of this item
oh it's also ten dollars cheaper so that
helps a little bit I guess but I'm
willing to bet that this is like you
don't twenty bucks off oh no okay
this one goes for 130 and it goes as low
as around a hundred bucks at least in
the last last month so that's a little
more compelling
no wait yeah it's gone down to a hundred
bucks so it's like ten bucks off so it
went up a little bit right before prime
day and then it's down to ten bucks off
so yeah it's really not that compelling
now the problem is that thermaltake has
a bit of a checkered past when it comes
to power supplies so on the one hand
thermaltake will contract to very high
quality very reputable OEMs for some of
their units yeah and then they will ship
absolute bargain basement garbage for
other units so unless you're paying
really close attention and keeping track
of which particular Thermaltake power
supply you're buying and who exactly the
OEM was it can be a little bit dangerous
now this might be an amazing deal it's
fifty percent off or this might be a $22
power supply with a nice coat of paint
on it
well CD plus rating I'm gonna have to do
a little bit of 80 plus white so this is
probably not one of those you know
fantastic OEM units but hey you know
what I'm gonna I'm gonna google it
speaking of fantastic OEM units I
haven't had any experience with the
Corsair Vengeance power supplies of you
I haven't
unfortunately now Corsair not now they
have used OMS that are not necessarily
the most reputable but to my
understanding they've only had I think
one or two units that have been like
that's a bad power supply and I think
it's been quite a while
the breathing is well there aren't very
many reviews I can't even find any
reviews of this yeah it's probably a
throwaway Thermaltake alright here's a
threat over on tom's hardware for him hi
guys I'm wondering about the thermal
take whatever hopefully there's a reply
I'm using an ax p v of whatever
something something this guy recommends
a CX am yeah they're not saying okay
they say the smart series is not
particularly good but they're not naming
an OEM here
Oh em for the Vengeance series of course
air units is HEC slash comp you case
okay they use exclusively Japanese
capacitors so yeah it should be yeah a
comp you case isn't like terrible like
it's not see sonic but it's it's not
it's not even see WT yeah but I'd go
with that yeah I think that's probably a
pretty good pet how much is it sixty
five bucks that's not bad at all
okay I give up on this thermal take unit
I'm not I'm not getting this there will
take unit it's a $33.00 power supply
with a nice coat of paint so that means
I just need to I mean ok hold on a
second I do have a thermal take tough
power grand 850-watt for $73 and that
should be decent that's probably a
better bet just so you guys know we're
not actually gonna buy these computers
but this is exactly the process that we
go through anytime we are purchasing
something personally yeah because the
thing is you can't memorize everything
about everything so you do end up
needing to look things up sometimes yeah
that number one bestseller for cases on
new egg looks pretty decent I mean it's
not a huge savings but of course they're
carbide 175 are for fifty five bucks
what does honey have to say about it
tougher ground 850-watt gold oh it looks
like it's a surfer unit hmm that's not
bad okay I'll take it
hey with deal 73 49 it was actually
cheaper in the car I like my power
supply deal I think I did all right I
think you did a little bit better than
me actually and that does appear to be
an actual deal so this is a really good
indicator that's one of the things
that's really nice about being able to
check price history on an item if the
price is actually quite a bit lower than
usual that's an indication that this
might be a loss leader as opposed to
just being a cheap item that is has been
artificially marked out so yeah I'm
actually kind of stoked on my power
supply deal no I'm adding that to cart
did that work
yes matter to cart all right have you
moved on to case now I am alright let's
see what I got case ooh
that Becca coup case for earpods 360
degree full protection dual AR hard PC
soft TPU aunty slipcover portable
protective shockproof front LED not
visible air pods case navy blue red
that's my favorite kind
it sounds like a deal alright so I've
got a crystal 570 X got a really ugly
iPhone case got another air plods case
Wow who would buy this hmm that looks so
stupid
like I just you know I appreciate it
though because I would know not to talk
to that person it's true it's great you
know what seal of approval right there
so I think I'm gonna have to throw a
computer in as a keyword here because
there's a lot of tech cases that are not
computer cases it turns out alright
laptop tote bag anything good over there
the steepest discounts are on DIY PC
stuff and of course that's actually
their original price well you can use
honey who by the way sponsored this
dream in
honey we've got it linked in the video
description I forget what the vanity URL
I'm supposed to be specifically reading
for you guys is join honeycomb slash
Prime day linked in the video
description still alright so I've got an
NSAID Xth 700 the deal is apparently
100% claimed though so I think this is
still sitting in prime day deals but
whatever extra prime day discount there
might have been on it is like gone now
oh is that how they're doing it and I
don't know if honey has the degree of
granularity that I would need to find a
price that was lower earlier today so
it's hard for me to tell exactly what it
was
got a carbide 275 R but that's like $90
I'm not necessarily wanting to spend a
hundred dollars on like a prime day case
yeah I could find NZXT H 500 that would
be nice
got some case fans as an age 200
whatever a sky tech blaze 2 is oh no
that's a full computer
Leedy strips I've got an Ed Hardy ninja
snake computer case notebook backpack 1
for 19 bucks that's probably real hello
Amazon an S case for the Raspberry Pi
I'm tempted anyway but I don't know what
I'm looking for
we need one of those what do we need one
of those I doubt it's PI 4 PI 3 3 + p53
or 3 blobby sorry sorry that I can't I
can't spend time diagnosing and fixing
that right now um well I have like Jack
all 4 case deals here there's the
thermaltake core g3 which is nothing
special I mean it looks reasonably well
ventilated but I don't know that I
necessarily want one of these
unconventional layout type machines if I
want nice upgradability and all that
kind of stuff yeah
also that's an SFX power supply by the
look of things so it's not going to be
compatible with my power supply deal
SFX power supplies are more of a
specialty form factor you're less likely
to find a way Oh probably deal then
again there was a prime day deal on an
eight port POA injector so well if it's
not selling it's probably on prime very
well you got for a case you got anything
I've got a lot of like little little
cuts here and there oh here's a ragin
tech that's like really big cut but like
it's still really expensive yeah 150
bucks
it's mhm yeah it's not even gonna work
with the boiler board I chose anyway
well if we have to choose a prime de
deal I guess I'm no I don't really like
this case I'm not going with a pork or
p1 do I just go with the carbide 275 are
actually I haven't clicked through to
see what the prime de deal is yet 65
bucks and that's the tempered glass one
is this one cheaper solid panel is just
not even a deal to people like solid
panel more than tempered glass no must
just be that that's the one the product
manager chose to to hit today yeah so
the the solid panel one has not been
lower than 95 bucks in the last month
I could try window panel but not
tempered glass yeah it was not a great
deal either
okay so tempered glass at 65 bucks that
actually does look like a significant
deal here just go ahead and check the
price history yep that looks good the
lowest we've seen in the last bit we saw
we did see 65 back on June 30th but I
don't know what happened here because it
also jumped up in between the 28th from
the 30th so I'm not sure what that is
maybe it was out of stock in one vendor
and they went to somebody who's like a
scalper oh that makes sense
alright I'm adding that to cart 65 bucks
I'll take it
oh this is neat pop accessories actually
like my power supply deal better than
this I can probably find a better SSD
deal than that - how you doing four case
I decided on the 175 R it's not a huge
deal but how much was it fifty four nine
okay
so I spent ten bucks more I got a 275 R
with tempered glasses here's tempered
glass you know okay so I've got a better
deal there I beat you on the case deal
yeah alright like if you wanted to go
with a DIY PC case there's plenty of
deals on those yeah but there's always
plenty of deals on those yeah especially
in like bundles and stuff a lot of the
time you can get your best deals on
cases in bundles cuz case vendors don't
like discounting their stuff directly
because even though cases are actually
cheap to make a lot of the cost is in
the design the moldings for them and the
logistics of moving them around and
storing them so yes they can discount
them but they don't like to set a new
precedent for like the price of that
product because they also tend to have a
longer life cycle you'll see a case
model lie around for a year two years
three years even in some cases pun
intended and so they don't want to set
these new expected price points only to
be like okay well this sucks
now we have to bring in another
container of these and like they have to
sit there and you don't get that same
sales velocity the next time you hit
that price it's just not the way it
works so they like to be careful about
discounting all right what do you want
to do next what's gonna go with GPUs
okay shipping being expensive I'll worry
in Canada so the shipping estimates are
based on shipping these items out of the
United States into Canada but we're
using amazon.com because most of our
viewers are in the US so you guys
assuming you're buying Prime Day deals
sorry about the confusion there guys um
alright so Amazon's twice behind a deal
basically proves to me that Amazon
doesn't curate their Amazon's choices at
all because it's a GT 710 which is a
giant piece of garbage that no one
should buy and I've had this debate with
my audience many times and I get people
being like you elitist snob some people
can't afford better buy a used graphics
card don't buy e waste a GT 710 is e
waste it's a waste today never mind
tomorrow there is nothing wrong with
buying used hardware if you can't afford
like the fanciest shiniest new stuff
that's what I did yes you have to
actually learn about it and you have to
you know do your due diligence and all
that kind of stuff you might have to do
a deal on Craigslist or a Facebook group
or whatever show up literally with your
computer tower and be like hey can I
plug this in fire up for Mark and make
sure it does an artifact before I take
it I have done that I've done that on
scrapyard Moore's never mind the times
I've just done it personally there's no
shame in that be shameless get better
performance for your money a GT 710 is
worthless and you shouldn't buy it okay
ten bucks ten bucks if I just need like
a second area display output ten bucks
and I get a lot of people telling you
guys like oh well I just need a
secondary display output great then buy
something for 10 bucks did not a sweet
one not something for 15 or expensive
not something for $55 if all you need is
a display output okay there is no place
for high-end basic graphics cards don't
buy them they're stupid thank you what
else do we have here I've got a good
deal on an RT X 2060 superclocked it's
nine plus $30 off with promo code okay
so that's its regular 349 okay and you
could you get two games with it
Wolfenstein Youngblood and control okay
so that seems to be a killer deal it's
no wonder it's the number
best seller right now okay what else is
there in there oh wow
nothing comparable not really this is
sixteen sixty four to forty nine if you
don't like having more performance for
your dog into that if you really must
prevent r-tx from coming into your life
so I've got AMD pulling their Radeon you
know weird random mislabeled cards crap
again I don't know what an rx 580 GTS is
well that's XFX is branding do they just
call it GTS but it's just an rx 580 do
you know that for a fact
I don't know that it's eight me neither
it's OTS xxx - yeah xxx edition I know
is XFX is branding for their overclocked
stuff yeah but AMD and NVIDIA actually
has been dabbling with this and I've
given them a hard time about it too but
they have a long history of just
creating like weird actually know what
in NVIDIA has a long history of it to
remember the 7900 GTO oh yeah yep so
that was basically a GTX but like I
think it was slightly cut down in some
weird way but they were just trying to
get rid of old GTX GPUs without
affecting the perceived value of a GTX
that was back before they called
everything GTX so you guys know
perceived value is huge
in the computer industry like yeah you
ever realized that Apple never has any
sales it's because if they discount
something that diminishes the perceived
value of the product yeah that was a big
part of the reason that Costco wouldn't
carry Apple products for the longest
time is Costco wouldn't sell them at
regular price and Apple wouldn't give
them wouldn't sell them to Costco if
they weren't going to mark them up more
that's why I heard through the grapevine
anyway the GTS xxx is a binned 580 okay
what do you think of a bend 584 well
let's see what the actual deal is cuz
it's not showing the real price on the
product page in some cases yeah okay so
it really is 190 that seems not bad
actually as long as a GTS is not some
weird stupid slightly fewer functional
units something something like we'll
have to actually verify this is what
makes it such a chore sometimes to shop
for like partner branded cards it also
looks like that's not an exceptional
deal there's a 590 here for $1.99 so hmm
and that's also XFX
also with the dual fan cooler on it the
1660 outperforms the 580 and 590 right
because I've got one of those here for
219 ok plus $10 off with with that promo
code well how nice it must be to be team
Newegg today well show off it's almost
like they curate their deals yeah
instead of putting gt7 tens at the top
you know what I should hand string I
should hamstring my Amazon computer just
to teach them a lesson about actually
looking at this crap before telling
people it's the best choice well I was
just giving Newegg praise for curating
their deals but this is under storage
oh really Ram yeah oops
you know nothing is really standing out
to me here I've got a 1050 ti4 189 I've
got an RX 574 169 this is so stupid
a 7750 half-height card for a hundred
and fifty dollars visiontek you know
what good job good job vision tank I
mean this one at least has whatever this
weird vh DCI interfaces so I guess it
can justify itself that way I'm really
not happy with my with my graphics card
deals MLC 60 I have a 1654 179 weight
that's not an aunty I though 16 yeah its
1550 sorry I got this yep nevermind
nevermind I forgot it's 1650 and then 16
60 TI there is no 1660 there is no 1650
ti I'm not sure about that actually I
just get confused Oh is there 1650 ti no
there's not a 1650 TI is there a regular
1660 I believe there is
yeah I will do some super chance I won't
forget 60 oh okay well you know what I'm
man 1660 TI 269 what do you think of
that one it's a little high it's not as
good as your deal that's no certainly
not let me see if Prime kicks in
anything extra here or if honey does 269
no that's it that's it that's the deal
that's the deal and you're gonna like it
yeah I think the lesson here is
basically we're not buying a graphics
card on on prime day for our prime date
computer I'm gonna go with this 580 it
seems alright it's not an amazing deal
but nothing here is so I'm adding it to
cart there you go alright
are you moved to a new Mervan test this
tea already didn't you I'm looking at us
to STIs yeah okay not a lot to be honest
there's a couple of large as as DS with
different brands that I don't know yeah
that's one of those things where this
just there's no point you know why it's
your storage yeah like it's a sigh as
I've gotten older and a little bit less
or a little bit more risk-averse I've
come around to the idea of spending more
on certain components just for peace of
mind
even if objectively that like you know
Jinjiang tech whatever like SSD uses
great quality NAND and a good controller
theoretically it's fine
just like yeah I I want someone to yell
at if something goes wrong so I tend
towards your Samsung your crew
intel then there's the Q stand desk and
yeah Q sees a major factor you could
have that's a great point you can have
great quality componentry on even
something like a graphics card even you
know like oh these are great VRMs but if
they don't actually go through at the
end that's one of the major costs of
mass production is going through at the
end and actually checking and making
sure that all those great quality VRMs
are not duds they don't actually do that
you could still get a bad unit even with
high quality components on a board 500
gigs for 65 bucks there's an MX 500
that's a decent SSD is fine like a team
group 512 gig SATA 3 SSD 438 99 yeah
it's probably fine I mean personally I'm
kind of tempted to go for a SanDisk
Ultra for 60 bucks instead but you know
that's old stock now right 110 bucks
Canadian for qlc nvme 1 terabyte that's
not bad
Sabourin also has an nvme drive 60 bucks
for 512 so that would be qlc I got 60
bucks for 512 on an Intel 660 P you know
what if this is a historically
relatively low price on the 970 Evo I'm
just gonna get a Samsung wouldn't go
with the qlc you know what why
yeah but do I really need more than 500
gigs like to me 500 gigs this sort of
it's one of those magic yeah this is not
a low price at all like how much is your
970 it's been as low as like 75 bucks um
my 970 is $90 for 500 gigs yeah I got a
2 terabyte qlc at Drive here for 194 not
from Intel yep 660 P okay that's not a
super high performance drive like at all
no but it's also a 2 terabyte em - yeah
so you've got 2 terabytes of m2 and it
does wait is it no that's cashless right
uh I think the 660 P like it doesn't
have an opt-in cache it's not that one
right I think that one uses part of it
and and as like an SLC oh right yeah or
an LC cache even maybe it doesn't have
to be REM - I can't imagine Intel
shipping I mean look I think that's a
different package right there yeah
that's what I was thinking
but it's blocked out I'm pretty sure
that's has to be a dear and packaged coz
there's your controller mm-hmm there's
your freedom and yeah and that that it's
the shape of a D Ram package I could be
wrong I mean here right let me let me
google it for you
660 P do um cache so we talked about
this a little while back but basically
buying an SSD without a DM Ram cache is
a super bad idea it's not gonna last as
long and the performance is gonna suck
uh yeah yep 60 CP does have a turn in 56
Meg ddr3 cache okay yeah well I wouldn't
feel too bad about that to be honest
honestly that looks like a pretty good
deal to me
I don't really have anything here that
stands out to be honest with you what a
hard drive oh I don't need a hard drive
well not a tutu not a tooth here we've
got a two terabyte yeah you've got a two
terabyte m2 you won the game but if you
can get a bigger hard drive for less oh
my prime my prime de search disappeared
I'm not - all right let's see if they
let's see if anything shows up here so
I've got a WD black 1 terabyte for 174
like I don't think I'm doing that I
think if I'm spending that kind of money
I'm just gonna go for a 970 Evo because
honestly it doesn't perform in a normal
consumer workload that differently
125 first hour force MP 510 that's like
I'm pretty last gen I'm about to at this
point yeah but does that matter I guess
not
cuz like the MP 510 isn't that old yeah
it's just also not that great of a deal
like I am paying a good twenty twenty
five percent more per gig than you are
for a six sixty P that is probably a
faster Drive than a six six oh yeah
though you know what that's not a bad
deal I can get the truth out that you'd
had to make but like okay whether you
make that call depends on how much you
have the store and how much you really
care about the reaction time I've still
got a one terabyte class drive and it's
119 in the cart so I'm gonna go ahead
I'm gonna do that what else are we
missing I feel like now's a good time to
go check out our carts actually yeah
probably not literally check them out
just look well really oh alright good
try um yeah keyboard and mouse is so
subjective it's hard to I mean I can
have a look at what there is on promo I
don't think I'm gonna bother with
monitor I uh I don't know okay so we've
got CPU we both decided on rise in 36
hundreds was that it yep
I think the 3600 is such a fantastic
value right now yeah there is nothing
that touches it
all right so I ended up with a gigabyte
X 470 board I never actually validated
that that was gonna work with PCIe Gen 4
but I also ended up with a PCIe gen3 SSD
anyway so alright I ended up with a 275
our case you've got a 175 are yeah I
like what a super class is it tempered
glass apparently Oh in that case I
actually don't mind your deal at all uh
I'm only ten bucks more I guess I and
that's counting a mail-in rebate no no
that's plus a millinery you also have a
mail-in rebate yeah are you sure because
that happens to be exactly fifteen
dollars I think Newegg advertises after
Mir pricing do they I think so yeah I
think my deal is actually better than
yours Oh No forty bucks 40 bucks
alright oh you won the case mm-hmm okay
that's RGB I think I won the power
supply do I get to win the power supply
maybe I mean the Corsair Vengeance isn't
as good a power supply as that is a
pretty sure yeah and I only paid another
like eight dollars yeah then you also
have a ten dollar rebate card so you're
only paying fifty five bucks dang it but
you also have to fill in Mir s much is
your time worth Anthony and then I get
these little like prepaid Visa cards or
whatever like all right motherboard I
think we're both pretty close on
motherboard yeah I'm with Abby for 50
plus yeah I'm getting technically a
better chipset but I don't know that it
actually matters what features does the
x-series chips that have that anyone
cares about the bifurcation anybody care
about that someone but like most people
I don't think it makes a difference did
I win the RAM deal 80 bucks for thirty
six hundred sixteen gig you sure did
okay I've got 3,200 although mine's RGB
and what's your what's your Layton sees
mine's se 18 kit so it's not a
particularly low latency kisi 16 K okay
I fail so I might win here thank you
uh can we find something that I want in
okay I have a cooler master master
liquid for 75 bucks oh you know actually
dual fan RGB water cooling I didn't get
a cooler okay so then I win by default
with the Wraiths yeah I mean I can go
back and get a cooler yeah I'm gonna see
if there's anything better to oh I'm at
it
whoa there's a cheaper one there's a
forty seven dollar dual fan one think I
like that tonight we're heart
yeah 47 buckaroo knees as long as they
have yeah it's got AMD compatibility
yeah I like that one that deal is 61%
claimed let's see what we've got for
water cooling here if you dunk on my
water cooling deal again I'm gonna be
super upset that's the only fret I have
there's nothing else I can do to you was
that that was the ll 240 right let me
have a look here and how much was it
so it's an LC 240 e LC 248 yeah and how
much forty seven bucks I think let me
double-check
yeah 47 bucks I wonder if this is better
yeah ml 240 oh that's a higher grade
David yeah yeah yeah mine's a super
basic one well I don't know if super
basic really is beaten by better in this
case because it's just is it just the
turkey beef and mine has RGB fans - and
mine also just has a really basic
looking cool plate and stuff so I'm okay
I don't I know it's amazing
you know what's really stupid though
like a knock - ah Nhu 12s is like 58
bucks and then I could have an October
loo so I don't know probably the same I
think Noctua is pretty strict about
enforcing not trashing their pricing if
I recall correctly not that I you know
for a long time deals every now and
again Oh every now and again
I also remember it being just basically
really stupid - trash
noctua margin because the margin was
really good because they don't like
people
slashing pricing and it doesn't really
sell that much more because people who
know Noctua they buy Noctua and people
who don't know Noctua they go buy
something else so yeah there is nothing
on you can't really do yourselves any
favors just Newegg not Kerry not chula
no no the in this say the sale oh and
the sale I mean that deep cool one for
50 bucks is probably decent yeah I'm
wondering about its mounting mechanism
though it's like that scissor thing that
Coolermaster does yeah I would pay extra
to avoid that mount that's fair um all
right so I think I won cool yeah yes
what's something do we want to have a
look at some monitors do that alright
it's quickly add that actually I'm gonna
have a look at super chat and see if
anyone is shrieking at us about like a
thing that we outright missed got case
power supply motherboard cooler CPU Ram
graphics card SSD that's just yeah I
think we're in pretty good shape we
didn't get an OS but mm-hmm
those are rarely on promo anyway so I'm
not too concerned general do not let me
see if I can even find so this is so
great YouTube just dumps me and don't
show my screen right now if you don't
mind something is harder to use YouTube
just dumps me in the new creator studio
which is great except it doesn't have
features like oh I don't know the live
streaming dashboard so that I can
actually see super chat so it's just
it's by default now and the the classic
dashboard actually contains ads when you
navigate between pages that tell you to
try out the new creator studio so
obnoxious hey you know we got a new
creator studio yeah I did specifically
avoiding it Raymond says Mary prime day
one at all got myself an 8 terabyte
external hard drive for a hundred pounds
sounds heavy must have cost them a lot
to ship that to you hey it's a joke cuz
you're from the UK crazy.we monkey says
Amazon workers are striking today don't
be a scab well I'm not
working in the warehouse so I think it
would be hard for me to be a scab today
yeah I saw that it's like oh yeah don't
be a scab don't buy that's not how it
works
Dylan says Linus can't compete with
Anthony on building a PC well we ended
up building it together so I didn't have
to Chronos says take my free super chat
Ashton says Linus do the thing James I
want to save $2 sent us $2 timtam says
wish calm has better deals we are
actually working on a wish PC your wish
is my command
Dennis says ginny tech dropped a huge IT
bomb on rather than SST okay all right
you know what fine let's address this
thing because everyone and their freakin
I'm convinced it's BOTS at this point
because everyone in their dog is sending
me this thing about the red SSDs just
being stupid cheap and SATA SSDs boy you
think they've been open before I don't
get it like what is the news here yes I
believe it is maybe a new revelation
that they are misrepresenting the
capacity of the M SATA SSDs with that
said that's also nothing new going back
to the early days of computer SSDs
things were often advertised as 500 gig
class so is it is it misleading
absolutely and my huge fan of paying way
too much for cheap M SATA SSDs no I have
I already made a video about that yes
what does Ginny Tec have to gain through
all this oh I don't know maybe the fact
that they sell knockoff red mags so
maybe that's where a lot of this
publicity around this is coming from
because this is not new information so
yes yes this is yeah that's a thing
red mags are a ripoff yeah so is any
proprietary memory like should we do an
expose on memory stick Pro duo like a so
should we tear apart a memory stick Pro
duo and have a look at the NAND on it me
like lose just cheap banned in a
proprietary enclosure
I don't know what you guys want from me
like everyone and their dog is asking me
to make a video about this like I
already made a video about this you know
what that you know what the dumbest
thing about about the red ecosystem is
the fact that you pay for this expensive
fancy media that isn't anything special
and has no special redundancy built into
it or no special resiliency against
anything and they don't even support
dual recording how do they not support
dual recording it's stupid that's the
safest Lee how do you shoot a Hollywood
film on a single point of failure
especially with the number of them that
we've had die
so yeah do I hate red Meigs and think
that they're stupid yes it's just that
that's not news just is Hayes's Franco
says I was given another free superjet
here you go thanks hey soos gun edits
currently I have a 1600 X should I get
the 2700 X or hold out for the yes you
should hold out you've got an a soos X
470 motherboard yes you should hold out
got an RT X 27 t you should hold out the
answer of the answers you should hold
out I would I would definitely save my
pretty pennies and grab a 3600 because
the gaming performance difference
between 3600 and a second gen is quite
significant especially if you have a
powerful graphic card like you do Marcel
in Germany the rise of 726 goes for 216
euros thank you that is fantastic
information Marcel appreciate that
Brennan says Linus you're the best
Scott what are you guys gonna do a 3000
series AMD series X 370 mobile video law
I think we're gonna talk about using
third gen on older motherboards at some
point in the next little bit Anthony's
got that on his list hasn't happened
just yet it sometimes do list you yeah
Anthony has a bit of a to-do list if you
catch my drift
I'm booked out for the next several
months all right what do you got for
monitor deals so I'm gonna get back to
some deals here mostly just scepter
stuff there's the little boy did we like
the most I'll be mango all right yeah
it's down here too
how much is there that's like t9
is that a deal I can't remember how much
it cost I thought it was 399 yeah so
that one was 1440p wait it oh do they
have more than one wasabi mango oh
that's the big one right this one I
thought was a different wasabi mango do
they have more than one wasabi mango I
don't know yeah this is a 32 inch IPS 75
Hertz 10 bit color
no ours was a 4k 120 Hertz that's a
completely different display interesting
so that's not the one we reviewed
interesting I guess if I was them I
would probably do the same thing cash in
on the the recognizability of my very
unique product name that was well
reviewed what else you got I don't know
what this is a deal g-sync Monitor 27 is
165 555 555 yeah fine yeah yeah I don't
know what needs to be curved if it's not
an ultra wide to be honest
hey here's the why is everybody buying
this monitor monitor and it's only a
hundred bucks a that's why everybody's
buying this monitor yeah well that is
usually the answer for that series is
this all is this prime this is prime day
monitors they're all cheap nothing kind
of gaming grade yet got a curved
freesync monitor here if you're okay
with 60 Hertz here's a two millisecond
TN panel for 130 bucks personally I
wouldn't spend that kind of money on TN
at this point I mean I've got some
no-name stuff here like this prison
which is 165 Hertz freesync flicker free
of low light all that kind of stuff
there's a couple problems with that
though like here off TN yeah I wouldn't
spend 260 bucks on a TN panel today and
the issue too is a lot of the time these
no names they'll be advertised with
really high refresh rates but the pixel
response times aren't good enough to
keep up see it just ends up being really
smeary it's not a great experience it's
not like it honestly I think I'd rather
have like a 75 Hertz but with good pixel
response time so at least the image is
sharp
I mean here's a 34 inch ultra wide oh
it's a 1080 l tried 144 hurts though for
380 bucks
I've got a 390 bucks I think it's a
1440p ultra wide nope oh yes oh it's a
fun what
well that just slayed my deal that that
just smokes got free singing - yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah rub it in smart Acer
gaming monitor 20 bucks resync 4k yeah
I'm not into the 4k gaming monitors I
would have preferred to have a higher
refresh rate though Wow I really have
nothing special monitor wise like I
could go with a VG again this is TN but
it's at least 144 Hertz 480 bucks I
could be talked into something like that
but
yeah there's nothing super special here
you know and if I have to choose
something from prime day I guess I'm I
guess that's probably the best gaming
experience that I could buy here oh
what's this
Samsung 27-inch ofhd it's probably not
TN though I don't know if Samsung still
ships TN it's probably their VA I'd be a
lot more comfortable with that but it's
also one millisecond so I don't know see
I wish that we off here we go
okay technical specifications literally
download a PDF thanks Amazon TN panel
nook yeah I'm not spending that kind of
money on a TN panel it just doesn't make
sense underneath us yeah okay what else
we got here like what is this here's
some Acer thing for millisecond response
time this is probably not TN but it's
also probably 60 Hertz you know what I
don't even care I'm taking the 60 Hertz
and I'm hoping I can overclock it to
like 7075 I just can't even I can't even
spend that kind of money on a TN it
depends what kind of gaming you do
though
like if you're more of a twitch gamer
and I don't mean twitch TV I mean like
like twitch response times like if
you're more of an FPS gamer and you only
have a couple hundred bucks to spend I
think you have to go with the high
refresh rate TN but if you're more of a
sight-seeing gamer which is me then yeah
this is sixty Hertz 1440p but it's only
twenty bucks more and it's IPs higher
res I think I like this one better and
I'm with this okay do you want to tell
them 200 bucks
hmm do you have something that slaves me
no just this oh you just want with the
more expensive look yeah yours is a
nicer monitor but you also clearly are
investing more in your monitor
experience than I and I'm going with
them more yeah and it's got a budget
oriented good gamut coverage 99% 99.5
percent us our TV I also have a lower
end graphics card so I can't even drive
that yeah what did you go with again the
580 yep
Oh keyboards we're gonna go the whole
way yeah I don't know if I'm gonna
bother with the keyboard deals keyboard
they're so personal it's gonna come down
to what you guys are into and most of
this is kind of off-brand stuff that I
frankly don't have much experience with
I mean the G nine ten Orion's bark is
$80 off apparently but we can use honey
to see if that's actually legit save an
extra 258 when you apply this coupon
thank you honey you have paid for
yourself already more than because we
paid nothing yeah what that's infinitely
this is the best deal of all Emma's own
sellers okay honey you didn't detect any
price changes in the last 30 days so
here you go we can save 250 you know
what done done
I'm going for it it's RGB hate it all
hate it all you want Jake but it's RGB
the g-9 Tanner Ryan how much balut 90
bucks
I'm primed a deal this oh this is juice
extender I am okay don't have a deal
here No Deal No
the Death Adder elite is $34.99 at that
price you could literally afford to buy
another one when your first one dies it
is a question of win wuji 602 now to be
clear this is not using logitech's light
speed but at 25 bucks and it's heavy but
at 25 bucks huh
that's not bad yeah that's pretty good
like I'd use that for like RTS gaming
for general usage like for first-person
shooter stuff probably I would like to
have the Lightspeed then again you could
just get a G 403 and then if you really
wanted to be wireless you could do our
battery mod that people hated yeah oh is
that the 3ov sorry it's the 305
oh shoot never mind not crap that's
still a really good deal you know what
do I want wireless or do I want a better
sensor yeah let's go with the g4 Oh
through prodigy this one has hero sensor
right no it doesn't it's it has the one
that everyone else ends up using me if I
go whatever right but with Logitech
firmware I'll take it okay sold sold
then thank ferb k70 RGB sounds good to
me
all right I'm done oh really yeah 69
bucks Cherry MX browns yeah I like that
deal my keyboard I actually have this
keyboard it's great me too
that's still the one I use at home yep
sold 10 bucks is a good deal for that
yeah even if it's refurb doesn't matter
I mean 50 million keystrokes or whatever
like how how refurbed could it be yeah
how worn out I guess it was probably
sent back because like an LED went out
or something and they replace them
alright so what's your total cart here
well I haven't gotten a mouse yet oh
okay so I'm adding mine up I'm at about
$1,000 for a 1440p monitor really nice
keyboard and mouse water cooling risin
third gen wait why is it safe for later
oh it's no longer available from the
soul
correct okay so I have to add 300 to my
price so I'm at $1,300 because this does
say 1086 but there's like 25 bucks here
looks like 25 bucks there
like 5 bucks there so we're we're
rounding around 15 there so we're saying
a thousand so 1,300 and I get a 1440p
IPS monitor really nice keyboard and
mouse combo water-cooling 1 terabytes of
nvme storage an RX 580 not that happy
with that I wish I had a better graphics
card deal I got a 275 are with tempered
glass really solid 850 watt power supply
I got nice high speed memory for my
Rison processor and an X 470 board I'm
actually pretty happy with my with my
gaming experience for $1,300 today I
didn't I don't know if I saved that much
though like that's the issue with these
kinds of you know time day things
whereas if you just use a shopping
companion in general a lot of the time
you'll just see random deals and you'll
be able to pick up similar deals if you
just kind of have an ear to the ground
yeah and a lot of the time you can
actually get price matches at a lot of
vendors - yeah so there's that - there's
a lot of razer stuff and not a whole lot
else it's not a bad deal for the
SteelSeries sensei wrong
g 400s is not bad if you're into that
mouth shape yeah its optical though not
a laser yeah that's fine okay yeah
popular misconception well yes but also
typically optical sensors are I'm just
fidgeting okay
he's a predator cestus yeah
bloody I've got one of these upstairs
chief Hornet black wireless wired yeah
that's it that's the end of the sales
yeah not much here I'd probably go for
the SteelSeries to be honest get a sense
a raw yeah okay you know I'm not gonna
argue with that yeah I mean I can a
little bit I'd probably go through 400
and 400 mg 400s is a better deal of
objectively but if the mouth shape
doesn't work for you I mean mics are
very personal I used to actually like
that mouth shape but I'm actually
growing attached to this all right go
for it I've got a G 900 at home so while
you walk us through your through your
cart then okay let's see okay so looks
like my total is 1636 right so you paid
$300 more but 200 of it was in the
monitor yeah you got a way better
monitor way better monitor let's see the
case yeah it's whatever I got a better
case I've got a better deal but yeah yes
you got a better deal motherboard again
it's probably close kind of the same way
that every way better graphics card like
the graphics card deal here is actually
really good yeah power supply man good
deal yeah good deal especially with the
a mail-in rebate but that assumes that I
want to do Amelia mileage may say Ram
probably a wash to be honest the extra
frequency probably is outclassed or
matched sorry but if it's gonna be a
wash
you've got our GB and I don't write so
I've got extra PS just from that same
processor same price I mean it's
brand-new it's not a deal but we both
decided that like for 200 bucks
you should we should just get that
processor yeah for even over the 2700 X
30 yes there's very little reason to go
with the 2700 X over
the 3602 fear of course but like these
are better course guys yeah a lot better
and what mean we tend to lean towards
building gaming machines cuz that's like
that's what we know you've got two of
those oh there's your problem well we
can drop 120 bucks off of that Wow okay
so your deal is now a lot better because
basically 1576 yeah and most of that is
in your monitor so yeah I've got one of
these you've got a 2 terabyte SSD GI one
terabyte SSD that's the other bit of the
but with qlc yeah but it's Intel and
they take their storage reliability
pretty darn seriously yep pretty happy
with this refurbished coursera keyboard
I like that deal I actually really love
this keyboard I like that deal better
than mine Cherry MX browns are still my
favorites maybe I'm old-fashioned but
whatever yeah even if what's the refers
keyboard gonna have as far as a failure
a point of failure compared to a regular
keyboard it could have like diseased
gunk in between the keys yeah but they'd
probably sterilize it that probably
[Laughter]
SteelSeries sensei raw yeah whatever I
don't really mind okay yeah the monitor
which is an ultra-wide 1440p yeah why
don't you brag about it smart yeah let's
go freesync yeah yeah okay 99.5
facetious
it's got DVI hdmi and displayport USB
3.0 hub
it's got swivel all right all right Joe
Smith all right he's a mountable yeah
but how much does that base amount
add-on cost is it $300 oh it's not it's
it's a thousand thousand dollars yeah so
that was it that was our prime day deal
