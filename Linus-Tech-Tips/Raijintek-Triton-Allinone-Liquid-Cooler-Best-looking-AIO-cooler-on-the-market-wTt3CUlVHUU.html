game up with their Triton CPU cooler l1
coolers have been mostly rocking black
tubes since basically the dawn of time
so including clear tubes and the ability
to dye the included liquid yourself or
pre-purchase it pre dyed is a bold move
cotton let's see how it pays off stay
subscribe to watch tech tips for
probably more cooling videos as we get
into the summer season the Coolermaster
Nova touch tkl utilizes genuine taupe or
hybrid capacitive switches and is now
available at a more affordable price
click now to learn more let's start with
a physical tour of the Triton one could
easily say that this is the best-looking
AO cooler out there currently the first
thing you should notice is the
completely clear tubing and CPU block
this allows for more than justice
aesthetic purposes as letting you see
the coolant moving around and the pump
actually working is pretty cool it's
tubing can be a big draw but what isn't
described is just how flexible smooth
and soft the tubes are and that's not
necessarily a good thing they're so
flexible in fact that while it does
allow for far easier installation and
positioning of the block radiator and
tubing they kink extremely easily so
easily in fact that they may be fine
while its installed in most
configurations but I'm also willing to
bet that many users will kink them a few
times during the installation process
the mounting hardware is very solid and
has a good weight to it and it happens
to look good which is kind of great as
well because it will complement that
beautiful reservoir but now on to the
main feature of this whole video the
pump CPU block end reservoir the
reservoir has a fill port for easy
access and fittings that are easily
removable and expandable into other
parts your system like your GPU you
could in fact color the included liquid
and that's exactly what Regin tech
planned they included three colors of
dye in the box red green and blue in
case that's too much tinkering for your
blood which is unlikely but anyways
don't worry right gym tech has you
covered with two other models of the
Triton they have the Triton core which
is the only model that doesn't come with
the included fans
later and also has no added dyes the
next model is the trident RGB which is
pretty self-explanatory
these models come pre colored in our G
or B so you don't have to worry about
possibly making a mess losing your
liquid or screwing up your pump and it's
a good thing that they include this
model in their lineup because there's a
big sanity check here by Triton stated
right on the webpage is that opening the
fill port on your cooler voids your
warranty and they hold no responsibility
for damages caused by the dyes that
being said this shouldn't be too
surprising as it would be very easy for
an inexperienced builder to wreck their
system once that port is opened since I
mentioned them earlier I should probably
talk about the included fans they are
actually pretty decent as experienced in
our testing they push a fair amount of
air and are decently quiet where things
start to get a bit different and strange
is the fact that the fans are actually
tethered together at the cable that
terminates in one three pin fan
connector instead of two the reason why
they did this was done is because they
included an inline fan controller which
is actually pretty cool in theory but I
have concerns for example there are no
numbers or symbols telling you what
speed or voltage the fans are running at
and you have to open up your side panel
every time you need to adjust your fan
speed which can get very annoying I
would have appreciated it if even a like
one to five marking was on it so you
would be more clear in the end let's
backtrack a bit to the box this came in
when you open the box you're greeted by
one tiny piece of closed cell foam over
top of the CPU block to make it a little
bit safer and then mostly just some
flimsy cardboard for the rest yet again
I had some concerns upon researching the
cooler and reading customer reviews on
Amazon Newegg and NC XCOM there were
tons of cases of dead-on-arrival or
leaky coolers not cool anyways it's now
results time as you see in the graphs
the Triton manages to do very well with
our Noctua n ff12 straps to it and even
beating out the h 100 i by a little bit
the stock fans are running at 1100 rpm
we're not very audible at all which is
great but as you can see their
performance wasn't necessarily any
to write home about which is not too
surprising due to these their stellar
audio levels all the trenton may not be
the best performing cooler out there it
definitely gets you to a very
comfortable temperature and easily
enters the expected range of
temperatures for a 240 millimeter cooler
while being one hell of a looker in
conclusion this is one hell of a sexy
cooler and that seems to be a lot of
what people are going for when they're
looking for aftermarket going these days
anyways so that might be fine if you're
not interested in aesthetics or have an
opaque side panel then this may not be
the cooler for you dead on arrival
issues are nothing to scoff at and if
you can fit a 280 millimeter red and
then definitely go with that which I
guess is true for pretty much any 240
millimeter cooler if you're not going
for aesthetics personally I really dig
that you can change the colors of this
bad boy and I like that you can actually
easily drain it to either color match to
a different build in the future just go
back to colorless if you please I'm very
happy to see Triton bringing coolers in
this direction clear tubes and custom
colors is a bit of a gamble for them and
I'm happy to see that so far it seems to
be playing out speaking of looking good
Dollar Shave Club Dollar Shave Club is a
great way to get razors and other
bathroom supplies shipped directly to
your door for only a few bucks a month
the razors are high-quality and we have
a ton of community members who use them
every day and love the smooth shave that
they get no matter how thick or
potentially coarse their facial hair may
be for some reason this comes as a shock
to many people out there but yes I know
I have facial hair but I do still shave
and I would say that I definitely get a
good shave from Dollar Shave club's
razors they're pretty darn nice on top
of the razors they also have dr.
Carver's shave butter which goes on
smooth and clear so you can see what
you're doing which is kind of fantastic
