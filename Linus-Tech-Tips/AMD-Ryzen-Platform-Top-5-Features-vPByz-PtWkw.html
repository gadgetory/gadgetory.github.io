to their suite at CES 2017 they want to
show off their mega GPU their rise in
CPU those are like the sexy things that
everybody wants to talk about but of
course a cpu is nothing without the
underlying platform and that's what this
video is about the top 5 things about
AMD's am for sockets and the surrounding
ecosystem so number one is full support
for enthusiast technologies so I'm
talking about overclocking crossfire and
SLI yes my friends AMD got sli certified
on their X 370 chipset number two is
variety choice so for the first time in
a while AMD is launching a new chip a
new socket with support from the
motherboard manufacturers with an entire
range of products all the way from basic
all the way up to premium products with
reinforced memory slots PCI Express
slots m dot 2 connectors great i/o on
the back all of that good stuff
number three is overclocking all Rison
cpus are going to support overclocking
and it's going to come down to the
motherboard chipset so the X 370 and the
next one down as to whether or not you
are able to tune the frequency of your
chip number for native nvme so the chip
gets 24 PCI Express Lanes 16 dedicated
to graphics another 4 for nvme or SATA
and another 4 to communicate with the
chipset so that's a nice low latency
connection to PCI Express drives number
5 USB 3 support is here in spades you
get up to 10 USB 3.1 gen2 on which is
formerly known as 3.0 so USB 3 5 gigabit
and 2 USB 3 10 gigabits on 3.1 gen2
right off of the chipset itself number 6
longevity so AMD has committed that this
socket will be a
found until 2020 but of course that
doesn't mean anything if they change
electrical requirements so new CPUs
don't actually fit in them they're
saying no no we're not replacing this
until ddr5 PCIe gen 4 and not only will
you be able to put new CPUs and a board
that you buy today with a BIOS update
you can even throw an APU in there you
might have noticed even though Rison is
a CPU with no onboard graphics Raven
Ridge which is n + Vega is coming later
this year and will enable those graphics
outputs that are on a lot of these
motherboards number 7 what was number 7
so there you have it guys the top 5
exciting things about AMD's new platform
on the am 4 socket for their rise and
CPUs 5 yes my friends 5 so thank you for
watching a huge shout out to AMD for
allowing us to be here at CES 2017 don't
forget to subscribe so you don't miss
any of our other IMO fantastic videos
here at the show now I'll see you again
at the next booth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
