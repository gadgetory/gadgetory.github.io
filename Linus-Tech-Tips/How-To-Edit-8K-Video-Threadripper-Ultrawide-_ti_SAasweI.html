work with files that are multiple
hundreds of megabytes per second of
recording with a complex and proprietary
compression algorithm that allows them
to retain effectively nearly the full
raw quality of the footage while taking
up a fraction of the space well
LG's Monitor team seems to have an
interest in this and the many
technological challenges faced by
creative professionals because they
sponsored this video featuring their 49
WL 95 C otro wide monitor where I'll be
figuring out just that so in the old
days when anywhere from 4 K to 6 K was
cutting-edge the solution was this $7000
red rocket X card but in spite of it
using either a custom ASIC or an FPGA so
both highly specialized Hardware even
these puppies were easily overwhelmed by
the epic W and the red weapon featuring
reds 8k helium sensor so now this is
basically an expensive paperweight ha
that's the that's the joys of cutting
edge technology right fortunately NVIDIA
has been running around doing demos with
their arty x-series graphics cards
showing GPU accelerated real-time full
quality 8k playback so then is this the
new way now $1300 is still a lot of
money but it's a lot less than $7,000
could this be progress there's only one
way to find out
so my first encounter with this monster
was back at CES and while 49 inch ultra
woods like this one so 32 by 9 aspect
ratio look at this thing
have existed before what makes this one
special is that the pixel density since
its effectively 5 K by 1440 is much
higher than the ones that have existed
before making it actually suitable for
creative work so it has become apparent
that I'm going to need to clear some
space so it has become apparent that I'm
going to need to clear even more space
wow that's a lot of time line even with
my task manager open here
okay so first order of business is to
fire up a plausible project so this is
an episode of fast as possible and use
the the normal workstations that we have
downstairs so my CPU is a little better
this is a 79 80 XE 18 core processor and
this is a GTX Titan X Pascal so first
things first we've got ourselves at
one-quarter resolution you can see
scrubbing around in the timeline nice
and responsive playback basically
instantaneous but whenever I'm not
paused you can see it's quite fuzzy not
representative of the finished product
so let's crank it up to full so this is
a K and this is working just fine no
problem whatsoever and in fact while I'm
playing it back we're sitting at a mere
10 to about 30% CPU usage and our GPUs
sittin tight at 25 to 30% so at first I
was kind of confused by all of this it's
been a while since I've looked into a K
performance on the timeline and I was
thinking well hold on a second is there
nothing special about these r-tx cards
that makes them suitable for this why
does Nvidia keep talking about this and
then
I remembered something we shoot most of
our projects at a much higher
compression ratio than what they would
use while shooting a VFX heavy Hollywood
production for example so our data rates
are much lower so let's go get some
seven-to-one footage so let's start with
a sample from red here this is a 7 to 1
compression ratio 8k clip that was
recorded at 24 frames per second so
let's go ahead and fire this bad boy up
hit that playback button it oh we are
looking at spikes of up to 95 percent on
our GPU and CPU usage that is pinned at
100% while trying to playback that clip
that is a stark contrast to the I think
we use 2001 is that right David to the
20 to 1 footage that we capture and
that's not even the worst of it here's
some 8k 7 to 1 footage at 30fps that we
captured let's go ahead and drag that
onto the timeline
yeah whoof not quite
yeah he moves like that sure why not so
what's weird though is that even with
the heaviest footage that we could throw
at our workstation our GPU is actually
neither sitting idle nor completely
maxed out so it's being used to handle
the debayering process which
reconstructs the full color image that
we see here from the samples that are
collected by the image sensor but our
CPU is still in charge of the entropy
decoding which is a process that allows
the most common input signals to be
substituted for much shorter ones saving
space and wavelet decoding which frankly
I'm not familiar enough with to offer
even a basic explanation and the
Wikipedia article wasn't much help
anyway though so it's maybe our problem
here is we just need more
cpu horsepower to keep our GPU fed AMD
to the rescue then why don't we try
going from 18 to 32 processor course
building improvements Oh mission failed
okay it worked didn't do anything and
interestingly our GPU usage is higher
near a hundred percent so this is kind
of fascinating I've said it many times
before that every system is effectively
bottlenecked
because there's something that is
slowing down the process or else it
would be infinitely fast but this is
like double bottleneck
it's like they're perfectly matched to
each other but still not enough for the
task this is great to look what happens
to Timeline scrolling when my CPUs at a
hundred percent usage so while I was
troubleshooting to prepare for this
video I actually spent some of my time
with the r-tx twenty eighty rather than
the r-tx twenty atti
because what I thought was that this
functionality had something to do with
their new and vank engine but actually
it doesn't in fact there's nothing about
the tensor cores or the ray-tracing
cores or anything like that that makes
the r-tx cards so good at this it's just
the sheer frigging processing power of
all those CUDA cores so we are gonna
jump for 8k seven to one footage
straight to the RT X xx atti and you
might think to yourself well gee Linus
that's a 1,200 to 1,300 US dollar
graphics card of course it can handle it
but that's not necessarily to be taken
for granted I mean we installed CPUs
that cost up to two thousand dollars and
they couldn't do it it's all about
having the right tool for the job okay
everything's working normally here we go
this is the moment
I mean now that is kind of gotten its
act together that's a lot better we are
now at a hundred percent CPU 95% GPU but
we are still dropping frames so that's
it then no CPU on earth can handle this
30 frame per second 8k seven to one read
code raw footage at least not as long as
it has to handle the entropy decoding
and wavelet decoding what if we could
offload those to the GPU we are going to
need a beta version of Reds decoder that
unfortunately isn't supported by Adobe
Premiere at this time fortunately it's
built into the beta of redson DX pro and
we're gonna start with the 24 FPS
footage now it's a little flaky right
now I'm actually not sure if this is
going to work but let's go ahead and
give it a shot so we're gonna enable GPU
decode and it's flaking out on me so
it's running it like eight frames per
second fortunately the fix right now
seems to be to just toggle between image
pipelines and there it is smooth 8k
playback that hitch by the way is the
clip restarting but that's not even the
most impressive part so our CPU is
sitting at just 10% utilization and our
GPU is up at 77 80% utilization so we
potentially have some Headroom to spare
so our overall usage for the system is
way down like 10% of our 32 cores we
could be doing this on a more human
workstation you know one with six or
eight cores by offloading this work to
the GPU because the thing to remember as
well is that when we were pinning both
our CPU and GPU at a hundred percent
that was just playback
we weren't even applying any real-time
effects like denoising the footage or or
anything like that we were at the limit
now we have Headroom to play with
let's go ahead and try our 30fps footage
though that's actually working a little
bit better than I expected when I the
first time around I actually had to
overclock the GPU a little bit to get
this quite so smooth but you know what
I'm taking it so there it is our GPU
CUDA usage jumps up near 90% but our CPU
stays at 10% and we are smoothly playing
back seven to one 8k red footage at
29.97 frames per second we get some
applause sound effects in the video or
something I don't know
this is crazy so all that's left now
then is to thank LG for sponsoring this
video featuring their 49 WL 95 C W
ultrawide monitor I mean I think it's
pretty obvious why they wanted us to
feature this in this video because it's
designed for content creators like
photographers filmmakers music producers
and more who can really benefit from
this kind of a canvas being able to work
on more than one thing simultaneously or
just be able to manage and see extremely
long timelines without zooming out
giving them a finer degree of control
and it's not even just for creators but
office work would also be a great option
for someone like a programmer stock
trader or really anyone who needs a ton
of side-by-side screen real estate
because it's basically exactly the same
as having to 2560 by 1440 monitors side
by side except that you have no bezel in
between LG's also been hard at work on
software that allows you to take two
inputs select your desktop in your
laptop and seamlessly share your mouse
and keyboard between them just like
moving between them so you can control
two systems at once
it's got full support for USB type-c
including power delivery so you can use
it as a single cable docking solution
for your laptop and it's got support for
HDR 10 with
- ten watt speakers built-in in fact it
was didn't realize they were gonna be
that loud that happened that happened a
couple times during the video so check
it out at the link in the video
description and I guess that's pretty
much it thanks for watching you guys if
you disliked this video well you can hit
that button but if you liked it hit like
get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link below also down
