doing a bit of a range test on the
parrot ar.drone so I got my iPad here
you can see the front mounted camera
view and actually that is well why don't
I show you guys the settings in here as
well can you see that at all no hope if
I go up this way can you see it now okay
cool okay so I'm just going to turn on
outdoor hall and outdoor flight or both
on okay so it looks like we're ready to
go already so I'm also going to switch
on my alternate camera which is right
here okay so that's my downward facing
camera and I just want to show you guys
for the sake of interest but it's a
little bit windy out here today
so you can see that drifting I'm gonna
go ahead I'm gonna take off with the
ar.drone and I want to show you guys how
little it actually drifts even in the
wind check that out so it actually
controls itself using the bottom mounted
camera to keep itself from drifting away
see it got blown away a little bit and
then corrected itself and brought itself
back pretty cool like so we're gonna do
a bit of a range test here I'm gonna go
ahead and fly it down the parking lot
keeping it nice and low no need to put
it up high especially on a windy day
like today
so do do do do do remember this is Wi-Fi
controlled so here I'm gonna go ahead
and stop for a second here there we go
so just for scale guys so the drone
isn't fouled
gotta be at least about 50 60 meters
away at this point and I still do have
my video feed and I still do have
control of the drones so here I'm gonna
turn it around and point it at us let's
see if we can see ourselves here
oh it's getting oh it's pretty gusty
right now so you can see the drone
struggling a little bit but it is
managing to hold itself in place so I'm
just gonna bring it back
hopefully this way tilter that way there
we go
oh okay I couldn't figure out if it was
coming back or not because it's going
kind of slow cuz it's in the breeze here
there we go come on mr. drone
so there you go we can comfortably go
about fifty to sixty meters away without
any difficulties so I brought it back
now let's go for this card and move
along and then we'll we'll pick this up
again in the second so we're back we're
gonna take the drill all the way down to
the end of the parking lot but first
let's go harass our our HR manager over
there
he's all like WTF and I'm all like hello
and I can't see it behind that tree
right now but I'm gonna go ahead and
bring it back over here I think
fantasy mystery
around
I lost my orientation oh I hit the tree
oh here well I'll show you guys what
happens so this is a cutout emergency so
what happens is what the blade here come
come check this out because this is a
great demo of how durable the AR Drone
actually is a cutout emergency occurs
when one of the propeller strikes an
immovable object and what the AR Drone
does is it actually turns off all four
motors before immediately before the AR
Drone even hits the ground in order to
minimize the amount of damage that can
be done to it now the propellers are
made out of a very flexible material
they're very difficult to break I've
crashed it like this a couple dozen
times at this point but what you can see
here is that so yeah we've got that flex
to them and if they all turn off when
one of them encounters an obstacle then
you dramatically reduce the risk of
serious damage to the drone so in this
case we hit a tree and that was bad but
let's go ahead and take off again here
and see if we can do another little
range test here we go
there we are let's go ahead and wow it's
getting pretty windy though I gotta say
this is definitely not the optimal
conditions for for flying a small RC
aircraft like this so let's go ahead and
take it down to the other end of the
parking lot and see how far we can go
I'm flying into the wind right now so
this represents pretty much my top speed
into a strong headwind really here
realistically you're gonna lose control
of the AR Drone in terms of your visual
ability to determine what's forward and
what's backwards before you're going to
lose control of the AR Drone
from the iPad so you can see it's
getting blown around quite a bit over
there but I guess that pretty much wraps
this up
there's my range test on the AR Drone
thank you for checking it out don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech x4
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos so here's cameraman trying to fly
the AR Drone he approves of this product
because he's using the iPad to control
it I'll just zoom in on his his drone
flight here
please don't hit the car cameraman so
we're quite far away at this point I'm
gonna max out the zoom of my camera here
wow I think I can actually see it better
to the zoom than I can with my eyes
oh please don't hit that car yeah this
cameraman flying the drone something's
cool is that if you actually do manage
to go outside of the maximum range of
the drone what it does is it just
switches off and goes into hover mode so
there's no risk of it damaging itself by
like flying away or anything like that
so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
