the wine show got another great show for
you guys I'm sure we've done a great
show once before at the very least oh
wow they turned around the screen on the
camera that's gonna be really
distracting it's awkward I don't think I
can I don't think I cannot look at it
hey one of the hey thanks David what's
wrong with looking at it well no if you
look at it then you're gonna look
slightly off yeah it's kind of like if
you're having a conversation with
someone like this like hi James how are
you today but it's also kind of weird if
you just look into the lens too much for
too long people get mad at that dude no
he yelled at me once on a video about
that yeah okay well what happened was I
was trying to read the script and it was
the first time that it wasn't tackling
to a tech wiki and I actually had to
interact with a product I was using so I
was trying to read the teleprompter
which is right in front of the lens and
then I was trying to look away sometimes
at the thing and hold it and present it
yeah and I was not skilled enough to go
from that back to my spot on the
scrolling text right and so I kept
screwing up so when the final edit came
through and the editor was done putting
it all together all that takes that work
every take that worked was one where I
looked right in the lens without
blinking
so the final hi everyone I am talking
about this product I am NOT a robot I am
a Humana final video was super
penetrating and like all the comments
were like man you need to look away once
in a while blink once in a while I was
trying guys okay I can see that but when
shows a more conversational format so
this is one of those things where sorry
guys we will really get to topics
relatively quickly today but we're sorry
we look the show is having a
conversation ok so it's one of those
things where it's context dependent so
depending on what type of video it is
sometimes it's really important to
maintain eye contact the whole time like
when I was working on the video this
week about the red mags that was the
kind of video where because I am having
a conversation with the person across
the table from me who just happens to be
a camera it's important to maintain eye
contact because guys we're trying to
have a real chat here we're trying to
demystify something especially if it's a
more sensitive video like after your I
don't know iPhone 10 or something review
when you you made a subsequent video
was like look we kind of screwed up in
these ways I didn't want the video to
come out the way it did come out and
you're having like a frank discussion
with the audience yes it's important to
maintain eye contact it's just it's a
matter of respect whereas when you are
like with your like if you can imagine
something that was like more of a like a
narrative type contact content where the
characters are interacting with each
other and it's like hi James it sure is
a pleasure to be here today
right Linus I can't wait to have a show
where we actually talk about tech so
it's all it's all context dependent so
we do have a bunch of great topics for
you guys today
Amazon accidentally sold thirteen
thousand dollar-plus camera gear for a
hundred dollars on prime day which
wouldn't be much of a win show topic
there wouldn't be a lot of discussion
there except that I can actually talk
about my experience being on the other
end as opposed to the consumer who got a
great deal being the product manager who
accidentally priced something for 1/10
of what it was supposed to be so we'll
discuss that we've also got neural link
Elon Musk's brain interface company
applying to the FDA for human trials I
already have mine he wants to wear that
World's Greatest Dad shirt look about
the world's first and the second
greatest there are some people in this
office that find that t-shirt offensive
like if you got one for me too and we
both wear I didn't if we were Co World's
Greatest Dad I might feel slightly less
personally attacked there's only one
greatest one goat and we're also gonna
cover facebook's finally getting the
fine of five billion dollars well
actually they're not but that's the
announce time I'm out yeah it still
hasn't gone through but five billion the
number of matters roll the intro Leandro
it's lagging apparently again I don't I
just don't get it I am we streamed for
half an hour on the test
yeah please do because this is getting
ridiculous
like we can't be using this exact
computer to stream on the test channel
and then that doesn't make any sense for
those of you watching on YouTube we
would strongly recommend home heading
over to twitch.tv slash Linus tech yes I
can I can do that if YouTube can't
figure out their live streaming then
people can go watch on Twitch the stream
is fine over there
so we're multi-streaming we did a half
an hour long test on our other channel
and it was fine so honestly I don't know
what to tell you guys we have no idea
what the problem is but it's clearly not
our internet clearly not our restreaming
service because that's working to twitch
on this one and to our test YouTube
channel and so yeah we don't know we've
got the settings identical between them
it's apparently only some people so
there's people in chat that are saying
there's no legs so all I can tell you
guys is if you are experiencing leg
twitch.tv slash Linus tech we're also
having some leg issues on floatplane
those are unrelated those are floatplane
related we have to change from nimble
video streamer to a different one
because basically there's too many of
you now we have to make something new so
thanks so much for your support
all your friends but get them to trickle
in yeah Luke's gonna have some really
cool floatplane news next week but for
now I think the best thing that we can
do is jump right into our highlight
topic for the week which is of course
the pricing errors on Amazon's prime day
this isn't something you noticed when
you guys were doing your prime day
stream no it wasn't did you cover any
camera gear no we didn't so this is
supposed to by RC mail
I think is high pronounced I'd like to
do the hell just for the record yeah you
have one of the my most hated names on
the forum I do know this could you stop
why won't you stop attacking me
Europe you're a bad dad yeah you have a
crap name on a bad dad you're just not
the world
this anymore for three weeks now you
hate RC Bay Hills I've been doing the
wind doc for like a year and a half or
something like that or maybe even two
years and this person posts all the time
and I still have to spell and like look
and spell the name it just makes no
sense in my mind I can't remember how to
spell it ever so thanks dude maybe it's
RC may HL you know like maybe we're
missing something here anyway do you
want to run us through what happened so
on prime day some users not everybody
but some people saw weird prices for
lots of different camera gear so this is
on the same item like two different
people would see a different price for
the same item they all saw the same
price yeah but it wasn't the intended
price got it so it started out on one
item in particular and then people
noticed that it was actually on lots of
different items and it was always the
price of 94 dollars and 48 cents right
and then so there's a forum that a lot
of these like deal seekers use called
slick deals slips a little been around
forever actually you can get slick deals
over there the slickest you know what's
funny I'm gonna totally derail you here
yes I would like that we had thought
about create you know how Linus tech
tips doesn't have an award program like
we don't have like like a loyalty
program no not a rewards program we
don't have an award program like when we
review something oh yeah won't be like
four and a half stars out of five
recommend to buy and like we don't have
like a little badge design for that
I just don't know it's always felt kind
of silly to me and we don't do it but we
had considered doing it one at one point
just because we had the best possible
names for what the awards would be so
Luke and I were each gonna have separate
ones
and it was gonna be already in there was
gonna be this list okay Linus's likes
with like a thumbs up like modeled after
our Facebook style thing and then slicks
deals oh that's pretty good so we
figured like okay if we were gonna have
an award program it would have to be
cringy like that but then we just kind
of never got it off the ground anyway
carry on yes slick deals it's a website
yeah they posted on the forum there and
then it kind of spread and lots of
people got in on it apparently a lot of
people made orders
and some people's orders have been
fulfilled so some people realize that
they are getting slick deals and tried
to make the best of it like there was
this one guy he bought like $10,000
worth of stuff for $900 worth of real
money and then Wow some of it got to
live got actually delivered to him but
what happened was Amazon itself with a
completely separate system flagged his
credit card because they thought someone
was was using it maliciously like just
you've never bought ten cameras before
so they shut it down so only some of the
stuff in his cart are I think maybe
maybe he did it one order and then he
made a new cart and then that one
wouldn't didn't get fulfilled so he got
kind of stymied for a different reason
but yeah some people got off with etana
sweet year so there's things like sony
a6000 kits a 6500 s 10 to 18 millimeter
bundle a $2,000 sony a7 body 2900 all
this stuff apparently there was like a
$13,000 big one of those giant lenses
that people use to zoom in on birds all
this stuff for like $94 holy crap I mean
to be clear though the person talking
about the $13,000 lens wrote that oh no
another member wrote regarding their
canon EF oh no this is 800 millimeter
yep waiting for the cancellation but
that's like 99% off others reported that
they successfully price matched gear at
retailers like Best Buy crazy
so that is crazy because I have seen
other times where on I think it was them
like a Boxing Day thing yeah where
someone had a crazy deal and then the
other local retailers just said no we're
not doing it it's too crazy yeah
wouldn't order they wouldn't match it
even though it was their policy so going
back to my days as a product manager at
an online retailer one of my one of my
big mistakes early on in my career as a
product manager was actually on a
mountain mods case I remember it pretty
well and I was pretty new to the product
management team I only had basically the
only product lines that
I was allowed to handle were the ones
that were not really worth anyone else's
time like they were either very high
touch some very very time-consuming with
a lot of like nitpicky stupid crap or
very low margin or like completely
deadlines that someone else had like
just abandoned and just didn't feel like
dealing with anymore so they just kind
of got shed over to me that's how you
get baptized in fire pretty much like I
started out trying to make a name for
myself with water cooling and like weird
fringe vendors and mountain mods was one
of them so here I'm just gonna turn my
screen here so Mountain mods actually
still exists and it's really funny that
case labs made so much noise about how
their designs got ripped off by
Thermaltake because to my knowledge now
I could be wrong correct me in the chat
but as far as I know Mountain mods has
been around a heck of a lot longer than
case labs and they are the original cube
case I feel like if there's some kind of
like tech like the force like Star Wars
force you can sense all the keyboards
around the road clacking right now to
try to investigate this for us someone's
gonna have an answer I know right so
Mountain mods it was one of their
ascension cases I think basically
they're like kind of a modular case
maker and a big problem for them was
that their shipping prices into Canada
sucked donkey balls so any Canadians
that wanted to buy a mountain mods case
couldn't really get one at a reasonable
price because they're already super
expensive because they're made in the US
still to my knowledge including the
actual metal fabrication and powder
coating looks heavy and they are heavily
kind of customizable they're actually
not that heavy they're aluminum so
they're heavily customizable they're big
and they ship free assembled so they're
like freakin huge and all the
accessories are like super expensive and
there's all these different options and
shipping cross border was a little bit
tougher back then man there's
it still sucks okay there we go okay so
let's just grab like a u2 u2 UFO is kind
of like their og case that's changed a
lot over the years but I'm willing to
bet the pictures on here are from like
the N Force two days like it really
wouldn't surprise me how slow this
frickin cytus know you guys might be
love hugging it right now what does that
mean love hugging it like I bring it up
and then everyone like goes to their
site just to like check it out and it's
not used to that kind of traffic because
they're this super weird little niche
vendor so anyway yeah these are like 360
to $400 cases and as soon as you start
adding some accessories like you know a
dual power supply mount or like a fancy
grill for your radiator or whatever the
case may be they get really expensive
and part of the other problem with them
is that because they're highly
customizable so when you click on one of
the cases you'll have all these
different options for like different
motherboard trays and different drive
mounts and all that kind of crazy stuff
it was a really really child here
finally bringing it back really
challenging line for me to manage
because unlike a Corsair case where it's
like this is a 580 X it comes with all
the things that 580 X comes with and is
compatible with the things of 580 X is
compatible with I had to kind of pre
make the decisions for our customers
what color what finish of that color
what mounting options in order to kind
of try to have something that is
pre-configured in our warehouse that
makes sense and if I made a bad gamble
like if I decided that we wanted UV
orange acrylic windows then if we were
stuck with dead stock of that I had to
go rip all those UV orange ones order
some clear ones put them on myself like
no one was gonna help move this crap
because they all thought it was a total
waste of time
ultimately carrying Mountain mods was
actually a total waste of time we didn't
end up making a ton of money on it but
you know we tried Bottari mountain moms
and they're cool guys like just to be
clear I actually had Mountain mods even
after we weren't really buying case
from them anymore I had them powder coat
my case for my personal rig because I
just absolutely love their powder coat
finish it's just it's fantastic was that
available to everybody you could just
send yours in and they would finish it
and send it back I have no idea they did
it for you it for me though nice hey
yeah I'm all about I'm all about working
the angles and I was just like hey so uh
if I'd like disassembled I don't like
your cases that much I like my case I
really like your paint finish can I send
it to you and they did it for me it
looks beautiful to this day actually
still have that case in mothballs in
case I ever don't have like a rack
mounted gaming machine I'll probably go
back to it now can you speak to the
other side of this issue in terms of
when we see this and the the spin that
all these articles have is that this was
a cool freak occurrence where you could
get this stuff super cheap which is
amazing for anyone involved who got to
be there
and got to buy stuff super cheap and
anyone who missed out is super regretful
oh but no one talks about the
perspective of the retailer who's like
mater we just lost a lot of money this
was a five hundred dollar case Canadian
our cost because the US dollar was
actually quite a bit stronger against
the Canadian dollar at that point in
time so what happened was I wanted to
price it and I think I was even trying
to blow them out like I was trying to
get rid of them so I had them at I think
for $99.99 or something like that so
you're just trying to break even and
liquidate these I'm just trying to flip
them so I accidentally put a decimal in
the wrong place now it's funny we
actually ended up developing a system
later on down the line that would
highlight red highlight yellow and then
highlight red anything that was marked
10 or 20 like some some percentage I
think was a yellow if it was below cost
and then red if it was significantly
below abnormal I can fly it so it'll so
that you'll visually see it on your
sheet and you can go to a manual double
check but that system didn't exist up
until that time
apparently they called it the Linus
system yeah everyone else who had worked
there before that just never made
boneheaded entry errors but anyway I
accidentally entered four
9.99 9 mm-hmm and the system did manage
to autocorrect that I had an extra
truncate of the extra nine and then it
was 50 bucks and it was 50 bucks for a
500 dollar case now there were because
it was such a weird niche item like if
we had accidentally priced a hard drive
or a CPU or something like volume I
demand a high volume item at 10% of the
price we would have noticed immediately
because like our servers would have gone
down you know we would have had 10,000
people on the site trying to order that
friggin thing so you're saying this was
a silent killer
no unnoticed for weeks no no we noticed
the next day because every order at NCIX
at that time was actually like that the
credit-card processing was manually
reviewed by a team of people so they
went through brought it to the CEO
instead of coming and talking to me
about it
thanks doctor no you know who you are
brought it straight to the CEO instead
of coming and talking to me about it
first and was like hey what's up with
this we're losing four hundred and fifty
dollars an order on on this item what is
this does this seem like sound business
to you so I get so so here's kind of the
dark you know the other side of this so
I get called into the president's office
I am a very junior product manager at
this point I probably haven't made
$5,000 for the compass point and we've
got ten orders oh really
now it wasn't nearly as bad as it could
have been because someone actually had
seen it the night before and pulled it
out of the sale and I don't even know if
we had ten units in stock but basically
it was it was five grand which to me to
a lot of people I think is a lot of
money right five thousand dollars a lot
of money sure and he kind of he looks
like sit down
and he goes so here's what here's the
situation what are we going to do about
this and I was like are you asking me I
don't know what are we gonna do about
this and I was like I'll call them and
I'll explain I'm sorry we can't do that
our bad
and he's like no we're gonna honor it
we're gonna eat it this time but that's
your training budget for the year don't
do it again
and I kind of went so so even if you
didn't have ten in stock so you had
seven in stock yeah you ordered the
other three and fulfilled them if those
ones could have been easily canceled if
I recall correctly the ones we didn't
have in stock we cancelled the orders
but the ones that we did have in stock
we ate it yeah so I think we had close
to however many we sold and apparently
this gear was being sold and shipped by
Amazon so I actually would have been
Amazon and eating this and then Amazon
employee getting the talk like that you
had it so I guess here is you know
you'll you'll hear a lot of people talk
about these kinds of pricing errors from
a very I would say selfish perspective
they'll say well yah maybe you're
something to me about mistake thunder to
which I would respond okay what's your
job
are you a I don't know are you a
construction worker are you a drywall
derp are you a chef are you uh you know
whatever whatever it is if you were to
make a mistake that's that easy to make
if you were to put a nail into the wrong
spot remember you are just a cog in the
machine I'm not saying that you run the
company because in our case the CEO was
in a position to make a decision like
let's lose $5,000 today you know so
you're just a cog in the machine if you
were to put a nail in the wrong spot
three inches to the right
should you just lose $5,000 I'm talking
about the triviality of the error that
was made and the total consequences so
you know on the one hand yes advertising
a false price is bad and actually in
many cases illegal but in this case I
would argue that in some ways the
consumer knowing that that price is
obviously not correct and predatory alee
ordering something is not in the right
either even though their action is
completely legal I would say it is not
really ethical sure but there's yeah
everyone knows that you know everyone
feels down this term of late late stage
capitalism capitalism is great it's the
most successful distributions like
wealth distribution system we've ever
invented
but there are some dark sides of it that
result in oligopolies and and all sorts
of other things and silo wheeling of
wealth and stuff like that and I think
because those dark sides of capitalism
exist when things like this happen in
favor of consumer I'm kind of just like
yeah today it worked for me yeah do two
wrongs make a right I mean that becomes
I think a bigger debate at a certain
point do you think there's anyone who
benefited from this sale who would go ah
you know what cancel the order this I
don't deserve this $5,000 camera well I
think they would say yeah go ahead well
okay I think it takes a particular type
of person to go and like again you know
when I talk about being predatory I'm
not talking about ordering the $500
camera for $100 that's maybe believable
you know you might not even look that
closely at it you might think it's it's
a it's a B stock one the $13,000 lens
for $94 yeah or or going and ordering
placing six or seven separate orders
trying to get as many of them as you can
and like ultimately that is it's not
stealing because someone is voluntarily
giving it to you but I'm gonna go ahead
I'm gonna say something super
controversial and I'm gonna say by the
same logic you know the the settlers
here in North America didn't steal land
from the Native Americans then because
they in many cases gave it up
voluntarily not realizing or
understanding what the deal they were
making was like I would make the
argument that that retailer or that
provider of product didn't know that
that was what was happening and that's
clearly predatory well it's a little
different cuz this is probably an error
but as a parent if you found out that
your kid got was one such person that
got the thirteen thousand dollar lens
first you would make you'd have a
toddler and make them turn it yep
interesting sucks view your kids is
there a line where like okay if they get
the five hundred dollar one for a
hundred dollars
yes that's kind of justifiable yeah to
me it's believable if they get one
that's like two thousand dollars for a
hundred dollars you're making them
return it but if they get something
extreme that you're like okay don't tell
anybody that's crazy you just keep it
like if they find a duffel bag of like a
billion dollars several dog track if
they finally get a duffel bag of money
that's like three million dollars in it
you're like okay just don't tell anybody
let's just move see that's the thing
okay it's still unethical but if I found
a duffel bag of money on the street I've
actually I've actually thought about
this I have theory crafted this for
myself if I found a duffel bag of money
on the street I'm gonna use an arbitrary
number but let's say it has five million
dollars in it and I'm talking Canadian
rupees so it's not like you know what no
let's say five million US okay five
million US dollars now my first instant
a second yeah can we just do it then you
have to fence US dollars to Canadian
stuff can we just make it whatever your
home currency is you find a bunch of
money okay fine you find five billion US
dollars equivalent in your home currency
so for us that's about six and a half
million dollars okay good
thank you very much so okay I find five
million dollars in a bag now my first
instinct is actually fear yeah sure why
is this here who's watching it you know
I open it cuz I'm like you know let's
say I open it because I'm earnestly
trying to return it to the owner right
and I open it I'm like holy crap it's
full of money there's no identifying
information in it whatsoever right so
you are supposed to turn it in to the
police that's what you're supposed to do
is that law I believe so yes you have to
give it to them to give whoever lost it
some reasonable amount of time to claim
it and then after that I believe
theoretically it's supposed to be
forfeited back to you but I think in the
cases of very valuable or very large
sums of cash that might not necessarily
be the case and it might just go to the
crown well you're so you can be
relatively sure that it's laundered
money or dirty money anyway you can be
relatively sure of that yes so with that
in mind even though it's unethical I've
thought about this actually I got a
plane right I'm pretty sure my course of
action I was like lying awake one night
I couldn't sleep doesn't matter the
point is I'm pretty sure this is what I
do I would take it home and I would bury
it somewhere just I would just bury it
and I would wait for some very long
period of time if someone came looking
for it I'd want to have it all because I
don't know who's showing up for it could
be cops could be drug dealers could be
human traffickers no idea but whoever
they are I I want some kind of credible
plausible deniability story about how I
was I was keeping it safe and trying to
get in touch with whoever owned it here
you go go away please never talk to me
again you probably get beat up but they
might yeah okay okay so after some
period of time let's say eighteen months
two years got to keep it I'd keep it it
would be unethical and I would know it's
unethical but given who
the victim was we're not talking some
random blue-collar worker who's just
trying to do their job we're talking
probably drug dealers and human
traffickers or whatever we're gonna five
million dollars in a duffel bag there's
no legitimate reason for that to exist
given who the victim is yeah it's good I
don't care it's a good plan I like it I
don't know that I would go to my house
first
I might just drive around
I don't know okay you know what actually
that's I'm not gonna be like oh now that
you say that yes I did think of that I
actually did I had considered that I
would I would want to make sure I didn't
have a tail but but I would end up at my
house eventually and I would bury it at
my house would you pick it up right away
or would you just go and sit down on a
bench it within eyeshot oh I would pick
it up right away
I'd pick it up right away for sure but
then what I would do is I would pick it
up right away and I would wait nearby
with it so that way if someone were to
show up and I'd be like sitting on my
phone or something if someone were to
show up I'd be like oh yeah I totally
noticed that this was very weird and I
was looking in the news to see if like
who it might go back to and I was I was
about to call the police here you go
we're super cool right bye mm-hmm like I
would I would pretend that I was at
least making so naive playing dumb
yeah just told me playing dumb there's
not a bad bet well how did we get on
this you got one of those cameras I say
keep it you're a good person I remember
when I was you know in university when
terabyte hard drives were first coming
out there was an error like that I
forget what company it was but they were
going for like 60 bucks or something
like that which was a steal at the time
and yeah I regretted not being able to
cash in on it okay but remember - that's
that 60 bucks like it's somewhat
credible and besides there's a
difference between ordering one and
ordering 20 so actually yeah one smarter
so pricing errors would happen fairly
often at NCIX and I can tell you right
now if you're the guy that orders one we
were far more likely to let it go and if
you were the guy that orders ten we were
far more likely to tell you to
go cram it up your butt you get nothing
because the thing that you got to
understand is in any case like this it's
always a judgment call and they're gonna
make a decision case by case basis how
much was this our fault how much is our
total overall loss how much of a
complete a hole is this particular
individual being about it
like if someone came to us and was like
threatening right am I supposed to drink
out of this you can't if you want good
well it's not mine
oh it's Britain its brand new oh yeah
right for launching a new device in here
take Oh new water bottle there's ice in
this yeah they don't come with ice yeah
they don't come to face they don't come
with bath water either thankfully so
this is the new limited edition I don't
know we might make more them you never
know but we didn't do that many of them
but this is the stealth line is tech
tips water bottle so gone is the orange
logo in is the matte black logo what's
actually kind of a glossy black but the
whole thing so this is the design that I
was like yeah do this one yeah sweet so
we decided to do both we did the orange
one first and then we just had them the
orange ones are selling so well that we
were like okay let's do more orange ones
and what the hey
let's do a stealth one too so ltte
store.com you guys are gonna want to
check that out it's the same process the
other highlights tell all right I forgot
about that okay so this week is the
stealth bundle I don't have to actually
give them an offer code do I
automatically applied so all you got to
do is scroll right past the underwear or
buy that too and go ahead and add to the
cart the stealth hoodie and your size of
choice
god damnit how cute is colton the a
stealth water bottle which we'll have
pictures shortly but it looks like this
you guys saw it and the LTTE hats in
black which I love and bippity Boppity
Boppity boo boom you get the Hat for
free so there's no indication that this
bundle exists until you make it yourself
in your car you might call it a stealth
yep
so it'll automatically apply to your
cards so guys Oh what the heck
dang it you guys should try to put other
things in your cart and see what happens
you never know merch might just show up
at your house stupid kids they play with
my they play with the strings on my
hoods pull them out see even though it's
no there's a knot in it so it's not
gonna come out easily but they are
always screwing around
we have preventive measures for this I
know we thought of this in the design
but they like your kids foiled you work
hard at it I don't have a red hat I only
have the black ones this is pretty nice
anyway so yeah it's the hoodie that I'm
wearing right now which can be
configured with the strings even but you
know your mileage may vary on that so
this one with the phone pocket and the
water bottle pocket does not have a
water bar where the heck's my phone yeah
you does have a water bottle pocket yeah
so it's got the phone pocket I wouldn't
actually recommend putting a water
bottle that'll stretch it um this is my
hoodie hoodie so it's this one it's the
black on black hat and it's the black on
black water bottle add all those to your
cart and you will get $20 off which is
basically the price of the Hat and so
it's kind of like getting a free hat
it's so like unusual that I love this
hat because usually when I try on a hat
for some reason robes my head shape or
whatever but I get these weird creases
like right here in here yeah these ones
they're just perfect great for covering
up your greasy hair which is uh most of
the bad today most of the week I mean
I'm going I'm going with my hair today
I'm not much of a Haggai everyday but I
burn in about eight minutes outside so I
actually do wear it like when I wear
that hat and a hoodie you my wife says
that I look like I'm from abbotsford
abbotsford what does that even mean as
opposed to Vancouver I guess I don't
know um
nearly what's this other shirt you have
on oh okay are we doing sponsor let's do
spot you know what thought we were
monsters now LTX 2019
baby it's gonna be flippin sick this is
my staff shirt Wow
I got staff really excited I mean look
if we're pimping everything I might as
well job like yeah god we've got the
underwear now - yeah yeah I actually got
our first customer feedback on the
underwear already no yeah yeah someone
tagged me in a status update on the
forum Pacis you tight and yeah sure
James yeah they they message me on the
forum they were like wow I can't believe
I got it so fast cuz we watched it a
couple days ago they got it yesterday so
they got it basically immediately where
they were like yeah I'm actually not
sure and I couldn't share that
information anyway but I guess I could
if it was vague enough yeah I don't know
I don't know where they gonna in Canada
in the US no idea but they got it
already and they're ordering two more
two more apparently they're like yeah I
love it that's saying a lot
you're having nine pairs of underwear
that's like getting me probably gonna be
half of this person's whole repertoire
of underwear yeah I mean if they do
weekly laundry maybe their whole one and
yeah they were just like yeah I ordered
one as a test and I'm ordering two more
they're they're freaking awesome love
them and that's saying a lot especially
when you consider that they're $50 $50
us for a three packs or excuse me for
three pairs that's not just nice Orban
it there are lots of speaking Canadian
dollars wish I feel like buying power
wise is probably the same like if you're
in the u.s. you buy $20 underwear
probably hurts you the same as $20
underwear in the in Canada yeah if you
find good underwear that's $22 that's
like a good deal cuz there's a lot of
boxers that think they should be worth
$35
it depends what you're used to cuz if
you're like a Lululemon shopper oh yeah
my whole drawer then for the - yeah $22
underwear probably doesn't shock you
whereas a Lululemon ones are $22 a $25
that's why they're so wicked and then
but if you're a Hanes shopper yeah and
you buy you know a 30 pack of underwear
for ten bucks at like you know Costco
look even the cheap brands are more
I'm exaggerating yeah I'm exaggerated
I'm just saying if you buy like you know
Acme Acme you know palette of under what
are they actually they're like six
dollars a pair I have no idea the lot I
have the last time I bought underwear
was my wife buys my underwear I don't I
don't know how much underwear costs all
I know is what I did in terms of like
price comparison for these and the
material quality is more comparable to
your twenty five to thirty five dollar
per pair underwear and our pricing is
more like fifteen sixteen dollars a pair
16 and a half dollars a pair so I feel
like yes they're expensive but also
they're not unreasonable and it's part
of it is just the brand that we're
trying to build for the merch is like
look it's unapologetically not cheap but
it's also not basic like it's nice
you'll like it I'm trying it on how much
does underwrite tight underwear and
Costco calm and the first thing that
comes up is depends your screens not
sharing with me for some reason oh wait
you're using your laptop instead of the
second stream lab I didn't even know
that that laptop that the second stream
laptop can share well yeah I can here we
go $15 for champion men's boxer briefs
five pack okay three dollars a pair so
that's really cheap that's cheap
we are literally five to six times the
price of that wow that train is really
loud when the base open isn't it that is
that is fantastic
that's your underwear rolling out to a
mailbox near you do people like yeah
under bright colors are there any colors

doesn't know that a Nintendo switch
there's another Nintendo switch but also
there isn't it's it's the same Nintendo
switch but different by a Nintendo
switch
tip now yes or hold on is it now no it's
not mid-august mid-august if in mid
August you by Nintendo's yes and a past
version of you in the present now bison
Nintendo switch you will about two
different Nintendo switches yes unless
you get old stock and the future you
gets old stock and then that's a bummer
so you're in mid-august buying a
Nintendo switch yes which happens to
have been on the shelf
since you might at least today yes that
sucks because the new ones are gonna
have improved battery life pretty
significantly improved
the current ones are on shelves right
now they claim battery life of two and a
half to six and a half hours which is a
big range but it goes up from pretty
decent to like depending on the game and
how hot it is yeah and all sorts of
stuff the new ones are gonna have four
point five to nine hours so that's like
on the low end of the new switches the
lowest end according to this claim yeah
is like in this 66th percentile of the
old ones yeah that's pretty good and
you're not gonna pay anything more for
that that's just gonna be the new
standard switch so the the word on the
street if you hang out on sites that
really follow like silicon news closely
is that this is because they had to do
on like basically they were just doing a
new spin because they needed to move to
a new process or they needed it for the
switch light or something like that like
and since they were doing it anyway they
might as well just put it in the
full-size switch and then they can have
better battery life like basically it's
a power consumption decreasing move that
they've done here they got a different
battery yeah it's not a different
battery they have altered the power
consumption of the processor in the
Nintendo switch so they figured out what
the hey we're doing it anyway we might
as well put it in the switch the product
model number doesn't even change this
will have better battery life even than
the switch light yeah which has better
battery life than the old one well I
would think then just for the flick has
the switch light is small so I would
think for the full-size switch they're
just putting the same battery as the
original one and it just happens to be a
bigger one than the light yeah but they
would have needed this more power
efficient chip in order to make the
switch light have a reasonable battery
life at all while also being quite a bit
smaller right the rumor at this point is
that an enhanced version of the switch
targeted at avid gamers is also in
production but Nintendo has not
indicated that this is the case as of
yet with that said based on this new
manufacturing process if they were to
produce a more powerful chip and target
2.5 to 6.5 hours of gameplay like the
original switch maybe they could do a
switch Pro or a switch where you think
they would call it
Wow there are other Nintendo consoles
that have had iterations like that bro
monikers have they ever done like a DS
pro well they did lots of different
versus advanced with Game Boy and SP but
what about on actual consoles like a 64
yeah I mean they'd be like a Super
Nintendo Super switch Super Nintendo
wasn't just an iteration there's a whole
new yeah like Nintendo's naming four
things are so weird cuz like one time
that they have maintained inter console
compatibility was with the Wii and the
Wii U so what switch you but that was a
complete failure don't say that anymore
you know if it was anyone else you know
I'd be like switch GT like that would be
a more conventional North American thing
to do or like a switch st you know where
the suffix on it yeah yeah but I can't
see a Nintendo doing that it's just not
really they should just put another ass
the switch to the SS yes okay I wouldn't
put anything past them they came the
console where you grab a thing like this
and wave it around the we like it's I've
never heard anyone make that Association
really yeah you've never heard anyone
make the association between the Wii and
a penis and saying we like together no
what no I never heard that no no not not
doing it together I know but you're
saying I thought you meant we oh we like
w ee yeah oh no I haven't heard that I
think I shot up yes not joking no I
don't believe you right now man I'm
younger than you that's I was like 14
when that came out and I seen you
weren't making P and Weiner Jo no no you
were above that you heard it here first
guys James James has matured as a human
being in a very unusual fashion you see
this he starts see this he started out
with a very very high brow
sense of humor and then he's decorated
from there no loud children I only have
the shirt do you think as a company like
does Nintendo have to get these old
soon-to-be inferior switches off the
shelves before they can like if you buy
one before the new one comes out is
there a period of time where you can
exchange it like honoring the sale price
so I think the store is just gonna end
up eating it and they might send it back
to Nintendo and Nintendo might have some
kind of B stock way to dump old
inventory Oh like I'm sure this it's not
I mean it's if there's anything they
learned from the Wii U don't call
something something you and how to get
rid of dead stock so I'm sure they can
figure it out okay but yeah if I was a
retailer and I ended up taking back a
bunch of crappy battery life switches I
would I'd probably just send them back
to Nintendo me look this your problem if
you want me to keep carrying your
product I'm not eating these all right
neural Inc applies to the FDA for human
trials so near link a company set up by
Elon Musk to explore ways to connect the
human brain to a computer interface has
applied to US regulators to start
trialing its device on humans okay that
sounds really click Beatty so near link
is a you wrote it I copy/paste it it's a
brain machine interface company with the
ultimate eventual goal of making an
interface that you can connect
non-intrusive lee to the brain so we can
you don't have hard drives for for
memory and and and basically keep this
keep up with the AI that's gonna make us
their pets so be a cyborg but in Elon
Musk fashion he usually shoots for the
moon but makes him monetizable path to
get there right so if he wants to go to
Mars he starts doing he makes his own
Space Shuttle and then brings people
just to the ISS and makes money doing
that so you can finance the eventual
trip to Mars and research all the
technology along the way so what they're
doing with neural link is the same thing
there apparently according to their
claims they've already surpassed the
state-of-the-art and they're trying to
make these brain machine interfaces that
can help people like with Parkinson's
and other neurological diseases just not
have seizures anymore
and stuff like that and
then once they continue to do that
eventually the technology be good enough
that you and I don't need to use a
keyboard and mouse anymore so they
showed off some of the aspects of their
new tech which is the first device is
called the n1 and mostly the talk was a
recruitment talk kind of it was a
conference Elon wasn't the only one
speaking there as other people of the
team they showed clips of different
people at the team with footage from
their loud apparently they have 100
employees really I thought it was like a
team of like the 12 best experts in the
world but there's like a hundred people
there Wow okay and it's super cool so
what it is is basically a small chip
like smaller than the size of your pinky
fingernail and that goes just underneath
the skull in like a two millimeter wide
incision it's such a small incision that
you don't even need a stitch when they
when it's over they want the operation
to be like getting LASIK eye surgery and
yeah kind of like that kind of like
installing the chip in a Kingsman
Lindsay oh okay so I think you'd like it
attached to the chip is a bunch of these
like probes but they're they're threads
okay they're not like like the the stuff
that people buy today which is super
expensive and brutal it would be like a
spike that goes into your brain and
instead they have these threads so there
are actually a tenth of the width of a
human hair and they go in and each one
of them has electrodes in it and so it
can receive signals from multiple
neurons and then all those stars are
connected to that chip that chip then
communicates wirelessly to a wearable
that you put on your ear which in turn
is connected by a bluetooth to your
smartphone I must be getting old because
this makes me very uncomfortable oh
that's so cool and so you can actually
wear more than one of these so normally
this like the the state of the art that
they use before like that spike you just
get one and it'd be like super invasive
and everything yeah but these because
they're less invasive they could put
they want to aim for about four but you
can put up to ten in different brain
centers around your head and your hair
can just grow back over them and there's
no cords coming from use of it they're
super discreet
yeah and the thing that super cool is
they've made this robot to do the
surgery to put it on because those
threads are so fine and small smaller
than a human hair this robot with this
tiny tiny needle and this machine vision
which can detect where you're like brain
your arteries are and veins in your
brain where the blood is it can avoid
those so it doesn't cause hemorrhaging
and it can it can just insert these
threads at different places and there's
like a thousand threads with like three
thousand electro DS oh and it doesn't
like in an hour
crazy yeah so I'm super surprised that
they apparently have a product that they
apparently are gonna be trying on humans
by apparently the end of 2020 they
tested it on a monkey that was able to
control a computer with its brain
according to mr. musk that's not
far-fetched because there's videos of
monkeys controlling computer the brains
like 12 years ago right but it just
means that their system like does
something at the very least it's not
just you know a Kickstarter yeah here's
a really thin thread we imagine at some
point in the future it'll detect neural
activity but for now it's just drilled
into your brain yeah I think they have
like the far most experts they have a
lot of young people a lot of people that
video look like they're under 30
interesting speaking of a lot of young
people a lot of young people are getting
off Facebook okay last one though
because I gotta go oh this is last one
that we highlighted at the beginning oh
yeah so I wanted to make sure we got
through those we're not doing the
Samsung Graham thing um all right so
this was posted on the forum by flu fur
thanks flu fur love that name US
regulators have approved a record five
billion dollar fine on Facebook to
settle an investigation into data
privacy violations related to
allegations that political consultancy
camera generally they can't properly
obtain the date of updating seven
million Facebook users the sum amounts
to around a quarter of the company's
yearly profit the investigation focused
on whether Facebook had violated a
twenty eleven agreement under which it
was required to clearly notify users and
gain express consent to share their data
if confirmed it would be the largest
fine ever levied by the FTC on a tech
but it still needs to be finalized by
the Justice Department Civil Division
and it's unclear how long this may take
investors responded positively to the
news : this is the most interesting part
yeah you'd think that the news of being
like hey you're gonna get fined five
billion dollars would make your stock
price go down but actually it made it go
up 1.8% which totally makes sense
because they knew that this fine is
coming down the pike for a long time
yeah but you didn't know how much it was
gonna be but Facebook did think that it
was gonna be in the neighborhood of five
billion and Facebook did put apparently
almost enough almost all that aside so
the reason the stock price would go up
is because now there's less uncertainty
right we don't know what additional
measures an oversight might be placed on
the company or Mark Zuckerberg himself
but I think what everyone wants to know
is where does the money go like does
everyone who had their information sold
you know we could get compensated for it
apparently in cases like this it's that
people affected don't get compensated
the agency that does the investigation
isn't even the one who gets the money
usually it just goes to the the US
Treasury for for general use so build a
wall yeah it just goes into the coffers
yeah sure do you think that some people
think that this is not enough money it's
a slap on the wrist it's not enough to
make a dent or make them care it is 20
percent of a year's profits not gross
revenue profits yeah so I actually I
have a bit of a different take on that I
think that a fine of 20 percent of a
company's profit for the year is much
more than a slap on the wrist I mean I
think it's very easy for people to say
well Facebook doesn't care because
they're gonna make four times that much
this year but I mean if I told you that
you know you did a really bad thing
driving that bar over the speed limit
I'm fining you a quarter of your salary
for the year you'd probably be pretty
bummed yeah the other part of it is they
have competitors all their competitors
are you know everyone's making as much
as I can and allocating as much as I can
to the future to grow more in the future
so if you didn't plan for that 20
percent that inhibits your ability to
grow
as you wanted to and then gives your
competitor as a leg up and the other
thing to remember is that this is just
one country that has assessed this 20%
of Facebook's global annual profit fine
there's nothing to say that they won't
get hit by and you know what this
Cambridge analytical one specifically
maybe not but there's nothing to say
that in the event of some kind of a
scandal like this that they won't get
hit then by the EU and then by Canada
then by someone else and at the end of
the day you know yeah
Facebook is gonna continue to make a lot
of money and ton of money but I I don't
personally buy that 20% of your annual
profit is and is like a slap on the
wrist if we got like okay if we got
fined
20% of our annual profit I can tell you
as a business owner that would sting
that would affect our budgeting that
would affect our future plans on our
expansion our growth especially because
this is sort of a Pandora's box now that
I've been fined five billion dollars
once I'm certainly at that amount twenty
percent of my profit I am certainly
trying to figure out how to not get hit
by that next year hmm
so if people are saying look this is not
a deterrent I think that's hogwash
you think Facebook wants 20 percent of
their profit wiped out every year that's
not gonna help their stock price I think
it's interesting that you know given
that a just goes to the US Treasury for
general use it almost gives the
government an incentive to make these
fines go through that's kind of weird
yeah
government finds our fascinating thing I
mean that's another thing too is like
for me as Facebook I have a lot of
uncertainty now it's like on the one
hand yeah you guys done goofed but you
know they've done a lot of other really
stupid stuff over the last couple of
years too so I'm kind of sitting there
going out crap now that their scent of
blood is in the water what else are they
coming after US foreign model defines me
like if I'm a facebook investor this
news does not make me want to spend 1.8%
more on
pictures especially because facebook is
such a public target I'm then again like
I I have to confess I haven't been
following this that closely you know
maybe there's something in this
settlement that says the FTC isn't gonna
go after them for anything else but like
I don't know exactly I don't know but
it's not confidence-inspiring for me and
I think it's I think it's sort of
ridiculous to think that Facebook would
just shrug this one off I agree
could be wrong super tots yeah super
chat good reminder thank you Chris nerdy
