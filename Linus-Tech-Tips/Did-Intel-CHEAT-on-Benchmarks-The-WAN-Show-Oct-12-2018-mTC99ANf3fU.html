gonna be a short land show today you
know what I was doing today no I was
installing a sound bar that took you all
day well I was installing a sound bar
with Alex oh and have you ever tried to
achieve something with Alex actually I
don't think so
it usually involves a drill okay okay
that makes sense I could see that so did
you guys go like way over and above
actually no no the sound bar was not not
crazy janky or anything like that the
more fun thing that we did is I don't
know if when you rolled into the office
today
you noticed that the super Civic kind of
moved I heard lots yesterday it was loud
yeah so the floatplane team had a little
viewing session through the window
yeah so we were working yesterday on
what I think may be the greatest video
that Linus Media Group really has ever
created Wow
so basically what happened was a
particular projector brand yeah reached
out wanting us to do a sponsored video
on a projector okay and the writing team
having learned our lesson from the the
fiasco that was the how nerds watch
sports ball video really put their heads
together to try to come up with a
concept that wouldn't get us completely
as the kids say wrecked in the YouTube
comments
okay and we came up with this one won't
look we came up with the idea because
here's the thing about projectors yeah
projectors are really good at one thing
a big picture in a darkroom I thought
you're gonna say projecting light okay
yeah projecting a big light picture in a
darker yeah and they are super mediocre
at best at everything else yeah and so
when you're trying to come up with a
unique spin on a projector it's like
coming up with
you know I was about to say it's like
coming up with a unique spin on socks
but actually coming up with the unique
spin on socks is pretty easily easier
you can put them on your feet you can
put them on your hand to go like this
you can wear sandals on top of them like
there's all kinds of different
legitimate ly use them as gloves if you
really need lots of different ways to
enjoy socks yeah
projector best enjoyed from the couch
popcorn in a dark room with a projector
screen and we've had it like dis rapport
tional e high amount of like brands that
make projectors approached us about
making unique content so you pretty much
name it we've kind of done it and yeah
we only really like to review projectors
like any when it's not sponsored because
we don't like to cross our streams there
as the as the kids say you know across
streams yeah um but we don't we don't
really like to review them when there
isn't something really different
technologically about them so when I see
a 4k 120 Hertz projector that has like
some kind of like superhuman DLP wheel
that spins faster than any DLP wheel
ever spun before then then that'll
probably merit a review okay just like
what we did with Adele has a really
unique projector it's a 4k laser
projector that's a super short throw so
you put it like 1218 inches from the
wall and you've got this gigantic really
sharp image cuz it's laser and stuff
cool yes sort of it's like hybrid laser
there's a DLP wheel involved if I recall
correctly anyway the point is it was
really different so we did a review on
that so the one that we were working on
for this it was it was different in the
sense that it's higher brightness
compared to most projectors of this type
which is great because higher brightness
means you don't have to have quite such
a darkroom in order to have a good
viewing experience but it wasn't like
fundamentally different technologically
so we weren't gonna be doing a review of
it and so we were like we were like okay
you know so far we've upgraded our board
room we've installed a projector in my
children's bed like that was that was
pretty out there which actually they
loved I took it down recently because we
changed the layout of their room but
they actually love having that up there
pretty cool um and we thought you know
what we haven't really seen a lot of in
the last you know a couple decades
drive-in theaters the drive-in theater
is kind of you know like a lost you know
art form I know of one yeah so only one
then we thought what if we took the
drive-in theater concept on the road
that's why it's okay so you guys are
gonna have to watch the video but let me
put it this way we organized a meet-up
for like like an experience of viewing
experience party of the portable
drive-in theater machine and four people
showed five if you count the guy who
owns the field oh my and yeah you guys
play molarity hilarity ensued we ended
up playing rocket League um Rick
Astley's never gonna give you up okay
and some of some of Brandon's beautiful
footage from it okay honestly rocket
League on a mobile set up off the front
of a car actually sounds super cool so
you're playing with controllers anyway
so you kind of sit wherever and I will
tell you this it was cold last night and
I was very happy to have a warm hood to
sit on so I'm sitting there in the
middle of a field right it's very
premium sitting there in the middle of a
field with a controller with this
gigantic like it's a 200 inch screen or
something 17 feet whatever that works
out to 17 foot we actually researches
yes we bought it we purchased I had no
idea we spent $200 of Linus Media
Group's hard-earned money so everyone's
sending super chats today you guys are
making up for the gigantic inflatable
projector screen that we bought
apparently well not yet not making up
for it yet yeah we got we got we got a
$10 super chet thank you thank you for
that Hellcat
Thank You Hellcat uh-oh great we should
probably get into like some topics for
the day we've got a lot of great topics
for you guys there was the made by
Google Hardware event there was also the
made by Razer Hardware event I actually
have my hands on the pixel three right
there the pixel three XL I've been
actually been spending most of my time
with the XL so far and I'm gonna go back
to it I'm just I'm having a weird issue
with it where it's not getting hangouts
notifications so I popped my sin in this
one so that I could see if it was just
isolated to that other unit and it does
appear to be isolated to the other unit
so I'm gonna have to figure out what the
crap is going on maybe just really
format and see what happens yeah not
only do I not get a notification but if
I open up unlock the phone open the
hangouts app I still won't get a
notification until I happened to open a
conversation thread with a person who
sent me a message in the time since I
got my last notification and then it
will spam me with every hangouts
notification I got from anyone else in
the meantime
oh jeez yeah it's like hilariously
broken never seen anything quite like it
yeah I'm trying to refrain I'm so
interested because this is gen 1 and is
starting to really show its age and I'm
in like looking for a new phone
territory but that one's really small
and the other ones not is very ugly yeah
it's like shoddy you remember not that
long ago we had a poll about like what
influences your smartphone purchasing
decisions right no I don't remember but
go ahead we had one on on Wednesday we
had a straw poll and like we we talked
about how like yeah probably more people
have have design influences than they
realize interest yet a lot of phones
just look really similar so it's not a
big deal but I didn't realize how much
that notch might influence me wow
there's a picture of on posted on
Twitter yeah univ on on the couch the
not from far away is really obvious what
the heck and they pull that out
i've seen i've seen an iphone XS and
it's not CH and it doesn't seem that
annoying to me but this like giant i
call it a fedora on twitter this giant
blah
key thing in the middle of your phone
it's just so weird you can see it from
here
so that's us on the couch and that's
been cocked like it looks like there's a
huge dent in the top of your phone yeah
wow yeah that's Kent that's a lot like I
don't know - have you seen the pictures
of the notch delete um were they black
out the notch area and then they put
your notification and stuff on just a
black bar so it looks like there's no
notch because there's just a big black
bar no I haven't seen that yeah but
between that and the gigantic chin bar
that they're only sort of gesture based
navigation gives you it feels like going
back to like an HTC One m7 yeah honestly
like in terms of the forehead and like
chin experience that I'm having using
that phone so what-what I know your
reviews not for a bit and you always
like spending more time with phones but
if you had to give like a short term
preliminary opinions um hold on a second
I actually didn't watch their keynote
yet I'll like watch it later
okay so I don't know the price how much
is the pixels I believe it's a hundred
to less than the iPhone holy crap
so it's Canadian oh that's Canadian okay
so hold on a minute so what like $7.99
or something I believe at $7.99 okay I'm
just gonna change this America we were
supposed to be going through the topics
for this today but I guess we're just
getting a little bit sidetracked here
phones
that's probably 464 ok so here we go
so $7.99 yeah so ah it's hard because
yeah it's really early on it's here I
always always lose track of pricing
because I'm Canadian and so I I things
in Canadian rupees but then I try to
speak in American dollars because the
majority of our viewers are American so
I always forget when I'm comparing
slicing yeah
yeah I actually know that's true not the
majority of our viewers are American we
actually have a ton from the UK now yeah
that really took off in the last like
couple of years here we go
all right so I'm just finding out how
much a note 9 is brand-new yes remember
my Troy how many times do I have to tell
it yeah that's always a lot of things to
figure this out yeah okay so 999 so it's
a $200 difference to a note 9 if Samsung
had a commitment to support their
devices with timely updates for three to
four years like Apple does yeah then my
answer would be very simple buy a note
nine or failing that in s nine plus
because I just yeah I just don't I don't
know and there's other wild cards in
there right now too so I actually have
the pixel three and the pixel three
Excel normally these days I review the
the Mini and the max version of phones
together I've been doing it for that way
for I think a couple of years now
yeah but I'm reviewing these two
separately Oh because they are
completely different phones just like
the pixel 2 and the pixel 2x over in the
sense that like every phone is very same
II these days these two are as different
from each other as any other phone is
from any other phone as far as I'm
concerned in terms of their design in
terms of the the experience of using
them they have things in common but in
that same way an iPhone and other more
different iPhone have a lot of things in
common but there are different phones
just to be clear all of the hardware is
the same right picture all the cameras
are the same I think two CPUs the same I
think the Rams the same as far as I know
but what I don't know based on the cuz I
haven't tested it yet is based on the
size of the chassis I don't know if the
performance is going to be the same
especially in things like gaming because
of thermal ok and you know modern modern
devices a batteries another big one and
modern devices are designed to thermal
throttle basically it's just a matter of
what the manufacturers tolerance was for
how much thermal throttling they want
when they want it to kick in how they're
balancing surface skin temperatures
versus the temperatures of the
processors inside like
they're really different devices so
pixel three pixel three excel razor
gaming phone to a csro gphin phone yeah
the polka phone f1 that's just off the
top of my head those are the phone
reviews that I still have to work on
right now so I I have a lot of work
today on season and the polka phone f1
is a really interesting one because that
one's only $2.99 and while the custom
rom sort of scene has kind of died down
a little bit since since Samsung in
particular fixed TouchWiz with the move
to Samsung experience yeah um it's kind
of popping up again around that phone oh
yeah the one plus 60 is coming
isn't there a company that essentially
it's not called cyanogen anymore but
isn't there a company that picked up the
cyanogen project dad I'm not sure I
heard about this I'm just not yeah I'm
not sure about that one but anyway the
poco phone f1 the community is kind of
springing up around that phone because
the skin on it is terrible like I have
the same kinds of issues that I did the
last time I reviewed a Xiaomi phone like
they're just not well optimized for the
North American user period and much
worse things than just like you have to
install Netflix manually using an apk
rather than through the Play Store like
it would feel like it's not compatible
through your device you go what do you
mean it's not compatible with my own
device it's ridiculous of course it is a
snapdragon 845 it's the same damn phone
as every other phones just with a
different you know shiny face on the
front so so where was I going with this
right so because the software experience
is so bad but the hardware is like
banging for the price it is similar
hardware to a top-tier samsung or talk
to your Google phone except a crappy er
camera right for $300 and the reality of
it is not everybody cares about their
smartphone's camera that much yeah so
it's very compelling so anyway that's a
video that I've been kind of been
working on for a while but I've decided
not to review with the stock skin so I
have never done that before
I actually intended with the mean mix
interesting to yes I think it was I
think it was me mixed to it was a show
me phone
I had intended to go ahead because I got
like a Chinese version of it and I had
wanted to install like like a more stock
Android experience type ROM like I had
wanted to go through the whole like
unlocking the bootloader
maybe it wasn't stock Android experience
maybe I just had had bought a Chinese
one and then I wanted to put a US ROM on
it and that wasn't supported yet but
then while I was in the process of
working on all this nonsense they
released a u.s. are like a global
version of it and I was like okay well
that work was all for nothing in any way
so I have never actually gone to the
lengths that of installing a different
skin like a different ROM on a phone
prior to reviewing it but for me the
poco phone f1 is a unique groans yeah
case yeah because it's unusable with the
stock skin in my opinion and if you can
add a very significant amount of value
yes that makes like to the point where
people should be doing that if they buy
I think of any kind of mod as how much
I'm paying myself to do the work yeah
and if I'm paying myself three dollars
an hour to install like to - you know
hack a game console or something you
know where there's realistically six
exclusives I wanted to play for that
console anyway and I could have bought
them all for $200 and this is like a
thirty hour mod that's like things like
that yeah that might break your thing
that I'm gonna run out and I'm gonna
have to get a new soldering iron for cuz
I need like you know like a high like a
high shoots like a high mass like I need
like a high mass soldering iron to make
sure that I can hit this high
temperature without affecting this other
nearby chipper like whatever whatever if
there's like all these hoops I'm jumping
through and I go no this is stupid I'm
just gonna go buy the games whereas if
it's if it's if it's a different type of
mod like if it's a four hour mod and I
can get you know 200 or 300 dollars of
value out of it I'm paying myself 50 60
65 dollars an hour well then I look at
it as something that I could reasonably
recommend to a viewer yeah and it's
worth the effort for me of going through
documenting this process and laying it
out for people so so that's why I want
to do it that way
people were pointing out to me after I
googled it but thanks guys
that is called lineage OS apparently
okay like new continuation so might be
interesting to look into honestly
something that's kept me from Samsung
for a long time I know there's been a
lot of interest in the note 9 but
something that's like strongly kept me
from Samsung is yeah I hate using their
it's better now it's a lot better now by
the way that weird hangouts glitch that
you saw where I got where my my
always-on display had Luke's message
from an hour ago was because I got a
different notification from Tyler that
he's purging the fridge right now you
were talking about that earlier in the
stream I just saw it happen why so I was
like what that's a different bug oh my
other bug is way worse okay I just won't
get a notification at all and what I
would have to do is I would have to go
and I would have to go into hangouts and
I would have to open like oh no your
chat and then all these other ones would
ping me at the same time really stupid
super annoying and the thing is like I
was talking to our debrand contact just
like we were just chatting over twitter
the other night and I was like yeah I'm
having these issues with the pixel 3 XL
and he was like lol it's what you get
for using hangouts and I'm like okay
look he's gonna be a hard time because
he's like that who was our D brain
contact I don't know his name is public
I'm not sure so I'm not staying here his
name but he's like lol you use hangouts
that's what you get and I was like ok
point taken but hangouts is part of the
G suite yeah which is an actual for
business product that I actually pay for
and it is a Google service that is
inexcusable and he's like lol yeah no I
know man I'm just I'm just razzing you
but I get I get kind of triggered
because I know it's not popular and I
know it has its issues it works pretty
good
it's I don't think it works yeah it has
definitely has its limitations it has
its limitations yeah but it is
cross-platform yeah and especially for
just like getting a singular person
attention for one like quick kind of
thing I think it's really good for that
yeah it's once you start getting into
big team chats and stuff I think you
start running into it no pretty heavy
limited then you start getting into
slack or discord land yeah and like
that's fine but the thing about hangouts
to is that because all of our work
accounts are Google I I have a guarantee
that if someone is just by logging into
their email they are getting hangouts
messages yeah at some point and it's all
in one place there are benefits to it
and it's really frustrating for me
because this Google service that I pay
for
and this Google device that I'm using
shouldn't be completely unworkable
together that's really ridiculous
yeah it's like when back in the day when
like a brand's power supply wouldn't fit
very well in their own case yes guys
what are you doing what an Tek an Tek
was like exactly ghosts are notorious
for that and like honestly it's probably
better now because they had a bit of a
dark time there for a bit and I say dark
time because I'm talking specifically
about the dark Fleetline up a bit that's
dark time I'm pretty meta because they
just had as far as I could tell no idea
what they were doing the DF 85 was
probably the worst designed case of its
time I'm serious
and they came out of like such a strong
era I'm serious right now
so DF 85 let's bring let's bring this
mess up this thing was just unbelievably
bad images I made a video about it like
way back in the day this first of all
that's what it looked like that was
never cool it's not cool now it wasn't
cool then it's bad it was always bad now
let's go ahead and enjoy the interior
design of this hope the kitties own hot
garbage so remembering that this was
only like six years ago when already
no-one was putting optical drives
certainly not three and whoever put like
eight three and a half inch tried except
hold on it gets
because you couldn't actually fit that
many three and a half inch drives
because they had these ginormous caddies
that were basically adapting whatever
this was to three and a half inch drive
bays and then this was this was during
the era of the GTX 480 so it had like
all this cooling which seems great in
theory the thing has seven 120
millimeter fan slots which is amazing
except that this stupid caddie
interfered with like standard length
Nvidia graphics cards so you could only
install like one it was just so bad and
get this see this thing right here this
is like a five and a quarter inch bay
cover except that it just has a little
plastic clip right here that just like
clips in here and then you could
actually reach the button of your
optical drive you could press the button
but then the drive would pop out and it
wouldn't actually open this thing I
would just get jammed up against it just
like open and close a couple of times
because it's confused it's like there's
a there's a blockage and there was no
there was literally no room for cable
management so you see this cut out for
the CPU cooler the amount of space back
there is negligible almost none this
thing was a complete cluster to build in
because these video cards barely fit the
cables had to be just like piled up down
here getting in the way of all this
airflow and like collecting dust it was
just all men so bad and was this the one
that had that stupid two and a half inch
dock in the top of it and remember this
is those were horrible this is at a time
when an SSD is like worth its weight in
gold yeah right there's like six seven
years ago it was supposed to be like a
gaming case like take it to a land party
you can put your SSD in the top for your
land party and I'm like are you nuts
people take locking cases to land
parties so that they don't get their
graphics card ripped out they're gonna
put their SSD right on the top in a
convenient little dock we can just rip
it right out are you kidding me and who
had an SSD for anything other than their
OS
why would you want that in a
conveniently removable dog you know
would be kind of an actually pretty cool
series of videos you
sure retro rents I'm calm I'm calm I'm
relaxed right now and some chill you'd
have to be not calm though like my Apple
watch is like breathe is it giving you
help noticing no it started taking
dictation Oh Apple watch my Apple watch
why was it why was it I don't know what
is it even doing
I love how useless my watch is right now
the Apple watches is really interesting
so it still doesn't have an always-on
display which is ridiculous when you get
a notification if you close it it
doesn't show notifications that you got
in your like history wheel they're just
not there so that's really smart and so
because we did that video earlier this
week where we intentionally put one of
my calendars yeah yeah it's like
actually useless because it's just
completely full of smack Oh from Justin
three regret all life decisions channel
super fun meeting hi Oh Nikki V back
drop expensive stuff reopen Linus's sex
that got truncated it survived the earth
26 events got for tomorrow phone call
with lioness from one week in the past
fire at Colton fire Colton both fire him
and fire Adam and got another fire
Colton buy apples for tomorrow drop
something test fire alarm as loud as
possible
burn all lionesses sandals thanks night
blood so I'm just you should probably
dealing people are probably what yeah so
people are probably wondering why I'm
wearing an Apple watch while I'm working
on my pixel 3x over yeah I mean it's not
doing anything anyway I'm tell the time
so twitch at loves the retro rants
by the way I bet they do I backed our
YouTube chat does as well you know what
they probably also love speaking of
things they love our sponsor
sports are number one honey head over
join honey calm slash Linus you've
probably heard us talk about it before
but honey is the free shopping tool that
helps you find the best promo codes
whenever you shop online at specific
sites those of you who downloaded honey
from our link have already saved over a
hundred thousand dollars in the past few
months just pretty nuts if you don't
know what honey is it's a free browser
extension available on Chrome Firefox
and Safari that saves you time and money
when you're shopping online in over
thirty thousand stores honey works on
Amazon eBay new egg raiser Best Buy
Walmart and more they get a small
commission from the sites so that is
where honey saves you money it's always
free for you or that's where they make
their money excuse me honey gets a small
commission from the site where honey
saves you money so it's always free for
you it installs in just two clicks and
Colton and Brandon a few others here
have used behind you to save money
shopping online oh you too oh yeah
oh man those waiteth I actually shop
online far less than you would probably
think most of my impulse purchases are
tech and most of those will they get
purchased through work so I don't
actually do it
that makes sense yeah so you can get
honey for free right now at join honey
calm / Linus we're gonna have that
linked well we have that link right
there you know it was good for me with
honey yes was I had it when buying gifts
last Christmas oh so I just every time I
buy a gift for Christmas just give honey
a shot it's gonna it's gonna like one
thing about it is it's gonna be like
I've got like 15 coats I don't know if
one of these is gonna work but I'll try
them and you just tell it to go for it
and if it fails it's like well there you
go
and if it works it's like hey I saved
you this much money it takes like a
couple seconds it's great you know what
else takes a couple seconds signing up
for private Internet access P ia hides
your true IP address and allows you to

waiting for
check them out at private internet.com /
pages / - - tech - tips we need a better
vanity URL from yes yeah
and finally we could probably get - tech
tips comm slash VPN working oh yeah
that'd be kind of cool yeah
that would be nice direct people like
they're fine and stuff well I think no I
think they want the vanity URL on their
side so they can track it otherwise they
just have to take our word for it and
we're honest but like I mean it would
just link over oh yeah that could work
oh yeah we should just do that yeah we
should get like our own shortener yeah
I know Jake knows how to set it up I
think it's like 10 minutes or something
like that if you know what you're doing
yeah anyway fresh books yeah fresh books
is the super simple to use invoicing
tool that actually does a lot more than
help you create and send slick-looking
invoices it helps you track your time
manage your expenses and keep track of
who owes you what including a feature
that shows you when your clients look at
your invoice for the first time their
mobile app has all the functionality of
their desktop version so you can take
fresh books with you wherever you go and
if you have any trouble you can reach
out to their support staff where you
will speak to a real human no phone tree
no escalations no return calls just
answers it is eerie when you call a
company like fresh books or ting and you
call them and someone's like hi what can
I help you with there supposed to be a
tree yeah why am I not talking to a
computer go visit fresh books calm slash
man if you're any kind of freelancer or
you work for yourself it is worth giving
it a try 30 days is free just enter when
and how did you hear about us section
all right an actual tech topic I
shouldn't do the intro now just to troll
people but what can I do for you Nick
usually when he comes down here during
the show it's terrible news turning on
YouTube memberships yeah you can you can
turn it on right now if you want so
actually it's probably worth actually
it's probably worth talking to you guys
about this because I feel like we're
sending somewhat mixed messages
right now there are no fewer than three
different ways that you can send a
monthly contribution to Linus Media
Group you can subscribe on Twitch you
can subscribe on Flo plain or as of one
minute from now you can use YouTube
memberships to subscribe yeah man that's
confusing terminology you missed one on
YouTube did I miss one hold on hold on
let me think let me think anything okay
is he gonna get it
twitch YouTube oh yes you can contribute
on the forum yeah so I had that bundled
in with Flo plain because technically
most of the forum contributors are
contributing like four or four players
yes but yes we actually do have a
significant number of even like gold
level contributors who are amazing like
actually it works out pretty well
cuz the forum is one of those weird side
projects that never really panned out in
terms of being a money-making endeavor
yeah but because of the contributors on
the forum our costs for running the
servers for the forum and even like a
little bit of man time to make sure that
it doesn't completely fall apart it's
mostly mortis it's covered thank you
Morris
so yeah it's we have an amazing team
over there and not just an amazing team
there's a reason I call it out in almost
every video that we do it's a great
community over there so it but it's like
it's self-sufficient now which is which
is because of the contributors there so
in terms of like actual linus media
group like the videos stuff I still
consider there to be three yeah um
Brandon sent me a message that said do
not reply no he didn't that was actually
Nick but hangouts notifications are what
Oh am I not allowed to say that is that
not so here's how this works we have
never really sold subscribing on Twitch
no because we think that's a bad idea
yeah we have a fifty-fifty rev share
with twitch which means that twitch is
basically just taking half of your five
dollars every month so that you can
watch
literally one live stream a week for
like roughly an hour for ya ruffnut even
always at full power so we've never
really pitched that as a good idea yeah
and then best-looking so it's someone
who's subscribed to twitch right now
just oh no - say it isn't true says RC
mal I think that's the same guy who said
oh no yeah okay oh then there's a trap
giving out gift subs he's done 61 in
this channel alone traps kind of a beast
so so anyway you know thanks to you guys
but like it's really never been like you
know something that keeps the lights on
it like this media group yeah AB
scription yeah
so then vessel came along and do not
reply from Brandon because I haven't
cleared that notification was just so
mad so mad getting so triggered right
now I just need to like mute this thing
and like put it away stop looking at so
that in vessel came along and then died
and and then we and then we created flow
plane such as you guys know Luke is CEO
oh and basically does all the things
over there he runs that runs that ship
or plane or whatever it is vessel nope
excuse me it's a plane um so he runs
that and the way that flow plane works
is that flow plane takes a cut but one
that is actually smaller than what
twitch takes believe it or not and then
Linus me tiger takes a cut after the
payments cut is subtracted yeah does
that all make sense to everyone
yeah okay they're just still better than
the way that YouTube works is YouTube
takes a cut and - meteor group takes a
cut so this is going to be the story
we're gonna have the feature enabled
because the reality of it is there are
going to be people out there lots of
them that want to support Linus tech
tips or tech quickie or channel super
fun or whatever content stream it is
that they enjoy and have no interest in
going off platform in registering a
separate credit card now that they've
already set it up for super chatting
over on bit way detective
there's something on YouTube they did
they just they wanted stay in the Google
ecosystem because they can't be arsed to
go sign up for some other third-party
service there are always going to be
those people so for those people we are
enabling that for the people who are
willing to go off-site we are still
going to be supporting floatplane 100%
and floatplane is still going to be the
platform that gets early access video
yeah and we have worked out a deal with
YouTube where it's cool if we have early
access video on our own owned and
operated site that we're gonna maintain
and we don't have that for YouTube
subscribers and if people like like
wanna subscribe on YouTube then cool
that's great if they want to support us
that's great we appreciate that but
early access is floatplane and
floatplane is have actually has reached
some really cool milestones internally
lately and you can expect to see more
options than just three dollars for one
week early access at 1080p yeah then the
the technically the newest hire guy is
building some cool tools for that and
there's a lot of other things that are
coming through the pipeline right now
that are that are gonna be fun and new
while we're at this do you want to just
pimp the other position you're trying to
hire again yeah let's do it
there's a forum that is going to be can
I give me a second I'm gonna post it in
twitch chat right now while you're doing
that actually I might as well show
what's what's really access on
floatplane right yeah so we have a tech
quickie on cable management Oh actually
I have a master account so I can see
everyone so tech deals has asked tech
deals number 14 Q&amp;amp;A best support nvme is
it worth it we've got oh lordy six
editors one CPU hurt two out of question
worse it's been a it's been a rough time
bit wit has hotline 2.0 pre water
cooling build final core specs revealed
tech deals another QA Linus tech tips
the hundred dollar vertical mouse this
things won't go man we've got this oh
this is we we put tech linked up there
but it's like it's not early access
it's a news show here let's just okay
there's a lot of good stuff a lot of
tech deal stuff so six orders one CPU
yep part 1 of 2 and then part 2 of
question mark that gives you guys some
idea of how that whole thing went Tec
wiki why is Wi-Fi slower than Ethernet
we've got we bought a cheap SSD on
Aliexpress that's actually even more
interesting than you might think
cool we've got this keyboard that raised
$300,000 on IndieGoGo and is frankly
effing terrible to put it to put it
bluntly yeah I'm not surprised
ya know the Asya retro classic is really
nice ok ya know this thing though I'm
key whatever this is raise $300,000 on
IndieGoGo oh it's terrible what else do
we have in here we've actually done a
fair number of simultaneous releases
lately but we definitely have is that it
this was fun I think it's on both now
but this one just came out anyway so
we've got early access stuff over there
that's going to continue to be happening
ok should we do a news topic I feel like
I've talked about the pixel 3 a lot so
oh ok all right here we go so this was
posted on the forum by oh never mind
there's just a business insider source
it doesn't matter the point is I'm gonna
quickly go it's basically hiring an
infrastructure guy there's more details
in the Google forms link in the twitch
chat all posted on chemicals that's fine
I can't you just like it's over so it's
a web address oh sure I'm not ok anyways
it'll be in the description later so
check it out they're hiring someone to
help with the infrastructure side of
things and there's a huge massive
questionnaire that's like do you have
experience with this if so how much and
then that repeated like a whole bunch of
times
and basically we're just trying to get a
picture of like how familiar you are
with some of the stuff that we've used
I've had some people be like you should
allow like short answered stuff I mean
if you have 0 years of experience with
everything that we're using if you're if
you're able to
move local great if you're not if you
have tons of experience with me but like
it's we have good responses already so
so not trying to discourage you just
saying okay pixel three after this form
I do an email out then you send me
resume stuff we do it that way sounds
good what is happening all right
are you tired okay of every year oh boy
whether it's Google or Apple or Samsung
yeah are you tired of every year then
putting some shiny new feature in your
face that just sounds so amazing it's
almost unbelievable when they still
haven't figured out basic stuff what are
we talking about in video no we're
talking about the pixel three right now
okay so they've got this call screen
feature that lets a robot answer the
phone for you and transcribes the
dialogue on your lock screen that sounds
pretty cool do you remember that thing
they talked about last year where you're
like Google assistant could make
appointments for you it could like call
the hair salon and make an employment
was that last year I was last year that
was pixel two if I recall correctly whoa
okay remember that AI camera that's
stupid thing what was that thing called
I don't remember that that stupid AI
camera that was gonna just like
automatically take great pictures or
whatever okay Apple wireless charging
last night when I got home I realized
that I had left the key to the super
Lambo in the ignition okay okay so I
walk in my door at home I'm like I pull
out my shiny new pixel three XL and I
say hey Google it goes oh your
Internet's not working I go are you
effing kidding me my internet is working
I browse to a webpage yeah it's working
just fine hey Google your Internet's not
working like I'll turn off my Wi-Fi ok
cellular data good we got it my internet
working because whatever hey Google
remind me tomorrow when I get to work to
take the key out of the Civic okay I've
set your reminder it's an 8 a.m.
reminder that has so that has nothing to
do with the time that I'm normally like
barely even awake at 8 a.m. let alone at
work it gives me no prompt to change it
alter it in any way
and then I go oh crap uh okay Google
show me my reminders and that's the
first time it managed to pick that up
that's great
so I go okay google show me my reminders
it not only doesn't show me my my
reminders page yeah it reads me only my
next reminder which is a reminder to go
check on my daughter and take her
fingers out of her mouth if she's
sucking on them because it's making your
teeth wonky okay and I'm sitting here
going this assistant he's expected to
make appointments for me it can barely
do basic stuff like fundamental stuff so
here's here's my here's my unsolicited
advice for the Google assistant team get
your shit together don't make new things
improve you have stopped making new
things yeah altogether for like a year
okay what I'll give them to go back and
and look at like some of the very
frequently requested stuff that you
haven't been able to help with or that
people because I know you collect data
about when someone sets a reminder and
then they go in and they change it
manually after like when you got it
wrong go look at that stuff because that
is way more important okay that's all I
have to say about the Google Hardware
minute oh let's move on to this was
supposed to buy carcass on the forum and
it's the Intel ninth gen benchmarking
scandal ooh so why don't we go through
why don't we go through the series of
events yeah we're almost done give me
five minutes five minutes because this
is like the headline topic it was in the
thumbnail I have to talk about it when
we don't people get mad especially
because we can't change the thumbnails
now all right so as Intel's new ninth
gen chips became available for pre-order
there were no benchmarks available
because tech journalists were under
embargo now this is a behavior that we
feel strongly is inappropriate
don't think you should take pre-orders
for products that haven't been evaluated
by independent third parties but the
reality of it is we are just we are just
a drop in the ocean of voices of
consumers that are apparently dumb
enough to just go buy stuff without
having seen it evaluated by a
third-party independent whatever right
so there's nothing we can do about
pre-order culture
apparently I wish we could but we can't
yeah um one publication PC games end
though published benchmarks conducted by
a company called principled
technologies their results were claiming
that the ninety nine hundred K was up to
fifty percent faster than the rise in
seven twenty seven hundred X in gaming
so Steve Walton of tech spot immediately
thought the data looked suspicious and
eventually uncovered a series of steps
taken to handicap AMD okay that's good
that's a little bit color commentary
there a series of things that occurred
or things that weren't done that should
have been done to benefit yeah that made
the AMD chip not put put forward its
best showing and allowed the Intel CPU
to shine they used Corsair Vengeance
memory without loading the XMP profile
setting the frequency to twenty nine
thirty three and leaving the loose
default memory timings in place the AMD
system used to stop cooler while until
used in Nhu 14s that doesn't make a
difference but sure whatever a game mode
was enabled on the AMD system disabling
fifty percent of its course something
that anyone who knows much about
benchmarking should have known like so
game mode is more for thread Ripper and
less for like four and eight core Rison
process the argument with the coolers
because the case was really bad
apparently sure just adding some context
there I have no information on whether
or not a throttle so a big part of the
scandal is that apparently Intel
contracted principal technologies - to
like evaluate the these Prince processor
and there's there's a hundred reasons
why companies might do something like
that it can be useful to sidestep
internal politics to get like an
independent third parties opinion on
the performance and the market
positioning of your product that can
help well pricing everyone discounts
internal benchmarks
it can affect pricing at canosa it can
affect forecasting there you might want
to show benchmarks to you know analysts
or to partners ahead of launch while the
like just the independent press is still
under embargo and if you just show your
own numbers that you ran it lacks
credibility so there's a lot of reasons
why companies will contract someone
third party in order to get their
products evaluated so there seems to be
a couple of issues here one of them is
that principled technologies you know
actually there was a beer as a big to-do
about Ryan shroud from PC perspective
creating like a secondary side business
that's all about this kind of
consultation for companies it's not this
one just to be super good yeah it's not
principled technologies so I think a
shrout research so so there's a couple
of problems here because one people are
mad because the results were not
necessarily reflective of the real-world
differences in performance between Intel
and their own processors and Intel's new
processor and AMD's processors but I
think that people are getting on making
a bit of a mountain out of a mole here
here because we don't well here molehill
here because we don't know what the
event was we don't actually know if
principal technologies is completely
incompetent and we don't know if Intel
did this out of malice because obviously
the pre-orders on a CPU remember this is
a supply chain that has taken decades to
develop like the pre-orders on a CPU are
not significant this isn't like a game
where you are making you know and I'm
using arbitrary numbers here but where
you are making fifty percent of your
total sales for this title within the
first couple of weeks it's not like that
well you have you have experience at a
retailer yes so you will typically see a
spike you'll typically see a couple
weeks where your where your weekly run
rate is thirty to fifty to you maybe
even double if you have a great launch
and then it settles in and you move the
bulk of your product over the life cycle
of the product
so it's not like this was like a sneaky
trick to you know sell a bunch of CPUs
before people realize they're garbage
most people don't suddenly upgrade when
something new comes out most people
upgrade when they want a new computer
another thing too is that all of the
industry scuttlebutt that I've seen that
has any kind of credibility to it is
that Intel is going to be supply
constrained on these chips anyway so if
their intent was to like drum up a bunch
of sales and make everything else look
bad then they're really shooting
themselves in the foot with this ninety
nine hundred K launch because if they
can't ship enough of the bloody things
then what good are they doing themselves
if they have everybody waiting around
for ninety nine hundred case so that's
another factor that makes me sort of
wonder if if we should attribute to
malice what we could have attributed to
incompetence and as much as Intel might
have just been done here and hired the
wrong consultancy firm might I recommend
trout research or himself these days
next time that might be better um they
have oh that would have its own
controversy but anyway they had to know
that this was going to come back and
reflect on them poorly if they chose the
wrong third-party house to do this
testing and so some of the backlash is
definitely deserved because there also
should have been oversight from Intel
where they should have gone we'll hold
on a second that's not really right now
with all of that said I don't understand
why there was such a big blowup about
this because what all of you and all of
the rest of the tech press should have
done is they should have completely
ignored these numbers we should have
looked at these numbers as exactly the
same kinds of numbers that AMD showed
off at their Hawaii launch event for the
tooth ninety series we should have
ignored them the way that we ignored
AMD's numbers when they originally
launched Rison and I remember asking
someone actually add a name the event
why did you put twice as much memory in
the Intel system here as in your own
system and they were like oh well we
thought it was the fairest way Reisen
had all kinds of issues with the memory
controller they couldn't run it any
other way it's not any different from
those graphs that Nvidia shows at their
long
yeah where they just have like like 18
games and then they show like a bar and
they're like yeah it's like that much
better when some of them might have been
equal and some of them might have been
weird anomalies where they perform like
twice as fast it's not any different
from anything that intel has ever shown
why why are we treating anything other
than post-launch benchmarks from
independent parties as anything other
than marketing fluff this I just don't
see the difference and maybe I'm missing
something here so when a twitch chat is
is pretty sure you are but hasn't
pointed out a single necessarily reason
why
yeah I agree on a lot of your points I
think there are a few more issues with
to testing probably and and a little bit
of the mentality behind it after
watching the interview and watching some
other things and I agree with some
points and don't disagree and disagree
with other points that were brought up
in the interview and pavo yeah but yeah
I don't we do this every single this
seems like a just a little bit more than
we do every single other time but we
always do the same thing every single
time right where every single review
were like wow those numbers are
ridiculous why doesn't everyone wait
until independent reviewers get their
own numbers out then cross reference
across all reviewers yeah because you
shouldn't also just look at one
reviewers because anyone can make a
mistake even route research can make a
mistake we've made plenty of mistakes
like everyone makes mistakes that's why
I mean when back before I got an
opportunity to test the hardware
personally or you know have someone on
my staff who I'm directly you know
sitting next to testing the hardware you
know I would always read at least three
to four reviews of anything that was
back when you read reviews and yeah I
watch yeah dating myself a little bit I
guess and then if there was an anomaly
you could go okay why then you start to
dig in if everyone agrees it's usually
fine unless something very scandalous
happens later like that whole thing with
the GTX 970 and the half a gig of ram
that was
lower than the rest or whatever the case
may be so so far I've got over the
person that the testing methodology was
flawed yeah yeah that's exactly what
we're talking about like there was
certain issues like they didn't list the
settings of the use for GTA 5 and as
yeah you and I know that's a real chore
that would be that would be two pages of
the document yeah cuz you can't just set
GT what is it is a real chore but it was
also revealed in the interview
especially that they might not be super
educated on different ways that
reviewers at least these days like
modern reviewers are doing these
different testing methodologies because
there are a lot of weird things and I
did say poor choice of there was a third
party yes that was already covered and I
did say there's some blame lies with
Intel no matter what the argument Linus
is making and by extension me because I
agree with this is that it just doesn't
matter and everyone should ignore it not
that there wasn't problems with it I
think I think some people in twitchchat
are are just pitch forking because they
want to be mad about this whole
situation yeah which is great
you should completely ignore those
numbers because they're dumb and you
should ignore them and usually
manufacturers mislead you yes we're just
saying that this isn't new no it's not
unique to Intel and yes it's trendy to
hate on Intel and we get it but there
this particular instance doesn't look
especially different to me than what
we've seen from until in the past
ambi Nvidia you pretty much name it I
mean do you remember do you remember the
sales pitch Microsoft gave for game mode
we were actually talking about it in our
in our writers meeting this Monday we
should revisit game mode because back
when we did our video and it basically
did nothing a lot of the community
feedback was like well they're gonna fix
it over time and they're like let's find
out if they fix that over time because
I'm very much guarantee they didn't ya
know that would actually be awesome yeah
I would love that video personally so so
we should always take manufacturer
claims with a grain of salt that's the
lesson and we didn't learn it because
people are still pre-ordering these
things anyway and there's just nothing
we can do about it so that's it end of
LAN show one more quick quick quick
thing fine we talked about the giant
like 50 million or whatever
I don't remember the number account
Facebook breach not that long ago on
wine show if you want to check how it
impact did you log into Facebook then go
to facebook.com slash help slash
security notice scroll down to the
bottom thank you will from the
floatplane team for sharing this with me
scroll down to the bottom and then there
should be a box which will give you some
details about how secure your account is
pay attention to the wording it will not
say you were breached you were not
breached it will sound a little bit more
or a little bit less sure depending on
how how problematic your account is so
yeah check that out that's why I'm
officially licensed Wireless GameCube
controllers are coming to switch that's
pretty sick I just want to throw that
out there and also Google Plus hack and
end-of-life lol Google Plus the gift
that keeps on giving
it's like NCIX ok bye everyone bye oh
yeah we can mention the discord logo
contest we're doing a Halloween themed
LTT logo design contest on discord on
Newsies lat
music for the intros plain right now so
I gotta go I gotta go
