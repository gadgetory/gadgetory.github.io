reach as many people as possible who
want to attend our meetup and garage
sale on the twenty first of August 2015
and we thought to ourselves right we'll
make a video so I want to start then by
setting realistic expectations the
garage sale is not gonna have enough
stuff for everyone who comes to build a
decked-out PC on the cheap at all while
some categories will have lots of stuff
like cases others like hard drives we
can't garage sale for security reasons
and still others we wouldn't even be
allowed to give away due to the
agreements we have with the companies
who sent them to us so treat this more
like a meet-up and if you find something
you like it should be considered a bonus
will likely have some kind of limit in
place initially at least like one or two
items per person except for bulky stuff
like cases that we really want to get
rid of and pricing is likely to drop
throughout the day as items sit there
with nobody being interested in them the
other thing that we said we do is tours
of the new office for people who want to
see our workspace in person but given
that we have no idea how many people are
planning to show up it's unclear at this
time how these will work so it might end
up being super casual or if we have like
500 people in our parking lot we might
have to split people up into small
groups for guided tours so the big
takeaway is this mallanna's Media Group
crew should all be there if you want to
come hang out but if you're expecting a
big organized production then you've
probably never moved before in your life
and you definitely haven't been watching
our moving blog so yeah if you're down
to keep it casual then it's on the
twenty first of August 2015 from around
noon to around eight give or take and
there might be some you know chips and
and pop or whatever else but we're gonna
keep it super mellow and we hope to see
you guys there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
