tell me something am I the only one who
gets confused by AMD's naming scheme
many times I've had to reshoot part of a
video because I was like today we're
gonna be having a look at those 7970
versus the 77 90 or the 77 70 or the 79
9 I mean they're all that there's only
two numbers that change they should just
call them like the you know rejuvenator
and like the like the the the Bushmaster
or like things like that they should
have names like pocket knives anyway
this is the 77 90 which is slightly
better than the 77 70 but not nearly as
good as the 7970 this is one from msi it
is an overclocked graphics card which
basically means that it comes with a
higher default clock speed than a stock
one from directly from AMD would if you
could buy something like that and the
year wasn't sort of 2006 it has one gig
of gddr5 although this GPU is available
with more memory and i might recommend
stepping up to the 2gig one if it
doesn't cost that much more its PCI
Express 2.0 DirectX 11 its supports AMD
eyefinity all those good things and here
we are so we got a piece of foam here
that keeps it in place we've got a
graphics card here that puts your games
in their place and we've got a couple of
little adapters I remember when graphics
cards used to have a lot of different
stuff in the packages and honestly I
don't really miss those days because
nowadays they come with exactly what you
need and not a whole lot more now this
card is not based on exactly the same
court as the 7770 in the 77 50 and it's
also not based on the same core as the
78 50 and the 7870 in fact the rumor on
the street is that this would have been
an 8000 series card if things had gone
slightly differently for it and it would
have been more like a replacement for a
77 70 as a next generation architecture
and it kind of aligns with that rumor in
terms of the performance although I can
neither confirm nor deny whether that
was ever true or not because quite
I actually don't know so there you go I
don't even know why I bought they're
talking about that MSI includes little
dust covers on all of the connectors so
you don't have to worry about any kind
of corrosion or like you know bio
hazardous bleaches eating the connectors
while it's in transit or whatever else
could possibly happen to a DVI connector
while sitting in a box it also gives you
if you're ever storing the card like if
you want to keep it on like a trophy
shelf like if you want to tournament
with this card and you wanted to like
put it somewhere and keep it on display
then you could cover up the connectors
so that they don't get covered in you
know what why don't I just stay focused
from now on so we've got a 100
millimeter cooling fan that uses MSI's
propeller blades so you can tell from
the the tip on there so these are
designed to push a little bit more
airflow than standard blades remember
cooling graphics cards is a bit of a
challenge because of the form factors
that are necessary this is a 2 slot card
and so you often end up using thin fans
that aren't really able to do much in
terms of static pressure you also often
end up with very dense fin arrangements
so it's incredibly important to design a
fan that is able to deliver ample
pressure in order to push air through
these fans and actually cool the GPU as
well as the other components of the card
itself the shroud is plastic but it has
kind of a nice look to it MSI has really
done a great job with their styling over
the last few years so there's a solid
aluminum block here that is attached to
some aluminum fins up here and then
there are two heat pipes that appear to
be direct touch heat pipe so those are
contacting the GPU core directly and
they then carry heat out to the aluminum
finish meant here as well as here now
you can see into the back of the card
there's some components that look like
they're gonna get some incidental
cooling from the fan itself as well as
your single 6 pin PCI Express connector
then over here we've got another
heatsink that's attached directly to the
PCB that's going to be for your vrm so
they're actually bringing power into the
board at the back and then turning it
into the different voltages that the
board itself can use that the chips on
board can use right over here so that's
sort of fancy routing but it's not the
first time we've seen this particularly
on these shorter length PCI Express
cards so you can see the card itself
isn't much longer than a PCI Express
slot and I think
it's pretty much all there is to say
about that okay yep on the back we find
we're gonna be exhausting some of the
air outside the case but like most
custom cooled cards this one exhausts
most of the air inside the case so make
sure you have adequate ventilation to
DVI ports an HDMI and DisplayPort ports
ensure that this card is able to support
and izaya finiti so that means a
multiple displays and they really do
have the best driver support for this
guys if you want a game across multiple
displays it's probably a good idea to
grab an AMD card however don't buy this
one if you're gonna buy this one buy the
2gig version because even older games
once you start playing at extremely high
resolutions stand a pretty good chance
of utilizing all of that video memory
that they have available to them one
gigs really not going to be enough for
you there it does support crossfire so
there's a single crossfire connector on
the top of the card meaning that's going
to be compatible with two-way
configurations and this is something
that I haven't really seen on an MSI
card before but it looks like they don't
want you removing that stock CPU cooler
so your warranty will be void on this
card if you remove that and take off the
cooler however it should be noted that
these low end cards particularly the
aftermarket PCB ones are usually not
compatible with liquid coolers anyway
particularly full cover ones and if
you're gonna spend the money on a liquid
cooler a full cover blocks 100 bucks
plus so I wouldn't be doing it on a card
that doesn't cost that much more than
100 270 dollars so there that's my tech
