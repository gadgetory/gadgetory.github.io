subreddit would have to say about
getting set up with a new gaming rig
booth yourself man dude up custom or
failing that at least buy from a
reputable assistant builder online but
pretty much no one would recommend is to
go to the local Best Buy ask for a
gaming PC and buy whatever it is that
they bring you but that's what we did
let's see how that worked out for us
shall we the azeroth d-10 gaming router
features gaming Boost Technology m2m
technology Nazz functionality and there
h2r 2 + 1 DLNA travel router dongle head
over to the link in the video
description to find out what the heck I
was just talking about so let's start
with the shopping experience I actually
sent my wife in my stead in an effort to
see just how frustrating it would be for
a more normal person to find a gaming PC
at the local big-box store so at the
first store the initial salesperson
explained that the difference between
the $900 gaming PC and the $1500 one was
aesthetics and that gaming computers
just cost more the actual difference was
that the gaming one had a video card
fortunately my wife realized that and
found someone else to talk to
the second rep was much better but
didn't have anything in stock to sell
though in her defense the store is
moving like four days so fine onto store
number two or are we in spite of having
one of the reps from the first store
call ahead to reserve a unit of the PC
my wife was trying to buy the second
store sold it while she was enroute and
called her when she'd already been
driving for 10 minutes to come and get
it time to head somewhere else then
third time's a charm right after waiting
around to talk to a stalking girl and
then getting bounced to the Geek Squad
line and then back again she was finally
offered the Asus m32 CD desktop PC for
nine hundred Canadian dollars or about
625 US with the current exchange rate so
let's have a look at how she made out
then shall we
the m32 CD in the recommended gaming
configuration features an Intel Core i5
6400
I like quad-core eight gigs of DDR four
Ram running in single channel actually
preferred in this case to allow for
cheaper upgrades a one terabyte hard
drive a system specific h1 10
motherboard with a single full size PCIe
16x expansion slot a mini PCIe slot with
an AC wireless card to DIMM slots and
USB 3.1 10 gigabit on the back end
finally an r9 372 gig video card notably
one that features an asus direct cu
style cooler and a very robust security
bar to keep it in place during shipping
the case is nothing special with a
rear-mounted 90 millimeter fan a spot
for another one in the front though I
can't tell where that one would get
fresh air from and a perforated side
panel for airflow and the power supply
actually is a huge step up from what I
expected a 500 watt continuous unit from
Delta with a 120 millimeter fan and
extra plugs for everything from
additional drives the motherboard can
support up to four - even a more
powerful graphics card as long as you
account for keeping it cool actually
overall this package is a lot better
than I expected but still I mean I
figured come on this can't be so hard
I'll head over to good ol NCIX comm and
beat the stuffing out of it with
off-the-shelf components and it's gone
no and it turns out that was not as easy
as I thought
even with NCIX is rock-bottom $50 pc
assembly fee and even ignoring the
obvious subsidies that Microsoft gives
to PC makers for including their
operating system assuming that I wanted
you know a somewhat equivalent AC
wireless solution a DVD writer etc I
still ended up getting pretty much the
same thing for my money without windows
so when you factor Windows into it it
was a full 125 dollars more expensive to
have it built there I mean sure I get
some more PCI Express slots but then I'm
actually giving up a proper pcie-based
Wi-Fi solution for a USB one end
settling for a lesser power supply the
one bundled with the CM elite 350 okay
then time for a new tactic because we're
PCMR right we can build the computer
ourselves saving
a few dollars right there and we don't
necessarily need the cheap mouse that
came with this thing
so I gave myself some more flexibility
on the second config opting for an AMD
FX 6300 processor eight gigs of ddr3 and
MSI 970 a motherboard no included Mouse
DVD driver Wi-Fi then I spent what I
gained on a better graphics card and r9
380 which the college-educated among you
may have already realized isn't an
outright better computer just a
different one one that might be better
for gaming in some games but certainly
isn't better for all tasks or even all
games which I guess leads us to the
conclusion one that I did not see coming
I mean honestly I was sure that after
publishing this video we'd never be
working with best buy on a top 5 laptops
for students thing like we did back in
the fall again I was certain they were
going to get wrecked as the kids say
but that's not how it went down today at
all many of the traditional problems
that have existed since the last time I
bought a desktop computer at Future Shop
like 15 years ago the inability to find
someone to help you the high pressure
sales pitch for extended warranty once
you finally do find someone to help you
the limited stock in selection the hit
or miss knowledge of the in store staff
are all alive and well but the computer
we ended up with is actually a really
great value gaming box our equivalent
build offered better PCIe expansion but
its power supply was not as good and it
didn't have USB 3 10 gigabit not to
mention the huge price disparity and our
DIY build where I built it myself and
gave up some features still only saved
me 15 bucks sure it can deliver better
gaming performance in GPU bound
scenarios but without crippling CPU
performance even further by stepping
down to an APU or something like that
the difference was not nearly what I had
expected so there you have it color me
surprised whether we have Best Buy to
thank for acknowledging the demand for
decent gaming PC's that contain decent
graphics cards or asus and the other
system builders to thank for dumping
these box
on Best Buy's shelf buying a gaming rig
at Best Buy is not as bad an option as
you might think and a savvy used
Hardware shopper could probably manage
to flip that included graphics card plop
in something better and end up with an
astonishingly good rig for around $1000
though while you're at it also recommend
throwing in an SSD speaking of throwing
something in if you're thinking to
yourself gee I could sure use a USB
gaming headset with a nice high quality
mic good sound and RGB lighting maybe
check out the Logitech G 633 Artemus
spectrum it features 7.1 Dolby surround
sound 40 millimeter Pro G audio drivers
end it's compatible with the PC as well
as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one as I
mentioned before it features adjustable
RGB lighting and custom tags with a
cardioid boom mic and it's available now
on Amazon all you got to do is pick them
up at the link in the video description

where I build well technically there
were two CPUs but I basically build one
rig that runs fed in gaming instances at
once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
