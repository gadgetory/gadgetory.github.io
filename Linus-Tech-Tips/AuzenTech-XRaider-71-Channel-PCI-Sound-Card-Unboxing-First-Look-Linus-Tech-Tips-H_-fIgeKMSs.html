the X Raider 7.1 from awesome tech this
is one of their lower end cards but it
does still have some key features first
of all you've got support for 7.1 audio
so that means you can hook it up to
basically any audio system that you can
get your hands on for a pc I don't know
that there are too many people running
you know 9.1 or 7.2 audio systems on
their computers but I mean hey if you're
doing that then feel free to drop us a
comment on the video and you know let me
know hey Linus you're off your rocker
you have no idea what you're talking
about i'm running that so this is a pci
sound card as i mentioned before you got
support for 7.1 audio but there's also
some other cool stuff first of all
you've got support for optical input and
output which is something that it has
over its little brother the X studio 5.1
and you've also got swappable op amp
sockets for all all 8 channels so that's
a pretty cool feature as well have a
closer look at the card in just a minute
I just want to have a look at the
accessory package so they've got an easy
set-up guide shows you how to install
your drivers and yeah hey look at that
they've even got instructions for
downloading the drivers off the Oz and
tech website good work auzentech that is
the correct thing to do what else do we
have in here we have a driver CD ok so
you probably won't need that because you
can download the drivers off the
manufacturer website so that's it that's
the whole accessory package other than
that we've just got a part now awesome
tech cards as I mentioned in my last
unboxing in the house intact hard are
generally speaking the best purchased
choice to make kien your price range
whatever your price range happens to be
to figure out your price range how much
you want to spend on a sound card and if
you just by nas and tech card for
however much that is then you'll
probably get pretty much the best card
for your dollar so here we aren't we've
got internal digital audio out this is
running off of the hope can't see that
huh chip said is that we have a look
well apparently it's using an exterior
audio engine okay whatever that means
and we're actually running a c-media cmi
eight seven six eight audio processor I
think it's just labeled a little bit
differently oh no it's not nevermind I
was just apparently I went crazy for a
minute I couldn't see the I couldn't see
that right there okay nevermind i
figured it up so here's all your
swappable op and socket so you can go
ahead take those out these will base it
I mean amplification is what gives you
most of the distortion in your audio so
if you replace them with a higher
quality op amp or if you replace them
with one that just sounds a little bit
better to you you can actually get a
very customizable sound out of a fairly
inexpensive card with that particular
feature so that's pretty cool you've
also got support for front panel audio
so there's no custom headers or anything
like that you just hook that right up to
your front panel HD audio so here we are
here is our digital optical in and out
and then our 7.1 interface so thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the ex
Raider 7.1 pci sound card oh yeah oh
nevermind hold on apparently it has some
unique karaoke functionality cool you
can add color with Mike echo key
shifting and vocal cancellation that's
pretty neat software feature don't
