our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys we're here with Peter nygren who
is the I don't know whatever title he
wants to give himself sales rep janitor
CEO president owner of me onyx so you
guys have heard me just Yammer on and on
and on and on about this keyboard this
is the Ziebell 60 this is not a new
product i know because i've been using
one for months now i love it this is my
favorite keyboard cherry MX blacks are
not my favorite switches but there's
some kind of voodoo magic in this
keyboard that makes them feel way better
than any other MX black keyboard I have
encountered they've also got some new
products such as the nails 8200 which
will be doing an unboxing of shortly
there's actually one waiting for me at
home it's got 16.2 million colors
available to it right six 16.8 pardon me
and it has an 80 200 DPI sensor the same
ergonomics from the nails 30 205,000
this is just more of an upgraded skew
but what I really want Peter to talk
about is what's in his hand right here
yeah so this is a new headset that we
will release later this year probably in
early quota to this is an analog version
what special way is we r memory foam in
here we also have angled drivers which
is older file we don't apply settings so
we about tell me more about the
advantage of angled drivers what does
that do for the listening experience a
bit basically your ear is not totally
flat this angled so we want to face the
driver to the right position basically
so it's not like a big angle it's a
smaller angle but that makes a big
difference now I've tried I've tried
these on already so I already know the
answer to this but explain what you've
done to make this headset extremely
comfortable
yeah basically its memory foam in here
you can actually see how softest
material is and it basically forms off
your head in your ears and everything so
that's one of the things and also that
it's you can move the yolk up inner ear
cap in any direction or ear pads
basically exactly okay so guys basically
the only real thing that that Peter
missed that I think is really important
about this thing is the fact that it has
volume control that you can actually
freaking operate without looking at it
so instead of having sort of like you
know a button or some kind of thing on
here too you just have the traditional
wheel you go like that you change the
volume you don't have to sort of think
of okay you know it doesn't have its
it's an actual analog wheel instead of
just being sort of like some free
spinning things so you can off on with
one-touch not even thinking about it
also the mic will mute itself as soon as
you put it up so you guys are going to
have two versions of this right yeah
actually we're going to have quite many
versions this is the base model it would
come in some different colors this
version but then you will also get like
USB versions and other things to come up
later this year but of course you can't
tell us all the secrets or we wouldn't
have anything to make videos about for
the rest of this year is that right well
we have like many things so i could
probably continue for another hour but
yeah something like that thank you for
your restraint Peter and guys don't miss
