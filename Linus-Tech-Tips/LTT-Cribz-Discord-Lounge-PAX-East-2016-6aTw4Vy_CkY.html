see where I like to hang out my boys at
discord they're fighting stuff like DDoS
they're protecting IPs all day so what

one other way to practice protecting
people then literally in the ring hey

latency that's one big deal with this
cord we can't have a lot of CPU usage
you got to say to have something that's
fast naturally not like that's crap you
go with this you're good so this is
discord easy to set up simple fast no
problem this is a competition it's a
mess you know I mean the boys are disco
and after we hit the gym we like to work
on our Rubik's cubes because then we get
to work on our knowledge which is
awesome because we need to work on
problem solving all damn day so we got
this custom-built custom-painted Rubik's
Cube installed it's sick gets me really
charged up
when you're hanging with your boys's
discord lounge it's all about connecting
the dots and that means connecting you
to your friends or you know not that's
okay too

this place is this custom water cooled
water cooler and the greatest thing
about this is just like discord it's
