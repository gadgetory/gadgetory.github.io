playground than an unboxing of the
latest gaming desktop from Acer the
predator actually that's a totally
inappropriate joke but whatever you guys
so this is the predator G Series which
is not quite like the original predator
where it aimed to be sort of a super
extreme extreme enthusiast machine with
all the sort of crazy crazy stuff going
on this is more like if someone sort of
walked up to me and said hey for a
reasonable price what components would
you put in a gaming rig and this is a
list that I could very conceivably come
up with so in terms of specs we've got a
core i7 3770 no that's not a Kei
processor it's an unlocked processor
it's not for overclocking this is not an
overclocking machine for the graphics
card we've got an 87 60 so it is a 2 gig
card however it should be noted that
when it comes to those more mid-range
cards the the actual vram the the memory
buffer is less of a factor and it's more
about the GPU itself now I've never had
the pleasure of testing in 8760 so I'm
excited to kind of check that out it's
got 32 gigs of ddr3 memory which makes
it a rock star of a sort of video
editing or workstation platform which is
really cool and then it's also got a
blu-ray drive making it a media
powerhouse and a 2 terabyte hard drive
with a 16 gig solid-state cache
it is so rare that we see Intel's Smart
Response technology implemented on a
desktop and yet I don't understand why
it makes a lot of sense it does make a
difference it does make the computer
perform better and it's not that
expensive so there you go you got some
little sort of how to use Windows 8 sort
of documentation included I'm gonna ask
B roll my camera operator today to come
over here and check this out while we
open up the box here so we've got an
included keyboard which quite frankly
doesn't really feel like anything
special up a little bit here let's go
ahead and there's a couple pieces of
tape holding on but I mean what do you
really expect from a tier one system
keyboard okay people like chiclet
keyboards
so you have it just dust your standard
USB keyboard bit of a funny layout
actually so there's a number pad and
then what they've done is they've
rearranged these to make it a little bit
of a shorter keyboard they've rearranged
the delete insert home and end page up
and page down and they've compressed
everything together a little bit it is a
bilingual layout and personally I prefer
monolingual layouts but it's a Canadian
version so that explains it so there's a
short shift on the left is short enter
on the right and would prefer to see a
long shift in a long enter but for our
American viewers or quite frankly anyone
in almost any other territory you
probably won't get one that looks like
that so I wouldn't worry about it too
much
and inside Oh hold on first we've got
more accessories I have no idea how
we're gonna put this back together we're
in the middle of a playground we
actually are and I have created some
work for myself here so documentation
wise we've got adding a heart just oh
cool they include a little like little
tutorials for how to upgrade your system
and do maintenance on it that's nice
optical mouse okay your standard optical
mouse that you'd expect to be included
with a Tier one system DVI to VGA
adapter just in case you're still using
a VGA monitor a couple of wireless
antennas Bob first presumably for a dual
band power cable also included and last
but not least the system itself now the
original predator had kind of an out
there and look to it it was pretty it
was pretty different from everything
else and this one takes some cues from
the old predator but keeps things a
little bit more well a little bit less
polarizing in terms of the look size why
is the predator g-series is about what
you'd expect from an m-80 X tower so you
can tell from the back what the actual
form factor is so there's a standard m
ATX motherboard for expansion slots I'm
gonna open it up so we can check it out
you've got a standard ATX power supply
92 millimeter cooling fan there's your
video card it's nice to see a proper
like dual slot like proper video card in
a you know an OEM sort of tier one type
machine that you'd actually buy at a
big-box store because for the honey not
everyone is comfortable building their
own computer for all of those of you
watching my videos yes I know this is a
pre-built machine yes
don't have to like it but at the end of
the day most people buy a prebuilt
computer okay let that sink in for a
moment so it's nice that they at least
have an option that has a real video
card in it because how many times have
you had people go upgrade the graphics
card oh yeah you can't so yeah anyway so
3770 as we mentioned before 32 gigs ram
you know what we've covered all this
bluetooth is included so that's probably
what that secondary antenna is for I
mentioned before that it took some
styling cues from the older predator so
you can see that's where this orange
trim comes in as well as the sort of
nice stamped logo on the side other than
that it kind of looks like a classier
version of what you'd expect to see for
a tier one box at a big-box store so
it's got a card reader which is a nice
inclusion I wish more I wish more
aftermarket cases included this kind of
stuff does XD micro sd well look at that
has a dedicated micro SD slot
regular SD memory stick Pro and then
compact flash as well as front USB three
front USB 2 and front headphone and
microphone ports power buttons got a
nice chrome sort of finish on it here
and then you've got kind of like a
performance stripy looking thing going
on on the top as well as a handle here
so you can carry the thing around as a
land box it actually wouldn't be that
bad much like any other sort of micro
ATX system so I want to get you guys
like sort of a nice look at the G on the
front as well as the orange trim here
your drives are accessed through these
guys right here so it looks like oh cool
look at hard drive cage oh I guess if
I'd looked at the instructions that they
included for how to upgrade the hard
drive I would have already known about
this but that's awesome even just as
like sort of swappable storage it's got
a toolless installation so you can just
go ahead and pop that bad boy in there
and then shut it down and then this top
one has the blu-ray drive so the eject
buttons are actually over here on the
other side we find ventilation which
also has another sort of G style logo as
well as another predator stamp on the
side and then on the bottom we find what
looks like sort of your standard chassis
so let's go ahead and open it up and see
what we see
I guess there's one more thing we can
cover here on the back dedicated ps2
keyboard and mouse ports the onboard
video is to say
because it does have a dedicated
graphics card four USB 2.0 ports two USB
3.0 ports 5.1 audio and Gigabit Ethernet
if there was something I was gonna
complain about back here it would be I
wish they had dedicated 5.1 slots I've
had people tell me that this isn't 5.1
audio actually it is the ports are
configurable so you can change what they
output to but I'd like to see the full
Bank of six so we're gonna go back to
the lab or we're gonna go get a
screwdriver and then we'll open it up I
guess this is the problem with sending
your system to this is actually I just
realized as we were leaving the park
where we unbox the prisoner I just
realized that this was the first time
that I've ever unboxed and done a
showcase of like a Tier one system
before like if you build system so
anyway I guess this is the problem with
sending it to someone like me because
I'm gonna open it up and have a look at
what they have done inside so check this
out 80 plus bronze power supply which is
nice to see you don't have to implement
an 80 plus bronze power supply in the
system like this but they have it is a
500 watt power supply that has it looks
like three 12-volt rails capable of 14
16 and 18 amps I don't have any clear
indication of which connectors are being
supplied by which 12-volt rails so
unfortunately I can't really give any
guidance there it looks again like I
said it's a standard ATX power supply so
it's non modular however what they've
done in terms of cable management to
keep things clean is we've got one let's
go ahead and let's pop this bad boy off
take off the front bezel there we go see
how this comes apart here yeah there we
go
so we've got oh look at that okay so
there's no cooling fan in the front
there's just a vent so it looks like we
are relying on cooling from the power
supply itself so there's an 80
millimeter fan in the power supply so
that's gonna dry air up here and that 92
millimeter fed in the back to do all the
cooling for the system so it's gonna
draw air in through the front here
that's the main intake presumably across
more exhaust from the video card so
it'll be a negative air pressure
situation inside the case
and then all of that will be exhausted
here here and here the cooler for the
CPU itself is an OEM affair so it's
looks like an 80 millimeter cooler could
also be 92 it looks like it looks like a
92 millimeter fan with 80 millimeter
holes is what it actually looks like on
a fairly standard looking until om
doodad here let's go ahead and pull the
rim and find out what we got here so
these are eight gig sticks of kingston
memory so you can tell from the kingston
branding on the chips themselves so this
is AC R 16 D 3 so they put 2 16 gig kits
that look like a custom Acer skew from
Kingston nice to see them shipping the
system with a ton of memory especially
given the way that memory prices have
been increasing lately this is a fairly
unique little deal right here I've never
seen one of these before so it's a
little tiny SSD that mounts on some kind
of I have no idea what standard that is
some kind of thing it's just a bare PCB
so it's 16 gigs it looks like it's a
SanDisk yeah SanDisk and then it uses
standard desktop SATA amounting hardware
so there you go you just plug that in
right there the hard drive itself is a
Seagate Barracuda 2 terabyte which is a
good choice and then there's this video
card which 8760 what the heck is in 8760
in terms of additional expansion you've
got one more PCI Express 1x down there
in the very bottom it's a custom Acer
motherboard in here although it kind of
baffles me why they need to implement a
custom board it really does look custom
like sometimes you'll see a a branded
board but you kind of look at it you go
oh yeah that's an Asus whatever the
model is whereas this actually just
doesn't look like anything that that
I've seen before let's go ahead and pull
this video card out maybe we should
throw this on our on our standard test
bench and find out how it performs in
terms of expansion right this is the
other thing I wanted to talk about
because these OEM systems you got a 500
watt power supply which means you could
conceivably check a gtx 680 in here
you've got a 6 plus 6 plus 2 so that's 6
and 8 pin PCIe power which is nice to
see you've got room for an additional 2
SATA connectors although I think one of
those
okay Rumble one of those has probably
run up here is like hey okay so there's
one going to the hot-swap one going to
blu-ray one going to the harddrive and
one going to the SSD so you got two more
available what else in terms of
extension expansion standard 24-pin it's
not quite seated all the way give that a
little push I think that's pretty much
it so here's this graphics card
I guess this thing model 87 62 gig so
it's like it's a standard sort of OEM
looking radio on part and I think that's
pretty much it so single six pin thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the Acer predator G Series
