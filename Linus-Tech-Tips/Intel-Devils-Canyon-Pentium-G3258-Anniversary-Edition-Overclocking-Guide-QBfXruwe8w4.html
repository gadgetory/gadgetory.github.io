anniversary edition overclocking guide
now the drawbacks of overclocking your
CPU are many overclockable hardware is
more expensive if it's done incorrectly
it can cause your computer to blue
screen or otherwise be unstable
it makes your PC consume more power and
output more heat it can make your
processor not last as long it voids the
warranty on any components and finally
doing it right can be downright
time-consuming so why do we do it
because we want to go fast now before we
get into this guide when it comes to
running things beyond their
specifications I don't think I have to
spell out that nothing is guaranteed so
with that out of the way let's get into
the parts we're using for our guide
today for the CPU we actually have two
different choices the first it's a 4790k
which is a quad-core with
hyper-threading clocked at a little
faster than the older 4770k from our
last overclocking guide at 4 gigahertz
base and up to 4 point 4 gigahertz boost
it features an upgraded thermal solution
for cooler temperatures versus its older
brother and due to refinements in
Intel's chip selection process promises
more consistent overclocking results a
fine choice oh and like its predecessor
it's a K series SKU which means it's
unlocked in overclocking ready which
leads us into our second CPU the pentium
g 32:58
anniversary edition this chip is truly
remarkable
it's not the fanciest thing in the world
with no hyper threading only two
processing cores and a mere 3.2
gigahertz stock clock speed but it's
unlocked which means maybe a massive
overclocking potential for cooling we're
using a corsair h 100 liquid cooler i
recommend a good tower air cooler or a
dual fan all in one liquid cooler for
the best overclocking results for our
power supply we've gone with the corsair
ax 850 we could have gone overkill with
the latest ax 1500 i but getting a great
overclock is not about having a high
wattage power supply as much as it's
about having a good quality one with
stable rails and very little ripple so
this one will be ok the ax 1500 i would
have been better but this one will be
fine speaking of overkill we've gone
slightly
or kill on the motherboard with a Z 97
WS from a soos both Luke and I are very
fond of WS series boards they're just so
dependable and easy to work with they
offer great compatibility with other
components amazing build quality while
they lack some of the fancy extras that
rog or tough series boards might have
they've got it where it counts
and they'll overclock with the best of
them these days the motherboard actually
doesn't affect overclocking results much
unless you're pushing things to the
limits with exotic cooling anyway so as
long as you pick and a soos motherboard
you should be able to follow along with
our guide exactly we have other brand
motherboards having similar options with
just a little bit more digging required
on your part to match up the stuff we're
changing to what it looks like on the
other board finally for memory we're
using an 8 gig kit of 20 400 megahertz
g.skill memory high speed memory isn't a
huge deal these days but how much less
expensive it's gotten lately compared to
standard 1600 megahertz stuff and how
easy it is to dial in at high
frequencies with XMP profiles we figured
what the heck it's optional but we'll
show it to you anyway ok line is enough
preamble how do i overclock step 1
don't overclock start by updating your
BIOS and drivers running a stress test
for an hour or two doing at least a
couple passes of mem test 86 and playing
games for a couple of hours to ensure
that things are functioning correctly
out of the box after all you wouldn't
take a new card on a track and try to go
200 kilometers an hour in it until you
made sure it can stay in a straight line
going 60 clicks right step 2 gather your
software toolkit while I mentioned I'm
test 86 already you're going to want a
couple of other things in your bag of
tricks for stress testing cpu-z lets you
see how your processor is running so you
can verify your settings and core
templates you monitor your CPUs
temperatures in real time to see if
they're getting out of hand if you want
an all-in-one utility and a nice user
friendly package I 264 gets a solid
recommendation from us it's what we use
and it includes monitoring stress
testing and diagnostic stuff but it does
cost money everything else I mentioned
is free step 3 set aside the time to do
it properly be prepared to have your
system not be usable for a day or two if
you want to correctly dial in an
overclock I'm not
saying it will take that long I'm just
saying it can take that long especially
if you're a real stickler about
validation I've seen stress testing
programs fail after even a full day of
burnin and my personal standard is that
if it's not a hundred percent stable I'd
rather turn it down a little rather than
risk losing valuable work and data so I
typically validate for 24 hours or more
step four the tour of the UEFI BIOS on
most motherboards pressing delete will
land you in the you fi BIOS if you're
not sure about your motherboard consult
the manual a soos drops you into a
simplified UEFI by default that gives
you all the basic info you need like
temperatures and lets you adjust your
fan speeds change boot order and enable
your memories X and P profiles but
doesn't really allow for any serious
tuning press f7 to get to Advanced Mode
most modern motherboard BIOS does have a
ton of features that we didn't have in
the old days you can navigate through
the menus manually or you can create
your own favorites menu with the
settings that you use most frequently
you can make quick notes as you progress
through your overclock and review them
later you can save profiles for known
good settings so it's easy to revert to
something that works when you're done
experimenting and you can even have the
motherboard take care of overclocking
for you on its own we're going to
experiment with that feature later on to
see how close it can get to the
performance of our manual overclock now
if you want a bit of a deeper rundown of
every setting things actually haven't
changed a lot since our last has well
overclocking guide in this guide we're
going to leave most of the dials on auto
and explain only the ones that we're
changing as we go let's jump into the AI
Tweaker heading where most of this stuff
is found
now most enthusiasts grade memory these
days has an XMPP profile and if you set
this setting to XMP it will dial in into
its optimal settings you can push memory
past it's rated speeds but because of
how difficult memory and stability is to
diagnose I really don't recommend doing
it unless you have a lot of patience
moving on down the CPU core ratio is
where most of the magic happens
this ratio times the base clock locked
at 100 megahertz for all intents and
purposes is how the processors final
frequency is derived as for the settings
here sync all cores is faster and easier
to dial in because it run
every pore at the same speed which is
easy to stress test but setting up
different maximum turbos depending on
how many cores are active could yield
slightly better results in dual or
single threaded applications we're going
to stick with single cores next up is
the CPU core voltage increasing core
voltage improves CPU stability at higher
clock speeds but higher voltages are
also the main reason that overclocking
causes higher temperatures and a shorter
life span for your processor now there
are actually several ways to set CPU
voltage we're going to use manual
voltage the generally regarded as pretty
safe voltage being one point three bolts
for Haswell base cps to find our max
overclock then to save power we're going
to switch to adaptive later on adaptive
gives us better power consumption
characteristics from the computer is not
working hard and ramps up whenever the
CPU needs more juice but it's not good
for stress testing when you're actually
validating the overclock because certain
stability testing applications can cause
voltage spikes that can hurt your CPU in
adaptive mode so now that we're familiar
with the settings that will be running
it's time to overclock we're going to
start by leaving our CPU at stock
voltage so 1.25 volts this is different
from Auto which will actually scale
voltage as you increase your frequencies
thanks to the same bios wizardry that
will automatically be handling all the
other settings in here that we didn't
cover then we're going to turn all of
our cores multiplier up a little bit
let's say 244 which would give us a
speed of 4 point 4 gigahertz actually
equal to what turbo boost will do on its
own but let's just see if it can do it
all the time so now we press f10 to save
our settings boot into Windows and do
some stability testing if the CPU passes
a short let's say 5 to 10 minute stress
test and temperatures are within your
comfort zone remember
higher temp equal shorter CPU lifespan
then we move back into the BIOS and push
it some more if it fails then we add a
bit more voltage and see if that makes
it stable it's important to go through
this process to find out where you're
needing to crank up the voltage a lot
for a very small CPU frequency return
that's the way to find the balance
between the longevity of your chip and
the extra performance that you crave
another thing to consider is the
conditions in which you're overclocking
is it optimal is it the worst case
scenario
overclock that you set up in the winter
might not work correctly in the summer
so leave yourself some buffer room or
save a couple of other profiles that
work in case you need to grab one of
them when the weather heats up another
thing to consider if you're working on
other more advanced settings within the
bios let's say you want to do some
tuning to the RAM timings is to throw
another step into the routine not
everything you tweak will have a
positive result so run a short benchmark
rather than just a stability test to see
if what you're doing is actually helping
or hindering performance once you've
dialed in your overclock using manual
voltage switch over to adaptive then use
a real-world stress test like Cinebench
to validate your load voltage I found
that just doing the math and keying in
the same number actually didn't work so
I used a I suite to make sure the
voltages were right and even though the
software voltage readouts are typically
not very accurate the system was stable
and my load temps were similar once I
turn things up a little bit more so it
seemed to work a digital multimeter
would actually be preferable if your
board has voltage check points though
that's a great feature for overclockers
unfortunately not found on WS boards so
following this methodology we achieved a
4.8 gigahertz on our 4790k at 1.3 volts
with a load CPU temperature of around 65
degrees and rock-solid stability and
want four point seven gigahertz on our G
32:58
at one point three six five volts with a
load CPU temperature of 49 degrees I
gave the Pentium about 0.06 5 volts more
than the typical best practice setting
for Haswell for a couple of reasons
number one is that temperatures were
still great since it's a dual core and
doesn't output much heat and number two
is that as a $75 chip I'm a little bit
more willing to live on the wild side
with it both of these results are going
to turn into some significant real-world
performance improvements but by now you
might be saying they're kind of going
well Linus this is all fine and good but
ain't nobody got time for that
is there another way well actually there
are two other ways that I alluded to
before to overclock on an asus
motherboard number one is to simply
navigate to the easy tuning wizard in
the bios answer a couple short questions
about your setup and let the bore
apply one of the pre-done profiles that
a Souza's engineers have cooked up this
resulted in a lower more conservative
overclocks at higher temperatures for
both of our chips temps were still
reasonable at only a couple of more
degrees on both CPUs but it's just plain
not as good as a manual overclock the
second alternative way is to use a CSIS
AI suite software's 5 way optimization
feature to have the board overclock
itself it actually goes through much the
same increased speed until unstable then
increased voltage until stable rinse and
repeat process that we did except it
does it completely on its own and it
actually works reasonably well the
automated system ended up a hundred
megahertz slower on my 4790k and one
hundred megahertz faster on my D 32:58
with the only issue being that in both
cases it was applying more voltage than
I was really comfortable with and since
I'd already tested the system and found
it to be stable with less voltage it
seems like a soos was overdoing it a bit
in both cases not a huge deal if you
just want a quick and dirty overclock
since it can dial it in in about 10
minutes and you don't even need to touch
it and they were both stable it's just
not the proper way to do things either
and that pretty much wraps it up thanks
