flexible blue LED strip it is designed
to match your style which is good
because my style is so cool and this is
a very cool product the unboxing itself
is actually going to be fairly
unimpressive today it has an operating
voltage of DC 12 volts it has an input
of DC 12 volts via a molex 4 pin and an
output power of 3.6 and watts I don't
know how it outputs power maybe they
mean the actual power consumption I'm
not sure what they're going for here the
color is blue the LED is 26 pieces and
the length is 360 millimeters or 36
centimeters if you prefer this is what
it looks like and it's like I said not
really very impressive until we plug it
in which we'll do in a minute here's the
LED strip you can see it is quite
flexible comes with adhesive backing
well on the back and check this out you
can actually cut it anywhere you want
and then solder on new wires so all
these little points where there are
scissors you can just cut it and then
you can have like four LEDs if you want
and then you can you can just solder on
new leads and have as many in a row as
you want so you can cut them up in 2 4 6
8 10 etc onto the end and so these are
great for case lighting because they're
a lot thinner then fluorescent tubes and
they don't require an inverter so that
means you can just plug them right into
molex and look at that they're like
super bright can I even turn off the
light in my office what the answer is no
but you can see these are quite bright
they light things up so if you were to
install these in your case they would
light things up really well you can run
them in kind of difficult to reach
places and get like some cool lighting
effects so you can put them out a fan
and they'll look all cool you can put
them in between graphics cards then
it'll look all cool in there anyway I
think these are cool they're kind of
expensive but definitely cool they're
available in a variety of different
colors including red blue white and I
believe
