Joel Zimmerman aka deadmau5 invited us
out here to hang for the day and give
you guys a peek at the tech setup of one
of the world's most iconic electronic
music artists spoiler alert this guy is
a big huge nerd and this place is
flippin awesome
okay now I know everybody else setting
foot into this castle would start with
the you know taxidermy route with oh I
don't know the taxidermy room or maybe
the garage of supercars but not me
I'm starting where the magic happens if
you know what I mean
the master bedroom and that is an
entirely appropriate thing in this case
because deadmau5 has turned it into one
of the only Dolby Atmos Nick studios
outside of Dolby themselves you actually
need a special black box that he
wouldn't tell me serve out in addition
to the nine custom-made speakers from
ATC that are perfectly positioned in the
room in order to master audio in 3d
space remember Atmos can scale to
hundreds of speakers surrounding the
viewer this room have actually been
under construction for three years and
it's still not quite done but it's
really close I mean to be clear slapping
a Macbook on the table and chilling out
to some sick jams in here is as the kids
say dope AF but it's about like playing
cs:go on a super computer compared to
what it will be capable of and this is
really cool so this entire room is
actually suspended from what used to be
a vaulted ceiling this was done for a
couple of reasons number one for
improved acoustics and number two so
that with access panels under the floor
the like 800 cables for these pad panels
here or be like banging you know optical
DisplayPort cables for the monitors that
are going to be installed here can all
be run without disturbing the rooms
otherwise pristine aesthetic as the gear
in here is freaking on real so the Neve
analog console in the center here would
run you about a half a million dollars
as configured and honestly that
just to take in the inputs apply some EQ
and compression and adjust levels and
check out these walls on the left and
right of the center console are
different variations of what are called
analog modular systems now a lot of
folks would produce electronic music
exclusively on a computer through
software these days but you have to
remember that those would be digital
reproductions of what is inherently an
analogue thing so this wall here is the
culmination of over five years of
curating and collecting tone generators
sequencers filters I mean you name it
this one's called the modulation or G
how can you not get one of them and Joel
was kind enough to give us an in-person
demo of how something like this works so
here's my hip and then plug it into
there and then that's the input and then
we want to go give you an 80 DB output
for a filter so I'm just going from one
module to the other if I just say and oh
now I want to change the pitch of it to
be like a tune right so this is a 1v
acht
which means one volt per octave I can
get these little nuances of turning
these analog dials and creating these
sounds that subconsciously you probably
know aren't quite right you know which
is me now he obviously doesn't use that
for everything I mean it's the digital
era but from an artistic standpoint
what's great is having options an apply
voltage on a stepless dial provides
practically speaking infinite options
which I guess leads us into why there
are over a dozen synthesizers in this
room now to the stupid layperson one
middle C equals another middle C but
that is not the case all of these have
different tonal properties and many of
them have unbelievable stories this Juno
106 worth about 1,500 bucks he got for
$20 at a pawn shop from some guy who
didn't know what it was this Jupiter 8
and this prophet 10 down here these are
really really hard to get your hands on
today because they were built in the
seventies using components that even if
the manufacturer wanted to they couldn't
build this stuff again because that
stuff's not available today and they
have this unique retro tonality that
like for example when they went to do
stranger things they had to use this
equipment because we still don't have
the capability to emulate what B sound
like electronically but these guys would
have gone for a couple hundred bucks in
the 70s now there were tens of thousands
of dollars this one that folds up in a
briefcase right here this is r2d2 I
don't mean this is the same model that
was our 2d - this was our 2d - it still
works and to say this place sounds
freaking amazing would be felling it
short I mean I only even got to listen
to a couple of tracks on the stereo
speakers but my god it is an audio
listening experience the likes of which
I have never come even close to and all
of that that's just the surface level
let's head down to the dungeon of this
modern-day castle first up is the land
center because why wouldn't you need a
land center in your basement this is a
boat as tricked-out as it gets five a
small form-factor custom-built machines
from Nvidia with the case is customized
by PC junkie mugs to match get this to
match
Joel's cars every single one of them is
also running a black magic micro 4k
camera for game streaming and the
capture machine for his game streaming
setup here is actually running under
this like center pentagram console thing
that I'm standing on and it's hooked
into their 10 gigabit home networking
solution you heard me right I found the
only other person in Canada with a
server room in his freaking house I
couldn't be more excited to tell you
that it's actually quite a little bit
maybe quite a bit better than mine not
that it's the competition not that I'm
upset it's just that that is where the
two gigabit internet
connection comes in from the 103 foot
Tower with ubiquity freaking dishes on
the top out in the yard this one right
here this is a custom box with six beams
and vineya Tesla's in it that sounds
like a freaking jet taking off and this
guy right here this 45 drive store
inator is actually the reason this was
the this was the springboard for this
whole collab because Joel reached out to
me about a year ago now asking for some
math advice so I got him hooked up with
the guys at unrep and now he's all set
up with 70 terabytes of of course highly
expandable storage for all of his music
and actually not come to think of it do
music files really take up that much
space would you even know now of course
they don't but the answer the real
answer is really freaking cool now I
have to confess I never really gave a
lot of thought to well how do the
graphics on the cube or the helmet sync
with the music I just assumed that it
was farmed out to some expensive
Hollywood production house and that it
was just kind of done by magic but no
Joel and his team actually build a lot
of these tools and effects in-house
including 3d modeling so most of those
gaming machines over there like when
there are no friends over playing rocket
League are actually being used as render
nodes and this is in addition to the
Tesla's in the server room there are a
total of I think it's 43 NVIDIA GPUs in
this house that are all used for
rendering so one of the animations for
the cube that Joel showed us was
actually recorded using motion cap from
like his Microsoft Kinect then he used a
model from non-stock night redid the
head and animated it using cinema 4d
then rendered it out using octane and
the visualizations and the
synchronization to like the head which
by the way I
absolutely did get to where there is
exactly as much sweat in there as you
would imagine
we're designed by him and his crew as
well and if you're a networking nerd
this is where it gets even cooler
so this massive touchscreen that's a
relic of Microsoft's acquisition of
perceptive pixel they're only four in
the world by the way can be used through
the network and some custom software
that him the team developed to allow
audio effects and animations to be
controlled in real time on a massive
touchscreen so pretty much the entire
show can be run out of this box with a
couple of map pros with this nifty mount
on it and this front house mixer well I
hope that this whole thing has been at
least 30% of fun for you guys as it has
been for me because I think it's been
pretty fucking fun thank you to you guys
for watching thank you so much - oh he's
standing out in the in the driveway over
there but he's waving he I definitely
had permission to do all of this thanks
to Joel for allowing us to hang out here
for the day and I guess that's pretty
much it if you like this video hit that
