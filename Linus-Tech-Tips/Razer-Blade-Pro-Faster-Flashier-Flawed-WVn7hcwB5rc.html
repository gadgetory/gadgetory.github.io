Pro to be available to customers to take
aim at apples use of the pro moniker on
a product that didn't even have an SD
card reader but in a sense apples
correct in their assertion that Pro can
have a lot of different meanings an
audio production professional has an
entirely different set of needs from a
professional gamer so who is the razor
blade Pro for and at 3700 to 4500 US
dollars will anyone buy one these are
both very good questions that I will try
to answer
verdaguer gonna make a sand + lines of
gaming chairs make for a great addition
to any gaming setup check them out at
the link in the video description the
blade pro outwardly has a lot in common
with the ancestor i unboxed four and a
half years ago it's a 17 inch class
device with an all aluminum unibody
construction it's got subtle contour on
the lid and a black on black color
scheme for style and it's got an 0.8
eighth inch thickness that makes it much
sleeker looking and feeling than a
typical desktop replacement once we get
past the surface however it becomes
abundantly clear what razor has been
working on for almost half a decade
instead of some namby-pamby mid tier
graphics card and a dual-core CPU razer
has stuffed all of this into the 2016
blade pro with the standouts being the
raid 0 PCIe nvme SSD storage
configuration from the top to the bottom
of the lineup and the top-of-the-line
desktop grade gtx 1088 gig graphics
solution from nvidia and there's a solid
mix of i/o to boot with the highlights
for pro users being the integrated SD
reader hdmi 2.0 output with 7.1 codec
support Gigabit Ethernet and a
Thunderbolt 3 port that allows the blade
pro to be connected to a wide variety of
external storage devices or other high
end peripherals though curiously razer
is not officially supporting their own
razer core external GPU enclosure
presumably because there wouldn't be
much to upgrade to i mean to say this
thing flies would be a gross
understatement games productivity
content creation it chews through it all
there are a lot of laptops out there
with 4k displays at this point but
almost all of them including the also
pretty sleek though still thicker EVGA
SC 17 have suffered from the same fatal
flaw they don't have the
horses to properly drive that kind of
resolution but these thermal results and
gaming benchmarks should show that the
blade pro is ready to deliver a
comfortable experience in even the most
demanding Triple A games with razors
inclusion of Nvidia g-sync adaptive
refresh technology going a long way
towards smoothing out the appearance of
on-screen animations even down to around
40 frames per second but back to one of
my earlier questions cramming a gtx 1080
into any household object turns it into
a suitable device for professional
gamers but what has razer done to draw
in other professionals we'll start with
the display touchscreen nice to have
solid IPS like viewing angles nice to
have to a greater than 1000 to 1
contrast ratio with 99 percent Adobe RGB
coverage now you're getting my attention
this means more creative possibilities
in programs like Adobe Creative Cloud
with support for this wider color space
but based on these values not out of the
box a delta e of greater than 2 is
considered not accurate so a calibration
tool would be necessary before doing
even basic color grading work let's move
on now to the human interface aspect of
the blade Pro the switchblade interfaces
touch screen monitor touch pad and mini
display programmable buttons from the
original blade pro are gone
Razer says this was to make room for
more internal components but I think
it's because they've had this time to
reflect on the usefulness of
programmable gaming keys above a touch
pad but one thing that does remain is
the curious positioning of the trackpad
along with the integrated scroll or
volume wheel and media keys what the
hell was Razer thinking with this I
think they were thinking yeah most
people will get used to it
and actually for most purposes I kind of
did the dead zone at the bottom
shouldn't be there it's uncomfortable to
use two-handed so
I run out of pad when clicking and
dragging stuff over long distances and
respect to Apple for their haptic touch
pads the long travel down distance makes
the pointer move sometimes when I'm
trying to click but it is far from
unusable and number two they were
thinking they wanted to cram a maximum
legal limit 99 watt hour battery into
the wrist rest giving the blade pro very
solid battery life for a desktop
replacement class product about 75% of
the Dell XPS pro in my usual tests and
about equal to its smaller brother the
blade in a gaming test so the touchpad
ends up being kind of a neutral point
for me but what about the keyboard well
this might cost me early access to the
next big razor blade launch but it has
to be said loud and clear so they learn
sure it's reprogrammable and synapse
it's got RGB or whatever but this thing
is abominable you don't have to move a
lot to seriously impede a strong touch
typists ability to get anything done on
a keyboard and while I've been asking
razor for full-sized arrow keys for some
time now this is not a price I'm willing
to pay for them making matters worse
razor 65 gram mechanical key switches
are among the worst I've encountered in
a long time
I already don't prefer the heavily
front-loaded tactile bump and mushy
follow-through but it's the
inconsistency in feel from key to key
that really make it impossible to
maintain accuracy at speed you can even
hear it listen to how different these
keys right next to each other sound
there's no hiding behind optimized for
gaming as a defense this time this is a
bad keyboard on that note thanks to some
extra porting the compressed speakers
actually sound pretty good but on the
subject of acoustics the blade pro
carries on the tradition of the blade
song as I like to call it being
tolerable at idle but very loud under
heavy loads when a lot of airflow is
needed leading then to the answer to my
second question would anyone buy one
this is a product that has some
noticeable warts I personally vow to
never buy a razer product with this
keyboard design but it's one that also
has some utterly unique selling points
like its small power brick specially for
a laptop of this power its Adobe RGB
screen and it's jaw-dropping performance
in what is a larger and heavier compared
to the blade but legitimately portable
and even sexy form factor so are there
