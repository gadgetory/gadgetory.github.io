the CES 2017 miniature high performance
graphics cards have been around for a
while now but were largely popularized
by the performance and thermals of the
970 mini now in 2017 ZOTAC has
introduced in 8.3 inch 1080 mini
performance wise it's basically the same
as a reference card but with a tiny
boost its base clock is running at
sixteen hundred and twenty megahertz and
it's boost clock is running at seventeen
hundred and fifty nine megahertz about
33 megahertz higher in terms of boost
clock video input wise it is the same as
reference with three DisplayPort 1.4
connectors one HDMI 2.0 B connector and
a dual link DVI connector for cooling
the fans are actually different the fan
on the left is a 90 millimeter static
optimized fan the fan on the right is a
100 millimeter airflow optimized fan and
the blades on each fan are different to
correspond with that there's a bit more
of a curve on the static pressure
optimized one below that on the custom
PCB of a five plus one power phase
design and a standard 180 watt TDP this
card should enable even more people to
dive into small but ultra high
performance ITX pcs which I personally
find quite exciting because it's an
interesting realm for computers to go
into and I will say the price is unknown
but is speculated to be somewhere around
the cost of a reference card and for
thermals at load it should be about 74
degrees
also if you're looking at aesthetic
stuff there are white lights on the card
and the front shroud and the back are
both metal and next up we have the VR go
back pack which is a much more elegant
solution to tether free VR instead of
that kind of like thrown together laptop
on your back thing that I've done in the
past this is actually easy to use and
can be used as a standard desktop as
well which is rather cool it includes
two hot swappable spots for batteries
you can remove one at a time to keep the
system running completely if you want to
have one charging and one in the unit
like we do now or if you get a hold
another set of batteries you could run
two in the backpack for two hours of
play and have two charging which takes
two hours to charge and swap those in
and out for continuous play it has spots
built in for all your gear so you can
have your controllers and nice little
hole
spots on the side as well as your cable
and you can even hang your headset off
of the clip on the other side as well if
you do want to convert it into desktop
mode it's a relatively easy process just
take the backpack off lay it down
somewhere like this conveniently placed
table pull up the velcro tab turn the
dial into the unlocked position slide
downwards and the backpack portion comes
off to put it back on it's the exact
same process but in Reverse lay the
backpack portion down slide it up turn
the dial put the velcro thing down and
you're done if you're looking into
