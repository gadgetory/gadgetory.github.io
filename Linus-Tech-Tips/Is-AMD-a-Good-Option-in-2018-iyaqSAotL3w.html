always a generation or three behind to
blindsiding Intel with their shockingly
competitive first gen Rison processors
based on their all news in architecture
fast forward a year and second gen
rising with Zen plus has been around for
a few months now with no response from
the blue team yet but in spite of all of
this among many enthusiasts there's
still this attitude that persists that
goes well if you're not poor people then
you should just get Intel so we decided
to challenge that perception and we've
got some interesting findings to share
with you today after we tell you about
glass wire glass wire is a firewall that
displays your PC and Android devices
incoming and outgoing network
connections in real time use offer code
Linus and get 25% off glass wire 2.0
through the link below
we know that some of you are just gonna
skip to the conclusion anyway so we're
gonna make your life easier the short
answer is yes AMD is a viable
alternative to Intel but the long answer
has a few what's in it now initially we
had wanted to do an in-depth exploration
into things like cache hierarchies and
IMC peculiarities plus you know did you
know like infinity fabric connecting the
dyes inside of Rison running at half of
the memory clock but I mean let's face
it if you guys cared about that kind of
stuff you'd be watching gamers Nexus so
we're gonna focus on the results frames
per second in games render times and
professional applications and a side
dish of power consumption and storage
before we even get there though we need
to talk about price when we built up and
priced out over two competing test
benches it became obvious why some
people see AMD as the the poor man's
choice between Intel's higher CPU price
and lack of a decent included cooler on
their case series chips our AMD platform
was over $60 cheaper finally you guys
probably noticed that we're running at
different memory speeds Intel's IMC
actually does tend to handle high
frequency kids better than AMD's but
their spec is actually more conservative
and we're leaving overclocking out of
this comparison today so this is bone
stock apples versus officially supported
apples first up then is our gaming
benchmarks in a huge surprise to only
the small group of AMD fanboys who
insist on remaining willfully ignorant
for some reason in the overwhelming
majority of cases Intel's 8700 K defeats
the rise in 720 700 X and in some cases
like in GTA 5 by a substantial margin I
mean I'm talking twenty to thirty
percent greater performance depending on
the resolution not 4k result really
stands out I mean bad is a resolution
that should be GPU bound on pretty much
any
processor if our recent video about
system bottlenecks
is anything to go by with that in mind
you can put down your pitchforks hashtag
AMD Red Team because we are going to
point out that not once did we encounter
a situation where our gaming experience
at the same graphical settings of course
went from playable on the 8700 K to
unplayable on Rison it just doesn't
change that the 8700 K is better for
gaming . and that's even before you get
into anomalies like csgo for the record
in our testing enabling gaming mode via
am DS rise and master software actually
dropped the FPS across the board with
like two exceptions and requires a
restart in between modes so we're not
huge fans of it
our risin 720 700 X did win in some of
the synthetic gaming benchmarks though
thanks to its two extra cores which
doesn't indicate anything about real
games but does foreshadow our
productivity results out of the eleven
tests we ran AMD's offering outright 1:9
sometimes putting significant distance
between itself and the blue team I mean
7-zip was 50 percent faster which it
should be noted does affect aspects of
your systems performance beyond just
unzipping the files you download from
the internet asus real bench encoding
was 32 percent faster while
multi-threaded Cinebench was 28 percent
faster
I mean Intel did remind AMD who the
single threaded boss was by beating it
by fifteen percent in single threaded
Cinebench but that was its only win with
our last result the real bench image
editing test almost as close as the
results of the last scrapyard Wars so
basically a tie depending on who you ask
but there's more to life than CPU
performance let's take a look at some of
the quality of life differences one
thing that we noticed was that game load
times were affected when we moved
between platforms even
the exact same drive we found a variance
of up to 15% each way with Intel on
average ending up about 5% faster than
AMD and like the differences in gaming
benchmarks this isn't something that you
would immediately notice in a in a Pepsi
challenge taste test but it is their
power consumption was also about 10
watts hired idle and 20 watts higher
under load on the AMD platform finally
we wanted to touch on the accelerated
storage options that each platform
features because we really feel that
this is an excellent way to get better
than hard drive performance while not
giving up on capacity now we did a more
in-depth piece on this a little while
ago but in summary intel has obtained
caching which we have seen work wonders
on game load times and then from our
testing AMD's store mi is more
cumbersome to use with some unpleasant
limitations though the big winner if you
watch that video which you probably
should was actually a third-party
software called primo cache so there you
have it Andy is a less expensive
solution compared to Intel and it mostly
loses in gaming so you know what the
trolling from the gaming crowd about AMD
being a second-rate solution mat does
have some merit to it unfortunately but
the easy comeback is well it's great
that your machine games faster but I've
got real work to do and if that is
actually true of you then Andy is a
great choice I mean really the only
thing that could disqualify either of
them at this point is platform stability
and Rison has matured a lot since its
initial launch to the point where as
long as you don't need store my the
final answer comes down to what your mix
is and as usual it depends are you a
sixty percent productivity person who
games on the side go risin and don't
look back you saved a buck but you still
got a great system what's wrong with
that meanwhile are you the gamer who
throws together the occasional headshot
compilation vid
well you might want to consider paying
the intel tax with new graphics cards
comes more FPS that can be unlocked with
a faster gaming CPU
speaking of faster I'm gonna get to the
sponsor spot right away we all have our
everyday grooming routine showering
brushing your teeth and yes of course
shaving and not just your face it's not
a friend one of my signature moves is
pre-soaking my toothbrush so that I can
get a lot more mileage out of them
before they start to feel too stiff but
no matter what your routine is Dollar
Shave Club yes that one has everything
you need toothpaste body wash razors etc
to help you look feel and smell your
best and Dollar Shave Club is basically
giving away their daily essentials
starter set to new members for just 5
bucks
it's got trial sized versions of their
most popular products including their
shave butter their body wash and their
one wipe Charlies and it even includes
their executive razor which has a
premium weighty handle and a full
cassette of cartridges after the first
box replacement cartridges are sent for
just a few bucks a month so don't wait
check it out at the link in the video

slash Lynas so thanks for watching guys
if you just liked this video hit that
button but if you liked it hit like guys
subscribe maybe consider checking out
where to buy the little stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description also link down there's our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should totally join contact but you
didn't know this oh wait no nevermind
