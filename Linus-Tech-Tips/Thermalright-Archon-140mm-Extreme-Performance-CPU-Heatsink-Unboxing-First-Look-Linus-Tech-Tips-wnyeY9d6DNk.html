pretty new product I actually know
nothing about this I am going in cold on
the archon CPU cooler from thermal right
so you can see it comes in their
traditional Brown box packaging because
thermal writes philosophy is spend money
on developing the product and making it
awesome and not on developing the box
and making it awesome the performance
should speak for itself we've got a
thermal write sticker included we also
have instruction guides for LGA 775 1156
and 1366 as well as a.m. 2 a.m. 2 plus n
a.m. 3 and then we have a little
assembly package contents list e thing
so here is all of our stuff for Intel
here's our stuff for AMD here's our
common components and some more common
components including a tool fan clips
for duel fans as well as thermal
compound and I have no idea I guess
we'll find out so the first thing we
find in the box is a thermal write fan
so this is a 140 millimeter fan alright
it has a sleeve cable which uses a
pretty good quality sleeving it's a four
pin PWM fin and what I'm just gonna go
ahead and take that off I actually have
one of these already it's quite quiet
I'm really pleased with the overall
quality of this fan and I'm very very
fussy about fans I'll have you guys know
that's why I use a quadruple and a dual
radiator in my own machine at home in
order to cool a CPU in a single graphics
card it's all about having silent silent
performance for me so thermal write is
obviously a pretty good choice alright
what do we got here we have accessories
so this is gonna be everything that was
on that little list so let's go ahead
and dump this out and find out what we
got oh and this is going to be the open
oh it was going to be the debut of my
new unboxing knife but instead it will
just be me borrowing the crazy Russians
knife and
opening this up alright cool so the
first thing let's talk about these these
are little rubber pads that you put on
the corners of your fans to keep them
from transferring vibrations to your CPU
cooler did I mention thermal right is
optimized for quiet performance
these are little rubber pieces as far as
I know these have the same effect so I
guess they're giving you two options
hold on maybe I'm missing something here
why don't we find out there's only one
way to know for sure so what are they
saying those are for well this is
madness I thought they were for the same
thing there's nothing in the
instructions about it okay well moving
forward I will assume therefore the same
thing here's our fan clips so we have
four wire clips to mount two fans so we
can run this in push-pull we have our
included tool which has a wrench as well
as another more different wrench okay we
have our little thumb screw here we have
came out of here so this is the hold
down for tightening it down right there
alright and that's what that wrench is
for one of the sides anyway here we have
our AMD mounting hardware
I love thermal writes mounting hardware
because everything is solid I mean here
look it's all made out of like steel you
can't you can't bend it it doesn't Bend
it's falling you've got a nice thick
backplate nice thick hold down plate
same goes for the Intel you've got these
nice the old back plates and hold down
plates that means that not only oh yeah
thermal compound as well that means that
not only is the system going to be a
hundred percent okay when it's sitting
in one place in terms of not falling off
your motherboard but even you can ship
thermal alright coolers at NCIX the
store where I work hopefully most of you
know that by now we actually do ship a
lot of systems and thermal right
coolers are among the best ones for
shipping because even though they're
heavy and bulky they use an appropriate
mounting system that doesn't rely on
wussy push pins or anything like that in
order to ensure that nothing bad happens
during shipping because you've got a lot
of weight hanging off your socket so if
you reinforce it with a good backplate
and a solid hold down that's going to go
a long way towards having it not fall
off so this thing is monstrous look at
this okay well we'll do the obligatory
finger shot which you can see is just
and it completely a mirror finish so I'm
just gonna have a quick look this is a
convex base I can tell from looking at
my reflection back at me which means
that the very middle of it is slightly
higher than the outsides and so combined
with their high pressure mounting system
which you can see right here that gives
you optimal contact with the CPU
directly over the die under the heat
spreader where all of the heat is being
produced so that is why they've gone
with that particular design
characteristic of the archon heat sink
now this is clearly a 140 millimeter
heat sink because it's clearly bigger
than a 120 millimeter heat sink and it
uses a whopping six heat pipes in a
u-shape so that means you have
effectively 12 heat pipes to transfer
heat all along this heat sink but one
thing I also want you guys to note here
if you see how there's a bit of a gap in
the middle that's for a very good reason
because no matter what fan you're
putting on it most of the cooling most
of the airflow is going to be at the
outside so you can see right over that
fan hub so the hub is this part in the
middle there's no heat pipes carrying
heat and then as soon as we get out
where the blades are gonna be blowing
air we've got lots of heat pipes so
we've got actually dual ranks of heat
pipes times three six heat pipes up each
side of the arcon cooler the top uses
kind of a matte finish okay but very
very slick very professional-looking but
not very shiny okay compared to the base
which is extremely shiny and the heat
pipes use sort of a semi shiny finish on
them we've also got some interesting
some other interesting aspects here so
instead of going with a completely
straight fin thermal wright has actually
done a couple of things they
taken the fins and they've bent them
like this which is going to give you
slightly more surface area and slightly
more turbulence when you're blowing air
through it and then they've also gone
and that ridged them a little bit this
way so that from my experience anyway
and from what I've seen is able to allow
you to reduce the noise slightly by
making the air flow going through it
making the heat sink slightly more
aerodynamic as you push the air through
it so it's a fine line because you want
to increase turbulence to get better
cooling remember more turbulence is more
cooling if you had fins that were wavy
like this throughout the whole thing
that would give you better cooling than
straight fins or even slightly rippled
fins but you would really sacrifice on
the noise because moving the air around
like that makes it a lot more bushy
sounding a lot more noisy so thank you
