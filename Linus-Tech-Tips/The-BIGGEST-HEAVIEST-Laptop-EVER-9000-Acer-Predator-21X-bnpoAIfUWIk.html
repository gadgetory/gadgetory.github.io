coverage this year check out their
awesome skins at the link below here we
are in the Acer booth and here it is in
the flesh the laptop that many would
have called impossible but I now that
I've seen that it is indeed possible
would simply call very very very highly
improbable this is it it is a 21 inch
laptop with a curved 2560 by 1080 120
Hertz display a Cherry MX brown
mechanical keyboard with full
individually controlled and backlit RGB
lighting a right-handed right sided
touchpad Aurel look at that it can also
have a number pad that is also
individually lit but regrettably not
Cherry MX brown keys which I mean Acer
you guys got to get your stuff together
he's not even mechanical keys and it's
got a balls-to-the-wall
io including a couple USB fries on the
right a Kensington lock you lock this
baby up because otherwise someone's
gonna walk off with it and gain a few
pounds of arm bulk in the process I mean
look at my arms I'm not flexing I'm just
holding the laptop we got two more USB
3s on the Left dedicated headphone and
microphone audio jacks an SD card reader
and oh this is where it gets real right
around the back here where you got to
power plugs in for two 330 watt bricks
more on that later gigabit ethernet
Thunderbolt 3 2 DisplayPort 1.2 is HDMI
2.0 and a whole lot of ventilation so
why does it need five fans and nine
internal heat pipes that's a great
question
it comes down to specs inside the
predator 21 X you will find a core i7 78
20 HK that is an overclockable chip Acer
didn't give any specific reason why they
didn't just go with a desktop chip like
I've seen done in these
times of machines before but there you
go it's got 64 gigs of DDR for dual
channel memory 2 GTX 1080s and SLI each
with 8 gigs of gddr5 X it's got on one
terabyte nvme SSD raid 0 configuration
with a 1 terabyte hard drive that is
actually the memory and all the drive
slots are pretty easy to get at so
you've got a couple more spare SATA and
got 2 slots available and the CPU and
GPU are both overclockable but what is
that overclocking translate to well our
benchmark results actually went down in
Unigine valley but I think that speaks
to the pre-production nature of this
machine not to the insufficient thermals
because the temperatures of the GPUs
while running these tests were flippin
unbelievable we're not even reaching the
80 degree limit of the GTX 1080 so I
would expect that even though they don't
have any details for me at this time
these might even be full TDP 10 ATS in a
laptop form factor though it would be
fairly generous to call this a laptop
form factor there's only one
configuration the highest end
configuration but quite frankly I agree
with Acer's decision as much as consumer
choice is important quite frankly I
think anyone spending $8,000 on a laptop
is probably willing to spend $9,000 on a
laptop because they're going for the
best of the best and that's what this
puppy is gonna cost you at least in the
US so wow that is a thing it's real it
is not a PR stunt I mean it might still
be a PR stunt but it's a real one that
you can actually hold I mean look how
thick this thing is so thanks for
watching our coverage of the predator 21
X here at the Acer booth at CES 2017 and
a huge shout-out to our sponsor for this
