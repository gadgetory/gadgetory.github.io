eclectic pile of hardware and go what a
piece of junk but for me everything on
this table holds a very special place in
my heart because what you're looking at
is after hours of scouring eBay free
geek Craigslist basically - a piece my
first gaming rig
so if you were building a gaming machine
on a budget back when I was in high
school
AMD was a very compelling option the
chips were cheaper the boards were
cheaper and this was actually the
deciding factor for me thanks to a
collaboration with Nvidia which is
probably a hard thing for our younger
viewers to imagine given what bitter
enemies they've become since AMD's
acquisition of ati back in 2006 they had
much better onboard graphics than you
could get on an Intel chipset and so I
decided on my weapon of choice the SOL
Tech SL 75 M RN l the crappier onboard
graphics version of the famous FR NL &amp;amp;
FR n2l whose budget overclocking prowess
was second only to their amazing sense
of style that is until Sol Tech went out
of business only a few short years later
thanks to their use of shoddy
electrolytic capacitors that pretty much
all leaked just outside of the warranty
period I mean actually it's a miracle I
found a working one of these I could
have substituted some other board with
GeForce 4 MX graphics onboard but to
preserve the integrity of the build I
way overpaid some jackass who runs an
eBay store who thought this thing was
worth over $100 because I tweeted I was
looking for one so his listing got a
bunch of hits Oh
next up is my CPU the legendary Athlon
XP 2500 plus AMD marketed this processor
quite cleverly but branding was similar
to Microsoft's then brand spanking new
Windows XP and used the PR model number
system to compare the lower clocked but
higher IPC Athlon chips to intel's
gigahertz marketed Pentium 4 family it
ran a double-pumped 16 66 megahertz
frontside bus effectively 333 megahertz
and featured 512 kilobytes of cache with
a clock speed of 1.8 3 gigahertz and was
a well known excellent budget
overclocker with an unlocked multiplier
that allowed basically all of them to
run at 3200 Plus speeds or about 2.2
gigahertz k7 was notably the last gender
raishin of AMD chips to use a frontside
bus before they changed everything
industry-wide by moving the memory
controller on board with the Athlon 64
physically it looked very different from
modern cpus the die was completely
exposed with only some rubber pads
around it to prevent it from chipping or
cracking during heatsink installation
you can see this one is quite chipped so
yeah they didn't always work very well
and the pin layout on the bottom is very
retro looking socket a has 462 pins on
the bottom laughable when you compare it
to a modern APU that has over 900 pins
in a much smaller area and a similar
size modern intel chip that uses LGA
type contact pads rather than pins to
improve durability and pin density and
squeezes over 2,000 in about the same
area more pins are used for additional
signaling to the motherboard and other
system components for these more
advanced processors cooling and
overclocking of my 68 watt beast was
taken care of by a very unique product
this is the van tech Aero flow one of
the only CPU coolers at least on the
desktop to feature a tip magnetic drive
fan TMD fans have the benefit of being
able to use more of their area for
cooling because the center hub contains
no motor only a bearing and the tips of
the fan blades actually have magnets
that are driven by coils in the frame of
the fan cool huh less cool is the fact
that they vibrate like crazy
and they're loud and on top of that
because of AMD's mounting system in
those days putting this thing on sucks
so the CPU die isn't actually centered
between these two fragile plastic
mounting clip things so the heatsink
needs a cutout on the one side for the
the hinge for the retention arm on the
socket and only goes on one way then you
actually needed to like seriously this
was the intended way to install a
heatsink in those days put a screwdriver
into this notch on the other
side and sweat bullets while heaving
down on it to pull the latch over the
clips and then move it slightly to lock
on to them I mean there were so many oMG
I put my screwdriver through my
motherboard posts on the forums in those
days my RAM choice was dictated by what
was cheap at MCI X at the time so this
Samsung 512 megabyte DDR 400 stick that
I got from free week actually still has
the NCIX barcode sticker on it and is
exactly what I used in fact it could be
the exact stick that I had for all I
know I opted for a single stick even
though this platform is dual channel
capable to give myself more room to
increase the capacity of my rig in the
future technically three sticks could be
run in dual channel on this platform
with one stick twice the capacity of the
other two but it was a pledgie solution
and not guaranteed to work the case and
power supply is where I really have to
take a moment to thank free geek the
guys that we did this collab with for
hooking me up even Antec didn't have an
original land boy buried in the
catacombs and I could not find one of
these they took those guys like two
weeks to find one and set it aside for
me thanks guys the original land boy
before they sullied the name with this
nonsense was the bomb it was made of
aluminum very cool for the time it was
affordable it included not just a power
supply but and this was a huge deal
especially then a decent 350 watt power
supply with blue LED lighting and while
it may not have featured literally any
room for cable management or even front
panel audio it did have a removable
three and a half inch drive cage for
easy harddrive and floppy installation
easy install sleds for the optical drive
and a side panel window to show off the
aftermarket 80 millimeter blue LED fan
that I bought on an impulse like two
weeks later at London drugs officially
my first way overpriced
computer modeling component for drives
my original gaming rig reused the floppy
drive and CD burner that I got as
hand-me-downs from my uncle's Pentium
machine this is not an insignificant
part of the reason that front case doors
were so fashionable at the time black
drives were not that common and they
were even more expensive than their
beige counterparts yes friends the
optical drive was as pricey as it was
essential in those days for the hard
drive though I couldn't carry forward an
old one if I wanted better speed and to
have enough storage to install more than
one CD based game at a time so an 80 gig
with an 8 Meg
or a 120 gig with a 2 Meg cache cost
about the same I eventually settled for
the 80 feeling confident but that was
more than I'd need for a long time and
feeling like the extra performance would
be more worthwhile drives sure used to
be more difficult to install by the way
a V pin versus 40 pin IDE cables master
and slave jumpers you kids have it easy
for the rest of the machine I'm using
close approximations of the components
that I had at the time my CRT was not a
flat screen and yes young kids we called
it a flat screen because the piece of
glass in the front was flat rather than
curved we knew it was still big and
heavy and I actually had slightly
different hand-me-down keyboard than
mice before upgrading a year or so later
to a wireless NX duo but the one thing
that is exactly the same here is the
mouse pad being too cheap to buy a real
mouse pad I used a piece of paper to
overcome the tracking issues on my
computer desk and it worked great by the
way you just have to replace it every
once in a while so we interrupt the
scripted portion of this video to bring
you the moment of truth pressing the
power button after of course turning on
the power supply
oh you hear that tip magnetic Drive fan
ah music come on display it's alive
a flaw an XP 1.1 gigahertz that's okay
we can go and change that manually you
can see 32 Meg's of memory shared ah
hard drive not being picked up
I'll diagnose that later maybe that IDE
cable delete sander setup and there we
are let's get some windows XP installed
on this great so then with the system
working the only question remaining was
will it run minecraft and the answer is
surprisingly no after overpaying for
that stupid motherboard it turns out
that the system is not stable enough to
do anything more than install Windows
and look at the desktop not entirely
unexpected but disappointing to be sure
so if you're not familiar with math drop
the concept is pretty simple they've got
this huge community of enthusiasts and I
can't say like computer enthusiasts or
knife enthusiasts or audio enthusiasts
because there's all these different
enthusiasts so maybe basically go hey
there's this like really cool product
that we'd like can you go to the
manufacturer or an authorized reseller
and tell them hey you know we're all
willing to buy it if you could just do a
little something on the price math drop
takes buyers and sellers and does volume
deals so everyone gets a good deal the
manufacturer sells a bunch and the
buyers get a lower price pretty freakin
cool and you can check it out at the
link in the video description but
recently they have branched out a little
bit and they've started working with
manufacturers to do special editions of
their products just for mass drop and
special pricing is of course included as
well so they worked with HiFi man this
time around to bring back the Aichi 300
with a special MD or master op flare so
in their former life solely under hi-fi
man these entry-level headphone
were priced at about 300 US dollars and
the new one is very similar to the old
8300 s but with an updated and more
lightweight structure more neutral sound
signature and an all-black appearance
compared to the silver and black of
older generations the most important
change however that they have made is
reducing the price to a very actually
legitimately low 99 US dollars so all
you got to do to check them out is head
over to the draw dots /l TT - 80 - 350
don't expect you to remember that check
it out at the link in the video
description thanks for watching guys if
this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was an awesome trip down
nostalgia Lane then get subscribed hit
that like button or even consider
supporting us directly by using our
affiliate code to shop at Amazon buying
a cool shirt like this one or with a
direct monthly contribution you can find
the amazon and the t-shirt links up
there by the way now that you're done
doing all that stuff you're probably
wondering gee what should i watch next
so maybe uh maybe a review of like a
super 6 17 inch gaming laptop you can
check that one out there I guarantee you
that it is both more powerful and
smaller and more expensive and that's
three things that it is both of than
