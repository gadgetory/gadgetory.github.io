Lightyear to the rescue this is camera
man's keys so we've got his uh I don't
know what brand that is is that super
super rude right yeah okay he's nodding
a Subaru we've got a Subaru key and then
his Subaru remote evidently Subaru car
today I will be unboxing and the hold on
don't reach for the dislike button just
yet I know you guys hate this but just
deal okay there's a good reason for this
today I will be unboxing the iPad 2 this
is the 16 gig Wi-Fi version so it does
not have 3g okay I'm going to take off
the package just like that and then I'm
gonna open it up I have actually never
used an iPad beyond like you know a
couple minutes here and there
comparing screens against the
transformer for example and having
someone kind of lean over and show me
what they're doing on their iPad 2 and
it looked interesting so here we go you
can feel free to look down at any time
and then they're here now so hold on
okay sorry about that guys we got
interrupted so I have never unboxed an
iPad 2 before so here we are here it is
okay so there's the iPad now it is not
marked in any way as an iPad 2 it's just
called an iPad but it's better and more
faster and more thinner okay oh there we
go okay so it comes apart like that okay
iPad so this is the black version you
can see the screen is quite shiny I
don't know if it'll turn on right off
the hop here might not be charged
yeah it's charged okay alright screen
turns on got your little little apple
logo got your camera for face time
because the iPad 2 does support a
front-facing camera for face time okay
just looking at the back you can see it
has that proprietary Apple connector
there got a speaker got black Apple logo
iPad this is a 16 gig model okay
over here we got some volume adjustment
we got that I believe that locks the
orientation or something like that does
it cameraman might know yeah he knows in
there does okay now there's your power
button headphone jack up here that looks
like a microphone and finally the
rear-facing camera which I actually
really like the rear-facing camera is
pretty pretty decent on the iPad 2 okay
so it wants me to plug in or something
okay we'll worry about that later
okay other packaging here designed by
Apple in California that's key Apple
wants you to know that it's designed by
then in California oh and look at that
we've got a little diagram of what
everything is but I already showed you
all that well that's silent cameraman
you were wrong that doesn't that doesn't
lock the orientation it's silent movie
maybe you can change the functionality
of it I think that was one of the things
they introduced with some version of
something was that you could change what
things did okay we have Apple stickers
okay let's let's go find something
really ironic to put one of these Apple
stickers on okay follow me so I'm just
gonna go into the tech tips room I'm
gonna find something that makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever and I'm
gonna put this Apple sticker on it mmm
gaming motherboard maybe ooh how about a
GTX 590 just for fun just for giggles
here guys so I'm gonna take my GeForce
GTX 590 I'm gonna put that on it yeah
how wrong is that okay yeah I had my fun
let's go back finish our unboxing
so next we will find a power cord the
charger cord both alright there's your
standard one this is the one that
doesn't have the the releases on the
side so it just plugs and plugs and
unplugs right in all right we have a
little wall adapter for the power cord
so this is just an AC 2 5 volt 5 volt
whatever USB power adapter alright just
looks a little something like that tucks
in there so elegant right that comes off
so you can put on a different one if you
so desire but I don't last but not least
we have a piece of plastic yeah okay and
it was glued down so we weren't yet to
take that up okay so why do I have an
iPad 2 I have an iPad 2 so that I can
start doing a little bit more tablet
coverage and for better or for worse
whether you guys like it or not the iPad
2 is the market leader right now so I'm
gonna be doing some more coverage of
Android 3.0 and I wanted to have
something to compare it against so I
picked myself up an iPad now I will be
able to show you guys all the
comparisons that you actually do care
about and all I had to do was obtain
something that you don't care about in
order to do it so I hope you enjoyed my
unboxing and I'm kind of interested to
see what the like to dislike ratio is on
this video because the last time I did
something you get this you guys just
kill me sometimes this thing right here
the mctv's which is actually a pretty
cool little product basically it's a
wireless hdmi and wireless USB hub thing
just because they're box box an awful
lot about how it's mat compatible you
guys rip me to shreds
just for unboxing it but the stupid
thing is PC compatible too so yeah I'll
be interested to see what happens here
