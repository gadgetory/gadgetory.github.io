time we're gonna be checking out
something that I personally am very
excited about this is the Asus Republic
of gamers
g-46 notebook so this is a premium
notebook that comes with their 360 care
package two-year international warranty
meaning you can take it anywhere zero
bright guarantee two-way free standard
shipping in the event of an RMA and 24/7
tech support it looks like this one
doesn't include their accidental damage
which only the very very expensive
notebooks do but that's still a very
strong included warranty compared to the
offerings from other guys on the market
and they soos has been making it a habit
to do that with their notebooks so why
do I care about this notebook you guys
might be asking yourselves well number
one is that I like gaming notebooks I
like powerful notebooks
I don't play as many games as I used to
but what I might find myself doing is
editing video on a notebook or just
generally being a power user and wanting
something that gets closer to the
desktop experience that I can have we've
got a nice protective paper sleeve here
for the notebook itself just gonna tuck
that away and what a gaming notebook
typically does is it delivers a bit of a
thicker overall form factor but it is
able to deliver better overall
experience
a better overall performance and a
better experience for power users so
check this up in terms of the thickness
here's an HTC One phone for size
comparison you can see it's not that
thin but it has powerful cooling and
that's part of the reason it has to be
thicker you can see through these grills
the huge heat sinks that are cooling the
GPU and the CPU because this notebook
does not skimp on the specs it actually
uses a core i5 30 to 30 mm which can
turbo up to 3.2 gigahertz and a gtx 660
m so what you'll notice about this is
that unlike other sort of massive gaming
laptops this one actually fits in my lap
it has the same kind of style and
aesthetic that we've seen from other
asus rog notebooks such as the g 75 so
you can
see we've got an illuminated a Seuss
logo on the back with a shiny Asus logo
so that's sorry an illuminated ROG logo
the overall notebook has a matte finish
so you can see I can touch it like this
and it actually doesn't show any
fingerprints which is great for
something you're gonna carry around with
you which this one is actually possible
to carry around I'd rather have thicker
than bigger in this case the hinge is
extremely robust so you can see it's uh
it's attached here not quite at the very
edge of the notebook but that gives you
a comfortable distance between the
keyboard and the screen itself so let's
just go ahead and give you guys sort of
another angle of that we showed you the
back enough already so on the bottom
you've got easy access to memory
upgrades the hard drive that comes in
this particular one is a 750 gig Drive
with an 8 gig SSD providing a caching
functionality that gives it a boost in
performance without without actually
having to have two separate drives it's
got an SD card reader on this side HDMI
out super speed USB 3 as well as VGA
this is probably the most flexible
display output that I like to see on an
Opel is er this is this is the
flexibility I like to see because
between these two you can adapt to
pretty much anything else that you need
to run however things do get better so
there's your power in there's your given
Ethernet there's two more USB three BAM
mini displayport love to see that so you
can actually drive multiple displays off
of this notebook very very easily
it's got microphone and headphone jacks
that are dedicated some some smaller
thin and late notebooks are starting to
integrate these into one I think I what
is it 3-3 pull jack so the ones that
have both microphone and headphones on
one and now that we've opened it up you
can see it has a very sleek look to it
so the bezel of the monitor part is
matte again which I think looks really
clean really really good there's your
webcam but down here you've got what
appears to be brushed aluminum now you
guys if you've been watching my videos
for a while will know what I think of
brushed aluminum on places where you
have to rest your hands because it will
stain pretty much instantly but what
Asus is actually gone with here for the
material is that brushed plastic that
looks gorgeous it looks just like
brushed aluminum except you can actually
clean it
unlike brushed aluminum so it'll come
clean and it'll always look good
whereas brushed aluminum will look
terrible pretty much immediately on the
keyboard layout itself they haven't
committed any cardinal sins so they've
got long shifts long enter' and long
backspace meaning you'll be able to
easily reach all of those buttons should
you desire it and all of your usual
hotkeys are built into the top here so
brightness up and down for the
illuminated keyboard wireless on and off
that's wireless AC so it has the very
latest wireless standard brightness up
and down for your screen itself as well
as external display options turning the
touchpad off which is an important
option for gamers because the last thing
you want is to be using your keyboard
and then a separate mouse which most
people don't game on a touchpad and then
accidentally brush the touchpad with
your palm and then have that
accidentally move you around inside the
game other than that there's not too
much to say about it it does feature
Nvidia Optimus which is a basically
Nvidia and Intel's way of using their
drivers well I guess Nvidia developed it
more than Intel but invidious way of
using their drivers to turn the
dedicated GPU off when you're not
running a 3d application and then back
on when you are running a 3d application
that way you get the power benefit of
using on the on-board GPU with the
performance benefit of using the 2gig
GTX 660 M GPU for actually playing games
so here in summary this is what it'll
look like when sort of a slightly small
homunculus style person actually holds
the device and it's just ah so much
lighter and more portable than your
typical gaming brick so I was really
excited when I saw this at CES and now
that I have it sort of in my hands in
person I am no less excited about it oh
well maybe a little less excited about
it because I've seen it already but
whatever I didn't get to show it to you
guys in as much detail I didn't actually
show the accessories so it comes with a
power cord comes with a notebook
warranty card which is important make
sure you hold on to that keep that
information because it does have as I
mentioned before a very good warranty
battery notice telling you about the
warranty on your battery drivers on a
disc as well as a user manual there you
go and last but not least presumably is
the power brick so this is a little on
the bigger side because even though asus
has packed all that power
into a small notebook form-factor well
it still needs to actually get the power
somehow so you end up with a bit of a
bigger bigger power brick so again this
is a 4.3 inch phone we should give you
some idea how big that bad boy is don't
forget to subscribe slyness tech tips
from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and i'll see you guys
again next time so there's a couple
things I missed there's some optional
configurations it's available in a
variety of different config so number
one is you can either get it with a 1366
by 768 screen this particular model
comes with a 1600 by 900 screen which is
definitely the one I'd prefer because at
that 14 inch size 1600 by 900 delivers a
compromise between a good gaming
experience because you're not pushing
quite as many pixels as 1,900 by 1080
but also getting that desktop real
estate that you need you can also change
up the storage config so this is a 750
gig drive with an 8 gig SSD however you
can get up to a 1 terabyte drive with at
128 gig SSD using a combination of the
two and a half inch bay and the M SATA
spot that is available and another funny
observation that I made that I didn't
even notice when I was doing the regular
unboxing is that there's no battery I
couldn't find the battery it has a non
removable battery so my thinking for
this because normally a chassis this
thick you'd see a removable battery of
some sort but my thinking is that what
Asus actually had to do in order to fit
this kind of performance and this kind
of heat dissipation in such a small
chassis is they had to go with a non
removable battery that's uh that's built
into the to the device so there you go
now I think we're actually done thanks
for watching this video was edited on a
workstation powered by kingston memory
oh it actually uses a core i5 32
oh crap one more time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
