v box a little while ago this is a
different month so this is the zbox blue
reigns is a copy of cyberlink powerdvd
full version bluray player and this is a
customizable bare-bones mini PC that
features as you may or may not be able
to figure out blu-ray so it's powered by
nvidia ion which means you also have
intel atom going on inside and it has a
blu-ray disc player which I have
mentioned a couple of times already and
why don't we start getting this thing
open because most of the other stuff on
the outside of the box is all stuff that
we can see by opening the box so what do
you need to make a bare-bones mini PC
into a completely new pc well first
you'll need a two and a half inch drive
and i would say hard drive but you don't
necessarily have to use a hard drive you
could use an SSD drive if you wanted a
nice silent blu-ray capable media pc and
you'll also need some sodium memory i'll
find out once we get a little bit
further into this weather that is ddr2
or ddr3 looks like it is ddr2 up to a
maximum of four gates so that would be
two sockets okay and then last but not
least you will need an operating system
such as Windows 7 okay so here we have
instruction or what is this this is a
quick start guide which gives you the
full specifications of the unit so why
don't we have a look at what that is so
you've got an intel atom dual-core
you've got the nm10 express chipset we
talked about memory already next
generation nvidia i/o and GPU so that is
the second gen 1 we had one USB to one
combo e-sata / USB 2 and then we have
two USB 3 ports that's a pretty cool
feature okay we talked about this
Gigabit LAN I Wi-Fi n to channel high
definition audio though you're going to
have support for 7.1 over HDMI at least
I'm assuming you will you better you do
otherwise it wouldn't be a very good
blu-ray player would it ok let's open
this
up a little bit front view Wow since leg
up it's a poster look at this okay so
front view system installation
connecting USB 3 devices connecting
bunch of different devices that gives
you a color guy for installing your
memory module installing a hard disk and
installing a mini pci express card also
i see ok so it doesn't come with Wi-Fi
necessarily it says it is 80 2.11 BGN
compatible and enhanced wireless
security compatible so it looks like you
will need to install a mini PCIe Wi-Fi
card should you desire Wi-Fi alright
next we have this which include some
stuff we had some warranty terms that
you have a one-year warranty in the
Americas there's your cyberlink blu-ray
disc solution and hopefully the serial
number isn't on there anywhere where you
guys are going to like see that okay
there's your support CD which is those
drivers which you should download the
latest from the zotac website here's
your user's manual which also includes a
lot of the stuff that's on that poster
that we found and let's have a look at
the unit itself so the first thing I'll
actually know what we're going to get to
the unit a minute we've got a vesa mount
here I'm not going to bother taking that
out cuz it looks pretty firmly
entrenched in there but it's the same as
the one you have on the normal zbox
level of the things and we have a power
brick she's quite a bit larger than some
of the atom based PC power bricks that
I've seen but I guess part of that is
because we are powering an optical drive
we do have some mounting screws for the
vesa mount as well as a DVI to vga
adapter also in here is quite a bit
heavy or too I mean I guess it doesn't
really matter for a pc versus for like a
netbook then i would actually care how
heavy the power adapter is because you
have to move around the netbook whereas
a pc you don't
yeah it actually come looks like a
notebook doesn't it like from the bottom
I i would i would guess that that's a
notebook and that there would be like a
screen on the other side that slips up
like this anyway let's have a look at
the front it's a very slick looking
little unit I like it you got like a
brushed silver on the top along with a
shiny glossy black here with a glowing
blue ring alright then on the very front
you've got your blu-ray drive which is
included by the way you've got an SD
reader your USB 2.0 port USB 3.0
superspeed port headphones microphone
and a power switch moving along to this
side you've got a little zotac logo
there which is quite classy hopefully
you can see that in the camera moving
along to the back we've got our power in
a Kensington lock because you might want
to lock this baby up you've got optical
audio out hdmi out DVI out so you got
all the options you need remember you
have vga via this one with an adapter if
you want this is a USB 2 / eSATA port
Gigabit LAN and another USB 3.0 port
remember USB 3 points are backwards
compatible so you can easily plug USB
2.0 devices into them so here we can see
we've got easy access via 6 nice large
size screws just standard Phillips head
so you can take that whole thing off and
still you drive install your memory
should use tow desire and surprisingly
that's all they're pretty much is to say
about it so thank you for checking out
my unboxing of you know what I wish I'd
told you guys the products model at some
point the HDI d33 be are so the BRS for
blu-ray and don't forget to subscribe to
