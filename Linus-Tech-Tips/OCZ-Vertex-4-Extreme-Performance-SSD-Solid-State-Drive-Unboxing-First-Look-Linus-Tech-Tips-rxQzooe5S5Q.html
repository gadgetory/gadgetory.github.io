is actually particularly exciting this
is OCC's vertex 4 so if you're familiar
with OCC's nomenclature for their drives
you'll know that as far as the consumer
space goes
vertex is their branding for what they
consider to be their top-tier best they
can deliver top product line so well the
original vertex used an indolent
barefoot controller and that was when
OCZ Minda links were both still separate
companies the second generation vertex
used the first-generation SandForce
controller which at the time delivered
previously unheard of performance due to
the way that it compressed the data
before it wrote it to the flash allowing
you to basically get more more mileage
for your dollar in terms of the actual
speed of the flash itself due to
controller voodoo magic than the vertex
3 which is still a current product and
still going is using a second generation
sound force controller I see the 3 6
gigabit per second Sam force controller
and this right here is the second
product we've seen from OCZ that takes
advantage of their new relationship with
in the links so that is the original
vertex one was in the links and now
we've come full circle again back tuned
in the links but the difference is this
time ocz is the owner of in the links
has developed the controller for this
chip in-house since the acquisition for
Enda links and is so proud of their
creation that they are putting their
vertex branding as well as a five-year
warranty behind this product and I
apologize guys in advance for the for
the backdrop here which happens to be my
system that I'm working on but it was
too heavy to move so it is what it is so
what does OCC have to say for themselves
high performance design yeah that's for
sure as far as real-world performance
benchmarks go it's pretty much up there
it's either a top performer or the top
performer in some synthetic benchmarks
it doesn't do quite as well but at the
end of the day I use my drives
in the real world I don't know about you
mlc flash memory is hardly a selling
point everyone's using mlc flash memory
these days includes an SSD adapter
that's good to have see the three six
gigabit per second and which is pretty
much the limiting factor for the
performance of this drive due to a
couple of the a couple of the
performance enhancements they've made
including a huge Ram cache that allows
it to basically max out the state of
three six gigabit per second interface
whenever that's able to use it trim
support once again it better be and an
really cool thing about the fact that it
has trim support is also compared to the
octane which was the first into links
infused ocz products since the since the
acquisition non trim support is also
significantly better compared to that
first generation Everest product so this
is Everest too in terms of the
controller and it not only supports trim
but also performs much better without
trim into links in fuse so that means it
has an indolent controller as opposed to
the SandForce controllers that not only
OCC has access to but everyone else and
their dog has access to this is their
own things so was designed and built
with unparalleled performance
reliability and endurance in mind so
reliability and endurance is something
that they're very very serious about on
this product not only are they throwing
the five-year warranty on it but they're
also building in a lot more advanced
features such as and I totally have
notes over there no don't look over
there those are my notes okay just a
second so the features that OCC is
building into justify that warranty are
things like very low write amplification
compared to previous generation products
which means that when especially when
the drive is in a more used state and it
has to move things around before it can
write to it it is doing less wasting of
the I mean let's face it few limited
write cycles that are available on the
NAND flash that it's using so that's
going to make it last longer also it's
ready for upcoming generations of NAND
flash because it supports much more
robust error correction than previous
generation products which allows it to
as we shrink the processes for the NAND
the NAND flash that's on these drives
they become inherently less accurate and
less reliable so
we'll be able to compensate for that
with an advanced controller like this
one which may not seem relevant today
but if you're an engineer at OCC or any
other SSD company you had better be
concerned about that especially if
you're going to bring a product to
market and expect it to last for a long
time now speaking of lasting for a long
time performance is very good today but
I would definitely expect it to continue
to improve because we are still very
early on in the firmware of this drive
and even the last generation Everest
product octane got a significant
performance boost with firmware well
after the initial launch so inside the
box we get a my SSD is faster than your
hard drive sticker we get an OCZ
warranty and installation guide book
suite alright we get a two and a half
inch to three and a half inch OC z
adapter made of metal which is good and
we get some mounting screws and finally
the vertex for 2.5 inch solid-state
drive and what could be what could be
sexier than putting it next to this GTX
590 classified so you can enjoy both of
them together pretty sweet hey so
consistent performance across all
workloads is a as a trait that both
Everest controllers share now what that
means is compared to San forswear if
you're copying a large file that happens
to be like a rar file or a 7-zip file an
already compressed file it will tend to
be significantly slower because San
Forest derives a lot of its performance
by compressing data on the fly and you
can't really compress much further data
that's already been compressed whereas
Everest gets the same performance
regardless of whether you're working
with compressible or non compressible
data
it supports aes-256 encryption which is
a feature that is useful if you encrypt
your drive personally I don't work with
encryption on my desktop so I'm not too
worried about it
it also has absolutely wicked 4k random
read and write performance as well as
outstanding write performance once again
especially with incompressible data when
it comes to incompressible data this
drive is pretty much untouchable the
higher cap drives as with many other
drives I don't know if you guys
checked out this video on my NCIX comm
channel but if you do I do mention this
many times higher capacity drives tend
to perform better than lower capacity
versions using the same architecture
whether it's because there are more
channels to write to in parallel or read
from in parallel giving it just a sheer
bandwidth advantage or whether there are
other architecture tweaks that just
tends to be the case so this is a 256
gig drive which will perform slightly
less than the 512 gig drive and slightly
better than the 128 gig drive so you do
get more value for buying a higher
capacity besides just the additional
capacity and right now this 120 gig is
sort of the sweet spot but more and more
people are deciding to go with 256 gig
drives as well so you can come in and
have a close look at it physically
although I don't expect you're going to
notice much of note the stickers on
crooked on this one so maybe that's
because it's a media sample but you know
that's probably the kind of thing that I
would correct because I mostly do like
that in terms of mounting holes you see
your usual mounting holes so yes it can
be mounted either in a desktop or in a
notebook got your 4 on the bottom you
got your sticker showing the serial
number you got your warranty void if
removed ocz sticker you've got your
standard say 2 3 6 gigabit per second
data port as well as your SATA power
connector and other than that in terms
of the physicality of it yeah there's
nothing special but it's what's under
the hood that makes this dri special
maybe it's not the same kind of a
generational performance leap like we
saw from vertex 1 to vertex 2 or from 2
to 3 but what this is is it's finally
something that ocz has 100% control over
I mean yeah there were the blue-screen
issues with the early earlier SandForce
drives that ocz took the brunt of the
flack for because they were the ones
shipping most of the drives well now
they're no longer relying on a third
party company in order to support them
so this is one of the first products
where we see how well they are going to
deliver when they actually fully control
all aspects of the execution of this
drive so I'm very excited to see how the
pop general public accepts this
particular product thank you for
