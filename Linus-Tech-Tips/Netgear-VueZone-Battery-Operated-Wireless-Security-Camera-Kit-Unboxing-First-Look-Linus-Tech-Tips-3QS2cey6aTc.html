the Netgear view zone okay so I don't
know what the difference between
Wireless and wire free is but there are
no wires I think that is the point
they're trying to make wire free video
monitoring system place it anywhere view
it anywhere includes this others there's
a variety of different kits but this
particular one includes two motion
cameras one base station one outdoor
shell and mount for wall mounts and the
batteries that you need to have them run
at an estimated sort of five minutes per
day depending on when they turn on from
motion sensing for up to six months at a
time place anywhere view any time okay I
think we covered all of this already hi
here we go wire free motion detection
email alerts indoor use and outdoor use
are all supported let's go ahead and
flip over to the side they give you some
examples of where you could mount it
like to a tree or to a wall or two with
our innovative wire free cameras you'll
avoid the hassle of running ugly power
cords you'll spend more time deciding
where to put your cameras than you will
setting them up so there's a chick with
a phone and she's presumably like
something good to do with monitoring
security so she can see her property her
family and her pets hmm that's a white
girl I mean I'm not trying to you know
be like that about it or anything but I
don't think that's her kids they could
be adopted okay so moving right along
we've got a few different options
software wise you can use the free
option which gives you you know the
camel you bought the camera so obviously
of those motion detection with email
alerts you can take a snapshot so no
video okay for ninety-five a month to
get video next we've got live video on
your computer no big deal camera
supported two five and fifteen from the
free to premiere to elite options the
base station does support fifteen
cameras so the hardware is already there
to support the elite option location
supported one one and three so you could
monitor multiple different locations
digital pad and zoom you're going to
have to pay for that live video on your
iPad iPhone or Android got to pay for
that and look at that you can securely
record video to the cloud with the
premiere and the elite service option
it's compatible with both iOS and
Android so that's a good thing
and we've also got some specifications
down here as well so check this out
video resolution is 640 by 480 at 3 FPS
okay QV g so 320 by 240 at 7 FPS so
we're not talking about you know taking
beautiful HD photos we're talking about
like functional security motion sensing
and you know that kind of good stuff
physical specifications ok let's open
this paper baby up and have a look to
what we got going on in here so first
thing we see is a quick install guide
followed by another quick install guide
to quick install guides because one
quick install guide is not good enough
forget gears customers no no they will
provide multiple quick install that's
for the outdoor mount and this is just
sort of in general what to do on sort of
one page or less there you go what do
they say connect your views own system
to the Internet ok install camera
batteries sync bed sync cameras to the
base station okay there you go hold
within 12 inches and something-something
install cameras register your views own
system and get the fuse on mobile app
that's it
okay we got a general public license
sure whatever ok got a day got some
environmentally friendly paper packaging
very nice love to see that alright you
got some power adapters here so you can
run these up the walls to the camera now
I'm just messing with you you don't have
to do that you just plug this into the
base station which wirelessly
communicates with up to 15 cameras so
you plug that guy into your router and I
have no idea what that does guess we'll
find out
hold on there we go power connector ok
it's not labeled either we'll be back in
a moment
so we didn't figure it out but there's a
highly amusing Amazon review of this
thing that basically it's a good review
overall of the unit but it says that the
you manual and website make no mention
they couldn't figure it out either so
there you go aha reset button
there's your sync button up there as
well as your power internet views on
status indicators and that's it that's
the base station it just basically looks
like that plugs into the wall nothing
that complicated here we have some
of the forget what this battery
standards called CRA something or other
it's a three volt battery so presumably
there are two cells inside there and
these are for the cameras themselves
they're really cheap you can buy them in
bulk on dealextreme I have a laser
pointer that takes these batteries so I
have tons of them at home already anyway
wall mounts so these are your drywall
screws if you wanted to wall mount to
drywall
these are little base station little
doodads so you just kind of this must
come off here somehow Oh
adhesive surface there you go so you
just pull that off
caution adhesive may damage surface or
paint so be careful may be tested in a
discreet location or what I sometimes do
if I'm going to stick it to something
that I don't want to damage is I'll just
kind of go like this on my shirt a
little bit first make it sticky enough
to work but not sticky enough to take
the paint right off the wall when you're
done so those are little mounting
doodads and they're magnetized see that
so you just kind of put this wherever
you want then you put this guy on here
and you can position it wherever you
want so those are those are the cameras
they're not wide-angle lenses so you do
want to get them nice and up high maybe
in a corner if you want to capture an
entire room okay there you go
got a little rubber things here so you
can not lose your grip on them when
you're putting them up presumably that's
why okay there's your motion sensor
right there there's your lens right
there and there is your battery
compartment right presumably yeah there
all right throw a couple batteries in
there no big deal I like that they're
nice and light and compact I mean yeah
it's only three FPS or you know whatever
other complaints you might have but at
least it's small and compact and you can
easily scale it and add more more
cameras to it should you should you want
to all that that opens it up okay I
didn't realize that before so then you
can power it on okay just like that all
right what else we got in here you throw
net cable for plugging in the base
station aha
outdoor man very cool so this guy right
here is I guess what the screws are four
different screws for that so you can
screw it into a tree or the side of your
house or whatever else you want has a
mount right here that is actually
capable of rotating as much as you or as
little as you want you just use this guy
right here to lock it in place there you
go now it won't turn very easily anymore
we go ahead and tighten this guy as well
so there you go point it wherever you
want you just open it up with two screws
here and here
throw the unit inside and it should be
weatherproof they operate up to I think
minus fourteen degrees so for those of
you who live in Toronto ah-hah sorry it
never goes under minus four gene here um
yeah it's probably fine especially if
you keep it close enough to your house
that is getting some incidental heat off
of there and I mean besides the
battery's wearing out faster I can't
imagine there's anything in here that
particularly damaged by the cold weather
but feel free to let me know if I'm
wrong includes a screwdriver actually
for for this so includes pretty much
everything you need right out of the box
there you go that's everything so you
got you two cameras and you can buy more
you got all your mounting screws you've
got I mean this is cool so it includes
extras of these so you could potentially
move them around if you want you can
have these permanently fixed in places
that are convenient and you can attach
one of them outdoors should you desire
to do so thank you for checking out my
