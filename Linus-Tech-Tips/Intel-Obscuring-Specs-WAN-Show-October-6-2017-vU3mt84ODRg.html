been a very challenging three weeks so I
was talking to talking to a couple of
people about it today because it was
such an astonishing realization for me
that I just had to share it with
everybody in the last three weeks I have
spent only six out of 15 days working on
our like daily content Wow five days I
was out protect show down yeah three
days I've been basically out for our og
rig reboot yeah and then one day I was
out for ultra-wide festival so you throw
in a fuel and I have actually had almost
no time to work on like our normal
content so on the one hand it's great
that we're like getting any of it done
so that's cool but on the other hand
like I haven't actually gotten to goof
around with tech in so long like I okay
the kinds of projects that I have on the
go right now okay I have a thread Ripper
IHS transplant to do so I want to put
the vanity Linus tech tips one on a
working chip okay so yeah it's nice if I
can never do it I want to break out the
old chiller oh I put you thing like
these are things you're progressive and
goes no I'm making no progress
I want to go sub-zero I want to do the
final office update for the for the
window TV okay yeah um I you know what I
should I should bring up Trello I should
have a look at all the other like crazy
stuff that I'm supposed to be doing
right yeah I don't get to play with that
kind of technology anymore but like you
need to change your handle man but
Xiaomi me mix too yeah I gotta get my
review down to that like look look at
the screen on this thing it's upside
down
well yeah Wow but look at the whole
thing whole thing's a screen yeah
basically yeah and that's cool it's not
square and software is terrible
it's not first terrible software needs
some work I don't
that kind of tech but boiler I'm not
gonna say your whole handle he need to
figure out someone else dude has been
like contributing to the sales open
source which is super cool and some cool
things have happened this week we had
that meeting thing which I'm sure didn't
help at all with your being able to work
on me yeah content stuff but floatplane
floatplane progress right yeah yeah ah
hopefully dude if you're out there take
the job come work with us yeah that
would be great we we need we need
skilled developers yeah yeah other cool
top most insane SSD setup so six 960
pros running in raid zero nice on thread
Ripper nice like actually that one
progress is being made cuz Ivan's
working on it but anyway the point is I
think the most insane is is to sit up is
actually when that guy tied together
like 50 of them like six years ago so
I'm just saying I'm just saying like you
might have used newer technology but
like you said SSD setup in general so
like you're just saying anyways for news
this week we have a bunch of different
stuff one NCIX tech tips is like gone
it's in limbo that's for sure for now
mmm-hmm maybe coming back google
announces the pixel to and pixel to
excel and Intel is renaming their KB
Lake Pentiums
it's super dumb it's like the dumbest
thing ever
yeah and oh right we'll roll the intro
now booth
it's interesting because we have a few
pieces of Intel news in here which has
not been super common for a while has
all been AMD news but it's like not good
stuff um you know I actually probably
wanted to talk about that because yeah
actually know what yeah I do have some I
do have some stuff to say about that are
you gonna talk about this by the way
yeah I will okay oh yeah yeah sorry max
I'll do that for you I totally forgot I
remoted into my computer and then I just
didn't do it
nope my computer uses a real password
yeah unlike everything else um sorry
guys hold on a second okay I just saved
a v3 and you're good okay
all right so you know what why don't we
why don't we tackle let's do the dumb
intel news first and then let's do the
dumber cool dumb reaction to intel news
because like honestly I was pretty I was
pretty frustrated with the community's
reaction to certain aspects of coffee
lake and the launch and our review of it
okay be kind of haven't looked into this
it was it was pretty dumb so num lock 21
post it on the forum the original
article here is from tech power up and
you rats
hold on Intel to rebrand Pentium as
Pentium gold oh oh yes ah yeah wait why
okay so it's all part of like an
overarching stupid thing hold on I'm
just gonna turn
apertures what I'm so confused is this
only for the hot oh sorry one second
guys this is kind of silly so low power
low power Gemini Lake s OCS will bear
the Pentium silver brand
besides seller own is their Pentium
bronze I don't see a Pentium bronze
so there's Pentium silver and Pentium
gold so basically as far as I can tell
Intel hired some kind of new like senior
VP of branding or marketing or like a
product naming or whatever that position
is where you actually make the decision
about what to call the product and they
did the unthinkable they managed to make
Intel's naming scheme worse it's
impressive
you know like to give them props yeah
they found a way because I had the will
they had Intel or determine Intel hasn't
named for a consumer okay like I'm not
talking about you know Xeon or Itanium
little tree Itanium sounds pretty cool
what's gold Trillo said it's a codename
Intel's code names are so good yeah a
lot of the time sometimes they're done
skull trail although I was so
componentry oh my god I mean even stuff
like Alpine Ridge yeah like that's
pretty cool be like yeah I want like an
Intel Alpine Ridge hell yeah that's a
Thunderbolt controller by the way it
into him I mean even Thunderbolt has a
cool name but on the CPU side okay so
back go way back in the day it was like
the 286 and the 386 and 486 and all that
made sense I know their numbers but
people remember you got your generation
and you got your your instruction set
okay max ad City Street right cool then
they got to five and they were like no
let's not do 586 let's go Pentium and
you know what not bad maybe part of it
is that Pentium has basically existed
since I've like had a computer well no
actually that's not true we had a 386
that we then upgraded to a 40
stand that change though you're going
something wrong slightly less Ultra
Hardcore yeah you're going your your and
then you and then you go generations of
pentium okay and then Celeron I was like
that's true okay
tell her why not then came core what if
it was actually how many cores they had
then sure yeah so if a core to was a
dual core yeah but yeah but then you're
like you're backed into a corner cuz
what are you gonna call that what are
you gonna call the next generation you
would have to call it the core to to do
remember core 2 quad though yes core to
do low core 2 quad so you would have to
say I mean you still have to do it you
don't have to say yeah I've got an Intel
Core 2 Duo dual core CPU bad no and then
you got these indecipherable numbers at
the end of them and in Intel's defense
there is a legend on their site for how
to decipher those yeah but you know many
of the numbers like never ended up
getting incremented at all so they might
as well just not had them and Intel
plans out their product roadmap so far
in advance like do they really need to
leave you know like a 50 there just in
case they need to use it like they never
do it so anyway anyway so we've been
stuck with core core i3 Core i5 core i7
for a long time and then at least core
i9 made sense in the sense that it was a
continuation of something that's been
established over the last 10 years if
you want to show off how ridiculous this
is just show our Intel naming videos on
tech wiki yeah I think it's got like 6
million views like what is uh what is
core i7 videos
yeah hold on here we'll bring this up
seven million like it keeps on trucking
this one
where's at core i3 Core i5 and core i7
as fast as possible seven million
frickin views alright what is the core I
nine that's got a million since three
months ago like people like clearly
understand it a little better now than
they used to but at least core I nine
had the advantage of continuity and I
photos people are shopping for it as
much expensive and the other issue too
though is that they did kind of screw it
up because if core I nine had simply
been high-end desktop yeah then sure but
they've got core i7s and core i5s
on the same platform and Oh men seventy
seven forty K or X is it an axe I can't
even remember but whatever the like the
KB Lake chips on X $2.99 they were super
done when X 299 launched now they are
like super super mega ultra dumb because
now that coffee lake has launched 77 40
X you would only be buying one of those
if you were just a complete idiot or you
were a professional overclocker looking
for like perk or records or something
cuz coffee lake is overclocking pretty
well five gigahertz it looks pretty
attainable and not just for like people
who are sorting through trays of CPUs so
that's pretty cool anyway coming back to
Pentium so they brought back the Pentium
brand after having gotten rid of it for
many years and they assigned it to their
cheapo products and now it's kind of
like like that feels a little bit like
kind of sad yeah it's like reusing what
used to be like top-of-the-line like
cream of the cream and like going for
like a nostalgia sale to someone who you
like I guess in the sense it's like it's
if it's competitive with Intel's like
old CPUs like you'd have to be running
something old enough to be a Pentium for
it to be an upgrade right maybe that was
the rationale I don't know like at least
they didn't
at least they didn't pull an AMD where
they brought back the FX branding Oh
for like a super super pain stream
product because remember guys or maybe
not remember like imma let you know
young people FX used to be $1000 yeah
period you didn't buy an FX for less
than $1000 that was it it was let's
cream to the cream and then they brought
back FX as like super ultra mega
rebranded stuff we had that's cool so it
might sell some stuff yeah exactly so
anyway um back to gold as far as I can
tell
Intel brought in some kind of rebranding
executive who renamed all these eons
according to this bronze silver gold
platinum naming scheme and it makes no
sense at all I'd love to see internal
numbers to see if anything changed when
they did that no of course not
oh I know but I would like to be able to
represent my argument with facts and
it's so confusing because again Intel's
server products the product names were a
little confusing like something did like
I like a 2687 W but like you need such
specific things yeah it doesn't really
matter if it's confusing you're gonna
work them all anyway and if you know
what a W is a W is like a high power
workstation ship then you'd know it's
not gonna have the same like max core
account as the ones that are designed
for like tons of virtualization or
whatever else and it's gonna have like
higher boost clocks is probably got a
higher TDP like you could kind of piece
it together if you were somewhat
familiar with the lineup now like a gold
could be a high-performance view that
fits in this socket or that one or like
this dual platform one it has to do with
like the raw performance but the
features get left behind and so now
we're just we're just like gonna just
tack gold onto stuff
like I just it's just frustrating so the
name change comes with a refreshed case
badge and a slightly modified box design
and it'll be effective November 2nd 2017
so basically gold which is I don't want
to say always tacky but it's pretty much
always tagged usually tacky unless it's
a rank in a competitive video game it's
tacky well now hold on golden black can
look pretty good I mean as like a
product naming thing oh oh yeah that
know that like how dead is that like
don't the last time anyone did like
bronze silver gold you can use gold
peacefully it just has to be used
properly like remember when we were
doing the support tiers on the forum
which incidentally our bronze silver and
gold we were talking about it and I was
just like you know what I just don't
have time to think about this let's just
do bronze silver and gold but like but
what's your Excuse I think ours is also
pretty easy
there isn't any confusing like it
doesn't actually follow the features it
only follows brought performs like no
there's really not much else you get
yeah you get a different colored badge
and get access to a better forum thank
you for your contribution that's
ultimately what it is so it's not a
better forum everything happens in the
bronze forum
spoiler alert yes there's a counting to
ten thousand thread in the bronze forum
and the silver and gold forums are
pretty much cobwebs hey do you guys want
to do you guys want to get some really
cool insight into the way that YouTube
does or doesn't deliver video
notifications to subscribers this is
pretty cool so hold on I'm actually
gonna load up another another tab here
to give you guys some context for this
it was pretty cool and I have some I
have some good Intel news in a moment
here but here let's go ahead let's bring
up some analytics for this bad boy
surprisingly a lot of people said no
about what people wanting to see this
really there was definitely quite a few
people who said yes as well but well
whatever it's cool you'll like it
controls so here's the dashboard for one
of our recent releases so you can have a
look at what
a video might typically do in the first
hour so this is our core i7 8700 K
review sitting at 690 thousand videos
and in the first hour it did about
eighty four thousand followed by seventy
two thousand this is a weird launch time
so this BK curve looks a little bit
different than it normally would but
it's also not totally atypical yeah
alright so in the last 60 minutes whoa
there goes a fly it did about thirty
four hundred views oh you guys can't see
that whatever it's now you take my word
for it thirty four hundred views or so
okay so YouTube's algorithm is so I
don't use the word smart are you
but what I'll say is it is so aggressive
about targeting content that it it
thinks might be me trying to use my
subscriber base as a way to communicate
with the people that watch Linus tech
tips it's so sensitive to that that
check this out the when show and stream
announcement video I specifically
uploaded at the same time every week
with the same title every week and
YouTube's algorithm has got this thing
crushed to the point where in the first
hour it is probably gonna do like let's
see we're only doing about a hundred and
a seventh of an hour I think yeah
something along those lines it has only
managed to do about thirty six hundred
views in the last twenty minutes or so
pretty crazy that's nuts so you see okay
this is an extreme example and this is
something where you know what quite
honestly I could name it something else
and that would help more people get
notifications for it but intentionally
I'm feeding into the algorithm here
allowing the algorithm to take the
people who aren't interested in wine
show and just not pump in the
notification like I'm okay with that
because we just do it because we've
always done it and if it boosts the live
viewers a little bit then like great
they know we're live that's cool
so the
that do rely on that notification if we
don't put it up some people do miss
Lamont show but what this is a fair
amount of this to be clear I'm glad max
won and the chat said I see the YouTube
video I ignore it and I hit the twitch
bookmark so that might be part of why it
gets buried either way either but but
that's one of the reasons that we we
continue to do it just in case people
are lying on it yeah but this is an
extreme example of the way that YouTube
does manipulate the way that it the way
that it propagates new video information
to someone who is subscribed and it's
it's one of those things that's
frustrating it's one of the reasons that
we're we're starting floatplane and I
was just kind of inspired to talk about
it for some reason I don't remember why
anymore but we can we can move on to our
next topic um alright so I was a little
I was actually a little disappointed in
our in our viewers reaction to the
coffee like video like there was an
astonishing amount of ignorance in some
of the comments with respect to how how
we would have manipulated what
benchmarks we used like and like the
problem is that the arguments just don't
even make any sense like someone was
upset that we didn't include the Verizon
7 1800 X as though we were trying to
conceal AMD's superiority and we didn't
want AMD to seem like a better value the
1800 X is not a very good value the best
value Rison 7 is the 1700 there's 1800 X
is what like 200 megahertz higher than
the 1700 X what why how would that hurt
AMD's value prop to throw in a processor
that costs $100 morons clock 200
megahertz higher how are we hurting
AMD's appearance of value by choosing
one of their chips that is a better
value now one thing that we didn't
discuss in our video and honestly the
funny thing is this like barely even
came up people are so fixated on
you know comparisons that they don't
like or and/or don't understand or
whatever else that they didn't even
notice this one what we should have
discussed was some of the differences in
platform cost like the fact that I don't
350 board is cheaper than a Z 370 board
but just a number of people that are
like when we release a video that's
positive about Intel they're like wow
you guys sure changed your tune so fast
about being sponsored by them no we
changed our tune because they released a
different product that's different than
the one we said we didn't like it's it's
called it's called looking at what's in
front of you and evaluating it instead
of just going in having already decided
the answer yeah yeah is it like is it as
bad as the oh my god they didn't
benchmark with Wow why can't today in
the neighborhood I know right now the
future of OpenGL Vulcan yeah hard to say
hard to say but anyway apparently we're
doing damage control over Intel forcing
customers to buy a new motherboard on
the same socket I wonder how much Intel
paid him for this nothing nice so the
way that that remote is in common and
unfortunately I can't get anyone to go
on the record about it so I can't say
who my source is but what happened was
Intel designed their platform for two
generations of CPUs the same way they
have for the last 10 years that's how it
went that's how it goes down you cannot
like it and that's totally cool and I
totally get it but they designed it for
two generations they did not design it
for a 6 core processor and there were
physical things that were redesigned
good Intel have made it work
off the record I've got indications that
they might have been able to
in fact probably could have but would it
have been a janky solution that might
not have had the reliability that
Intel's known for in all likelihood yes
so was this partially a marketing
decision possibly personally I'm pretty
annoyed that is e3 70 for example cannot
hold a skylake or a KB Lake chip but I
totally understand why Intel wouldn't
want to put their stellar reputation for
a reliability on the line
by allowing you to put a new coffee leg
chip in your Zee 270 board without
having fully validated it and here's
another thing you guys have to
understand just because Intel has a spec
and just because like it should work
doesn't mean that every motherboard
manufacturer out there built properly to
the spec it doesn't mean that every SKU
will work and when you're someone like
Intel if you say it's gonna work it is
supposed to work
yeah like building to spec a lot of the
times you make product differentiation
by finding ways to not build the spec
you end up making a lot more people mad
by trying to accommodate them sometimes
than you do by just going don't forget
it
it doesn't work because something that
you guys are probably missing here you
look at the motivation you go well it's
probably money-grubbing so let's look at
something like until octane which they
opted which they opted to support on
only z2 70 was it if I recall correctly
obtained roses have been unwinnable
yeah I'm sorry Oh blah blah blah blah
blah opt-in commit I'm looking to
upgrade FPS ma'am essentially number two
I want to know if not I lost my pun
tolerance okay I think it I think it is
I think it is only 200 series hold on
there's a there's a thing on puget
obtained yeah okay cool so it's only
supported on z2 70 so the reason for the
it's just an MDOT to stick that's all it
is it's an SSD using the MDOT two
standard so feasibly Intel could have
supported it on z170 and a lot of people
might look at this and go well their
motivation must be money grubbing they
just want me to run out and buy a new
motherboard do you really think anyone
at Intel is stupid enough to think that
anybody's gonna go buy a new motherboard
for obtain if you had enough money to
buy a new motherboard you would buy a
bhoot SSD by dedicated SSD octane is a
value solution it's not money-grubbing
if they were money-grubbing they would
shoehorn in the support not validate it
fully and just let people buy it and if
it works it works and if it doesn't it
doesn't
Ubisoft because the reason that they
decided not to support it on z170 and
this is I'm not going to quote my sort
source this was kind of off the record
I'm actually not even sure if I should
be talking about it was that depending
on the implementation a cretin you gotta
remember this isn't just like
enthusiasts you know gaming boards or
whatever this is across the lake Dells
and acer's and Lenovo's of the world the
implementation on z170 of MDOT - might
not have been up to snuff and they can't
rely on these guys to roll out UEFI BIOS
updates to build in the support because
that would be required so it would end
up being a very confusing message if
they wanted to sell more units they
would want a wider install base of
supported products da don't you think so
anyway
I'm not necessarily happy about
everything they did here but you also
have to understand that it's not always
as simple as like they're bad people
and they just want your money they do
just want your money they're a business
but also understand so does AMD so does
NVIDIA none of them are your friends
right that was gonna bring us really
well into the hole off spec thing why
are people getting different coffee lake
performance results so this was inspired
by a tweet from Jays two cents and was
originally posted on the forum by oh
dang it there's no there's no who posted
you on the forum think James was
originally posted on the forum by oh man
oh oh this was just a discussion in our
own thread okay well fine fine James
but here's Jays here's Jays tweet yeah I
showed that in twitch chat too cool
so you can see that our number and Jays
number are pretty close yeah but then
Paul's is a chunk down and then Kyle's
is even further down for that and
there's a lot of differentiation this is
a significant difference though yeah
with us and Jay sitting around the 1,550
range and Paul and Kyle being in for in
the 1400s and 1200 s so one of the
theories and this was I all's chip
compared to Jays chip is almost a 300
point difference yeah and that is it
that is a difference in Cinebench that's
like you know one of your cores isn't
working level of difference in Cinebench
so I can't I can't believe he goes by
gaben junior on the forum but anyway
Anthony from our team I was talking
about how gamers Nexus had found that
their gigabyte board was giving them
less voltage than specified and he was
wondering if maybe a Seuss did the same
thing in the opposite direction to give
us better results so it seems like
there's a known issue that has to do
with the board's not being fully tuned
for coffee lake yet where the voltage is
being applied might be affecting
performance so we actually have a review
coming on the msi vortex g25 where our
original script that i reviewed with
alex a couple of days ago had this
comment on how when we stress tested it
it would run at four point whatever
gigahertz turbo for like I don't know
three seconds and then it drops like 3.2
whoa so we got a new bios fixed so it
looks like this launch might have been a
little rushed now unfortunately we
weren't able to comment on that in our
coffee lake review because as a general
rule we have made a habit of using only
one particular brand of motherboard for
our launch reviews because we have found
that it means we're less likely to end
up with a 1,200 points in avenged score
when we were supposed to have 1550 Wow
interesting it's like that's paid off
for us so far
but anyway Anthony also said that one of
his hunches is vrm throttling thanks to
the lower specified voltages and that
could be affecting their CPU scores and
it seems like that would make perfect
sense for something like that what
happened with that with that pre-built
machine yep anyway to be clear it's not
like I'm crapping on MSI or gigabyte or
as rock or a Seuss even it's not like
they don't make mistakes they do they
all do but what it looks like might have
happened with this launch is that it got
it might have been kind of rushed if
you're not making mistakes you're not
trying hard enough yeah you're not go
you're not going fast and frantically
and out yeah by faster so anyway it
looks like that has a fair bit to do
with with people's coffee like results
being kind of all over the place like
even even some of ours were like we have
some gaming results for our coffee lake
in spite of its faster clock speed and
nearly identical architecture and more
cache is getting beat by the 7700 K in
gaming and people look this is
impossible these numbers are fake news
it's like ok first of all you guys can't
even decide what agenda I'm fighting for
I was on Intel aside I sure as heck
wouldn't be talking about how the new
chip doesn't perform as long you're fast
and loose just yeah whoever can hand
over the cheque fast yeah like boom from
minute to minute yeah yeah you know what
when the Mitch brought a when the
meteorite I could be changing sides like
that if your CPU box doesn't have a few
hundreds in it you ain't getting a good
review that's right figure it out um
actually please don't do that so any
it looks like it looks like that could
be to do with something like a windows
scheduling issue which was one of the
things that affected rise in seven
performance back when it launched I mean
am I saying that it's for sure that no
but twelve threads is more to handle
than eight and we already know from the
past that hyper threading can affect
gaming performance negatively so that
might be one of the reasons that and we
didn't get an eighty 600k I almost want
to do a separate review of it because
they are kneecapping the i-5 like more
every generation yeah the eighty six
hundred K is a significantly slower chip
unless you overclock it used to be what
everyone purchased yeah
and Intel has gradually tried to move
people the i7 they've tried to brand the
i7 better and apparently that's not
enough so they are well I bet you that's
a part of the existence of i9 it's
trying to be like i7 isn't the most
expensive one that's an interesting
thought well actually I've never thought
about this before either but when you go
to the store at the shampoo bottle
example you know they're like this is a
way too expensive one this is the way to
cheap one I'm gonna buy the one in the
middle or if you take four of them I'm
gonna buy the third one because it's
like more value than really expensive
one but I'm still getting a nice premium
thing maybe that's some of the thought
process there alright so oh you know why
the way people in the chat still doing
the yes and no meme that's impressive I
know we haven't even done it we should
do a shirt yeah but now it's gonna be
too late I know it'll be like a month or
two until we have this shirt it's our
own dead meme yeah I said we should do a
shirt like the day that things started
dead memes yes and then we didn't um
speaking of dead means that's not really
a dead mean fresh box yeah fresh books

team let's see who's even on here - Luke
yeah we got to get to gonna get you
removed Wow
hey I don't know I don't make the rules
I'm like the roll man that's gonna be
really weird hello Tyler max Anthony
Alex James Ivan's not on here um is Jake
on here even oh yeah Jake's on here
Jake's on here
I'm sure there's someone else were
missing it's like sort of an old member
now I know right he was before pella
yeah he once rode from Victoria to San
Francisco I I didn't even I didn't even
know that hello caller
yeah yeah like dude I also didn't know
he had never used a Windows computer
before he started working here I wish he
wasn't physically broken because I'd
like to go swimming with him holy crap
but he's physically broken right now oh
he'll fix it how's he broken right now
just like shoulder and knee issues Oh
bummer probably from doing stuff like
biking from Victoria to San Francisco
right yeah okay in like a really short
period of time I don't know what it is
but like he got there really fast and
then went back like it's it's actually
kind of amazing dude super cool
all right so synergy allows you to solve
the problem having two keyboards and two
mice if this allows you to solve lots of
problems even like being able to throw
your laptop on your desk and being able
to just like use your desktop for
referrals and like do stuff on your
laptop just and so I have set up for a
while where I was using my laptop a lot
more than I am now yeah and I've got an
arm that was actually just a monitor arm
and then you get a plate on it that's a
laptop cool yeah and then you over
torque the tension and all that kind of
stuff whatever it's fine and then you
put the laptop on there so I could go
away and use a laptop bring it home put
it on the arm and then just mouse and
keyboard on
whole set up including the laptop which
is super nice because you can drag and
drop files with it you can even move
stuff over really easily you can set up
LAN transfers
yeah bought keys to move your mouse and
keyboard over it's it's wonderful so it
works across platform so it's Linux Mac
and Windows and they offer a basic and
pro option with one-time payment so head
over to the link in the video
description and or right there seamless
comms laughs energy slash that says
Linus 31 but I think the one I'm
supposed to give you today is Linus 32
and save 50% on synergy today a huge
it's a big discount someone in here said
dual PC streaming works great
yeah this would be pretty helpful for it
yeah actually that's an interesting
fight yeah yeah that's a good that's a
good idea one of the examples I always
use is what was it right like coders
yeah we have like a development machine
and then you also have like a gaming box
next to it or whatever else yeah all
right we got some more topics for you
guys now so Logitech was upset that I
called the key cap markings stickers in
the what was it the GE hold on G
whatever I I can't keep track of
Logitech's naming scheme it was their
Wireless mechanical keyboard though g6
something
it was g6 I mean I don't like their
naming schemes Logitech G 613 okay I
can't tell from the mouse yeah I can't
yeah I don't like it so I don't know I
want to say I like I know it's not as
cool because G for gaming whatever but I
would like it if it was like H
headphones M Mouse okay keyboard right
so basically Corsair I guess so maybe
that's why they can't do it wait this
course start this course tire even still
do that yeah look this is an M 65 or
whatever yeah is it and they have like
their HS which is headset like HS one
hundreds if you go back Corsair started
moving away from it though they've gone
with like void Pro yeah
like what the
heck is that I know what it is I know
what it is but like if I was a consumer
who wasn't super into this stuff what is
it anyway so they were upset and I told
them I would address it on the LAN show
cuz we called them stickers and this
okay so the key caps are textured ABS
plastic that are printed and treated
with a UV coating this is a standard
process they are not stickers what we
were complaining about was that dual
shot would be better and because it's a
lot more durable and quite frankly it
can be UV coated all you want and it can
be or it can be treated and what every
coating helps it is still a sticker it's
a good sticker but it is a thing that
it's stuck on top okay yeah Thank You
Jake it's not a sticker it's not a
sticker so what I want to say is look
I'm sorry it was unfair to call it a
sticker it's not a sticker no but it
isn't dual shot and as far as I'm
concerned a $150 keyboard has dual shot
key caps so the wording was a little
over inflammatory but the point stays
the same yes
yeah and their defense is that if your
name is Logitech you make a lot of
different keyboards for the entire world
in many different layouts and doing shot
key caps might not be feasible across
you know some of these more niche
layouts and or regions and you'll
generate complaints if some of them are
dual shot and some of them are not
totally got it still don't care a $150
keyboard should have dual shot key caps
and that's like that sucks and that's a
really annoying manufacturing thing and
all that kind of stuff and I hear that
but I would rather spend my hundred
fifty dollars on a keyboard where I'm
getting dual shot key it's a hundred and
fifty US dollars that's like a two
hundred Canadian dollar keyboards are
really expensive people and it's
wireless or whatever and that's great
but I actually don't care I've keyboard
I would be I would be pretty not stoked
about you care about wireless keyboards
um
I like our I like RGB backlighting on my
keyboards believe it or not so so no
then so no because battery for now yeah
yeah yeah apparently if they had made it
RGB backlit the battery life would be
like a day instead of six months yeah
that's right see I'm like I I just
having less cables on your desk is nice
but one of the easiest things to kill
manage on your desk is your keyboard
yeah especially in terms of permanent
cable listen no actually because it goes
right into your monitor stand so a lot
of time you have to like cross actually
I'm gonna disagree with you there
I think the keyboard is one of the
harder things someone understands have
cable management slots some of them
don't all very few yes like monitor
makers have got to be some of the most
oblivious out there when it comes to
like building functionality into their
product yeah so yeah but like I guess
from my desk it's pretty easy because I
have my mixer right there so I just
pinched those cable runs in between the
mixer and the monitors and themselves
but like a lot of money you have like
you know legs that come out like this
right that can be annoying I have to let
it go around the ones I'm thinking of
their feet are up and they taper down
like this you can put the cable right in
there okay alright so that works there's
there it's it's not that difficult to
manage and I would rather like I
understand that the battery life is
gonna be huge I would rather just never
worry about it personally so doc swag
posted on the forum the pixel two and
the pixel two XL da and this is a great
little spec sheet Wow fantastic
so basically better camera than before
yeah
spec wise it's a modern phone yep so
it's exactly what you would expect
pretty much four gigs ram 64 / 128 gig
storage it's got pretty much the same
battery life as the previous pics are
pretty much the same battery capacity as
the previous pixels give or take DCI p3
screens that's pretty cool
same resolutions as before except the XL
it has a different aspect
ratio the patil Emily okay
no headphone jack is this a deal-killer
for you no really I don't listen to how
interesting music on my like it's it's
not a positive I disagree with it I
don't like it it wouldn't deal kill the
phone for me if that makes sense
okay I don't listen to music on my
headphones for my phone that often okay
because I know you're a pixel fan
yeah and it's water-resistant now which
I know was a huge deal and I'm missing
wondering about this I'm hoping they
fixed this it's cloth oh yeah the the
earpiece the the earpiece grille on the
pixel and pixel XL not the pixel to in
pixel XL to is cloth and people go in
there and try to clean it and mine's
like not looking that great because it
like absorbs gunk over the year dish
that I've used it and you can't clean it
because if you try to scrape it you'll
rip the cloth there's pictures of people
that have done it it's so stupid there's
a lot of like really weird stupid things
that were overlooked that will hopefully
have been fixed one of them is a water
resistance you've checked out the colors
yeah like kind of blue just black or
clearly white the names are weird I I
don't know I I kind of like the Panda
look yeah okay I think it looks alright
I think out of all of the phones the
pixels are kind of boring if that makes
sense like they're not sleek and sexy
they called the design iconic would you
agree with that no oh I don't think it's
a bad thing necessarily I just think
it's it's it doesn't stand out it's not
iconic it's the like opposite of iconic
and there's glass on the back so
everyone's probably just gonna want to
skin it anyways so I don't know you know
it's funny a lot of people a lot of
people in the in the twitch chat not
upset about know three and a half mil
jack because my okay my thing is yeah
they have all the adapters the main
times that I use headphones on my phone
is when I'm travel
and it's usually my active
noise-cancelling headphones that have a
carrying case that have their cable in
the carrying case
sure I can just have the adapter in yep
like it's the eye I use headphones with
my phone so little that it's not a big
deal okay all the people who are upset
are flipping the math out right now oh
yeah because they are upset okay okay
okay I got it I got a mic in my car
I use bluetooth you can buy Bluetooth
dongles where you plug your like
headphones or whatever into it and then
it interfaces with your phone so you can
turn your wired headphones into
Bluetooth headset that's super cheap
they're ridiculous actually five dollars
they work on it really well they hold
charge for a really long time it's it's
not that bad I don't like it I don't
think it's worth it I think it's a bad
design move I think it's not worth
making the phone thinner at all because
the phone doesn't need to be thinner I
think it's very stupid it's not a deal
breaker for me personally all right
let's draw pull it baby we've got people
who want a straw pull ok just everybody
stop everybody stop talking on the
twitch chat so I can and I can totally
understand why people would be upset
straw whole strap let's drop pull it so
I'm like I'm okay I used to carry my
headphones loose in my pocket until I
lost so many ear tips and broke a fair
number of pairs of headphones and now I
use a carrying case that has a little
pocket in it but I keep my stupid
lightning adapter which is the same
carrying case I carry and now I'll my
head earbuds now I'll put now I'll put a
type-c adapter in there too I guess yeah
along with an extra ear tip and mine on
microphone backup cable like I'm clearly
working around this but it it is a bit
of a pain in the butt for me because
I'll go and I'll like pull them out and
I'll be like alright I'm using that
phone that's a pretty nice use case I
know I know and I think you also use
headphones with your phone more than
every single day yeah every single day
multiple times a day I use them in each
use case on top of new shoes yes and
it's still not game breaking for you
right
I mean your favorite phones your iPhone
isn't it yeah I like the iPhone 8 best
right now but um like it sucks I don't
like it I would really prefer there was
a jack there I do not care about the
thickness that you lose by losing a jack
well let's talk about niche people for a
minute here I also still have an iPhone
6 that I specifically have so I can jack
in and like like okay you know that I
listen to show nicely do so I
specifically still own an iPhone 6 so
that I don't have to have an adapter / I
can charge it and didn't you also carry
another phone for that earlier or was it
an iPod or something yeah cuz they're
off cycle cuz this one literally runs
all night and the other one runs all day
so I charge this one in the morning
scary and all in anyways so I usually
would be carrying an old phone anyway
that's true this is true not that it
meets your point at all I'm just saying
you would have the phone anyways I would
I would
so 66% of people that they were said
that they were mad yep and that's not
surprising and I'm rising though is that
34 percent said they weren't mad weren't
mad you also isn't surprising if 66%
said they were mad you didn't ask if it
was a deal breaker
because I would have said mad but it's
not a deal breaker but it's a not a deal
breaker I would prefer to lose the
headphone jack but gain water resistance
and no longer have a stupid cloth thing
there and I have front-facing speakers
which was super cool all right and the
squeeze thing I don't really care and
like a few other things that are nice
about the phone that I would trade the
headphone jack for I think it's stupid I
would love to have all of those things
and a headphone jack because that makes
way more freaking sense so I am mad but
it's yeah it would not deal break the
phone for me so this is kind of crazy
last the last net linked
don't do so for now it would appear as
though the channel that Luke and I both
started our YouTube careers on you know
is in limbo in limbo it would be the
most the most kind word to probably use
area so they haven't uploaded anything
since three days ago when a video
entitled X 399 nvme raid support DJI
local data mode no more net linked for
now went up so most of the NCIX tech
tips team is gone so that's was me at
one point and was Luke at one point and
there's not those people anymore
yeah but was also wheels then Julia
Anthony Reilly Jack who else am I
thinking of here how did Jack am I am I
missing anyone was oh I mean Barrett
Riley's Riley's brother was Esther legs
part of the team Esther was part of the
team at some point so of all of those
people the people who are gone all of
them yeah that makes sense
in in the last episode he did say that
he's gonna be trying to make videos
still sometimes he was saying hopefully
one a week but was like do not hold me
to that so we'll see how that comes out
so we'll go ahead and like I can maybe
address some of the some of the comments
here you know rip me if LTT were to ever
go under don't worry we're not going
anywhere we're good man yeah we're like
super awesome and good yeah so a lot of
people seem to be wondering about how
this could happen to a channel with lots
of subscribers and
actually like okay viewership yeah like
you're never gonna do well on like mesh
Wi-Fi or whatever but you know look the
core stuff net linked is doing sixty a
hundred thousand views and episode
that's not bad
that's that should be sustainable for a
team of a couple people yeah so people
are asking like what happened so it
seems to have a lot more to do with
decision business decisions being made
by the parent company so I'm not gonna
comment on sort of oh I don't want to
comment on anything that I'm being told
in confidence like I still know people
there so I know stuff that that like
people don't I'll say really vague stuff
then because I haven't talked to these
people so you can just look at NC X and
how they're doing right now they're
closing stores people have been departed
from the YouTube channel you can see
different I mean someone works here now
that didn't before that used to work
there yeah the writings sort of on the
wall and it seems to be going rather
quickly
that's all outside perspective haven't
had conversations with anyone in the
company stuff so there you go it's an
end of an era and I've got to say it's
pretty it's pretty sad for me actually
cuz this was like kind of my baby
well like the store that you worked out
of and I used to buy all of my sorry oh
yeah yeah so it's yeah it's kind of
tough because this is something that
like I started and put my heart and soul
into and became like a part of my
personal identity like this was what
turned me into a youtuber yeah and to
see it kind of go down like this was
really its kind of thing and sad
actually because it was weird at first
to no longer be a part of that team like
the team making the ncx tech tips videos
when you and I did it for so long yeah
then it's gonna be even weirder having
that not exist now people in twitch chat
are saying that we should buy NCIX yes
that would be that would be that would
be a Wow um how how how does this idea
fail let me count tell so hard yeah yeah
buying companies that will control
really losing money is like good
business you know people are asking like
you know guilty T's about going anywhere
right and it is because we don't make
decisions like that is doing great just
great actually no you know what though I
would love to buy the channel someone in
Chad says hi ed oh I'd buy it
oh that weird I I would buy some of the
people that come with it I'm not gonna
name any names but I wouldn't buy all of
them
besides no people come with it at this
would you rename it and just make it a
tech news channel I think we could just
call it like we could just call it like
an ex tech tips or something like that
we could just like change it a little
bit yeah cuz really weird
getting the NZXT like and we could just
make it straight tech news yeah just get
rid of every format that wasn't that
linked um cuz I actually I liked the net
linked format I would like I would see a
neckline thumbnail surprised if I could
know what it is good they changed it a
lot from what like if you look at the
early ones they were trash hmm like they
changed it a lot they made it more you
to be they made it more upbeat they made
it more fun and you know I would see it
from Nayla be like oh yeah what's going
on with that and I'd click it and like
you know four minutes and pass it be
like oh I just watch the whole video
which doesn't happen a lot for me I
don't watch a lot of YouTube videos like
I actually like that linked so soon ed
yeah so I would I wouldn't mind bringing
back net linked but I'll tell you now
that my relationship with NCIX is
not at the best it's been in the last 10
years and I don't even think for a fair
offer they'd be interested in selling to
me so I could be wrong I mean I could
always reach out and he liked you you
guys still want that channel I mean with
how YouTube treats subscribers and stuff
right now it might not be too bad to
just start another one um I think one
point one nil has a value because you
can build up a big subscriber base back
to like getting notifications faster
than you can like build a subscriber
base from nothing yeah we wouldn't be
building subscriber base or nothing I
would also just be like I would be like
taking back my baby no I know yeah that
would be part I know yeah I think this
probably most of it that's something
part of it yeah but like obviously we
understand it if I had to and this I can
comment on because I haven't really
talked to anybody about it but if I had
to guess rather than you know do
something sensible with it they're just
gonna run it into the ground if I had to
guess I would say they're just gonna
pull what tigerdirect and Newegg did
before them they're gonna having no
concept of what made it good they're
gonna bring in some random outsiders to
try to make videos they're gonna have no
idea why people watch videos they're
gonna try to just sell stuff and it's
gonna be a complete disaster and it's
gonna just crater have to like archive
some of these old videos yeah
good like this do you remember doing
this oh the ultimate water cooling guide
part 3 where we had to like build the
whole thing then tear the whole thing
apart and then like build it again I was
like was that an all-night shoot I think
that was like two all night shoes I
don't remember
cuz there was part one two and three how
many views does it have to at least get
a lot of views it's really good for that
time seven hundred and seventy eight
thousand not bad yeah alright I think
we've got time for maybe one more topic
okay it's the Intel show apparently cuz
I'm
super-super not stoked on this posted by
Oh doesn't say who on the forum but like
war stn this is just Intel will no
longer be providing perk or turbo
frequencies making motherboard tuning
impossible so you won't be able to alter
your overclocks perk or so extreme tax
has when we queried Intel as to why
they've decided to no longer officially
disclosed perk or turbo frequencies they
said we're no longer disclosing this
level of detail as it is proprietary to
Intel Intel only specifies processor
frequencies for base and single core
turbo in our processor marketing and
technical collateral such as Ark and not
the multi-core turbo frequencies we're
aligning communications to be consistent
all turbo frequencies are opportunistic
given their dependency on system
configuration and workload bs pretty
annoying basically what you're doing is
you're making us go measuring yeah why
why are you wasting our time this is
like this is like Apple not disclosing
the capacity of their batteries to make
someone take it apart it's like you're
not concealing anything you're just you
know you're just inconveniencing
everybody does not even know reason
literally not even reverse engineering
it's just trying something like it's not
difficult to figure I just can't even
it's just extremely annoying for all of
the consumers so yeah I guess that's all
I really had to say about that I'm sort
of surprised okay somebody's posting
salts in the chat
I was surprised people weren't doing
salt tips salt tips but did you see that
clip no I ate salt and it was a mistake
I didn't think it was gonna be that bad
because I was talking about like people
being salty about something well there
was like one of those big ones and I was
like oh it wasn't like fully open or
anything but like for a bit I was
actually okay and I was gonna just keep
going with the video and then it like
hit me all at once is pretty bad cuz
there's salts that you can eat like if
you get like salt mixes and stuff you
can have like
what is the really small one a
tablespoon yeah teaspoon teaspoon yeah
um I'm not very uh up with the whole
etiquette thing aims gone okay I'd be a
lot more sad if this was a msn yeah I
was sad when this was in the Sun there
you go I like had a dream about msn like
in the last three days I don't know ever
exactly when but man if it came back
suddenly I would jump on that train so
fast and then they would Skype if I the
crap out of it and I would bail out so
fast
um Microsoft edge is coming to iOS and
Android cool I guess I can use that for
like accounts that I don't want to have
signed in on the other ones I don't know
I just use other browsers for that so
it's fine and there's gonna be another
BlackBerry there's a huge thing on this
that we haven't talked about at all yet
all right unlike anybody oh wow we're
doing it at the very end of the show
when no one's watching holy crap we suck
we're really it's it's funny cuz we're
like in the advertising business and
then when we need to advertise our own
things we just suck at it I know we're
not the greatest marketers also it is
like we often just don't market it
anyway there's a blackberry phone that's
coming oh cool um holy crap how have we
not talked about this floatplane um kind
of a big deal
scrapyard Wars is up people don't even
believe me that it's there really yeah
okay now hold on I got this I I will
show the people like we don't have a
trailer we had a trailer for the the
like cleanup vlogs we didn't get a
trailer for scrapyard Wars
oh yeah it's a two-week window a
two-week window ah long story oh yeah we
could still have a trailer yeah but it
would be too early yeah no that no that
makes no we'd have a trailer for a
floatplane yeah but we're gonna have it
it trust me it makes sense sure we don't
want to tease something two weeks in
advance what we want to do it now
because no no but I know I guess yeah we
we don't want to create again more salt
than you have to I get it but it's there
what do we got tech quickie bias
lighting as fast as possible that's a
good thumbnail it's pretty sad is there
Cyprian behind the scenes demolition
vlog yeah done don't oh yeah we
demolished our sets so that was the
thing this was a simultaneous release
the car I 780 700 K so you guys have
probably seen that the ultimate mega
workstation got oh I think that was a
simultaneous release as well because of
Coolermaster case sponsorship trackball
Mouse review yeah that's all these two
dudes red ball it's kind of neat yeah I
wonder how well it's gonna sell I have
no idea probably not particularly
amazingly yeah but like I'm sure they're
prepared for that like I'm sure it all
I'll be fine
scrap yard war heck yeah scrap yard war
six part one sponsored by D brand holy
crap J's two cents holy crap Demitri
from hardware connects holy crap hold on
a second hold on a second I got like a
quick spoiler I got a quick spoiler holy
crap you can hardly recognize Linus in
this outfit how will anyone ever
recognize him on the street he's going
incognito I love the glasses wait for it
