to be about the special asuste features
a su special features rather on the TS
mini windows home server so why don't we
start with a swm so a su system
web-based management software so
cleverly named so it's an interface that
allows you to conveniently manage your
home server status via windows home
server console so let's go into that
over here a swm so this is just a
Windows Home Server plugin there are
actually tons available on WWE got
served co uk but these are some custom
ones that a sous is included with their
TS mini so the first one here is you can
monitor your system fan there are two
fans and the TS mini they are both
working excellent you can monitor your
motherboard temperatures you can monitor
your cat row a cat alright you can
monitor your CPU temperature right now
it's running it 50 degrees which is
perfectly safe you can monitor your
disks as well as your dries i'm not sure
what the difference between disks and
drives is maybe we'll find out they look
the same you can monitor your network
connection so here it is showing me how
much of my network is being used right
now actually you hear something we can
do why don't we just go like this shared
folders and let's see what happens if I
actually copy a folder into videos for
example network utilization should go up
and it looks like it doesn't refresh all
that often that's okay memory
utilization this has one gig of memory
so it shows me how much of that is being
used how much page file is used and cpu
overall cpu utilization and breaks it
down by core it is a dual core atom so
inventory there's a lot more stuff here
that i can also go into if i feel like
it and configuration Oh event
configuration vent configuration let's
have a look bios flashes in here there's
all kinds of good stuff here so you can
have it notify you in the event okay so
you can set it so things like
motherboard fans when it goes below a
certain level that's an event I believe
so let me see ya so here's the the low
monitor here's high low so critical
thresholds are 600 okay cool and so yeah
you can set it so it'll send you an
email or it'll send you um what else can
it send you hey mom looks like a pretty
neat piece of software let's move on to
the next one asus webstorage so a tus
web storage allows you to enjoy it one
year free online space and back up your
files to your home server with an
internet connection you can access and
share any files whenever you want and
wherever you are okay well when this
home server allows you to do a whole lot
of web storage on your own but I'm sure
that there is a value to this I'm not
going to bother setting it up for now
but that is one of the features that a
sous does include this one I saved the
best for last this one has all kinds of
cool stuff in here so my personal
favorite one is the backup tab so this
allows you to take your external storage
source in this case it's my USB flash
drive you can select any folders that
you want you select a home server
destination folder and then you click
backup boom so you throw that in one of
your duplicated folders so you have a
quick easy way to plug something into
your home server back it up and have it
duplicated you don't worry about it
anymore very cool file manager okay this
one I'm not quite as certain about so
you can copy delete edit the files and
folders between external storage devices
in your home server so this would be a
way to manually copy edit and delete
this one has a little bit less
usefulness to me because you do always
have the option of using remote desktop
connection to access your home server if
you don't know how to do that it's quite
simple you just go to remote desktop
connection type in the name of your home
server and then you can actually do
stuff like this on your own from there
so you're not technically supposed to
use remote desktop connection to access
the home server they don't recommend it
a big warning is going to come up and
tell me not to do it but you can always
just go into shared folders on home
server go into my computer I mean it's
just a computer right so from there I
can access my my
flash drive so this one is not not a
huge one but synchronization is great
too because synchronization allows you
to just same thing you automatically
synchronize except this one instead of
backing up only from the external device
into the home server is actually able to
go either way so first let's say a
document you've been working on at home
and at work if you're storing one copy
on your USB Drive and one copy on your
home server at home you can set it so
that it will just synchronize and it'll
update to the latest version of the file
so that's a very cool feature as well so
a sous has included a pretty neat little
software suite in addition to all the
stuff that's already included with
Windows Home Server and thank you for
checking out my episode on the exclusive
assu software with the TS mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
