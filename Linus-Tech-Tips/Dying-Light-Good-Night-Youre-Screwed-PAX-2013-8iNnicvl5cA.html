brought to you by western digital Intel
and steel series hey guys we're here
with Tim checking out dying light and I
just got to try the day and night
playthrough that was pretty insane can
you tell me exactly what happened in
there well thank light is a first-person
open-world action survivor game with day
and night cycle and right here at the
PAX Prime we focus on the nighttime part
of the game so the game what during the
day you are the haunted you you have
that advantage of a zombies that you are
that intelligent human with a weapon in
hand during the night the rules change
because the zombies get more aggressive
and they get more intelligent they can
climb on top of things just as good as
you they can chase you actively so you
really have to bring your top notch game
to the table and and that's what you
experienced I think yeah definitely
winter became nighttime the game evolves
essentially one of the main things that
I noticed is as you're running by the
zombies they'll kind of get this little
red glow explosion thing can you explain
to me what's going on right there but
that's just just just to tell you that
they evolve so when they evolve they
turn into this night forms and the night
forms well well there are something that
you don't really want to meet them in a
dark alley or in a supermarket or
whatever you just don't want to have
nothing to do with those guys yes I I
felt that you didn't want anything to do
with anything basically at nighttime
just get away and stay in your traps um
the slogan that you guys have good night
good luck that's very yeah he said when
it went nighttime he was like good luck
you have to get back to your grace it's
very applicable there's not too many
slogans that are that applicable to the
game what is your favorite part of this
game well I think the natural movement
system and I we get that from previous
so people like you play the game and
they always tell us that hey the natural
movement system it is something unique
it is something that I haven't
experienced before the fluidity of it
that that like it's very natural to you
for you to traverse the environment and
we try to give you that freedom of
traversing the environments so if you
see something that's within your reach
that in real life you you would really
could be able to reach grab and climb on
top of it you can do
in our game and since you play as this
athletic characterized by cruise
specialists and well you have those such
assessment options that it gives you
that freedom definitely I noticed
especially coming from more of a pc
background when I touched the controller
I was automatically out of my element
but it wasn't hard to pick up by the end
of the demo I could tell I was much
better than when I first started and
some free movement style mechanics and
games can be more hand holdy than others
and some of them you just hold the
button and it kind of does everything
for you I liked this one was a little
bit more interactive you had to kind of
decide what you're going to do that was
really nice to see I know coming from
dead island it's not the same game so
what are the unique features of this
game you find well the natural movement
of course the day/night cycle so these
are the two things that really
differentiate that one from the island
but I think that what that island really
was a very basic game very very simple
game it was hack and slash game with
zombies with first-person perspective
right now we always try to give you
these options so you can always in a
fight either run that try to be smart
about it and use the traps that you've
just said maybe use some gadgets that
you having an inventor like the
firecrackers you can show firecrackers
at one location and the zoms crowd
around it for a second so that opens up
new ways for you so this is a game about
freedom about options about and about
decisions and I hope that people will
make the right decisions because because
if they if they make our if they make a
wrong decision then they screwed
basically it yeah talking about traps
and the firecrackers in that kind of
stuff what are some of the nice
interesting unique mechanics that you
have I know there was the the car trap
that was probably my favorite one what
other examples are there but well the
car but she said the car alarm job is
really my favorite as well what it does
when you activate it the car alarm goes
off and the zombies Crowder on the car
and then the car explode so they like
flying all around the screen there's
also this like say lights trap light
trap is like the survivors rewired light
lamp posts and when you are being chased
during the night and you activate that
the death trap the whole intersection is
like it's flooded with light so
zombies get disoriented and you get this
few of precious second few precious
seconds to escape so that's the the
stuff like that and we have like eff
that few dozens of things like like that
in our game that's awesome and those few
couple seconds that he said with the
light trap are definitely needed it's
not like a few couple seconds it's not a
big deal it's that's a really big deal
how would someone go about getting this
game and what platforms can I get it on
the gamecocks that comes out next year
for pc ps3 ps4 xbox 360 and xbox one but
what's what's important is that the
whole game can be played in co-op so you
can play the game in four player co-op
from A to Z but it is dropping drop out
so you can start the game solar then you
play for a couple of hours then maybe a
friend joins in you play together for a
couple of hours but you don't have to
stick together you're just in the same
game world so you can go into separate
directions you can do different missions
and after he drops out you just continue
solo main story and also a couple days
ago we've announced our new mode BD
zombie is a PvP mode for our game so
that's a mode that allows you to play as
a zombie and invite in invade other
people's games so and you also get that
like special character progression
systems like set of zombie skills that
you build along the way so at the end of
it you become that ultimate zombie and
you can go mess with your friends games
and that's something that really is cool
that would be a lot of fun just screw
now with all my friends that's really
cool and it's nice to see that you guys
have co-op up to four players because
I've noticed a trend lately as that
co-op isn't that really good thing but a
lot of people are looking for it so it's
great to see a game like this which
would work so well with co-op to
actually be implementing it thank you
for showing us around dying light that
was great if you want to see the rest of
