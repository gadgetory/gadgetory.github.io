got a great show for you guys today
unfortunately you aren't watching it
you're watching the land show lol you
know I really feel like when I'm old
I want to rid of those Muppets names the
hecklers the old man hecklers oh I have
to watch the Muppets in about 25 years I
don't I don't know well I think I know
what you're talking about but my goal in
life is to basically be those guys when
I'm old
Muppet hecklers I don't know I don't
know what their name well that's not
very difficult to do ah oh la la yeah
okay so they're supposed are they
supposed to be sort of like weird
versions like Siskel and Ebert or
something yeah yeah I think so I think
so and you know everything everything is
a one-liner with them like this is a
great show
yeah great uh putting me to sleep Wow I
aspire to nothing more actually that's
going to be very easy to do you're
setting the bar very low for yourself
I think I'm basically I think I'm
basically there now with lawyers you're
so old yeah so that's all I have to
achieve you have to age to do it that's
it to do everything I want out of my
life I just have to continue to make it
around the Sun like another 40 or so
more times and then I'll and then I'm
great you live in Canada they told me
this is a safe country so it was
probably fine all right so welcome to
the land show you guys we've got a bunch
of great topics for you today including
Intel uncharacteristically throwing
shade at the competition which for the
first time in like a decade is AMD it's
like the insecurity this is dripping out
of the computer screen right it was it
was pretty brutal it was pretty brutal
yeah like also AMD's rise in thread
Ripper and rise in three have tons of
new updates in a video post that they
created earlier on this week the skylake
x have erm and thermal paste and power
consumption mess has
explored by tom's hardware and we've got
John here to specially cover a legal
topic that we wanted to get into which
one was it where there were the Zillow
the Zillow copyright infringement case
which sounds a lot less interesting than
it actually is
there we go Zillow's a massive website
tries to sue a satirical blogger over
photos that Zillow doesn't even own so
brilliant yeah so it's going to be a
good one so let's go ahead and roll the
intro and we'll see you on the other
side roll the intro yes it worked I
think we might be a little bit out of
focus well that's okay I'm never focused
ah I mean you did just make the joke
right on in my head that's so I give you
credit for that you won't miss it
ah okay alright I fix it comment coming
to Red Rocks and put that back so that
the intro will roll properly next time
that is indeed why I do that
did Twitter just crash how you even how
even do this is it Twitter soldiers a
Crohn's fault I load I don't know
it could very easily be bellows over
here playing with the focus yeah oh
thank you fella that is that is just
wonderful and the tweet is up damn is I
didn't even know that so this is how
double tweets happen okay Chrome thank
you alright so the original topic here
is from wow I actually managed to
prepare even less than usual for the
land show today I do not have my HDMI
cable plugged in and somehow I managed
to my muscle memory didn't help me here
I managed to put my mouse in the wrong
spot all right we're not boy scale we're
getting really prepared we're going to
jump right in this was originally posted
over on Ars Technica and oh we're doing
with this okay in a nutshell here we go
- the screen is it going to work is it
going to work is it go very go okay okay
so take me through this John what is
going on here so
as you can see on the screen grab there
yes I called McMansion hell and for
those of you who don't know or probably
mostly people not from the US yeah
what's in the Canton a McMansion is a
large yet relatively cheaply built house
it was um they're available all over the
place in the US before um the housing
bubble burst in the late 2000s and
they're they're larger but like I said
slightly cheaper cheap more cheaply
built built houses and so this um this
blogger started this website called
McMansion hell and this blogger is I
think an architectural student so she
was going through and posting all these
pictures of homes that she considered to
be McMansions and telling people oh
these are terrible buildings have
terrible architecture here the reasons
why and this is a regular blog that she
alright it was pretty funny yeah it was
pretty popular she has lots of visitors
who liked her sort of snarky take on Oh
lol you could scrape these windows off
of the paint knife this is terrible
so she got a lot of these pictures from
Zillow which is like this huge sort of
like real estate site if you want to
sell your house a lot of people use the
low to post pictures of the house on
there so sure okay yeah
anyway Zillow got wind of this and they
so they sent her a very angry cease and
desist letter saying oh you're
infringing on copyright and you can't do
this and this is that so um so this kind
of blew up she freaked out like wires to
snakes oh yeah so she could lose a job
but Zillow didn't take these photos no
they didn't which is like a huge wrinkle
in this case so the photos that people
like they upload them to Zillow right so
if you want to sell your house you take
your own photos of your own house and
you upload them the photos are yours and
when so I had a look at what are we
doing here that's what you sound like
sorry go ahead that's what I found a lot
okay thank you I know what I sound like
I have plenty of people in the tech wiki
comments hey John do you know that you
sound like are you from the south
yeah whatever where where are you from
yeah it's what what do you have in your
mouth what's wrong with your voice
anyway so
I think someone is asking that one okay
anyway but all right so you take the
pictures you put them on Zillow I had to
look at Zillow's Terms of Service and
they say okay if you put pictures on
Zillow you're giving us a non-exclusive
license to to use them
yeah that's pretty typical like even on
the LTTE forum I believe your text
content we actually say we own but
pictures posted we did something along
those lines
and okay so if you look at if you look
at its Zillow can even sue because
that's the big one of the big questions
is what do they even have standing to
sue and standing in walls of them it's
kind of a simple concept understand
right is if you're going to take someone
to court you have to be a party to
whatever the dispute is if someone walks
in here and punches lines in the mouth
and knocked a few this guy out yeah so I
can't smile aver well you make it you
could I think in your behalf my
livelihood is at stake because my boss
can't come to work and shoot the videos
that I write therefore but so yeah it's
a bit more tenuous but but if let's say
you work of some complete frickin random
yeah yeah you can't sue because you have
nothing and well well if someone's okay
suppose that lion smile were just
friends and we're walking out of street
together so most of your friends ha ha
ha
suppose someone comes up to him just
punched him in the face
I can't sue that that guy on line staff
he has to do himself though the concept
is that how how the constant applies
here man I've had way too much caffeine
and it's all over the place the way the
constant applies here is that the fifth
circuit which is it was the thickness of
the knife I'm sorry but the ninth
circuit is the u.s. very influential
appeals court right below the Supreme
Court yeah there was a case from a
couple years ago where they ruled that
you have you can have standing to sue
about infringement of someone else's
copyright only if you have some sort of
exclusive right which in their own Terms
of Service do not have right if I don't
know if it says non-exclusive
specifically but but it doesn't
specifically say it's occurring right
what you would have to do correct so so
this is whether they even have
to sue the McMansion hello blogger is
very very very unclear I would my if I
were to hazard a guess I would say they
do not but it didn't stop her from being
embroiled in this big legal battle she's
got some pretty prominent IP lawyers on
her side right now but um it's it's an
interesting question about you know who
could have dankmemes forever it
absolutely could who gets to use Pepe
which like would yes by this
conversation is important by the way
which is why we're having an old land
show but honestly I'm still not over how
Loki burned I just got about a minute or
two ago there the friends come proposed
we were friends no no no I'll find the
state without saying just let the record
show I said just instead of friends plus
co-worker slash lives people are on
Facebook our current status would be
it's complicated
okay okay see what you've done you've
gone you've gone on you've made it
something it is and now there's going to
be more horrible like fanfiction written
about this Thanks and now yeah you're
the one who invited it you're the one
who invited you know what I have lose
you join us come on let's have Luke join
us for a fan fiction extravaganza if
we're going to invite it we might as
well invite it what's happening it's
just that I just what I don't want you
to come between us
oh I use the words just friends as a
tool to imply it illegal hypothetical
involving me and Linus and things
happened so quick get naked chance
twitch chat room
speaking of violating the terms of
service yeah yeah basically
villo still says um they they what do
they want they wanted to take down the
photos oh okay but what what what's
interesting about this another thing is
interesting about this is that even if
some court said zero has standing to sue
which I doubt but if it gets to that
phase yeah um one of the biggest things
that courts look for whether to
determine if a use of the copyrighted
photo or something is fair use that term
gets thrown around a lot fair use yeah
is the
on the market for the work right a heck
is going to like start selling their
random pictures of the random McMansions
and make tons of money off of them right
you know so and I think so there's a
there's a strong argument I'm not saying
it'll win necessarily but there's a
strong argument saying there's no real
market for these pictures that's being
affected right so if you almost argue
fair use but again like I said there's a
standing issue may not even get to that
point so okay good yeah there's multiple
hoops to jump through in in law if
you've ever fought a traffic ticket I'm
sure you've figured that out so all
right oh yeah thanks John I'm going to
have Luke tag in because he actually
just arrived back from the one and only
Silicon Valley can we talk about the
juice area real fast before he tagged
bail we can talk about the juice air oh
okay hold on is that even in the dock I
put it in there like 45min alright
alright let's bring it really quickly
we're bringing up the juice arrow tell
me about okay so this is also from ours
have we ever talked about this thing
before I know we have in all the channel
have we ever talked about it like on the
wine show I cuz I don't believe not a
much we have yet I think a little bit
yeah I think because a little bit we
said yeah it's done okay I'll give you a
really quick TL DR if also if you've
seen any is of critical zone YouTube I'm
sure you've seen this where he Lampoon
this ridiculous thing called a juice
arrow and it's it is a juicer that
originally cost $800 save since drop the
price to 400 and now it's going to be
down to below 200 according to this
article from ARS technica but all it is
is this thing they ship you packets you
know they look like they look like giant
you know hot or cold packets or whatever
they cost about five to seven dollars
each you put them inside this thing to
show the door on it you press a button
and it has to be connected to the
Internet at all times it squeezes the
juice packet and two minutes later you
have the glass of juice that's literally
what it does and is originally sold for
seven or Fe was actually $700 but it was
very expensive okay so so apparently
they've cut the price already they cut
the price down to $200 and they've laid
off a bunch of their staff and my
question is my question was why it was
so expensive to begin with and
apparently this thing was this
it was ridiculously over-engineer some
website did a teardown of it and it was
a really really high build quality which
is great but sorry Oh a VE right okay
okay a VE did the did the teardown is
that right Luke okay so he did the
teardown and the thing was like I said
absurdly over engineer and all was doing
was just squeezing a bag of like fruits
and vegetables to make juice out of it
um so they decide to lower the price
down to two hundred dollars but I'm
wondering why not just get an actual
like baller juicer from Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond or somewhere or Amazon for that
price and you can even get like an
Amazon fresh description and have the
veggies and the fruits delivered to your
door if you're too lazy to go to the
store to buy them instead of instead of
this and I mean cuz you see is there a
universe where you would find this
useful
why does like if you want to fresh juice
after a badminton game or something till
I have a Vitamix okay so basically
everything else can just get crapped on
Sonu Sonu there we go and the stupid
thing is that like I see even at the
$400 price point you could get a used
Vitamix which by the way will probably
run for like 50 years because those
things are unbelievable for the same
price and then you could put literally
anything like you could put a child in a
Vitamix we don't advise you do that have
never happened
well I can't say it's never happened it
never happened to my children or in my
presence or at my instruction
there you go am i covering all my legal
bases right now III think you or you
know III know that I know the small
children cry but please don't put them
in the Vitamix anyway okay what what uh
what is this modest proposal it's like
you're channeling the guy who wrote yeah
basically this is so strange
oh crap I'm hold on hold on Jonathan
wait wait goddammit
gah now you already gave me enough of a
hint Swift
okay well dang it it'll we all we all
know how intelligent you are Linus it'll
be all right so well remembering facts
is not not an indicate
of intelligence necessarily although and
completed ability to remember any facts
could be an indicator that you're not
intelligent so what does that mean about
people who remember a lot of facts
nothing
yeah I'll say this I say that I say
that's accurate
all right of course a twitch chat line
is like splendid children confirms no I
don't like them why would I put them in
a blender if I liked them wait what are
we talking about okay so the flavor of
dead children aren't you are onto our
next topic
so uh thanks John Thank You Linus I feel
like I'm supposed to shake your hand but
like you work here anyway every day
that's like it yeah I know but it's like
a I feel like we're like having guests
on like a talk show right now and like
that's what they always do they're
always like yeah John welcome to the
show
hey John thanks for being on and we'll
see you after the break yeah you don't
brush books
bulchek in my hand no you're not um
you're nada
who's doing the light show now whole
bear yeah cold air I'm not cool there
you know what thanks for having me on
the show yeah I really I really
appreciate what's up here if you look so
bad I really appreciate the way he
called me not a friend then he's like
you're not cool they're fine huh
okay so do you want to talk about where
you were like on a very high level yeah
and hell yeah let's do it
I got freakin you got burned you know
that for one to only one side of your
face I'm like what are you doing
okay fine is my radar that bad your
brave heart away supposed to catch up oh
it's pretty bitter brave heart okay are
you doing I went to twitch with the hang
with my friend John and at one point
time he's like let's go get lunch at the
pier didn't realize how far away the
pier was so we walked out like a very
long it's like pier and they're like
numbered or whatever right I like it
yeah sure and then had to walk all the
way back
trendy in the Sun the whole time yeah
well I'm going my like ridiculously
heavy backpack yeah I got picked up on
that yeah yeah I was a it was an
experience huh how's your trip it was
really good it was fun checking out
which they are a crate
the company be careful what you say
need I remind you what benevolent
overlords we are we are leaning on right
now to broadcast this here stream
subscribe interesting oh oh lordy it's
Luke's mom oh good
hello my favorite hi try how many times
have I talked to you week about
sunscreen how much time I didn't know
how long the walk was gonna be your
mom's on my side for a change you know
you know you know when we went to Mexico
mom lafrana air you know what happened
she didn't bring any sunscreen at all he
asked me to buy him a tube of sunscreen
after he'd already been burned which by
the way is not how sunscreen works as
you well know and then he didn't pay me
back for it I didn't really remember the
story that he said he didn't pay me back
for it I was like ads from batur he is
now your problem that's a big step we do
shake hand
hey listen I'm not signing any document
yeah taking legal custody this guy
getting adopted when you're in your like
mid-20s
heck yeah yeah but successfully Wow
hangs up even when I agree with your mom
she still finds a way to burn me even
when we're on the same team maybe not as
bad as maybe not as bad as I got Bert
yeah not as that as you got brain but
yeah it was it was a fun trip
they have like a they have multiple 5vs5
gaming lounges in their studio or say do
they have a bar of course it's like an
open bar on Fridays at least for the
team that I was talking to there like
time policy they have unlimited vacation
they show up any time they want before
lunch is served at
which I don't know the exact time that
that is it's not noon but it's like
whenever it's served a twitch and yeah
so when am I getting your two weeks
notice no no no I I think I'm going I
get a month yeah at least a month yeah
yes Lots okay I can train up a new Luke
in that time no problem no problem at
all
yeah there's a fun trip though yeah it's
goodie cool okay um so let's move on to
our first topic this is actually like
okay well spicy so here's the thing you
know you go hang around you know /ji or
whatever and you'll find you'll find
plenty of hate for Intel and their
business practices and their
communications and you'll find it hate
for anything Intel but for the most part
for the last you know that eight or so
years when they haven't really had a
real competitor Intel has put on a very
good and it's up to you the individual
viewer to pick your next word this is
like a choose your own adventure book
okay you can decide whether it's whether
it's having a pretty professional image
or a pretty professional facade it's up
to you I don't care but for the most
part they've been fairly professional
and fairly dignified in their corporate
communications and their slide decks in
their presentations to partners and to
the press so this was originally posted
by Finn Hulk's fist on the forum spin
Hulk's fist I love that name any any
nordic names are just frickin awesome
hulk this like nordic nick operation
cannot possibly go wrong is to have a
name like hulk fist and the original i
thought it was weird is hulk fist oh no
I was like I don't think that's a
No okay I got you um so Intel this is
just posted by tech power up here in an
official slide deck posted the following
ok first of all there's some debate in
the industry as to a couple of things
number one as to how exactly Intel is
deriving these SMT numbers so that's
Intel hyper-threading TM and AMD's what
are they calling it I do I don't I can't
remember whatever something something
else but SMT okay so symmetrical
mometrix multi-threading yep so where
you take one core and you feed it a
couple of threads so it can process both
of them more efficiently than if it had
just processed one thread in the first
place
okay so it's unclear a couple things
number one how exactly they derive these
numbers because they don't necessarily
align with what all the sort of tech
media are seeing in number two whether
this is an applicable comparison in the
first place because Intel's basically
taken a Xeon 60 134 and they have run
clock for clock against a rise in 7
desktop chip with the clear argument
being that this is a close analog
because these are both 8 core 16 thread
processors running at 2.2 gigahertz now
to be clear probably that comparison
works fine because contrary to what the
people who got really confused by mine
and Luke's discussion about Vega
frontier Edition contrary to what those
people think architectural II hardware
wise oh yeah the consumer-grade stuff is
not often not materially different from
the enterprise-grade
stuff sometimes you'll see better
bidding a longer warranty you'll see
more functional units enabled or you'll
see some some flags enabled for features
that were turned off in order to
artificially differentiate them that's
where most of the difference comes from
so fundamentally Intel's comparison here
may not actually
you that far off hardware hardware wise
but that doesn't change that there are
other questions here as well what's the
baseline one thing I really hate about
these graphs
Swingle red so that's the other thing
you don't know if single-thread I guess
so improvement over Intel single thread
improvement over AMD single I guess say
anywhere well there's more information
on slide 22 21 okay so that's that's
fine honestly the negative 13% is just
like what that's not well there are
situations where hyper threading as well
does result in a performance loss right
but I don't think we've seen that on
Rison we haven't but that specific
workload that who knows how to protect
or not cherry-pick is honestly that's
not the thing that bothered me that much
it's not that unusual whether it's AMD
Intel or Nvidia to include some basic
performance comparisons when they're
trying to make their product look good
in a slide deck this one is one of the
ones that blew me away where Intel
basically gave themselves a check mark
for a robust ecosystem decades of
investment in software optimizations and
validation easier application to
deployment for customers and some of the
stuff on here is just like um okay hold
on a second
like hold on what okay so yeah hold on
hold on okay I'm trying to find
something just totally stupid there were
a couple that were that were really dumb
like where gigabytes on here somewhere
like what what software optimization are
you doing with gigabyte on your new
server chip that AMD doesn't here it is
so here's here's like gigabyte on here
because frickin or something
so then AMD doesn't get gigabyte on
their list of partners right not even
gigabyte really none who I'm pretty sure
that AMD works with question mark we
didn't look into it not even Super Micro
okay who I'm pretty sure that AMD is
working with on their Naples product and
by pretty sure I mean you can you can
bet on that
yeah and the list goes on and on I'm
sure AMD is talked to Microsoft okay
I'm pretty sure that conversation is
going going on right now
so they basically go X they take this
quote totally out of context expect
software optimizations needed for Naples
just like Rison which is fair but what
Intel ignores is that when they launch a
new architecture software optimizations
are needed it is it is not even
newsworthy whether it's Intel or AMD for
there to be an erratum I believe is the
singular of a ration of weird bug where
the CPU needs updated micro code and
needs maybe even a driver fix in order
to fix some kind of a weird hardware bug
that that stuff happens to both of them
and basically they're going to get
they've turn that into AMD's rise in cpu
gaming perform oh yeah okay so they put
them so they took another quote totally
out of context Rison CPU gaming
performance inhibited by lack of
optimizations so they're basically
saying look software not optimized for
therefore diapered socket implementation
likely a multi-year investment effort to
develop optimize and validate an
ecosystem that is is taking a nugget of
truth and blowing it up into a movie
theater room filled with popcorn and a
nugget is not even a kernel that's how
far off we are random little tidbit I
can't verify this because I I can't find
them but apparently there's two
Hitachi's attached is just listed twice
Oh seriously is just kind of yelling
here's the tachi hold on here we go okay
where's the other one here's a Hitachi
and here's a hell there you go yeah so
Intel works with Hitachi so much that
they Hitachi while they Hitachi so they
can hit tachi while they're attached yo
dawg they're that hard core on Hitachi I
mean for all I know there's multiples
that are in there twice because I don't
think anyone look
that closely at this slide no I don't
think legal looked at this slide or
maybe maybe they did but they were just
like yeah don't hurl a no no no I
thought IBM was in their choice but no
yeah alright okay and you know what's
the craziest part is this is that that's
not even where this ends no like I don't
even the super hardcore part if this is
my opinion no no this gets worse and
once again Oh in these black and white
terms okay okay Oh
until yes yes yes no no no no no no this
is like you know you know when you go to
one of those like it's usually slightly
ghetto websites they'll be like this is
our product a whole bunch of generally
it's for like a video ripping software
yeah right this is their product no
checkmarks they suck and sometimes it's
on nicer stuff but usually it's a little
bit more granular and they'll actually
show like yeah their software does this
thing but we do more of these things
yeah but usually it's a big no fide way
to do it yeah there is like the janky
software way is like has three red
pixels in the bottom corner
yes doesn't judgment so here me so so
let's go let's go but let's go back to
this and I'm taking inside of here
because we got it we got to look at the
slide proven system performance and
innovation inconsistent performance from
four glued together desktop dies do you
live in Hecht that Intel is neither blue
nor red but perhaps a little green right
now about infinity fabric Wow because
it's not glued together and and do I
detect some nearly decade old salt right
now from back when AMD was crapping on
Intel for gluing together single core
processors which by the way Intel was
super doing back when they released the
Pentium D series compared to AMD's
architected dual core design
do I detect some salt here because the a
modular a modular core design is not the
same thing as taking your single core
product and slapping two dyes onto a
package okay let's carry on
next point architected for the data
center which has nothing to do with
inconsistent supply nothing at all
and poor track record now you can go
after AMD for having a bit of a poor
track record over the last little while
sure I don't think that AMD's supply for
Opteron has been the problem I just
don't think anyone's wanted it for a
while so basically Intel is taking
irrelevant unrelated points and saying
and we're architected for the data
center which has nothing to do with
those other things we said also Naples
is super architected for the data center
ok AMD epic may have a silly game rename
and it does yeah but that changes
nothing about the way that Infinity
fabric and the way that they built this
architecture for mondo PCI Express Lanes
which is super a big deal for the data
center right now that has nothing to do
with the way that this product was
designed for massive amounts of memory
and massive numbers of connected devices
via PCI Express okay
carrying on robust software and hardware
yeah we're going after that again we're
going after the ecosystem lack of
ecosystem they have no ecosystem at all
not at all this you can't you can buy
the chip you can't put it in anything
and you know software for it there's no
compatible hardware here's the problem
with this hard sales pitch in this deck
right now if Intel had come out and said
look we've got a more mature ecosystem
that's way more reasonable we've been
supporting the data center for the last
five years in a way that a and B has
just been completely out of the game for
we understand our customers better than
AMD coming in as practically an outsider
within a position to do right now you
know what the weird I have gone okay the
people who hate Intel are going to hate
this because they just find something to
hate in anything that intel does but I
can accept that this slide I cannot
accept this slide specifically feels
like some person you know how you know
how everyone's well you'll see like
intel slides and it's obviously not a
real Intel quad it feels like some
random dude on YouTube was like I have
memes Intel's attacking AMD but I'm just
like through this slide together in five
minutes this is dank negatives
absolution is dank means level yeah and
the show not even over like the shows
not over there's but wait there's more
oh look at these look at these arrows
good bad this is like a lesson in how to
not do PowerPoint it's like the
clickbait version of business marketing
right fully integrated all capital
letters bigger old girl here's V ons oh
oh by the way hold on a second okay yet
here's the way that all the cash
communicates and we're just kind of
ignoring right now the way that all
these cores are interconnected because
in some okay now I'm not the the uber
architect surely you know yes I
understand I'm intentionally speaking in
an non grammatically correct fashion
right now because CPU low-level see keep
CPU architecture is not a strong point
for me I do lean on more technical
people like dr. coutras over at uh non
tech to explain the step to me sometimes
but to represent your CPU architecture
as fully integrated as though there
aren't internal interconnects and
internal bottlenecks on a many core
Intel Xeon is not a fair representation
of exactly how that works and they're
saying here single die implementation
maximizes performance and in some cases
that may
affect performance positively compared
to AMD's approach but to call andes
approach which by the way these coherent
links matter and the way that every set
of Zen core so there's eight per module
here the way that every set of n course
has a coherent link against every single
other one yeah free king matters notice
the cross links in the middle that
matters and they drop the glued together
again glued together is not a fair
representation of what AMD is doing over
there unbelievable
rough so it kind of it kind of actually
goes on and on but I feel like we spent
a long time on this topic and the point
is this is beneath Intel this is not an
appropriate dignified way for them to
respond they don't have to like even if
they like we've seen this before it's
not like AMD has never blindsided Intel
with an architectural II and price to
performance superior product Athlon 64
and first-generation Opteron came in and
kicked ass in a way that Zen actually
doesn't like Zen is competitive but not
as crazy is like yeah yeah but it's not
like AMD came out of absolutely nowhere
and took the performance crown and even
when AMD had the performance crown it
took a long time outside of the
enthusiast space and the and actually I
mean on server it it kind of went better
than on the desktop but it took a long
time for AMD to clawback significant
enough market share that Intel couldn't
launch Core 2 Duo
and basically crap all over everything
AMD had achieved in a very short period
of time from a business standpoint not
from an industry disruption and moving
all of us forward standpoint I mean they
brought us sixty four-bit on the desktop
so the fact that Intel is is reacting in
this knee-jerk undignified fashion
it doesn't make business sense it
doesn't make company image sense it
might not even make legal sense yeah
that's a little rough that's a de glued
together part is like specifically an
issue so basically come on guys so about
that time oh yeah great
speaking of sup you know what sup uh-oh
oh cool we haven't done a comic bento
spot or a long time oh yeah we have oh
you did one correct oh all right well
whatever it'll be fun for me yes so
comic a bento is your original comic
book subscription box with at least a
fifty dollar value in each box every box
comes with four to five graphic novels
and it's 25 bucks a month or less
depending on your plan selection there
are monthly themes and this one is
old-school it's pretty cool there's
there's Avengers for I'm not going to go
into why are you ruining what I'm about
to unbox did you just do
did you just do what I thought you did
there's not avengers definitely editor
right it's the top one on the box of
course it is that's okay because that
means you can't foil that much of a
surprise for me yeah yeah
I have been pretty obvious comes with a
cardboard backing so your precious
graphic novels will not be bent
unnecessarily alright cool
a classic feeling team updated for a
modern reading experience wow it's
actually really nicely printed yeah they
often are
who else we got in here captain victory
I have to confess turn I am freaking not
familiar with captain victory neither
minds ok cool
next up we've got sovereign one thing
that I do like about these as they often
try to come in with one that you
recognize right and then filter in some
other ones that look super cool but you
might not know about right you're like a
super hardcore comic fan and that yield
you'd never like I mean okay perfect
example of sort of getting drawn into
something that might not have a great
cover this has a great cover though
cinderella serial-killer princess how
can i like i'm going to read this after
the show
apparently i'll be great as for the
cinderella one specifically I was
reading this serial killer princess
critically acclaimed reinvention of
Cinderella this book is for fans of
Deadpool and Harley Quinn s comics which
if you look at the front and the art
style with Mike her heel and stuff that
totally makes sense
and takes revenge violence to a whole
new level fun so perfect example of this
is that I was stuck with absolutely
nothing to do at my uncle's house and
the only thing on his shelf that wasn't
like Russian poetry or something was
bone are you familiar bone no okay
that's a graphic novel it looks like
this thick for all them you should
borrow it sometimes it was great it's
something that I wouldn't have looked at
unless somebody put it in front of me
and said well you have nothing else to
do right now so you're going to have to
read this or do nothing or if I paid for
it already so damn it I better try it
yes yeah I'm yeah so cool so you can
sign up using code ltte to get seven
bucks off comic denta today over at
comic bento com also sponsoring the show
today is freshbooks slash LTX so if
you're a small business owner or a
freelancer and you're looking for a
super simple accounting tool FreshBooks
has got you covered and like honestly I
could go on and on about it forever
there's the fact that you can it's all
cloud-based so you can do it on your
desktop or your laptop or you can have
the full functionality fresh books on
your mobile device you can track your
expenses you can fill your clients you
can see when they've seen your invoices
etc etc etc but the point is if you want
to save time and make more money by
doing work instead of documenting your
work and billing for your work
FreshBooks is the way to go and they
have graciously agreed to sponsor LTX
2017 which is coming up very soon July
29th we've got literally a trailer load
worth of swag over in the other have you
seen the swag pile no it's it's frickin
sick crystals oh ah you can you can do
whatever is required at the show to get
swag everybody else that's actually way
more into getting kind of totally that
swag we've got activities we are going
to have some very very special builds
there so the plan the plan is to have
the arcade build there yeah the ultimate
DIY arcade yeah the plan is to resurrect
mineral oil PC yeah the plan is to have
a one of a kind
wall pewter there you know about that
project no actually yes yes yes and
there is a really special project I'm
all I'm going to say is it involves
about 200 pounds worth of monitors and
monitor mounting hardware
it's like genuinely really really cool
and it'll be there and you'll see cooler
than the one that I saw down in Silicon
Valley cool like straight up so try out
fresh books head to fresh book stock
home slash win and enter when and how
did you hear about that section they got
a free trial there and finally I fix it
if you're familiar with iFixit and you
probably are if you've ever tried to
replace a battery in a sealed device or
almost anything replace the screen or
upgraded an iMac because those things
are actually not easy to open up unless
you've got all the equipment you need
from iFixit so they've got professional
guides and they've also got a fantastic
lineup of great high quality tools and
this
one right here the protec toolkit is now
only 5995 it includes the 64 bit driver
kit with all the bits that we need for
just about any DIY electronics repair
it's got an anti-static strap it's got
their suction cups it's got their prying
tools it's got their ESD safe tweezers
and oh yeah I've already spoiled the
punchline it's only 59.99 now so head
over to ifixit.com slash Linus and pick
up yours you can often buy yourself and
iFixit tech tool kit and for an hour or
two of your time you can basically have
your tool kit covered with the money
that you would have spent paying
somebody else to do a very basic repair
honestly one of my favorite about it is
before this I had like a few different
screwdrivers yep and like they did
different screwdrivers would have
different size bits with them and stuff
yeah and now I just grab one thing and
you'd always be running around looking
for that one yeah alright so this was
posted originally by Valentine on the
forum and non-tech is the original
article here we've got a lot more
details about thread Ripper as well as
Rison 3 so the thread Ripper 1920 X and
1950 X are going to be 12 and 16 core
processors they are freaking huge that
is a real human hand for scale and
they're going to cost $7.99 and 999 AMD
has basically come right in and said
nope this stuff doesn't cause them dot
PNG the pricing for loud skylake x is
now looking a little bit out of whack I
mean it remains to be seen exactly how
well they perform but we know clock
speeds the 1950 X will apparently have a
base clock of 3.4 gigahertz and a boost
of 4 gigahertz wow that is not freaking
bad on that many threads it's got a gdp
of a hundred and eighty watts that's fun
though but you care if Rison is anything
to go by it looks like we might get a
proper Tim so a proper thermal interface
material which will help to do
to paint that heat and because it is
such a large I don't want to say chip
because that doesn't matter because the
overall die area under the spreader is
so large we're going to see coolers that
are optimized to have heat pipes across
as many of those processing cores as
possible and it should be potentially
easier to manage also assuming that AMD
doesn't rush the ecosystem too much
hopefully we won't run into any problems
with the boards but all of that remains
to be seen and you know combined with
combined with Intel's boson X 299 right
now is further validation for all the
people criticizing me for moving our
editors over to X 99 shortly before the
X 299 launch yeah that's why I do it
because in much like a net it has
nothing to do with bias it's not AMD
Intel Nvidia I don't give a crap if it's
mission-critical I am not running no one
to then old then you have all the BIOS
updates you have tons of different
chipset updates you have so much and I
might run it if it's one machine yeah
I'm not going to go and invest an entire
workstation change out in something that
maybe it's good or maybe I'm going to
find out that that board that I put in
there has some phylogeny recalled or
whatever when that would be thoroughly
covered on forums everywhere by that
time I start buying a year old board
that's right I can just buy something
that's based on that it's like the
stasek elisa same board is what we
running on our test benches for the last
you know year and a half
speaking of things you can do with this
though are you going to go back to X
gamers one CPU um not with thread Ripper
probably okay ah but if we can get
something going with epoch okay I would
love to do something very interesting
with epoch and you can even be like
genuinely one this time actually yeah
yeah yeah we could because a lot of
people roasted Linus because it had two
CPUs in it it was supposed to be a play
on two girls one cup I know
it was supposed to be here but I'm
saying I'm cop either way I don't really
mind that a Marriott barrel
I thought the joke was funny I thought
the joke was funny everything's cool I'm
just saying you could actually do it
this time he is kind of a suck-up isn't
he John was right Oh get out of here I
don't care it'll watch it anymore I hope
the show by myself I'm killing the frame
I can just talk louder for day Wow all
right next topic sky like ex mess
explore it I guess is my muck my turn to
throw it throw it Intel jeez that's kind
of a rough day Hey
so far sky like X has been plagued by
two main issues at its stock settings it
can barely be cooled all your things in
the way oh no sorry but during normal
operation this is due to its power
consumption being extremely high in some
situations we also found that the mmm
there's a huge cooling issue with the
board but oh yeah they are MV r MZ RM
said a huge cooling issue that was a
couple weeks ago yeah there's barely any
room for enthusiasts to overclock also
many motherboards limit sky like X CPUs
further due to poor design choices like
I just mentioned such as insufficient
vrm cooling so this may be this may be
the dawn of the motherboard full cover
block oh hey so that's like that's been
a thing yeah
but it's never really made sense because
so going back going back to like the
early 2000s it was pretty commonplace
from other boards to have little whiny
dying fans on them yeah and then right
around the time of like I guess enforce
n43 or and force for what what was the a
a 1030 to SLI deluxe deluxe I can't
remember what chipset that was I want to
say enforce for okay so that's an a 1030
to SLI deluxe terrible image but you get
the point so we did away with noisy
Northbridge and Southbridge coolers
because they have to keep it low profile
because you can install cards here right
those sli existed at the time
and we did away with that and we move
towards this heat pipes that lie flat on
the board and carry all the heat up
around the CPU socket area with the
assumption that either you're going to
have an air cooler sitting on your CPU
that's going to generate enough passive
airflow to deal with the VRMs here and
here as well as the heat from the
Southbridge in the Northbridge which end
up here so that paradigm has lasted us
pretty much until now we might be
returning to active cooling on VRMs if
there's no other way to deal with this
and honestly what this kind of looks
like to me is like intel has said that
like hey that we have a plan for the
rollout of core I 9 so we're going to do
this here this here and it has to do
with CPU yield a suit that honestly I
wonder if part of it has to do with that
they just like actually on the
engineering side have no idea how
they're going to launch this yeah I just
kind of buy some I should see it this
will be interesting because it's me
pretty much the first time ever that I
will see a motherboard full cover block
and be like yeah good call that makes
sense yeah yeah cuz in the past it
looked really cool yeah but it's been
like oh okay that's an excessively
expensive PC probably because of a
showcase and it probably makes no sense
in terms of actually anyone ever doing
this but it looks cool for whatever
brand wanted to show it off like sure
why not but that'll be pretty cool now
be interesting having people like
actually ask questions about full cover
clocks I know right um all right what
else you got first I discussed I just
have to pause the show for a second ah
Timmy Val one two three in the twitch
chat just head in all capital letters I
just want to make sure that I react to
this I have a boyfriend I just wanted to
make sure it's apparently extremely
important that you have one no or that
Timmy does so Timmy goes hey you know
what Timmy Congrats okay good job all
right Facebook plans to unveil a
200-dollar now we've heard that before
yeah Wow Wireless that's new oculus VR
headset in 2018 the whole twitch that's
like congrats to me oh man
yeah I mean that's cool I don't name
Pacific if anyone's looking to buy an
oculus rift it's designed and this is
going to terrify you to bridge the gap
between cheap smartphone mounted VR
headsets and high-end gaming ones oh it
does not need to be tethered to a PC or
a phone it will ship next year and
represent an entirely new category the
device hold on just hold it in for now
the device resembles a more compact
version of the rift and will be lighter
than Samsung's gear VR headset the idea
is that someone will be able to pull the
headset out of their bag and watch
movies on a flight just the way you can
now with a phone or tablet old it in the
new headset will have a similar
interface to a gear VR and can be
controlled via wireless remote
they plan to power the products with a
Snapdragon mobile chip from Qualcomm and
it's gaming power will be superior to
that of the gear VR but unlike the
powerful rift device and it will not
include positional tracking technology
but if it isn't
they plan to begin briefing content
makers on the device by October and it
will have a download store though the
downloads will be rewritten and
accessible from a virtual reality
interface
and
and go so they gave up like this is that
it is that all that s to say oculus just
gave up there's like at screw it we are
done we're out of here we have lots of
Facebook money that's fine no one's
buying headsets because they're
overpriced and not very good right now
so just going to stop developing those
and we'll just make a phone that's built
into the headsets you can't take the
phone out and there you go you could
just buy this one that you can just slip
this device that you've literally always
eff and carry on you in the front of it
and it'll just work and that would be
totally fine and it doesn't cost that
much but no it's going to be ever so
slightly faster and you can watch movies
on the plane Wow you can't already do
that on your phone or like this screen
that's built into the freaking chair in
front of you it's going to suck word
that I'm not going to say in terms of
performance that's a huge issue right
now VR applications for desktop your
desktop computer is usually not fast
enough to run really really high
fidelity really really high quality
games it's a little bit of an issue it's
a little bit hard to do it's possible
but it's difficult and then the headsets
that you have right now for desktop
tethered like devise and the current
rift don't have good enough screens
don't have good enough a lot of other
kind of stuff to be at the minimum
quality that consumers expect and
they're way too freakin expensive to
release a dedicated $200 device which no
one's going to really want to buy
because they can just slip their thing
into a daydream or whatever which should
be a lot cheaper and probably will be
now that this lunch is not remember that
stuff like this already has existed I
literally carry different I was
literally the product manager for view 6
back at NCIX Sony has one yeah like Sony
professionally has a movie Viewer
designed other things are you ready to
chill out a little bit because I
withheld one key piece of information oh
my god I'm like very angry and
disappointed but Facebook has also said
it's working on a prototype device named
Santa Cruz that is basically a wireless
rift with the full power of the original
device sans PC actually that's not going
to make you any less mad probably sans
PC no bliss out a PC wait what
okay sorry I thought they were just
talking about wireless rift I didn't
read the last two words okay I don't
understand how that makes anything I
didn't see so basically you need a
backpacker so basically it's it's a porn
device now yes and you can watch porn on
a plane they gave up like I've mentioned
on like to wine shows recently I've
gotten some flack for it but it is a
thing it's not all of the posts but
there's a notably increased amount
compared to quite a few months back if
you go to like the oculus subreddit of
posts that are just about porn and you
know what you want to look at porn on
your device go for it I don't care I
don't give a crap at all but what these
things are really supposed to be doing
in the long run is like really really
interesting entertainment mediums not
watching movies and playing I'm talking
about like a virtual big look what
picture this oh god virtual big screen
just kill them a little bit inside I
think everyone hold on
get this simulated theater experience
it's so bad it's so bad
I don't missed it it's so bad oh but
there's such interesting experiences
that you can do in such interesting
experiences you can have if you come to
LTX
I'll try to show you some of them
there's specific survey Ochs
is a specific vr game development
company that is making very good and
very interesting things
raw data and I don't run the name of
their new one but it's a running one and
asked Racing and it's actually really
cool you race against each other and you
can like you have to run around but it's
kind of like skis
I finally got Arizona sunshine Arizona
sunshine is pretty cool
there's Robo recalls like amazing like
there's really really good experiences
that you can have but the device is
supposed to be a different price than it
was by a lot because there's a huge cost
in the computer already there's way too
expensive piss off this was really fun
okay why don't we talk about something a
little lighter well it's a little heavy
the KFC phone it's the only thing about
KFC that could be light at all this
might makes more sense than that stupid
things were always special edition' KFC
smartphone for China so what
sorry some of the chat just said man
cares too much I do I really want VR to
work and I just I feel I didn't I feel
like they're just doing like clearly the
wrong they'll make it work it's just
going to be like kind of lame mainstream
VR for like a long time a long time and
like that gap I was talking to that was
at Rubio Jeff Rubio I could have the
name wrong but the guy from Naughty Dog
then I works for oculus and he gave a
timeline and I was like you know what
that makes sense and I think it was
something about something around three
years when I had that meeting yeah and
you can line up that meeting because
that lined up with a counter-strike
tournament where I made a video about
watching the counter-strike tournament
was divided right I don't think that's
going to happen anymore
so in other news it's to celebrate KFC's
30th anniversary within the country of
China okay
the KFC edition of the hallway enjoy
seven-plus was unveiled by the
restaurant chain via its official Weibo
page in addition to a snazzy red finish
and a picture of the colonel on the back
of the device the smartphone comes
preloaded with the K music app which
allows you to play music over the
speaker system installed in KFC
restaurant worse which definitely
wouldn't get annoying really really
really fast for everybody else and won't
be eliminated entirely almost
immediately only 5,000 probably slightly
produced pre-approved music that you can
put through I guess so and there are
other weird KFC things so oh no no mine
these are just other weird KFC things
they had a takeout box that apparently
doubled as a smartphone charger and a
facial recognition scanner in
conjunction with search giant Baidu they
do whatever to help offer meal
suggestions oh boy
like they say well I guess it just looks
for how many Chin's you have and decides
how many pieces of chicken you need like
is that how that would work or how
difficult it because you like machine
learning to like analyze faces how would
actually be fascinating if you could go
accurate it would be if you could try
out your out areas because we can't see
unlike some where okay so let's take it
a and W actually aim W in the state
actually very different from up here oh
yeah this non-us might make any sense
but let's take a NW you can be like a
Mozza burger person or you can be a teen
burger person and there would be nothing
you could know or like a chubby chicken
burger these are all sort of equivalent
ease of food they're both the same but
they taste quite different yeah um
whereas at KFC
there's chicken and there's less chicken
and there's more chicken with a bucket
of chicken yeah there's like a little
tiny box or a small boxes but bucket of
chicken yeah like yeah or a trough of
chicken like it's all about chicken I
would be curious to know if you could
just enter like a picture of yourself
and like of your house and of yours and
entered your BMI if it could tell you
what you were planning to order at KFC
that would be a very interesting study
um Justin like in like how humans do
thing in like psychology there just be a
very very interesting study I would read
it okay
ah the 1+5 display is upside down so
this was posted by a nerd slayer on the
forum oops
confirmed the jelly scrolling effect
which honestly I didn't even notice it
is amazing the kinds of things like like
a clip vault it's stupid because like
I'll be able to tell the difference
between like 72 and 60 Hertz on a
display yeah if I'm playing a game or
something and it will be like who cares
whereas like I look at like a phone and
I'm like but there's a slight kind of
rebounding effect when you scroll and
they're calling it the the jelly jelly
scrolling effect or something like that
and apparently it is caused by 1 +
moving the motherboard and hence
flipping the display panel in order to
accommodate their new dual lens camera
module so they consciously rearrange the
internals and then are using a normally
only used for Diagnostics but they
actually use this so they used a field
that you can exist in Android where you
can hold
to display 180 degrees yeah
in order to account for this
rearrangement so we're and so what users
did was they manually changed other
devices to be upside-down and the jelly
scrolling effect appeared on them now
what I'd like to know because obviously
if you hold it display like this that
doesn't have an upside-down display
installation go like this or you hold it
like this and go like this it doesn't
matter so what I want to know is if this
is just a matter of a simple
optimization yeah that could be done in
software like it would be so we'll we'll
see we'll see the Google pixel to design
was leaked this is posted by mr. Chau
one nine nine one zero three one nine on
the forum and the original article here
is from Android police apparently it
will be made by LG this time rather than
HTC and this is apparently the pixel XL
with a low bezel AMOLED display and a
squeezable frame so HTC won't be the
only one with a squeezable frame neat I
guess that's cool it's one of those
things that like I've never really asked
for why do you want to but what's the
benefit how'd it do stuff okay yeah um
six inch AMOLED display with round
corners glass window on the back is
smaller this time fingerprint readers no
longer inside of it but below it no
visible antenna bands
it's believed it will have a squeezable
frame okay so that's pretty much all we
know none of that sounds super important
to me um there's things that I care a
lot more about on pixel 2 than any of
that information so I think we ought to
wait Logitech is on a roll here on
acquisitions this is supposed to buy a
Dyson on the forum the original article
hears from CNET apparently or I could
just use the press release that they
sent me I don't play no so there won't
be like a gaming headset industry
eventually because it'll just be
logitech and razer and razer that's fair
who else exists
turtlebeach is sort of still kicking
around like on the console side I think
okay I don't understand quite how but I
didn't understand why Astro had a right
to exist either I mean to be clear
apparently the a40 is great the only one
I ever reviewed was the a 50 and it was
terrible I never had a good experience
with them it was an abominable value and
that was compared to wireless headphones
that are headsets that existed back then
and to my knowledge I don't think
they've updated it so they bought
ultimate ears they bought jaybird they
acquired SciTech I've been doing great
things I haven't seen what they've done
with SciTech yet have they released
anything I don't know if they've done
much with SciTech but basically Logitech
kind of went well we're an engineering
company we're just going to embrace that
and screw it we're just going to buy
brand it's been working so far the
ultimate ears want especially I'm
interested to see what they do with site
X I'd love that kind of stuff but yeah
yeah meanwhile razer is running around
buying thx and phone maker next bit so
apparently the deal will close in early
August and yeah basically I didn't even
read any of Logitech statements about it
because this is fairly transparent yeah
Logitech couldn't figure out why the
hell anyone was using Astro gaming
headsets which is vow'd so they went
okay well I don't want to deal with this
anymore and bought them which is valid
yeah so we love the Astro gaming
branding especially from way back in the
day was really thick like I remember
they had at PAX they were giving away an
Astra gaming shirt and it was like by
far the coolest one at the event and
like they had a really cool booth and
they partnered with really cool people
so I could understand how it's like
you're just woah fully ignorant in terms
of headset and you're like I went to
this cool event and they had cool stuff
I'm going to tell my friends and we're
all gonna buy them you know I mean
especially before like reviews on that
kind of stuff with some piping and
really accessible
lately though I don't know how they're
still around I don't know man
apparently this is great so apparently
Logitech is taking it and if it ain't
broke don't fix it approach here and the
Astro and Logitech G brands will keep
separate teams and basically they're
saying we don't just want to jam a new
product down your throats every year
just because we can so that's the nice
way of saying if you guys like this
trash then we'll just keep making it for
you I guess as far as I can tell whoa
because there's no doubt that logitech's
engineering knows a lot more about
engineering than Astros engineering
Astro might be able to help to make it
so the headsets don't fall people's
heads okay that's fair that would be
good that's their 100 update there yeah
that's fair yeah but then logitech also
could have just like gone and bought a
hyper x cloud and disassembled it if
they wanted to understand how that works
yeah all right so on that know thank you
for watching the land show we will see
you guys again next week same bat-time
same bat-channel do you want to do a
short after party stream we can okay do
it yeah buh-buh-buh-buh-byeeeee
people are calling me line of flames it
Wow why I have never been called
something that offensive in my life
look at this how does he do this like
how do you screw this out undo your
thing in the world would be to use this
well this one's see this one's right
sort of except to say well why does they
change
I don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
