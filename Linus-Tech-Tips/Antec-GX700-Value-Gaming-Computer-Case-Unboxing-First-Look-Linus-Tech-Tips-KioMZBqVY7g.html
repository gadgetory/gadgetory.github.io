the antic GX 700 now you might have
noticed that this box is an antique 900
box so we actually got our sample sent
before the GX 700 had a proper retail
box or something like that so that's why
we don't have a GX 700 box but we have
some box to open so we're not gonna
worry too much about that you know being
all butthurt about not having the right
box and we do have the right case inside
so everything is is okay oh wait no okay
I see what they've done here they do
have a box for the GX 700 but it is
actually inside a 900 box or something
and we're just gonna have to be creative
about this and open it up because there
we go go away 900 blocks
Hulk rip my thumb that hurts a lot now
there we go
it's sort of like a birthing process one
case born of another case that is not
actually related to it in any way which
is like a divine miracle of so okay you
know what moving right along to the GX
700 which we do have a box for and we
are going to start unboxing we should
just restart the video here because this
is ridiculous
there we go so this is aimed to be the
every gamer case it has the features
that people want so it has things like
top mounted radiator support dual 120
there's a piece of foam that will
apparently do something right there
okay hard foam on the outside this is a
value oriented case although when you do
see the feature list I know that we saw
this case in the antec suite at CES and
we all guessed higher numbers for the
MSRP than it actually is
ouch this is a reviewers guide so Cadman
briefed on this already okay
so that's why you're gonna see hard
phone included it's not that heavy so
hopefully it's not going to cause any
problems in shipping but one place where
I would kind of pause oh the one thing
that would give me pause it would be
shipping a fully loaded GX 700 in the
stock box I don't know how comfortable
I'd be with that because the additional
weight of the components inside does add
additional weight so let's start with
the front panel front panel is pretty
straightforward this you've got four or
five and a quarter inch bays the way
these clip in is actually kind of cool
there you go hold on you're gonna notice
something here that's because these
front covers are actually made of metal
on this case it's been a long time since
I've seen like a custom custom metal
front panel on a okay I'm just going to
give away the surprise on a $69 case so
very cool and there's some functionality
to the clips they actually clip this in
place this piece is plastic here this
piece is plastic here so you're not
gonna have to worry about scratching the
paint off of it because it's colored
plastic and then these parts are metal
right here power button reset switch
hard drive and power LEDs and then this
is cool as well so there's four thumb
screws here this is a dog tag e style
chunk of metal as well right here that
just says GX 700 and Antec you can
actually take it off if you really
wanted to there's it's just folded over
the back so it's not really uh it's not
really that difficult to remove and put
something else on there and then this
piece right here is actually metal as
well so this is just a cover for
hopefully I can yeah there we go this is
just a cover for there you go a
removable fan filter so you can pop that
out clean it pop it back in presumably
because you want your computer to be
clean and then you can go ahead and
thread these thread these guys back in
here I wish it was a little bit easier
to get up but I do like the aesthetic of
the whole sort of you know thumbscrews
thing with the rugged looking sort of
case front i/o this is where this is
where the aesthetic sort of gets away
from me a little bit because the front
is very obviously sort of a green and
black theme
whereas the top is mostly black but then
it's actually got green on the front i/o
so you can see 2 USB 3 2 USB 2
microphone headphone and this is kind of
cool actually this one I like here's the
fan speed controller low medium and high
it has 3 switches for the integrated
controller I just I wish that this was
green or something like that so that it
looked more like black with green
accents right now it's just sort of
black and then you've got a little bit
of green you could fix that up by
putting like some spray painted green
fans under here or something like that
then it would actually look pretty too
so let's go ahead and have a look at the
side which is black and the other side
which is also black you've got a 120
millimeter fan mount here those fan
mounts on the top we're 120 / 140 so you
could do either 120 or 140 mm fan 7
expansion slots that's pretty standard
bottom mounted power supply and then
you've got kind of a thing going on here
forget how this works you do gugu thank
you push it here and then it should yeah
there we go so that gives you access to
all the thumb screws back there so you
just kind of Oh hold on switch to the
wrong thing there we go are we good is
that the right thing ah ah what's going
on there we go okay good some reason
it's really really dark well back there
we go we got that pic sorry about that
guys it's a black case and it's a black
table and then there's a button right
here that you press to get access to the
thumbscrews so that you can to lessly
put in PCI cards or whatever else you
want also I made a mistake on the price
point before as was pointed out by both
diesel and slick who told me that it's
actually 59 so it's a $60 case and
there's a 120mm fan in the back so it's
got three fans included which is already
if you you know by fans they do cost
money so that's already something like a
you know at least $20 value depending
what kind of fans you're buying so there
you go side panel yeah it has some flex
to it however it does have
reinforcements here here and here in the
typical sort of an tech fashion so you
always know something built by an tech
is going to be well built it's not just
going to be sort of like
flimsy piece of metal attached to
another flimsy piece of metal
interior-wise we see the layout of this
case really start to shine here so
you've got the staple Antec three and a
half inch drive cages they're actually
accessible from the other side panel on
this particular case so I'm going to
take off the thumb screws at the back
here and show you how they slide out
from the other side there we go other
side panel is identical to the first one
except that it doesn't have the 120
millimeter fan mount here we go
instructions pull them out here so once
you put a hard drive in lay in these
they will stiffen up significantly and
you can see it's got little little dots
in here so those will go into the hard
drives they are completely toolless I
kind of wish they'd give you the option
to screw them in you can see there are
no holes in the side here you can also
easily mount a two and a half inch drive
on here by using the holes that are in
the bottom so you've got five hard drive
sleds right there and then since we're
at the back anyway you can also see the
tool-less mechanism for the five and a
quarter inch base this is just operated
by twisting pulling off putting back on
and then locking back into place again
and the five and a quarter inch bays do
give you the option to screw in the
drives a large cpu cut out this is
something that's become a bit of a
standard feature now as well as cable
management loops so you can see one two
three cable management loops here on the
back of the motherboard tray that allows
you to keep the cables flat which makes
it easier to put the back side panel on
I wouldn't have minded seeing a little
bit more room for cable management back
here so I think you're gonna have
trouble running a 24 pin up the side
here however you can see they did leave
space here where it goes in to run a 24
pin so there's lots of room for an 8 pin
enough room for a 24 pin next to the
mother okay well that's what they
intended okay nevermind we don't need
more space so 24 pin goes here and all
is well in my world from the front of
the case there's not a whole lot you can
see that you couldn't see from the back
to be perfectly honest there's your
power supply mount so you do have a
filtered there we go intake here at the
bottom show you guys that you can pull
that out replace it no big deal you've
got four little dots that will hold the
power supply slightly off the bottom of
the case
and then you've also got like I said
before rear-mounted power supply this
holds it in cable management goes here
and then up the sides here so you're
able to bring them out for the optical
days for graphics cards and then here
for the 24 pin for the CPU I did say
before that there was room for 120
millimeter dual 120 millimeter liquid
cooler in the top so you would be able
to do that there's 140 ml fans there now
but the mounting holes are included for
120 and then you do have enough space
you can see the top of the motherboard
will be about here so there's exactly
enough space for a rad there and then if
you wanted you could also add another
120 millimeter fan here and it looks
like there would be enough space that
you wouldn't have any interference there
which is actually quite cool so thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the GX 700 don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and slickin diesel also corrected
me on another thing that I was wrong
about so the fan speed controller here
is actually off low and high not low
medium and high
so yeah sorry my dad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
