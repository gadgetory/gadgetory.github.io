table I'm pretending to put these in-ear
earbuds with a built in mp3 player into
my ear I'm not actually gonna do it cuz
I don't know who's actually put these in
their ears but there's a little there's
a little switch where did I lose it
basically these are meant to be an mp3
player that you actually just attach
right to your ears you use the little
wheel on here to change the song and to
play and pause your volume controls
right here and you load it with a USB
Drive we are with a USB cable right here
so that's actually a pretty neat little
little product we've got we've also got
a few other ones here so I'm gonna start
with the noise cancelling ones these are
the smaller less impressive noise
cancelling ones you can see there's a
little external battery pack right here
so that powers your noise-cancelling
you've also got a power switch so you
can turn on presumably the noise
cancelling so I'm just gonna model these
for you I guarantee the wow I can't hear
a thing so you can see they've got a
plethora lining just around your ear and
then a mesh inside so that's how the
sound gets through to your ear that's
how the other sound does not get through
to your ear alright then we have a
larger version of that so these have a
bigger driver for better bass response
they've also got a slightly more
comfortable looking earcup design you
can see it's actually rotatable
completely the wrong way although I'm
sure there's a way to fix that that I'm
not gonna try and figure out on camera
because this would not work very well
but um yeah okay presumably you can fix
it ah yes like this look I was trying to
twist it around but this is what I
needed to do ah look at that that's Sony
innovation for you alright so we just go
like that once again i cannot hear much
from my surroundings but presumably they
would sound really good i don't actually
have an mp3 player here unfortunately
and these are pretty much the cat's
pajamas they're bright pink you know
that it's got to be good when oh there's
a key yeah thanks cameraman there's
apparently an mp3 player here you know
when you can get away with releasing
bright pink headphones that look like
this they've got a sound really good
because that's how you are going to sell
a lot of and Sony's pretty good at
producing products and sell an awful lot
so there we are it's cleverly labeled
left and right so you can make sure you
don't put them on wrong and they've got
kind of a little
chromed pink logo up at the top here and
what looks like kind of a splashed paint
kind of design on them I really like
these personally but um I'm not i mean i
might not be the only person but a lot
of people might not they come with a
tangle proof court and you can actually
see up here that it is detachable but it
has a little anchor so you can actually
keep it in place okay so that gives you
a way to easily replace the tango proof
cord with maybe a different color who
maybe you want to have bright pink
headphones with like a lime green table
thank you cards for you know Sony should
pay me for these ideas because uh I'm
sure they'd sell a whole bunch of lime
green hat on cords and then last but not
though no not last ok no we still have
more to come more to come but these are
great apparently they sound really good
and they also have a tangle proof cord
I'm not gonna say too much more else
about these now four different ones you
talk about all right here we have eBook
readers this one is not touch screen
sorry we left off there this is the
e-book reader that does not have a
touchscreen and this is the one that
does so this one has a stylist it has
mp3 functionality if I could figure out
how to get the stylus Oh that'd be great
there we go it has mp3 functionality you
kit has a built-in dictionary you can
make little annotations and notes oh
this is an actual working model look at
that all the things on the WD table were
just empty plastic shells hoot I gave
our rep a really hard time about so so
yeah look sony actually gives us the
good stuff cool okay so then we have the
yes last but not least this camera i
forget the exact model but it does this
there oh now the dow the straps all wet
so whoever goes to try and do this demo
next time is going to have a wet strap
on the camera pretty cool and then
here's a pen that shows off the panorama
feature that i never did show with that
camera but i should have so you just
take the camera turn it around and it
takes a panorama shot just like that
thank you for checking out my video blog
don't forget to subscribe and this is
the sony table at our sales training oh
yeah there's that mp3 player the
cameraman is making
