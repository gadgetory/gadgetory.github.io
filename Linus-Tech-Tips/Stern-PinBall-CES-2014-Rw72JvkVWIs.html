brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital alright guys i'm here
with gary stern from Stern Pinball inc
and we're checking out a pinball machine
which is not necessarily something I
expected to see when we came to CES but
it's actually pretty awesome I grew up
on pin Paul a little bit and my dad
loves pinball all the time so what
what's special about this machine I know
you brought up LEDs what else is special
about this machine well this this is
obviously it's a Star Trek pinball
machine this is our limited edition
version of it we make games in various
versions three new titles a year we make
a pro for operators and many homeowners
we make a limited edition numbered games
this is one of 799 that will not be 800
and and then we make a premium which has
all the play features of the limited
edition not quite as much eye candy this
game has a few more bells and whistles
as to play features and some more I can
to your artwork now those other tiers
and this year how much would that take
you in the wallet take you in the wallet
that's a good I like that bracelet the
limited edition will sell a little bit
north of eight thousand dollars the pro
the normal game which many operators
used in many home well this is five
thousand dollars plus or minus and the
premium is oh seven thousand dollars
something like that we also make some
games that are not coin up at all don't
have a coin door like this one does and
they are somewhat under three thousand
dollars you'll see some of them at the
show now the price tag might make some
people surprised but there's a lot that
goes into this this isn't exactly like
just building a computer like a lot of
you guys are going to be familiar with
so what goes into building one of these
first of all about a million dollars of
design goes into it a very large stay of
designing the game between playfield
designers software rules designers and
not just programmers and I just code
and artists and mechanical engineers and
what have you as to the content what's
in there material wise there's 3,500
different parts and parts in there okay
there's a hundred to this school and 200
of that but a total of thirty-five
hundred parts over half a mile of wire
printed circuit boards and more man
hours of labor then then was in the ford
taurus when it used to be built not far
from our plant in the Chicagoland area
so its potential that if you buy this it
took longer for this to be made than
your car which is actually pretty
interesting I played for a little while
and it is really fun it's really
interesting how it'll set you up to do
different things and different goals in
the game and I know there's other
pinball machines that do that but I
liked how fluid this one was if you
haven't ever played pinball before which
I know a lot of our viewers will not
have ever played pinball before it's
amazing to me you have to play pinball
is very important it's part of it part
of life you must play pinball and a few
of you that have will have played like
3d pinball back on XP or even some of
the newer pinballs through steam that I
know if you played it's not the same
just like everything you have to operate
it you have to press the buttons on the
side you have to feel the flipper move
you have to nail the ball down on the
column on the right hand side it's very
different it's a it's a ball and bat
game and as Harry Williams a great
pinball designer once said the ball is
wild it's not programmed you know in a
simulated a pinball on video their
program and some of our games are on
farside for example that some of our
games that's very interesting but the
real game is the real game the ball is
wild and with computers things are
prediction it might not be perfect and
random number generators on computers
are never really perfect this is
actually what's happening because of
physics thanks for watching all of our
videos if you want to see all of our
content at CES be sure to tune in and
make sure you subscribe to Linus tech
