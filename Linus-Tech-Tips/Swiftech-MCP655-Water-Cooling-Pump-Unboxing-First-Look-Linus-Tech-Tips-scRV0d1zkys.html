that holds a special place in my heart
this is my personal favorite water
cooling pump this is the Swift AK m CP 6
v 5 so what makes it my favorite water
cooling pump well a couple of different
things first of all in my experience
both as a end user of this product and
as a reseller of this product it is
phenomenally reliable these pumps almost
never die they come with a one-year
warranty but I can tell you with a fair
amount of confidence you pretty much
won't need it
number two the performance is awesome
this is one of the best performing pumps
on the market yes you might be looking
at you know this pump with through this
aftermarket adder that on-paper
outperforms it but the reality of it is
once you have a good high performance
pump that's pushing water through the
blocks you're talking about maybe a half
a degree tops a performance difference
between this and something else that
that outperforms it in a synthetic test
so I really do love this particular
product and I do use one in fact my MCP
6 5 5 is a few years old and still going
strong in my personal water-cooled
machine so what a swift I have to say
for themselves here ultra-quiet ok fair
enough
i buy that no maintenance compact design
and adjustable speed extreme performance
reliability of five years mean time
between failures yea I buy that for sure
quick and easy installation which is
also true and yeah that pretty much
summarizes it doesn't it here's a little
diagram of what the pump looks like on
the inside although you've pretty much
shouldn't need to disassemble it for any
for any reason ok packing let's all it
uses Universal 4-pin molex which is
great so you can plug it into your
system no matter what pump speed is
adjustable from 4800 rpm down to 1,800
rpm now this is key this is the most
silent pump out there on the market that
I would consider reliable there have
been other silent pumps but this one is
the one that won't fail you and there's
no nonsense you're just turning down a
very reliable very high-performance pump
to a lower speed here we go operating
voltage range 12 volts yep that's good
plugs and
relax here are all of the technical
specifications which personally I'm not
going to worry too much about because
when it comes down to is it silent it
performs great and it looks a little
something like this this is I can
actually can't stress enough to silence
there's two versions of this pump
there's the mCP 655 and the mCP 6 v 5b
which stands for basic now the basic
version does not come with the
adjustable rpm to me that makes that
pump not nearly as attractive an option
because I basically just take this I
turned it all the way down to one and it
is dead silent now I've tried I've tried
testing this on my loop has a CPU block
a GPU block radiator reservoir and this
pump and I go okay I'm gonna turn it all
the way up to five I'm gonna turn it all
the way down to one how much of a
temperature difference is there nada
it's not measured by the thermal probe
on my CPA which means it's probably
somewhere in the 0.5 to 1 degree range
like within that margin of error it's
much more silent and it's also a very
convenient feature because when you're
first filling your loop in order to get
air bubbles out it can be very useful to
turn it all the way down to the bottom
then crank it up to the top then turn it
all the way down to the bottom what that
can do is it will alter the flow of the
water through your loop in order to
dislodge air bubbles that might be
trapped in your CPU block or your
radiator so that's gonna mean that that
annoying sound of air being sucked
through the pump that makes like a yeah
that kind of noise can be eliminated
much faster with a new build if you have
a pump that has a variable speed like
this one accessory-wise it comes with a
double-sided sticky mounting pad looks a
little something like that you've got
some noise isolation vibration isolation
dampening foam in between and then two
stickers on either side so you can stick
it down you can also screw it down
that's what these holes here are for
okay so it comes with screws as well as
in a little instruction manual now how
does the pump work nice long molex
connector recommends leaving that if
you're gonna run it anywhere like far
because it's kind of ugly but that's
okay okay molex connector on the end and
then you've got your inlet and your
outlet so this is the inlet for the pump
goes right into I hope you can see in
there I'm not sure if you'll be able to
see can you see okay well it goes into
the pump one way or another and then it
spins inside and then pumped the water
out the top so a couple things when
you're installing a pump that are very
important number one you always want
your pump to be lower because gravity
works then your reservoir so the
reservoir water will feed into the pump
without any effort you also want to make
sure there's no restriction around the
inlet of the pump so if you have a
really tight you bend right before the
inlet that's that if you wanted to limit
the flow rate of your pump by using
tight curves in the tubing or whatever
the case may be
you should limit it at the outlet rather
than at the inlet the inlet should be as
restriction free as possible from the
reservoir okay and that's pretty much it
terms of importance Oh another one never
let your pump run dry ever never let it
run with no water coming into it that's
very very bad never take a pump and you
know you know I don't have my other
water cooling components but I want to
find out if it works and plug it in bad
bad bad bad you will destroy your pump
guarantee okay next this pump includes
half-inch fittings so you can see these
are half-inch barbs and they are not
removable so what that means is in my
case when I want to use 3/8 inch tubing
I have to dip it in boiling water and
then stretch it over the fittings in
order to make it fit now there are
aftermarket pumps for the D file
although I see no particular reason to
use them because once you stretch a
smaller tubing like a 7/16 or a 3/8 inch
tubing over it it will never ever leak I
will personally guarantee that if you
get it all the way over to the end so
