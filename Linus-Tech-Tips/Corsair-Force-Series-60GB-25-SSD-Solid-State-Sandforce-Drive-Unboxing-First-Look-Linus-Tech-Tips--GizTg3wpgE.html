new product to unbox this is a corsair
solid-state drive and as you can see
from the sticker applied at the bottom
of the box it is a 4 series 60 gig drive
so the 4 series very creatively named
because of the sandforce controller that
it uses is a state-of-the-art SSD that
has the fastest reads and writes
available on the market in many common
application than now there's one that is
a little bit faster in some situations
it's a say 23 SSD from crucial but there
have been some firmware issues with that
and it's sort of debatable whether it's
worth the risk or not sound force on the
other hand has proven to be a very
stable platform and so that's what we
are going to be having a look at today
so of course they're includes a couple
of different accessories with their 4
series SSD first of all they have a
two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half inch
drive adapter so this is just it's a
pretty pretty bog standard one can see
how it works here so you've got four
screws to attach the drive to the
adapter here you can see it mounts off
to the side a little bit and then you've
got four screws to mount the drive
adapter which you can that looks like
you can only mount it buy it from the
side so if you have a hard drive
mounting system that requires the holes
on the bottom you won't be able to use
this adapter you might have to get a
different one but yeah you've got the
all of the screws included that you need
anyway what's so special about the 4
Series drives is that along with the new
sound force controller comes a couple of
cool features first thing to notice is
that this is a 60 gig drive the original
sound force drives were in 50 100 and
200 gigabyte capacities but what has
been done with the latest firmware is
it's been improved to 60 120 and 240 gig
capacities because they're using
slightly less spare area now spare area
gives you a little bit of extra space to
tweak performance but some companies
were able to find ways to tweak the
performance of the drive free up some
spare area and still get the same
performance out of a 60 as you could out
of a 50 and out of a 120 as you cut out
of 8 100 gig drive so of course there
has kind of a neat finish to their
drives you can see this
is sort of just a plane a plane sort of
matte finish whereas the top is actually
got like a nice brushed finish to it so
if you're mounting this drive somewhere
where you're going to be able to see it
you'll definitely appreciate the little
touches like that that make it look
nicer now cool thing about the 4 Series
drives again is the sequential reads and
sequential writes as well as the random
read and random write performance now
this 4 series drive can actually write
at up to 275 megabytes per second
sequentially it can read it up to two
hundred eighty five megabytes per second
sequentially now used to be when we only
have drives like the ocz vertex this is
a gen one vertex but used mlc flash now
mlc flash means that it can actually
store two bits of data where slc single
slc flash can store only one bit so mlc
is obviously much cheaper because you
get double the capacity that you would
have out of each flash cell that you
have to manufacture so mlc flash
inherently cannot write as fast as slc
flash the reason I keep holding this
drive up is this as an intel x25 ii 32
gig drive this uses slc flash and what
happens is slc can be written to much
much faster but the 4 series controller
actually uses special algorithms to
compress the data as you're writing it
to allow it to write 285 get our rather
275 Meg's but actually it's only writing
less data to the dried because it's
compressing it and then decompressing it
whenever you're reading it on the fly so
it does make for a more complicated more
expensive controller but you save money
because instead of spending four times
the amount on slc flash or and while
four times by the time it hits a shelf
that only costs double but rather than
spending so much more on the flash
you're spending more on the controller
which is relatively minor so thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the
Corsair 4 series f60 SSD and hopefully
you stay tuned I'm going to be doing
something on my NCIX tech tips channel
with this drive so don't forget to
