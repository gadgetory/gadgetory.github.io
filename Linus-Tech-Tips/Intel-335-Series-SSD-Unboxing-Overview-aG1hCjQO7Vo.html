the Intel 335 series SSD now this isn't
really new by any stretch of the
imagination and honestly it's not really
that different from a consumer
standpoint from the 330 series so it's a
sad forest drive just like the 520
series and just like the 330 series so
that's the controller inside it uses
Intel NAND just like every drive from
Intel does and one of the advantages
that intel has a Zayn and technology
developer and a nend manufacturer sewn
end for you guys who don't know are the
chips that are the actual storage chips
in here so the advantage intel has a
manufacturer's they get to kind of save
the the cream of the cream for
themselves meaning they can provide
their three year warranty with lots of
confidence this is the desktop
installation okay bright so sorry so
it's a sound force drive just like the
other ones but the difference is that it
uses 20 nanometer NAND as opposed to 25
nanometer NAND and the other two drives
until has done this without compromising
performance so it's rated at exactly the
same speeds in terms of sustained reads
and writes as well as I ops but it is at
a fairly aggressive price point out
there in the market it's available in a
couple of different capacities so I've
got the 180 gig one here today that
includes the desktop installation kit so
we're going to go ahead and see what
they had to say for themselves so other
than their three-year warranty there the
box contains and him the SSD itself so
there you go pretty standard SSD looks
like an SSD I still remember the old
intel ssds where they had that fat
ghetto finish on the top of it that was
just like absolutely brutal and made it
look like like a third tier SSD now they
have a much more professional looking
finish on the top and I mean this might
seem like sort of a quibble but when you
put something like this in your system
you might want to put it on display
somewhere the old ones were just kind of
Rio there there's that old finish so
they hit it on the bottom now but at any
rate it's got your standard 9 millimeter
form factor so that means it might not
fit in the very slimmest of slim
notebooks but just double check make
sure that you need a nine millimeter
drive as opposed to a seven millimeter
drive and you'll be good to go next up
inside we've got a speed demon sticker
they're so you can put that on your
forehead or your dog or wherever else
you want to put it a quick start guide
giving you instructions on how to
install it in your desktop as well as an
installation guide and warranty disk it
also says here the Intel data migration
software can be downloaded from intel
com such cool stuff SSD installation
that's actually a huge value add because
my grading your system from a hard drive
to an SSD can be a bit of a pain in the
butt I mean personally I've purchased
software that I spent like 50 bucks on
that's great for migrating drives but
not everyone wants to do that and not
every brand of SSD includes the software
that you need are some of them include
ones that are just totally inadequate
and don't work very well Intel's one I
have used it works only on Intel drives
and it works really really well so there
you go we've got a molex to SATA power
adapter all the screws you need a SATA
cable as well as the two and a half to
three inch chin three and a half inch
desktop bracket so it includes
everything you need to install it in a
notebook or a desktop system and I think
that's pretty much all there is to say
about it it's a mainstream option so
it's not intended as a replacement for
the 520 series which is their extreme
performance SSD and I think that pretty
much wraps it up thank you for checking
out this unboxing and first look at the
Intel 335 series SSD don't forget to
subscribe to I this tech tips from
unboxings reviews on other computer
videos yeah I forgot to mention the
actual advantage of 20 meter NAND flash
is that it this Drive consumes less
power than the old 330 series so there
you go I forgot something sorry about
that it's not the first time I've done
it I suppose</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
