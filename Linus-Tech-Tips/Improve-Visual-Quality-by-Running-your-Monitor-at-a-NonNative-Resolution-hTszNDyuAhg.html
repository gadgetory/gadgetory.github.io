click now to learn more all right guys
before we get started if you're not
entirely sure what anti-aliasing is
either click here or open up a new tab
to check out Linus's video on
anti-aliasing and he can explain
everything about it if you do know what
anti-aliasing is let's move on to down
sampling down sampling or more properly
known as ordered grid super sampling
anti-aliasing rog ssa for short or how
linus likes to call it original gangster
SS AAA is the effect of utilizing your
GPUs power to render an image at a
higher resolution than your monitor is
capable of displaying than having it
rescale that image to the native
resolution of your monitor instead of
just rendering the edges of polygons at
a higher resolution like some other
anti-aliasing solutions this solution is
rendering everything at a higher
resolution all of the time which makes
your game look great but it's incredibly
inefficient at the same time compared to
traditional AAA solutions so if it's
that inefficient why do it well the main
reason that I have is that sometimes a
game is released that doesn't have a
options or maybe just an on-off switch
which does something these options
lacking games are usually crappy console
ports and the enthusiasts like us demand
more so OD SS AAA is our solution to
force our own AAA
into the game effectively doing the
developers job for them and making it
look better with the sacrifice of a
little bit of fps but why wouldn't you
simply force AAA through the driver you
ask well this doesn't always work and
even though it usually will work it may
not be enough anti-aliasing for you and
if you have the extra horsepower you may
as well apply it
speaking of extra horsepower you can mix
so GSS AAA with other types of AAA so
whether or not you're injecting AAA or
if the game supports different types you
can run those different types alongside
OGS SA or down sampling to get a great
experience of your game this is mostly
tuned in my opinion to older games that
your PC would traditionally be able to
run with
even Really Trying now you can throw a
bunch of stuff at it make it a little
bit harder for your PC to run but then
it get a great visual experience out of
the game I'd like to thank a few people
first off taboo burn from the Linus tech
tips forums for making a thread about
this and making us realize that we
should probably make a video about it
then next up is neogaf scorer key who
created an amazingly simple and very
detailed guide for NVIDIA users and able
to do down sampling over on goo-goo 3ds
forums black zero also created an
awesome guide for AMD users thank all of
you guys for making this possible and
everybody if you're wondering how to do
this please follow a link below this
video to our forum where you can find
taboo burns posts you can find links
there to Corky and black zeros posts you
can get detailed information whether or
not you're in Nvidia or AMD user this
video will focus on the solution for
NVIDIA users this is because of how
ghetto and broken the AMD solution
actually is that being said if you're an
AMD user and you're interested in doing
this feel free to click on the link in
the description below which will take
you to tab of Burns Post which will take
you over to the forum where black zero
has a post on guru 3d which you can
follow and try this out for yourself if
AMD had a stable and in driver solution
we would have been happy to include them
in this video as well for this guide
we'll be using Windows 7 just a heads up
to users for Windows 8 and 8.1 it may
not be a hundred percent stable but
you'll probably be fine so just continue
along and I wouldn't worry too much
about it also for this guide we will be
using a GTX 780 Ti because it's super
strong and we can show you a ton of
different setups and not worry too much
about performance
you don't need a 780ti to be able to do
this at all I wouldn't worry too much
about it another reason why we're using
this card though is because the modern
cards seem to minimize compatibility
headaches and other issues along the way
that older cards may have all right guys
on the forum please post what operating
system using what monitor using and what
graphics cards are using and what your
results were so we can get a little bit
of a database going on of what works for
me personally my PA 2 for aq both of
them were not able to go above 2560 by
1600 but my LGA 29 um 65 in the office
was able to easily downsample a 4k
signal so I'd love to see what you guys
are able to do
alright guys so the first thing we're
going to want to do is go into the
nvidia control panel by right-clicking
on our desktop and then selecting Nvidia
control panel once inside we're going to
click on adjust desktop size and
position make sure the check box is
selected for override the scaling mode
set by games and programs and then click
apply next under display you'll select
change resolution click customize select
enable resolutions not exposed by the
display click create custom resolution
on a horizontal pixels type in 2560 and
under vertical lines type in 1440 and
then click test hopefully it was
successful click yes to save that
resolution if the test worked you're
going to go black for a second and then
it'll show in the crazy resolution and
then it'll show up in this list if 2560
by 1440 P was successful for you and
you're feeling a little bit ambitious we
can go on and try and create a 4k
sixteen by nine resolution so in our
horizontal pixels you're going to want
to type in thirty eight forty and then
under vertical lines you're going to
want to type in 20 160 then click test
and hopefully it works
save that resolution as well if it did
work for you then that will add that to
the list as well if you're stuck on a
certain resolution and you want to push
it further and you're being quite
adventurous don't worry there's still
some stuff you can do but they're quite
advanced and very set up specific so
please check out Porky's thread on
neogaf and post on our forum with the
different things that you try out there
are some manual settings you can key in
but they're pretty finicky so it'll take
some playing around good luck so in
terms of performance it seems like in
Crysis 3 at least down sampling from
2560 by 1440 P down to 1080p was about
the same as running 1080p with 8x MSAA
on and visually they look pretty
comparable as well we're going to show
some shots here but I highly suggest
going to the forum and viewing them
there as YouTube is going to have
compression and it's not really going to
look right so check them out on the
forum without compression maybe download
them yourselves
and again post screenshots of yourself
trying this out maybe in different
combinations and all that kind of stuff
to the forums we need a little bit of a
database going on what looks good and
what different setups work alright guys
thanks for watching if you want to tell
me what you guys think about this
of experimenting style video post out in
the comments below while you're down
there don't forget to like or maybe even
dislike the video and subscribe if you
want to if you guys want to put input
into you trying out down sampling don't
forget to put that on the forum as well
and while you're there if you don't like
the ads on the forum be sure to
contribute at any contribution level you
get rid of all the ads on the forum and
if you guys want to learn is tech tips
shirt be sure to check out district
lines there's a link in the description
you can get those there we've got some
really cool stuff coming thanks for
watching I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
