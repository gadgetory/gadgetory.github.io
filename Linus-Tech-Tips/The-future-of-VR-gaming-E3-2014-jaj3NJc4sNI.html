brought to you by hyperx fury series
high-performance SSDs the Corsair
Vengeance k70 and k90 RGB mechanical
keyboards and NCIX com our trusted
retailer for high-performance gaming pcs
alright guys I was able to check out a
whole bunch of the VR games that oculus
was showing off this year so I got to
check out alien isolation super hot
Lucky's tale and eval curry it was a
really interesting a range of games you
could tell that Lucky's tale and eval
curry were more tunes to the experience
than something like alien isolation
alien isolation was a lot of fun and it
was interesting being able to like peer
through slots on lockers and stuff like
that but where the immersion would break
was when you have to look at this radar
thing to be able to check out movement
but you lean forward in your chair so
when you press the button to take the
radar gun out its behind your back like
literally if you lean forward your guy
pulls out the radar gun behind you which
is kind of really awkward not very well
tuned you'll notice that stuff like
control VR and different body tracking
things are going to become needed for
these types of games or they're gonna
have to be programmed very differently
it's going to be an interesting
experience and even polymer himself has
commented on how different interaction
and different inputs for VR to be very
important and we'll have to see a lot of
those coming down in the future I'm
excited to see what happens with control
they are but I'm not sure if that's
necessarily the one that's going to end
up the biggest we'll see down the line
thank you guys for watching thanks to
hyperx corsair and NCIX for bringing us
here this year hope you guys watch all
the way through III content you can do
that by subscribing to Linus tech tips
and i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
