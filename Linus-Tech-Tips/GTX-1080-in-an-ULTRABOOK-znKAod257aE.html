with the Triton 700 a new predator
laptop from Acer what we're going to be
doing is too hot for TV we are not only
going to be taking you guys on a tour of
the outside of an utterly groundbreaking
gaming laptop we are going to be
cracking the casing open for the first
time we're opening up a new merch store
you can check out some of our new gear
today at the link in the video
description that is a weird layout yes
we'll get to that but first the displays
1920 by 1080 60 Hertz they are not
talking about whether or not it's g-sync
which presumably means that it will be
because if it wasn't there would be no
Nvidia breathing down their neck so I'm
talking about how to be do you think so
that that would be my assumption there
but I could be incorrect about that on
the back you're going to find actually
fairly complete i/o we've got power in
HDMI 2.0 as well as DisplayPort
whichever standard that is they aren't
talking about that but at the moment
we've got our power button Thunderbolt
nice addition we've got USB 3 and look
at that an Ethernet port out on this
side we've got two more USB threes audio
and this is a really smart idea
a little recessed USB port so your
wireless mouse dongle doesn't get caught
on stuff when you're sliding it in and
out of your bag so the trackpad uses
Gorilla Glass it's got a very
unconventional trapezoid shaped kind of
outline here on a glossy surface that
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to have
to be totally honest with you guys
not a fan it's a weird shape it's a
different aspect ratio than the display
and when there's no tactile feedback
when I'm going off the trackpad I just
end up confused because I'm really not
that smart
okay then we've got the keyboard even as
even as a person who legitimately
carries around a mouse pad and a mouse
at all times even as one of those freaks
I'm still not a huge fan of the we're
trackpad positioning it's better than
I've seen in the past so they're calling
it like a mechanical type keyboard I'd
say it's a little stiffer than what's on
the blade as it is but this whether
intentionally or unintentionally is
where it gets to be actually somewhat
usable because the laptop is so thin
that you can actually rest your wrists
on the table next to it instead of
having to rely on also carting around a
wrist rest with you we interrupt this
program to bring you breaking news that
we learned later after this is the mouse
the keyboard is RGB the software is not
working yet but individual key back leg
we know let's get to the part you guys
have all been waiting for
I never show up at one of these events
without my trusty tool kit whoa-ho-ho-ho
hold on a minute here oh you got the
ribbon connector for the keyboard let's
try not to break their their prototype
unit your oh it's turned on okay one
second go ahead in that house over here
ha ha yeah holy crap is that six heat
pipes in here and these are connected to
a whopping four heat sinks to near the
back on the side and then two more of
them at the back and then the whole
thing is cooled by these are so these
are pretty special these are what
they're calling their twin arrow blade
fans these are a second generation of
the design that uses like these these
razor thin blades on it maybe I should
up okay I think I just crossed a line
here I mean very thin pieces of metal on
the fan so in order to achieve what
they're claiming is 35% improved airflow
over more conventional fans but of
course when you see a lot of cooling
it's like a where there's smoke there's
fire right where there's a lot of
cooling there must be a lot of
performance so you've got two sodium
slots allowing you to install up to 32
gigs let's see what's in here so this is
yep so they've got 32 gigs of DDR for
sodium memory in here they've got a what
else
this is a really cool battery I'm sure
like very few other people are going to
geek out over this battery but holy crap
is that ever sin
they've got Hall I love this copper
cooling for the up to dual MDOT two
slots right here so you can run raid
zero nvme SSDs for boot up to 512 gig
killer Wireless and of course here
you've got the name story the high-end
model the first one coming is going to
be $29.99 this is a three thousand
dollar laptop so under these pink pipes
here what we know is that we're getting
a core i7 7700 HQ and I would speculate
that that's right there next to the
memory what we don't know is the tenth
generation graphics that acer is going
to be equipping it with what we do know
is that it's testgen
what we also know is that acer had a
slide showing it was going to be over 40
percent faster than a late 2016 blade
and what we also know is that hey we had
it turned on for the time being that's a
gtx 1080 in there Acer says this
notebook will be overclockable whoa I
have to repair this electronic device
what will I do wait huh I think I got
something
oh yes never more than an arm's reach
away is my iFixit pro tech tool kit or
one of the dozen or so that I have
because these things are flippin awesome
you probably know I fix it from the
thousands upon thousands of free guides
over on their website ifixit.com but
what not everyone knows is that they
also have all the tools spare parts and
accessories that you need to complete
your latest electronics repair and the
best part is you can get a whole Pro
Tech tool kit for usually less than what
it would cost to have someone else fix
your device once and you can use it many
many times prying tools screwing tools
suction tools you're pretty much
freaking name it and the best part is
you can use offer code lines that
to save $5 on a purchase of $10 or more
and it comes with a lifetime warranty
