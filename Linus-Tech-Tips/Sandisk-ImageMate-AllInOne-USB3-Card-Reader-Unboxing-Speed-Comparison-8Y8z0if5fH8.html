welcome to my unboxing of the image made
all-in-one USB 3 reader and writer yes
it reads it writes it slices it dices
and you might think that ok I'm boxing
something like a card reader is sort of
pointless but I'm gonna be a hundred
percent truthful with you guys I needed
one and you might say well why did you
need one every notebook ever made has a
built-in card reader and card readers
aren't that expensive and you could just
sort of get one well the truth of the
matter is that commodity card readers
the USB 2 varieties just aren't really
fast enough for us these days so having
something that runs off of USB 3 makes a
significant difference when you're
copying anywhere from you know 16 gigs
to 32 gigs or more of data at a time off
of cards on to something else so in
order to sort of do a practical
demonstration of what kind of a
difference this will make we're gonna
walk through the product itself which is
actually kinda nice looking I like the
ID here so it's got a little metal stand
here that actually has some heft to it
so it's got three little rubber feet on
the bottom go ahead and put that
wherever you want then it has three
plugs on the front so we've got compact
flash SD HD XC MMC if seriously is
anyone still using MMC go home ms pro
duo pro duo all that good stuff so
memory stick if you still use those and
the micro SDXC or HD or whatever you
want in the top at the back you find a
USB 3 micro interface which I still hate
but there doesn't really seem to be any
getting around it when it comes to
things like external USB 3 devices that
need a slim connector so in this case
they wanted to go for a slim sexy form
factor so that is what we end up with
the bat arvo okay what I was afraid was
going to be the bad news about this
product is that USB 3 cables are quite
bulky they do have more pins than USB 2
cables so I was worried that what was
gonna happen is it was just going to tip
this over but the weight of the stand on
the bottom does seem to prevent that
from happening so that's almost unless
you put
all the way to the cable behind it so
there you go microSD cards these days
we've got the latest SanDisk Extreme UHS
of 164 gig microSD card we're going to
throw that in an adapter since most
notebooks don't really support like
dedicated microSD slots for the most
part this is why it's still handy
especially for us where we're using
different media such as compact flash or
whatever else I'm gonna head go ahead
and copy the smaller of these two files
to the desktop copy and replace yep so
let's go ahead and see how long it takes
on USB - we're gonna see speeds in the
neighborhood of around eighteen to
nineteen megabytes per second maybe 20
megabytes per second sustained and so
yeah there's the convenience of having
the different slots and being able to
plug multiple cards into them at the
same time and there's also a speed
advantage now this is a micro SD card if
we were looking at a very
high-performance full-sized SD card we'd
be able to more effectively leverage the
additional bandwidth that USB 3 affords
us but it's just for the sake of you
know doing a quick and dirty demo to
show that there is a difference even
with a microSD slot we're going to go
ahead and plug this microSD card into
our card reader which is already plugged
into the PC there we go
hopefully that'll get detected pretty
quick we're gonna take that same file
and we're gonna overwrite it again and
see if we do get things going on in a
bit faster here there we go so funny
story when we were trying that demo
before filming it
we accidentally had the card reader
plugged into a USB 2 port which means we
were seeing exactly the same bottleneck
so we were all in the well not quite the
same bottleneck because it's still a
better performing card reader so we were
seeing around 22 23 megabytes per second
and we haven't actually looked up the
specs of this particular SD card because
we only got it in order to demo that USB
3 is faster so we were like oh send just
sent us a micro SD that's kind of weird
so we didn't know it was actually going
to be around 80 megabytes per second
sustained reads which it turned out to
be which was a very effective demo for
how much faster USB 3 is so there you
have it guys we're not perfect but
sometimes it works out anyway like the
video if you liked the video just like
it if you didn't leave a comment if you
were somewhere in between and as always
