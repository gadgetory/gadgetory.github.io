look at a new product from masseuse it's
kind of like a random product I don't
know where this came out of total
left-field here but it's called the
assist cross link and I haven't tried it
yet so I don't know exactly how it works
but supposedly this is a way to easily
share Internet and optical drive
functionalities between two computers
you can instantly sync and transfer data
between two PC's it is USB 2.0 so I'm
assuming the transfer rate is going to
be 480 megabit per second which is USB
2.0 speed now here is a quick overview
of what you're able to do so it is a
data link remote share folder link
outlook link and flash share so this is
a two gig flash drive as far as I can
tell and then the other piece is a USB a
two mini connector so okay they've got
system requirements are pretty much
anything running XP okay so that's
that's pretty straightforward
and then they show you okay data link
optical drive share so they show you you
you've used the cross leg functions over
the week view blah blah blah you connect
two computers with okay let's just open
it up and have a look at this thing
because it's wow that just came right
off it's a very cryptic product because
to me it's always seemed obvious that
there should be some way to just take a
couple computers and just kind of plug
them together and just transfer data
over and it comes with absolutely no
user guide whatsoever so I guess all
we're gonna be able to do here is have a
quick look at the cross link product and
then I'll have to post my thoughts on
the annotations in the video so if you
watch this before I have a chance to do
it then I apologize for not having as
much detail as I like but okay so that's
that's kind of neat so you can cut it
you can do this with it and I'm not sure
what the point of that is but there you
can hide via the USB connector if you
want and then you can see that this is
just a USB mini connector here plugs in
there and then that's just a standard
cable so as long as you have this piece
you should be able to transfer data from
one computer to another effortlessly
including sharing optical drives which
is really cool because personally I
don't have really have a reason to have
an optical drive in my computer anymore
I rarely use it so it'd be kind of handy
to be able to just kind of like plug one
in whenever
and use my laptop as an optical drive
whenever I need to thank you for
