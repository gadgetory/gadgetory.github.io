where I share my frustrations with you a
little bit I have as some of you know I
have what I call the Linus Edition Ram
this is some older ocz memory that was
custom done for me you can see there
isn't even a part number on it or
anything like that you've probably never
seen a black and blue color scheme like
this with an XT C heat spreader it was
really really cool really special so I
had 24 gigs of it that's six by four
gigs and it's like the coolest thing
ever I'm super proud of it and saw some
more than whatever it's broken now so I
was running into issues where the
computer that was running it you can see
I only have five of the sticks here one
of the sticks is known good and it's in
my wife's machine right now so she has
four gigs of memory which I'd love to
increase so that won't have to video
edit on her machine it's got enough
memory and all that good stuff so what
happened was her machine started blue
screening randomly and I was only using
three of the sticks in her machine at
the time and so I pulled out memory I
swapped memory until I found one that
wasn't causing problems anymore and now
I am left with the challenge of finding
you know it's like out of five sticks
now I have to find not only the one that
I know is dead so this is the one that
seemed to be causing the problems with
her machine so what I did was I
confirmed this one was dead by using
prime95 blend and I'll show you guys the
settings I'm using later this is why I
hate overclocking memory because memory
issues are so hard to diagnose and so
hard to narrow down to what's working or
what's not or what's causing the issue
unless you're the rest of your system is
a hundred percent completely rock-solid
I wouldn't even begin to touch memory
because it's much much more finicky so
that one that one's dead because what
happened was I took four sticks and I
ran them in quad channel on this
motherboard I set it to the settings I
know the memory works at so 1600 C 9
1.65 volts
default timings other than that one T
command rate and I got errors after
about eight hours so I did every stick
one by one all five of these sticks in
dim slot one ran them individually at
the same settings remember guys it's
less stressful for the memory to run in
individual mode than it is in a
multi-channel mode so this is the only
one that actually failed it failed after
about 10
hours of prime95 blend which is very
frustrating because it makes the whole
process take a long time so then I went
oh yeah okay great everything must be
good now so all I have to do now is take
the four remaining sticks and run them
in quad-channel and it'll pass so after
about 10 hours it failed which means
that at least one of the sticks in here
is still bad even though it was able to
run on its own it can't run in a
multi-channel configuration so since
then I have taken this one out and I
tried to run these three and it failed
then I took this one out and I put this
one back in and tried to run these ones
in triple-channel and as you guys can
see like that peoples ask me all the
time how long should I run my
configuration in prime or some other
stress test before I know it's stable
and I come back to them I say 24 hours
or 48 hours like oh I read it for 3
hours and it didn't do fail so it must
be must be ok then right no no no it
isn't because you see here torture tests
can encounter an error 7 hours and 54
minutes in no problem so the settings
that I'm using here so if your system
makes a mathematical error it is not
stable now that error could cause any
number of things to happen it could
cause a game to crash it could cause a
program to kind of lock up for a second
it could cause your entire operating
system to corrupt you don't know what an
error will do until you have an error
and it does something so that's why I do
not tolerate any errors in my machines
and people who are like yeah i overclock
my cpu to whatever and pretty stable
it's game stable no no game stable is
not stable stable is stable so to show
you guys the settings i'm using i'm
using the blend preset and then I'm
going custom and then I'm adjusting the
memory to use to something near to what
so I'd go with something like that I'd
go I'm you know C's 11 and a half
gigabytes if we're going to have 12 gigs
of memory in there so what I'm going to
do now that I know I'm hoping it's only
one more stick that's dead because they
used to run in these settings just fine
so this one remember I know this one's
dead this one's going on the wall with
the other legendary stuff so what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to shut the
system down like it takes days to
diagnose
a dead memory stick especially with
these multi-channel configurations we
have now where you can have up to eight
sticks of memory in a desktop machine it
means ridiculous so now I've tested this
this and this and I've tested this this
and this and I'm still getting errors so
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
put this guy back in and I'm going to
take out one of these guys and we're
going to see how that how that goes for
us it's always important when you're
testing this kind of stuff like if I put
them in all the wrong slots then they
might all be running in single-channel
mode so you want to populate the the
DIMM slots in the right order so there's
there you go see they're all they're all
labeled there so I need to make sure I'm
populating a1 b1 and
yeah there we go and c1 in order to get
this working so the system shut down
just going to go ahead and grab myself
on the power supply here turn the power
supply off just because you never know
when a system is going to you know go
ahead and just turn itself on when
you're in the middle of working on it
because it happens let me tell you that
was a scary one I just like I plugged in
a I plugged in a PCI Express card in the
system powered on before I'd even
finished getting it into the slot I was
like oh yay dead card dead board they
didn't die they were okay actually okay
so there you go so now I'm going to see
if maybe my stick B is dead it's
important to label stuff I mean I can I
can remember but either you know
especially when all the memory looks the
same it's important to make sure you
actually do label things so anyway there
we go so then we're going to power back
up and it's going to need in other hoops
I need to turn my power supply back on
sorry
power it back up and hopefully it
doesn't take another eight hours to find
the error again but I've already been
working on this for days and it's been
very frustrating so there you go guys
how to diagnose memory problems takes a
while mem test 86 is another one but it
used to be I mean just like prime it
used to be a lot faster back when it
didn't have to go through you know
twelve sixteen twenty-four forty-eight
gigs of memory in order to find out if
there was any kind of problem and yeah
yeah don't forget to subscribe - tech
tips from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and I hope this has been
helpful remember guys if you're having a
stability issue with your system the
things to check
memory make sure your memory is a
hundred percent stable power supply if
memory isn't the problem it's probably
your power supply and then you move on
to your motherboard and then you move on
to it's probably a software issue unless
you're you know your video card driver
is crashing or something very specific
and you can go okay yeah that's probably
the video card thanks guys take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
