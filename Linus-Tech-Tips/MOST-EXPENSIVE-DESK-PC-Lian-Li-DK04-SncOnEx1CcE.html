faint of heart it's big its bold it's
covered in brushed aluminum fingerprint
magnet goodness and it costs a whopping
fifteen hundred US dollars and for those
of you who are about to ask no that does
not include any actual PC hardware so
first thought oh man this desk is PC
porn at its finest second thought hmm
it's covered in fingerprints already I
should have probably been wearing some
of these before I loved it
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel they're the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description so the journey begins
then on a strong note unlike our DIY
desk PC project and to a lesser degree
the vector desk mini the d.ko 4 comes
preassembled so right out of the box the
desks height can be adjusted via the
controls on the front with a height
range that's adequate for anyone from
Dennis all the way to Taran my only
gripe with this up desk like
functionality is the massive exposed
power supply that is visibly positioned
inside the case it makes the movement
features feel like kind of an
afterthought and for $1,500 a small
metal piece could have easily been used
to cover up the power supply while we're
at it the two six-foot cables that cover
the short distance between the power
supply and the motor and controller
probably also could have been cut to
size aside from that the interior of the
desk is very clean until of course you
touch it and touch it we will we decided
on a balls-to-the-wall content creation
rig that reached just shy of 6,000
dollars including the desk and all the
water cooling components and I know that
might sound like a lot and that's
because it is the brain of our system
was a pretty easy choice Intel's Core i7
69 hundred K might not be an extreme
addition but it's still an 8 core
monster and the $700 we saved over the
69 50 X allowed us to splurge on a 1.2
terabyte 750 series nvme SSD for
lightning fast system responsiveness as
for memory G skills Trident Z 64 gig kit
in white was the perfect mate for our
color scheme or lack of color scheme as
it were and on that note the x99 Strix
from a soos was perfect for our build
other than the orange lighting which we
really felt had
to go something we thought would be easy
but not so much now there's nowhere to
install an IO shield due to the way the
rear cables route so we put that away
then it was time to work on our lighting
the Strix is ARRA compatible but with
the included red green and blue dials on
the front of the desk we opted not to
use software controls and I think all
the other RGB purists will agree
individual channel control knobs are the
only way to go for full hipster RGB
satisfaction with the board in the desc
the next logical step was a power supply
Corsairs RM 1000 x was chosen yet again
for its simple understated looks and
perfectly overkill capacity which allows
us to keep the fan off even under load
on the subject of cooling we know you
guys have been craving hardline and so
the choice was clear this tubing it's
clear also it's hard line ek water
blocks is 12 millimeter clear PE TG is
affordable and designed to match up
perfectly with the plethora of 12
millimeter hard line fittings that they
provided in a sleek and sexy black
finish so I'm glad we cleared that up
speaking of clear to keep our 8
processing course nice and frosty
there was no debating the DK's plexi top
supremacy evil was a great choice for
both performance and aesthetics not to
mention it matches our GT X 1080 that we
definitely used instead of a TI because
the extra power doesn't make much of a
difference while video editing and
definitely not because the 1080 TI block
didn't show up on time yeh customs our
360 millimetre ekp e series radiator
mounted on this super bizarre front
bracket that doesn't have enough
clearance for fans to fit underneath
according to Lee and Lee this was to
save the exterior from the up to 16 fan
screws that could be installed in it
but in my opinion there's still no
reason they couldn't have enlarged it
for the fans and the screws that would
go on them especially because there's a
large magnetic fan filter that covers
this area anyway with the radiator
installed there's just enough room for
our x3 400 reservoirs tube which we
mounted on the two and a half inch drive
bays to run next to it and while the
upper drive mounts aren't designed for
this purpose they ended up working quite
well though back to the word design it's
kind of a key word here Lee and Lee's
manual talks about radiator mounting but
makes no mention of other water cooling
components so we ended up securing our
pump to one of the two lower SSD mounts
next to a one terabyte Samsung 850 Evo
with a ghetto washer that Jake made out
of a cable anchor with some super
professional-looking electrical tapes
leaving and we just found that that was
while functional a bit frustrating for
such a physically large enthusiast grade
product we think some more thought could
have been put into the custom water
cooling scene rather than just focusing
on a iOS going back to the tubing Jake
and Ivan went full liners tech tips at
this stage and with the build mostly
complete finally took it upon themselves
to figure out the best way to route the
tubing in true ltte fashion they did
pull through and ended up with a couple
bends that look very clean with the rest
of the tubes actually being fairly
straight TM with the help of about 150
dollars worth of eks black hard-line and
90 degree fittings with all the tubing
in place and tightened Jake rigged up an
interesting fill port by screwing a
funnel into an extension which did leak
a bit but not nearly as much as the wide
open port on the bottom of the reservoir
there was one small leak we discovered
shortly after the filling but other than
that we were
Goldin damn is hard line ever awesome
when somebody else has to deal with it
cabling was next and oh we sure messed
up here cables definitely should have
been done before filling to prevent
possible bump induced leaks the result
though was monochromatic cable mod
cables that fit the bill perfectly in
what I'm calling an alpine white so with
everything installed the glass on and
after 30 minutes of wiping off all the
fingerprints that somehow still managed
to get on the brushed aluminum we've
come back to the same conclusion we
started with this thing is gorgeous and
you don't even have to cover it up I
mean you could put a monitor down on top
of your build with the default stand or
you can actually use this mounting point
at the back of the desk to install a
monitor arm it does cause some light
leakage but in my opinion is a
worthwhile trade-off which brings us
then to the conclusion if you're a PC
enthusiast with a ton of that young cash
burning a hole in your pocket and you
were planning on spending a thousand
plus dollars on a desk anyway well then
the decal four could be the perfect
product for you you do need to be a
little prepared for Lee and Lee's form
before function approach but considering
the alternative we are now officially
out of components to put over there
leading us to more problems
particle board does not like moisture
have the controller on the outside no
yeah it actually looks pretty darn
appealing we've teamed up with ZOTAC and
HTC to bring you a truly immersive
