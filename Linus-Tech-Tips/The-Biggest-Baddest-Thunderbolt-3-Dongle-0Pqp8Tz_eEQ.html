the first Thunderbolt 3 docks on the
market allowing you to break free from
your jungle bondage promising a single
cable solution to easily transform your
laptop into a workstation something we
do at our office all the time without
sacrificing one of your highly coveted
Thunderbolt 3 ports but can it deliver
on these promises and at $200 could it
possibly be worth it let's find out
shall we
the master keys pro keyboard lineup from
Coolermaster is available in three sizes
each in white or RGB flavours check them
out at the link below
the relentless onward march of
technology can sometimes leave us
stranded with legacy gadgets the tf3
Lite attempt to both solve the problem
of adapting a newer physical USB
standard to your older devices and
thanks to Thunderbolt
restore the port's that we've given up
for the sake of thinner and lighter
devices without compromising performance
so it's equipped with one USB type-c and
to Taipei's a Gigabit Ethernet port
audio out and in and one DisplayPort 1.2
port of course it also sports two
Thunderbolt three ports though it should
be noted that one of them will always be
occupied it's used to connect the device
to your Windows or Mac PC with no manual
driver installation required that's a
fair bit of IO by today's standards but
is it enough to let you ditch your
dongles I guess that depends on your
needs really let's start with the good
things the USB ports all operate at the
USB 3.1 gen2 on five gigabit per second
transfer speed so we saw real-world
speeds of 300 to 350 megabytes per
second on our angel bird SSDs ample for
a modern external single SSD but it
should be noted that if you were to use
a high-end external drive that relies on
raid for increased speeds over USB 3 10
gigabit you may experience some
bottlenecking
on these ports the good news though is
that the Thunderbolt 3 port silly is a
very cool connector can operate at USB
310 gig as long as you don't need it for
additional Thunderbolt devices or a
second DisplayPort monitor now on to the
mediocre it only has two type-a ports a
number easily eaten up by a keyboard and
mouse unless you want to dongle your
dongle
it also lacks an SD card reader and
we're on to the sub mediocre now the
audio ports are nice to have but they
should really be on the front in my
opinion and they introduced an
impermissible which is a no-go for
anyone who wants to listen to music at
low volume but hold on a minute that
dongle roundup you did recently had what
seemed to be some much cheaper solutions
that offered pretty similar
functionalities
some of them even had SD ports so why
should I spend more than 70 bucks well
the answer is that as great as this
thing is it's not Thunderbolt 3
compliant and that means no DisplayPort
so it's not capable of driving a 5k
monitor or dual 4k monitors and in fact
is even limited to 30 Hertz operation
for a single 4k monitor the ts3 Lite
handles all of these scenarios at 60
Hertz as long as your OCD can handle
potentially needing two different cable
types in order to achieve it and what
about that extra Thunderbolt 3 port does
that make the TF three light worth the
price of admission well maybe but I
would make the argument that it's most
valuable if your machine only has one
Thunderbolt 3 port being able to daisy
chain up to six Thunderbolt devices
gives you a lot of groovy options though
this does fall apart a little when you
consider that most devices with only one
Thunderbolt 3 port also have other i/o
decreasing the need for the TF 3 lights
other ports and I mean let's say your
machine does have multiple Thunderbolt 3
ports like the 2016 MacBook Pro well
then you could easily just plug in a
dongle for your peripherals and a second
cable for your monitor when you sit down
so maybe then the best argument to be
made for the TF 3 light is that it's a 1
cable solution being able to take your
laptop around the office for meetings
then plunk it down quickly at your desk
that's great except it's not quite all
kitty cats and tacos in this area either
you still have to plug in your wall
charger because even though the tf3
light comes with a honkin power brick it
only pushes 15 watts over the type-c
connector enough to charge your phone
and probably operate your computer but
not enough to charge your computer this
is especially a drag if you have a
monitor that will charge your macbook
through its USB type-c port like LG's
ultra fine 5k or 4k 27 UD 88 because
you'll actually lose that capability if
you're running through the dock which
come to think of it some of these
monitors actually have a decent amount
of their own i/o so maybe a USB type-c
monitor with a dongle hanging off the
back of it is a better one cord solution
right now though with that said Cal
digit does have an upcoming non lite
version that will charge your machine if
you're not ready to invest in a new
monitor so we want to hear about it in
the comments what is your setup like is
USBC enough for you is Thunderbolt a
cool solution looking for a problem or
are you already on your way to Amazon to
buy a ts3 light right now let us know so
