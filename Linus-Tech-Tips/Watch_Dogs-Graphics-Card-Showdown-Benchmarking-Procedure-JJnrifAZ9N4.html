com the series of events surrounding
watchdogs has been interesting to say
the least
starting with the leaked game that had
coal miners injected in the code by the
guy that hacked it ridiculous and then
going into a and be complaining about
NVIDIA game works and how it's actually
kept and be away from the developers of
watchdogs and has kept them from
optimizing the game to run on AMD cards
and the performance issues that came
from that which we'll be exploring more
later and then people comparing
screenshots an in-game footage to the e3
2012 footage that we see that we saw
much earlier and then comparing that to
how the same thing happened with Far Cry
where with the early III footage it
looked better than the final version
that people actually received so after
all of this crazy storm of news how does
this game actually perform now while
it's true AMD had very limited time with
the game due to games works and all that
kind of stuff kind of similar to how I
had very limited time to the game due to
not getting a reviewers code which was
not awesome it isn't as bad as I
expected when I saw the Forbes article
posted on our forum and I saw the
massive amount of pages of comments and
I read a lot of the comments and I read
the Forbes article I expected serious
doom and gloom and then once I started
testing the game it wasn't that bad the
AMD cards are not that far behind their
tear equivalent Nvidia cards and looking
into seriously this game needs patches
so watchdogs patches in the future you
can probably go see why and other
people's actual reviews of the game but
personally I believe it needs some
serious patches and as AMD releases more
drivers for watchdogs in the future I
expect this gap to close up and I don't
think this is gonna be a terrible
terrible issue although I am certain
that games work games works did affect
things as far as day 1 launch goes in
the future once AMD has had more time
with the game and once watchdogs is able
to release patches of their own I'll be
more than happy to do stuff like 4k
benchmarks in 2560 by 1440 P and
playing around with a lot more settings
but as of right now it just kind of
feels weird the game shouldn't really be
as hard to run as it is I mean it's a
good enough looking game but it's not
exactly making my jaw drop the entire
time I'm playing it and any system I
throw at it is extremely under stress
the entire time so I'm very interested
to see what happens here and I recommend
unless you have an absolutely
ridiculously beast computer don't even
bother with ultra textures because it's
insanity it's gonna destroy the V Graham
on your cards and you're gonna have some
you're actually gonna have some issues
running it maybe if you have a six view
byte 780ti or something that has six few
bytes of erm on it you can play around
with that kind of stuff but that'll be
up to you to figure out another thing
that I might want to stay wary of is to
take advantage of your GPUs max buffered
frames because this game really needs it
and it will really help I know the party
started this isn't exactly the most
ambitious benchmarking run I've ever
done essentially for the first bit I
just kind of walked to a car while he's
on his phone and then God the first part
that's closest to me and then drive
around for a little bit although the
reason why I used it is because I was
able to find a pretty repeatable
segments within a very short time of
have another game in future benchmarks
I'll probably find a different segments
that I can get a little bit more flavor
into the benchmark try and get some
explosions and whatnot going on except
for the one little simple one that I
have in this credit benchmark just to
show off the game a little bit more but
then I'm also hoping that by the time I
get back going on there will probably be
patches and better drivers and whatnot
to support those
when you first get in this car just look
right behind you at the thing on the
ground over there and hold Q and it'll
make it explode what I do here is I take
off at full speed out of the parking lot
but then once I get onto the road just
because it's random what car will be
there I try to regulate my speed by
tapping W in a certain pacing and I can
kind of compare about how fast I'm going
depending on other cars on the road
because the cars on the road are usually
going about the same speed for every run
I never actually really stopped to this
benchmark just kind of weave in between
cars and stuff it makes it fairly
consistent because I just try to keep my
speed above the same the whole time and
just weave in between cars although it
does make us you have to kind of squeeze
between things like that from time to
time yeah
also this traffic light up here is
avoidable by just making it green
causing a crash and then going around
the crash your benchmark should stop
somewhere right about you this game has
been really interesting to follow since
launch due to all the controversy and
stuff that's been going on around it
tell me what you think about watchdogs
