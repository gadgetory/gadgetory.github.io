performance this is with the vest of
3050 with the SLI performance package
that we actually talked about a little
while back this is a very exciting new
title for NVIDIA it's actually coming
free if you buy a gtx 465 470 or 480
from NCIX so that's something that's
pretty cool and you should probably be
aware of any way this game is fully
Nvidia technology out so that means it
has full support for physics including
entirely destructible environments that
means that everything in the game pretty
much can be destroyed and the damage is
persistent so all the debris lies around
anything that's been completely trashed
whether it's bullet holes explosions
whatever else actually stays that way
you've got great ragdoll physics
including on the clothing for all of the
characters so this is all powered by
physics and this system as I mentioned
in my previous video has two gtx 460 s
we're running this at 1920 x 1080 so
that's 1080p with all of the details
maxed out in game now that means that
we've only got 2x anti-aliasing but it
as you can see provides a very stunning
visual experience now something you
should also be aware of like it's all
the subtle little things right when you
have an explosion like that fire that
was well there a while back sorry about
that if the character standing nearby
it'll actually ripple the clothing on
his body that's how detailed the the
physics calculations that are being done
on the GPU are for this particular game
this is basically what physics should
have been ages ago but really it came
down to developer support for NVIDIA to
be able to really implement it the way
that it should be done here we're just
doing a flyby back through the little
little demo level that we've seen you
can see stuffs kind of still falling
down still falling apart here's our
character walking out check out the
clothing though that's one of the
coolest things about this game also many
of the particle effects whether we're
talking about smoke from explosions or
whatever else are being done with
physics rather than just being like a
actually here this is a really cool
effect too what about all the glass
flies out when the explosion goes off
inside anyway thank you for checking out
our video
on mafia 2 as well as the nvidia
technologies that go behind it as run on
the avesta 3050 sli performance package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
