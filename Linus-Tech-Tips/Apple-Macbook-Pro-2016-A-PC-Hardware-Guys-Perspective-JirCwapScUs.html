death and for the most part by people
who are more intimately familiar with
mac OS so take this video for what it is
I'll look at the dongle Book Pro 2016
but from the perspective of a long time
windows user who isn't expecting to
switch platforms anytime soon
so my MacBook Pro 2016 took so long to
arrive because I hastily cancelled my
order for a top spec 13-inch when I
realized its best core i7 CPU was a
dual-core with hyper-threading what
so my 15-inch then rocks a core i7 69 20
HQ hyper threaded quad core 16 gigs of
dual channel low power ddr3 memory a
Radeon pro 460 discrete graphics card
with 4 gigs of memory and a wicked fast
1 terabyte nvme SSD for which I paid or
at least dbrand paid thanks Bros a cool
3500 US dollars
Paul so what else do I get for their
money hmm
well at 28 80 by 1880 wide gamut display
with a blinding peak brightness of 500
nits it's absolutely stunning a surprise
to no one by the way some not overly
loud but very competent speakers a 5500
milliamp hour battery a touch bar above
the completely redesigned keyboard a
gigantic trackpad a cooling system that
gets a little shouty under heavy load
but whose ability to intake air from the
sides even when sitting on something
like a bedsheet is definitely
appreciated and a highly controversial
IO configuration that includes a single
headphone microphone combo jack and four
Thunderbolt 3 ports let's start though
with some spec discussion is the MacBook
Pro 2016 overpriced for the hardware
that you get if you mean by that
is Apple's markup over their cost from
their suppliers higher than the typical
PC OEM then yes looking at something
like Dells XPS 15 a similarly positioned
PC the pro 2016 doesn't look very
competitive raw spec for spec the Radeon
pro 460 comes very close to a last gen
960 m the top-end bottle CPU ends up
modeling down to nearly the same speed
as the lower spec 6700 HQ on the Dell
under an intensive mixed CPU GPU load
and it costs nearly a thousand dollars
more for the same capacity SSD but
assuming that the professional work
you're doing doesn't require more than
16 gigs of ram or above a mid tier AMD
GPU and you prefer mac OS then it'll
more than fulfill your needs it's not
like it's not a fast machine without
unique and attractive features like the
noticeably bigger screen thanks to its
more square aspect ratio it's just
expensive which you should probably be
used to by now and IO is depending on
whether you're forward-thinking or
whether you want your shiny new machine
to work with all the stuff you've
already got in your pockets arguably
vastly superior intel on durable 3 has
some huge real-world user benefits not
the least of which is the massive 40
gigabit throughput enabled on each of
the 4 ports on the MacBook Pro 2016 that
is to say if you're willing to invest in
the costly but incredibly versatile
external devices ranging from
professional audio and video equipment
to wicked fast storage and even external
PCI Express enclosures that could be
used to add devices like Red Rocket X
accelerators or video cards in theory
more on that later because there are
still more benefits each port is also
capable of 10 Gigabit USB 3.1 gen2 HDMI
and DisplayPort using relatively
inexpensive passive dongles and they
carry power two ways to boot hooking up
the macbook pro to my LG 38 you see 99
is a treat and a half charging USB hub
and DisplayPort 4 it's 38 80 by 1600
resolution at 75 Hertz all in one cable
that feels like the future but Apple's
decision isn't without its issues the
absence of man
safer power aside the biggest problem
with thunderbolt is how confusing it is
for consumers Thunderbolt 3 uses a
reversible USB type-c connector which
can also be found on pure USB 3 devices
or even USB 2 devices and Thunderbolt 2
used a mini DisplayPort connector even
though they are not the same standard at
all look at all these 1 star reviews for
a Thunderbolt 3 to funderbolt
2 adapter from people who are upset that
they can't run their mini DisplayPort
monitor they don't realize that
Thunderbolt only outputs to a display
port monitor if it's daisy chained
through an actual Thunderbolt device
first and I don't blame them they needed
this adapter and then maybe this one Oh
making matters worse Apple has
intentionally locked out Thunderbolt 3
devices using Texas Instruments
first-generation TPS 65 982 USB C and
power delivery controller from Mac OS so
everything that I'm aware of today
including my razor core and a kitty o
external storage box you plug it in and
nothing no error message
nothing I mean I don't honestly expect
that to come up a whole lot since most
people will never need more than the i/o
expansion of a handy little dongle like
this one from juiced systems that I
picked up to add Ethernet and SD reading
capabilities to my blade but it does
mean that until second-generation TP s
65 983 based Thunderbolt 3 devices
arrive you'll be using all of your ports
in USB mode unless you want to run
Windows where funnily enough both of
those devices work just fine but that's
not a great experience for a variety of
reasons
boot camp is super easy to use but
almost none of the MacBook Pro 2016's
strongest points translate well to the
windows experience touch ID is the bees
pajamas as the
kids are saying almost as good as
windows hello for sign in and better for
paying for stuff doesn't work in Windows
the display is still good so there's
that but the touch bar just works as a
typical F row without any of the very
cool and shockingly intuitive contextual
controls that make everything from
watching media to interacting with the
calculator application much easier and
the trackpad sucks plenty in Windows if
viewed in a vacuum I mean who would need
to right click and drag anyway right
but is especially offensive compared to
how amazing it is in Mac OS in my first
couple of weeks with this device I went
from feeling like it must have been
built so large as an accessibility
feature for old people to understanding
why Mac people are always saying that
they rarely feel the need to use the
mouse the acceleration curve is perfect
gestures become second nature in minutes
and the palm rejection which I was
really worried about when I saw how big
it was is outstanding though I can't say
the same of the keyboard I don't hate it
as much as I did initially and I never
hated it for the same reasons as some
others I don't find the noise annoying
but while I did grow more comfortable
with it as time went on I never truly
got up to speed even if it's not
something that I can easily measure
using a typing test which I did attempt
to do it's like um the short travel is
fine for burst typing maybe even better
making it optimal for tweets or SMS
replies getting text messages on the
computer with continuity is amazing by
the way I was using an iPhone 7 during
my review period and like ah the Apple
ecosystem it does work well together
tooling around with slow-mo footage in
Final Cut Pro X's almost as great as its
admittedly lightning-fast project
exports but back to the keyboard I never
got comfortable enough with it that I
felt like I wanted to work on a longer
writing project
typing suggestions in the touch bar
won't help anyone but the most egregious
hunt-and-peck errs which is exactly what
allowed me to come to peace with this
product I'm not going to repeat what
everyone else is saying this laptop
isn't pro because Apple is probably
sitting at their headquarters down in
Cupertino going daah nothing we make is
designed for pros how many actually
bloody pro creative professionals are
even out there and as for programmers no
Escape key I mean who cares you were
probably hacking Linux onto a Chromebook
anyway Apple has redefined the
conventional products tiers in a way
that apparently giving that these things
are selling like hotcakes makes sense to
people
mainstream now means browsing Facebook
not having a hundred printers and crap
connected and Pro now means you want
peripherals and some more performance or
in the case of the 13-inch you don't
even really need the horses you just
want to feel like one of the cool kids
and spending more money to adjust your
volume or scrub through a YouTube video
faster is going to get you there and as
for anyone beyond that the true power
users well those guys are going to
customize and hack the crap out of it to
get the experience they want anyway at
least they will if they can afford one
and they're willing to put up with the
well managed during standby and under
light loads but less than advertised
battery life dbrand
specifically requested that I turn
around the laptop for the integration
part of the video so you could admire
the marble finish but they didn't say
anything about me leaving it like that
so I'm going with now you can't see
anything
haha anyway D brand is your source for
awesome vinyl skins they've got skins
for laptops phones tablets consoles
controllers and more they use only high
quality authentic true textured 3m vinyl
on every product and they feature
unrivaled precision yes my friends if
you are willing to spend the time you
can get a perfect fit with a D brand
skin
it looks great and protects against
incidental dings and scratches and their
customer service robots are easy to deal
with and wonderful did I mention that
they ship worldwide
well they do so you can check them out
at the video description and make your
device look fantastic today not today
but soon because it ships to you so
