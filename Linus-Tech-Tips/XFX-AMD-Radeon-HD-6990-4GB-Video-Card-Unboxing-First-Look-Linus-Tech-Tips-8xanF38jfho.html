high-end graphics card unboxing time
again this is the Radeon HD 6990 it
features HD 3d technology eyefinity
technology apparently a PCI Express 2.0
one bustle that's not really a feature
at this point but this is check this out
four gigs of gddr5 memory yes four gigs
of memory on a consumer-level graphics
card madness and you can see that's one
of the things they actually also call
out here we've got five star XFX support
okay something about Radeon graphics so
remember five star XFX support I'm not
sure what all of the stars are exactly
but I can tell you a few of the things
so they do have a modder friendly
warranty which means that you can remove
the stock cooler although there are some
reasons not to remove the stock cooler
this particular motherboard because the
thermal compound that they're using is
some kind of fancy phase-change thermal
compound which it's you can't really
replace with anything equivalent so it's
engineered for the best cooling
performance out of the box okay so it's
about that going for it and then it's
also got double lifetime warranty which
means that even if you sell the card you
can transfer the warranty to someone
else this is an XFX card so that's why
you get those benefits let's see what we
got on the back here so four gigs
yeah yeah we got that four gigs of
memory I finiti with native support for
up to four simultaneous displays now
that's funny because I've seen
documentation saying it supports up to
five so why don't you guys just give me
a moment here alright well my
confidential AMD slide deck doesn't seem
to really give me much indication in one
way or the other so what we're going to
do is we're going to break open the
seals and then over the next few days I
will find out for certain one way or the
other by just trying it same way I often
do things okay so here we go here's
another featureless DirectX 11 eyefinity
technology 1080p full HD display port
1.2 HDMI 1.4 a 7.1 HD surround sound out
a via HDMI and four gigabytes of ddr4
which I guess they felt they better
mention again since
it wasn't enough other places on the Box
I'm just kidding it was okay so I'll put
the box here let's put this down here
and there we go XFX force calm just in
case you guys want to check out their
website so I'm not going to talk too
much until we get the card itself out
here so we bought a North American
limited warranty which I believe is
going to be lifetime but I believe you
better go make sure you register that so
yeah we go okay some of the imodium do
graphics cards are some drivers download
the latest from the AMD website okay
quick install guide okay how to use your
driver CD and then we've got one of
those sweet X effects do not disturb I'm
gaining door hangers alright some foam
good quality foam nice closed cell stuff
and there it is
the 6990 go ahead and pull it out that
is a long graphics card Wow
okay let's just make sure we've finished
with all the accessories and then we'll
get to the card itself here we go this
is here and it has three minutes so a
couple things first of all we have a
mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter okay
next we have a mini DisplayPort to tell
if it's active or passive well let's say
it's passive DVI and then we have aha
mini DisplayPort to active DVI all right
so it's Eyefinity ready out of the box
even if you have three DVI monitors okay
we've got a crossfire bridge and let's
go ahead and pile all of this back into
here pile this into here let's move this
out of the way and let's admire this
little engineering marvel
here that is as of the time of filming
this the fastest graphics card in the
world so that's it the Radeon 6990 let's
start at the front so we've got kind of
a classic ATI graphic on the front which
XFX has been using since they started
making AMD or ATI whichever you prefer
graphics cards on the top we find
something a couple things that are very
interesting so we've got their new color
scheme which debuted with the 6870 we
have two eight pin connectors now that
is a first for a mass production card
and previously what we've seen is a six
plus an eight typically on the very high
end card but there you have it we now
have two eight pin connectors remember
eight pin connectors are capable of
delivering up to 150 watts of power each
to the card plus the 75 Watts that can
be delivered via the PCIe slot so
remember that for later okay we also
have something here which we are going
to remove which is a little caution tape
so caution read something before
something take it off okay so caution
read owner's manual before removing why
would you want to do that you ask the
reason you would want to do that is
because by removing this and changing
the bios switch position remember most
of the new 6900 series cards come with
this dual BIOS switch by changing the
position you are actually going to
overclock your card well beyond the PCI
Express spec and unlock it to a full
dual 6970 graphics cores in here versus
the slightly down clocked default
shipping configuration so this is not
necessarily guaranteed to work with
every system and every power supply and
every motherboard but AMD has left the
option there for users to tinker with
the stock configuration of the card and
overclock it out of the factory just
with the flick of a switch very cool ok
back of the card okay there's like a
rubber couple rubber grommets here on
the back of the card not really sure
what those are for but that's
interesting alright we've also got two
back plates here holding on the the
vapor chamber heat sinks that are hidden
by this shroud there's our PCI Express
slot there at the bottom let's go ahead
and flip it over again where we will see
not really much of anything interesting
okay back to the front oh yeah something
else of note is that this heatsink
design is not the typical one that we've
seen with AMD's dual dual GPU
configurations so it uses a center fan
instead of one fan at the side and then
two heat sinks on the one side and then
all rear exhaust so this is a half rear
exhaust half internal exhaust designed
card so what that means is that a Mew is
able to use two identical heat sinks in
the past they were typically using an
aluminum heatsink closest to the fan
where it gets the cooler air and then a
proper heatsink further away from the
fan to get a little bit more cooling
power out of it but now since both GPUs
are cooled in the same way by the fan
they actually both use identical vapor
chamber coolers so there you can see
that they're all the exhaust comes out
this way you can actually kind of see
the video there you can see the copper
of the vapor chamber with the aluminum
fins on top of it and then let's go
ahead and turn the card around this way
where we will be also be able to see the
fins down there I hope you guys can see
that there you go as well as the rear
output so this doesn't really shed any
additional light on whether or not it
supports five simultaneous displays out
so so yeah we'll figure that out later
but we've got one DVI and four mini
DisplayPort I can tell you guys now it
supports at least four-way Eyefinity so
yeah we'll figure out exactly how much
further than at least that it goes later
on now power for this board actually
let's talk let's talk
overall specs here so by default the
card comes clocked at 830 megahertz and
it is capable of 5.1 teraflops overall
compute performance but if you go ahead
and flick this switch it actually turns
up the core voltages and it overclocks
the cores to 880 megahertz now in terms
of the stream processors and all of the
other architectural information about
these cores on here these are both full
Kamin course so it is essentially two
69 70s once you have flipped the switch
and unlocked the full power of the board
now speaking of power it runs at a
maximum power of well for typical gaming
load about 350 Watts when you do not
flip the switch and it can get as high
as for 15 watts or even as high as 450
at the very maximum that is the ceiling
that is built into power tune if you
flip the switch so what is power toon
power toon basically was introduced a
little while back in his AMD's way of
controlling the TDP or the overall
thermal the overall thermals of a card
that is capable of well up to 450 watts
so it controls the clock speeds in order
to ensure that you're not going to burn
out your card but something like a fir
mark but it also allows you to deliver
maximum performance in 3d games now the
overall design of the board had to
accommodate the incredible power of
delivering electricity to two of these
GPUs four gigs of memory everything else
that they're doing so aim DS using an
all-new volterra powered vrm that is
going to deliver clean stable power to
your 6990 card so thank you for checking
out my unboxing don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips as well as
my NCIX comm channel where I'm going to
be filling you guys in with more details
about this card as I have them don't
forget to subscribe I think I just said
that oh well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
