optimized for silent operation click now
to learn more welcome to my unboxing an
overview of the SteelSeries 5h v3 so as
you may or may not have figured out the
5hb three comes after the Toulon before
presumably the four because if steel
series is going to keep rolling the way
that they've been rolling for this last
little while with more better audio
products all the time we'll probably see
a new revision at some point but in the
meantime this is what we've got folks so
packaging wise it's pretty
straightforward you take it out and then
you have the headset sitting there undo
the little clips at the back that's hot
I'll twist it up in there
so what's different about the v3 number
one is they have upgraded the drivers so
the drivers for those of you who aren't
uninitiated are the speakers inside each
of the ear cups so it should offer
better audio quality than the outgoing
5hv to the outside of those drivers
they've also upgraded the materials for
the ear cups themselves so instead of a
cloth covering they're now using a faux
leather covering with memory foam inside
so hopefully you guys can get a pretty
good idea of how cushy those are this
does a couple of things too number one
is it will make them more comfortable
and number two is it actually improves
the passive noise isolations so there's
no active noise cancelling or anything
like that but there's less sound leaking
in and leaking out of these compared to
if they were using a cloth covering for
the ear cups now this is obviously
optimal for something like a tournament
environment and the H Series is their
tournament grade headsets another thing
that's optimal for that if you travel
around a lot is having it disassembled
so you can take it apart and chuck it in
your bag I suspect many people won't use
this feature even if they are traveling
with it but hey it's there so you can
use it if you want the contacts are very
robust looking so you can actually see
how the wiring is done between the two
near cups so I wouldn't worry about
those wearing out over time alright so
let's move around to the left side here
yes that right there a steal serious
staple the infinitely poseable see that
look at that I love that put it wherever
you want the infinitely poseable
retractable microphone the actual reason
I switched from my HD 5 v 5s for gaming
to the SteelSeries 7 HS back when I got
those a couple years ago
as with any SteelSeries headset I would
expect the microphone to be good quality
some gaming headsets have microphones
but they're terrible I have never yet
had this experience with a SteelSeries
headset the headphones are of course
adjustable so you can go anywhere from
sort of super tall cone head guy setting
so right about you know they're down to
something that's um quite a bit too
small for me so it kind of sits on the
bottoms of my earlobes I wear a medium
size motorcycle helmet so that should
give you guys some idea what's up
there's a little bit of rotation in the
ear cups there but not a ton I think for
most people that's really not gonna be
an issue but if your ears happen to sit
very far back or very far forward then
it's something to bear in mind and then
you've got about this much rotation in
them this way so like vertical swiveling
or whatever the case may be the cable is
very nice so they're using a double
braided cable this time around and that
might seem like it doesn't matter but if
you have cats it might or if you you
know run over your cable with your mouse
particularly vigorously not but I've
actually no matter but cats definitely
if your cats try to chew through this
cable they will have less success than a
single braided or a non braided cable
and then that leads to the inline
control which hasn't been changed since
the last generation product so it's
basically got a microphone mute or not
mute as well as a volume dial now this
goes all the way down to I yes now we're
getting into the SteelSeries the other
steel series classic sort of flexibility
thing that they got going on so right
here it's their swappable cable system
so you can actually switch from the two
connector so two three pulls right there
to this guy right here a single floor
pull so you can actually use the five
hv3 with a mobile device or Ultrabook or
anything that only has a single audio
jack for both headphones and microphones
and then they've also got their included
extension cables these are really handy
I don't even necessarily use them on my
headphones because I usually have
something in the front of Mike
case or something sitting on my desk but
these are just really handy if you need
like you know audio extension cables so
I use them all the time so there you go
you can either extend them or just use
the nice short cable here and turn them
in termina made it terminate it in
whatever type of ending you desire thank
