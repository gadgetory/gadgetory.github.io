card as it follows in the 970 s
footsteps numerically and has an
aggressive price point of 449 US dollars
for the founders edition and 379 US
dollars for the custom versions that
will come later steam hardware survey B

the video description first let's start
with specs the gtx 1070 is the second
card in their new Pascal lineup and it
features a GP 104 chip with 1920 cuda
cores compared to the 1080s 2560 and
runs at a boost clock of 1683 megahertz
compared to the 1080 17 33 megahertz it
also features the nice new 16 nanometer
process unlike the GTX 10 80s shiny new
gddr5 X memory the 1070 is still
sporting gddr5 but is claiming the title
of the world's fastest version of said
memory as well as running out of the box
at eight gigabit per second that paired
with the new memory compression
algorithm which gives you effectively
20% additional bandwidth results in 8
gigs of some pretty damn fast GDR 5 but
beyond draw specs there are some other
features NVIDIA has baked into the
Pascal cookie as well such as
simultaneous multipe rejection and ansel
which make vr gaming and multi monitor
gaming way better and bring gaming
screen shots into basically the future
along with some improvements to Nvidia
VR works but if you want to hear more
about those click here to check them out
in the official launch review for the
GTX 1080i spend more time on them there
we got our hands on the founders Edition
which sounds fancy but is really just
what Nvidia is calling the reference
version and selling for as previously
mentioned 449 dollars a full 70 bucks
more than the MSRP for bass models from
adding board partners whose
cards we might be able to see it
Computex this year but I expects more of
the 10 80s to be shown off than the 10
70s as the launch is so close the
seemingly Deus Ex inspired shroud
features a similar aesthetic to the
silver and black shrouds with blower
style fans that NVIDIA has been using
for the past few generations but with
more angles this time around
connectivity is good as it features HDMI
2.0 for 4k it 60 Hertz 3 DisplayPort 1.4
connectors for 4k at 120 Hertz or 8k at
60 Hertz holy crap and dual link DVI SLI
is a little confusing these days because
of the introduction of new types of
multi GPU support with DirectX 12 what
you need to know for now is that classic
nvidia sli only supports two-way
configurations by default and allows
users to request something called an
enthusiast key directly from Nvidia
which will unlock three-way and four-way
SLI even though it is no longer
recommended by video there is more
information to be discussed here like
in-depth looks at MDA also known as
multi display adapter mode and LD a
explicit also known as linked display
adapter explicit mode but we'll cover
that in a future video exploring the
performance differences and general
support of each mode so stay tuned for
that
also just a quick note before moving on
it doesn't seem like we have a bunch of
AMD cards in our testing it's because
their new Polaris architecture which is
supposed to compete with Pascal is right
around the corner we'll have much more
from the red team when those cards drop
with that said let's have a look at how
our benchmarking turned out we test it
at 4k and 1440p even if you're watching
this and have a 1080p monitor it's
better when wielding this much power to
run your games at higher resolutions
anyway with something called super
sampling to make things look super nice
we have a guide on that here although
we've been waiting for the VR games
market to mature a bit before reviewing
how good this thing is with the rift and
the vive I did want to investigate what
resolution exactly this card should
actually be aimed at for standard
desktop gaming we know from the
investigation of the 1080 that the 1080
is
rather capable 4k card as we kind of
expected and while the story isn't the
same for the 1070
it's impressive in its own way with
maxed out settings at every resolution
it destroyed 1080p gaming showing that
even with a minor amount of pulling back
on the settings you would have a card
that can give you the performance you
need for your shiny new one-hundred and
forty Hertz monitor at 1440p it kept
flexing its muscles never dropping below
60fps with all of the settings cranked
on whatever the highest preset was then
in 4k it didn't quite sit up with its
bigger brother but still managed higher
than 30fps in every title with the
settings cranked even a little bit
higher with everything put to the max
even above what the highest preset in
some games were okay so it's mainly a
1440p card if you're going for beauty or
a 1080p card if you're going for a wild
framerate gaming or a 4k card if you
want to dial back on a fair bit of
different settings or don't mind gaming
at 30fps although I don't really
recommend that if you can avoid it at
1440p it handily beats its predecessor
the 970 while we did expect this after
the launch it's still quite awesome to
see a card that isn't the flagship
performs so well speaking of which what
about dollars per frame well as expected
the 1070 kind of rocks the 1080 was
already pretty good but it was against
really big beastly expensive setups at
4k the 1070 when put up against more
standard competition and something that
you'd expect more people to run still
performs quite impressively we still
need to wait for AMD's Polaris to really
see where it lines up but for now I'm
quite happy for power draw the entire
bench only drew 216 watts from the wall
which is ridiculous and gives you
borderline unlimited options for lower
wattage power supplies thermals were
even lower than expected as well sitting
at 78 degrees Celsius just wow in
conclusion the 1070 really looks like
the card it needed to be sure the 1080
is great but its cost was also great the
1070 is able to destroy 1080p gaming
which is still the most popular
resolution and gives people fantastic
options for high refresh rate monitors
and even gives out that sweet sweet
nectar
1440p gaming at 60fps are above all i
have to say is to those that delayed
upgrading their rigs for the Fastpass
like few months and to my random friend
ryan it's coming man this is very
possibly the card that you were waiting
for
