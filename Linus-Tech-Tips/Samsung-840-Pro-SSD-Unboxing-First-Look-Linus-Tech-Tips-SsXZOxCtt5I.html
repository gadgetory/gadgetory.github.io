the Samsung 840 Pro Series SSD so moving
right along to what makes the 840 pro
special three core MDX controller now
this okay so this is a part of what
makes Samsung special on a bigger level
it's the fact that Samsung is the only
one who actually designs and
manufactures their own SSDs I was about
to say STDs they design and manufacture
STDs no they don't do that their own
SSDs from top to bottom everything from
the controller they design and
manufacture it to the RAM they designed
and manufacture it to the flash which
they design and manufacture to the
firmware which they design and code and
replicate manufacturer everyone else is
relying on someone else on a hardware
level or on a software level next thing
here is they're using toggle ddr2 NAND
flash memory toggle DDR 2.0 NAND flash
memory okay
LP ddr2 sdram cache memory AES 256-bit
encryption is built-in which basically
means that they take whatever password
that you've created for your SSD
reconfigure it 14 times and make it
pretty darn difficult to crack so you
can set that up on a BIOS level to make
sure that whoever gets your computer is
not actually going to be able to access
any of your data they'll still be able
to format the drive but they won't be
able to actually read anything on there
without some pretty serious hacking
tools next up we've got their magician
software which is basically a toolkit of
software that allows you to do
performance optimization so you can
manually trim the drive you can do it
like a simple benchmark you can secure
erase it you can still good because SSDs
are shock resistant you can do firmware
updates so all that stuff that you'd
expect from an SSD toolkit this
particular Drive has a five-year
warranty so the pro drive is positioned
above the regular 840 it does use mlc
flash which is basically two bits per
cell compared to three bits per cell on
the regular 840 they do use the same
controller technology however so
the main difference is in the flash
being used and that's another one of the
reasons why Samsung gives this one a
five year warranty versus the three year
warranty on the 40 because they are
expecting that mlc flash to put up with
an enthusiast level usage pattern for
well at least five years and my typical
observation is that when a manufacturer
gives you a three year warranty they are
expecting it to last more like six to
eight years when they give you a five
year warranty they're expecting it to
last longer than that because I mean I
can tell you guys right now based on how
much margin there is and something like
flash and RAM and controllers and
everything that's in here they cannot
afford to five years from now be
replacing all of them it doesn't work
that way they can afford to be replacing
a very very very small percentage of
them one of the other luxuries that
Samsung enjoys because they manufacture
everything that goes in the drive is
that they can kind of save the best for
themselves so Samsung sells flash
Samsung sells RAM to other guys to
manufacture SSDs but it's all about
binning so if you guys understand the
bidding process you know that what
Samsung is doing is they're
manufacturing like a butt ton of flash
and then they're gonna go okay well this
is the grade-a stuff this is the grade-b
stuff grade C and that stuff's gonna go
in like USB thumb drives or whatever
else like that and this is the like
other stuff that we're just gonna put
over here and then put that in our own
products don't worry about it don't
worry about it customers we got this we
got this one so I think that pretty much
covers it the 840 pro if you have missed
any of it that I said so far is about as
fast as it gets for an SSD today say 2 3
6 gigabit per second it has a super-fast
controller it's capable of something
ridiculous like it's a hundred thousand
I ops on ya reads up to a hundred
thousand I ops and writes up to 90
thousand I ops so those are random it
has a five-year warranty do I say that
already
