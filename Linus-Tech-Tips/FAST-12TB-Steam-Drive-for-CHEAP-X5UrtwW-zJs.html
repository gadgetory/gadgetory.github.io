this little module here was positioned
as enabling SSD like performance on a
hard drive but only for a boot drive a
significant limitation because the
supported motherboards were so new that
it was likely they'd already be running
an SSD for their OS anyway so the
technology worked well but the value
proposition for enthusiasts like me in
particular was a little tough to find
which is why when Intel reached out
about doing a sponsored video on octane
we said sorry we're legitimately hash
tag out of ideas
unless you guys could add support for
accelerating like a secondary game drive
or something well funny story they did
it so we made a lightning fast 12
terabytes team drive on the cheap
all right so for the uninitiated 3d
crosspoint is a non-volatile memory
technology jointly developed by Intel
and micron what makes it different from
the NAND flash that you'd find in a
typical SSD is it's much higher
endurance that is how many times you can
write to it and it's much lower latency
with a price that's comfortably in
between RAM and NAND flash so the idea
here is that even though our 32 gigabyte
module is only 0.2% of the capacity of
our 12 terabyte drive here it's read
speeds and in particular its access
latency should give even a really large
storage drive like this SSD like
performance because the files that need
to get accessed all the time aren't
actually that big so as a baseline then
we're gonna start by testing game
loading times off of two standalone
drives a hard drive and a high capacity
SSD in this corner we've got Seagate
Barracuda Pro 12 terabyte hard drive
boosting a sustain transfer rate of 250
megabytes per second and a humongous 256
megabytes card that's like the same
amount of RAM is my first pc and in the
opposite corner we've got the 3.8 4
terabytes p.m. 863 a SSD coming straight
at us and some with v9 flash up to 520
megabytes per second sequential reads
and 4 gigabytes of cache it doesn't have
the best dollar per gig ratio but this
is a battle all the heavy way
okay sorry I'll stop this stick now
before starting our tests we picked a
handful of games that would be
impractical to store on a dedicated SSD
unless you're a mega baller GTA 5
fallout 4 witcher 3 and Deus Ex they all
take up a ton of space then we maxed out
the in-game graphics settings and loaded
a pre levelled saved game with a few
dozen logs loaded into Skyrim to
simulate a more realistic scenario for
anyone who's still playing Skyrim we
used Assassin's Creed origins discovery
mode load times and the first level of
the campaign infer honor each set was
run three times with reboots in between
we also did three back-to-back sets with
the hard drive
without rebooting to see what effect its
huge cache would have so we didn't see
anything unexpected overall but what was
cool was that the large cache built
right into this drive does seem to have
an effect on its loading times in some
of the titles as long as the system
doesn't get rebooted in between this
could be a really good sign for our
opting accelerated drive because unlike
a cache built into the drive the data
stays on it in between boots and with
the exception of Witcher 3 and for honor
the load times of our combined solution
tanked below that of a bear hard drive
but there's nothing unexpected here like
accelerating a boot drive it's the
nature of the caching beast that before
it's had a chance to analyze the data
it'll perform the same or maybe even
worse so let's give this a reboot and do
it again
interesting so as it turns out it only
took a second run for our hard drive
octane combo to drop its loading times
in every title except for Witcher 3 to
the same or faster levels than a regular
SSD so we are actually going to have to
reboot one more
time and see if this continues during
our third run the already impressive
results stayed about the same
with Assassin's Creed dropping below SSD
level load times and then even GTA 5
showing a slight improvement so this is
really cool we can see a couple of
things at play here so first of all the
cache is working second it does work
across reboots and third there is a big
advantage to running it like this over
even just having a bigger DRAM cache on
your hard drive because it's so big it
can hold enough data to cache multiple
modern titles so even if you're not the
kind of person who just plays the same
couple of games over and over you can
still benefit from it but will every
gamer benefit so we did a few more runs
with reboots in between in order to find
out and we found some interesting things
here some games continue to improve and
actually widen their gap from a
dedicated SSD while some games don't
scale at all so how about the value
proposition then well while your typical
SATA SSD from a reputable brand comes in
at about 300 dollars per terabyte a
combination of a Seagate hard drive and
an obtain module comes down to as low as
$38 per terabyte for legit SSD great
performance at least in all of the tests
that we ran this is somewhat offset by
the fact that accelerating a second
Drive requires an eighth gen Intel Core
processor and 300 series chipset as
opposed to seventh gen and 200 series
for primary drive acceleration but it is
something for anyone who is running that
platform to keep in mind
so thanks Intel for allowing data drive
caching now I can go back to the
satisfying sound of hard drive clickety
clicks without giving up speed this is
something that I have been asking for
since obtain launched I even asked about
it when I attended the pre-launch
briefing because it makes so much more
sense for enthusiasts because for your
OS you can buy a full-blown SSD or if
you're that hardcore
obtain 900p and run the whole thing in
obtain rather than using caching but
it's just not cost-effective for a game
drive where you can easily have multiple
terabytes of files that you only access
once in a while or in some cases never
humblebundle sorry excuse me it's also
worth noting that aside from games file
search times improved though with that
said I'm not sure if I would get one of
our writers to use my photo library as a
test case for this next time around so
thanks for watching guys if you dislike
this video you know what to do but if it
was awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one I'm not sure if this one will still
be there it's limited edition but also
