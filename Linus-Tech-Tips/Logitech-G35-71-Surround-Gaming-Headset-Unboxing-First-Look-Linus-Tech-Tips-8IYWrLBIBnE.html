boxing so to speak of the Logitech G 35
now you can see the box has clearly been
undone already but I made some critical
errors in the information during my
original unboxing so I figured I better
make sure that I do the product justice
and give you guys the most accurate
possible information so I am redoing it
so the first thing we're going to do is
have a look at the packaging itself
where we will find out some interesting
things about the product first of all
this right here 7.1 surround so that is
a virtual 7.1 surround that is powered
by Dolby technology okay so there are
two actual speakers so the 7.1 virtual
surround is a software thing all right
we have three swappable headband pads
that you choose the one that best fits
your head that is here okay then we have
three customizable G keys for OneTouch
command over music voice morphing and
more whatever you desire we have on your
audio controls for quick access to
volume mic mute and surround some
adjustments adjustable noise cancelling
microphone as well as full speed all
digital USB connection so that means
this has a built-in sound card so you
will not need any sound part at all in
your computer in order to use this
headset which has advantages and
disadvantages which we'll talk about in
a bit here's a Quick Start Guide here's
a survey safety and warranty as well as
a driver disk throw it away download the
latest off the Logitech website here we
will find a spacer and then digging in
even deeper we will find the g35 itself
aha
this is more than a spacer I'm sorry
guys here you are it also contains the
can you see that letter it also contains
the C cup and the B cup depending what
size your head is the one included by
default is an A so I'm going to go ahead
and put that on show you guys what the
g35 looks like and I'm also going to
show you guys why I am NOT a headful
model so here's the USB cable you can
see we're using a nice thick braided
cord here hopefully you can see that the
odds of that being destroyed by even the
most determined cat are fairly slim
here's the reasonable and low herbal
microphone it's got a bit of flex in it
so you can actually position it
according to where your mouth is quite
easily all right now I want to show you
guys the controls on the headset so
these are those programmable G keys
right here one two three we also have a
microphone mute as well as a volume
adjustment wheel here then there's the
surround sound
Turner offer or turn our back on err I
guess I could call it a switch so here
you can I don't know if you're going to
be able to see this but there's actually
one speaker in there so these surround
sound effects are done by software just
like with the courser hs1 which actually
brings us to the advantages and
disadvantages of a USB headset so the
advantage is that if you're using a
laptop or if you're using an onboard
sound you are going to have a better
overall quality from this approach the
disadvantage is that if you're using a
halfway-decent sound card then you're
not even going to get close with
whatever with whatever amplifier they're
able to power over USB and with whatever
sound chips that they're using and that
you're not even gonna be close not even
approaching a dedicated sound card and a
regular analog headset I mean I'd love
it if they gave you the option kind of
like some of the SteelSeries headsets
but them's the breaks we're dealing with
what we're dealing with here and it does
have a lot of flexibility that you don't
have with a regular headset and because
you can't install a sound card like I
said in a laptop which a lot of gamers
are using these days okay so let's have
a look at the overall build of the g35 I
suspect you'd have to have a pretty good
nurdrage going on in order to break this
you've got like the rubber top for the
headband here you've got a pretty
durable overall fit and finish to the
whole thing this is metal so where
you're actually resizing the headset I
can't imagine it would
break as you can see it's made of some
kind of yeah some kind of a metal it's
actually got little markers for all the
different sizes which is kind of a nice
touch because that way you can just kind
of someone borrows your heads that you
can remember oh I'm out size six and
then you can easily resize it without
fiddling around with it too much the ear
cups do rotate a little bit so depending
on whether your head to shape like this
or like this or whatever the case may be
it should fit you quite nicely and we
got the microphone and covered that and
I think that's pretty much it so thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
second look I suppose at the Logitech G
