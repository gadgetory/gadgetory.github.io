but it's actually just me scratching my
neck right before the show started and
on that on that note the show has now
started welcome to the wen show oh this
is awesome
iMessage brand in about 10 minutes ago
hey can I borrow you for a minute I'm at
the wine show set and he pokes his head
out the door as I'm recording the
pre-show starting bit deal and thinks
that I'm live and goes back away and
then I messaged him right afterwards
when I was done I'm like oh hey I'm
ready for you now
it takes them like eight minutes to see
it now he comes out I'm actually live
Brandon I just wanted you to have a look
at the color temperature of this light
it looks off it's been on for quite some
time is it adjustable it's like there's
like voodoo magic that goes on around
here adjustable color temperatures of
Lights he's actually kick-started some
legitimately color changing lights that
are going to be like now you can adjust
the white point you can adjust the color
point I'm clearly just stalling for time
while I wait for this doc to load up on
my screen here but that's okay cuz it's
here now we've got a lot of great topics
for you guys today Luke's gonna be
joining me on the show very very shortly
he's actually just finishing up a video
right behind me there yep he's there see
that trust me it is the actual the
actual Luke do I look better now I'm
like really bright now but that's okay
that's fine don't worry about it Brandon
it's all good so we've got a lot of
great stuff for you guys today
AMD's risin Vansant right this time
Rison has been detailed it's going to be
octa-core 2.4 gigahertz dynamic
overclocking we will talk more about
that for sure
Amazon's first prime air delivery has
taken place
Microsoft is bringing Cortana two
fridges toasters thermostats and Space
Marine suits near you and Crytek is
syncing
wages unpaid talent leaving will there
be another crisis I mean yes but not
with a why so let's go ahead and roll
the intro which has no audio long story
couldn't get it working don't don't
don't
do-do-do-do-do if you do I'm going to
use this time to post to Facebook that
we are starting the wine show do only
audio on the left channel how does that
work how do these things change who
changes these things ah hold on a second
wait what
how how how is this even possible how is
anything that it doesn't even have the
there's like a feature there's a feature
in xsplit to to mix them together okay
here we go copy left to right let's try
that it was on automatic um I don't know
go try that go let me know why is life
hard
speaking of life being hard Squarespace
makes it so that your life is not so
hard if that is to say if your life is
making a website on Squarespace also I
fix it which again
maybe doesn't make your life easier but
does make your life cheaper um
which maybe came across wrong but you
you save money so there you go you save
money on your repairs so it's it's like
it's harder to do it yourself but you
don't have to pay someone else to do it
but it's easier than if you didn't have
the necessary to you know what I give up
let's just let's just cancel way and
show this week nope I can't do it no not
because I'm sick
no we're not cancelling wedding so I'm
back I'm back all right
non-existent human figures his or her
left ear is now more used than his or
her right ear you know what I I take no
responsibility for any of that Brendon I
think it looks fine now thank you very
much for your hard work
except for that bounce card okay thank
you very much yes you may retrieve the
bounce card you know Brandon and I had a
deal we had a deal when we moved into
this warehouse the deal was that he
would get his very own corner of this
6000 square foot space that I acquired
and if I allocated him that corner I
wouldn't have to deal with all of his
crap all over the place that was the
deal that covenant that covenant Brandon
has been broken he okay the only reason
he doesn't have his spot is because it
has taken him over a year to get the set
built in it he had a budget from before
we moved in to get that done he just
didn't get it done um also oh I have
some other things that we just couldn't
get done news for you guys
this one's really exciting and closely
related to the audio issues that we had
shortly before the show started here so
focus right I don't know if you're
familiar with them but they make we
actually have one of their doodads here
and the only reason we're not using it
is because we've had issues with our
compressor and the microphone that we've
had hooked up to it anyway Focusrite
reached out to us and this is kind of
funny they reached out about doing a
review of some of their gear and I kind
of went you know what I don't think that
it
is going to carry a lot of credibility
if I come in and start reviewing like
professional audio gear and they're like
oh setup is like pretty good yeah you
know what so get out of here
yeah you're supposed to be not on the
show right now so so they're like oh why
is that and I go well you see we've got
this live show and we can never get the
we can never get the audio working and
it's taken literally years and they kind
of go oh well we could help you with
that
and I'm like well heck yeah so the plan
right now is for them to come down here
next week and we are going to share with
you guys all in one video everything
that we've done to improve when show
over the last little bit here so the new
capture cards you've noticed actually
for the last couple of months we haven't
had any capture issues the new lighting
setup that we've got actually the lights
themselves didn't change but it's really
quick to set up now which is pretty
freakin cool
we are completely redoing the win show
computer so Corsairs given us their new
case and we're going to like do up the
win show PC and finally Focusrite is
coming in to they are actually sending
technicians not just gear they were like
yeah we can send you all the gear you
want them like that's great
we have gear that's really not the
problem so they are sending us actual
texts either one or two to come and not
just set everything up for us but
actually show us how it all works so I'm
super duper excited and it is going to
be freaking awesome and with all these
improvements says John d03 why is the
show still late well today the show is
late because I had the brilliant idea of
not working on the video I was supposed
to be working on today which is a review
of the Asus g20 which is freaking
awesome so if I mean we're
use no doubt to take this as early
impressions okay so let me let me just
bring this I thought I had the page up
already yeah here it is let's go ahead
and screen share here so this puppy
right here
so take this as the early impressions
that it is the g20 CB man their names
suck but it's really small about ten
liters I think nine and a half liters
it's got a core i7 6700 in it and the
model I've got has a GTX 1080 with 512
gigs of SSD storage and one terabyte of
hard drive based storage and it is
unbelievably quiet for all the
performance they have managed to pack in
that tiny little enclosure really really
impressed so far anyway so instead of
working on that I was like you know
would be cool if I could find a way to
get OS 10 Sierra running on a
legitimately powerful laptop so I was
like I'm gonna try and hackintosh a
laptop today and I ran into a wide
variety of problems everything from
Apple's download server being so slow it
took me an hour to download OS 10 Sierra
on a gigabit connection so so there was
that there was the I'm doing it through
on rate I'm actually doing it through a
VM you know because which might actually
be easier for you yes so I found as like
step by step guide which is pretty much
what I need to do any hackintosh stuff
because I'm not an experienced
hackintosh sure the last time we did a
hackintosh thing I very closely followed
a step by step guide and still had
problem yeah so um uh what were some of
the other problems I had today III oh
yes right so the the guide was based on
creating the CR installer on Yosemite I
believe or El Capitan or something like
that so the disc utility has changed and
then I wasn't able to create an image
doing thing anyway I the original image
I created was on a 64 gig USB
five so so it was a sixty-four kick
image because I'm an idiot and like it
was just it was one of those I'm in a
rush so I'm doing things that are done
then it's not working very well types of
days today those are always brutal yeah
not that you'd know anything about that
today
yup only if I'm gonna be under the bus
I'm pulling you down with me oh that's
fair I was trying to do a I'm not gonna
tell you exactly what it is I was trying
to do a video on a laptop thing that I
was doing it included a laptop and I'm
gonna go back and keep working on it now
but the brightness was so low that
trying to record with a camera showed
like crazy flickering and then I was
like I was the genius who came in and
was like hey why don't we just capture
it on a separate device and then yeah it
doesn't have any HDMI port so VGA I
don't think we have a single VGA capture
device I don't know yeah yeah back to
get back to what you're doing alright
alright alright everybody wants me to
talk about AMD Rison which is not the
same as the ricin from Breaking Bad in
that it won't kill you I am gonna start
with this so first of all let's go ahead
and HK 0 5 was the original poster on
the forum and the source for the article
here was video cards dot-com here's a
bunch of information I'm going to kick
off with this that name is terrible they
might as well have brought back Doron as
far as I'm concerned nobody is going to
pronounce that rise in its risen why are
you and like why would you even draw
attention to something that your fans
have been in denial of for so long why
would you call the product risen because
let's face it it is not rising it is
risen why would you call it risen that
is an admission that you had fallen
somewhere how many people are going to
be disappointed about that anyway from
the look of things there's nothing to be
disappointed about spec wise so we've
got Tom here we go where's the
information on this page here we go
so the key info is here 8 cores 16
threads 3.4 gigahertz plus they've done
some comparisons they've done some demos
that lead us to believe it is something
similar to Broadwell in terms of the
performance per clock which would make
this a very compelling CPU if it comes
in at the right kind of price 20 Meg's
of level 2 and level 3 cache an extended
frequency range so some kind of turbo
boost or like GPU boost like technology
that will reward users who are cooling
the CPU well fully automated apparently
with no user intervention required which
is pretty cool ok so a bunch of caching
stuff tatatatatada temperature speed and
voltage monitoring it adaptively
controls all of that stuff in real time
for lower power usage so that's cool
fine green frequency control boost I
mean the reality of it is there's not a
whole lot to say about a CPU other than
that like yes it's fast and it's power
efficient so as long as you've got that
stuff nailed down then if the price is
right then you've got my attention here
we go the am4 platform this honestly is
more out of date than AMD's existing
CPUs from a purely performance
standpoint that note sorry am for is not
am3+ was I mean it was still PCI Express
2.0 for crying out loud AMD has been
building
gpus designed to work best on an Intel
platform for like three four years now
like a long long time so finally AMD is
bringing the platform up to date ddr4
and it looks like we're going to get
four slots there so dual-channel ddr2
look of things PCI Express gen3 USB 3.1
gen2 so 10 Gigabit USB nvme SATA Express
I guess I am Dee didn't get the memo
when they were working on am for that
SATA Express is completely dead in the
water but that's ok that's ok they're
still not going to have Intel exclusive
technologies like Thunderbolt but I mean
this is this is actually almost an
entirely separate discussion for when
show does Thunderbolt matter much and
you can look at you can look at a
variety of different indicators that
tell us what industry leaders think of
Thunderbolt
so Apple equipped the latest MacBook Pro
with anywhere from 2 to on most SKUs for
Thunderbolt 3 ports but they also did
this in a way that to me indicates that
they don't they were just trying to give
their users the the utmost in
expandability and flexibility moving
forward in terms of what they can plug
into those ports because their type-c
ports that support USB 3.1 gen2 so
that's 10 Gigabit Thunderbolt 3 so
that's 40 gigabit as well as hdmi
displayport all that stuff so the idea
was just like the ultimate versatility
like simplifying life for the Mac user
just you plugged your power you plug in
your display you plug anything into this
and boopity Boppity black it just works
except for one thing
Apple apparently didn't think the actual
fun durable three functionality was
important enough to bother to have their
laptop work with any Thunderbolt three
devices that are on the market I don't
know if you guys have been paying
attention to this but go shop for a
Thunderbolt 3 peripheral that's
certified to work on the MacBook Pro you
won't find one and the reason for that
and I cover this in my MacBook Pro
review which is coming to YouTube I
think sometime next week something like
that anyway my MacBook Pro review is
coming but I cover this and all the
Thunderbolt 3 devices out there right
now are running a first-generation Texas
Instruments chipset for USB power
delivery and all that nonsense and Apple
specifically locked out any devices
using that first-generation chipset from
working in OS 10 Sierra on the MacBook
Pro so you can you can boot windows you
can boot camp into Windows and you can
run a razor core or we've gotten a kitty
o external drive enclosure that works
just fine you plug it in an OS 10
nothing it doesn't even give you an
error it's not even like oh hey so we're
a bunch of like butt heads and we
decided not to validate for that older
controller
I suspect there's a reason it might have
to do with the because it's out like
it's a power management like it's a
power delivery circuit of some sort like
it manages its it might have something
to do with the way that the MacBook
charges on any of the ports or something
or it could have something to do with
the fact that I believe it also handles
USB connectivity and it only handles USB
3.1 gen
it was like for the most seamless
possible experience everything that
works in this port is 10 Gigabit USB 3
or definite I don't know I'm trying to
find a reason for them but maybe Phil
Schiller will post somewhere he'll talk
to the verge and he'll say Linus is an
idiot he got it wrong there's a thousand
reasons why this makes perfect
but it works in Windows and it doesn't
even bother to give you an error message
in OS 10 so so what this means what I'm
coming back to is Apple apparently
thought it was important enough to put
on their laptop but didn't think it was
important enough for there to actually
be any Thunderbolt devices that plug
into it for like weeks after the launch
and maybe maybe they weren't wrong
because I was looking I was actually
trying to find some Thunderbolt 3 docks
because I wanted to do like a roundup or
something on Amazon and that was when I
realized there was this whole issue
because I couldn't find any and what I
realized was 99% of anything I could
possibly want to do on a laptop even
high-speed external storage at 10
gigabit I mean we're talking one
gigabyte per second there's nothing 8k
red footage doesn't require more than
one gigabyte per second to a nice high
performance USB type-c SSD there's
nothing that requires this and why would
you want to plug anything into it that
wasn't first party Macintosh anyways
really you came onto the show to
contribute that why are you even here
what why even bought bringing the
hardcore arguments ok so anyway
everything else so there's my my dongle
but it's not in my bag because I was
actually doing something on the the
MacBook just a minute ago but I've got a
dongle that does SD micro SD HDMI 3 USB
3.0 s nothing's actually sweet and power
in pass-through and I'm sitting here
going so that's like all the i/o that I
would have already had on like a laptop
that has i/o just like that and I've got
and I've got three more yeah Plus this
doesn't even have an SD card reader or
even it and I've got three oh yeah it
has Ethernet - it's a really cool
adapter I'm gonna have a video coming
anyway and I've got three more that I
can plug in like a Type C to DisplayPort
or a type C to another DisplayPort BAM
now I've got dual external on and I've
still got one more so what do I actually
need
Thunderbolt three four and so I guess
Apple kind of had the same thought is
like what what is this actually for what
ninety-nine I would even say point five
percent of users are ever going to plug
into a MacBook Pro is handled just fine
by USB so bringing it all the way back
to AMD's platform not having support for
Thunderbolt three does that matter
remains to be seen but I would speculate
that it will only affect some very very
nice edge cases and most people won't
care the main one for me on a laptop is
support for an external GPU because I
think that's the future as the price
comes down for those external GPU
enclosures I mean alien wares is only a
couple hundred bucks and make it less
screwed up a lot more reasonable and the
inter compatibility gets way better that
to me is how people are gonna game in
the future it's just like we're not
there yet so in total yeah you think
everyone's going to be on laptops with
external GPUs I think to make a
prediction like everyone will do
anything would be shooting myself in the
foot right cuz someone's garage
percentage someone's gonna find this
clip yeah yeah maybe even not a large
percent of a percentage of people for a
long time cuz you got to think about the
upgrade cycle right like people aren't
going to want to just throw out a
perfectly functional computer and the
rate at which CPU performance is
increasing there's a lot of very
perfectly functional computers that are
three four years old at this point but I
think and especially looking at skylake
versus KB Lake the performance increase
we're seeing even on the laptop side of
things I think people are going to start
to think about in the next two to three
years gee this laptop I have is like
still pretty darn good I just wish I
could game on it and those are going to
get cheaper and they're going to go this
makes a ton of sense and people are
going to start to invest in it
a lot of gaming on his laptop already
mmm-hmm so it's an interesting and like
with with blades being able to play like
pretty much kind of everything yeah it's
an interesting idea alright so um there
you guys have it risen or rising you
know what I am stubbornly calling it the
Titan XP forever I think I'm going to
stubbornly call it risen forever I think
I think I'm going to commit to that so
you guys let me know in twitch chat if
you if you if you hate that but I don't
think any of you will I think you guys
are probably going to be with me on this
one alright what other important topics
do we have today the iPhone 6s
reportedly explodes post charging the
original article here is from yahoo.com
that is a super big bummer for Nick
light who just bought my old iPhone 6s
off me
what a loser and it's pink
ah oh I hate that guy um so what up what
do we got in here apple announced that
it will be releasing an iOS update next
week that will allow them to better
diagnose any battery issues on December
6 reports of exploding iPhones surfaced
in China you know we do have to of
course you know take this with a grain
of salt because there have been cases of
exploding iPhones in the past that and
again I'm making up statistics on the
spot but it seems to me that well over
half of them have been caused by
unauthorized third-party chargers that
we're doing a bad job of managing apples
you know proprietary battery management
algorithm nonsense so let's kind of keep
an eye on this but allegedly the
shanghai consumer council has received
eight separate reports of iphones
exploding adding that it had seen a big
rise in the number of complaints against
iphones in the past two months on friday
and iphone success started spewing
immediately after it with unplug from
charging them went up in
flames I'm assuming smoke is missing
from that sentence in my notes Apple
blames the problem on ambient air during
the manufacturing process said the
problem is limited to a small number of
iPhone 6's devices manufactured between
September and October 2015
ugly it's not the pink 128 gig one's
moving on to our next topic this one was
originally posted by dat speed on the
forum Facebook is now partnering with
fact checkers to stop fake news the
original article here is from the verge
and basically they're they're creating
some new tools for reporting hoaxes and
as much as they've denied any
responsibility for having any kind of
effect on the outcome of the 2016 US
election it seems as though internally
at least they are taking very seriously
what others are alleging and that is
that they did have an effect so in a
nutshell here's what they're doing
they've got tools that are designed to
make it easier to report links shared in
the newsfeed as fake news and they're
working with four independent
fact-checking organizations to assess
the accuracy of viral stories snopes
politifact ABC News and factcheck.org
Facebook users who share a story that's
been marked as false will be warned that
independent fact checkers have disputed
its accuracy Facebook will use a variety
of signals to identify stories that are
likely to be false so this includes
stories that people post but later
delete and also includes lots of
comments about them being fake they will
use these and other signals to populate
a dashboard of dubious stories and
fact-checking partners will get access
to the dashboard
they will then investigate the articles
claims and market as disputed and linked
to their own article debunking it if at
least two fact-checking organizations
mark a story as disputed users will
begin seeing a
and are under the article if it appears
in their newsfeed and we've got a
picture of what that banner would look
like so here we go and you just blow
that up for you guys disputed by
third-party fact-checkers ah what else
is going on here yeah so Facebook's
product management lead Adam maseri said
they are focusing their efforts on the
worst of the worst clear hoaxes spread
by spammers for their own gain they also
said they're doing more to eliminate
financial incentives behind fake news so
will also prevent publishers that you
spoof domains like BuzzFeed feed calm or
ABC News comm Co from buying ads on the
platform so honestly I don't know how
much of an effect this will have you
know the how do I put this
I'm trying to stay more apolitical on
the show so certain people seem to be
impervious to here I'll put it in quotes
facts presented by outlets that they
have been convinced somehow are out to
lie to them about everything and you
know what depending on which way your
political leanings go you could
interpret that from either side so I
think I've stayed fairly safe here but
basically it's a it's it's it's a
well-established phenomena that's going
on right now phenomenon yeah it's all
just one that there are these echo
chambers on the right and the left and
that no one seems to even even if sort
of a untrustworthy news source on one
side or the other were to say something
that was factual there's this inherent
distrust that exists so I sincerely
doubt that any kind of warning under an
article in a news feed would really do
much of anything
to cause the reader to not believe it
and if anything I think this is just
going to create anger towards Facebook
for being part of the left-wing liberal
media dishonest whatever or the other
side as it were if there are fake
stories that you know if someone's feed
is just full of a bunch of stuff that
Facebook's flagging is news as or as
fake and they trust all these news
sources I think it's going to create
distrust towards Facebook as opposed to
the other way around but I would love to
be wrong about this so yeah yeah got a
lot twitch chat twitch chat is wow
twitch chat is not encouraging me
they are basically they're basically
going yep sounds about right
people are going to believe what they
want to believe so there's that yeah
we've got people saying hey if it's if
it's worthy of being flagged as clearly
fake it should be removed but then
you're going to have you know the the
free speech the people who don't quite
understand the difference between the
right to free speech and the right to
say whatever you want in a private forum
you're going to have those people
raising heck and and all that stuff so
this is a great question what about the
onion um you know now it's a great
question like I personally probably
wouldn't click on a satirical news story
like something that the onion would
produce if it was flagged as fake news
do they classify satire separately could
fake news outlets hide behind satire
these are all great questions and this
is a very this is a very this is very
challenging water that Facebook is
heading into I'm glad they're doing
something
but I really think they're going to have
a hard time finding a middle ground that
doesn't work many many of their users I
mean the good news for Facebook is
they're in a position of power to do
something like this where what else is
there
they're basically a social network
monopoly it's like out of a hundred
friends you know ten of them might have
whatsapp three of them might have Google
Hangouts fifteen of them might have
Twitter and I'm making up these numbers
don't quote me on these numbers but like
ninety five of them probably have
Facebook even if they don't use it super
regularly so there you go it's like it's
like the modern white pages it's like
you probably are listed on Facebook
unless you like specifically went out of
your way to contact the white pages and
you know get your number removed
basically like that people like we want
Luke they want you Luke so that's one
thing I have in common with our viewers
you're just going to step in and
contribute something completely
worthless to my topic once again is that
what you have to know I'm not talking
about anything I'm not talking about
anything we don't forget it
Isis I'm talking about Facebook no I'm
not is website can you not bump the
table and knock everything over other
thing - tech tips comm that has ever
been created the best the best they have
the best but also I heard that Colonel
mortis made Facebook he's the CEO I
think that's why Linus tech tips is the
only website that's better because he

restarting the computer took for ever 2
minutes and 13 seconds to be exact go
from clicking the restart button to
having Firefox up on the Linus tech tips
page and it did really get much better
from there block loading boxes took a
very long time to the point where I was
worried that it wasn't a function at all
steam I was actually 100% convincing
failing all the way in shitless
restarting the computer took forever
from pressing the restart button to
having Firefox loaded with the last exit
homepage on it took 2 minutes and 13 I
could also go on ASMR on this baby hold
a whole topic like this okay Crytek is
sinking which is unpaid talent leaving
the original poster for this was Patrick
JP 93 on the forum now there have been
rumors swirling around Crytek makers of
Far Cry Crysis Crysis do crisis theory
and cryogen I'm pretty sure they did
other things too but there's at least
that going for them about there being
all kinds of instability wages unpaid
they've denied it and denied it and
denied it and things had actually
returned to stability until I'm talking
about something else what out of here
what so things had been financially
stable at Crytek until June of this year
around that time Crytek's frankfurt
office discovered that they weren't
going to be paid on time the upper
management ensured employees that all
financial problems would be worked out
by August 2016 and that there would be
enough money to remain stable for at
least 18 months payroll was two weeks
late for July and August September came
and payroll was five weeks late wages
for October and November have yet to be
paid December's pay is due in about
three weeks time kick guru reports that
their source says there has been no
indication of financial issues until
June of this year but those still at the
Frankfurt office have submitted a legal
letter to management
informing them that if wages for October
November and December aren't paid in
full by the end of next week they will
stop working those that the Budapest
Studio have apparently already stopped
turning up to work the company has about
700 employees though it's hard to say if
they actually have those employees if
they aren't paying them if I stopped
paying you guys would I still have you
thanks for that Buerkle I wasn't for
linus Media Group - Media Group accepts
no responsibility for any of that all
right um Oh sponsors I gotta talk
sponsors right now Squarespace
Squarespace is the place to go if you
think that websites are places can a
website be a place sort of okay so web
sites web space webspace Squarespace is
the place to go on the Internet if you
want to build yourself a
fantastic-looking web site and do it on
the cheap on the easy and on the fast
yes my friends cheap fast and easy those
are definitely not the talking points
that are in my my document here but
that's okay
sometimes I go off script and sometimes
I don't get fired
Squarespace lets you pick from any one
of their beautiful templates basically
plunk in some text and some images
rearrange some stuff it's all done
through like a cloud web interface you
can set up a store you can set up like a
one-page presence in like a matter of
minutes you can your favorite waited
logo designer no it's actually not my
point is that you can tweet not that you
should - gee Sebastian so his personal
account you should flood his personal
account why are you doing this - with
one-page websites that you think are
just the best it'll basically be like
his greatest the greatest yeah the best
web sites you have actually contributed
like in a below-zero manner to the
quality of today's show speaker which
and this is a show that had no audio in
the intro and audio only in the lab
channel for the first four minutes
speaker boot that is where you're at
today I think you should do the rest of
this bonus about - ASMR no you can't
because then that would bring up my
audio tubing that would suck okay I'm
waiting after you a pick up thing but
it's good okay I'm here now so
Squarespace has got me it's available to
anyone who wants to spend a few bucks a
month anybody and have a great website
and it's got a responsive design so it
works on your phone tablet and on your
laptop consoles and on you yeah I guess
there's no reason it wasn't probably a
Nintendo DS so when you sign up for
Squarespace make sure to use offer code
when to get 10% off your first purchase
and if all of you do it right now after
watching this sponsorship spot then
maybe you won't have to listen to these
Squarespace spots ever again because
whenever we do them in the future no new
people will sign up because everyone in
our audience will already have a
Squarespace website think about that for
a moment and go sign up for Squarespace
today it's a trick because you I got you
that's actually how that would work
though it's like yeah Linus you know I
mean it's great yeah one really good day
and now we're just not gonna pay you
anymore yeah cuz you're clearly done
yeah everyone on earth has a Squarespace
website now so the gigs up this effort
has going to be done alright um let's

the place to go if you want to repair
your electronics phones tablets
all-in-ones monitors even they've got
all kinds of amazing quality guides for
how to fix your stuff getting more life
out of it instead of paying someone else
to fix it or getting rid of it and
they've got the all new I fix it
essential electronics toolkit which my
personal vana over here is showing you
guys
doesn't have all the stuff that they're
protec toolkit does which I love by the
way I love protec toolkit it doesn't
have as many bits it doesn't have as
many pry tools it doesn't have as many
you know it doesn't all it doesn't have
the new screwdriver which really is a
lot better than the old screwdriver
though the old ones like it's not
terrible it's just the new one really is
a lot better but it is a lot cheaper it
only costs 20 bucks and with offer code
when show you can save 5 bucks off a
purchase of $10 or more so you can get

phones really and it's got their ESD
safe tweezers the only one that I ever

with our offer cool way can do this
better myself
it's certainly smaller stuff no okay I
need you to get some are fine you got to
get real close up for Nick hey I found a
guitar pick you the prison thank you
I'm here for you Western Digital is
announcing high-capacity 12 terabyte and
14 terabyte helium-filled hard drives
the original article here is extreme
tech calm and oh I am not in the corner
of that anymore but don't worry about it
this ads gonna go away pretty freakin
fantastic
so the 12 terabyte is an 8 freaking
platter design 8 platters in there and
the 14 terabyte is a shingled magnetic
recording design so the 12 terabyte is
going to actually perform significantly
better but like holy crap
I have spent some time with Seagate's
archive drives which are also shingled
magnetic recording drives and they're
like actually not that bad for archival
use and 14 terabytes per disk would mean
that in something like a store an ATAR
60 I mean what is that freaking math
work out to you'd be able to put it so
60 drives 60 drives you'd be able to put
60 terabytes plus another 40 percent of
that so that would be another 12 so
you'd be able to put 72 freakin
terabytes in a single store inator XL 60
Wow
unreal I mean never mind it being
absolutely terrifying that if one of
your drives dies like if you are
actually using these in a desktop that
you could lose anywhere from 12 to 14
terabytes of data but of course that's
just the usual very strong argument for
not just redundancy but backups so there
you go um yeah I guess that's pretty
much all there is to say about that
Amazon's first prime air Dilla can I
talk louder
Amazon's first prime air delivery has
happened it's official it was posted by
pig hammer on the forum the original
article here is from kit goo
Ruta net and here it is it happened
December 7th 2016 fully autonomous hold
on let me mute that volume there it's a
two-minute video so I'm not going to
watch the whole thing but like blah blah
blah there's some footage blah blah blah
something something fire TV of course
they ordered a fire TV because they
wanted one of those
and there's a drone when there's
presumably another drone taking videos
of the drones that drone while you drone
so you can drone will you drone
fulfilled there it isn't yard Wow
frickin future man freaking future I am
like super excited about this like super
excite anyone outside of a fairly dense
urban center I'd imagine this isn't
going to benefit them for quite some
time but then the idea of not just from
like a consumer standpoint of it would
sure be cool if I could order crap under
two kilograms crap under two kilograms
and so there's two customers taking
place in the trial right now due to the
fact that they live close enough to the
fulfillment center so as long as you
live close enough to a fulfillment
center in your order is under two
kilograms I'm super excited to be able
to receive stuff within like potentially
hours or even minutes of ordering it
because that's like super amazing as a
consumer but I am also excited from just
a like an efficiency standpoint I mean
compared to sending a truck to your
house to deliver like a pack of
batteries like think about the
efficiency of being able to use a little
electrically powered device to do the
last the last mile because there's a
huge variety of ways that they could
deploy this like Amazon could just have
a truck kind of drive out to some you
know intelligently you know determined
optimized point and you know kind of
like in Phantom Menace sorry I shouldn't
be talking about Phantom
- we all agreed not to talk about that
movie I'm sorry
anyway like in that movie where the the
droids like slide out of the back of the
tank thing and they like deploy and then
they don't deploy in the air because
they're walking droids because you know
for some reason they thought that would
be a good idea anyway there's there's a
hundred different ways that they could
make it so that delivery to people's
homes could be less environmentally
impactful and just generally more
efficient than it is today using this
kind of technology so that is super
duper exciting I mean yeah you look at
the more traditional way of getting
goods and it is inherently more
efficient than having a distribution hub
and then vehicles driving out like a
like a spoken-- wheel type system out
from there to drop-off to individual
customers because you would carry you
know pallets at a time of stuff like
milk for example so while yes the
consumer is effectively doing the same
thing where they are driving their
individual car to and from like some
kind of a hub they are picking up more
than one thing at a time and they're
usually like if they're if they're
clever consumers they're consolidating
their trips so the grocery store gets a
consolidated large shipment of eggs or
milk or whatever the case may be and
then the consumer comes in buys eggs and
milk and you know this weird little
container in the shape of a goldfish
cracker that fits goldfish crackers in
it because his kids wouldn't shut up
about it and they wanted it so badly and
it was only like three dollars not that
I'm speaking about from personal
experience on that last one all right
twitch introduces Auto mod a self
learning moderation tool so this was
posted on the forum by Novus ball and
the original article is from kit
guru.com
and they are going to be using machine
learning to help police chat this has
got to be one of the best things that
I've seen come out of the Amazon
acquisition of twitch so
our we have actually put a fair bit of
work into our own moderation bot and it
is baffling to me that twitch had not
invested in this kind of thing before
so Auto mod will be a chatbot that uses
machine learning and natural language
processing to police chat rooms it is
not entirely intended to replace human
moderators and twitch lines tagline for
the announcement is moderators are the
sword Auto mod is the shield which is
super lame it is lame
so twitch notes that streamers can
configure Auto mod by selecting one of
four different levels so these levels
affect how aggressively Auto mod holds
back messages under four categories
identity sexual language aggressive
speech and profanity when Auto mod Flags
a message it lets the original sender
know that moderators will review the
messages contents before it's sent to
chat meanwhile the message is shown to
mods for approval so yes
their slogan makes sense it's just lame
that's all and we can agree to disagree
on this if you want speaking of twitch
and streaming this is kind of a big deal
I mean League of Legends is getting
reported on in the Wall Street Journal
League of Legends eSports contests lure
newest fan Major League Baseball $0.10
Riot Games in a 300 million dollar deal
with MLB unit to stream competitive
video gaming so now Major League
Baseball and the NBA are getting
involved in big league gaming so BAM
Tech was spun into its own company from
Major League Baseball and Disney as well
as the National Hockey League
oh sorry from Major League Baseball
Disney as well as the National Hockey
League own a part of it according to The
Wall Street Journal the agreement calls
for BAM tech to pay a minimum 300
million through 2023 to Riot Games
in return they'll get exclusive rights
to stream and monetize the company's
popular multiplayer online battle arena
game Bamm Tech plans to launch a league
of Legends streaming service with apps
for smartphones PCs and other devices
they will also handle distribution on
existing streaming portals like twitch
and YouTube gaming Wow
unreal holy actual freakin crap
speaking of unreal holy actual freakin
crap Microsoft is bringing Cortana to
fridges toasters and thermostats so just
in case you were thinking that you
needed to be able to talk to your
toaster you will be able to do that soon
assuming you get some kind of supported
device though to be perfectly honest and
I would I would love to hear from you
guys in the twitch chat on this I have
never been compelled to replace an
appliance for any reason other than my
old one broke are you guys on the same
page with me here like is anyone going
like yeah I like super duper need that
but what what could I possibly want my
oven to do other than what it does
already like five years from now what if
you could leave a bag of popcorn in your
microwave before you go to work and then
you walk into your door and just say hey
microwave make that popcorn and it's
just ready in in two minutes
why would you want to pre-heat your oven
before your home but by the time you've
finished preparing the thing that goes
in the oven it's already preheated not
not if it's a frozen pizza boom you guys
are giving me so much cancer right now
um so so okay thermostat fine
intelligent thermostat sure but honestly
it's going to be the same problem as it
always is we're like you've got your
nest thermostat already because you're
the kind of tech junky that buys
Internet of Things devices you've got
your Lynas lock which is a thing by the
way you've got your you know odd Samsung
smart fridge that you can bet your
bottom dollar they're not going to care
about putting curtain on and then you've
got your Cortana toaster and none of it
is going to work together at all so it's
just stupid and pointless so five 10
years from now when everyone gets over
their egos and there's actually some
kind of cohesive ecosystem I'm still
calling it the iHome okay where Apple
just does the whole thing themselves
then you'll have my attention but for
now and like okay and like when a smart
fridge comes out that actually has like
cameras all over the inside that keeps
track of like like not just cameras like
it needs to be able to like scan my milk
my milk carton and know how full it is
and stuff like when that fridge exists
I'm down but until then I super don't
care and neither do a lot of people um
all right
this is great so this was originally
posted by up no one on the forum the
original article hears from Mac rumors
Apple will apparently charge sixty nine
dollars to replace um hold on a second
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah here
we go so battery service will be
forty-nine dollars each on air pods out
of warranty 69 dollars each and if you
lose an air pod they will charge 69
dollars which is only slightly less than
half of the price of air pods in the
first place if I recall correctly though
I haven't actually gone and bought them
yet and I don't remember because I am an
idiot so let's go ahead no I don't want
Apple dot CA no one knows Canadian
dollars so if I talk about things in
terms of Canadian dollars I'm just
shooting myself in the foot I thought
they were one foot another 159 okay so
it's still only a little less than half
of one um yeah what is there to say
about it other than that I guess I will
be reviewing the air pods so they went
on sale Tuesday morning the earliest I'm
able to get them is Sunday Apple stores
in Canada are going to get them so I'm
actually I'm coming in on Sunday
Burkle's coming in on Sunday Tyler's
going to be helping us out and we are
going to be slamming together so I've
already got all of my other wireless
headphones like charged up firmware
updated ready to rock I've got the
braggy - I've got the j-bird freedoms
and then I've got some regular ear pods
with the lightning connector and I'm
going to be whipping together a video
for you guys that's going to be coming
out on Sunday I can already I've never
heard them before but I'm pretty sure I
can already tell you how it goes they're
expensive
they sound like okay I guess they don't
stay in your ears as well as some other
solutions and I don't personally feel
like the the absence of a cable in
between them contributes much to the
experience but if you want to watch that
again but longer with Glam footage then
sunday will be the time
yes sir a video on installing Windows
there's an NCIX tech tips so you could
do that all right
oh this is exciting posted on the forum
by dat speed LG is taking a 4k HDR
monitor with USB C to CES HDR is coming
finally
so AMD has got support for HDR I
actually don't know about NVIDIA as HDR
status there's no more time again no
content want to add some more but yeah
yeah I'm doing it alright there's
there's like no content um actually my
4k blu-ray is it worth it video is
coming to YouTube very soon as well
should be a really good video if you're
interested in HDR but in a nutshell 4k
blu-ray does not run on a PC so there's
there's really other than content
creation I guess there's really not much
reason to care about HDR on the PC but
damn it it's coming and I'm going to be
trying to get one of these from LG like
ASAP because I think it would be
flipping bananas to have like flow
playing club now with better streaming
quality than YouTube and with HDR which
nobody will be using also actually oh
this is another very important
announcement for you guys it's official
as of today we are going red we were
looking at our looking at our accounting
books
it's almost year-end so this is the time
for us to make any kinds of you know key
investments but Tom we had an internal
meeting and we kind of went okay
we've got some equipment budget left
over this year let's talk about some
stuff we need to do so we're going to be
changing up the LTTE set and we are it
came up that a big mission for us is to
have flow plane club streaming quality
be better than any other streaming video
quality on the web and we kind of went
okay how are we going to achieve that
shooting on a Sony fs5 so sometime in
mid January our order will arrive we
will be getting two red cameras a red
weapon with 8k sensor and a red epic W
we are going to be getting new lenses
and we are we going to be going full-on
sharpest possible image quality so get
excited guys we've got we used to kind
of keep up with the rat race that is the
whole like you know let's be the first
ones to 4k and let's get an external
recorder and let's do this and let's do
that but we'd allowed ourselves to fall
behind a little bit and we are not going
to let that happen anymore we're moving
into a red eco system so stay tuned for
that guys it is going to be a bit of a
learning curve for us but it is going to
result in some seriously sharp looking
videos all right
is there much else that's important here
oh he's still going oopsie so the
Microsoft Surface hub was originally
posted by Ali's ad 2000 on the forum the
original article here is from ARS
technica let's go ahead and pop that up
but the surprise Hardware hit the
surface hub apparently the conference
room computer
is now a billion-dollar business are you
freaking kidding me I saw this thing I
went wow that's a really cool
proof-of-concept that's pretty neat I
didn't think they'd actually sell that
many of them it went on sale earlier
this year so the conference room
computer it's the surface range of
touchscreen computers is getting a whole
lot bigger the surface hub is it's like
an all-in-one system so it has OneNote
Skype for business office and Universal
windows apps and it puts in the
conference room it's a single integrated
device they first showed it off in
January it includes dual 1080p cameras
for video conferencing they run a
special version of Windows 10 the big
one supports an 84-inch 120 Hertz 3840
by 2160 screen packs of 4th generation
intel core i7 paired with an nvidia
quadro k 2200 graphics card and the
smaller one is 55 inch 120 hertz 1080p
uses a core i5 they both 128 K SSDs 8
gigs of RAM they don't just replace a
whiteboard but a projector as well and
both of them work as miracast receivers
and have HDMI and VGA inputs as well so
tell me something do you guys want to
see a review of a surface hub like we
looked at it we went no they're not sure
that's kind of neat but like we never
even thought to request one and we've
actually got a surface studio one of
only what is it for in the country two
in the country and Luke's working on a
review of that right now and hey well
not like right now right now he's doing
it right now I'm on but soon Ryan show
but soon and maybe a great follow up to
that would be the surface hub yes so
thanks for tuning in to the wind show
you guys uh we will see you again next
one quick thing before we go did you see

tech cookie that I linked here we talked
about chip cards and the security that
comes with chip cards and the idea that
someone might put a cover on the card
reader that skims your card when it goes
through I'm pretty sure I hosted that
one who the hell installed that and in
this situation they went even more
hardcore
and stopped like essentially an entire
ATM on top of the one that was there how
would anybody not notice I was zooming
that looks like some crazy like foam
seal thing at the top what the heck just
walked in and just unbelievable isn't
