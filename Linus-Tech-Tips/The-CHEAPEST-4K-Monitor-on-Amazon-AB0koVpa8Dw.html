you just couldn't handle spending
hundreds or even thousands of dollars on
a freaking computer screen well have we
ever got a deal for you as long as you
don't need high refresh rate HDR 10-bit
color free sync g-sync are sexy RGB
lighting then this right here is the
sector you 27 the cheapest 4k monitor on
Amazon at just a hundred and seventy
nine bucks but is it any good well I
wouldn't be able to tell you if it
wasn't for our sponsor story blocks
story blocks offers you studio quality
stock video clips for a fraction of the
cost
check it out today at the link in the
video description
all right so James over there has
actually seen this already but I haven't
so this is gonna be my first time
unboxing just how much monitor you can
get for a hundred and eighty bucks I'll
tell you you're not going to get a lot
of packaging so I mean it should be fine
as long as you PS doesn't you know
dropkick it or anything that's why it's
got built-in speakers so that's not bad
although my expectations are pretty low
in terms of what kind of sweet
Wow you get a metal stand I wasn't
really expecting that I was expecting it
to be pretty low plastic all right
that's cool
included accessories you got your screws
you got your other more different screws
you got your driver of screws also known
as a screw driver one HDMI cable one
pretty skinny power cord but that's fine
I guess huh I guess they didn't need a
third ground prong for this for some
reason and some other more different
screws you also get the monitor itself
we have come to the point where even
literally the cheapest displays are
super thin with narrow bezels these days
2018 is a great time to be alive isn't
it look at that oh thank god I mean if
it wasn't compatible with Windows 10
whatever would I do the craziest thing
about this sticker is that that doesn't
happen by accident someone somewhere
went out of their way to obtain reams
upon reams of these stickers and find
some way to work into the workflow of
producing this monitor that they get
applied to them who made that call base
screw hanging screws so these are first
for if you're facing mounting it okay
that's cool that is actually a really
nice inclusion that's one of the ways
that conventional you know the monitor
brands you've ever heard of tend to
differentiate their low-end products is
they don't allow them to be mounted on a
third party arm well this is a serious
advantage for this one it's always been
something that's kind of triggered me
because it doesn't cost them really
anything to put four freaking holes
there is it not even the worst
screwdriver I've ever encountered and
basically for free you probably to know
which way the stand goes on though so
there's these convenient rubber feet on
the bottom of the metal stand I got to
say the iOS a little better than I
expected so we've got two HDMI ports
though you should note and they've
marked this very clearly one of them is
only HDMI 1.4 so it doesn't have the
latest HDCP as well 4k
thirty Hertz and it won't be able to
play the latest protected content one of
the Mo's HDMI 2.0 hdcp 2.2 4k 60 Hertz
has also got DisplayPort and DVI
curiously along with a headphone jack
now you're not gonna get like a USB hub
or anything like that but frankly at
this price you shouldn't be expecting
that moment of truth
scepter worst peal ever it should be
illegal to ship monitors with stickers
that not only are just completely
superfluous but also cover the screen
let's go ahead and have a look at the at
the menu here so we've got our they
could they've committed a cardinal sin
here they've put buttons on the back
without labels on the front so we're
just kind of just kind of guessing here
overdrive is on just does nothing
because they do not think no nevermind I
just said wrong blue light shift so you
can it's kind of like a reading mode now
that we're running at 60 Hertz my
immediate impressions are pretty good
like there's no obvious like oh wow this
is really you know pretty crap input leg
or dang can we actually cut the lights
do you guys remember when every cheap
monitor had like the grossest TN panel
and just like epic amounts of backlight
bleed along the sides like this is not
bad like obviously you get a bit of that
IPS glow but frankly that's never really
bothered me and you know the stands not
amazing you know it has height adjust in
the sense that you can put
put it okay that's until let's get this
no better than nothing
so next up here is how suitable with
this thing be for gaming well frankly
there's a fair amount of motion blur
there it's possible that we could
actually bump the refresh rate someone
on reddit apparently reported getting as
high as seventy one Hertz on this thing
I don't know if I'm necessarily gonna
aim that oh whoa I have not seen that
before
okay so your mileage may vary this
worked but is clearly a terrible
experience you want to get it close to
that Brennan so they can really they can
really have the experience here yeah
look at this Razer logo it's alive
squirming like a snake alright so we're
gonna call it quits on the display
overclocking at this point but you know
almost fire up again it's fire up csgo
those are not great speakers at three
watts I mean I wasn't expecting much but
those are quite bad this is actually a
lot better in terms of responsiveness
than I was expecting
let's start the game's not rendering
like that it's just so I'm just moving
it around like this like I mean
obviously it's not a you know 240 Hertz
gaming monitor or whatever but like it
doesn't feel like oh my god I SOG
the thing is that if you're spending a
hundred and eighty dollars on your
display like running 4k has inherent
problems because you probably aren't
spending enough on your PC that you can
comfortably game at 4k sixty but if you
happen to be hooked up to something that
can game at 4k sixty this is not a
terrible experience so the last real
question mark for us then is color
accuracy and thankfully James has
actually run it through our gamut of
tests using the I 1 Pro from X right
here and in terms of results this is far
from amazing so a delta e of seven is
well within the range that it would be a
noticeable difference to the eye but
it's not the worst we've seen for sure
and let's actually check out our gamut
test here and with ninety percent
coverage of srgb
like with calibration yeah you wouldn't
be doing any serious photo or you know
video work on it but it is more than
usable for casual use you're not gonna
you're not gonna notice like oh yeah red
is pink or anything like that
I consider this very acceptable
considering the price of this display
now with all that said something that
you're gonna run up against with any
kind of value monitor these days is that
you might be getting sort of the reject
from a more reputable factory so though
the word on the street is that these are
using cast-off samsung panels which to
be clear that's actually a pretty good
thing even a B Samsung panel is not it
gonna make for a terrible display but
you're more likely to run into things
like this so we actually have a dead
pixel on ours right about yeah to see
that black spot right there sometimes
you can actually kind of massage them
out
it looks like that is not going to be
happening the good news is that at 4k
Ted pixels are actually far less of an
issue than they used to be back when we
were running 1280 by 1024 where you
could like really see them and dead is
better than stuck like if you got like a
like a freaking blue stuck pixel that's
that's quite a lot more noticeable than
this like I probably wouldn't notice
that if I hadn't known it was there I
think it's just like a tiny little piece
of dust or something that's not oh we
got another one yeah actually we've got
we've got a handful we've got one here
got one here got one here that one there
it took me till now to notice them and I
don't think anyone sets their desktop
background like that either though so in
conclusion this thing is actually kind
of fun awesome like I don't know is it
would you put it a different way like at
this price for at least for the unit
we've got which by the way we just
bought so your mileage may vary but like
clearly this can't happen like I'm
impressed as hell hundred eighty bucks
I mean when you compare that to the most
popular bra monitor on Amazon which is
that HP 1080p one yea cost twice as much
but it absolutely blows it out of the
water this thing's great and this video
