backup plus for
a portable drive versus their more
desktop oriented drive the time also
happen to have here now the key
difference between the max keys and the
PC skews is things like color and things
like the included cables because pcs are
generally going to be USB 3 and Max are
generally not going to be USB 3 because
Apple and their infinite wisdom doesn't
believe in USB 3 although they'll
probably change their tune now that
Intel's integrated it onto their
chipsets
you also see so you see things like
firewire 800 included instead of USB 3
although this one looks like it is just
USB 2 so in this case the Mac Edition
the Mac Edition 1 gets the shaft because
it just gets a silver housing which I
guess will look better with your Mac it
is Time Machine compatible though so is
so is anything with you know storage on
it and it is Mac OS compatible but then
again so is anything with storage on it
because it is also windows compatible
and it just comes down to what the
pre-configured formatting is so tiny
pockets social media hah this is cool
though backup plus dry its have software
that not only allow you to easily backup
your computer but also your social media
so they're mostly focused on Facebook
right now hence the Facebook logo on the
back of the drive you can backup all of
the photos that you've already uploaded
to Facebook once you through your
account credentials on here so you can
make sure that it can actually grab them
for you and they're looking at adding
support for additional social media
sites in the future flexible for all
your needs Mac users increase transport
by upgrading to firewire or Thunderbolt
adapter which you can get sold
separately although that Thunderbolt
ones probably pretty pricey however if
you wanted to get the most out of
actually running applications directly
off the driver or whatever the case may
be you probably do want to use
Thunderbolt versus firewire 800 which is
sort of slow QuickStart guide alright
and a very Apple looking Drive here so
we got just like a Seagate logo II think
it's kind of silver on the top kind of
white on the bottom it's just about as
Apple as it gets
silver and white and could it be more
Apple is a trouble I guess they could
put an Apple logo in it but Apple might
get upset they tend not to really like
that just go and like put an apple on
things not that I'm saying Seagate would
want to put an apple logo on their
product in Seagate is a well-respected
brand I don't know why they
putting apple on it that would help my
opinion sorry that was my that was my PC
Gamer had that I was wearing that taking
it off now so anyway we got Seagate logo
thing going on we got a nice aluminum
top so that's for something the PC
version didn't get however they did get
a USB 3 chipset so the good thing about
all of that though is because these are
using the Seagate sort of go flex I
don't know if they still use that I
guess USM is the new branding for it but
whatever it is they use their modular
interfaces out the back which means it's
just to stay to drive in a you know
plastic slash aluminum enclosure and
then all you have to do if you want to
use a different interface with it is a
different interface cable whether it's
Thunderbolt firewire 800 USB doesn't
matter you source a different interface
module plug it into the drive and now
this is a stylish looking like brushed
oh did I say the PC one wasn't metal
well it's not metal stylish brushed
looking you know black slash silver
slash white drive that is now USB 3
ready it's that simple guys because all
of the logic is actually in here not
here this is just a drive and I love
this concept because it has saved my
bacon any number of times when I've gone
compared to traditional solutions which
were that the enclosure had all the
logic built into it and then you had
whatever interfaces you had if you
wanted to have two different interfaces
you have them both you had to have all
the logic you had to spend more on your
drive in order to in order to make sure
that you'd be able to plug it into
whatever you want well I just have a
bunch of these cables lying around these
days and then if I ever run into a
scenario where I'm like oh shoot that
system doesn't support USB 3 but it does
have power T SATA and I want to get the
best performance possible I throw my
power do you see the one on there plug
in my drive and I'm good to go so that
is that is the solution for that and
that's why I like it so look at that
this one also has like a raise like sexy
shiny CDA logo and this one has just
like a flat do you get logo this one
slick or better
shinier it's we're running out of
battery too so I think that pretty much
covers it anyway so thank you for

plus for Mac portable drive and don't
