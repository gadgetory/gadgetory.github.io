backup plus for Mac this is a portable
drive versus their more desktop orion to
drive which i also happen to have here
now the key difference between the max
cues and the pc skus is things like
color and things like the included
cables because pcs are generally going
to be USB 3 and Max are generally not
going to be USB 3 because Apple in their
infinite wisdom doesn't believe in USB 3
although they'll probably change their
tune now that Intel's integrated it on
to their chipsets you also see so you
see things like firewire 800 included
instead of USB 3 although this one looks
like it is just USB 2 so in this case
the mac edition the mac edition one gets
the shaft because it just gets a silver
housing which I guess will look better
with your Mac it is time machine
compatible though so is so is anything
with you know storage on it and it is
mac OS compatible but then again so is
anything with storage on it because it
is also windows compatible and it just
comes down to what the pre-configured
formatting is so tournament pumpkin
social media ha this is cool though
backup plus drives have software that
not only allow you to easily back up
your computer but also your social media
so they're mostly focused on facebook
right now hence the facebook logo on the
back of the drive you can backup all of
the photos that you've already uploaded
to facebook once you through your
account credentials on here so you can
make sure that it can actually grab them
for you and they're looking at adding
support for additional social media
sites in the future flexible for all you
needs Mac users increase transfer it by
upgrading to firewire or Thunderbolt
adapter which you can get sold
separately although that Thunderbolt
one's probably pretty pricey however if
you wanted to get the most out of
actually running applications directly
off the drive or whatever the case may
be you probably do want to use
Thunderbolt nurses firewire 800 which is
sort of slow quick start guide alright
and a very Apple looking drive here so
we got just like a seagate logo ething
it's kind of silver on the top kind of
white on the bottom which is about as
Apple as it gets silver and white you
could it be more Apple official
I guess they could put an apple logo but
Apple might get upset they tend not to
really like that just go and like put an
apple on things not that I'm saying
seagate we want to put an apple logo on
their product in seagate is a
well-respected brand I don't know why
they'd go a lot putting apple on it that
wouldn't help my opinion um sorry that
was my I was my pc gamer had that I was
wearing that taking it off now um so
anyway we've got seagate logo thing
going on we got a nice aluminum top so
that's something the pc version didn't
get however they did get a USB 3 chipset
so the good thing about all of that
though is because these are using the
Seagate sort of go flex I don't know if
they still use that I guess USM is the
new branding for it but whatever it is
they use their modular interfaces at the
back which means it's just to say to
drive in a you know plastic / aluminum
enclosure and then all you have to do if
you want to use a different interface
with it is source a different interface
cable while they're vulnerable firewire
800 usb3 doesn't matter you source a
different interface module plug it into
the drive and now this is a stylish
looking like brushed oh did I say the pc
one wasn't metal well it's not metal
stylish brush looking you know black /
silver / white drive that is now usb3
ready that's simple guys because all of
the logic is actually in here not here
this is just a drive and I love this
concept because it has saved my bacon
any number of times when I've gone
compared to traditional solutions which
were that the enclosure had all the
logic built into it and then you had
whatever interfaces you had if you
wanted to have two different interfaces
you have them both you had to have all
the logic you had to spend more on your
drive in order to in order to make sure
that you'd be able to plug it into
whatever you want well I just have a
bunch of these cables lying around these
days and then if I ever run into
scenario worm like oh shoot that system
doesn't support USB 3 but it does have
power t sada and I want to get the best
performance possible I throw my power to
say to one on there plug in my drive and
I'm good to go so that is that is the
solution for that and that's why I like
it so look at that this one also has
like a raised like sex
shiny Seagate logo and this one has just
like a flat till you get logo this one
slick more better shinier it's we're
running out of battery too so I think
that pretty much covers it anyway so
