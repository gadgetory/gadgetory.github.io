unboxing and quick overview of the to go
pad SL 10 10-inch tablet PC so this
features Windows 7 and let's go over
some of the some of the selling features
of this particular little guy so first
of all we've got an Intel Atom and for
51.6 6 gigahertz processor built an
e-reader it has a 10 inch LED backlit
multi-touch display full web support
including flash duh it has Windows 7 so
of course it does custom cases included
access to millions of program maps da
because it's Windows 7 so who needs an
app store when you have access to the
entire catalog of Microsoft Windows
applications not a bad point business
class features including Intel Atom
which is very power efficient to 250 gig
hard drive 2 gigs of ddr2 memory and it
is ready to go
TM to work fully functioning flash
player of course and built an e-reader
capability compatible with all notebook
ebook applications including Kindle Nook
and PDF so there we go there's not much
else in terms of information on the box
so let's get this thing open and have a
look at how how well-built it is more
than anything else I guess cuz the
hardware is pretty much unknown element
because it's an atom it's basically a
netbook and then it's gonna come down to
the build quality on the screen in all
likelihood so here's some online
resources thank you for purchasing CTL
drivers ok cool next we've got a driver
disc as well as some information
regarding registration and support and
let's have a look at the accessories
first I have to do so this I'm assuming
contains a battery and a power adapter
which it does first of all here's our
power adapter it's about the same size
as you'd find for any kind of netbook
because it's pretty much the same
hardware inside here and then we've got
a power plug oh okay well we'll open it
from that engine that was easy
power plug and finally we have all the
batteries already in there so this it
looks like a Oh neato we've got a USB to
VGA adapter so you got VGA out book out
book out put out of the box so that's
take that Apple alright uh we've got a
little magnetic cover here it actually
looks quite sleek the overall feel of it
is pretty pretty realistic as far as
fake leathers ago I'm assuming it's fake
but it feels pretty nice actually
there's a little stand here so I guess
you can put it like that should you so
desire overall strength of it is pretty
good see so just hold on by Little River
this looks like if are either cooling or
speakers can't really tell from here
sounds like this over so it's the to go
PC tablet that's actually kind of slick
that looks nice so yeah let's have a
look at what we've got in terms of in
terms of i/o if I can figure out how to
turn it on first that would be ideal
actually let me just look fit oh here we
go so here's the power button and it
looks like we have a battery indicator
there the light is now green alright I
can feel the hard drive spinning up in
my hands and let's keep moving around
the unit itself so on this side we have
nothing on the bottom we have nothing
and then on this side we have some IO so
here this appears to be land it's not
actually yeah okay cool so that's either
ten hundred or Gigabit LAN here's our
little vga adapter oh that wasn't
actually USB so that's just a little
custom custom adapter then we have one
USB port which is pretty handy and then
we've got mic as well as headphone jack
and then we have our power adapter there
so setup is preparing to launch your
computer for the first time set up is
checking video performance why don't we
have a look at video angles while we're
at it here rather viewing angles we've
got a built-in webcam right at the top
here and then we've also got some
buttons over here so that we've got
up-down okay and then two gears so if
you want to have a look at those
cameraman I want you to check out the
there we go now you can see it you
couldn't see it before so it does have a
glossy screen so if you're using it
indoors so I'm sure that won't be a
problem but you can see that it is quite
reflective you can quite easily see me
in the screen which mean
I better be pretty careful not to shine
it directly on the cameraman because
then you'll be able to see me no I'm not
gonna do okay so we were actually booted
up but I do want to have a look at the
viewing angle so when we don't have a
light directly behind it
the LED backlit screen is actually
viewable from a boat
I say comfortably you can look at it you
can actually read text from about here
okay so hopefully you can sort of
visualize with that anglers although
normally you'd be using it like this and
it's quite bright by default in terms of
vertical I can use it comfortably from
about here down to about here so from
top down it's not as good as from the
bottom down which makes sense because
you'd hold the tablet like this more
often than you'd hold it like this right
okay so I'll type in my username I guess
there we go so all I do is touch that
and then I can type Linus okay
enter and I'm not going to set up a
password right now I'm just going to
accept the license I'm hoping to be able
to try out the multi-touch a little bit
here because it is a multi-touch led
okay let's get the wireless set up this
is actually kind of slick you know what
let's take a minute and actually take it
out of the case I do like the case and
you know what if I was using one of
these I would probably use it with the
case just because it is pretty slick
what I would probably do to make this
they oh I think I just hit the power
button to shoot what I would probably do
to make this like kind of a perfect
tablet is I would take out the drive and
add an SSD so it's probably using based
on that capacity 250 gig it's probably
using a two and a half inch SSD so I'd
probably go ahead and throw throw an SSD
drive in there yeah shoot I hit the
power button my dad and other than that
it's pretty much it's pretty much
perfect it's pretty slick so here's the
Intel Atom logo it says ah no hassle
one-year warranty here on the back
here's the Windows 7 home premium cola
this is already in use so don't even
bother guys alright so here's the brand
of the well yes it's a notebook sort of
it's more of a tablet now in terms of
opening it up if you did want to replace
a drive or anything like that I haven't
but I have no idea how you'd do that
it's possible you can't although there's
gotta be there's got to be some way
but here on the front you can see it's
uh it's a little bit finger print prone
but you kind of expect that from from a
glossy screen and yeah it comes off
relatively easy easily but there's their
little branding element on there as well
as what else do oh yeah I found
something else here so this wasn't
accessible before but it looks like
there's an SD card reader here yeah
there's an SD card reader down there so
I guess you just throw that in for for
storage more than like to you know pull
photos off your camera especially
because it's hidden by the case but yeah
this is kind of neat actually in terms
of speed it's gonna be about what you'd
expect
easy bits quick and I think that's
pretty much all there is to it I mean
this Windows 7 on a tablet overall
thickness you know what why don't we do
a quick comparison against the iPhone 4
just so that you can see for scale the
the size of this guy so there's the
thickness of the unit and let's go ahead
and just do clonic kind of an overall
size comparison I wish I had an iPad
tablet to show you guys cuz that's sort
of a more apt comparison there you are
there it is next to the iPhone 4 and
yeah thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the to go pad and don't
forget to subscribe to - tech tips I
thought I better show you guys the
multi-touch capability before we
completely wrap this up so I'm browsing
around in a photo here this is just one
of the sample photos that comes with
Windows 7 so I can zoom out zoom in
around I can zoom in I can see if
there's a guy standing at the top of the
rock it looks like there appears to be
not a guy there so there you go yes it
does have a multi-touch touchscreen you
can open up the Penguins picture oh well
we tried to open up the Penguins picture
it's not selected though
it's kind of bizarre okay well thank you
for checking out the video don't forget
to subscribe same thing I said before
now we're looking at the desert again
