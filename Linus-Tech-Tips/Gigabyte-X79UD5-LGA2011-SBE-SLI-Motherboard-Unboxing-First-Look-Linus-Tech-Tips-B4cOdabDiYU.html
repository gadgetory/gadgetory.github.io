motherboard that I've seen from gigabyte
that has more of a plain slick look to
the front of the box vs well we see it
back it's sort of more like the
traditional style on the back of the box
where it's sort of marketing bullet
points on every square centimeter of the
packaging so the front very clean very
nice so let's see what they still
consider worthwhile to call it on the
front in spite of the dramatically
reduced amount of text so this is the
x79 you d 5 which is an x 79 board and
it's sort of an upper upper to mid-tier
board based on that they usually have a
UD something below that and usually aud
something above the five patent pending
3d power three-way digital engines the
digital CPU power as well as digital
memory power times to interesting they
also have their patent pending 3d bios
so the 3d bios and the 3d power utility
of are available for download and what
this means is it's a very unique way and
I haven't seen it in person yet so I
can't tell you too much about it but
it's a unique way that gigabyte has
implemented their UEFI BIOS so with
previous gigabyte boards 3068 boards
they're p67 boards they've had UEFI
features like support for 3 terabyte
plus hard drives but they haven't really
looked like a graphical like a GUI BIOS
like the sous ones on the MS islands
have well now they have a fully
graphical BIOS and I am really looking
forward to checking it out let's see
what else they have to say for
themselves so yeah this is an x 79 board
which means full support for intel core
i7s on the LGA 2011 platform PCI Express
gen3 is dependent on cpu and expansion
card compatibility but it is designed
for pcie gen3 which means the switching
is all correct for channel ddr3 you can
install up to 8 dim so that's up to 64
gigs of memory with the dims that are
available today with a Bluetooth 4.1
Wi-Fi card included on the back we find
a whole lot more of gigabyte whatnot so
three way to doodle engine means digital
memory digital CPU and digital memory so
a and B mean that some that's
the story so this is quad channel memory
which means there are four channels and
then you can put up to two dimms in each
channel so this is going to probably be
doing one of the dims in each Channel
and this will be doing one of the dims
in each of the other channels so that
way you have completely different power
delivery for each of the channels
although it's possible that they've done
it for the banks on either side of the
memory controller due to the differences
in interference for these banks and
these banks I'm not sure which way
they've done it either way it means very
advanced power management on the
motherboard for your memory 3d power so
this is to do with turbo voltage
response you can maintain optimal
voltage with load line calibration and
real-time PWM frequency switching so
these are all features that are possible
with a digital PWM 3d power utility
users can now enjoy a fully interactive
3d utility that facilitates adjustment
of the three dimensions that control the
power delivered to your CPU and memory
and voltage phase and frequency these
parameters are crucial ok 3d bios so
this shows the board here I've my
understanding is you can actually
highlight certain sections of the board
and be taken to the pertinent settings
for those sections that's a very
different way of doing things for sure
we see traditional gigabyte features
like dual BIOS with a switch allowing
you to pick between which one you want
to boot from it also gives you a
fail-safe in case something happens and
it gets corrupted onboard power OC and
reset buttons up to eight slots for
maximum capacity got it and ultra
durable 3 which is there two times
classroom proper PCB and high quality
components so let's get the actual board
opened up I'm sorry that took so long
but here we go that is a very nice
looking bored gigabyte with their LGA
1155 processors really took a major step
forward in terms of their board
aesthetics and now I'm seeing something
actually kind of new and that they're
also taking a major step forward with
their accessory aesthetics I remember
seeing black PCB 3-way sli ready boards
that came with these blue SLI bridges
check this out matte black SLI bridge
there you go that is how it is done
so what else we got in terms of
accessories here we have a flexible
two-way SLI bridge we have a flexible
black crossfire bridge all those are
looking fine looking good we have some
kind of a cable for plugging in
something we'll find out with that score
later got a couple antennas ok we have a
front USB 3 brushed metal third of
looking it's probably brushed plastic
but it looks pretty good and then that's
your internal header for USB 3 here ah
this is the double YouTube and what else
is on this thing I think it was a
sticker on the front they decided to
include this so this is a Bluetooth 4.0
and Wi-Fi card very cool looking this up
so those two antennas are for this guy
so there's the Bluetooth one and the
Wi-Fi antennas and then let's see those
they're both hooked into the same module
here looks like there's a USB port on
the back here or you can plug it in by
front USB which must be what that cables
for there we go so this allows you to
plug it into the USB header on your
motherboard and then you can have
Bluetooth Wi-Fi cool all right we got a
user manual including your drivers disc
used to download the latest off the
gigabyte website all that good stuff GC
Wi-Fi installation guide so here they're
going to show you how to do it all right
so you plug the thing into the thing and
then plug the other things into the
other thing and it's pretty
straightforward pretty much what I
already explained ok what else we got
multilingual installation guide book
gigabyte stickered will be home theater
sticker we got one two three four SATA
cables to a right angle and to our
straight to straight and finally an i/o
shield and then now see I lied before
I'm sorry you guys now the board itself
I'm just started going to make some room
here this is a platform and here we go
so this is an LGA 2011 board which means
full support for as i said before core
i7 for i7 extreme processors on the 2011
socket as well as all the goodies that
go along with it so that starts with the
quad channel memory controller so you
would install banks in
one two over here three and four four
channels of memory and then if you
wanted to have eight dims then you would
afterwards populate the black ones the
reason I would populate the gray ones
first is because you can see each of the
closest gray ones is slightly further
away from the socket than the closest
black ones which means that you can
install larger CPU coolers without
interfering with your RAM good thinking
gigabyte we appreciate those little
details very very much speaking of
little details the eight pin power
connector is at the top left of the
board and its exact right correct
location where I like to see it and
moving over we've got our power delivery
system so as with all x79 boards this is
packed into a very cramped space and I
would definitely recommend throwing some
active cooling whether it's incidental
air flow from your cpu cooler or whether
you got a fan in your case above the
board here in order to make sure that
that's getting enough cooling the power
switch is in an intelligent location up
at the top right because a lot of the
times you see them on the very bottom of
the boards and as soon as you install a
couple graphics cards you know here and
here they're covered and you can't
access them anyway so our 24 pins in its
correct location along the right-hand
edge we've got our front USB 3 header
and what I'm going to start calling the
correct location along the right-hand
edge because that's where things plug
into the front we've got 10 saitta ports
of some sort or another so these guys
are say 236 gigabit per second these are
say two to three gigabit per second and
these four are say 236 gigabit per
second as well so we've got a nice
little heat sink on our chipset there
we've got a reset switch we've got our
front panel headers clear CMOS jumper as
well as our dual bios's right here
moving over we've got our powered or
like super powered USB port for charging
things like iPads and other tablets
we've got two more front USB 2.0 ports
we have firewire in case anyone still
uses that we've got our front audio and
now let's have a look at the PCIe slot
layout so we've only got six pcie slots
which means that I mean I mean look at
look at how much space they would have
had to put a seven-point up there with
these memory slots right here there's
just not a lot of space on these x79
board so a lot of guys are putting
six slots on so the one here is pcie 16x
this one here is also wired for 16 x and
this guy's wired for 8 x which means
you're going to run 16 x 16 x for duel
cards or eight are 16 884 triple cards
we've also got to pc at you One X lots
and one legacy pci slot in case you
still need you know like an old Wi-Fi
card or sound card or whatever the case
may be let's go ahead and have a look at
the back of the board where we find oh
look at that you can select which bio so
you're going to use with a button on the
back that's outstanding you can also
clear the CMOS here and you have your
OneTouch overclocking button here this
is this is actually a great inclusion to
have on the back of the board this is
one of those multicolored back panels i
think i've seen in quite a while over
back to the like check deck this up this
looks great you got like black and grey
and like gunmetal and blue you know a
couple blue accents and then here it's
like back to the circuits which is what
gigabyte motherboards used to used to
kind of look like all over them but I
don't mind it on the back as long as the
color coding sort of makes sense so we
got our ps2 keyboard mouse combo ports
we got one two three four five six seven
eight USB 2.0 ports we have an e SATA
port so that's the USB 2.0 port we have
a straight a' SATA port so that's two
e-sata we have two USB 3.0 firewire
gigabit ethernet and finally 7.1 audio
out including an optical audio out so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the ga x79 you d 5
don't forget this supports all the
latest goodies including crossfire sli
socket 2011 quad channel memory pci
express 3.0 and Wi-Fi and all of that is
completely out of the book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
