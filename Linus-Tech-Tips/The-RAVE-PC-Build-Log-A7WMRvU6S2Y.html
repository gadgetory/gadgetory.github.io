wanted to glam up your computer you
could either use a colored cold cathode
tube or a UV cold cathode tube with some
black light sensitive components RGB
believe it or not wasn't a thing oh I
know right and that got us thinking what
if we combined the old and the new
we took RGB UV cathodes and and and
lasers and we smashed them all together
into one computer to make the craziest
most colourful most rave tastic PC the
world has ever seen
brace yourself and you know what else is
beautiful
today's video is brought to you by glass
wire last wire is a firewall that
displays your PC's incoming and outgoing
network connections in real time use

wire 2.0 at the link below
selecting the case was probably the
easiest part of this build the primary
PMO 1fx from silver stone literally has
a unicorn on the side what more could
you want
and it also has three 140 millimeter
fans upfront which means that there
should be enough space to fit our sky
white 420 millimeter radiator from primo
chill
even if Silverstone doesn't explicitly
say so so measurement wise it should fit
it's close it wants to do it yeah since
we're in for a real derivative good time
our big radiator troubles weren't over
yet though for our DDC pump and
reservoir we planned to use this bits
power mount that while sexy only
connects to 120 millimeter fans but
that's nothing that can't be fixed with
a few minutes of SolidWorks and some
acrylic vaporization with our laser
cutter not bad you might even say it's
profesh as the kids say now it's time
for some lighting RGB strip lights are
cool but what's even better is spatially
and temporally coherent lights oh yeah
we're talking about lasers so we got
this guy here off of Amazon it's
designed for DJ boots but we're all
about improvisation here and as it turns
out the hole for the PCI Express power
cables is just the right size for it
only problem is the laser is too big to
fit beside the massive prime titanium
1000 watt power supply from C sonic but
what if we could make the laser smaller
taking it apart revealed a lot of empty
space and dr. Alex prescribed a healthy
dose of angle
Galatian to fix the problem oh yeah
originally we wanted to add a smoke
machine inside the PC as well but
unfortunately the compact ones rely on
water vapor a hopefully obvious problem
inside a computer so we'll be relying on
mineral oil based fog instead alright so
now we've got a pretty funky case but
this is LT t so we will need plenty of
horses under the hood - first up was our
GPU and NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti which gets
the water treatment courtesy of bits
power we removed the stock heatsink
added some thermal grisly cry not and
after a generous application of thermal
pads we screwed on the water block now
it looks pretty good here but that stock
backplate now it's nice but a bit boring
what's not boring though is this
completely insane RGB backplate that we
got from v1 text so we attached that to
the GPU using magnets so it could be
easily removed later for our CPU we
chose a core i7 8700 K in every intel
build these days needs a nice helping of
liquid metal so pop the lid add some
conformal coating and then well in a
perfect world we would have picked up a
new syringe of liquid metal since the
old ones have a bad habit of sticking
fortunately we've already shown you how
to clean these kinds of things up there
we go with the cpu installed into our
asus rog Maximus 10 formula which comes
with water cooling for the vrm already
installed by the way and the cpu block
on it was time to plan out the loop
someday we will learn to do loop
planning before we start but it is not
this day
Wow Alex's technique for hardline is to
measure the vent cut a bit longer than
needed bend in the correct place
massaging out the flat spots or oddities
by hand then sand the
tubes down to the correct size so the
reason that we always recommend
finishing this off with sanding is that
it's super brittle and this way we can
avoid that happening so do this a couple
more times and you've got a hard-line
water-cooled PC first we filled the
system with distilled water and sysprep
to make sure that any strange things
would be removed next to find out if the
liquid metal spill had damaged our CPU
we went ahead and fired it up both
excellent looks like we're good at this
point things we're starting to come
together but the fans were a bit boring
and we didn't want to just rely on
throwing RGB fans into a case to make
them pop idea number one was to use UV
body paint which we have for some reason
and sort of just throw it on there but
by idea number one I mean the first idea
not the best idea and quite frankly the
rest were not much better so while the
fans were getting figured out and we've
got a custom cut mirror to go in the top
of the case we modified the laser
lightshow
to use the computer power supply by
soldering the leads to a sacrificial
molex connector and jazzed up the power
supply shroud using some spray adhesive
and a tasteful application of glitter if
such a thing were possible with the loop
cleaned overnight we flushed it with
distilled water and then filled it up
with UV pink dye from primo chill to
give it some pop back to the fans then
we tried using some different UV
reactive paint to spice them up but try
as we might all we ended up with were
crappy looking half painted fans so we
primed some more for another crack at it
I mean at least we've got a couple of
narwhals done while we waited for the
fans to dry so that's a positive point
coming back in on Monday IDI actually
had a stroke of genius
rainbow fans so we took those Prime fans
and ROYGBIV the heck out of them dabbing
on all the haters out there that thought
that they were gonna come out looking
bad
with some UV cathodes added to the front
to make them fluoresce
there was just a bit of tidying up to do
before it was time to admire the rave PC
in its final form so get up and shake
your booty to this dancer if ik glam can
arrange that check this for one more for
sickness
tell me
so it looks great
that's objectively and the performance
rocks too this thing stomps on every
game we threw at it and with some
overclocking we were able to easily get
5.1 gigahertz on all six cores with our
8700 case sitting at under 70 degrees
master op is back with the new force EDC
in-ear monitors they feature a single
six millimeter dynamic driver on each
side with both channels closely matched
for a cleaner more accurate sound you
can wear them at home in the office at
the gym I mean they're in your monitors
that's kind of the idea you can wear
them anywhere they feature a lightweight
plastic housing and they come with two
removable braided cables pick them up on
mass drop for just 60 bucks at the link
below thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
check out the link to where to buy the
stuff we featured in the video
description also down there's our merch
storage has cool shirts like this one
and our community forum which you should
totally join this is what happens when
we let someone who either has never been
to a rave or more likely can't remember
ever having been to a rave
helped me with our makeup I mean you see
l-wire under the studio lights you can't
even tell that it's flashing could you
tell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
