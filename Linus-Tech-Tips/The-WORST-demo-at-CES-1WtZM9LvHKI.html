you by the D brand grip and D brand
prism screen protector you can check
them both out at the link in the video
description we are here in gigabytes
booth where they are showing off the
latest iteration of their aro 15 gaming
laptop and this is actually an
interesting one so it can be equipped
with up to an RT x28 e max q graphics
card and up to a core I 989 50 H K so
yes my friends that is the unlocked six
core hyper threaded processor and it's
all in this tiny slim form factor
how have they crammed this amount of
hardware in here well conveniently the
unit that I picked up actually had the
bottom of it fall off while I was
standing here getting ready to shoot so
you can go ahead and take a peek inside
with me see look it has no screws in it
hold on wait for it honestly I did not I
did not remove those screws the battery
just started like like popping out in my
hand and I was like what's going on here
so here's our GPU here's our CPU here's
the cooling for the vrm we've got a dual
fan design like we've seen in previous
generation Aero 15s couple memory slots
we've got nvme storage just a single one
of those no two and a half inch storage
but that's okay I wouldn't have expected
it there's only so much they can do for
something like that but if you really
wanted to add more storage look at that
you've got another easily accessible
nvme slot but here's the thing gigabytes
main selling point for this is not
actually just that they've taken a very
impressive spec and put it in a compact
laptop as you guys might have seen if
you're paying really close attention
there this is the world's first AI
laptop so what exactly does AI laptop
mean while they partnered with Microsoft
Azir and so they're kind of working
together to share the cost of
development here but the idea is that
they've got this demo here with us
appears to be pub G running 50 45 50 ish
FPS without AI and high 50s low 60s with
AI now I had some questions about how
exactly it would be that AI would make a
game run
at a higher fps and I'm gonna have to
consult my notes here for a second so I
asked what exactly does AI do in a
laptop and they said it alik AIT's CPU
and GPU power according to the workload
then I pointed out that normally while
gaming neither the CPU nor the GPU is
power constrained and asked what benefit
there would be then the answer was well
you don't have to turn it on if you
don't want to but it's designed to make
life a little bit easier for the average
end-user my next question why exactly
are you running these as pre-recorded
videos rather than having the actual
games running to show the FPS difference
okay they had a pretty good answer for
that these are our TX graphics cards and
in videos not letting anyone run actual
games on them fair enough and then I
asked okay what about other stuff and
they were like okay well here's the
thing it's designed to be able to
predict what a particular application
needs based on a machine learning data
set I mean okay cool
so what other demos do you have allow me
so here we have an AI laptop versus a
non AI laptop and they actually got rid
of their their pre-recorded videos and
fired up Adobe premier for me so that I
could do a side-by-side test
now it's Adobe Premiere cs5 and I asked
why it was cs5 which is about ten year
old software at this point and I said
well that was what we had time for and I
kind of went okay and we went ahead and
ran our demo as I expected I'm not sure
if I was the only one here but as I
expected the AI and non AI once finished
the encode at exactly the same time so
really this whole experience has raised
more questions than answers I asked why
they finished at the same time they said
well it's pre-production and I guess
we're gonna have to follow up and take a
closer look at the AI laptop in the
future once it's had a little bit more
time to Train
it's AI to do something speaking of
doing something I'm gonna show you my
phone with a deep brand grip on it deep
brand sponsored our content here at CES
2019 their grip case is super grippy
it's got clicky buttons Thank You Colton
I felt smarter while I was wearing nails
yeah a super clicky buttons
it's drop its drop resistant like
basically lioness proof what else is
there to say about oh right you can
customize it with Adi brand skin of
course also they're showing off their
new prism screen protectors they've got
this great applicator that makes it easy
to put on it feels nice and glassy from
the front but the impact protection that
is where the prism really shines so you
could literally take your phone hammer a
nail into a piece of wood not that I'm
recommending it and peel off your screen
protector which is of course dent it to
hell but your screen huh
screen still looks good really nice
check them both out at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
guys if you dislike this video you can
go ahead and do that but if you liked it
and you love AI click like get
subscribed don't miss any of our CES
