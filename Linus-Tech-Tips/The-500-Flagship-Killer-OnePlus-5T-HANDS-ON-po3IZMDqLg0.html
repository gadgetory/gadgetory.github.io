York City and why do I feel like I was
just here oh right because I was anyway
oneplus just unveiled their latest
flagship the 1 + 5 t and they sponsored
us to come here to be among the select
group of people who will be hands-on
with it first
now there are a handful of major changes
with the five-team
let's do the big deal stuff first this
is the first device ever from oneplus to
deviate from the traditional 16 by 9
aspect ratio and also the first to
feature an immersive display with super
narrow bezels and it's AMOLED which is
yet again this is becoming a theme here
off first for one plus its 2160 by 1080
for better battery life compared to
higher resolution options and it comes
with the usual benefits of OLED like a
near infinite contrast ratio and power
savings on darker backgrounds though it
also comes with the usual drawbacks so
I'll be watching for any early reports
of burnin on this display I'm really
diggin the body design here it's super
clean with the antenna lines well
disguised and you can get it in any
color you want
as long as it's black and while the
finish is a little bit slippery in the
hand it's nothing that a vinyl skin
couldn't fix and the shape and aspect
ratio make it pretty handleable
considering that is a 6 inch display I
like the way that they've also squeezed
together the nav buttons at the bottom
so it's a little bit easier to reach
across with one hand if you don't have
gigantic digits now not generally a huge
fan of rear fingerprint scanners but one
plus figures they've gotten around this
with their high speed face unlock it
does seem to work pretty well so far but
I will need to spend more time with it
the rear camera also got some
interesting upgrades 4k 30fps video is
electronically stabilized now but
probably more importantly I've been
saying for a while now about both the
node 8 and the iPhone 8 plus that the
telephoto lens on the second rear camera
doesn't achieve much more sharpness than
digitally zooming the usually sharper
main shooter well apparently oneplus
agrees because their dual 16 and 20
megapixel camera system
uses two lenses with the same focal
lengths to achieve debt sensing for
their portrait mode and their second one
is actually tuned for better low-light
performance with a 4 to 1 pixel mapping
scheme that they're calling intelligent
pixel technology requires more testing
as with everything we're seeing today
but it's very interesting
and finally true to the one-plus
tradition the specs are taught drawer
especially considering the aggressive
pricing every 5 team will get a
snapdragon 835 processor then there's 6
gigs of RAM on the 64 gig model and 8
gigs of lpddr4 X memory on the 128 gig
model and that's accompanied by an
adrenal 540 GPU dual SIM slots fast
type-c charging a 3300 milliamp hour
battery and yes my friends you can't
really see it because it's dark in here
but that is a headphone jack and they're
doing this without making a ton of
compromises that I feel are likely to
affect their average user off the top of
my head you are giving up wireless
charging but you're getting a superbly
crafted blasted metal body that should
be harder to break than a glass backed
one and you're giving up a dedicated
button or a squeeze for Bixby or a
Google assistant but you're getting one
plus is trademark free position
notification slider so I'll be spending
the next couple of weeks with the 5 t
hopefully I'm taking one away from the
unveiling here with me today and I'll be
looking deeper at the 16 megapixel
selfie camera as well as some of the
software tweaks that one classes built
based on their community feedback
program like parallel apps so let me
know in the comments if you have any
questions about it that you would like
to see addressed in my review the 5 T
will be available on November 21st so
thanks for watching and thanks again to
oneplus for bringing me out here to see
their latest and greatest</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
