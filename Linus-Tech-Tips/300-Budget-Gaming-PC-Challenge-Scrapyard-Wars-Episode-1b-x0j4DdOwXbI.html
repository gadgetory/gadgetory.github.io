the very best gaming rig that we can
bill it seems like an okay deal for an
8400 computer to me someone just
accepted our offer for $100 on a 79 50
sorry I can't come down to get anything
tonight so I might have to pass and now
the conclusion we're part of it I've got
a 500 watt and check power supply that
we're headed to pick up right now and
then the r9 290 I got for 180 so that's
actually pretty sweet
we will go pick that up later did he say
290 is that fast
what's a graphics card okay so it's day
2 of our search and we've got to find
out where our destination is so I'm not
exactly sure where we're going okay I
have the address for our first
appointment on my laptop which battery's
low ah scrap yard whore's one there we
go now we're good okay I really hope
that's not it
I think it might be holy crap this is
some sketch okay so this is five three
three two
holy crap this is like this is some
sketchy eelain's no parking
well they parked in front of it weird
like where does this door go I don't
know there's some blood in there though
hello are you Santa
hi I'm Linus nice to meet you this is uh
Nick he can turn off the camera if you
want no cameras today that's fine yeah
so our contact here got us pretty hooked
up actually he had the whole thing
running on a test bench to show that it
booted up and had core temp cpu Zed
installed and everything so we could
validate that everything's good to go so
this is an EK 35 ds3 are a pretty decent
little board it's got an extra chip on
there for SATA to raid we've got eight
gigs of what appears to be mix-and-match
so we've got half Samsung half Kingston
ddr2 800 there's aq 6600 on there with a
cooler and then we also just thrown in
got what appears to be the remains of a
freezer seven I think we can make use of
that with with an extra fan or something
along those lines and then we also got
an earth wats 500 watt power supply
which was better than I was expecting I
actually didn't know what model of power
supply we were going to get but this has
got two PCIe six pin connectors on it so
that means that powering our graphics
card later isn't going to be a problem
at all and then I thought we were
getting a 500 gig hard drive and we
actually ended up with a one terabyte
hard drive so oh yeah right in the case
so there were a few sort of cool Master
Elite class options or there was a
silverstone tjo for that happens to be
missing a couple of bay covers well I
have some day covers we've got a card
reader a floppy drive yeah baby
so oh and look the Vancouver Olympic
mascots that was a bonus I didn't even
have to pay extra for that all right so
I'm feeling pretty good we just need the
rest of this day to go well still need a
graphics card so I just got my antique
basic power 500 watt continuous powered
power supply which is exactly what I was
looking for looks like it's in good
shape
clean happy with all my kind of stuff
while I was talking to the guy though I
was like yeah thanks for doing this like
I know it's really short notice because
I just emailed them this morning and it
was his dad or whatever and he's like
yeah it's been an interesting day
someone was just here picking up a case
in power supply like 20 minutes ago what
who do you think that is there's like no
way that isn't Linus except it wasn't
man we're probably so close oh that
would have been so funny if we were
picking stuff up at the same time
anyways let's let's go get some lunch
cuz you know we're having a chill day
they're probably freaking out driving
everywhere so I had multiple leads on 79
50s for $100 and then I actually ended
up with two GTX 580 s lined up for $100
I decided I wanted 7950 so I bailed on
all the five ATS
I got back to what looked like a very
promising 7950 lead and then heard
nothing so this guy who's actually going
to be on different job sites today but I
asked him very nicely yesterday to bring
it with him in case I need it I'm gonna
try and track him down next after we go
meet up with the guy who I promised
t-shirts to technically I don't think
we're allowed to use anything that we
didn't get
but Luke will never know that I used my
own ah yeah that's true we can always
just lie to lose right yes
hi as a climbers lie yes it's right in
there well so we just arrived to meet up
with them I was trying to figure out how
to tell them I don't have the right
shirt turns out I did grab the right
shirts we do have Linus tech tips shirts
so this will be this will be a lot more
successful than it otherwise would have
been still hello gentlemen nice to meet
you sorry I wasn't able to take the card
unfortunately but so I found a 7950
which gives me about a 10% edge in GPU
performance yes so I gotta take it my
plan for this if I didn't get the Zalman
was I was just gonna rip the block off
and use like a stock Intel heatsink on
the GPU core or something which would
have been awesome it's like super ghetto
but I found this 7950 so I kind of had
to take it but you had said you wanted
me to sign something as well I brought a
silver pen smartass
they're the real Linus alright
since I showed up and didn't didn't buy
anything actually all right well it's a
pleasure to meet you gentlemen we've got
to get to our next appointment here and
I'm gonna go get like a hot chocolate or
something but I'll see you dance later
Wow because we're not five minutes
really we're nine men too
it is now 140 he was supposed to be here
at 1:15 so he just texted me saying
he'll be here in one minute but I'm like
it's fine I guess
1:45 my god it was easy to leave we
gotta go
I don't like when people are late I
especially don't like it when they're
battling and when I like clearly stated
that it was important and I needed to go
early
7950 guy said he'd call us back in ten
minutes and that was 18 minutes ago now
the guy we just met with but we gave the
t-shirt to he has the 580 Hydra copper
so what I'm thinking I haven't seen him
leave yet not that I'm parked outside a
Starbucks like stalking someone I
haven't seen him leave yet so if I don't
hear back from 7950 guy that's our
back-up plan and we take that and then
we try and get in touch with Zelman
cooler guy again and we go for it
because that's down in Richmond which is
kind of far but but definitely doable
finest speaking okay I'll be there in
about half an hour as well there you are
let's have a look at our spoils as long
as it works this will be the only piece
we haven't validated this is a pretty
beefy looking card this is a mostly rear
exhaust style card so it's got the it's
got the cooling fan just above the vrm
cooling piece right here all right I am
feeling good I don't know if this is
technically cheating because it's just
an aesthetic thing but I'm gonna try and
find some aluminum face plates I
actually have some boxes of random junk
that I'm taking to the office this is
like a $40 piece that realistically I
wasn't Luke's not going to believe I
salvaged or got for nothing these are
what I actually need yeah okay all right
so I'm thinking we'll do the build off
in here so one person will take this
desk surface and then the other person
will set up a couple desks here and then
we can use our pile of computer cases to
construct like like a wall a wall like a
barrier so that neither of us can see
what the other is doing so we've been
back at HQ already for like two hours
and Luke and Brandon or
nowhere to be seen they said we can
start building it three so given that
it's 2:30 right now we're pretty close
so let's get set up
save on select until 7:30 Series SSDs
with instant rebates during presidents
week February 22nd to March 1st 2015
click now to learn more I'm excited this
is going to be awesome that's what I
said before we turn to the camera on and
now we're doing it again it's fake but
it is what I legitimately said so is it
fake I don't know no one knows ok so are
we doing the parts part show off Oh even
though we have no alcohol and no
cleaning cloths I found this napkin on
the floor oh that's weird it doesn't
have a model number maybe this is an
unreleased processor I digest it has a
novel number so there's our CPU that's
going to be a phenomenal performer
here's our RAM okay here's our other Ram
alright here's our third set of RAM our
fourth set of RAM
and our eighth set of RAM and our
twelfth set of RAM and he's got a little
bit of a viewing port back there I got
to be careful he can see around that
corner quite easily and he's a little
rascally devil I'd be careful with that
one that's the sound of a quality side
panel being dropped right there
I would only drop it like that if I
wasn't worried about damaging it because
I have so many cases I bought six cases
I thought that would probably be about
about par yeah you probably only bought
six cases because you're gonna need six
cases to end up with a fully functional
one yep next time on scrapyard Wars Luke
runs out of gas in the bad part of town
Nick fights the Statue of Liberty yeah I
just don't ever like freedom
how's what what are the bathroom what
about them
oh yeah we're vacuum cleaning what no
it's not it's his week this week I know
last week I missed it
oh I stayed late editing a video last
week so I was kind of not in the mood to
do garbage and also I forgot</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
