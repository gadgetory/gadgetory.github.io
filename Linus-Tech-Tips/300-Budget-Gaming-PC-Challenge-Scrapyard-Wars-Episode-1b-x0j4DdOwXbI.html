the very best gaming rig that we can
build seems like an okay deal for an
8400 computer to me someone just
accepted our offer for $100 on a 7950
sorry I can't come down to get anything
tonight so I might have to pass and now
the conclusion or part of it
I've got a 500 watt Antec power supply
that we're headed to pick up right now
and then the r9 290 I got for 180 so
that's actually pretty sweet
we will go pick that up later did he say
290 is that fast
what's a graphics card okay so it's day
2 of our search and we've got to find
out where our destination is so I'm not
exactly sure where we're going okay I
have the address for our first
appointment on my laptop which battery's
low scrappy our doors one there we go
now we're good okay I really hope that's
not it I think it might be holy crap
this is some sketch okay so this is five
three three two
holy crap this is like this is some
sketchy demons
no parking well they parked in front of
it like where does this door go I don't
know there's some blood in there though
hello are you Santa
hi I'm Linus nice to meet you this is
Nick he can turn off the camera if you
want that's fine yeah
so our contact here got us pretty hooked
up actually he had the whole thing
running on a test bench to show that it
booted up and had core temp cpu Zed
installed and everything so we could
validate that everything's good to go so
this is an ek 35d s3 yard a pretty
decent little board it's got an extra
chip on there for SATA to raid we've got
eight gigs of what appears to be
mix-and-match so we've got half Samsung
half Kingston ddr2 800 there's aq 6600
on there with a cooler and then we also
just thrown in got what appears to be
the remains of a freezer seven I think
we can make use of that with with an
extra fan or something along those lines
and then we also got an earth watts 500
watt power supply which was better than
I was expecting I actually didn't know
what model of power supply we were gonna
get but this has got two PCIe six pin
connectors on it so that means that
powering our graphics card later isn't
gonna be a problem at all and then I
thought we were getting a 500 gig hard
drive and we actually ended up with a
one terabyte hard drive so oh yeah right
in the case so there were a few sort of
Coolermaster elite class options or
there was a silverstone tjo for that
happens to be missing a couple of bay
covers well I have some day covers we've
got a card reader a floppy drive yeah
baby
so oh and look the Vancouver Olympic
mascots that was a bonus I didn't even
have to pay extra for that alright so
I'm feeling pretty good we just need the
rest of this day to go well it still
need a graphics card so I just got my
antique basic power 500 watt continuous
copper powers
which is exactly what I was looking for
looks like it's in good shape clean
happy with all that kind of stuff
well I was talking to the guy though I
was like yeah thanks for doing this like
I know it's really short notice because
I just emailed them this morning and it
was his dad or whatever and he's like
yeah it's been an interesting day
someone was just here picking up a case
in power supply like 20 minutes ago
what who do you think that is there's
like no way that isn't Linus except it
wasn't man
we're probably so close oh that would
have been so funny if we were picking
stuff up at the same time anyways let's
let's go get some lunch cuz you know
we're having a chill day they're
probably freaking out driving everywhere
so I had multiple leads on 79 50s for
$100 and then I actually ended up with
two GTX 580 s lined up for $100 I
decided I won in 79 fifty so I bailed on
all the five 80s I got back to what
looked like a very promising 7950 lead
and then heard nothing so this guy who's
actually gonna be on different job sites
today but I asked him very nicely
yesterday to bring it with him in case I
need it I'm gonna try and track him down
next after we go meet up with the guy
who I promised t-shirts to technically I
don't think we're allowed to use
anything that we didn't get
but Luke will never know that I used my
own ah yeah that's true we can always
just lie to lose right yes fine is it -
lie yes it's right in that back well so
we just arrived to meet up with them I
was trying to figure out how to tell
them I don't have the right shirt turns
out I did grab the right shirts we do
have Linus tech tips shirts so this will
be this will be a lot more successful
than it otherwise would have been
so hello gentlemen nice to meet you
sorry I wasn't able to take the card
unfortunately but so I found a 7950
which gives me about a 10% edge and GPU
performance yes so I gotta take it my
plan for this if I didn't get the Zalman
was I was just gonna rip the block off
and use like a stock Intel heatsink on
the GPU core or something which would
have been awesome it's like super ghetto
but I found this 7950 so I kind of had
to take it but you had said you wanted
me to sign something as well I brought a
silver pen smartass they're the real
Linus
since I showed up and didn't didn't buy
anything actually all right well it's a
pleasure to meet you gentlemen we've got
to get to our next appointment here and
I'm gonna go get like a hot chocolate or
something but I'll see you gents later
Wow because we're not five minutes early
were 19
it is now 140 he was supposed to be here
at 1:15 so he just texted me saying
he'll be here in one minute but I'm like
it's fine I guess 1:45
I got it Lisa philately coming up I
don't like it when people are late I
especially don't like it when they're
battling and when I like clearly stated
that it was important and I needed to go
early
7950 guy said he'd call us back in 10
minutes and that was 18 minutes ago
now the guy we just met with that we
gave the t-shirt to he has the 580 hydro
copper so what I'm thinking I haven't
seen him leave yet not that I'm parked
outside a Starbucks like stalking
someone I haven't seen him leave yet so
if I don't hear back from 7950 guy
that's our back-up plan and we take that
and then we try and get in touch with
Zalman cooler guy again and we go for it
because that's down in Richmond which is
kind of far but but definitely doable
finest speaking okay I'll be there in
about half an hour as well there you are
let's have a look at our spoils as long
as it works this will be the only piece
we haven't validated this is a pretty
beefy looking card this is a mostly rear
exhaust style card so it's got the it's
got the cooling fan just above the vrm
cooling piece right here alright I am
feeling good I don't know if this is
technically cheating cuz it's just an
aesthetic thing but I'm gonna try and
find some aluminum face plates I
actually have some boxes of random junk
that I'm taking to the office this is
like a $40 piece that realistically I
wasn't Luke's not gonna believe I
salvaged Oh God for nothing
these are what I actually need yeah okay
all right so I'm thinking we'll do the
build off in here so one person will
take this desk surface and then the
other person will set up a couple desks
here and then we can use our pile of
computer cases to construct like like a
wall a wall like a barrier so that
neither of us can see what the other is
doing so we've been back at HQ already
for like two hours and Luke and Brandon
are nowhere to be seen they said we can
start building at 3:00 so given that
it's 2:30 right now we're pretty close
so let's get set up
save on select until 730 series SSDs
with instant rebates during presidents
week February 22nd to March 1st 2015
click now to learn more I'm excited this
is going to be awesome that's what I
said before we turn to the camera on and
now we're doing it again it's fake but
it is what I legitimately said so is it
fake I don't know
no one knows ok so are we doing the
parts part show off Oh even though we
have no alcohol and no cleaning cloths I
found this napkin on the floor oh that's
weird it doesn't have a model number
maybe this is an unreleased processor i
digest it has a model number so there's
our CPU that's gonna be a phenomenal
performer here's our RAM okay
here's our other ramp alright here's our
third set of RAM our fourth set of RAM
and our eighth set of RAM she's got a
little bit of a viewing port back there
I got to be careful he can see around
that corner quite easily and he's a
little rascally devil I'd be careful
with that one that's the sound of a
quality side panel being dropped right
there
I would only drop it like that if I
wasn't worried about damaging it because
I have so many cases I bought six cases
I thought that would probably be about a
vote par yeah you probably only bought
six cases because you're gonna need six
cases to end up with a fully functional
one yeah next time on scrapyard Ward's
luke runs out of gas in the bad part of
town nick fights the Statue of Liberty
I just don't have like freedom
how's what what what about that oh yeah
you're about cleaning what no it's not
his it's his week this week ever
no last week I missed it oh editing a
video last week so I was kind of not in
the mood to do garbage and also I forgot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
