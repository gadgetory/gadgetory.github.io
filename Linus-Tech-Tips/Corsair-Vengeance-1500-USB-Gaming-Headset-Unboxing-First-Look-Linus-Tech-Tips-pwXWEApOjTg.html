exciting product I recently unboxed the
rest of the Vengeance series headsets
from Corsair but now I have the cream of
the crop the Vengeance 1500 this is a
Dolby 7.1 gaming headset so yes it uses
Dolby technology through software to
enable a surround gaming experience in
spite of the fact that it does have only
two speakers it is four ok immersive
intensive online gaming got that all
right let's see what Corsair has to say
for themselves on the back of the box
you can experience immersive multi
channel gaming put on the Vengeance 1500
Android gaming the way it was intended
50 millimeter drivers which is awesome
by the way
deliver pristine audio reproduction and
7.1 channel dolby digital USB sound
processing gives you the tactical
advantage of pinpoint accuracy not
everyone prefers virtual surround
effects I personally prefer just leaving
it in stereo but if you do like the
virtual surround effects then this
headset has it whereas something like
the Vengeance 1300 if you're using it
with your onboard audio or whatever the
case may be doesn't have that option ok
over here we've got sort of more general
technical specification so you can go
ahead and pause the video if you really
want to watch that this part is
important for this one though is the
fact that it's not going to work on a
Mac it will only work on Windows 7 Vista
or XP because it does require a driver
for the built-in USB sound card ok dolby
headphone technology for 7.1 surround
we've talked about that so far oh this
is interesting the subwoofer signal is
mixed into the left and right channels
in equal proportions so that means that
regardless of where a bass sort of noise
is coming from you're actually going to
get that encompassing sort of surround
Rumble effect with the lows which is
interesting because as you guys probably
know bass is supposed to be pretty non
directional so if you have a box with
the wrong way so if you have a subwoofer
in the corner of the room for example
which is often recommend
set up for home theater set ups then you
know something like an explosion is not
coming in to only your right ear you're
going to be sort of feeling it and
hearing it all over so that's that's an
interesting way to approach that so I'm
going to take the headset out of the
packaging this was actually a relatively
easy to extract headset some headsets
come in just brutal packaging that I
can't figure out how to open then I'm
just gonna have a look at the
documentation that course are in please
so we've got a little warranty guide
here so this headset includes a non
transferable warranty which is fine
three few people are interested in
sharing headsets anyhow and for a
specific length but okay give me a sec
I'm gonna find it let's go ahead and cut
it for now so guys it's not in here
that's why I couldn't find it the
specific length of time is outlined on
the box itself Corsair guarantee of two
years all right the next one is stop do
not return this product to the store
Corsair prefers that you contact them
for technical support in order to give
them a chance to resolve any issues you
may have with the product before
returning it which is great because
Corsair is all about the support and
giving them a chance to actually
leverage that aspect of their business
is definitely a good idea because they
will usually 99% of the time find a way
to make you happy so the Vengeance 1500
besides using USB which we'll talk a
little bit more about later has a
slightly different overall build quality
than the Vengeance 1300 so I'm just
gonna grab the Vengeance 1300 here for
side-by-side comparison so you guys can
see and the first thing that stands up
to me about the 1500 versus the 1300 is
the metal side so that looks really
really sharp on the 1500 so you can tell
that the 1300 is a slightly less
expensive product you can also see that
on the boom Mike's
the Vengeance 1300 uses shiny plastic
here and the Vengeance 1500 uses Natal a
metal which is yeah it's actually okay
hold on
I can't actually tell if it's made of
metal or if it's more like a metallic
looking plastic somewhat cool to the
touch but then on the sides it looks
like it looks like plastic so it's
possible it's like a thin piece of metal
over the plastic that would be my guess
right about now but you know what if you
guys know for sure let me know let me
know okay another thing too is it uses
matte accents instead of glossy accents
in certain places like here as well as
actually that's about it okay so that
covers the physical differences in terms
of the headset so I'm gonna go ahead I'm
gonna put it on I'll model it for you oh
no wait
so I want to show you guys the the foam
that Corsair is using on the ear pads so
this is a nice soft foam that is
actually very very I mean I want to call
it memory like because I don't know that
they're using memory foam but you can
see that once I push on it it actually
takes quite a while to rebound back to
its original position this is much more
comfortable than a foam that just
reflexes right back to the original
position after you press it because what
that will do is it'll give constant
pressure on your head and on your ears
whereas this is going to mold itself to
you and create more like a cushioning
layer as opposed to pressing on you so
the 50ml drivers are here you can
clearly see they're 5 centimeters in
diameter and then also on the headset
itself I want to show you guys the foam
that's in the top here quite thick very
soft shouldn't be too much in a
difficulty in terms of comfort for CEREC
headsets at this point are well known
for the comfort that they provide so now
I'm gonna put the unit on before I talk
about it any more
so in terms of adjustments you can
adjust either side this much so if you
have a very tall head and I mean a tall
head I mean even with my hair all tall
like this you can see I can care how
long I'm gonna put it on my ears
properly and clearly stick my hand in
between the headset and the top of my
head so or I can pull the the earphones
down to hear whichever the case may be
I've used it pretty much in its smallest
configuration or maybe a couple notches
out on either side very fine adjustments
on both sides and it does
in place quite well it's hard to move it
which i think is a good thing because
you don't want to be adjusting your
headset every time you put it on the
boom mic is adjustable this way so you
can move it further or closer to your
mouth depending on what you prefer and
it can either go up all the way or it
can come down to about here so if your
mouth is located around the sort of
Adam's apple area and you will be able
to easily talk into the mic
regardless okay what else do I want to
say about this one I think that's pretty
much it for the headset I mean if you
guys want to see sort of the look from
either side oh yeah trouble with that oh
yeah so they are flexible this way
so that means that if your head has sort
of a different shape to it or your ears
are further back or further forward on
your head it's gonna fit quite
comfortably either way and let's have a
look at the included options on this
side of things so we've got our volume
down and our volume up as well as our
microphone mute button here so these are
in line and they come down about this
far from where they attach to the
headset so they'll hang comfortably
somewhere where you can reach them at a
moment's notice the cord itself is quite
long so you can plug it into the front
of your face or you can plug it into the
back of your case or your neighbors case
should you so desire because it's really
really long and it's a nice high-quality
braided cord so it's not gonna snag on
anything and I wouldn't expect it to
sustain any damage if you accidentally
hit it with something sharp either
although your cats could probably do a
number on it I've lost a couple headsets
to my accounts the USB connector at the
bottom so you can see this is a purely
USB headset there's no analog option
some headsets like the Vengeance here
this the Vengeance 1100 come with a
little USB sound card and then analogue
connectors but this one just terminates
straight to a USB connection because it
is meant to be used with the included
software and which I guess you download
from the Corsairs website because I
don't see a disc included which is what
I would tell you to do anyway download
the latest software from the coarser
website and it is not meant to be used
with an analogue sound card so just
kind of show you guys from all angles
what it looks like yeah here's what the
mic down this is the part that people
watch these videos for I suppose you
know what does the product actually look
like when its installed in this case its
installed on a user and thank you for
checking out my video the vengence 1500
from Corsair don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips from our unboxings
reviews and other computer videos here's
another difference that we didn't notice
until after we stopped filming and that
check this out
so the 1,300 actually uses more like
they seem to use the same foam so I can
tell you guys that right off to that but
the 1,300 views is like a plethora
material here whereas the 1500 uses a
cloth material so these are going to
sound more closed and these are going to
sell more open so they are gonna have
slightly different audio characteristics
even if you hook these two headsets up
to the same source so these are very
different products and it comes down to
what the individual user is looking for
whether they would want to choose a
vengence 1500 or a vengence 1300s so a
quick guide would be if you're using a
notebook you don't have an aunt you
don't have a dedicated sound card I've
gone with the 1500 right off the bat
especially if you don't want to buy a
sound card if you do have a dedicated
sound card it's probably going to be
better than the USB audio solution
especially if it's a halfway-decent card
so then I'd go with something like the
1300 so that you can make use of the
processing power of your sound card</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
