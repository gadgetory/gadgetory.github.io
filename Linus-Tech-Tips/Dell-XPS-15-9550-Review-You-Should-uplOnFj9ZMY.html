Dell ironically we're never really my
bag baby
however due to recent events I've been
forced to rethink this strategy for one
thing you guys seem to love the Dell
content and for another they've just
done some really great stuff lately like
this easily upgradable inspire on 75 59
model with a gtx 960m
and a reasonable price tag so by popular
demand here is my take on the XPS 15 95
50
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more ok so I don't
pay much attention to Dell so I actually
knew very little about the new super
market new XPS 15 when I pulled it out
of the box making these initial
impressions very raw first D brand who
provided the unit to us did a great job
of the skin apparently they do pcs now
in addition to Mac so good work robots
and second while it feels really sturdy
I was surprised by the size and weight
because compared to the blade 14 2015
that I use as a daily driver it just
didn't feel that slim and sexy in spite
of the carbon fiber construction though
there are reasons for that so we'll get
to that later but let's do the physical
tour it really starts with the screen on
this bad boy on the one side of the slim
well-constructed panel you'll find a
Dell logo surrounded in our case by a
woodgrain vinyl skin and on the other
side the built to order infinity edge
display bill boasts about the
practically non-existent bezels the
viewing angles and the color
reproduction of this exile panel and
I've got to give it to them it looks
awesome
it gets bright enough for easy use in
broad daylight and more importantly for
me it gets dim enough without assistance
from a third-party app for use at night
in the dark I went with a 1080p non
touch model because I was considering
the 9550 as a blade 14 replacement and I
was willing to trade display sharpness
for battery life but it's also available
with a touch enabled 4k EXO display as
well my one complaint here was that
there was more backlight bleed than I
would like to see in the corners but
frankly I stopped noticing it after the
first day so there you go what I did
notice day-to-day though was the speed
of this thing I went with a pretty
decked out model so packed inside the
guts on the bottom is an Intel Core i7
6700 HQ 45 watt quad core with hyper
reading 16 gigs of DDR for memory
apparently upgradable with 16 gig dims
to 32 gigs total a gtx 960m 2 gig video
card and a 512 gig pci express based SSD
a samsung 950 one to be precise shall
win though Dell doesn't specify so your
mileage may vary in the future but while
I think they've got a wide enough range
of specs to meet almost anyone's needs
from mine all the way to someone who
wants something more basic I continue to
be disappointed by their online
configurator Dell the GPU belongs in the
summary at the top of the page these two
models one of which has onboard graphics
and the other of which packs a gtx 960m
looked like you're paying 250 dollars
for a hard drive upgrade unless you
scroll way down not only that but while
the 512 gig SSD models say solid-state
drive the one terabyte PCIe SSD models
you know the ones where the storage
drive costs about a third of the entire
machine are labeled hard drive does
anyone even proofread these get your
head in the game and while we're at it
Dell stop being misleading if the 4k
option is the only one with Corning
Glass on the front then that shouldn't
be mentioned in the chassis blurb on a
model that doesn't have a 4k display and
doesn't offer it as an upgrade get you
together marketing and product
merchandising teams all right this is a
good product so get this stuff right
because for me actually yeah it is a
good product the XPS 15 95 50 was mostly
a treat to use the i/o is a very solid
mix with SD USB 3 a battery indicator
and a lock on the right and a combo
audio jack USB type-c Thunderbolt 3 port
with charging capability HDMI and
another USB 3 port on the left thanks to
the 6th gen processor and beefy battery
even my Core i7 model lasted me all day
with ease the two fans that take in
fresh air through the vents on the
bottom then exhaust on to the lower
bezel of the screen keep the GPU running
at full speed and take advantage
that extra size I said I would get to
this versus the blade 14 to stay
reasonably quiet even under an extended
gaming load and like that recently
reviewed Inspiron they turn off entirely
during light use great the backlit
keyboard which thankfully using function
and escape allows you to default to the
F keys instead of the secondary
functions is quiet and responsive with
good tactile feedback and a really solid
feeling palm rest and the touchpad was
responsive with good palm rejection and
solid performance during two-handed use
something that many laptops that have
CLIC pads rather than separated buttons
struggle with which isn't to say that
it's perfect as a communication device
the XPS 15 falls flat for me
while it would describe the recording
quality of the 720p webcam as acceptable
there are a couple of other issues that
I have number one is that while I
understand that Dell had to move the
webcam below the screen in order to make
room for the infinity edge display what
they didn't have to do is stick it off
to the side because it looks like I'm
kind of staring off into the distance
somewhere when I'm actually looking dead
center on my screen so it could be
closer to this experience if it weren't
offset to make room for the precious
Dell logo my other issue is that the
included microphone is awful why wasn't
that put along the bottom edge of the
screen as well instead it's on the
leading edge of the bottom of the laptop
giving an extraordinarily echoey sound
even compared to other laptop
microphones this recording is from my
razor blade 14 so for those reasons I
can't recommend this device to anyone
who plans to use it extensively for
video chatting over Skype or hangouts
the Wi-Fi is Broadcom rather than Intel
based and while it delivered actually
awesome performance in my sustained file
transfer tests I have seen reports
online of flaky behavior on 2.4
gigahertz networks while using a
Bluetooth mouse the keyboard gets a
little warmer to the touch than I'd like
during idle and I feel like Dell might
want to at least give me the option to
fine tune the fan curve a little bit so
my hands don't get sweaty and
finally most of the accessories
including the USB type-c dock aren't
available yet derp which is more like
another organizational criticism and
less of a jab at the product itself so
in the grand scheme of things these are
some pretty minor complaints that I'm
taking into my conclusion here and here
it goes in a vacuum I probably wouldn't
be that impressed by the XPS 15 I mean
sure the slim bezel makes more of a
difference to the experience of using
the device in practice than you'd
probably expect but it doesn't do
anything else that's really that special
right well it's more complicated than
that because well it doesn't seem that
hard to do what Dell did here deliver a
solid product at a fair price it
apparently is because most laptops are
frankly kind of junky and when we
consider the rest of the market as well
the XPS 15 stands out from the crowd by
despite my complaints doing what it says
it will and doing it very very well
speaking of doing what they say they
will and doing it well deep brand skins
makes pretty frickin sick skins for all
kinds of devices they've got their
online configurator that lets you go hey
look this is my phone or this is my game
controller or my game console or my
macbook or well they've got pcs now
including the XPS 15 and you can
actually use that configurator to mock
up all kinds of different combinations
and skins so you can personalize your
device exactly the way you want to and
there's a practical component to it too
the vinyl skin that you apply will also
help protect your device from incidental
scuffs and scrapes something that is
great for something like a laptop that
you're constantly sliding in and out and
say for example a backpack or briefcase
so all you've got to do is head to the
link in the video description and check
out D brands high quality vinyl skins I
mean what are you waiting for go do it I
ran out of gas there on my on my spot
