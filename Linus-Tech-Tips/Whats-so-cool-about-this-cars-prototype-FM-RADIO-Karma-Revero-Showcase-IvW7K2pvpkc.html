the karma Rivera Aliso Edition it's one
of 15 in the world has 981 foot-pounds
of torque and costs an eye-watering
hundred and forty five thousand dollars
which is great and all but like we're
Linus tech tips why the heck are we here
ah there we go
so the back is filled of awesome
prototype tech so let's take a look at
what all of this does and a big thanks
to DTS and photo nation for sponsoring
this video
if you feel like you've seen this car
before well you wouldn't be wrong that's
because both karma and the Rivero are
heirs to Fisker Automotive Karma a car
about as troubled as the period it was
born in two major financial institutions
have teetered on the edge of collapse
and some have failed as a result our
entire economy is in danger the company
was plagued by several engineering and
production challenges legal battles
supply issues reliability shortcomings
and became a political football for the
guys in Washington and the financial
troubles that came as a result of all
that forced Fisker to shut its doors in
2013 but for all the things that gone
wrong
Fisker did get some things right the
accelerated development process of the
fisker karma generated quite a few
technological breakthroughs and the core
design of the car remains a thing of
beauty
even eleven years after its original
unveiling so it's with those
considerations that automotive supplier
launched own group bought what remained
of the original company in 2014 a mere
year after having scooped up Fiskars
then battery manufacturer and then
rebranded it karma so while the Rivero
may look much the same as its
predecessor it's a completely different
car under the surface everything from
the wiring harness to the solar panel
roof down to the powertrain is different
with some less obvious stuff starting
with the FM radio okay wait hold on okay
so this came about as part of Karma's
collaboration with DTS and it's actually
cooler than it sounds so the prototype
radio in here has album artwork and a
like button well okay but Spotify
already has that at which point we
realized well why don't we expect this
from radio the radio experience is
basically decades behind with
programmable stations still being a
feature and the thing is some 80 percent
of drivers apparently still rely on it
for entertainment in their car so with
DTS connected radio your car is able to
use an IP connection to download
metadata for digital and analog radio
stations so you can get album artwork
titles and artists the ability to like
and share songs and of course my
personal favorite the ability to see
exactly what's playing on all the
stations at once but maybe the station
you landed on is playing some really
soft soothing music you're driving down
the highway it's late at night maybe
you're coming home from the airport and
the incredibly comfortable seats at the
rivero ease you into a slumber your eyes
closed this is the situation where you
want the photo nation DMS or driver
monitoring system it'll step in and make
some loud noises to wake you up so under
the steering wheel we've got an IR
camera that can tell the car if your
eyes are open where they're looking and
even take a guess at what your mood is
now currently this just makes the car
get mad when you look away from the road
and plays a cheerful song if you look
sad though in fairness they only started
integrating this about four months ago
but in the future this data is going to
be crucial for self-driving vehicles so
the DMS will give the car information
during autonomous operation so if you
fall asleep it can park on the side of
the road or if it needs to hand over
control to the driver from autonomous
mode it can make sure the driver is
actually looking at the road and isn't
terrified before giving them control and
the eye tracking and head position
monitoring has another benefit that is
implemented today a changeable fov
backup camera so this allows for the
rearview camera to naturally update
where it's pointing based on where your
head is in the car this would actually
be beneficial in most cars I mean you
really can see a lot using the system
but in the rivero it really shines
since the swoopy rear of this vehicle
was clearly designed with looking cool
in mind not rear visibility may be the
most impressive part of all of these
demos is that they've been implemented
in just four weeks on completely
automotive grade Hardware like if we saw
this demo running on a tablet that would
be pretty interesting but these are all
real things
that have been implemented that you can
expect to start showing up in cars that
you might be able to actually afford in
2020 so in the trunk first we've got
power for everything twelve volt and
five volt to run the electronics and the
amp this black box here provides the
connected radio and the processing is
done by these SOC s from Texas
Instruments and all of this can be
pretty easily condensed down to a single
chip like not a single board a single
chip on that board giving automakers
easy options for smarter cars in the
future so thanks to DTS and photo nation
for bringing our team out to this demo
day you don't get many opportunities to
drive around a luxury vehicle like this
when well when you dress like us anyway
thanks for watching guys if this video
sucked you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
