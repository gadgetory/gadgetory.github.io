you've seen when it can do you're ready
to do your best impression of Philip J
fry
but wait AMD has left the keys in the
proverbial ignition and decided to keep
their frequency multipliers unlocked so
could you potentially save yourself a
hundred bucks going for the 1700 X
instead of the 1800 X and get the same
performance I always recommend that
before you start haggling with your
local CPU dealer you take her out for a
test drive so let's do that then shall
we welcome to our AMD Rison 7
overclocking guide
gee fuel is the sugar free energy drink
formula that can help you maintain focus
during long work days and gaming
sessions use offer code Linus to save
40% for a limited time so since we don't
have to spend extra on a special
unlocked CPU to enable overclocking we
can use any motherboard with an AMD x3
70 or be 350 chipset like our x3 70
based Asus crosshair 6 cool but what CPU
should we buy well AMD's own guidance
indicates that none X chips aren't
expected to overclock
as well so the logical course of action
appears to be to just crank up the
clocks on a 1700 X and save ourselves a
c-note but is it really going to be that
easy in theory yes but it's complicated
by the fact that Rison doesn't give you
very much control while you do have dead
simple access to change the multiplier
and the base clock the means by which
the clock speed or frequency of a CPU is
derived both in the BIOS and in AMD's
rise in master software you can't
simultaneously enable AMD's automatic
turbo functionality precision boost
rising immediately locks to the clock
speed and voltage that you set meaning
that if you want to actually match the
potential of an 1800 X Y or 1700 X we'll
have to be able to do up to 4 point 1
gigahertz all day long not an easy task
considering even the 1,800 X will only
hit four point one with XFR under
certain workloads out of the box so
let's get down to it then and see if our
1700 X has what it takes
using our usual rise in bench and a 1080
T I will venture first into the BIOS for
the greatest degree of control simply by
setting the multiplier to 40 and the
Ecore voltage to 1.37 5 we managed a
stable overclock of 4 gigahertz over the
1700 X's stock 3.4 gigahertz base
frequency not bad for a CPU that's only
supposed to boost to 3.9 using XFR sadly
though we couldn't push any further even
if we cranked the voltage to AMD's
recommended maximum of 1.4 5 volts we're
not sure why this is exactly but even
when we delve into more advanced base
clock overclocking we were only able to
eke out an extra 100 megahertz on the
CPU not really worth the time or effort
the same was true of our 1800 X which
tells us that at least for our chips the
limiting factor may be elsewhere armed
with this knowledge we now know the
relevant voltages and frequencies we
need in order to perform an overclock
first the CPU multiplier shown in our
BIOS as CPU core ratio this works in
increments of 0.25 and by default ranges
from 22 to 60 3.75 you'll generally want
to ignore custom CPU core ratio but if
you do use it you'll be greeted by a
multiplier called
F ID and a divider called D ID which go
from 16 to 255 and 8 to 48 respectively
to be clear the only reason you would
want this kind of control is if you were
base clock overclocking so you can
access it with AI overclocked tuner but
quite frankly we don't really recommend
it because it adjusts other sensitive
system frequencies like PCI Express for
no real-world performance benefit one
useful thing you can do with the AI
overclocked tuner is set what asu's
calls do CP which is fancy talk for DRAM
overclock profiles like Intel's XMP now
in the future you'll be able to use this
to set your high speed Ram to the
correct frequency
and timings automatically which is key
because Rison really does seem to
perform better the higher you can crank
the memory speed and the lower you can
get the timings but bear in mind that
most Ram right now is tuned for Intel
platforms so you'll need to shop for
special memory to be able to take
advantage of this and we actually didn't
have a ton of success running even the
memory that AMD provided or one of these
AMD specific memory kits any higher than
26 66 megahertz so your mileage may
significantly vary as far as that goes
in any case it's likely you'll end up
manually keying in your RAM timings to
get them as low as you can before
hitting a wall moving on to voltages our
main concern is v core shown here as CPU
core voltage by default when you set an
overclock Rison will snap to a rather
strange arbitrary voltage of one point
three six two five
as for what to set it to we found that
one point three seven five is the sweet
spot for overclocking with high-end air
cooling while Asus recommends no higher
than one point four to five with strong
liquid cooling D RAM voltage defaults to
one point two but most higher-end kits
are asking for about one point three
five if you do adjust this you'll want
to tweak the CPU SOC voltage whose
default is 0.99 turning this voltage up
can improve memory overclocking and for
us did seem to help with stability
you'll also want to set your memory
termination voltage in our case labeled
VT TDD are in tweakers paradise 2 half
of your DRAM voltage if you're trying
out base clock over clocks then you can
also find cents of my SKU here which
you'll want to enable for stability
though again we really don't recommend
this whoo okay so we're overclocked how
does it run well thanks to the crosshair
sixes am three mounting holes
we can test not only our a m4 based
knock - au 12s and cooler master hyper
212 + but also our Corsair H 100 I
all-in-one water cooler so we can give
you guys a good idea of what to expect
pretty much across the board for
temperatures under i-264 stability test
our hyper 212 + managed 82 degrees which
I would consider to be acceptable well
our knock - a rounded 83.5 so that's
warmer but it should be noted that this
was with a much quieter fan our H 100 I
meanwhile managed to keep things down to
a cozy seventy four and a half degrees
if you want to compare these results to
your own bear in mind that currently
AMD's rise in x-series CPUs are
reporting temperatures a whole twenty
degrees higher than they actually are
in some applications we took our
readings from AMD zone rise and master
software though so they should be
accurate as for performance at four
gigahertz our 1700 X sits at the top of
the x-class rise and line up for FPS per
dollar at 1080p a likely target for all
of you out there buying high refresh
rate monitors games like Deus Ex mankind
divided
rise of the Tomb Raider for honor GTA 5
and doom all showed close or better
performance synthetics like 7-zip PC
mark Y cruncher Cinebench and real bench
all showed the overclocked mostly
meeting or exceeding the 1,800 X
sometimes by a wide margin so combining
these scores and average FPS well it
gets extremely close to the core i7 7700
KS performance per dollar in many ways
actually the overclocked rise in seven
1700 X reminds me of the Athlon XP 2500
plus it wasn't the fastest CPU on the
market but it was fast enough for most
uses and could be counted on to
consistently overclocked about as high
as AMD's top-of-the-line and more
expensive 3200
back then on top of that like the 2500
plus it's priced just right for a wide
range of users consumers prosumers and
gamers so in short while some
enthusiasts might have hoped that risin
would overclock like a bat out of hell
and via return to the Athlon 64 and x2
days with AMD on top of the performance
heap that isn't what we got but hey a
chance to relive the Athlon XP days
that's not too shabby either so thanks
for watching guys if this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button maybe consider checking out where
to buy your own rise in CPU and
motherboard at the link in the video
description also down there is our merch
store and our community forum both of
which you should totally check out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
