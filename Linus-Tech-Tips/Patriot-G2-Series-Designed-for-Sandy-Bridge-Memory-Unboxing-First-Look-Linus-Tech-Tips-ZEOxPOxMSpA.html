they have a lot of different series of
ram like tons and tons of different
series am g2 and sector and sector five
and sector seven a different numbers
they have all these different kinds of
rounds and vipers and gamers and why
that is the question that is the
question I'm asking and that is the
question that I'm also going to answer
the reason is that they're different
series of ram are optimized for
different platforms so right here I have
the patriot memory g2 series now this is
kind of a sort of a value performance
memory so you don't have you know super
fancy heat spreaders you don't have that
kind of stuff going on but what you do
have is decent spec ok in this case this
is a PC 30 sorry pc3 12800 pair ddr3
1600 megahertz so this is a dual channel
kit and it is designed for the Intel
6-series platform so that is another
thing that you get by going with an
optimized kids so this is optimized for
the six days platform that means you can
use it p 55 just like you can use their
p55 optimized memory with a p67 border
with a z68 board but you might not get
the same level of compatibility that you
do if you use the correct ram with the
correct platform so inside we find
another retail package look at this as a
hanger on it how is the retailer
supposed to know that there's a hanger
inside fascinating you know what's cool
about Patriot actually I was on a trip
down into California a couple weeks ago
and I got to see the Patriot facility in
in California and they have actual smt
machines in their office where they were
producing memory dimms right there in
the USA go figure right I had no idea
they're actually one of the few memory
manufacturers so they don't manufacture
the chips that are under the spreader so
they're not a samsung or or micron but
they do actually manufacture modules in
the United States still they have more
manufacturing facilities overseas
was pretty cool you got did like like it
was just open and there's like a like a
line that goes along and then it goes to
do puts all the components on it then it
goes through the oven you can actually
just like stand there and watch it very
very cool anyway this is the g two
series so right here you see we've got a
fairly standard fare heat spreader on
there alright this is a ddr3 memory
module it is dual channel as I mentioned
before in terms of Layton sees these are
not to put super aggressive by any
stretch so 1600 megahertz 999 20 run at
one point six five volts so these aren't
a super low voltage kid either but they
are definitely suitable for intel core
i3 core i5 and core i7 processors on LGA
1155 so that is your h 61 h 67 p 67 and
z68 motherboards thank you for checking
out my unboxing at the patriot g2 series
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips and also please note that it comes
with an installation guide check that
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
