are coming to you live from Japan not
live in fact by the time you're watching
this I'll not only have come back from
Japan but also traveled somewhere else
and probably be back from there too so
not live but definitely from Japan I can
prove it look that's Japan and we're
wearing these robes so clearly we're not
lying and today we did something pretty
exciting courtesy of logitech we got to
tour the omron factory right here in
Japan where they make the roamer G
switches in Logitech's D 910 Oh Ryan
spark keyboard and it was actually a lot
more interesting than I thought it would
be it was kind of awesome stay tuned
so the tour kind of began in the lobby
and what I didn't actually know when we
showed up was that Omron actually makes
a ton of different types of switches so
automotive factory automation and then
kind of what we're mainly interested the
more consumer side of things I thought
they just made like now switches and and
not even then they have a whole bunch of
different categories for the types of
switches that they have with these
little delightful characters so they
have rocker tactile miniature special
sub mini and ultra mini and they all
have their own little like superhero
rockers the cutest mine rock well
probably it kind of looks like a pirate
except I think that's just supposed to
be an eye yes yeah no not really pirate
but either way they're they're supposed
to be superhero characters and I think
that's actually pretty awesome so next
up actually right next to the lobby was
the labs which we creatively called lab
1 and lab 2 - it's amazing so lab 1 we
didn't look at too much that's where
they do row has which is like basically
keeping hazardous stuff out of the
products apparently very important
validation as well as new material
development and then lab 2 which was
where all the super crazy bananas stuff
that we somewhat recognized was and was
the only one that actually had anyone in
it today although it was one person
sitting at the scanning electron
microscope looking at one thing so
apparently nothing failed that day no
they have a ton of a crazy expensive
machinery in here including multiple
electron microscopes like you just said
x-ray machines all those kind of stuff
one of them was 50 million yen another
one was 10 million yen and the total
cost of that whole Lab just lab 2 was 15
million u.s. dollars just in case just
in case something dies and you need to
know exactly why down to the tiny tiny
sub microscopic scale the 15 million
dollar just in case lab so then we had
the meeting where everyone introduce
themselves twice please yeah very formal
very formal we watched a video is
excellent video
products of consistent quality other
products for faculty information and
industrial applications members and
importantly good video very good video
on run next time you want to make a
video come talk to us
contact us first and help you out a
little we sort that out for you guys and
then it was finally time to get suited
up I think the best part of this for me
was a that they even had yes official
arm run branded like kimonos and then
the second best part for me was when
Luke tried to put on the
one-size-fits-all for Japanese people
slippers before we went into the lab
that didn't really work out also my
kimono was really short priceless flood
kimono just in case there's a tsunami
you're ready for it I'm okay
if we're going there Wow
once we're inside the factory I was
actually blown away by how loud it was
do you know what going on so much stuff
happening all the machines are running
like some factories you'll enter and
it's like oh they're only running two or
three lines right now it's like nope
Omron is 100% all time that's crazy
so we made our way to the very first
step in the manufacture of a Romer G
switch where they had like a metal big
metal spool feeding into machine um that
would then split it in two and then
punch out the like main design yeah and
then from there actually goes on to a
new reel but then gets carried somewhere
else in the factory so that's like some
cutting edge technology reel-to-reel
that's a joke so the next station is
where things actually got pretty
interesting and I started learning
things I did not know about romaji
switches so there's a couple machines
here and at the first sort of functional
station in the first one it basically
places a little like super tiny wipe the
second stationary checks to make sure
that it's there it's probably good thing
the third one phors it and tries to get
it within tolerances and then the fourth
one checks again but with imagery to
make sure that it's exactly all laid out
how it should
and then there's a second machine and
that entire machines job is to put
another entire set of these contact
points on which is something I didn't
realize about romaji switches all
switches will have a contact point but
like we just said there's two sets on
this one so if you happen to get dust or
some other type of material and one of
the contact points causing it to fail
the other one could still work and you
wouldn't even notice that there's
anything wrong with you people so
there's a redundant actual actual
actuation which brought a few things
that you were pointing out which is the
differences between Japanese
manufacturing and German many yeah cuz
we've seen a few factories now two
German ones and one Japanese and there's
no doubt that the Germans and the
Japanese are the most likely of anyone
in the world to let us see their factory
because they're clean they're efficient
they're organized and they're world
renowned for being great manufacturers
but we notice two fundamentally
different philosophy the Germans on the
one hand are like kind of measure fifty
times make sure it's absolutely perfect
cut one yeah and you look at the cherry
on X which there's only one point of
failure but the things don't die yeah
whereas the Romer G switch an arm Ron
I mean maybe and negative but maybe they
kind of accept that one of those contact
points could fail possibly possibly it
could but if it does well there's two so
we don't that redundant seen for you and
another thing I learned about Romer G is
at this station is this is a freaking
expensive switch the amount of metal in
that thing unreal
another real joke
but when they led us into a completely
different building for the next thing
that's what we knew was getting real
that's another real joke no okay anyways
the first day should it pulls those
contacts that we were just working with
downwards cleans them up a little bit
and I fascinated by that yeah you were
and then we saw the most innovative
human machine I have ever seen ever I
didn't realize that every Roemer juice
which is literally made by people
standing next to each other moving them
along the production line until they're
finally blown into the little trays
fertile Arita logitech by yours truly
that you didn't know that either
actually that's a bad joke too there's a
real machine behind all the people yeah
every rumor juice which does not come
with some Linus DNA and one this is
legitimately the coolest piece of
manufacturing equipment I have yet seen
this thing is balls to the walls bananas
and there's two full lineups of them so
station number one of this monster takes
all that metal from before that frankly
I was wondering how they get all that in
a CEO is pretty readable Peggy so takes
a little app before cuts it and then
positions the folded cut pieces
vertically a real space saver next up
those pieces aren't actually aligned
properly so it turns it and then kind of
mushes them together for that awesome
redundancy that these widgets have next
that whole thing gets picked up and then
placed into the housing that is fed via
a hopper system from the back with like
vibration feeding and then like an
automated orientation checking thing
that's actually pretty cool pretty
ridiculous next up was lubrication so
there's actually the lubrication station
there's actually three different
lubrication drug you are the lubrication
and that is where it gets a lot of its
70 million keypress validation from is
the this lubrication will last that
entire time so after a quick QC stage
not the final one by any means at all we
get to see the little rod that aids
light transmission added to the switch
so what's so special about the romaji
is that the LED actually shines up from
the middle
through this light dispersing rod and
then evenly illuminates the entire top
of the key switch a big advantage over
other mechanical key switches in the
market which are only able to
effectively illuminate about half of the
switch making them a little less a
little less even looking for lack of a
better word next up is where we get a
lot of the feel of the switch from so at
first we add the spring which just kind
of gets placed there and then
immediately afterwards they have the two
blue and white pieces fed from hoppers
in the back and then placed together
kind of behind the main assembly line
and then those two pieces go on top of
the spring compressing it all the way
down and that blue piece is just kind of
the top housing of the switch then the
white piece is actually a large plunger
this is again where you get a lot of the
feel from of a romaji
after the top and bottom housing or
clamps together it's time for the final
QC check the switch is pretty much done
so it's grabbed and then it moves
through a number of stations so that's
the first one it's a warmed up if you
know what I mean and at the second one
it goes through an electronic validation
of how the switch press feels to an
electronic arm then it goes into a like
a laser engraving slash photo validation
chamber and if it passes the validation
it gets a laser etching on the side of
the part number and the manufacturing
date where it is finally taken off the
QC carousel dropped on to an assembly
line belt and then blasted actually it's
awesome I love the little air blast
blasted by air into the correct tray
inside one of the bins for eventual
delivery to logitech what a cool cool
piece of machinery definitely one of the
best automated assembly lines I've ever
seen we haven't seen that many that's
true but those of you wondering what
happens to those switches that didn't
make it to the conveyor belt of epic
awesome win well they are validated as
failed and then pulled off the line
immediately and sorted by why they
failed
so if there
main reason why whole bunch of switches
are failing they'll know exactly what's
going they can take those back to the
lab they also don't get a laser
engraving at all so if your keyboard for
some reason have no laser markings on
the bottom it's made out of failed
switches that someone somehow managed to
obtain from a dumpster behind on run you
should probably get that checked out
yeah speaking of checking out we're
checking out and so the only folks left
to talk to you are actually some pretty
important guys that we met here from
both Logitech and Omron who want to talk
about a little bit more behind the
scenes what exactly got into their heads
when they win oh yeah
well let's just take gaming mechanical
key switches and completely reinvent
them which I actually discussed quite
deeply with one of them while naked in a
hot spring did you really I did that's
hot
it is it was so Logitech was looking at
the market and we saw that there wasn't
a mechanical switch that was built
specifically for gaming application
Omron is well known throughout the world
for building mechanical switches so that
seemed like a natural partner to build a
gaming switch from the ground up seats
new Hisoka close to time in law so there
was this original ticket like adding a
pool the Hancock will quote a sick kid
he is going to smita today the latest
news can total change over scenarios the
this project took us about via two and
two and half or three years to finish
the objective tour for building the
aroma G switches is born live longer
move faster and much brighter than the
what we have today the actuation
distance went to 1.5 millimeters instead
of 2 it gives you an advantage within
the context of a game to do your action
much more quickly than your opponent we
increase the durability by 40% over a
standard mechanical switch that's out on
the market today up to 70 million
activations in regards to reliability
there are two activation points so as
you're pushing down even if one fouls
the other one will continue to
activation so there's no risk of a lost
action and again
environment no chicks a mental partner
I'd say partnership with a mosquito net
to do with sex tomorrow
Corey Molitor has Monroes on Dana
Patrick oh sorry Nicotero quadratic you
know what I said certain winners</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
