so cool that it comes in three boxes at
the same time ah so this is actually I
guess you could probably do it in only
two boxes but this is the muskan
Copperhead memory kit and so I'm going
to show you all the things that it comes
with keep your eyes on the boxes which
one has what inside given that you don't
know what's inside any of them yet it's
going to be very difficult to pick out
which one has the sexy memory modules
and which one has the waterblock
that goes with them so the first thing
I'm going to show you guys is what I
have here these are I actually
specifically asked for very basic memory
but most of the Copperhead SKUs are
going to be very very high-end memory
and let you know PC through ddr3 2133
for example these are only ddr3 1600
kits okay so these are 2 by 4 gig kits
two of them for a total of 16 gigs of
ram and this is going to be for my
ultimate extreme build guide ok so I'm
going to have 16 gigs of
muskan ddr3 now the reason that I ended
up going with the ddr3 1600 versus like
a 21 33 or an 1866 higher spec like that
is that I opted for this machine to go
with higher capacity of ram so if I had
decided to go for a 2 by 4 so just 8
gigs of total ram then being able to get
it to run at high frequencies is much
easier whereas if I go for lower
frequencies then I can bulk up and I can
throw in four sticks of memory without
worrying about any stability problems
now here is where the magic happens
this I'm going to be careful not to
touch the top as much as possible is the
Musk an enhanced Copperhead waterblock
so what you do is you take these two
pieces right here which are spacers that
have o-rings on them
you put those spacers here okay you
screw your throw your barbed your
threaded barb into the top
and you can actually install any
standard G 1/4 fittings that you want
onto the copper headwater block but wait
there's more
you take the copper headwater block
alright so we've got our screws here
position it over top of a copperhead
memory module and you can actually screw
in any number of copperhead modules
whether it is three or four I think four
is the max and you screw that in you put
some thermal interface material in
between the top of the Copperhead module
here which you can see is flat and the
bottom of the water block itself and
that is how you cool your memory using
water cooling so what this allows you to
do is it allows you to install these
modules and then the block on top of it
no matter what the spacing of your RAM
slots is and it allows you to install
three three sticks in triple-channel
or up to four sticks in dual-channel so
stay tuned for my ultimate build guide
actually if you come over here you can
see my in progress ultimate machine
which will actually be a lot better when
I'm done with it so don't look too
closely at it right now
and thank you for checking out my

cooled memory kit don't forget to
