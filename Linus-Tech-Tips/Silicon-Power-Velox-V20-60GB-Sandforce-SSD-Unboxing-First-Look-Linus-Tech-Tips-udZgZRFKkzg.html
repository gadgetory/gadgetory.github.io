unbox today that is from a brand that I
had actually never heard of before they
approached me and asked me to do a
YouTube video about their product so
this is from silicon power and like I
said if you're in North America you
might not have heard of them so much but
there are parts of the world where
silicon power is quite well-known so
what I want you guys to do is if there
is anyone in the audience today who has
seen silicon power for sale and a shop
near them I'd like you guys to leave a
comment on the video and say where
you're from so that we can get get a
better idea of where silicon power is
popular so I'm just gonna go ahead and
start with the unboxing process here
because it's so shiny when the packaging
is on it so let's have a look at what
this is the first thing we're gonna see
here is that it is a two and a half inch
solid-state disk it's part of their
Belloc series v20 this is sand force
driven so that means we are using a sand
force controller this is a SATA 2 SSD
although I don't believe it mentions
that anywhere on the outside of the
packaging ok enterprise-class
cost-effective SSD built with sand force
controller it's available in a variety
of capacities from 60 to 120 and higher
alright we've also got Reed's up to 285
megabytes per second and rights up to
275 megabytes per second they cover it
with a three-year warranty it does fully
support trim and that's pretty much it
for the outside of the packaging so
let's see what we've got on the inside
with the silicon power SSD okay that's
it for the box we have the SSD itself we
have what appears to be I don't know
okay we've got an introduction okay some
some words of caution about not shocking
it with static that's good
compatible with SATA 2 ok so they
mentioned it here low power consumption
high performance low noise goal no noise
so these are all traits of SSDs in
general they've got a little
installation steps outline and then a
warranty card which you can fill out and
I suppose you do you mail it oh no you
can also do this online so don't bother
doing that
online okay we've got screws so we have
eight screws so four of these are going
to be to attach the SSD to the included
soon a half inch to three and a half
inch adapter and the other four are
going to be to mount the two and a half
inch to three and a half inch adapter
into your case so they've actually
helpfully labeled which end you should
point the connector on the drive towards
when you are installing it onto this
dried sled so let's have a look at the
drive itself here we are so it's got a
nice golden black label on it silicon
power branding
not a whole lot on it beyond that looks
like it is made in Taiwan okay so move
around to the back it uses just a pretty
standard black finish with with a little
bit of speckle paint so it should be
fairly fingerprint resistant I mean I
don't know about you guys but when I
install an SSD in my system I want it
looking pretty good at the back we find
our standard SATA power as well as SATA
data interfaces and in terms of mounting
we've got all of the usual ones so we
have four on the bottom and then two on
each side so what I'm actually going to
be featuring this particular SSD in is
the little guide because I've had quite
a few people ask me well can I use an
SSD for my OS and then can I use a hard
drive for my data so I'm going to show
you guys I haven't decided yet whether
I'm going to do it on a laptop or on a
desktop but I'm going to show you guys
all the steps involved in buying an SSD
adding it to your laptop or desktop and
then using your old hard drive for
storage don't forget to subscribe to
