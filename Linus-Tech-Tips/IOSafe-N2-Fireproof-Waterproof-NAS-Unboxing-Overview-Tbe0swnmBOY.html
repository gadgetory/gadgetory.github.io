card and USB reader for your mobile
devices check the link in the video
description to learn more about the
adata dashdrive air AE 400 now while I
love data security as much as the next
guy in terms of keeping my precious
memories safe it is still pretty hard to
get excited about an as because the cold
hard truth is they all do basically the
same thing they keep your data store
data safe by replicating it across
multiple drives they allow you to
centralize your storage in one place
they allow you to build a sort of
personal cloud so that you can access
your data on the go and all of these are
good things but the cold hard truth is a
lot of them are either let down by
subpar hardware there let down by subpar
software or they're let down by just not
being interesting or not having anything
different about them enter the i/o safe
n 2 totally different first of all it
starts with packaging check this out
that is some of the thickest closed cell
foam that I've ever seen packed around
an azz and there is a very good reason
for that that very good reason is that
this thing weighs a friggin ton it
weighs about as much sort of like cubic
centimeter for cubic centimeter as a UPS
oh and there's a very good reason for
that too this nas is fireproof and
waterproof it can handle up to 1,500
degrees Fahrenheit or around eight
hundred and forty degrees Celsius for 30
minutes at lower temperatures it can go
for longer and to put that in
perspective most house fires won't go
for longer than 30 minutes before a fire
department shows up and puts it out and
that's where the waterproofness comes in
so not only is it blood resistant
because it can handle 10 feet of fresh
or saltwater for up to 72 hours but it
can handle having the fire outside of it
where it'll be basically red-hot by the
time the fire department reaches it and
it can handle being hosed down at that
point in time all of this without
causing Gaeta to be lost on the drives
inside you guys you guys getting crazy
with me here yet alright
it's available in a couple of
configurations diskless or with discs
installed this right here is the
diskless one but the thing about the
install disc one is that I'll safe
doesn't expect you to actually continue
to use the mass after it's been on fire
and after it's been doused down with
water they expect you to send it to them
for data recovery they cover shipping
both ways which is very very cool and
they even send you back your new and to
so if it goes on fire or whatever else
they send you a new one they send you
new drives inside so your data is
completely safe I don't believe there's
any deductible on the first one but
don't necessarily quote me on that check
the link in the description if you want
more details so the in let's go
accessories first I guess so there's a
power adapter right there alright power
cord it's not some screws for installing
drives got an Ethernet cable got a small
magnet as well as an i/o safe disk and
this removal tool so it has a very
unique construction first of all the
entire outside of it is made of steel so
there's no aluminum screws even because
aluminum or plastic or any other
materials are going to have serious
problems at 1500 degrees Fahrenheit so
it's all native steel around the back
side you can see there is still a
ventilation fan and the way that that
works is they actually have vent holes
in the front that are built with kind of
a maze-like structure so that in a fire
the flames themselves can't get through
to reach the drives and they have to go
through the insulation which is has a
very unique design as well so it still
is allowed to have active cooling it's
got a power in at the back gigabit
ethernet to USB 3 points and a security
kensington lock on the other side we
find not a whole lot of anything and
then on the front this is where things
start to get really interesting power
copy USB to SD card reader and activity
LEDs so there's two drives inside you
can configure it in J bond raid 0 or
raid 1 and we are going to take this
baby part alright guys so here we are
the first thing it's just two screws
it's actually less complicated than I
thought we didn't really need to cut the
camera here so the first thing we find
once we take off the front nice long
term use ok there we go are the flow
safe
so these are the ventilation holes that
allow air to pass in through the side
here then along this drive storage
containment unit here and then out the
back the second thing we find is this
stuff this is their data cast insulation
this is a very unique solution what this
does is once it reaches a temperature of
around 160 degrees Fahrenheit it begins
to sweat water and so you can see that's
lining the entire inside there so what
that means is that as long as there is
liquid water present the temperature of
this insulation cannot exceed 100
degrees Celsius that's how it works
seriously go look it up if there's still
liquid water in the bottom of your
frying pan the frying pan cannot exceed
100 degrees Celsius so that Allah that
is what allows it to sweat it out over a
period of 30 minutes and keep the
temperature of the drives I mean a
hundred degrees isn't you know happy for
them but under control to the point
where they will still be able to have
the data pull off of them afterwards now
that's not the end of the protection
because just because you're fireproof
doesn't mean you're waterproof so that's
where this next layer comes in we're
going to go ahead and remove this allen
key screw right here there we go and
this is where you will find aha the
hydro safe barrier so this is the one
that handles ten feet of fresh or
saltwater for up to 72 hours or being
hosed off with a fire hose you can see
here now we get to some aluminum
construction so this is where the drives
themselves go remember these ones will
be at safe temperature so they didn't
have to build them out of steel
necessarily but you can see they're
designed out of aluminum for thermal
conductivity so that's the sled that the
drive mountain and then here is where
the drive will actually be able to make
contact with this shell around it with
the drive enclosure itself which is what
will allow it to pass heat using the
fins on the outside and be cool by the
fan at the back so keeping your drive
safe during a fire or flood is important
but you also have to keep them safe
while they're actually operating it so
guys stay tuned because we will be
torture testing this drive guys leave a
comment under the video if you have some
crazy creative ideas for
how you think we can torture it do not
forget to like the video and don't
forget to share the video with anyone
who you think might benefit from this
kind of small or medium business style
Nazem closure remember guys I did say a
lot of NASA's are let down by sort of
poor software or poor hardware
implementations this one has very
respectable read and write speeds and
uses synology software so that means you
can install apps and it has very
advanced management systems and all that
good stuff synology makes good stuff so
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
