first in a series of retro unboxings
okay so I'm going to be unboxing the
Asuza best value combo of PCI Express
solution
alright so this features a
state-of-the-art cutting-edge AI
proactive p5 gd1 motherboard featuring
the Intel 915 peach if set and I don't
know if you're gonna be able to see this
but see how much dust comes off this box
I found this in some corner of the
warehouse okay so this is a PCI Express
back when that was like a cutting-edge
feature okay and then it also features
an extreme ax 600 XT which is basically
a 9600 Pro adapted for a PCI Express
interface with with a fan on it so let's
go down and see what features are
included with this particular powerful
features a combo here so complete
DirectX 9.0 support excellent variety
connectivity with DVI ITV out and dual
VGA okay and then we have game face live
video so oh man that's dusty it has a
three year warranty which by the way is
probably up at this point totally gone
okay it supports LGA 775 Pentium 4 CPU
dual channel ddr3
SATA as well as IDE raid there you go
that is a feature I haven't seen in a
while
IDE raid also there are valuables inside
this box including a webcam and a
gamepad which are under one-year
warranty period which is totally gone oh
and it includes a free copy of deus ex
invisible war Wow Matt that is an old
game at this point so let's get this
thing opened up here Oh something about
wireless G cool alright smart doctor
stack cool alright so inside oh we find
lots of goodies so why don't we start
with some of the accessory boxes here
alright here's an accessory box this is
dick addictive ah this seems to be a
mount for the webcam okay and then we
have uh what is this ah yes the webcam
okay so if I could just get this open
you can have a look at this
state-of-the-art cutting-edge webcam
here there you go it plugs in by USB mmm
no I'm just kidding USBs was was was not
no we're not new then either okay so
we've got the webcam sorted out let's
find out what's in the next box here so
I don't even think I can like reach that
one yet okay okay why don't we find out
what's in this box there we go
so this is probably gonna be our
motherboard accessories with you I guess
haha so it comes with a very complete
accessory package including a driver CD
alright a user guide with a graphics
card driver CD ok oh and the user guide
includes a graphics card setup setup
thing as well just going to get that CD
so I don't lose it ok ah
yeah I dropped it forget it ok so then
we have let's see this is for SATA
cables and they come with little caps on
them remember that Wow haven't seen that
one in a while
2 more SATA cables so that's a total of
4 SATA cables alright it comes with 2
USB all in a joystick port port for the
back awesome awesome haven't seen one of
those in a while either - IDE cables 180
pin and 140 pin so that's for a hard
drive that's for an optical drive and
then a floppy cable ironically those are
still coming with motherboards these
days ok then we've got an i/o shield all
right we've got a DVI to VGA adapter ok
then we have all this is great this is
an s-video to composite output adapter
for the video card and last but not
least we have molex to dual SATA power
adapter because a lot of power supplies
back in the day did not come with SATA
SATA power oh this is interesting
oh this is nice I've never seen ok so a
Susi D sweet this comes with all of your
CDs in it that's pretty cool so there's
your day as copy of deus ex game disk
install this comes with a copy of a soos
DVD alright I actually have a copy of
this somewhere
with a laptop I bought in fact I have
all I have these two came with an Asus
laptop I bought years ago okay you lead
cool 3d se all right oh it's got some
more slots eh this is actually a pretty
nice little CD wallet there that's very
nice okay so I'm gonna just take this
piece out just so that I can get at this
one okay so in here we will find Wow an
impregnable box
ah I found it here's the scene okay so
this includes a and the Zeus gamepad wow
that's actually pretty hefty that's got
like a quality feel to it coz that's one
thing that they did do back then better
you know more heavy duty stuff like
everything seems sort of like this this
is making me sound old that everything
seems kind of like cheap and plastic
sometimes these days okay so this is a
dual analog game controller with four
buttons here it has turbo something
about analog it has macro support clear
oh and then more buttons on the back so
it has dual shoulder buttons it plugs in
by USB and it's got like stylish red
rubberized grip and then black
rubberized grip that's actually this is
pretty nice actually I I quite like this
that's pretty ergonomic okay yeah yeah I
could handle getting one of those for
free with my motherboard not that we've
seen an offer like that and you know Oh
years okay alright now let's get down to
the real business here it is the cutting
edge PCI Express graphics card Wow an
orange PCV excellent so it has a blower
design for the fan here you can see that
blows the air down towards the towards
the graphics port itself this features
the ATI rage theater chip which I forget
what it does at this point but it does
something relevant okay so like I said
this is an X 600 which is basically
equivalent to a Radeon 9600 so you can
see I believe it would be DDR memory on
the back here rated at hammer however
many nanoseconds would have been
relevant back then alright so there's
the video card and now let's have a look
at the motherboard so you can see we've
got all the features loaded onto this
motherboard let's start with the CPU so
it supports an LG
775 CPU but forget support for dual
cores quad course none of that nonsense
only single core Pentium 4s that's it
okay you've got support for dual-channel
ddr2 not three
DDR hundred and eighty four pin DDR
alright you have oh this is great
count them one two three IDE ports
excellent supporting up to six IDE
drives awesome feature right there then
you have four SATA one ports okay
remember we're up to say two three now
on current motherboards here is your
conveniently color-coded front panel
headers then you've got a couple USB 2.0
headers now in terms of expansion slots
you have one PCI Express 16x Gen 1 and
then you've got three PCI and two PCI
Express one X slot sorry did I say - I
meant three PCI Express 1 X slots your
power ports are conveniently located
with your 24 pin along the right-hand
edge and your 4 pin up at the very top
remember we're up to 8 pin now on those
guys all right and this is fanless
design 0 noise no moving parts so that's
your MOSFET cooler you can see we've
come a long way on those as well let's
have a look at the back panel ports ok
so we've got 2 ps2 ports now we have
normally like the only one okay we've
got a printer port nice serial port okay
then we have digital audio out then
we've got 4 USB ports I don't even know
if this is a Gigabit LAN but it's some
kind of land port and then 7.1 HD audio
so thank you for checking out my
somewhat dated unboxing of the p5 GD 1
and extreme ax 600 XT best value combo
