version of my BIOS upgrading guide so
I'm just going to show you the first
step which is go to the assess website
the next step which is go to services go
to support so more accurately go to the
asou support website I'm going to search
by product name in this case I have a
PAP 67 deluxe
go ahead and search for that yeah it
helps if you spelled the locks without
an R at the end deluxe er it's more
deluxe than the other deluxe there we go
so downloads
well the OS that I have is Windows 7 64
bit which will be relevant at all that's
okay
BIOS downloads here we go so there's the
BIOS update from April 1st hopefully
it's not a joke but apparently it
improves system compatibility Neto
alright so we're going to go ahead and
open data all right so it's just a ROM
file so I go ahead and put my USB thumb
drive into the back of the computer in
the USB slot okay got that on there
really I accidentally hit my outer
brightness button ok so now I just copy
this into the root of my Patriot Drive 4
Meg's this board uses an EFI BIOS which
means that it uses larger BIOS files
because it has a graphical interface and
whatnot go ahead and restart the board
so what I'm restarting I'm going to
press delete to get into the BIOS and
then actually this should go pretty
quick so you guys can just stay with me
here that's me a headphone told my
camera hello
please put something on the screen now
mr. computer oh and I missed it okay
I'll be back in a sec I'm going to press
the lead a little earlier so that I
don't miss it again just a moment there
we go here I am in the UEFI BIOS I'm
going to go ahead and go into advanced
mode because apparently it is advanced
to upgrade your BIOS I'm going to go
into tools I'm going to go into the easy
flash to utility I'm going to see some
graphical artifacts on the screen there
we are now I'm going to find the BIOS
that I just downloaded at some point
there it is I'm going to read this file
now my usual tips first of all before
upgrading your BIOS you should always
make sure that you're running at stocks
feeds on your motherboard so that you
don't run into any issues with an
overclocking setting causing instability
which could cause a crash or a
corruption of the data while you are
flashing the BIOS I also recommend that
you use a UPS or at some other device
that will ensure that your system does
not accidentally power down while you're
flashing the BIOS the reason for that is
if that happens it could also corrupt
the data which could cause your board to
become bricked which is bad still
flashing once the BIOS flash is complete
it will likely reset all of your
settings if you had any change so you
may need to reset your boot order or
change any settings like whether you
want to see your BIOS splash screen
things like that and that took a little
while now it's finally done so I'll show
you guys once we get back into Windows
how to confirm that the BIOS flash is
complete so here you go guys we'll just
check under mainboard and CPU Z to see
that yes we are indeed running the
latest BIOS on this board at this time
actually I'm just going to double check
that real quick 15:03
yep that's the right one so well you
might have noticed that the
change log for this BIOS was pretty big
that's pretty normal
so most manufacturers don't recommend
that you upgrade your BIOS unless you're
experiencing some kind of problem with
your system but my comment to you would
be that yes you should upgrade if you're
experiencing a problem with your system
but don't worry about whether the
problem with your system is actually on
the changelog because they're usually
incomplete and vague so oftentimes they
improve things that are not listed on
the changelog so now we're running late
espouse on this board thank you for
