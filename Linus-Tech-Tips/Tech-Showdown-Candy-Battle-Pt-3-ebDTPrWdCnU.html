actually you know scuff it up and then
use alcohol so the alcohol gets rid of
the oils that are in the plastic because
the oil is used as a release agent in
the molding process so when you try to
paint over plastic it doesn't always
want to stick very well because of the
oils and the alcohol will get rid of it
so a little kit
I think there's like a lot of the areas
where we're where we will be creative
and some of the stuff we bought to be
creative haven't even been really on
camera at all yet so we want to get a
super-clean battlestation super clean
build and then add the flourish and like
everything that's going to make this
thing creative and unique tech showdown
is brought to you by synergy 2 in
partnership with g.skill be quiet and
cable mod synergy 2 makes sharing your
mouse and keyboard between multiple
computers so simple that anyone can use
it
learn more at the link below so I'm
painting the case for you right now so
we're gonna do white on the whole case
but then we're gonna do some accent
pieces in pink so some of the mesh and
different things so we thought that pink
feet would be kind of a nice contrast so
just getting those painted ahead of time
oh fish eyes just get didn't get prepped
very good yeah so if you don't prep
something and clean it really good I
don't know if you can see it but so the
black little spots that you're seeing
are what's called fish eyes and so if
there's a contaminant on the surface and
you try to put paint especially if it's
like a oily contaminant it will separate
the paint from the surface and so it
leaves what they call a fish eye so this
is the front panel piece so what I did
was cut it down
we removed the actual door that would go
here and we're just gonna make like a
filler panel to set inside here so this
was on the front of the actual door and
so I took it off and it just had to be
cut down a little bit oh my god it's a
perfect fit okay we'll mount this in
here so it's permanent and then we're
gonna have to drill a couple holes for
water cooling lines and then some
mounting holes for the brackets for the
reservoir so our reservoir is going to I
look great with this so our reservoir is
going to sit right here and so looking
at the front of the case we'll have a
reservoir on the outside I do kind of
wish that I had gone with a white primer
if we were gonna try and do any vibrant
colors but if we do go ahead with a
chocolate round for real then it'll work
just fine
that actually looks super pro down there
all my parts drying I mean okay super
Pro is probably
one of these parts is touching the
sawhorse leg
ah hey wait I'm good no I'm using up all
my pegboard just trying to find a spot
for this to dry so my power button
and my reset putter still in here I
think I have an idea for how to mask the
loss though problem is we don't have
time to do like really tidy and asking
with you know razor blades and stuff we
need a piece of tape to cover what can't
get paint on it but I think if I flex
this out and I can slip this under it
actually we're gonna leave the sticky
side oh wow this must be the world's
crappiest masking tape brilliant so I
think what I can do is just stick this
in there and demonstrate once and for
all
that there's no problem you can't solve
by flexing out and sticking it in there
no it's fine I can work with this
because that is what tech showdown is
about working with what you got
in spite of Ed's best efforts to
sabotage everything you hold dear
no no no three cans of the of the
clearcoat yeah I think so like if we're
going you know shades of chocolate then
we might as well go shades of chocolate
like I really didn't want to get into
the whole like painting thing with this
project but these guys have forced our
hand a little bit like we can't show up
with a not painted system at this point
oh man i am i need luke to get back here
with more paint holy crap this painting
is taking longer than I had hoped
okay how long will you be there I just
I'm out of primer the multi tonality of
our color scheme is probably the only
thing that saves this chocolate idea so
I need to get literally everything taken
apart where we were pretty screwed okay
so I'm officially out of primer which
means I have to find something else to
do I'm gonna start with the monitor
disassembly so in terms of color scheme
for the monitor frankly I don't have a
ton of options we're going with with
gold and chocolate so what I was kind of
thinking was gold for this thin bezel
frame then we do a brown desktop
wallpaper then we do this stand and I
don't know like we could go gold all the
way and then maybe I could mask off like
like a jagged line
have brown come out the bottom or
something like that but I mean every
every time I add you know masking I'm
adding more complexity to something I'm
already not gonna have a lot of time for
move back yeah hey I have a wide mix of
news for you ah Oh what is this all good
though right
mostly uh-huh
start with the good and then tell me to
better I got a lot of track ok there
weren't a lot of trains that you could
put things on check this out I got the
logo off so we're gonna be able to put
that back on after we paid but I got
like this which i think is cool I got
this which we can unscrew the top off of
it and just things that bit cool so that
could like be pouring off like the GPU
or something out what I got a little
thing so if you want to have a pad on
top of the computer ok this I think we
could just like put some on it or
something ok I don't know
and then there's only like to the
eventually put things in which that'll
be the thing that pulls them
that's a caboose Oh push doesn't matter
we need one of the stack all right I can
get that later yeah might be cool yeah
the old fire truck sure and a little
ambulance oh okay yeah we need that yeah
our team needs an ambulance yeah okay I
don't know if this is gonna I don't know
if this is gonna translate to like oil
wrapping
but I'm sure gonna it looks okay wow
this is tacky dude oh no I'm not I'm
worried about me keep painting I'm
worried about us keep painting man don't
you ever think about us oh my god you
have the primer right only in therapy No
are you serious yes
synergy - is designed to be easier and
more seamless to use than synergy one
features include sharing from anywhere
with automatic control of any other
computer without reconfiguring SSL
encryption to protect your keystrokes
from attackers dynamic networking so it
detects the best route based on your

the background on all your operating
systems so you can set and forget and it
even works across VPNs and tricky home
networks if you get the pro version you
can get access to other cool features
too like clipboard sharing dragging and
dropping files copy pasting lock screen
synchronization and lots more you're not
getting no oh that's bad
I will go get primer I should i do Ace
Hardware should just go to Home Depot I
don't know okay is there anything else
you can do in the meantime uh yeah I can
keep working on the monitor don't worry
I'll find things to do a good cool I
swear I could have strangled Luke when
he came back without primer my level of
impress went from here here I cannot
believe he came back without the primer
well I got sick this morning which was
not good and I'm tired and I have to
like go around the city and stuff and
forget primer which was like oh the main
reason that I went into the store so
that was pretty bad so Luke and I
couldn't help noticing while we were
checking out they're super boring
generic candy color scheme over here but
they have four tables and meanwhile
we're scraping by with - so we've
liberated a table that's how we do in
Canada hey buddy yes we would probably
just ask for it look they're American
they wouldn't really like get it you
know hello let me just get this hanging
first yeah it's good okay so I just feel
like pink right everyone knows Steve
from gamers makes this it's gonna be
like picky on the actual computer but
what these guys don't know
a central bar okay what about it I'll
explain it in more detail there okay hey
super dope kid so we're almost done
getting everything painted we need to
adjust the ramp to monitor a side panel
and once we have everything under paint
we got to run and grab a couple things
that we couldn't get yesterday and then
we'll be back here and we have to lay a
second color of paint on our tabletop
and we want to try to get that done
about four o'clock which lets us let the
paint set up a little bit let's pull the
tape and then be done for the day and
let it cure
I bet you did
pretty good pretty darn good so it's
going to it's going to be a little bit
closer on the second code as well
because right now we have a lot of that
white popping through so you're gonna
see that it's really close we've
actually done pretty well we just have
so what we're gonna do now is we're
going to bond this little insert panel
right here that we cut we're going to
bond it into this piece and let that sit
overnight so that it's good and strong
and when we come back in the morning
it'll be locked in and will be solid and
then we can stuff it in yeah so loose
this is code number three of the monitor
this is the point where this gold either
starts to look good or we give up hope
on it okay cool yeah cool
the biggest surprise for me today was
how well the gold turned out I I was
Ruth oh I was pretty worried when I saw
the first coat cuz like you can never
judge paint by the first coat but it's a
clue
that looks pretty right yeah okay yeah
I'm actually done with that okay could
maybe use like one more coat but it's
definitely coming together hey one more
coat is a hell of a lot of use are there
easier than oh my god blow it up it's
terrible that whole thing that we were
kind of told we couldn't do I think
they're gonna go pretty far with that
you know what though I honestly I'm not
worried about that
well we assumed based on that we had
parts provided by sponsors so no we
weren't explicitly told we couldn't I
was I was told by you okay you know how
we observed that their system is like
really safe like actually like boring
I'm worried that they did that on
purpose what do you mean I'm worried
that that we're looking at sort of a
fraction well don't look at it then this
is a bad time to mention that I don't
really know how to mask and I'm just
kind of winging it I already knew that
okay if I hadn't already known that
before today I would have known it from
watching her do it so there's that I
mean it was based on your masking skills
that I decided to do all the painting
rather than hand off at some point might
have just damaged the finish on one of
the most important parts the frame of
the monitor hold on let me see if I can
retouch it while it's still wet I
believe
so Luke crazier thing um I'm out of
stuff to paint Mouse all right done do
you want me doing something else but
you're gonna have to kind of disassemble
it for me did you do the keyboard ah I'm
gonna assume that I did but I can't find
it if we use a bag to mask it off we tie
it nice and tight then I think I can
probably spray around it and hit the
frame holy crap it does look ridiculous
it looks crazy some mad scientist lab
today was a blur because I was doing the
same thing over and over and over again
and I was on paint fumes well that's
what today is gonna be like so I mean
sample size of one but other than me
spitting on it just now making
lightsaber noises finish on this looks
pretty good I'm I'm really happy so I'm
gonna start hitting this with paint my
goal for today is to finish painting
things so that tomorrow I don't have to
look at another can of paint speaking of
which what am i doing I'm gonna finish
taping off this power supply yes and
then I'm gonna finish doing some of the
stuff that we were talking about - those
tubes yes and I need that thing yes ah
ah yes the thing the secret weapon
ah so turns out that I had a thread
Ripper block on my desk the whole time I
don't know where they're gonna get one
if the competition was two days I think
that would look awesome yeah I mean I
like it I'm like pretty pleased with how
this turned out actually iron man yeah
man I bet that's not the team I can't
get any paint on where it is anyway so
are you good mm-hmm
okay yeah I contained it you don't look
that good
yeah I know I've like filled my mouth
twice in the last 10 minutes pretty
gross
yeah I know all right that needs to be
primed too so just the block and the
feet of the monitor and then we're done
priming okay so are we good for primer
then yeah we're good but if I did send
you to go buy more primer that's what
you'd buy right yes oh my god I hate
this nozzles also it's leaking at the
bottom frickin brilliant I'm trying to
imagine a way that I could be more
pissed off by having two bad spray cans
in a row yeah I think it looks
chocolatey I'm not gonna get after them
for the color I think it looks chocolate
I don't think I could be more mad right
now
well you and that color have had their
differences together something great has
happened
my hand my fingers are oh well our cards
dead okay you can use things yeah okay
we don't know it I just have to do all
of this over again
so our GPU can't be our cool than
anymore cuz we ripped off the fan header
which is like ridiculously on here what
I'm trying to do right now is get the
block part off of it because then you
could just paint this yeah I swapped the
other card yeah yeah hell yeah go over
some of this okay sort of I laid it out
on the ground but like sorry right now I
am trying to get a rough idea of how
this whole train track thing is going to
be able to come together I'm pretty
unsure but I'm gonna try to make it work
I'm still painting thanks for asking you
know what yeah let's diorama it up for a
little bit here just to make sure what I
need to buy we need to sanity check this
I don't want to go back to toy traders
if we don't have to so I actually don't
mind our idea at this stage we've got
the Train we've got the town we've got
the theme I think the system is going to
end up looking pretty sharp I still have
some deep concerns about the water
cooling because I haven't figured out
how I'm gonna make the limited amount of
tubing that we have work with the fact
that I now have to integrate a reservoir
and pump but my only concern at this
point is the legs our plan for the legs
completely fell through and we have no
backup Oh
bought some candy from the candy Train
and are gonna go to the park I guess
because they're not there yet because
they're by the candy Train
that that that's a dog the candy table
can't candy die it's a black licorice
dog it's not a black lab it's a black
licorice dog there there's a tree you
know I don't know what lollipop tree
it's a lollipop tree yeah and then
there's some strawberries which are
probably gonna be jube jube shrubberies
I don't know every previous tech show
down the setup has been that Lyons and I
go shopping in the morning before tech
show down actually starts and buy all of
the stuff that we're going to use
because we know the theme and then the
entire duration of tech showdown is us
implementing that theme that's it we
have one shopping trip and we make it
work and with this tech showdown we
decided to sit there and try to
visualize it or sit there and start
taking things apart while trying to
think of what we should do and I think
the best thing for us would have
possibly been to just go to the dollar
store and go to the other store and see
what we can find like we did in previous
episodes I could also be totally wrong
about that I don't know I just think our
theme isn't super great yeah so I've got
all my tape put back over the white area
so that I can just stay stay with the
same pink area that I had before and
tried to get it as close as I can to the
same edge so that it doesn't look Wiggly
or anything like that so it doesn't have
to be super perfect but I'm gonna go
ahead and just roll the pink back over
the top of this you can maybe see on the
camera there's some light areas and dark
areas and so you'll get that just on
your first coat and so on the second
coat and then if you go with like a
third coat it'll darken up more and more
each time so it'll it'll become more
solid
it is better but just magnetic so those
just drop off now we have our pink and
white mouse to match and they're ready
to lock into place
all except for it well it won't look
right on the inside corners window hill
Wow so this is an awesome fact only 60
calories contains 20 servings at 60
calories we have to put our steel
bendable rods into our lollipops so I
got to cut the dowel off and now I'll
have to drill a small hole and to fit
the steel rod just right
yeah sweet pinks a little lighter but
not too bad okay
a lot of pee first
the award is all pink keys white
keyboard and with the white piece of you
cover underneath we should get a nice
sweet blow from the gonna be a trick
what might be a trick to get this okay
oh why am i so long oh that's right I
left it long ago how do you okay so
here's the little box I made the
adhesive is still a little bit on the
sticky side oh nice dude what it's
awesome doesn't that definitely gonna be
sweet yeah alright I have to be bubbled
up to look really oh yes not quite
actually Colton actually thought we did
do it for a living
oh no we don't we have day jobs me yeah
it's something about working on servers
and stuff and he's like you what yeah
both of us do this as kind of a
professional hobby I think is the best
way to describe it we try to achieve
professional results but both of us
work five days a week and we're up here
all week on vacation that's a really bad
ugly contrast we could pull them we
could paint them the problem is
durability of paint but wow that's
that's hideous
we could just pull this front cover all
right I'm just mad adding the whole
thing yeah i'm have to do i have to fix
a couple of these will heights because
that phidias okay so yeah keyboard mouse
monitor tower Bob's an OCD freak with
working with him sometimes really
challenging especially since I'm not at
all
and he gets easily distracted but you
know having someone who's no sandy freak
on a case modding team it's pretty
valuable because everything gets put
exactly the way it should be on the
finished product and that sound means
it's the end of the work day and the end
of the show tune in next week when the
boys will assemble their final builds
and present them to the three celebrity
judges will hi Justine be tickled pink
will Central Park leave its mock on
Riley and will Steve Burke of gamers
Nexus be impressed by things that Steve
Burke of gamers Nexus would be impressed
by all will be revealed next week on the
final episode of tech showdown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
