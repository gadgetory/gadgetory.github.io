casio has sponsored us we did a couple
spots for there protract WS DF 20 last
year and I put it on for the photos and
then basically just never took it off so
if you were just here for the answer to
the question in the title I guess that's
it the casio protract WS d f 20 if you
want to find out exactly what it is that
I like about it then you can stick
around for a little while by Casio zone
account the WS D - F 20 a which is blue
rather than orange like my old one is
made for people who sound absolutely
nothing like me it's got a ton of
features that are designed for outdoorsy
folks like built-in GPS including
GLONASS and Mitchie B key support it's
got an altimeter and atmospheric
pressure sensor a built-in tide graph
and fishing time calculator and the
ability to see your location on your
watch either in near real time or at six
minute intervals on a full-color map
with topography and other notable
locations marked so I guess that's the
deal with the $400 price tag compared to
other rugged outdoor products it's
actually not even outlandishly expensive
and it does reasonably well as a rugged
item with rated water resistance down to
50 meters temperature resistance down to
minus 10 degrees Celsius and a mil
standard 810g design of course I've
never used any of that stuff so the
reasons why I like it
number one I actually get a lot of
compliments on the look even though I've
never really done a big watch before and
I have kind of small arms and kind of
small hands but people seem to like it
number two compared to other watches
that I've owned it's held up really well
to everyday wear and tear it still looks
basically like the day I got it and if
you compare that to my poor Huawei watch
or
yet that a Susan watch that I
accidentally took scuba-diving you'll
see why exactly that would be an
accomplishment number three the battery
life is fantastic since it's got a big
battery designed for using features like
GPS and I never used them so you can
actually expect as little as eight hours
if you're updating your location every
second but you'll get one day with more
reasonable GPS update times and I get
two so that's tremendous and number four
this is actually the thing that really
sold me on it I am a very forgetful
person and I don't always remember to
plug in the magnetic charger every
couple of days or pack it with me when
I'm traveling and so whenever I forget
the wsd f20 has two stacked LCD displays
it's got a full-color one that has all
the Android wear nonsense on it so you
got your Play Store and all this kind of
stuff and then there is actually a
second monochrome display and you're
gonna you're gonna see the the lit one
is going to go away in a second here
that's just a normal watch display that
way if your battery does run out you can
still tell the time and it lasts for
about a week from my experience in this
mode so that's pretty much it all I
could really come up with was telling
you guys about my experience using this
thing for the last six months and you
can check out more details about the
casio protrek smart at the link in the
