cool product from an tech these kinds of
devices have been on the market for a
number of years but this one's got all
the latest up-to-date features and
everything so this is the an tech
digital PC power tester so I have
conveniently a PC next to me I'm going
to go ahead and shut it down so this is
just a quick quick and dirty way to find
out if your power supply is functioning
as intended you know I hate plastic clam
shells that have these these metal
grommets to them so hard to open
Evon them just to get plastic to break
okay so let's see what we have inside
okay now I can't even get the paper off
that's okay all right so there's no
documentation they basically expect you
to know how it works here let's see is
this test your eye ATX power supply
quickly easily and accurately with an
Tex digital PC power tester the simple
tool for checking the health of your ATX
20 or 24 pin power supply diagnose the
problem and save time on troubleshooting
so a lot of the time PC trouble can be
caused by any number of things and you
have no way of knowing exactly what's
causing the issue so this allows you to
test a twenty pin connector it allows
you to test a four pin or eight pin CPU
connector 6 pin PCI Express and 4 pin
floppy and then I'm gonna go ahead and
guessed it in here is a molex no what is
that oh that's a that okay so there's
SATA on that side and then in here I'm
gonna guess this is a molex molex
connector okay so why don't we plug this
into the power supply that we already
know is functioning so that makes things
that makes life a little bit easier here
unplug that from the classified board
that I've got on my test bench here okay
so we plug that in just like that we got
the four pins so you can see the twenty
and four pins that's lined up there look
at that
so it gets the if sets the power supply
running so you can see the fan is now
spinning in the power supply even though
I haven't powered it on because it
actually shorts out the the pins
required to get it going okay yeah that
was awkward so it gives us readouts of
the five volt rail 12 volt one 3.3 volt
- 12 volt 12 volt - now this is a single
rail power supply so obviously that rail
12 volt - is not functioning 5 volt yes
bee and then I don't actually know ok so
let's see what else we got let's plug in
the 16 and see if it shows us anything
different oh ok so 12 volt - I guess
it's just it will read off another
connector you can see that the two
readings are exactly the same so that's
um something that would indicate to us
that it is a single rail power supply
you know what let's try something
completely different here give me like
just bear with me one moment I'm gonna
plug this back into the motherboard and
I want to try this while the system is
running and see if it actually gives us
any any readout I've never used one of
these before because I usually have just
like another power supply on hand that I
can test with so why don't we just plug
that all that stuff back in let's power
up the system and then I'm gonna go
ahead and grab another modular cable for
this power supply I'm gonna grab a SATA
cable okay the fractal design power
supply got here okay
SATA was on this side and let's just
plug this in and see what happens so I
think it goes this way yeah I think it
goes that way okay so it just oh this is
different so it gives us a little
indicator light so when you don't
actually plug in the 24 pin it just
shows you yes all rails are actually
functioning as intended so I'm guessing
it would do the same thing if you
plugged in say for example
a PCI Express connector so let's try
that - PCI Express plug in the modular
cable sorry this is taking so long I
wasn't expecting to do this aspect of
the test but since we're here we have
nowhere important to be why don't we
just do it okay so this goes in this way
and that tells us a lot less so it looks
like the these connectors only work if
you've actually got the 24 pin connector
in whereas the molex and SATA connectors
which are on the sides of the unit give
you more of an indicator more of an
indication of whether you've got the
correct power being provided so thanks
for checking out my unboxing and quick
guide on the Antec digital power supply
tester</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
