cool product from antec these kinds of
devices have been on the market for a
number of years but this one's got all
the latest up-to-date features and
everything so this is the antec digital
PC power tester so I have conveniently a
PC next to me i'm going to go ahead and
shut it down so this is just a quick
quick and dirty way to find out if your
power supply is functioning as intended
so you know I hate plastic clam shells
that have these these metal grommets to
them so hard to open I feel like Yvonne
them just to get plastic to break okay
so let's see what we have inside here to
start with besides dropping the digital
tester okay now I can't even get the
paper off without ripping it that's too
bad that's okay alright so there's no
documentation they basically expect you
to know how it works here let's see is
this test your I ATX power supply
quickly easily and accurately with
antics digital PC power tester the
simple tool for checking the health of
your ATX 20 or 24 pin power supply
diagnose the problem and save time on
troubleshooting so a lot of the time PC
trouble can be caused by any number of
things and you have no way of knowing
exactly what's causing the issue so this
allows you to test a 20 pin connector it
allows you to test a four pin or eight
pin TPU connector 6-pin PCI Express and
four pin floppy and then I'm going to go
ahead and guessed it in here is a molex
know what is that all that SATA ok so
there's sada on that side and then in
here i'm going to guess this is a molex
molex connector ok so why don't we plug
this into the power supply that we
already know is functioning so that
makes things that makes life a little
bit easier here so I'm plug that from
the classified board that I've got on my
test bench here ok so we plug that in
just like that we got the four pins so
you can see the 20 and four pins that's
lined up there look at that
so it gets the it sets the power supply
running so you can see the fan is now
spinning in the power supply even though
I haven't powered it on because it
actually shorts out the the pins
required to get it going okay that was
awkward so it gives us readouts of the 5
volt rail 12 volt one 3.3 volt minus 12
volt 12 volt to now this is a single
rail power supply so obviously that rail
12 volt to is not functioning 5 volvi SB
and then I don't actually know okay so
let's see what else we got let's plug in
the 16 and see if it shows us anything
different oh okay so 12 volt too I guess
it's just it will read off another
connector you can see that the two
readings are exactly the same so that's
um something that would indicate to us
that it is a single rail power supply
you know what let's try something
completely different here give me like
just bear with me one moment i'm going
to plug this back into the motherboard
and i want to try this while the system
is running and see if it actually gives
us any any readout I've never used one
of these before because i usually have
just like another power supply on hand
but i can test with so why don't we just
plug that all that stuff back in let's
power up the system and then i'm going
to go ahead and grab another modular
cable for this power supply i'm going to
grab a SATA cable okay poor got into the
fractal design power supply got here
okay theta was on this side and let's
just plug this in and see what happens
so i think it goes this way yeah i think
it goes that way okay so it just all
this is different so it gives us a
little indicator light so when you don't
actually plug in the 24-pin it just
shows you yes all rails are actually
functioning as intended so i'm guessing
it would do the same thing if we plugged
in say for example a
a PCI Express connector so let's try
that too PCI Express plug in the modular
cable sorry this is taking so long I
wasn't expecting to do this aspect of
the test but since we're here we have
nowhere important to be why don't we
just do it okay so this goes in this way
and that tells us a lot less so it looks
like the these connectors only work if
you've actually bought the 24-pin
connector in whereas the molex and SATA
connectors which are on the sides of the
unit give you more of an indicator more
of an indication of whether you've got
the correct power being provided so
thanks for checking out my unboxing and
quick guide on the antec digital power
supply tester</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
