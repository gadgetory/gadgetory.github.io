you by fresh books the number one
cloud-based accounting solution for
freelancers how long have I been asking
this question why is it that we can have
these super high pixel density display
okay so apples maybe not the best
example at the iPhone 7 but but these
super high pixel density displays I mean
this is a 2560 by 1440 display in my
pocket and for some reason it never
occurred to any genius to take a bunch
of these and build like you know an 8k
display the size of a PC well we can
stop asking that question because the
geniuses at Dell have bestowed upon us
the up-3 to one 8k this my friends is
the world's first aka monitor that will
be going to production sometime this
year it is a real product and it can be
yours for a mere five thousand dollars
but if the price tag was going to be a
concern for you quite frankly there were
going to be other bigger issues anyway
so number one is the actual reason why
nobody's ever done this and that's that
we didn't have a display interface
technology that would be capable of
driving 33 million pixels anyway what
are you going to do hook up eight HDMI
1.4 I mean that's that's just stupid
even now you're going to need one of
nvidia x' latest Quadro GPUs a P 3000
4000 or P 6000 in order to drive it
because it requires two DisplayPort 1.3
inputs in order to achieve this level of
visual bliss and when I say visual bliss
there's there's a demo one here that I
want to find here I mean everything
everything looks beautiful we can talk
about colored all that later but look at
this look at all these clocks I mean how
many clocks is this it's like sort of 10
10 so it looks like probably about 60 by
40 so this would be around 2400 clocks
2500 clocks something like that means
it's ridiculous you can actually see the
minute markings on them but of course
getting back to the whole image quality
thing BUP
in the product name stands for ultra
sharp premiere which means that it's not
just about the quantity of pixels but
also the quality so they've got full
coverage of Adobe srgb they're saying a
Dornier full coverage of Adobe RGB as
well as DCI p3 and also about 80%
coverage of rec 2020 it's a 10 bit panel
and the LUT is actually writable so
depending on what kind of a workflow
you've got maybe you've got a large team
of people that are working on some kind
of a special project to film whatever
the case may be you can actually program
the monitors themselves for the kind of
color space you want to use and then you
can move them around from workstation to
workstation without worrying that anyone
is looking at anything that is anything
but perfect now with that said most
people aren't going to need to do that
because every single one comes
pre-calibrated with a certificate from
the factory but let's say for example
you work with print you can calibrate
every monitor in your shop to match
perfectly your printer your camera and
even the type of paper that you are
printing on and they've made the process
easier with the xray taiwan pro color
imager which automatically fills in some
of the fields that would normally need
to be done manually to calibrate a
display so is this thing exciting
absolutely is it completely out of reach
for consumers for now I mean given we
might not even get a GPU from Nvidia or
AMD with DP 1.3 on the consumer level
this year absolutely but that's not
going to stop me from geeking out about
it because it looks absolutely stunning
