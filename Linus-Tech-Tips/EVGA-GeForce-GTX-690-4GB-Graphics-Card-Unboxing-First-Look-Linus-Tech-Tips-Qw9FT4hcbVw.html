unboxing of the EVGA geforce gtx 690 so
yes this is basically like a 590 like
you put it in like you know
multiplication machine and it makes two
of them so it's pretty much - did I say
590 cuz what I meant to say was 680 I'm
sorry I actually haven't slept very much
in the last few days and I apologise if
that comes through in this video but
hopefully there will be an update in the
next little while as to why that is and
then you will all understand I think so
this is basically like a 680 times -
almost it has all the same functional
units that is shaders or Opie's as a GTX
680 but the only key difference is that
it is clocked slightly slower now
remember that the 680 and the 690 by
extension have two different clock
speeds by the way this has a very empty
box like you know how I normally tell
you like the stuff on the box there's
like nothing on it they expect I guess
if you're spending a thousand dollars on
a graphics card that you probably have
some idea what you're buying otherwise
you wouldn't be doing it um I was I go
on with that right right all the
functional units it is clocked slightly
slower but not by much because remember
680 and 690 have two clock speeds
there's the base clock and the boost
clock so the base clocks are a little
bit different but the boost clocks are
very very close and these cards whenever
they are operating within their power
envelope arm yourself with EVGA very
very cool eh this is cool I have one of
these it's actually here let's go see it
it's over there that's what my GTX 590
came in sweet sync up my Nvidia Amal box
hey pretty cool anyway sorry yes the
showing off you know how it is um so as
long as they're operating within the
power envelope set out by the graphics
card it will operate at that boost clock
assuming no overheating as well so in
practical terms they are very very close
at 690 is very close in terms of
performance two to six ATS in SLI
consumes less power which is very very
cool and is also Quad SLI capable
without so many PCI Express slots being
taken out because you can run six ATS in
Quad SLI as well in terms of included
accessories we have a powered by EVGA
sticker that's got a very cool
carbon-fiber kind of finish on it as
well as a driver installation disc we've
got a little warning about how the card
is hot and be careful please
EVGA signature GTX 690 Quick Start Guide
ok enthusiasts built ok very neat couple
little stickers users guides as well as
a few accessories so accessories are not
expecting too much ok oh please for
Pete's sakes if you're running one of
these cards please do not use the DVI to
vga adapter get a real monitor ok DVI to
HDMI that might come in handy next we
have a dual 6 pin 2 8 pin adapter 2 of
those because this graphics card does
require 2 8 10 power adapters and my
goodness it's heavy holy cow
here you don't have to come in too close
just for the moment I'm just going to
wrap it here so you guys will see
actually something very cool
I'm going to leave this here for just a
second thank you guys take kind of a
close look at it I want to touch it too
much absolutely gorgeous so we're going
to do a quick size comparison against
the GTX 680 so that's one thing you guys
will notice it is a bit longer than a
regular gtx 680 but it also there's a
striking resemblance to the last
generation GTX 590 which is in similar
fashion to GTX 580 s pretty much but
clocked a little bit slower so you can
see ok here we go so you can see it's a
fairly similar design so Nvidia has to
vapor chambers here with aluminum fins
that have plexi windows don't worry
these stickers come off you could we'll
be able to see them very clearly so a
write aluminum fins on either side
cooling the two GPUs one other thing
that they've done is they've adjusted
the backplate that's under the fan right
there so that it doesn't have
absent it anymore this is in theory to
reduce turbulence so they just adjusted
the back plate so it cools the
components directly rather than
requiring that air flow they have also
changed the shrouds here this plastic
shroud BAM
aluminum as well as I believe I believe
one of these components is magnesium and
one of them of them is aluminum but
you're gonna have to forgive me I can't
remember which is which but the point is
that this is almost an entirely metal
card just because we can and it's a
thousand dollar card so I guess they
were able to to figure out a way to not
only design it almost entirely in metal
but also put an enormous glowing GeForce
GTX logo on it that looks absolutely
beast so we had a glowing logo on the
590 now we have we have we have
increased the size of that their logo by
a fair significant amount
it also looks quite a bit more sleek
some guys like back plates I'm
personally not an enormous fan of back
plates they do look very clean you can
see the 590 did have a back plate
whereas the 690 does not have a back
plate the reason for that is because the
690 is using higher density gddr5 memory
modules these are Samsung modules that
are running at 6 gigahertz there are
none on the back because they're higher
density so you no longer need those back
plates in order to cool them one thing
that's really cool about the 690 is that
it is significantly over built so it
actually uses a very similar overall
layout as the 590 in terms of the PCB in
terms of the power delivery so they've
made some tweaks but what's cool about
that is the fact that these dual the
dual graphics cores on this card do not
require nearly as much power as the
cores that were on the 590 so even
though we've got all of this power
delivery built into the card we don't
actually need it so NVIDIA has
effectively over built the card in a
significant way so what that allows you
is a little bit more room for
overclocking although Nvidia doesn't
want people over volting these I don't
know if you guys remember but there were
some horror stories where the GTX we had
some GTX 590 s die due to people over
volting the snot out of them and the
fact that they are pretty much a balls
to the walls take it to the limit
from the get-go so that was that was a
bit of a problem I wouldn't expect that
to happen with the 690 though just
because it is so over built
now speaking of over built let's have a
look at what all it's got here in terms
of the build so we've got three DVI
ports to DVI I one DVI D so this is not
going to work with an analog adapter
although you shouldn't be using analog
anyway so if you're going to run nvidia
surround you can run these three that
would be my recommended configuration
you've also got a display port which I
believe can be used in surround as well
but for simplicity of configuration I
would definitely suggest sticking with
three DVI ports especially because if
you're going to want to run 3d vision
you will have to use the DVI ports now
we've also got two eight pin PCIe power
connectors just like with the 590 and
let's just have a you know like a bit of
a closer look at the overall design in
this card it looks absolutely amazing I
mean even this not plastic guys made a
metal bit metal metal metal
I've got like these like aircraft
derivative looking things holding the
whole thing together I mean this is the
kind of card that I wouldn't even want
to water cool because it looks so
amazing with the with the stock cooler
on it and I've never said that before
I'm a huge water cooling advocate now
something to bear in mind is if you do
buy one of these you're going to want to
make sure you have an adequate case for
for ventilation because a significant
amount of the heat that it outputs is
going to go directly into your case
towards the front of the case which is
not the natural way that air flow goes
through your system you can also look at
redesigning the airflow in your system
so you can bring pixels so you guys
envision this for me okay so you got it
installed in your system you can change
your CPU to an intake and then the front
to an exhaust which isn't necessarily
ideal in the sense that heat rises etc
etc but it may actually help keep things
a little bit cooler and then the rest of
it is going to be exhausted of the i/o
plate out the back of the system I'm not
sure what else there is to say about it
so yeah in terms of length it is pretty
much exactly the same as the GTX 590 it
just looks way more slick I mean check
this out they even put a metal piece on
the fan just because it looks amazing
never seen that before but there you go
and then it is a little bit longer looks
to be about an inch longer than the GTX
680 so at true - in videos form even
with their dual GPU cards they try to
keep lengths reasonable without letting
them stretch out to be you know 11
inches long like the the Radeon 6990 did
I think that pretty much covers it in
terms of performance what can you expect
well single GPU performance is going to
be about you know 95 to 98 percent of
one of these and dual GPU performance
will be about 95 to 98 percent of two of
these except the key difference is that
you've got it on one part you save a
little bit of power and yeah it's
expensive but so is two of these and
that doesn't stop people from buying
them so there you go
thank you for checking out my unboxing
your first look at the geforce gtx 690
which is without a doubt the fastest
graphics card ever built and i'm going
to put a little asterisk right here at
the time of filming this video because
as you guys all know technology is
always moving forward yeah I let you
guys down a hardcore it has 4 gigs of
RAM see I told you I was tired two gigs
dedicated per GPU which means that
you've essentially effectively got two
gigs of RAM which should be plenty for
triple 1080p but you might not be able
to run like the latest games in triple
2560 by 1600 or something like that for
that I would probably be looking for
like a custom 680 SLI configuration with
2 4 gig cards just something for you
guys to bear in mind so 4 gig card 2
gigs per GPU</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
