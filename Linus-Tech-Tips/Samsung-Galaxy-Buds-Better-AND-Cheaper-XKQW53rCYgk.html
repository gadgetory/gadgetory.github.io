iPod or an Android smartphone if you had
a pair of headphones and a
three-and-a-half millimeter jack you
could always count on things to just
work you know like it's good jack and
nothing has ever made me appreciate it
more than reviewing Bluetooth earbuds
now it's not that the galaxy buds are
bad they're actually pretty good
they feature excellent audio quality a
great fit and near zero latency with
Samsung devices but there are some other
things about the buds that sour the
experience and when we've had this other
almost perfect audio standard for nearly
80 years is pretty good good enough you
know what else is pretty good our

now the galaxy buds are not Samsung's
first foray into the world of true
wireless earbuds their gear icon X
launched back in 2016 and was refreshed
again in 2018 they had features like
fitness tracking for active users along
with swipe support for volume control
and four gigs of on-board storage
unfortunately battery life is not so
good and the originals only worked with
Samsung devices for the Galaxy buds
Samsung took what they learned from the
icon X and made a more refined product
with more universal appeal in short they
dropped the internal storage added a
wireless charging case improved battery
life added support for Bluetooth 5.0 and
drop the price to undercut competitors
like Apple's air pods and Google's pixel
buds but that would all be for naught if
they kept that pesky Samsung only
limitation fortunately they didn't the
Galaxy buds should work with any Android
or iOS device even though they do still
work best with Samsung ones more on that
later first let's take a look at them
Samsung seems to have taken a lot of
design cues from the icon X down to the
rounded triangular touchpad and like all
decent earbuds they include three sizes
of rubber ear tips and three sizes of
wingtips to make sure that they will
stay in your ears
this made Riley who wrote this review
and his freakishly asymmetrical ears
very happy moving on to the inside we
find the charging contacts and this
curious little black dot which is a
sensor that helps the buds detect
whether or not they're in your ears and
allow them to automatically power on or
go to sleep accordingly battery life is
a strong point with six hours of music
listening time and five hours of
talktime but curiously the case only
gives you about a third of the extended
battery life compared to Apple's case in
spite of its similar size on that
subject if Samsung would have had to
increase the size to get more battery
life into it I'd probably have left it
the way that it is to as it is it slips
easily in and out of even very
small pockets with an exterior LED
indicating the battery level for the
case itself and an interior LED which
indicates the earbuds level of charge
now it comes in white black or yellow
just like the earbuds and if you've got
a Galaxy S 10 it's kinda awesome being
able to plug in your phone turn on
wireless power share and then charge
your earbuds wirelessly it's just it's
just one of those things that makes you
go nice something else that's nice is
the audio quality Samsung is clearly
getting their mileage out of their 2016
acquisition of harman compared to the
airport which to be clear are fine for
most people the galaxy buds can put out
a delightful amount of bass along with
full-bodied mids and balanced treble of
note however is that part of this
superior performance is just the fact
that you can customise your Galaxy buds
to seal correctly in your ear canal by
comparison the air pods don't really fit
snug and therefore let in a lot of
ambient sound now with that said there's
a clear safety advantage to being able
to hear the world around you
fortunately if you're into that the buds
have an ambient sound mode but similar
to the one that we first saw on the here
one from Doppler labs basically they
used their two external microphones to
record the noise around you and pass it
through the speakers that are right in
your ear holes overall we found that it
didn't interfere too much with music
quality and it was helpful especially in
an office environment to know if
someone's yelling your name from across
the room now let's move on to the app
it's not available for iOS which blows
but other than that it's pretty cool
it's actually got some great features so
you can adjust your EQ we liked the
dynamic and clear presets best you can
update your firmware without any voodoo
magic you just press a button called
update firmware like every other tech
product Thank You Samsung I didn't think
this needed to be a good thing but there
you go and this is a really cool one you
can actually both see your buds battery
level and locate them by playing a
high-pitched chirping noise it's almost
like Samsung gives a crap if you
them and wants to help you cool also
from in there you can customize some of
the buds touch gestures you cannot
change the single tap to pause or play
and that's on both sides the double tap
to skip a track or the triple tap to go
to the previous track but you can assign
the long-press action to activate your
voice assistant of choice it even works
with Alexa turn volume up or down or
Tran ambient sound on or off
now each earbuds long press action is
independent of the other so you can set
them to do different things that is
unless you want to use them for volume
control in which case the right earbud
has to be volume up while the left one
is volume down as with the air pods you
can turn the volume up down or to a
specific percentage with your voice just
watch out though because the buds
themselves still don't have voice
activation so if your phone's mic can't
hear you then you'll have to summon
Cortana manually with a long press I'm
just kidding Cortana sucks now overall
our experience with the galaxy buds has
been pretty freakin sweet but there are
a few flies in this mostly happy women
just like the air pods and Apple devices
the galaxy buds work best with Samsung
devices and while that kind of a phrase
can often be taken as just marketing I
mean of course Samsung wants you to buy
all the Samsung products it's really
true here the galaxy wearable app is
pre-installed on Samsung phones allowing
you to instantly pair by opening the
case while other users of Android phones
will need to install the app and as we
mentioned before iPhone users can't get
it at all so they can't customize their
gestures even and while latency is near
zero with a Galaxy S 10 it's very
noticeable on the pixel free and even
more so on the iPhone 10 are that we
used and the thing is while we didn't
experience any glitchyness while
listening on the iPhone or on the S 10
our music tended to glitch out much more
frequently on the pixel 3 especially
when walking around with the earbuds in
ears and then the pixel 3 in a front
pocket another big negative and this was
actually true on all devices was the
call quality now it's
in a quiet environment I was trying to
talk to you guys in our studio here that
would be just fine but if you're outside
or in a busy room
pretty much good luck having a coherent
conversation so no matter how advanced
Bluetooth earbuds get with their gesture
controls and advanced features it's the
little issues like this that always make
me kind of long for the simplicity of a
headphone jack I mean don't get me wrong
I know that by the time this zipper
finally really wears out I'm gonna have
to replace these I guess I just wish
that the technology had matured a little
more before we started you know yanking
the three-and-a-half millimeter ports
out of our phones so the community over
at drop comm asked for a closed back
headphone with excellent price to
performance and they're about to get it
with the Fox Tech's TR XO o ebony
headphones they're based on a model
first developed in the late 80s with a
lightweight magnesium alloy frame evany
wood ear cups and breathable material on
the ear pads so you can listen for hours
in comfort they also feature higher flux
density audio drivers crisp and detailed
sound signature and a rich base that
doesn't become bloated so check it out
at the link below so thanks for watching
guys if you disliked this video you can
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link down below also
down there is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one by the way and
our community forum which is definitely
worth a joint these things aren't like
really comfortable by the way totally
forgot I had them in while I was just
talking to you guys it's nice
