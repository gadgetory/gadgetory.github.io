widest monitor yet
LG's 38 you see 99 boasts 38 inches of
productivity and gaming goodness with
higher resolution higher refresh rate
more inputs and AMD freesync among the
improvements they've made since I first
laid eyes on the 34 you see 97 that's
been my daily driver at the office since
its released nearly two years ago but is
it really a step forward can a monitor
be simply too big no spoilers so for now
the answer is maybe
the dark Bass Pro 900 from be quiet
features a modular design to support a
variety of layouts and configurations
check out the link in the video
description to learn more
let's open with the speeds and feeds the
38 you see 99 rocks a curved IPS 100%
srgb rated panel with max brightness
that exceeds its 300 NIT rating in my
testing and that I would describe as
freaking bright I use dark room profile
1 most of the time in my office it runs
at a native resolution of 3840 by 1600
which is about 3/4 as many pixels as UHD
and it uses the extra bandwidth that it
saves to break the 60 Hertz barrier and
offer up a 75 Hertz maximum refresh rate
on either its DP 1.2 or USB type-c port
very refreshing
all of this amounts to nearly exactly
the same pixel density as the older 34
inch 1440p models and going further back
in time the 16 by 10 30 inch monitors
that were hugely popular among ball and
a spoilers about 10 years ago for good
reason it is a great sweet spot because
it's basically as fine as you can go
with felt scaling something that Windows
8 and prior handled very poorly and even
on Windows 10 is imperfect at least from
a normal distance I found that with the
UC 99 I needed to sit a little further
back than I normally do to avoid
significant head movements to interact
with on-screen elements in the corners
hmm let's continue for IO we've got a
headphone jack DP 1.2 dual HDMI 2.0 USB
type-c that access both an uplink for
the Android BC 1.2 fast charge
supporting hub and as an alternate plug
for the DisplayPort input and on the
software side LG's on-screen control has
many more
window arrangement modes and basically
did what it was supposed to so no
complaints here the stand though is one
step forward one step back I am oh the
display clicks into it with no tools
required thumbs up and the couple
degrees of pivot adjustment actually
makes it easier to compensate for slight
misalignment but whether it's due to the
weight of the panel or the plastic arm
I wasn't especially pleased with the
screen wobble that I experienced while
typing at my desk not on such a premium
product the on screen menu is snappy to
navigate thanks to the four direction
nipple button interface and much quicker
onboard processor but to take it one
step further I really like to see
programmable shortcuts as it is left and
right our volume adjustments which makes
sense but up and down both just show me
my current input and current image
profile while clicking the nipple brings
up mostly sensible options Bluetooth
audio is a neat feature that lets you
use the you c99 fairly decent speakers
with your phone over bluetooth for me
that one would come up a lot less often
than wanting to toggle the motion blur
reduction mode that claims as low as one
millisecond perceived pixel response
times when you're running at the maximum
75 Hertz refresh rate over DisplayPort
the principle here is similar to Nvidia
slight boost it rapidly strobes the
backlight simulating the way that a CRT
works which results in a noticeable
improvement in image sharpness during
quick movements in games but it looks
like flickering but outside of games and
costs 16 interactions with the menu
button every time you want to toggle it
this could be addressed by the on-screen
control application that at least allows
picture modes to be adjusted a little
more quickly but at this time that only
supports a small subset of the monitors
onboard controls so some convenience and
comfort enhancing features are stuck
buried so deep that I suspect many
owners of this display will
ever even find them I'd like to see some
improvement there while we're at it
LG's dual link-up picture by picture
mode is another great example of solid
idea B - implementation it lets you pull
up plug in a compatible type C port and
boom with that one cable you can have
your desktop on the one side you're
plugged in peripherals in the monitor
working on your laptop and your laptop
displayed on the other side and it
charges laptops up to 60 watts - with
synergy this amazing network mouse and
keyboard sharing software that loop
showed off here this could be an amazing
use case for folks like me who still use
their laptop while they're out and about
but prefer to sit at the desktop in the
evening again though I can't make this
the default behavior for when I plug
something in and it's 11 clicks to
toggle it every time not to mention that
if you're using DisplayPort for your
desktop for that seventy five Hertz
refresh rate you will need to use HDMI
for your laptop not the type C input the
two DP inputs cannot be used
concurrently and while I'm at boneheaded
slip-ups in the attention to detail
Department what the actual hell were
they thinking putting a persistence icon
in the bottom right of my screen when I
have Bluetooth audio playing I mean if
you must have an indicator so that I
don't get confused and call support
complaining that my speakers aren't
working make it pop up when I adjust the
volume or have a small LED off screen
anything else would have been better
than that on to the positive stuff
though performance of the panel can't
really be faulted backlight bleed was
within reason and subjectively viewing
angles and uniformity were very strong
points especially for a display of this
size with color accuracy out of the box
in the custom profile of all things
being pretty darn close but it does feel
a little like LG tried to be everything
to everyone and ended up achieving only
80% of every category they're trying to
sell the
extra screen real estate to content
creators but this is a $1,500 srgb panel
at the dawn of the age of HDR but while
the 75 Hertz refresh rate is an absolute
godsend for gamers you can hate on this
all you want but I'm not convinced too
many of the folks gaming at near 4k
resolutions are running AMD Hardware
these days and I'd have preferred to
separate SKUs and at least 10 bit Adobe
RGB preferably rec.709 content creation
model and a more gamer specific one with
g-sync
rather than free sync so LG's not going
to like this but while the increased
size of the 38 you see 99 makes the 3 by
1 vertical layout noticeably more usable
which is a definite plus overall I found
myself either sitting back further or
moving my head more like I would with a
multi-monitor setup rather than being
able to take it all in like I can with
its 34 inch cousin and I'm not a hundred
percent sure that I prefer that it's not
that it's a bad monitor at all it's in
my top 5 probably even my top 3 but
maybe I just came into this expecting an
entirely new computing experience like
LG has done to me in the past and when
that wasn't what I got I was easily
annoyed by small oversights that could
have been avoided by talking to me for
an hour before beginning the product
development cycle though I would love to
hear from you guys in the comments if
you think I completely missed the mark
and Jake internally here has already
informed me that for his brother this
would be amazing because he works on
circuit design and the bigger the screen
the better speaking of missing the mark
you'd be missing the mark if you weren't
using Braintree for your mobile app if
you're looking for a simple payment
solution with the Braintree V dot 0 SDK
which is one small snippet of code you
can be all set up in less than 10
minutes and if it takes you more than 10
minutes all you're going to do is go a
bit that's ok I give up on this call
their support staff and they will be
happy to walk you through the process
over the phone their code supports
Android
iOS and JavaScript clients and they have
SDKs in seven programming languages they
make it easy to offer multiple mobile
payment types including PayPal Apple pay
Bitcoin venmo Android pay credit cards
and more all of this with a single
integration so to learn more and to get
your first 50,000 dollars in
transactions with no fees go to
