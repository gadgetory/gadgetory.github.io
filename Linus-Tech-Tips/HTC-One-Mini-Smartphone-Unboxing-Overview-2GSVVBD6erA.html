gets featured on the when show build
logs of the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it welcome to an unboxing that I am
super stoked on or at least I was until
I broke open the seal on it and actually
played around with it a fair bit before
I got started this is the HTC One mini
and this particular one is an AT&amp;amp;T
version from the US so if you're here in
Canada then I have no idea how you get
one comes with a little bit of
documentation wow that's in there really
good comes with a phone that you have to
like actually legit pull on the tab in
order to remove comes with HTC's sim
changing tool which is holy crap it's
like they don't want you to take this
thing apart it comes with a wall wart
some HTC stickers and a micro USB cable
really wish microUSB would go away or at
least be replaced by something better
but that is fine
so yeah the HTC One mini let's go ahead
and turn this baby on and go through
what is interesting and not interesting
about it so let's start with the
hardware spec I was probably being
unrealistic but when I first heard about
the one mini I was really expecting this
but smaller and that really isn't what
happened so of course it's a smaller
screen this I understand is a 4.3 versus
a 4.7 inch display and in terms of real
size that makes more of a difference
than you'd think
point four inches does so there's our
size comparison against the full-sized
HTC One it also downgrades to a 720p
screen which I don't mind yet again
because the display density is still
very good because it's smaller so you
don't see any of the individual pixels
but what I really didn't like was the
downgrade to a super LCD to display this
gives it still great viewing angles but
somewhat yellowish whites somewhat less
deep blacks as well as a noticeable
difference in color depth which is
mostly noticeable when you're looking at
things like a list of emails where
they're color-coded you know off-white
for on
and white four red and it's a little bit
harder to tell the difference and it's
not a huge deal you can tell the
difference unlike older TN LCDs on
computers but it just is a little bit
more fatiguing it still has the two
front-facing boomsound speakers although
they really don't go as loud as the ones
built into the original one and it still
has the ultra pixel camera if I was
gonna say there's something that I
really do like about this phone it's the
fact that it still has that four
megapixel camera with large pixels and
the F 2.0 aperture meaning you get great
low-light performance but it lacks the
optical image stabilization of the HTC
one CPU why is the one mini used as an S
400 1.4 gigahertz dual core versus the
1.7 gigahertz quad-core s 600 in the HTC
One and this brings with it a couple of
other disadvantages as well so it uses
an Adreno 305 GPU which is much less
powerful but less of a big deal than you
might think because a 720p display has
fewer than half as many pixels as a
1080p display so if you're gaming you
don't actually need the horsepower to
nearly the same extent but it also means
that it uses a different SOC that
doesn't include wireless AC support
which is pretty awesome with the HTC One
it's just faster Wi-Fi if you happen to
have an AC router so it only goes up to
Wireless n you use the Sense 5 and runs
Android 4.2.2
and it has an 1800 milliamp hour battery
which combined with the lower power
requirements gives it similar battery
life to the one which I usually get
through a day so there's one out of
maybe twenty days that I don't make it
all the way to the end of the day with
the one and that's usually when I'm
using it pretty heavily software wise
let's talk about Zoe's so the camera is
I really like the camera those are
something that I don't use a whole lot
so it's this little button over here and
it allows you to take short little
whoops sorry it allows you to take short
little video clips that basically are
supposed to capture a snippet of life to
me I feel like if I wanted to do that in
much the same way that if I wanted to
upload a short video to vine I would
just upload a short video to YouTube if
I wanted to do that I would just record
a short video and then I would use their
excellent highlight reels feature in
order to in order to review it and
highlight rules has actually gotten
better already so it takes your pictures
and videos from a given event or
location and then puts them into a nice
little thirty second thing that has some
like panning effects and zooming effects
and stuff like that it puts it to music
and starting with the HTC One mini you
no longer are stuck with the music that
comes on the phone you can actually pick
your own music and have your highlight
reel go along to that now let's get into
blinkfeed which is supposed to be a big
selling point of sense I personally
don't use it at all I'm more of a
content creator as opposed to a Content
consumer so if I had a lot of people
that I followed I'm much more likely to
use blinkfeed but I tend to go straight
to the sources for things that I'm
interested in knowing about so maybe I'm
a bit old-fashioned that way but I don't
use blinkfeed at all one-hand usage this
is where we're getting into things that
I start to really like about the phone
it's really really nice when doing
something as simple as typing a text
message to actually be able to reach
that cue button I don't need it often
but when I do need the cue button I
really need to press it with that said
it's not perfect the plastic band around
the outside of the phone is very glossy
and actually quite slippery to the point
where I honestly had a little bit of
trouble holding on to it even though it
is much smaller why don't we take this
as an opportunity to talk about
something else I really liked which is
the industrial design of the phone it's
much much more beautiful than something
like the Samsung Galaxy s4 which borrows
a lot of the plastic elements from the
full-sized s4 it's got that beautifully
finished aluminum on the back it's got
the aluminum front pieces here where the
speaker grills however the speaker girls
are not manufactured with the same level
of precision as the HTC One you can see
the spacing is actually less dense I do
know that this was a challenge to get
those micro holes drilled back closely
together and one thing that did sort of
acne a little bit was there's a lip on
the plastic here so you can actually
hear that so it's not quite completely
flush along the front of the phone
although the knot is pretty
straightforward there's your microUSB on
the bottom and your volume rocker
switches on the side yet another thing I
really liked vastly improved the volume
switches on the HTC One are really hard
to feel when you're touching them and
which one you're touching and you know
how uncomfortable they feel about you
touching them on the top you've got your
headphone microphone combo jack as well
as your lock switch which I also feel is
an improvement over the flush mounted
one on the HTC One your Micro SIM slot
on the side and other than that yeah
front facing camera light sensor back
face
all these all these good things
beatsaudio is still completely
unnecessary you should just pick up an
audio player with an EQ such as power
amp and you can go ahead and set that up
and it does come with 25 gigabytes of
dropbox so let's get into the more of
the review e stuff the things I liked
and didn't like let's talk about the
screen 720p is a great resolution for a
screen this size however the super LCD
to screen here just is plain not as good
as the one on the HTC one I didn't find
it bothered me just looking at it but
when I compare them side-by-side and I
go oh man was really not that much more
expensive it's hard to justify going
with this the camera really liked it all
it lacks is optical image stabilization
and I have pretty steady hands and often
I find optical image stabilization
particularly when it's not really well
implemented like on our XA $22,000
camera
bothers me more than anything else
because it makes it really jerky when
I'm tanning the idæan materials are
excellent the front-facing speakers are
not quite HTC one level they're really
not but it is a way to achieve better
sounding sound without putting like a
huge oversized speaker like what Samsung
did with the note 2 let's move into what
I didn't like I don't like the variety
there's a 16 gig SKU and a 16 gig SKU
and that is it I understand why they did
it if they offered a 32 gig SKU they'd
probably have to charge about another
hundred dollars for it which remove it
pretty darn close and pricing to the
regular one and at that point you are
getting so much more for your money here
this just would feel ridiculous I think
HTC wisely decided that that SKU didn't
make any sense because it probably
wasn't gonna sell this is a more value
oriented SKU not necessarily for people
buying a standalone phone but more for
people buying on contract where we're
not talking the difference between you
know five hundred dollars and four
hundred dollars are actually the
difference is a bit bigger than that but
we're talking the difference between
like two hundred dollars on contract and
a hundred dollars on contract or fifty
dollars on contract that's who the phone
is targeted the typical slower support
for Android updates for lower end models
4.3 is rolling out to the one I've seen
absolutely no word of it for the one
mini although it is a very new phone so
we'll see and the typical much lower
spec please anyone who's listening make
a high-end smaller Android phone I beg
of you it would be great one that really
feels premium
but I mean I understand why it's not
done honestly I didn't feel it in day to
day use that it was slower than the one
or bothered me it's butter smooth to use
the only exception being when you're
installing an application in the in the
background and you're doing something
intensive in the foreground you can feel
it a little bit but there's more factors
than just CPU speed and RAM for that
sometimes the speed of the emmc flash
drives that they're using on these
things can be a big factor there as well
though I haven't tested the speed on
this one
no expandable storage still and the
camera app just really isn't that
fantastic aside from having support for
those I find their gallery app is better
than their camera app changing settings
you have to dig pretty deep within the
menus to make changes and things like
their their white balance for video
isn't always great indoors so you have
to change it to like tungsten or
something like that to get reasonable
white balance seen better ones it's not
the worst thing ever but let's move this
into discussing the whole form factor
thing 4.3 inches versus 4.7 inches which
one is for you if you have extremely
small hands then you might be stuck with
something like an iPhone 5s or something
like one Mini or something like an s4
mini if you are able to handle the
bigger phone it's hard to not recommend
it especially if you're just buying an
unlocked phone because the hardware
you're getting the capability you're
getting is much broader and much better
I wish and I mean Samsung is just as
guilty of this as anyone else I wish
that these mid-range phones weren't so
cut-down in fact I was a little bit
frustrated with the Samsung Repp telling
me that the s4 mini was basically just
an s4 but smaller cuz it's not it
actually runs similar hardware to what
you find in the one mini and it has that
same s4 plastic build to the point where
I'd say it's probably worth the extra
few bucks to go with something like this
so at the end of all this do I have a
conclusion and recommendation not really
I hope that this gave you some idea of
what my thoughts are on the one mini but
it's not as simple as go buy or don't go
buy because it's a very personal choice
when going with something like this but
at the end of the day I'm not going to
switch to it I tried it out and I'd
rather suffer with not being able to use
it one-handed all the time and go with
the HTC one moving forward like this
video if you liked it
like it if you disliked it leave a
comment and let us know what you thought
about it if you had feelings that were
more complex than that we don't do much
mobile phone stuff so giving us your
feedback doesn't allow us to improve it
