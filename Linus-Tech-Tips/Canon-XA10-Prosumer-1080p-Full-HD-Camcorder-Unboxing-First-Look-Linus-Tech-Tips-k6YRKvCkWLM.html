unboxing I've done in a while this is
the Canon x8n HD camcorder so we are
finally upgrading our ancient Sony HD
camcorder that we use for shooting NCIX
tech tips this is an SD SDHC SDXC
camcorder so what it means is we're
recording completely on to solid state
media which is pretty nice
both for speed and for convenience all
right all right what do we got here so
this is probably okay warranty
registration card anyway transfer
utility so yeah we're finally replacing
the NCIX tech tips camera and so so this
is a much higher quality much higher
caliber of camera than what we've used
in the past okay we got a transfer
utility here we got camcorder music data
image mix data disc okay
sure why not register your camcorder now
and receive exclusive benefits from
Canon okay I can in professional
services transfer utility installation
guide whoo-hoo instruction manual so
this is like thick this is a big old
instruction manual one third of it is
English so shows you how to change
toilet you know what let me see if I can
find something with the general specs of
the unit so that I have something to
refer to because I haven't really looked
at any information about it since i
pre-ordered it which was like two months
ago it's taken a really long time to
come in stock okay so here's the
highlights of the x8n but I'm gonna put
that aside for myself to refer back to
and let's start finding some accessories
and whatnot here okay oh my goodness I
don't even know where to begin with this
okay this looks like a battery pack
we're just gonna like open stuff up
because we're gonna be using this camera
today hopefully yeah intelligence
lithium-ion battery you see that okay
okay all right what do we got next next
we have
remote wireless controller okay next we
have some screws okay those are mounting
screws for something in all likelihood
another little battery okay some kind of
little clip I better not lose any of
this stuff looks like there's some
assembly required here folks here's the
lens cover thing put down the end of the
camera excellent okay we got here
power brick and this garbage is gonna
start blowing away if I don't find
something to do with it
so here you can look at the power brick
while I figure out what to do with my
okay okay we're good so the power brick
power cord nothing really exciting there
okay now we're getting into some cables
so our first cable is a component out
cable that uses a little interface on
the camera outputs component for
monitoring what you're doing alright
next we got so this is where our looks
like our mics plug into so we have two
channels there little buttons to eject
them we've been using like a
consumer-level camera up till now I'll
look at all this so we can like change
it good stuff cameraman probably knows a
lot better than me what all of this does
because I'm kind of a camera idiot but
that's a zoom right that's azumed yeah
he's giving me the indication that that
is indeed zoom some kind of lock
start/stop oh okay no it's not locked
it's sweet so here's a shoe for a little
flash
whatever it is it looks good love it
okay next we have this some other kind
of more different bracket
it's got like soft rubber on it here and
here hold something okay cameras are not
my strong point guys you wanted to see a
professional camera and boxing go
somewhere else this is just me unboxing
my new toy
okay USB two for transferring files and
finally composite output from the camera
itself so that's just your single video
and then stereo audio so now I have the
x8n camera which is safely packaged
inside bubble wrap it's actually really
small I was expecting it to be a little
bit bigger so here why don't I just read
off the packaging what some of the key
features are and at him
highlights of the x8n HD recording with
a digit DV 3 processor cool ok 1/3 inch
see most sensors at cashiers video and
effective pixels out of approx 2.07
megapixels which is 1080p ok widezoom
lens with a focal length at full and
wide angle of 30 point 4 you know I'm
just gonna hold this out here in
cameraman can look at it because he
knows what's interesting and I don't
emphasis on versatility manual controls
at your fingertips face detection
infrared recording you in the dark so we
can do like night tech tips really
recording and double slot recording so
when your SD card is full you can just
final taneous ly 2 to memory cards it
doesn't make me any way to backup your
recordings interesting or you can record
to one than the other and just swap
memory cards as you go so that you can
record without interruption other
features audio you can use the built-in
microphone mic audio input terminal or
the two XLR audio input terminals when
recording LCD screen and viewfinder I
don't have a look at that
hundred percent frame coverage which is
sure that you can accurately check that
your shots are framed how you want them
so let's just go ahead and open that up
nice big wide screen you know what let's
see if the battery pack has any charge
on it sometimes they do you know okay
let's figure out where the button is to
do the thing okay hold on maybe I can
mount this too so AHA so this goes on
here so that's pretty straight for it oh
no no it slides in here first so you
slide in like lift this up flip these up
slide it in like that once you have them
lift it up sufficiently there we go put
that back in there I'm sure it's making
good contact screw these bad boys in
okay there so yeah I don't even know
what that thing is up there so we
assembled it a little bit now we did not
put the microphone holder on since I do
use a lapel mic that mounts right here
so yeah we won't be using that at all
we'll just be using our little wireless
unit and then let's say it's not charged
at all so I can't really show you guys
any of that powered image stabilization
got our touch screen here that little
piece that I couldn't figure out what it
was that's a stylus so we won't be using
that in all likelihood okay here we can
switch between playback and recording
mode here's where the SD cards go pretty
sweet yeah infrared on and off it's very
ergonomic I'll tell you guys that much
like that the feel of it is very nice so
I can very easily reach the zoom
controls up here slides very smoothly so
that'll be good for nice smooth zoom
shots from camera man here's the
viewfinder if we're not using an
external display which we in all
likelihood will be using
this is something no idea okay start
stop here we can change between a few
different modes manual Auto and cinema
whoo I think this is focus right now
focus yeah cameraman says that's focus
so we have manual focus now high
technology for NCIX tech tips and I
think that's pretty much it so oh okay
okay okay we have to do one more shot
here we have to do one more shot okay
here give me give me this give me this
okay
cameraman has to hold the camera and
then I'm gonna show you guys a glimpse
of the cameraman this is what it looks
like when he's holding a camera thanks
