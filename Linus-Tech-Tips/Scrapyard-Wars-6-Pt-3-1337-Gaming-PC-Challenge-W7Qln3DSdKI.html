the new D brand grip learn more at the
link below we got the guy Ken's gonna
bring us the hard drive he owes us yeah
in like 15 minutes yeah
so we have two hard drives we have like
five buyers lined up for the hard drives
which is funny there's a guy right now
that might buy both of the hard drives
for 25 bucks each
and the other guys I only mentioned 15
apiece so that's potentially like 20
more dollars right so that's 50 bucks
right there if you buy books cuz I did
25 for a two terabyte so did you huh
gareki i missed obviously very fair i
mean he should go to free geek and get
them for a $5 cheaper each but he
doesn't know that so that's fair yeah
yeah a minimum we're gonna have seven
7:42 possibly a seven 750 - whoo
yeah this is Jason okay uh well done
come down Thanks
so the day started off slow because we
have our GPUs but then we needed the
rest of the hardware so it was basically
spent on researching our options in the
morning it might not have really looked
like we were doing anything but it was
really stressful
there was one deal in particular a
really good quad-core bundle for a
hundred and fifty bucks that agreed 16
hours prior but then didn't hear from me
for 16 hours so I followed up
immediately and then it was just like
playing the waiting game
finally after waiting around all morning
for that core i5 bundle and exhausting
all of our options to try to upgrade it
to a cry 7 we had a total breakthrough
hold on in the day look at this thing
960 which is exactly what we've been
looking at 750 holy crap this is what we
need it even includes the SSD and it's
fight for its they don't oh my god this
was posted 25 days ago it's probably
solo that's gone no no there's a phone
number most boards in that generation
especially the ones that had all six
yeah
okay slots popular that had all six
slots and then deep support SLI okay but
I don't know which one this is it
doesn't look like there's enough spacing
underneath that CPU hi I'm calling about
chair gaming computer on Craigslist oh
yeah hi is that still for sale yes
are you are you able to knock off a
little bit if we don't need the graphics
card are you thinking like 50 bucks yeah
definitely
that could work can you do any earlier
okay can I ask one more question your
your motherboard is it SLI compatible
SLI yes okay ISO 350 meet at 4 o'clock
okay try to resell it or or something
sure I do you mind texting me your
address that way I can I can be there
ready to go cuz I gotta take transit I
don't have a car okay
for at 4 o'clock okay and if you're a
little late that's cool please text
rescue text us the address now though so
we can we can make sure we're there
thank you how did we just flip from we
have nothing and he's gonna throw in the
GPU for us which we can use maybe we
should start trying to flip it yeah
let's let's flip it now just would you
get 'spicy X 580 like it's actually
worth something
muga I think why is it
yeah yeah must be ok can we do a screen
shot okay wait we can just find the
stock footage of the card oh my god I
think it includes a monitor no okay what
yeah what if we don't get the monitor
and lower the price anymore when you
need it I don't know I don't want to
lowball oh I think we should try and
sell the morning we're like really cheap
yeah that way bucks
yeah yeah let's get our Craigslist Eamon
I mean we're not gonna pee I'm excited
Cooper you getting responses for the
1980s bi so went from nothing to
something
I think it would've been cool if we
could get to 92t eyes wait what's that
Brandon I think they have two ninnies
yes that might be a problem we spent a
lot of time this morning just doing
research trying to find parts so I was
legitimately concerned about the morning
felt like we were getting nothing done
eight hundred dollars that's 537 you
know getting to fairly cheap Oh power
supplies and an SSD like a hundred and
fifty hundred eighty dollars you'd
slaughter everything with a 1080 ice and
then probably win that's scary I mean we
don't even know that they have it we can
come and they can be trying to get that
I'm pretty sure they've got isn't a
gaming test right it's all about GPU
yeah look if we can't sell this stuff we
didn't actually get that computer for a
very good price yeah so we need to try
to sell this stuff that we need to try
to bargain other people cuz right now I
think we're behind they keep looking
only because it's beating today in
nineteen eighty is a lion marginally I
can't find any I have found one 1080i
that's for sale in all of BC so far hmm
I'm down to keep looking like 100% but
okay so let's throw it on the
spreadsheet though so what what we pay
350 that includes cooler motherboard RAM
power supply case SSD what CPU is this
this is the 960 the one that we
originally knew what we wanted
okay so we have a hundred and fifty
bucks to play with and we could walk
there
we need the spreadsheet for all the crap
we have to sell GTX 580 1080p which is
monitor let's I can get begin on the we
have a wireless end card okay here's a
crazy thought go back to Xeon 6-core guy
right offered us just the CPU and we can
try and just buy a six core CPU for a
hundred and fifty bucks for what for a
month for our motherboard as long as it
supports it you know what we're gonna
have to try and do we got to try and
identify that board let's go guys we got
to do some CSI here man enhance you know
so the SATA port so did we just knock
the price down fifty but he's still
gonna glue the graphics right for us yes
that is exactly what just went down okay
so there's two PCIe 1x slots right at
the top and there's a heat sink right
there because the SATA ports are right
next to each other okay right right
right okay
so it's not that it could be no it
wouldn't be durable no it's not this
because it doesn't have orange yeah
is there no orange so it could be this
one or it could be this one let's see if
we can figure out what Southbridge
heatsink
I don't think it has the big night yeah
so it's so it could be this one mm-hmm
here let's have a look let's look at
this one big and let's see if that looks
likely okay that's facing looks right
see it has that little piece I think
that's yeah I think it's a fan header
yeah fan header and then two of these
vases two three four five six does it
have the ultra durable on the
motherboard can you see I don't know if
we can see it cuz they look cool in how
about we can we brighten it up in
Photoshop
liquid you know expose the image so we
can see more detail maybe but you know
what I think I think we know what it is
now I think it's this one I think it's
this one because see this heatsink here
that looks right what about these
connectors here let's have a look
ah which was it I think about thoughts
yeah
you know I think that's this so it's so
I think it's uh ud3 or Oh does that
support us ally guys do you guys buy
components I've got some USB 3 expansion
cards I've got a NVIDIA GTX 660 and an a
soos often the drive on me okay okay
thanks that MDOT to you misty sorry Jay
they're all gone but I wished he could
fortunately that big boys to come and I
sent that from an email today have you
seen from it so what happened was now
sending emails from my phone I have my
burner email but the signature from my
main email was being applied to all of
those accounts and I didn't realize it
his burner email had like cheese two
cents than a link to his YouTube channel
and stuff on the bottom a little bit
annoying so this guy responded back when
I asked hey I'm interested in the 10 1/2
cash can meet in Vancouver and the
SkyTrain would you consider 625 cash
what is your availability he responded
back was like I can't believe a person I
watch on YouTube almost every day
contacted me I glad you have it for 640
and I can meet any day between 3:00 p.m.
and 9 p.m. at any Canada Line station in
Richmond or Vancouver so he didn't give
it to me for the price I was asking for
but can we still buy it if we give the
offer if the original price requested on
the ad if we don't find another one the
original price requested on the ad was
650 so he only dropped at 10 bucks he
did not he didn't give me the price I
was offering that was I was requesting
what were you asking for 600 he's asking
650 I said can he give his to me for 625
he's like oh my god it's Jay but no I
could do 640 so there's no leverage in
Who I am there but he did acknowledge I
am Who I am so my question is now if
this has becomes our only option like
this is the only reply we've got we
could call edy but I think we've listed
Craigslist price it's still fair that's
what I think cuz that's no haggle
hold on oh oh I'm I'm gonna be so upset
right now
he said that supports SLI he said it did
but he's a guy on Craigslist that's a
lie okay okay
in terms of spacing you know what we
could do is we could run it here and
here if we wanted to use our high
bandwidth bridge or if he's got the SLI
beam he's got the box for this yeah we
could just run it here and here which
would have been how its intended to be
run so we got to decide do we want a
higher bandwidth SLI connection or do we
want a higher bandwidth PCIe PCIe we can
try both yeah we're gonna have time
we're gonna have an extra monitor you
know what's up what's up now okay I have
one quick housekeeping item to deal with
first remember the reason we were
looking up that board was we wanted to
know if it supported ECC Ram why are we
going with the ECC Ram because I don't
think that guy's gonna part out his six
core if we don't at least also take if
we know with his Elan yeah instead of
the 960 would it make a difference
yeah because the 960 is a quad core but
maybe it's clock time you might be right
I don't think so though like it's a this
is like this is a ball and Xeon it's a
see if I can find it here it's a W 3670
I think it's like basically top of the
line
so we're thinking we found the best
price for an SSD that we can find is
actually on Amazon when you just get
free one day shipping anyways
I love watching his face because as
we're saying this he's like running
through his head what he knows the other
team is doing is like how quickly he
just like but we were trying forgot
where it gets delivered to him because
it's a delivery till as late as nine
o'clock so I mean that's the kind of
package that would get left outside but
and I would feel that the walk we would
have to make sure we get here before
Linus because I could see him screwed it
would be in a package I don't care you
wouldn't steal I wouldn't steal it but I
see my hiding it just to screw with us
so jealous here's what I told the other
guy I said damn I didn't realize my
signature showed up that means I cannot
accept your price of 640 or continued
the deal right now and the best I can do
is hope that I don't find another 1084
cheaper and offer you the original price
at 6:50 which is love the other rules
yeah
good is secretly written emails and
totally cheated in a way of like dude
yeah just sell to me for like 500 but
then I'll just give you the card back at
the end of the day I'd do it to you
whatever it takes to beat lanes 760 -
everything's accounted for here do you
want to close the door um Luke oh thank
you yeah thank you
here we go that's it I just don't know
my buddy's password it's hooked up to
the laundry right here it's going into
this computer that's we're taking the
drys from do you think that guy look
just pride in here is well maybe a decoy
you're very expensive decoy yeah even if
you're paying your decoy you like ten
bucks an hour that still we'll see how
long it takes without glad to come down
because if he's there for like a couple
of hours it's heavy it doesn't make any
sense yeah if he's there to like maybe
troubleshoot something yeah like if he's
there just to like demonstrate that
something works
that's probably if he didn't have
anything to carry with me I saw I'm the
one whoa you know I think you didn't
have shoes on don't socks either okay
I'm just saying the word like we have
three hours no we have two hours until
we leave to pick up our meal walk there
yeah what are we going to do in that
hour of walking there I don't know
there's nothing left to do this is the
most done that I've been at like
lunchtime on the second day and I can't
even sit at lunch
I see I think I know it's not
interesting
okay she goes she came in empty she left
with a ball and and if you didn't even
need to know that a rough with the box
there we could hear him saying I'll let
you know if there's any issues with
anything they're selling hard work
are you on Craigslist right now are you
trying to find their hands I went up to
processed and type in computer parts for
anything that was posted today to see if
they maybe if we can recognize like
their hand in the photo or something I
doubt they'd be that's - oh they're
pretty stupid
um okay maybe they'd be that stupid this
is posted at this exact address
interesting okay but honestly I think
this tells us a lot about what they've
got because if I were them so what we
know is that they got rid of a drop and
they're trying to get rid of a video
card okay so the video card is a gtx 660
so what that tells us is that whatever
base system they have is from around
that era probably right because who
would put a 660 in like a seventy seven
hundred cases Tiffany wouldn't do that
mm-hmm so unless this is something
they're trying to do to mess with our
heads but like I'm pretty good so so
they just got 15 bucks selling hardware
do you think this was in there just so I
bet this is it look either that or they
still have more
dear Lord what can we reply and see
their number that's him that's Luke his
phone number
that's his freak why would he put his
phone number with an idiot okay okay so
this is good if they don't know that
we're on to them then yeah okay okay so
technically max is with us but you know
it's just such a gorgeous day for
vlogging it's so beautiful yeah we
haven't done any vlogging on day two yet
so basically we got a hike but two miles
that way and luckily we're on the same
path all the way until we have to turn
the right and I would have fall can't
get lost we got the beautiful leaves
we've got the beautiful yeah look at
this look at this the leaves are
changing color it's a gorgeous day a
gorgeous day to mess with somebody um
this is actually a very popular brand
which bus stop do you want to meet at we
are off Brandel I also have to take the
bus so we need to work out a location
terrible horrible impression of Luke but
this is great he or he he said they also
have picked a bus wide this deep does he
think that no because he's I think he's
he knows it's us uh I think he's playing
the game and though it's a double play
it's all in the it's all the brain games
today okay so I'm gonna get back to you
right away like now that now that we're
engaged and we're replying I'm not gonna
worry too much about seeming too eager
but you know what we should do let's
find us a phone so we can do the prank
call about their part
sorry can I ask you a stupid question my
dumb friend posted something on
Craigslist and I want to mess with him
but he'll recognize my number if I give
you my phone to hold can I borrow yours
to call him I'll take like two minutes
oh it's worth a shot
also she wanted to stop and pet your dog
anyway so that that's where we're at
with that yeah she would have let us use
her phone to jump at it
you do like a higher-pitched okay ah um
if I do a higher pitch that I might kind
of sound like I like a kid well maybe it
just doesn't sound very good at all no
I'll tell it to you okay this tells me
oh so two betrayed oh where do you want
to set the trap throat
uh yeah that would be no problem we
could totally come downtown okay clean
um I can be you right now
it's 5150 what yeah yeah sorry we've got
a lot of demands to the prices no no you
don't buy this at all do you if you were
actually trying to get me to buy that
that was a very poor attempt I thought
you were just trying to make a joke by
150 Eggman the plan though was for him
to believe the emails and not to buy the
phone call yes so email is the real
thing everything is going according to
the plan
she totally buys this perfect we're on
15th Street only one block over it's
definitely them yeah what time would you
be there so I'm just gonna say I got a
grab a bite to eat and all I'll text you
when I'm on my way this is the bus stop
he wants to meet at oh we are here were
there when he gets off work i disgust
him when it is originally he's was
thinking like four so his plans bailed
it might be soon you want to pitch him
some PCI and then some two T's I'll give
you these should be around 5:45 might be
a little bit later depends on the food's
ready
what we're eating home
oh my say uh at least the guy with the
1080 is on time
all right there we go that's 550 on one
more
I'm fixity
you got a 50 right here that's that's
good right no he's at 550 it's 650 1 2 3
4 5 300 1 2 3 4 5 400 1 2 3 4 5 500 and
so it's six hundred twenty forty sixty
we need to break a 20 save a ten
okay Brandon can can break that fights
wheel Brandon ten right do you have two
tens
okay and then we just give him a 20th
out of that
that's yours can we change with that
okay count it again sorry take all that
okay great right so all right thanks
thanks thank you
hope it wins thank you
okay you don't put this in your bag will
it fit yeah I don't know if it'll fit
but you need at the box can you do we
got one hour to spare
hey Demetri to jump in the MacBook no
did we completely forget to bring a
computer okay so no entertainment
we just got each other well oh good
forgot each other and your incessant
demands for water
there was no water again so thank you
Linus for that oh hey you said to her
thirsty right yeah look I've got this
dry ass bread you made us buy you want
some
I think I will keep it from now on so
when you're hungry tomorrow hade weed
you get have some bread give some bread
three tree no I ate it with my gallon of
water I'm gonna soak this in the water
and eat it in front of you but we we got
this idea of getting free water from the
subway by asking politely that guy had
water I think he's coming from the
subway and it's free I'm gonna try and
get some me some water
from Subway I think it's free like if
you buy something I can ask
I can still ask I don't got no cash to
pay okay can I have some yeah
Wow dang wow what a day hello great how
are you is it possible to get a just a
glass of water
hey Linus no not only did you succeed
you actually didn't get me one I think
it's wonderful it's one per person wow I
never thought I'd say this but I wish I
had J on my team instead of you oh I
wish I'd gotten Jane a football you know
we can share this okay thank you
do you wish you had J now I got
sparkling water sparkling water cuz we
fancy man we fancy people this is where
we get the bulk of our stuff or like our
dreams are dashed yeah okay so here's
how it went down the system is not
actually booting right now
something about a DMI loading DMI
something but we got into the BIOS you
could see that the hardware was working
we could see the RAM we could see the
CPU
although the CPUs running at 89 degrees
right now yeah so we got to do something
about the thermal compound application
on there make well maybe have to find a
different cooler for our budget we still
have a little bit money we especially
have a little bit of money because he
actually not $20 off because the power
adapter for our monitor which will have
to sell wait do you have the adapter
okay doesn't have a cable for it so we
actually only paid 330 for our setup
here but quick googling suggests that
the error we're getting when we try to
boot could be to do with a bad drive he
says he knows the drive is good cuz he
loaded Windows 10 on it on another
machine but it could be an
incompatibility I don't know so right
now I'm pretty nervous but I'm also
pretty hopeful the good news is we saved
20 bucks cuz he didn't have a power
cable we didn't need which means that we
could transit back now let's transit
back I would unless we need a new SSD
then we could save that $20 to buy an
SSD we could buy an SSD for 60 bucks
which we have in the budget did we ever
get a call back he's willing to pay for
its 120 gigabyte for 60 bucks if this
doesn't work
so you want to bus back the thing is
it's five o'clock is it really so we
have to bus back otherwise we'll hear it
from the other team again you know okay
all right yeah let's pass back okay
seventeen no no that one
shoo I think we're gonna just hold
seventeen seventeen okay we got that I
can't find our transfers though although
wait
there is no fifteen here it was the
seventeen you're talking about Willis oh
dang it we've just missed it again
meanwhile the other team waits for their
mystery six60 buyer to show up little do
they know they're getting totally played
wait what oh he's not buying the card
he's a fan ah
but we wasted some time trying to go
meet a dude he ended up not showing up
and not kind of burned our our that we
didn't really end up using that was
extra time from last being late the
other day so we didn't really end up
absolutely utilizing that time and we
didn't get to sell the card which sucked
I have suspicions that that was Linus I
mean it's being a dick hole but like
it's not against the rules
it's probably not them I'm just freaking
out because he's late this is the first
time that like during the competition hi
nice to meet you Thank You Kurt
yes you bet and if there's any issues I
live right down the street so we're
practically neighbors just text me and
you can have your money back too oh
you're busy
yes it's been a full day of Craig's
listing take care so in total we have
dual GTX 980 t is from EVGA we're really
good cards we have a gigabyte x58
motherboard my core i7 966 gigabytes of
ddr3 RAM and a to 40 gigabytes Samsung
840 or 256 and a 750 watt power supply
that will power all our needs we are
trying to sell the six gigabytes of RAM
and we're trying to sell the monitor
that came with the PC and then hopefully
once we get the Xeon processor we can
also flip that until 960 quickly for
like 20 bucks so we can have leased some
water money we're probably going 18
times too deep on this
they were so mad like I'm legitimately
glad we didn't pop out of the bushes and
they're gonna have two months to cool
down and Jay will be in a different
country when they find out that that was
us I forgot my wallet I can't make it
this is really embarrassing or something
like that
something kind of genuine sounding crap
I'm sorry I forgot my wallet I can't
make it this is so embarrassing
I'm pissed
oh my god no no no they have no idea
what three minutes ago that's fine want
to meet up tomorrow can you give me a
call to iron it out we now have two
hundred and eleven dollars and 87 cents
total wait
yeah in total okay so if I put in a six
score plus Ram okay that leaves us with
54 17 so we have six gigs of ddr3 no but
if we sell the monitor monitor yeah what
else do we have anything else and we
have a 960 CPU right so we go get the
CPU in RAM regardless so we have the
whole day tomorrow to get the Zeon's and
then figure out how to make the
motherboard work if it doesn't we buy
that a snooze board yeah and but we have
to sell the monitor okay and the and the
extra RAM for $45 total at this point I
would be very not surprised if it was
Linus you know we have 55 minutes of
that hour left
so we know it works the host guys we're
so mad
coming back from waiting at the bus stop
and just really hope that we wake up
with some one wind divided six sixty
that's not all this so right now we have
a core i7 966 gigs of RAM a gigabyte SLI
compatible motherboard a TX 750 750 watt
power supply a corsair 600 case and we
have two gtx 980ti s we have a smokin
system so the plan for tomorrow is to
Trek all the way out to Coquitlam an
hour and a half each way plus it'll
probably cost us about sixteen dollars
in transit to get a six core processor
and double the amount of memory it's
still 615 we still have some craigslist
time and i heard back from the guy with
the asus p16 uh-huh he'll do it for $100
in case our motherboards done in case
our motherboards dead do we have enough
money still for the seals let's find out
I actually don't know oh crap no we have
a hundred and seventy-one dollars left
so so if our board is dead we have to go
get the six core yeah that means we have
to troubleshoot this board in like a few
minutes tomorrow morning and determine
work if we're buying a new board or
there's Neil or if we're buying the six
cord personally when I look at the
hardware that we have it doesn't seem
super aggressive we ended up spending a
