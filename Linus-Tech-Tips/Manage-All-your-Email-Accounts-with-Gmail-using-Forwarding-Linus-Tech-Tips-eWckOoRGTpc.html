video about this how to use one email
sign in to manage multiple email
accounts so slick put together a little
tutorial it's actually not as hard as
you might think so we're going to be
using Gmail for our example but these
steps should be pretty similar in other
email accounts although pretty much the
reason we're using gmail to manage all
the email accounts is because it's
pretty much what you should be doing so
you go into settings then you go to
accounts and import so see I would have
gone to something like forward and pop /
I'm at but that's actually if you want
to go the other way around so we're
going to be using accounts and import
we're going to add another email address
you own so in this case we want the name
for anything that we send from that
other email address to be stilled like
PC so that's fine and the email address
is going to be slick PC test at hot
matey's can tell we've done this before
at hotmail com these two don't really
matter because you can edit this one
later and that is pretty much it so next
step send through gmail so this is
easier to setup it doesn't make that
much of a difference so yeah we're just
going to do it that way before you can
send mail all you have to do is verify
that you actually own that other email
address which is sort of important so we
send a verification over there an email
has been sent with a confirmation code
then we check over here gmail
confirmation send mail as blah blah blah
here's your confirmation code enter that
into the other window which I have lost
there we go verify and that's not quite
it so okay here we can change these
options again so all that's fine so we
can go back to our inbox but you
actually have to set up the other email
account to forward as well so you just
go into more mail settings email
forwarding and forward your mail to
another email accounts so slick PC test
at gmail com and then you can tell it if
you want to keep a copy of the forwarded
messages in your outlook inbox I
probably would doesn't seem like a bad
idea okay the next thing we have to do
is go into internet explorer where we
had set up a test email sending too
slick pc test at hotmail com and i'm in
excellent so we're going to send that
and go back to Firefox where we can see
in our gmail inbox we have no new mail
we have no new mail we have new mail
there we go now what we do is we send
back sort of blah blah blah blah and we
can change who we're sending it from so
we can either send it from hotmail which
is the default because this was sent to
the hotmail account or we can actually
send it from the gmail account that
we're using so we're going to send it
from hotmail back to this gmail account
blah blah blah blah and you can see that
when you click down here it is coming
from the hotmail com account so that's
that's it it's that simple pretty cool
huh let's see if it's uh didn't save in
sent but it does keep the it does keep
the original one in here I hope this was
helpful and guys something to be aware
of is forwarding the emails and sending
emails from that account does not
necessarily qualify as signing in so if
your email provider has terms such as
you know make sure you sign in once
every year or once every two hundred and
seventy days or whatever it happens to
be you actually have to sign in once in
a while so I would set up a calendar
reminder for yourself or something
thanks for checking out this episode of
linus tech tips and we'll see you guys
later for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
