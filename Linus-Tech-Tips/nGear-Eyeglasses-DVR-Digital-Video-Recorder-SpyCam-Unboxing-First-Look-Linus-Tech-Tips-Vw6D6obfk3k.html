unboxing a product that is an eyeglass
DVR life full of its brilliant moments
with this eyeglasses DVR on you will
never let any memorable scenes sneak
away from your life okay excellent so
then there's a chick she's driving in
her car and I'm pretty sure that the
glasses are photoshopped onto her but
that's not really the point okay let's
get to the highlighted specs so real
time video and audio recording never let
member Bluff okay something something
user friendly operation for easy control
the extended slot for a micro SD card
okay two gig micro card for as long as
50 minutes of video and audio recording
so it does record audio as well as video
you've got an easy connection with USB
to your PC or laptop quality Polaroid
lens from brand maker I'm not sure if
they're referring to the camera lens or
the actual glasses lens they're saying
this is necessary equipment for device
recommended highly for police's
journalists travelers and etc elegant
design suitable for both men and women
users ok the smallest camera for hidden
micro switch controls for easy operation
alright let's get this baby open and see
just how stylish it is so accessories
first of all we've got a USB cable you
can see it uses a standard 8a mini B so
that's really nice to see it'll be easy
to get a replacement cable it also
includes an adapter for your wall just
converts AC power to USB 5 volt
that's very nice as well it does include
a driver disk this is probably for like
Windows 98 because anything else
anything newer than that should have
support for it right out of the box the
whole box just fell apart as soon as I
opened it that's okay though it comes in
a nice little hard case so that's
actually quite durable feeling that's
pretty that's pretty nice the zipper
seems like it's reasonable quality it's
not gonna get caught
alright so let's get the eyeglasses DVR
out of the box
and check this out so these are the
stylish eyeglasses DVR so let's start at
the sides I guess okay so first of all
on this side there's no connectivity
here there's like kind of a a
great-looking thing I don't think that's
an actual part of the microphone device
okay
so then around to the front now you can
see that the the glasses themselves are
not really very see-through right now
but the reason for that is there's a
protective blue blue plastic covering I
can actually even get that off I'll be
able to show you exactly how to remove
it okay yeah so you can see there's like
a plastic covering that comes off it so
we'll just leave that on for now okay
here at the front that is where the
camera is so it's a little tiny lens can
you even see in there really can you
kind of see yeah it's really hard to see
because it's camouflaged with all these
out there random holes in the front of
the glasses so they're being tricky okay
so then on this side this is where the
micro switch controls are okay so I'm
guessing one of these is like on/off and
it doesn't come with any instructions so
maybe that's what's on here maybe that's
the instruction CD okay and then at the
bottom you can see there's a micro SD
slot as well as a USB port so what it
comes down to really is oh oh here we go
yeah so this is power and then this is
to this is to do something record I
guess okay and so like they say here it
is hmm elegant design suitable for both
men and women users so let's find out
just how elegant the design is okay so
feel free to leave comments under the
YouTube video about just how elegant the
design is let's get this from both sides
here and thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the eyeglasses DVR video
recorder device I'm gonna record the
cameraman - that guy thinks he's so
smart recording me yeah yeah joke's on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
