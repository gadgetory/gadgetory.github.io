in a while and not because there hasn't
been any handy technology in the last
little bit because we've been so
incredibly busy with other projects so I
guess it was a bit of a blessing in
disguise that I came into the office
this morning having forgotten the
microphone I was supposed to review
today at home because now we get handy
tech that SL 600 microphone review will
be coming soon by the way so we'll find
out if a dedicated single condenser
module cardioid mic can dethrone the
jack-of-all-trades Yeti Pro but first
this video
of course there's a che di GT and h100 I
GTX all-in-one liquid coolers improve
both the appearance and cooling of your
PC click my face to learn more as long
as Nik doesn't forget
now our first handy tech under a hundred
today is one that I actually dug my
heels in about buying Brandon really
wanted one though so basically I finally
said okay look fine
if I never have to use it and I don't
have to see you wasting time thinking
around with it because there's a
thousand other useful things you could
be doing you can get one it's a label
maker specifically the brother Pete uh
CH D 200 so to give some background
Brandon is a bit of an obsessive about
putting labels on things and while I see
the benefit for things that belong to
him and he brings to the office he can
label those at home and it seems like a
waste of time to run around the office
labeling things that belong to the
company since you can pretty much assume
anything
unlabeled belongs to line.this Media
Group and besides for my point of view
printers or printers they never work
their upkeep is expensive and they
almost always end up wasting more time
than they save since a piece of tape and
a pen is just as functional to me as a
label maker at least that's what I
thought a standalone single purpose
label maker like this that requires no
wireless connection no computer and just
generally takes a text input on its
built-in keyboard and spits out a label
within a few seconds is actually a
godsend for everything from organizing
which SD cards are for which cameras and
which power adapters go with which
laptops or network switches to well
that's actually the only thing I use it
for but it's definitely worth the 35
bucks for that alone it's not perfect
the side margins are too big so it
wastes some paper
the replacement cartridges cost a third
as much as the entire device and the
menu system isn't exactly revolutionary
and awesome but I am officially
converted I thought it was useless when
I bought it but it truly is a handy
piece of tech my second handy tech item
today is well let's start with this
every day I get companies sending me
their latest Stu
Bluetooth doodad that for some reason
they think makes my life easier but it's
actually just another confounded gadget
to remember to charge from my
perspective but this one is actually
surprisingly cool it's called the
gatekeeper and it has the same
functionality as those Bluetooth
proximity tags where there's an iOS or
Android phone app that lets you know if
your luggage or your purse or whatever
this is attached to moves too far away
with an audible alarm but that's not
that cool and I said this thing was cool
the cool part is that it comes with a
USB lock dongle that allows you to
automatically lock or unlock your
Windows or Mac based PC simply by moving
near it or away from it the app is super
simple to install on your computer and
set up you just pair the lock and key by
putting them next to each other set up a
proximity threshold I found somewhere in
the middle was good for having the lock
plugged into my keyboard although if you
had it inside your case with one of
those little dongles that we actually
introduced in the last handy tech then
you might want to set it a little bit
further away then all you do is move
away from the PC and it locks in toward
it and boom it unlocks by the time
you've put your butt in your chair
usually now to be clear Windows
passwords are pretty easy to defeat on
their own so if you're just using a
gatekeeper on its own then it's not much
of a deterrent for someone who has
unlimited time to access your computer
and is trying really hard to steal your
data but what it does do is prevent
casual eavesdropping from coworkers or
or other patients in a setting like a
doctor's office or hospital and much
much more and if that's not enough for
you you can actually set your system up
to require both the keychain key and a
typed password for unlocking so
two-factor authentication and then if
you combine the gatekeeper with other
security measures like BitLocker full
drive encryption it can actually be
fairly difficult to defeat it with you
know a couple passwords and the physical
item in the way of all but the most
dastardly data thieves my last handy
tech item is one that many of you will
already actually already own and the
vast majority of you will already know
about at the very least
but it's the kind of thing where it
might take a video like this to make you
think oh snap I gotta go order a couple
of those so next time I'm running all
over the place looking for one when I
have a Skype meeting in five minutes
that I'm supposed to join I'll know
where it is now pretty much everyone
knows that the vast majority of personal
audio devices use a female
three-and-a-half millimeter or eighth
inch jack but what some people don't
know is that in addition to their
actually being some wiring variations
they can actually have three or four
contact points depending on whether
they're designed to accommodate a pair
of headphones or speakers a microphone
or both of those things yes the
popularity of smartphones and ultrabooks
with no physical space for two separate
Jack's has skyrocketed the popularity of
four pole three and a half millimeter
Jack's but if you happen to have a
headset for Skype or gaming or whatever
else it is that doesn't have four poles
you can plug it in and just use it as a
headphone or you can get one of these
little puppies to split the audio output
and input for you now there's not a
whole lot to say about these other than
that I ordered a couple from Amazon a
star tech one for a few bucks and a
Sennheiser one for a few bucks more and
they both work about as expected the
Sennheiser one has more supple thinner
wires and features gold plating on the
connectors inside and out a longevity
booster but given that I could afford
literally twice as many of the cheaper
ones I think I lean towards those or if
there's something on monoprice that for
whatever reason I couldn't find and is
cheaper then that's good too
since functionally they are exactly the
same but like super handy and that's
what this video series is about
speaking of functionally exactly the
same most portable battery banks except
this one from cheero power the world's
first battery for ingress agents
officially licensed by neon tech Niantic
whatever Niantic labs i'll start-up
within google dedicated to creating
mobile apps that connect people with the
real world like ingress so ingress if
you're not familiar with it it's kind of
this unique entertainment experience
known as
real-world game and all new style of
game featuring innovative massively
multiplayer mobile gameplay which
transforms neighborhoods and cities
around the world into the welded
interactive gaming experience there's
like 9 million downloads there's a huge
community around it and this battery
bank is for ingress agents okay so it
okay so it's not that functionally
different from other battery banks it
features an ultra high-capacity battery
so that's 12,000 milliamp hours it's
compatible with regular one amp charging
devices it's got a one amp port for
those and it's got a quick charging 2.1
amp port allowing an iphone for example
to be charged up to five times on a
single charge and quickly something
that's definitely handy when you're out
and about with your phone constantly
powered on and in front of you speaking
of powered on it in front of you it
comes with a nice supple USB cable so
you go ahead and pop that baby in your
back pocket you got your phone in your
other hand and you can go around and do
your ingress things now where it does
get difference is that it does have a
variety of lighting pattern so you press
the power button press the power button
oops that's not the power button not so
you press the power button and the
lights light up you can short press the
LED control button and change the color
of the center logo you can long press
and these other LEDs around it are gonna
light up and looks pretty cool and I
guess that's pretty much all there is to
say about it it's outfitted with the
usual automatic shutdown protection and
automatic overcharge prevention and
short-circuit protection all that good
stuff and I think that pretty much wraps
that puppy up you can check out the link
in the video description if you want to
pick up one of those bad boys for
yourself or someone you know who's like
really into angrist so the last thing
for this video is the full disclosure
part that I like to include with handi
tech the cheero ingress charger was one
of our usual sponsor spots the label
maker and the headphone adapters were
purchased for youths at Linus Media
Group here and the gate keeper was
provided by cool cat electronics for
evaluation even though I told them at
the time I probably wouldn't review it
but then I liked it so I did thanks for
watching guys like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment if your feelings were
more complicated in this as always
linked in the video description you can
support us with a monthly contribution
you can buy a cool t-shirt like this one
and you can change your amazon bookmark
to one with our affiliate code so we get
a small kickback whenever you buy
portable battery banks these doohickeys
or the duty keys
go in them so you can print more stuff
with them adaptors and do whatever the
heck thanks for watching and as always
