I've been pretty excited to do this is
the asou saber-tooth p67 motherboard so
it's part of their top series which
stands for the ultimate force which has
a very clever little logo that's
actually a tee and then a u and then an
F sort of but you get the point right
the ultimate force tough tough series
has a five-year warranty so it has
guaranteed reliability it also has a
friggin axe on the front of the box so
it is tough and will destroy you okay
here we have its support for LGA 1155 so
that means you have full support for all
of the intel core i7 core i5 and core i3
CPUs on this platform it features the P
67 chipset which means that the onboard
video on your core i7 processor will not
be supported by this board but honestly
who cares this is a performance board
you're going to want to put a nice
dedicated graphics card into it so let's
have a look at what a seuss has to say
for themselves about this board we have
thermal arm or armor which is total
airflow boosting heat dissipation will
show you that once we get it opened up
we have thermal radar real-time heat
detection and heat removal so monitors
temps in critical parts of the
motherboard in real-time automatically
adjusting fan speeds to make sure the
system maintains high stability without
overheating we have tough components so
certified by military standard for tough
duty hence the five-year warranty digi+
vrm so fully digital VRM for excellent
voltage regulation we have a front panel
USB support aa compatible theny chassis
enjoy faster throw book without
relegating cables and devices to be hard
to recreate oh so that means it has a
USB proper pin out header rather than
just a cable and that goes around to the
back of the board efi bios which is
awesome because it even supports the
scroll wheel in the graphical interface
and the bios so you can use a mouse to
change all those settings instead of the
keyboard and it has a complete USB
solution double USB access double
convenience okay what does that mean -
still facilitate strategic accessibility
for both the front and rear panel okay
well we'll see what they mean once we
get that opened up let's have a look at
the back of the board where it probably
says all the same stuff tested server
grade reliability so that's something
they haven't mentioned on the front and
now let's get it opened up and have a
look at this port this is a very unique
looking motherboard and you can't really
tell through that highly reflective
surface I suspect so it will still we're
still in suspense about what this new
tough series board looks like let's have
a look at the included accessories we
have the user's guide a utilities and
drivers DVD which you should throw away
a powered by a su sticker so download
the latest off the assess website we
have a five-year warranty notice that
comes with it as well as a thermal radar
digi+ vrm user guide cool thank you next
we have an i/o shield we have two SATA
to three gigabit per second cables and
two SATA 3 6 gigabit per second cables
although please note they are identical
other than the white color coding on the
cables they will both work with either
speed grade we have 4 mounting screws
not sure what those are for
guess we'll hopefully find out then we
have an SLI bridge very tight spacing on
the sli compatible slot I'll actually
they know that's not that tight no no
that's fine gentlemen and then we have
their cue Connect for the front case
switch
led all that good stuff as well as the
front USB 2 and finally the board itself
so normally when a Seuss's boards come
in one of these paper sleeves they
actually don't have an anti-static bag
on them but the sabre-tooth p67 seems to
be a bit of an exception to that rule
and here it is so that's the thermal
sheath that we were talking about before
you can see it has like like a plastic
covering on it okay that oh okay so
that's what these screws are for so you
can actually you have alternate mounting
screws to actually put a fan over the
Northbridge should you so desire so wow
this actually makes it kind of more
difficult for me to point out a lot of
the features of the board because I
maybe it makes it easier because I can
only see the things that qualifies
features of the board one thing that
this design will allow
you to do is have a very clean-looking
interior of your case because the only
parts you're going to be able to see are
the business parts of your board so
let's start where we usually start which
is the CPU socket very non crowded CPU
socket one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven okay I'm not sure
how many phases the power design is okay
hold on one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten okay it looks like
an eight plus two phase power design on
this guy LGA 1155 socket as I mentioned
before supports all LGA 1155 boards
because you're using the p67 chipset you
have full support for k-series unlocked
processors overclocking those things to
the max up here in the top left we have
the eight pin CPU power connector and
it's in exactly its correct location we
have our MOSFET heat sinks here as well
as here using a typical a soos Tough
Series color scheme so we've got kind of
a black rough looking paint finish as
well as like a green military rough
looking paint finish on both sides we
have full support for up to four sticks
Abdul channel ddr3 memory on can I even
get this off yeah there we go
so these are also tough tough series
looking color schemes here as well as
soos is using their quick install I
forget what the branding is for it but
basically it allows you to slide in the
modules from one side and then clip in
with only one side so you don't have to
clip in both sides at the same time we
have the mem okay button which allows
you to post with any memory sticks even
if they're not 100% compatible it'll
default to a very safe setting to allow
you to post and then adjust your memory
timings for optimal performance we have
our 24 pin power connector and it's
ideal location along the right-hand edge
and here we have a USB 3 header so that
will be for your front panel USB 3 we
are also going to find what is this okay
here we go so we have 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit
per second ports and it looks like we
have 4 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second port
so 2 of these are going to be running
off of the Intel chips
and two of them are going to be running
off some third party chipset which I
actually can't identify because most of
the board is covered so here we have our
front panel connectors that is your
front power reset LEDs all that good
stuff we have a set of three front USB
2.0 headers so that it means up to six
front USB 2.0 devices we have a front
firewire header as well as our front
audio header in terms of the PCI Express
expansion we have a pretty good looking
layout here so we have one two three
PCIe 1x slots we have two PCIe 16x slots
remember p67 boards that is all of them
are going to split these PCIe 16x slots
into dual PCIe 8 X unless they have an
NF 200 or similar chip and then finally
one lone pci slot so if you're running
sort of a mid-range configuration with
one graphics card then they leave you
one two PCIe 1x a PCIe up to eight X and
then one PCI slot and if you're running
dual graphics so a high-end config they
leave you two PCIe 1x slots and so those
are the ones that a high-end power user
is more likely to use here we have a
like shroud on the i/o cup on the i/o
shield so we have one of those ps2
keyboard mouse combo ports which I'm a
big fan of one two three four five six
seven eight USB 2.0 ports optical audio
out eSATA dual eSATA looks like yep
dually SATA and then we've also got USB
3.0 firewire Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1
audio out on the back of the motherboard
we find some mounting screws and not a
whole lot else and one thing I sort of
want to figure out here is whether it's
possible to remove the thermal armor
shield so should you so desire so I'm
sorry guys I'm going to take just a
minute here on camera and yes it looks
like you can so there's mounting screws
on the back for it there go here here
here here here here here basically
they're all over the back and it looks
like you can quite easily remove the
thermal armor if you
want so that would be totally up to you
because there may be some aspects of the
board that are more difficult to work
with with this thermal armor plate on
such as the PCIe fasten our retention
clips there so I'm going to show you
guys what I mean keep focusing that at
the board while I walk over here and go
get a graphics card so this is one thing
that might be a little bit challenging
when you've got a system completely
loaded up it might be a little bit hard
to access these these kinds of
mechanisms so you know like let's say
you've got one card you got a dual slot
card here and then you've got like
another dual slot card here so this is
like you have this much room in between
to press down on that and pull out the
card so I'm not sure how challenging
that's going to be but another thing
that might be a bit tricky is if you
have a screwdriver with a wide tip like
mine it's probably not going to fit down
here too fast in the motherboard so make
sure you have a skinny screwdriver so
those are the only considerations that
I'd probably want to be sure of oh and
other thing is you might want to make
sure you have enough clearance between
the i/o shield and like a 120 millimeter
fan mounted here in your case to make
sure that you have room for this so
those are the only considerations that I
can think of that would really be a
concern for the p67 sabertooth thank you
