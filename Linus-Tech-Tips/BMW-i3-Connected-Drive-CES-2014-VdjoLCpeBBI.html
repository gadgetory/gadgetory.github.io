brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys we're the Intel
booth checking out the BMW i3 I know we
don't review cars review computers but
this car is kind of turning into a
computer so I thought it would might be
ok before you get into the car using
your phone you can do many things you
can locate it on a map you can send maps
to it as a destination you can unlock
and lock the doors you can flash the
headlights and honk the horn you can
check your tire pressure and you can see
how much available range you have left
amongst other things and that's just
before you get into the car once you're
in the car your phone seamlessly
integrates to everything a BMW has
introduced ConnectedDrive which is a way
of syncing your phone with your car
through a pay p√≠s which is quite
wonderful something that I did while I
was in the car was actually I set up a
Pandora playlist through my phone which
was very quick and very easy to do and I
was able to set out a tweet which I've
deleted now but still which just I put
GPS data in the car and it was able to
tweet out I am going to and then bleep
like where I was going to which is
actually pretty interesting because the
whole idea with this car is you're not
supposed to type anything there's
predefined messages and stuffs that you
can quickly use there dial system to be
able to quickly access the predefined
messages and you're not supposed to be
distracted while you're driving which
honestly is not something that I can
complain about you don't install apps on
the car one thing that's interesting is
if you have older like smart enabled
cars they have apps installed on them
but they become kind of outdated after a
while and might not necessarily matter
what's cool about this cars you don't
install the apps you install them on
your phone which is really easy to
manage and then your phone syncs their
API is through the cars you can control
them with the car but it's all going
through your phone this car is smart if
you start to go outside of your range or
if you've given have given it a
destination that is outside of your
range it'll automatically react and
start trying to give you options so a
few things that I can do is give you an
option of a charging station that's
right beside public transit so you can
save your car to charge and take public
transit or it'll just show you charging
stations along the way and give you
optional destinations like mini
destinations so you can stop there along
your route also if you're worried about
that at all there's this two cylinder
650cc repurposed motorcycle engine which
you can use as a generator to charge up
the car
if you're nowhere near a charging
station but charging stations are
becoming much more common these days the
concierge service is wonderful it's
about $250 for three years to get 3G
access to the car and then that enables
a whole bunch of different functionality
about maps and all this other kind of
stuff because the car will have 3G so it
can show you where it is on a map and a
bunch of other things and then on top of
that there's $150 for three years charge
for concierge which breaks down to about
$50 per year which is really not that
bad for how awesome it is you just press
a button on the car and then someone
connects to you through phone service
through the car and then you can ask
them anything so something I did was I
asked them for bubble tea so I'm gonna
ask them for bubble tea in Las Vegas
Brandon let me help you get some bubble
tea in Las Vegas I do apologize sure
what was the first part of that I was
wondering if we could get bubble tea in
Las Vegas just a moment I'll pull it up
Frank no problem I did pull it up about
three miles away from you looks like the
closer that sounds great by any chance
do you know if they have honeydew bubble
tea yeah I can hold their website just
alone to do that sounds great and you
can push that map to my car yeah it
should be available shortly perfect
thank you very much well caught one a
first name say you got into an accident
one really cool thing this car can do is
detect what type of accident was so say
you flipped or you rolled or you got
rear-ended or you rear-ended someone
else it can then figure out how many
people were in the car and try and
figure out how severe the accident was
and call emergency services and get them
there as soon as possible
although this car is quite protected
because it is made out of carbon fiber
it's still good to know that that
security blanket is there again guys I
know we don't review cars but this car
is practically a computer so I thought I
would do it anyways it's incredible how
connected this car in once you get into
the car you you you realize that it is a
experience based on your phone it is
experience based on wireless data is
experience based on how everything else
in the technical community is moving
cars are finally getting to that point
in my opinion so as always thank you for
watching this video if you liked this
video want to see other CES 2014 videos
which probably won't be about cars be
sure to subscribe to Linus tech tips and
as always thank you to our sponsors NCIX
