heavy motherboard the saber-tooth x79
has an extremely heavy box and I'm not a
hundred percent sure oh man
oops I wonder what that is uh I'm not a
hundred percent sure why that would be
but let's get into this board so it has
it is a tough series board tof the
ultimate 4 Series board with a five-year
warranty guaranteed reliability terms
and conditions may apply um
PCI Express 3.0 compatibility this is an
ex 79 board which means it is compatible
with all of Intel's latest LGA 2011
processors and is compatible with
crossfire X and SLI and when we open it
up we'll find a bunch of cool stuff so
you got thermal armor total airflow
boosting heat dissipation so that is the
cooler okay
Thermal radar real-time temp detection
and heat removal okay so okay monitors
temperatures and critical parts of the
motherboard in real-time automatically
adjusting fan speeds to make sure the
main system maintains high stability
without overheating oh that's kind of
neat automatically calculates ideal fan
speeds based on different parameters
selected by users for each component
keeping everything cooler and
longer-lasting
neat new did you pass power control so
this is something that they implemented
on X 79 is an all-new DIGI+ power
control so that is digital power control
for both the CPU and the DRAM very cool
top components certified by military
standard okay robust chokes capacitors
and MOSFETs certified through third
party military group testing Oh their
SSD caching is supported so if you don't
have an OC z synapse drive and if you
don't have as at 68 chipset to use until
SRT you can use this on these cc's x79
boards that support this feature USB 3
boat boost allows you to use devices
with you asp that is a faster way of
interfacing with USB 3 drives finally
USB bios flashback which is the smartest
thing that i've pretty much ever seen on
a motherboard ever because it allows you
without any components installed that is
no cpu and no ram installed to flash the
bios just using a USB drive with the
BIOS file loaded on it
holy smokes right that mean
if Intel releases a new CPU and we have
old inventory in our warehouse at NCIX
and we ship you the new CPU that the
board doesn't support yet and the old
inventory board which is the same board
but just with a different firmware
revision and you plug it in and it
doesn't work you go oh no my systems DOA
and then a sue says oh no there's a
firmware update there's a BIOS update
and then you go well I don't have
another CPU now that no longer matters
that's so cool because it means it's
reducing end-user RMA's it's reducing
end-user hassle and it's better for the
retailers and the manufacturers
everybody wins with that feature very
cool CPU installation guide cool top
stickers IO shield user guide including
a useless DVD inside which you should
download the latest off the Asus website
Tough Series motherboard five-year
warranty notice as well as a certificate
of reliability included accessories are
4 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second cables to
say 2 3 6 key SATA 2 3 skitty bit per
second cables front Q connectors a fan
which probably goes somewhere
and an SLI connector that is a very
short SLI bridge I have a feeling I'm
not gonna like the PCI Express slots
facing on this board I mean the reality
of it is 99% of people still are not
using dual graphics cards even let me
buy high-end boards so you know I'm not
gonna get my panties to much in an
automatic but see that's funny how do
they do that
okay I guess that's okay why does this
look so short to me okay nevermind it's
okay that's fine that's that's that's
definitely adequate spacing alright so
this is looking like a pretty slick
little board here why don't we go ahead
and take these stickers off I already
talked about all those things except the
UEFI BIOS it does have a UEFI BIOS which
just means it's a graphical user
interface you can use your mouse rather
than just the keyboard to navigate it
and let's start on the back because I
felt something interesting back there
yes we have a heat sink on the vrm
components on the back of the board
we've also got our standard LGA 2011
backplate which makes it much much
easier for manufacturers to design
awesome
aftermarket cooling solutions for this
board that are going to be retained in a
way that is not going to have them fall
off and put adequate mounting pressure
onto the CPU I love seeing that
backplate built-in it's a higher quality
decision thank you Intel 96 that was
Intel right right right
on that note okay uh-oh you know what
it's too far away but something to
consider if you're buying an ex 79 board
is you might want to think about getting
a case such as the antique 1100 which
has a fan on the back that will allow
you to actively cool these components on
the back of the board as well as the
back of the PCB itself because a lot of
heat radiates out of the back of a
motherboard PCB so now let's have a look
at the overall layout so you got your
LGA 2011 socket a seuss much to their
pride has implemented eight DIMM slots
on all of their x79 boards and kudos to
them because they have gone with the
full x79 solution rather than just
putting on four dimm slots which is
still quad-channel by the way I've had
people complain about x79 boards
including this one I think there's a
comment on the video for this board
right here saying oh why only dual
channel memory on an x79 board optimal
channel memory it's quad channel memory
for dims quad channel memory it's just
on whether or not you can actually put
two dimms per channel okay guys so this
one support students for Channel eight
dims total I don't have that many
fingers for up to 64 gigs of memory
using currently available stuff
very neat 8 pin connector and it's ideal
location along the top left edge of the
board we've got a pretty good-looking
cooler over here but the key part is
this heat pipe right here which leads to
an even better cooler over here so
there's a fan which can be installed by
taking out those screws and putting in
the fan here which is going to give you
better cooling for your vrm components
and I would highly recommend installing
that because this is a very limited
amount of space to cool the voltage or
the power delivery circuitry for a very
power hungry CPU I've got a memo k
button which allows you to boot with
pretty much any memory off the hop as
long as it's functional 24-pin connector
in its ideal location front USB 3 header
in its ideal location I've started
calling that that we've got all the
Intel SATA ports so these are your SATA
3 6 gigabit per second parts
there's your 4 SATA 2
gigabit per second ports as well as
running off a third-party Marvel
controller these are the ones that
support SSD caching so that's where
you'd plug your SSD and your hard drive
into and those are also say two three
six gigabit per second let's go ahead
and move over here there's your front
panel ports there's your clear CMOS
although I hope there's one on the back
panel yes there no there is not
yes there it no there is not fascinating
okay well there's your clear CMOS huh
there's another one okay ah there's your
front USB to four of those it's also got
your front panel audio and then your PCI
Express slot leo so yeah like I said
this is not what I thought it was it's
okay I thought it was one two three but
actually it's one two three four and
then the other one there's one more
space so if you did want to do a
three-way configuration this is probably
not the ideal board for it because those
ones would have the tighter spacing but
this one is best optimized for two I
also see there there TPU so what that
means is that this board supports their
automated overclocking which if you
check out on my NCI XCOM channel they're
automated overclocking utility
absolutely blows away the competitors
all overclocking utilities with the one
button setup blows away their
competitors one button overclocking
utilities because it achieved a much
higher overclock and it was still stable
um what else we got here 16 x16 x8 X in
case you guys were wondering one PCI
slot although I don't really know what
that's doing on such a high end board 2
PCIe 1x slots and let's have a look at
what we got for i/o on the back here we
go we've got a ps2 keyboard mouse combo
part I still like seeing these they are
still handy 1 2 3 4 USB 3.0 ports 1 2 3
4 5 USB 2.0 ports a firewire port
isaw that's powered eSATA that's regular
eSATA we've got optical audio out as
well as the USB flash back port right
there Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1 audio out
