cycle Wireless end router it is the nbg
forty six one five and one of the things
that's actually really cool about it
right off the bat is the fact that it
includes not one but two built-in USB
ports so with that in mind let's go
ahead and do the unboxing portion of
this video right away so that I can show
you the product itself because that is
important showing you the product
because if I didn't unboxing or I don't
show you the product it would be over
right about now first of all we have a
warranty card thank you for purchasing
and our warranty is oh whoa it opens up
that helps a lot ok so it looks like it
is I don't know how long it is ok either
way you can fill it out with your model
number and serial number ending of
searches purchase okay we have a Quick
Start Guide although you're probably not
going to use this too much because it
does include besides the expert
configuration mode also an easy
configuration mode so that should help
for the non-technical zli savvy
customers to get this baby set up you
also have support for a WPS so that's
where you just press the button on the
router press the button on the adapter
and the secure connection is done
automatically we have a utility users
guide Quick Start Guide Acrobat Reader
and product registration discs actually
there's some useful stuff on there you
might not want to throw that disc away
just yet we have the router itself which
is fairly small this I like to see I'm
kind of it's getting tiresome seeing
like huge routers that are like trying
to be a fashion statement so this is
just a plain mossy white finish on the
top of the router itself and then you
have LEDs indicating all the different
stuff that it does so you got your power
LED you've got your for land LEDs your
one.when LED your wireless LED and then
LEDs for the two USB ports you know a
lot more on the router in a moment let's
show you all the other things it comes
with next we have a power adapter which
looks like that we have an Ethernet
cable which is yellow
see that's just a little bit different
no I think this one comes with a yellow
Ethernet cable everyone else comes with
a blue or a black Ethernet cable will
these got gonna break the mold yellow
Ethernet cable also instead of being a
lame three-foot Ethernet cable that some
of the some routers come with this is
actually a six-foot cable so there you
have it bull plated connectors - all
right next we have two antennas not one
but two I'm not gonna try and get those
how's the packaging right now I will go
like this okay and then finally we have
the router itself so let's show you the
overall physical layout of the nbg 46:15
so on the sides you see we have our two
USB ports so that's actually I mean okay
yes they call it out on the front of the
box and you know USB port but that's
actually a really cool feature because
not only can you use it to access your
printer over the network you can also
plug in a mass storage device such as a
USB Drive or an external hard drive at
the same time so I haven't actually seen
any other consumer router in this kind
of a price point range that does offer
that feature what else do they have to
say for themselves here Wi-Fi compliant
with the 802 N and backwards compatible
with B and G hey then I got something to
do with the name of the router the nbg
okay next we have wireless scheduling
for energy saving well that's actually
kind of cool - my rotor at home doesn't
have that so you can turn off the I mean
that's never mind energy saving I mean
yeah it's good for energy saving too but
you can turn off the antenna during
hours of the day when you don't want it
on like at night for example next we've
got Wi-Fi Protected setup talked about
that already six level neighbor friendly
Wireless output power control that's
actually cool - so that's a way that you
can actually adjust the signal strength
of the wireless and
well not the antenna but the actual
router itself in order to keep it from
being too accessible so if you live in
an apartment or a condo for example you
can turn it down in six different
incremental steps to a level that allows
access throughout your entire living
space but doesn't necessarily punch
through two sets of walls and go to the
people to condos over who managed to
guess that your wireless password was
your pet's name
okay next and can enhance security with
WEP WPA w8 PA - and a firewall that's
all pretty much standard fare and let me
see what else they have to say about
this particular guy right here I think
that's pretty much it
oh it has a game engine feature
evidently okay so you can turn that on
to optimize it for games you can easily
prioritize your network traffic with
quality of service so you can set
different things to lower or higher
priorities so for example if your house
is not run by me the gaming thing might
be at the bottom but if it is run by me
that might be at the top in order to
maximize your well not maximize your
pings minimize your pings maximize your
gaming experience on the back of the
unit itself we have our two antenna
ports our convenient on/off physical
switch for the wireless network we have
our WPS button as well as a reset button
recessed into a little port down there
use a needle get at that okay we have
four LAN ports and we have one one port
our DC power in as well as a complete
on/off switch for the router unit itself
and finally another antenna port so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the nbg 46 1 5 don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from our
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos these are gigabit ports Wow this
is actually a tremendous value for the
price point that it's at gigabit
ethernet ports Wireless and there you
have it now I'm actually done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
