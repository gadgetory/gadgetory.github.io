you're a gamer and you've got your
gaming rig in your gaming monitor and
you've got some important gaming to do
and on the other hand you're a total
basic bitch and you own that so today is
the basic gaming setup where we will be
creating the best gaming desktop it
bleep tanner we can order with only
products from Amazon basics Origin PC
origin PC builds custom desktops laptops
with free 24/7 lifetime tech support and
they use high-end brand name components
like Samsung's 970 Evo Pro and got two
SSD visit origin PC at the link below
for a special offer
okay well you don't have anything to put
that on yeah I know I'm just I'm
completing as much of the setup as I can
right now there why not utilize yeah I'm
going basics monitor Stan okay so
basically if your monitor doesn't come
with a height adjustable stand or like I
mean it doesn't have pivot does it no it
doesn't do that either so basically it's
just height adjustment I think it tells
that she'll pivot hands Ken its
advertisers only at supporting 24 inch
monitors but I've read you can put a 27
inch on there but your mileage may vary
in terms of the pivot you might not be
able to get into portrait mode but who
has a 24 have we investigated whether it
is actually cost-effective to buy a
cheapo monitor and then put a basics
stand on it I see this is the thing I'm
not sure how many people actually need
this on the one hand it seems super
obscure but on the other hand Amazon is
making this product so must be in demand
isn't the whole thing with Amazon basics
but they do the most in demand stuff
okay you did it oh it's not like I
wouldn't describe this thing as amazing
hear that sound well it's a little too
heavy you're gonna have to tilt it for
sure okay I'll hold the base the base is
not very heavy wait a second I think
we're gonna make it I wonder if people
are trying to rotate it like this and
they're not realizing that on even a lot
of likes factory stands you have to tilt
in order to rotate and I'll give you an
Amazon basics DisplayPort cable how much
does one of these gonna cost me six
bucks depends on the length though
that's a six footer that's not bad it's
only outfitted for a DisplayPort 1.2
though so even though that has the same
bandwidth as 1.4 there are some some
features I mean the thing with that
though is that there's no actual pin
difference so it's just a matter of like
what they're comfortable rating it at is
quite possible it worked just fine for
DP 1.4 it just might not Wow
we bought a PC power cord I hope it
didn't cost much we literally
have a gigantic Rubbermaid bin of these
yeah but do they have the Amazon basics
does that actually Sam's on basics on it
no I think it's a pretty generic
gas-powered quart well it was $7 a lot
of people were giving it one star
because they said that these holes were
too small what I think they're trying to
just plug so for those of you out there
who are even more basic than me
that's how it is intended to be used and
it works just fine
nice nice snug fit perfectly adequate
basic but adequate the other end is
gonna go into okay just free outlet
surge protector wall tap with two USB
ports so you plug that bad boy into your
wall outlet and you get a quick charging
a regular charging and three outlets now
to be clear about recommending plugging
a wall tap into a Power squid but we're
not really drawing a lot of power here
so that's one amp that's 2.4 amps the
second thing to keep in mind is at the
top a negative comment is entitled lit
my house on fire they're safe
the amazonbasics cable sleeve with
zipper 20 inch black 4-pack so this is
actually kind of cool basically you just
put your wires in there and you zip it
up now that you got that set up it's
time for you to sit down in your $70
amazonbasics chair I have a chair yeah
lots of different chairs this one was
just kind of cheap and easy actually
it's not that bad I will say that the
the cushioning down here this is a this
is a pretty like it's a pretty hard like
a pretty firm cushion which is actually
a better thing than you might expect
because if you have like a really plush
cushion what happens to it over time is
it just becomes not really a cushion and
then you're just sitting on the piece of
what is usually plywood on the bottom
amazonbasics microfiber cloths or
electronic
how many things did you buy the next
thing is pretty much the reason we
actually made this video it's because
they made this this is the Amazon basics
mechanical feel gaming keyboard okay so
it's got five programmable macro keys
this should be worth about twenty seven
ninety five is thirty six okay it's not
far off no I wouldn't buy this there was
a bunch of actual mechanical keyboards I
mean granted they used yeah I need
switches but so I'm never in the $40
range $45 maybe they were trying to go
from mechanical sound cuz you've got a
couple keys that sounds kind of you
can't like loud loud I think what they
should call this is the loud membrane
keyboard mouse followed by the free
button USB wired mouse oh you made poor
Tyler inventory all this stuff Oh a desk
pad alright what do you think would be a
good price for that I'd pay $14.99 well
you actually did paid $24.99 so that's
their anti fraying strategy it seems to
be to burn it and they end up with
actually quite a noticeable - there's a
shine to the edge and it's kind of sharp
you know what I just wouldn't buy this
actually I would just buy something
better we have no internet oh that's too
bad maybe what you need is the rj45
cat5e Ethernet patch cable from Amazon
basics thank you or if you prefer the
USB Wi-Fi sure you know what I don't
prefer the USB Wi-Fi adapter but I'll
open it anyway just to humor you
adorable it's happy to see me see this
seems fine are you see things a little
stiff actually this is apparently not an
amazing cable the jacket is prone to
cracking and when it does well it'll
crack along the length of the cable on a
cable this short like 15 feet it's less
of an issue where you really run into
trouble with this these cheap outer
jackets is when you have a longer cable
and you go even if you over/under it
when you wind it up for storage
you'll still run into a situation where
you try to kind of you know throw it
down and it's just a kinky mess I
probably wouldn't buy this either I've
had my disputes with monoprice over the
years but credit where credit's do
they're cheap cables are less cheap 63%
oh you could probably use a little
charger here using Amazon basics USBC a
USBC cable it's a little better than the
network cable I wouldn't describe it as
amazing though to their credit though
they're using the more expensive
connector housings that don't have the
split down the one side they cost a
little more okay well there was supposed
to be a gaming headset but I think it's
a pretty new amazonbasics product so it
takes between one and three months to
ship so even though we got it in October
it's not here until like mid December so
I got I did get you a little blue to be
a portable bluetooth speaker great but
that's not enough for your desktop setup
micro-b did they not have like a sound
bar or something it really does not
sound very good
ultra the 4k HDR model so this is
interesting it seems like the way that
the audio profile is tuned even the
standard profile it's really emphasizing
vocals and I can barely even hear the
background music of this video you
notice that like it's just it's just
like a dialogue enhancer for your TV
I mean PC gaming is so complicated why
not just stick to console gaming oh wow
they do an Xbox one clone controller
well that is a weird texture oh yeah can
you not hear that it's got like a really
kind of grippy kind of feel to the back
here is this hard to be backlit okay so
it has different modes it can go off
okay there's a different color this is
breathing different colors yeah it's
hard to me okay
is that it well I think if you want more
functionality you need to install the
Amazon basics keyboard software now the
keyboard is not good the sound bar is
not good unless I was just trying to
hear you know the Weather Channel better
you know the other thing with the sound
bar is that it's supposed to come with a
remote but ours just didn't what the oh
wow I just got killed by easy BOTS
anyway I can't stand to watch you
struggle with that free quick basic
Mouse here they do make a gaming mouse I
do prefer the mouse to the keyboard so
there's that we get presumably dpi
adjustments we get a back and a forward
button which are bait I would consider
basic features in the year 2018 not
present on this one and we also get a
braided cable which I was recently made
aware that not everyone prefers because
apparently they can get snagged on stuff
to my experience I don't really get my
braided cable snagged on thing also has
onboard memory so you can save your
configs on the go cool and 3200 dpi
okay and $24 actually feels a little bit
jittery at super high sensitivity it's
definitely more comfortable than the
other one quite heavy though like
surprisingly heavy given how well basic
it is this is too boring you should be
yelling at your teammates with this
professional USB condenser microphone
alright more basics the most gratuitous
packaging in the whole lot it's got a
one of those standard mounts so that you
can put it on an arm if you're into that
sort of thing it actually has height
adjust as well okay give it a chance you
know what it actually does straighten
out a fair bit so this is what I would
sound like if I was yelling at my
teammates they're actually talking more
normally to my teammates you can see I
peaked a little bit there so we're gonna
go ahead and experience that there's no
tactile feedback oh wow and that is
let's see that is quite a bit that is
quite a bit quieter now and we are
getting up into the
range less often so and my Blake
broadcast thank you for that are you
these next two things are kind of better
if you are trying to get a one chord
solution for your laptop like your
docking your laptop and making it into a
desktop you might want one of these you
know this is a weird complaint but this
chord is kind of long you wouldn't be
saying that if you were trying to plug
that into the back here of course
everyone right now that's true so what
it should really be is detachable it
should be a Type C to type C and then it
should just come with a cable and you
should be able to swap it out that's
that would be better there there's our
basic placement for it
so this is a USB 3 external hard drive
enclosure you get to provide your own
hard drive comes with a couple little
foam inserts which are presumably to
keep your hard drive safe if you have a
thin hard drive I don't know the top is
metal but the majority that part is
pretty plastic this is this is it this
is what holds you drive I guess you just
stick it to the top of the drive that is
very basic at 20 bucks is probably fine
this is a very low quality USB cable
that's included like that is very thin
for a USB 3 cable so the side with the
branding and not the like FCC sticker on
it goes down if you don't want to put
like strain on the connector or have
your drive supported by just this one
point here so I'm yeah I don't like this
one very much than this oh the external
hard drive case yeah this is very
mediocre for 6 bucks it's fine
for any more than that I probably I
would probably opt for something else
the amazonbasics multi tip stylus for
touchscreen devices that's an
interesting idea so multi tip stylus
instead of just shipping it with
multiple tips they just used every
possible end of a pen type device to put
a different tip so you got a big fat one
you got a medium one and you got a
skinny one yeah which is that's seven
six and five millimeters respect okay so
you could go fat skinny
fazt medium or skinny medium like
there's kind of a lot of mush to them I
don't think any of these are really fine
or sharp enough to really write with now
you probably have more success if you
had a nice comfortable amazonbasics
footrest actually that feels not bad
it's got grip unlike the IKEA ones that
we use here at the office it's not as
high though I don't think I'll give it a
shot
also one thing I already don't really
like about it is that it's it swivels
too easily a lot better overall feel and
thus kidness on the floor than the IKEA
one but it just if you just kind of man
I don't even know if you just took like
some some silicone crap and just kind of
like gummed it up a little bit or
something I think you could I think you
could you know for less than a dollar
you could DIY it better oh this is five
thousand sheets and Amazon basics paper
wha-hey it's fine let's take your new
Amazon basic stapler for a spin really
is it like I say it's a safety mechanism
well that sucks because often like if
you want if you want to staple something
to the wall or whatever you open up the
state plain you just oh that's a bummer
yeah those shoulder ones are so loud
yeah like this is not this is not great
I mean I still manage to score one goal
yeah go line this butt so how do you
feel about your hit twenty one dollars
twenty one but you know what 421 bucks
I'm pretty okay with it quite frankly so
how do you feel overall about your new
basic battle station you know I like the
DisplayPort cable one advantage we
didn't mention before is that it doesn't
require the lock so it's just a
self-locking one you don't have to deal
with like pressing the thing in order to
unlatch it these cable management
sleeves honestly if you're trying to get
something done quick they can improve
the look of behind your desk a fair bit
come on I bet they yeah like that helps
a lot and they're neoprene I like the
monitor stand believe it or not I think
at 40 bucks I'd probably rather have one
of the ones that just clip onto the desk
personally but if you don't want that if
you just want to convert a vase amount
monitor to this or replace a broken
stand honestly I'm okay with that one
the gaming mouse is alright actually
it's it's I think it's too heavy to
really like game on it like I would
consider it more like just a mouse but
it's fine the grip on the side is makes
it easy to lift off even though it is a
little bit on the heavy side and not not
a big fan of the keyboard a big
disappointment in the keyboard at 20
bucks this is fine I actually stopped
noticing that scuffing on my arm pretty
quickly maybe I was just busy filming a
video and wasn't paying attention but it
seems like less of a big deal now that
I'm your mileage may vary on that
mileage may vary
oh good cable that's working this cable
seems fine I don't know there isn't
really any conclusion like none of it
really like blew me away but none of it
was complete and utter garbage actually
a couple of them were pretty bad the
ethernet cable was bad I wouldn't use
this hard drive dock and I wouldn't buy
this keyboard there are much better
keyboard options didn't blow me away but
you know what does blow me away
