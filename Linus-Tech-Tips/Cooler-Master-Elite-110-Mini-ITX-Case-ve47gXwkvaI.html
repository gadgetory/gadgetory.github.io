video this is a tiny tiny little pc case
that holds a tiny tiny little Bell piece
I mean I guess you could put anything in
it but it is specifically designed to
hold a PC hotspot shield service makes
your internet browsing safer more secure
and fully private click now to learn
more let's start with the packaging
fairly straightforward fairly thin
fairly lightweight hard foam but because
it is such a small case and you can't
really build a computer that's heavy
enough for it to be a problem I'm okay
with that this time around we'll go with
an external tour for the start here at
the front you find mesh on the side you
find mesh on the top you find mesh on
the other side you find mesh and at the
back you find well mesh on the power
supply I guess and then more ventilation
when you're trying to cram an entire PC
with discrete graphics end up to a 4770k
cpu into something the small you'll need
all the ventilation you can get in the
elite 110 delivers here in terms of
front i/o it's pretty standard fare
we've got 2 USB 3.0 ports headphone and
microphone jacks a hard drive activity
led a reset switch and then the front
coolermaster logo is actually a power
switch there is no five and a quarter
inch babe most people aren't using those
these days so I'm not too worried about
it and there wouldn't really be room for
it anyway which you'll see once we open
it up at the back you can see that even
though the elite 110 is a small package
that doesn't prevent it from having a
pretty decent sized bulge on it sorry
it's so the power supply does stick out
the back a little bit what this does is
it gives you about an extra 20
millimetres of clearance internally so
that you can fit a fairly normal sized
power supply on the inside again even
though the case is so small the top
casing comes off with four thumb screws
that I'm just going to go ahead and
remove here and pull this baby off so
you can see it fits on a little
something like that and then once we get
on the inside we can see it supports 280
mm
your fans here on the side however
that's only if you don't need a dual
slot graphics card which we opted to
install this is Linus tech tips guys not
Linus and namby-pamby tips we're
hardcore
we won't settle for on border single
slot graphics cards if we don't
absolutely have to
now with that set on coolermaster site
they don't really show it being used the
way that we're using it and the case
seems optimized for onboard graphics or
a smaller graphics card with more
storage as opposed to being designed for
people who are trying to put a full-on
gaming rig inside but I guess the only
way to find out if this works is to
check our temperatures at the end and
see how it went in the front it supports
either a 140 millimeter or 120
millimeter fan that takes advantage of
that mesh and you have the option to
install a 120 millimeter radiator the
manual and product page don't specify
the thickness that's supported but I
went with a side in 120 XL so given that
that went in there just fine with actual
actually a fair bit more clearance to go
I would say pretty much anything should
fit okay
in terms of CPU cooler support it can
handle a 76 millimeter or 3 inch CPU
cooler not much space between the socket
and the power supply up here so using a
stock cooler as an option but not many
aftermarket CPU air coolers will fit in
there which to me made that liquid
cooler in the front a no-brainer for our
core i7 processor I was easily able to
cram the tubing in here between the
power supply and the motherboard even
though there wouldn't have been much
space for airflow otherwise you can it
can handle up to a 180 millimeter power
supply that's in terms of length other
than that it's a standard ps2 form
factor but shorter is much better
I used a 160 millimeter power supply and
this is a modular one which gives me a
little bit more flexibility in terms of
using less cables and not having to
cable manage as much and this was about
right for me I think trying to do a 180
millimeter power supply in there would
be quite a bit more challenging in terms
of cable management now it's a mini ITX
case which means that even though there
are two expansion slots back here
there's only one internally so this is
just for if you have something like a
dual slot card Coolermaster does support
dual slot graphics cards then as you
know but not as long as you might
normally see in a case that's a little
bit bigger so it supports up to a 210
millimeter graphics card but there are a
couple of things that you'll have to
consider if you want to get a 21
centimeter card in there number one is
that you're going to want a card that
has a top mounted PCI Express connector
or you're going to have to factor that
in when you're taking your measurements
because it has a rear one you're going
to need a little bit of extra space for
that cable at the back of the card
number two is you're going to want to
make sure you have a strategy for what
to do with all the cables and wires that
you're going to have to hide in the
front from the front panel connectors
like the front USB 3 so what I did was I
kind of crammed them into this corner
but I found that that ate up a little
bit of the space that I would have had
for a graphics card that took up the
entire length inside and a big part of
the reason for that is because I'm using
a radiator if it wasn't for the radiator
I could put a fan grill on that front
fin and then not have to worry as much
about the the space available on the
front so I squeezed the graphics card in
at the end I didn't have too much
trouble with it I mean at all it all
worked just fine just make sure as
you're building you're managing your
cables correctly to ensure that you're
able to get everything in there either
way whatever you're doing I recommend
leaving the front bezel actually
detached you can just pull it off at the
front right here until the very end
because that'll give you a little bit
more room to work with and install all
those cards as you're building the
system now in terms of hard drive
support I wanted a challenge when it
came to hard drive installation so I
well okay I guess I actually just kind
of did it wrong and to go back and do it
over I might turn the drives around so
you can see I have the mounted
connectors towards the back and they're
supposed to be mounted connectors
towards right so I would I would turn
the drives around and put the cables on
the other side and I would definitely
install drives in the top slots before
populating the side especially if I have
mid-range graphics card in here it's a
260 X in there the way that I do because
that's putting a lot of that graphics
card heat next to my drives which is
going to be bad for them in the longer
term in the end it worked
and the fact that this case supports up
to two three and a half inch drives and
two two and a half inch drives or three
three and a half inch drives or four two
and a half inch drives is pretty darn
impressive given the size and when we
see our temperature tests you're going
to see that even with the hard drives in
sort of their worst case scenario
locations it actually performs all right
after finishing my build I did have one
piece of criticism I wish the manual was
a little bit better I've already brought
this up with Coolermaster but step by
step build instructions and some useful
guidance in terms of part selection
would go a long way towards making the
build process more enjoyable the manual
is well written and professionally made
but I would just like to see it go a
little bit deeper but to be frank if
that's what I have to complain about
rather than things like you know what
was the overall build quality like then
I guess they're doing pretty well there
were no rough edges no things that could
have caught me know things that that
really bothered me or I looked and I
went really what were they thinking when
they did that but I've come to expect
this from Coolermaster so it's hard to
remember to mention that kind of stuff
and in fact it's not even in my script
so there you go I just remembered now so
with all that out of the way let's talk
results playing Far Cry 3 with the GPU
usage pinned at a hundred percent
yielded 90-degree temps on the r7 260x
that I have tucked away in that little
corner in there that might sound high
but remember guys these modern GPUs are
actually designed to ramp their fan
speeds to target a specific temperature
and that card was reaching about 72% fan
speed to maintain that 90 degrees yeah
it's a little bit on the loud ish side
but it's not unreasonable by any means
and when you consider the stupid way my
drives were installed such a my graphics
card really doesn't have much access to
fresh air it's obvious it could do a
little bit better with more forethought
CPU temperatures of course we're much
better at an impressive 55 degrees max
but that makes sense because it's liquid
cooled and access to fresh outside air
for the radiator does wonders here it's
drawing that fresh air right in from the
outside so overall the system is
extremely small extremely compact runs
quiet at idle but of course gets a
little bit louder under gaming
and I'd say the elite 110 if you're
trying to build a tiny little system
with good ventilation gets a definite
thumbs up from me guys thank you for
watching this video
like it if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment and let
me know do you prefer small cases like
this or would you rather we do more
coverage of things like behalf stacker
for example like large more maybe more
versatile but certainly less us space
conscious solutions I guess there's a
couple more things to mention guys we do
have a link to support us in the video
description you can do anything from
direct monthly contributions which
helped us out an immense amount all the
way to changing over your Amazon toolbar
