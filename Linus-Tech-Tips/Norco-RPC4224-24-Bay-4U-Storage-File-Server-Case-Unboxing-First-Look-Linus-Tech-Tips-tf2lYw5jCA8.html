something a little bit different I don't
think we've done anything like this okay
so this is a computer case this is
probably the largest computer case we've
unboxed on the show before it comes in a
stylish brown box which includes no
information about the product inside
whatsoever except for a part number so
ten points if you know what this is
already although I really doubt it
because it's a brand new product from
norco tech now Norco Tech is a little
bit different from Norco that makes
bicycles now Norco is not really focused
on you know what kind of high end video
card fits in their case or you know how
many you know stylish plastic bezel
designs they have or what kind of
aluminum chassis they're using Norco is
all about functionality on the cheap so
this is a for you ATX case that is
designed you know I'm just gonna have to
bring this down to the ground because
there's no way I cannot
oh so heavy it's a for you ATX standard
case that is designed to load up with as
many hard drives as you could pretty
much need as a home user so let's just
keep working on getting this box open
you can see it is double boxed to
protect it during transit and here is
the case itself so on this thing weighs
like about as much as I do so I'm gonna
have to find some way to unbox it and
this may be my most difficult unboxing
yet so we're going to go ahead tope it
this way and then tilt it this way and
finally there it is the our PC 4224 so
for it is a for you case I don't
remember what the first two stands for
but the 24 means it holds 24 hard drives
so let's go ahead and put this down over
here like I said steel construction it's
not going to fall apart they actually
have a wide variety of rack mountable
chassis that are designed for just
building little file servers and what
makes them great for home users is the
backpack
unlike enterprise-level chassis or or
bare bones they're cheap this case only
costs in the mid hundreds versus what
you might pay for something from a Super
Micro or from another rack-mountable
chassis brand which might be as much as
a thousand dollars just for the chassis
itself so like I said 24 hot-swappable
three and a half inch also two and a
half inch compatible you can see it has
two and a half inch mounting holes hard
drive bays okay and these all run off a
very large backplane now I might have to
run inside and get a screwdriver so just
pause that video okay so we got the case
open that was step number one so I want
the cameraman to come have a look at the
inside of the case which is where we
will find all of the things that make
this otherwise very plain steel box
worth a lot of money and what make this
one a particularly good value compared
to the other stuff out on the market so
first I want you to have a look at the
inside here the interface that actually
runs that 24 Drive hot-swappable like
massive storage compartment here so this
this whole part of the case is dedicated
to
this backplane okay so you can see here
there are actually two redundant power
inputs I'm not talking about the fans
yet Cameron there are two redundant
power inputs so if you're using a
redundant power supply it means you take
one mole X from each redundant power
supply and plug it into each of these
two mole X here so you can see there's a
total of six okay so that's six times
four is twenty-four
alright so that means twelve six on each
power supply and then over a little bit
further you can see there are SFF 8087
connectors so there's a total of six of
those each of which runs four drives on
each one of these PCBs here you can
actually remove these although it's not
really necessary to do so and I can't
really think of a reason to do it but
I'm gonna do it anyway because that's
what unboxing is all about like you know
just taking stuff apart for the oh there
it is okay so you can see here we've got
activity LEDs we've got the actual SATA
or SAS you can run either SATA ii or SAS
drives off of this backplane so we can
see we have the four interfaces here
there's the connector I was talking
about here's the power inputs so this
distributes data to all four drives and
this distributes power to all four
drives redundantly so even if one of
your power supplies fails in a case like
this if you're using a redundant power
supply the other one will continue to
power the drives the case does not
though are the the system does not even
need to be shut down so now if I can
figure out how to get this back in there
that would be tremendous
and my battery ran out okay now let's
talk fans so this case includes six what
appear to be 80 millimeter fans all the
ones at the back might be note I think
these are all 80 millimeter so these
ones here the four that are mounted on
kind of a mid plate those are all a
single set of Blade fans now I get it
yeah they're normal fans okay as opposed
to the counter-rotating fans at the back
I'll get more into those when we talk
about them but these eight eight four
eighty millimeter fans draw air through
the front of the case so if you look at
the front of the case we have
ventilation holes over every single hard
drive so they pull air through there and
then all the way through the entire
interface back here and then push it
into the case so these are all about
static pressure these are going to be
high rpm fans they actually all run off
a single molex connector though which is
very convenient they've already gone and
wired all of the fan don't move around
so much they've gone and wired all of
the fans into a little PCB down at the
bottom of the case so I'm going to tilt
this so you can have a look down there
so you just like that so the power goes
in there and then gets distributed to
all four fans so these are going to be
quite loud for you cases in fact any
rack-mountable case is generally not
designed with silence in mind so that's
something you have to bear in mind if
you wanted to build yourself a file
server based on a case like this you
would either want to replace the fans
with something quieter mind you remember
there's loud fans in here for a reason
there's a lot of heat being generated if
you actually have twenty four hard
drives running in here so you want to
make sure you're removing it effectively
or ultimately you can go ahead and throw
it in like some closet somewhere where
you don't have to listen to it alright
let's move into the actual motherboard
compartment you can see this is an e ATX
motherboard compartment that means you
can put in up to an e ATX motherboard
although the beauty of an Orko's cases
is you can just use a standard ATX power
supply a standard ATX board if you want
to build yourself a simple home server
and boom you're done so
you've got seven PCI expansion slots and
I want to have a closer look at these
counter-rotating fans you can't really
see it too well from the phone maybe you
can maybe you can ok so there's actually
two full sets of blades the reason for
that is because at the back of the case
you've only got three fans so one power
supply fan 280 millimeter fans here that
actually have to move out all of the air
that those four at the front drew in so
that's why we're using a very advanced
design where it's going to be high rpm
it's got two sets of blades which are
spinning in opposite directions counter
rotation because if you actually spin
the blades in the same direction you
don't get any additional benefit so
those are going to be very high static
pressure very high airflow fans and
extremely loud I think we've talked a
lot about the features of the case in
general let's talk about why you'd
actually buy one if you have a ton of
storage space and you don't you're not
content with just a simple mess then you
can buy one of these you don't have to
run all 24 drives it actually got to you
cases 3u cases and other 4u cases that
take fewer drives and not all of the
cases they have have the SFF 8087
connector so many of them including the
I believe it's the 40 20 although I may
be wrong that one I believe uses simple
SATA 2 connectors so you could run SAS
drives SATA 2 drives you could just take
a standard desktop motherboard fill it
up with PCI 4 port SATA cards and then
run them two drives and I mean if you're
not running a high-end raid array if
you're just running like a Windows Home
Server or something like that that kind
of setup could be perfect versus
spending a ton of money on like a more
expensive rack-mountable case or trying
to find a desktop case that's really
going to hold an appropriate number of
drives because I believe the 40:20 holds
twenty drives
now if you are doing something high-end
you can take this case and you can turn
it into something really file server
worthy with just a red card so this is
about a $1,500 red card this is my Rika
arc 1680 IX 24 so if you wanted to use
this particular case to its full
potential meaning you're running 24
drives in raid 6 or hopefully not raid 5
if you got 24 drives or if you're
running several arrays in varying levels
of raid this is exactly the kind of
thing you'd want to use so you go ahead
you put like a nice reliable motherboard
in there or maybe you buy a cheap cheap
tie an or Supermicro board you go ahead
and throw a card like this in there and
there are your six 8087 connectors you
can actually run up to 24 drives off a
card like this so for 2 grand you can
have the case and the card all you need
to do is throw in some value priced
hardware for all I care I mean if it's
just going to be a file so ever you
don't have to be too worried about that
and you can run basically any hard drive
setup that you could pretty much want in
a case like this so I think that covers
everything I wanted to say about the
4224 from Norco and thank you for
checking out my video blog I will
actually be doing a build in this case
just to show it and for the fun of it I
guess we might see what kind of numbers
we can pull out of 24 hard drives and
raid
six or whatever it is we decide we want
to do so thank you for checking out my
video blog and I hope you've learned
something useful about Norco and their I
mean it sounds expensive but believe me
these are inexpensive rackmill cases oh
one last thing I did want to explain for
our viewers who aren't really up on all
of the server terminology what for you
means for you is for x 1u which is the
height of a rack okay so a 1u rack
mountable case you're using low profile
heat sinks low-power hardware it's going
to be about this thin a to you is like
this a 3u is like this and a for you is
like this so it just means how many
racks plots that one case takes up
