that's my fault
we're only three minutes late I want to
get the thumbnail done so it looks all
pretty on YouTube and stuff when you
guys want to join we're gonna have some
pretty interesting news this week
including literally fire yes someone
early-adopter 220 atti and it caught
fire yeah it's just so it's it's so hot
right now it's just it's lit yeah like
oh my god I might be able to use part of
its functionality soon oh well more on
that actually yeah updates there too and
Amazon is gonna start selling iPhones
and crack down on the resale market only
authorized resellers of Apple devices on
Amazon this is you out that is pretty
huge and it's probably why a police
Elling stuff on Amazon oh yes oh that
was a agreement that get into that Valve
is potentially working on a half-life to
prequel for VR we're going the other
direction not all the way though not all
interestingly yeah
yes yeah anyways roll the intro oh yeah
no we're news for you though you'll see
you
oh wow that actually like was ruffled my
voice a little bit
all right hi there we go hey how are you
doing last week you were in the USN day
I was gone I was in Chicago what are you
doing there
you know you hear like kind of scary
things about Chicago windy lots of
talking off the win lots of gun crime
and stuff okay a really nice City it's
beautiful I really that's got the guns
like hell let me get the door for you
yeah it would have been delightful um
anyways yeah good how are you yeah I'm
good I was in you a Sunday also oh oh
yeah yeah we went to LA how was that it
was fun we talked to the YouTube people
and we ripped around on those little
scoot scoot so those lime scooters mmm
it's like the uber uber uber they should
have called it Scooby definitely should
probably I bet you burn needs to make a
scooter today probably already yeah I
should I don't they have a scooter thing
or they invested in an abandoned it's
been in the headlines I haven't
neglected to click I'm not a clue but
they're sweet and they're pretty cheap
and fast and sometimes people double on
the mess I double dead it's pretty fun
oh okay okay for some reason my
immediate imagination went to one foot
on each just flying wait two scooters
yeah and you're slow I thought okay
that's weird I thought you're gonna say
someone riding on the handlebars Oh
which is where you skip that would be
really hard yeah really hard you got to
be a very small person you gotta lean
back keep the weight on that back wheel
yeah any case that that's all ridiculous
speaking of keeping weight on the back
wheel 20 atti has caught fire this was
supposed to my tech dreamer on the forum
a hard OCP user claims to have been
browsing the web like not even pushing
it hard no you might have had GPU
activated browsing but like that's
that's very very low so like it well it
wasn't necessarily at zero but like it
was very very low he was folding at home
maybe maybe that's true fully on home
heck yeah check it on the forum yeah
we're doing that this month everybody
get on it yeah are you doing that by the
way I'm not currently at home
I can't you have a computer I've barely
been at home yeah but the thing with
folding at home is you just set it and
forget it
yes I haven't had time to set it it
takes two second and I'm a new but
actually the setups he's gonna get on
there guys I will get on there and you
should too it's a very conflicting
situation because my computer is a work
computer so I would like need to get
that approved okay I think okay look
like last week or the week before Jake
got on there and I think he did it with
our computer okay but like you're using
home electricity yes so like yeah your
miling out the components a bit but if
you don't run them that hog like that
shouldn't be that bad and it's your
electricity you're paying for so it's
not like you're costing the company
money
yeah so I think you're good but as long
as he's okay with the burnout which
there again there shouldn't be much as
long as they're not hot yeah do medium
I'm only running on medium how much how
hard does medium hit it just so because
there's probably some people in the
audience that are interested in helping
I think on my system I would how hard do
you like 70s yeah okay so that's not bad
so like comes on high I was like in the
high 80s I was like yeah that's maybe
not great yeah because it's long you can
also under volt a little bit I'm not
doing that okay I hit this little slider
but if you're if you're worried about
the longevity of your card actually a
lot of cards can be under volted and
overclocked and it's still fine so you
can you can check that out see if you
can do that and go from medium or maybe
even load whatever just make sure your
card isn't getting super hot and you're
probably okay if you don't know we're
talking about you can lend your computer
to help research really cool causes like
alzheimer's research and stuff like that
and it doesn't take any effort from you
it's great so check it out there's a big
thing all month we're doing it but
anyway this guy might've been doing that
if you if you do it for the month I mean
you're like this is really cool but I
want to do other stuff as well you could
check out that same forum on our forum
the same forum section and there should
be information on blink and boink has
like a bunch of different projects you
can join the whole thing is a little bit
more targeted okay point you can more
select kind of what
working on they're both super cool
folding is bigger as far as I know okay
yeah there's a ton of teams there's like
look at the leaderboard there's a team
that's just called team Taiwan I'm like
how many people are on the news alright
everybody we're joining together you're
getting a tax break if you do this
awesome yeah yeah folding at home check
it out
so right I was maybe folding at home but
all we know he's browsing the web he's
not maxing on his card he's not gaming
the cards not overclocked as far as we
know he doesn't have a faulty CPU or I
mean PSU power supply and something his
computer just unexpectedly shuts down he
goes to investigate by looking through
the side panel and there's fire shooting
out the back of his card oh my goodness
yeah it's much fun
that's not fun we've had a lot of
reports and I know gamers Nexus is
looking into this I again I've been on
my computer a ton I'm not sure if
they've finished their investigation but
I know they've been looking they've been
collecting dead 1080 eyes yeah I'm
trying to figure out why they died how
they died stuff like that I think this
is the only straight-up fire fight
that's what I was gonna say is this is
the only one I've heard of that's fire I
know a lot of them have died I don't
think a lot of them have like
catastrophic Lee gone out and got on
flame in flames yeah so this is this
one's a little bit more spectacular than
than most we've we've ran into do you
have any idea of whether or not this
would be covered by warranty oh I would
hope I think it would be because I've
seen some posts saying all this that's
kind of stuff normally not covered and
I've seen counter post saying no no I
had a similar thing happen to me when my
GP went up in flames oh boy and there's
an MSI one they got covered and then
there's also some questions as you might
look into like like were you'd super
aggressively overclocking it if he
changed the BIOS on here I'm sure he's
screwed do you think it's an EVGA
warranty thing or is it and it would go
back it would go back to EVGA and then I
guess you'd have to see what EVGA
thought about it but it's not the chip
it's the board right and like what kind
of a
is it it's a TI XC sounds like it's
probably a EVGA related problem ooh I'm
going to guess because if that's not a
reference board that might be something
that EVGA did I have no idea I'm talking
on my butt right now
it's but talk yeah but you know yeah
I'm not I'm not super familiar with this
individual card but if that's a non
reference board and that is a non
reference part of the non reference
board then yeah I would contact EVGA
honestly I've had very few computer
components fail on me and this wasn't
even a case where a computer component
failed
I just called EVGA freaked out is a long
story so we're not gonna go into it I've
talked about my morning show before but
their customer service was freakin
wonderful so I'm sure the student taking
growth should be okay cool you were
talking about other details I was like
you're saying he was like there or
something who was where the kid was
there oh yeah there was in his original
thread here he says that he was a little
freaked out because his child was like
nearby physically close to what's
happening so scared the bleep out of me
since my kid was right around it when it
started to shoot flame haven't tried to
turn the PC back on yeah okay that's
probably a decent idea
so apparently everything was in its
stock form so I'm going to assume he
never even opened it before what we're
talking about
okay he said I was just doing some web
browsing wasn't even doing anything else
at the time so he probably wasn't
folding he probably wasn't playing a
game in the background whatever
everything in its stock form never even
opened it before is it a prebuilt hmm
are there even pre volts I have 20 ATT
eyes in them right now I well I'm sure
you could get something from like main
gear origin any of those guys
was chatting the card itself i hain't
opened it he's kind of like he never
opened it up but like yes it's a weird
thing to say segue segue speaking of
weird things or things that also are
smoldering in fire there's a new
agreement between Amazon and Apple where
shoppers will soon see a selection of
the latest Apple products on amazon.com
now correct me if I'm wrong but
historically
you can only buy iPhones from Apple like
apple.com or Apple stores or Apple like
or like if you're gonna go to like
t-mobile the ask style stories so so
yeah okay that's an interesting one yeah
if you go to a cell phone like a
cellular provider yeah they have it but
Best Buy's would have like Apple
sections of their stores it would
usually be an Apple representative there
even though you could be for online
sales was it always just Apple Doc mom
okay honestly not enough of a Mac fanboy
to care so I never knew many sure but
yeah as far as I know anyway you'll be
able to buy them now on Amazon and this
has some serious implications pretty
especially for the resale for like the
refurbished ones so okay let's just go
through this year currently many Apple
products are only available on Amazon
through third-party resellers and their
prices and conditions vary wildly and
that's not apples way sorry so one of
the things like he paid for you paid for
special effects and he got them they're
talking with the guy what is the best
version of art it could ever ask for
the lighting off of that fire was
probably perfect yo yeah there are
elections on the tempered-glass yeah
hyperreal I could feel it yeah sorry
sorry Q PI Apple likes to control all
the products right that's why they have
authorized resellers never yeah they
don't want you to go on eBay and buy a
random like that no conditions that are
they don't want you buying them from
other people they don't want you
repairing them etc it's that they want
to control the pipeline as much as
possible so now currently today there
are
resellers there's all sorts of people on
Amazon Marketplace that are selling
different Apple products in various
conditions but that will not be the case
going forward because the deal will
limit resellers of Apple and Beats
products to those authorized by Apple
independent sellers of Apple products
will have their look their listings that
may be online right now removed after
January 4 2019
that's pretty soon yeah that's
potentially ripping an entire business
that would be your livelihood oh yeah it
is for lots of lots of different sellers
they were all emailed they got an email
from Amazon saying that this is the case
and the only the only recourse they have
is that well you can apply to Apple to
become one of their verified resellers
like that's gonna happen well yeah I
know maybe for a very small minority so
the reason this is weird though is
because there's something in the u.s.
that's called first sale doctrine so the
United States Supreme Court has ruled
that people who legally owned a product
may legally resell it and federal law
protects the right that right under
something known as a first sale doctrine
and in quotes from that doctrine is an
individual who knowingly purchases a
copy of a copyrighted work from the
copyright holder receives the right to
sell display or otherwise dispose of
that particular individual car don't
think that has anything to do with this
though it does though cuz listen okay so
Apple can't control that you know they
can't just have their normal authorized
resellers they can't control the
secondary market because once you own a
thing yourself you can sell it as you
want but if one of the biggest resale
markets in the world is amazon.com and
if Apple enters an agreement with Amazon
whereby all the Apple products sold on
Amazon have to adhere to the deal that
they strike thereby they can circumvent
it absolutely yes technically I believe
that's legal what would have to happen
here as far as I know is it would have
to be shown that Amazon is effectively a
monopoly of online sales for them to to
be able to cover that because right now
it's an individual company being like we
don't want to use those people that's
completely fine you can decide that
people aren't allowed to sell through
your platform that's they're allowed to
do that now okay
I'm not saying I necessarily agree with
any of this stuff or disagree that I'm
just saying right now that law won't
really affect us because an individual
is still completely allowed to sell that
thing just they just won't and Amazon
does what's the percentage of online
sales that's Amazon probably like this
is seventy or something in it for the
u.s. yes like over ten percent of retail
in general I think at this point Wow but
it's it's huge this does apply though to
their global all the global reach of
Amazon so that's France Germany UK US
Italy Spain Japan and India I don't see
Canada on that list interestingly the
other thing that's weird is or I guess
expected is that home pod is not gonna
be sold on Amazon because there's a
competitor yeah cuz they don't because
they have the Amazon echo they also
don't sell the Google of Google home
yeah and so I guess there was another
spat that I didn't know about between
Apple and Amazon where yeah so until
last year you couldn't get apple TV on
Amazon and so because Apple wanted
Amazon to sell the TV but in turn Amazon
wanted the app for Amazon Prime video to
appear on the Apple TV and then Apple
didn't want that so they so the Apple TV
was for sale on Amazon but then it got
pulled because Bezos said that his
reasoning was like if you're buying an
Apple TV on Amazon the customer it's
reasonable for a customer to expect that
Amazon's properties Amazon's video is
gonna be included on this product that
you bought from Amazon and when that's
not happening the user could be
disappointed I'm not sure if I totally
buy that argument but it's reasonable
that was the rationale there they got
past that though so then today you can
buy Apple TVs on Amazon and Amazon Prime
video is on them similar to the spat
that they had between having YouTube on
Amazon was on echoes on the echo show
having YouTube on you chose between
Amazon Google someone in chat is saying
that rule 12 whatever that means
of us trade law so I guess that's what
that means
also prevents contracts from limiting
third party sale as well that sounds
extremely vague and not all-inclusive
and I'm sure there's more to that law
and I'm sure there's other laws that
deal with that law we don't know all of
American law no I don't but presumably
this deal was made by lawyers yeah on
both sides they probably know what's
going they probably know what that check
I knows yeah and that appears to be
going through yeah I wonder with your
point about them being a monopoly I
wonder if it's relative to online like
they're a monopoly on the line or is it
just broadly in in general monopoly law
has not been used as much as it used to
be used it used to be a lot more active
in terms of crushing monopolies and stop
him from Napoles from happening but for
quite a few years now they've been
pretty passive about that stuff so not
only am I not sure but I don't necessary
know that they would step in anyways and
then there's another layer of analysis
or whatever where it's like are the
monopoly of specifically selling Apple
products well I guess that's not even a
consideration because Apple hasn't been
up and selling Apple products is it
every individual business so and this
actually increases the competition there
I wonder also if they're getting a
bigger if Apple pays less to Amazon for
each sale than other products they're
like look normally they're getting it
directly right they don't have to pay
out any middlemen at all interesting I
don't know I know absolutely special
deals going on I just don't I I can't
imagine what they necessarily are
whether it's like you're you're saving
on logistics or like maybe all the
shipping and handling is going to be
handled by Apple instead of Amazon I
would imagine that they're gonna have
fulfillment advantages when it launches
being able to get it in one day rather
than you know i pre-ordered it I'm
getting mine first but I have to wait
and tell them they all reach me Amazon
is really good at getting things to you
fast so there'll be some synergies for
sure yeah people are bringing up law
stuff we are not claiming to know
stuff someone's saying they're not a
monopoly cuz they're in the
international market but but yeah I have
no idea sounds good though I guess this
will be something that we watch unfold
over the next little while we'll see
what happens when I guess on January 4th
it'll be interesting yeah that's when
the other ones I get pulled for sure
another interesting thing rumor time
valve working on half-life 2 prequel for
VR half-life BR yeah it's been VR has
been interesting for a little while now
because I used to I used to make videos
every once in a while I think I made two
in total talking about how VR is like
kind of dying at least in terms of its
its current hype not in terms of VR is
like dying with a killing blow I mean
they're dying in terms of they're going
down it's like no currency hated me for
that it's like much it's the future but
just stop talking about because it's
like it's the future right now you're a
92 yeah yeah so and people hated me for
that pretty hardcore both times and I
was like guys and it's still yeah but
you have to do it so you're like it's
like a self-fulfilling process it was
bad it was I was a bad person for doing
that but one thing that I held on at
that time and I still hold on now is
there certain companies in the space
that are gonna make sure they keep on
pushing forward which is exactly what we
need
Bethesda well they're they're not always
in everyone's good graces seem to be
holding up that trumpet for VR and just
keep pushing keep announcing more games
in VR valve keeps on pushing it's good
this kind of stuff is really awesome to
hear I don't necessarily think this is
gonna like be the the winning ticket
that's gonna make everyone buy a VR
headset and like continue to consume VR
content because that seems to be
actually the biggest problem is people
buy headsets and then lose interest
pretty quick well everyone calm down I
know you like your headset I'm just
saying a lot of people well hold your
horses because this could come out in a
decade that we have no idea very witness
will come out so it could be the case
that
it comes out it's right on somewhat epic
wave and the momentum just goes and goes
well valve time is very real yeah so
this could be this could be forever away
but yeah they're reportedly working on
their own virtual why yeah hooray
they're reportedly working on their own
virtual reality titles to fully and take
advantage of upcoming hardware like the
knuckles controllers which are cool
including a new half-life game but not
three according to a valve news network
Valve's own VR headset is deep in
development and when it eventually
launches it will be bundled with a game
probably this one that game is rumored
to be half-life VR story and it's said
to be a prequel to the events of
half-life 2 now prequel the half-life 2
is not half-life 1 I guess is half-life
1.5 so I guess like the Gateway to the
other dimensions open but the combine
haven't fully taken over earth yet which
they did in like 7 hours so somewhere in
there yeah maybe the whole game takes
place over that 7 hours maybe I don't
know if it's gonna be apparently a first
pour maybe it's uh okay yeah so how do
you walk around there's multiple
different ways you could do that how do
you think they'll do it most I want to
be surprised of whose teleportation
personally I actually prefer
teleportation over like shortwave
teleported have you played Duke we argue
no so basically you get your controller
and you have like an arc that you can
shoot out and it'll put a spot on the
ground yeah teleported like that and
different VR things yeah I personally
prefer that over joystick movement
turistic movement starts to like that's
too much yeah I would prefer to teleport
and then be able to physically move
within whatever my bounds are within my
newly teleported space is that how doom
does it yeah what we'll have to see the
movement in VR is gonna be a problem for
a while I have no clue how they'll solve
it someone will solve it and then it
will be glorious movement and full-body
immersion it just seems that even if and
when they saw that stuff it's gonna be
such a high barrier to entry it's gonna
oh yeah like I'm not even buying the
our Matt well we fix like ah that's a
whole other couple hundred dollar thing
yeah well not not even that not even
very likely upgrading your computer I
know not necessarily for a lot of people
in this audience but for most people
upgrading or getting a computer in the
first place then having the space for it
then the headset itself is really
expensive really really expensive and
even if it wasn't there was actually a
really interesting blog post by Palmer
Luckey
recently I know he's fairly
controversial in a few different ways
but if you ignore all of that and just
read the blog post it's very interesting
I would highly recommend it it where he
talks about even if VR headsets were
zero dollars it wasn't that one called
like free is not cheap enough yeah right
and it's it's I very much stand behind a
lot of the points that he brings up it's
it's right now VR is super cool there's
a lot of really good experiences you can
have in VR what is that I always forget
the name of games
I'm saber o beat saber is super fun
really really cool idea what do you do
you have light sabers essentially and
you have to hit these blocks but you
have to hit them in the right direction
okay so it brings in a lot of movement
you're sort of dancing and music playing
it's it's a really good way to get you
engaged I know
Linus plays what I believe is called box
VR where he literally just boxing and he
has a lot of fun with it a lot of people
can find something that they really
enjoy he's a lot of very cool
experiences in PR but most of them are
really cool for a very confined amount
of time they don't keep you on a headset
and getting the headset on most people
don't want to wear this big clunky thing
on their head the controller's a little
wacky there's a lot of problems with VR
disconnections a lot of people feel a
little bit sick still that is still a
problem
I know it's massively reduced from the
past but that is still a problem it's
interesting because there's a lot of
factors here where you're you just hear
well we should bring back arcades this
is conducive to arcades but then there's
other things that aren't like the space
and like Real Estate's really expensive
you know if you're gonna have a business
that is predicated on people coming in
and playing VR you're gonna need a few
setups and each setup needs a pretty big
space and eye herpes and eye herpes
nobody wants to wear another mask and
sweat on your face like it's it's no
there's there's a lot of problems with
VR right now there's a lot of
surmountable problems so that's a good
spot to be in yeah there's definitely a
very strong very strong future for VR
very strong future for AR all right very
strong future for eye herpes yeah okay
careful when you're sharing your
headsets give people the clean the lens
off that's a thing by the way Google at
your own and as far as we know no one
contracted eye Herbie's at the last LTX
know a little wipes on site no reported
cases yeah that a super check or is that
just a tag the pink one it's gone in the
chat though that's just cause someone's
doing at - tech and twitch chat oh
that's a highlights it would think okay
it makes it easier for broadcasters to
see when people are talking directly to
them instead of people are talking more
system that's useful it's a super traps
get highlighted in hell don't they yes
this is also twitch they don't have know
we get on a twitch to hear oh here we go
I think we read those at the and have
you heard of magically yeah yeah I've
heard of magically let's do ad spots
really quick let's jump in boss
organizer well put up any one of those
I'm gonna give you this one I like this
one better one thing I really really
like about that one that I bring up
every single time they sponsor the show
and I think it's the same with all their
bags yes it is really bright orange
inside I haven't even read what I'm
supposed to say yet I just want to bring
this up super bright reflective orange
insides really cool it looks even more
contrasting black at the bottom here you
can see the bottom every bag should have
that yes yeah it's amazing there's no
more like oh I can't find this like
black pen in the bottom my bag cuz my
bullet the entire inside of my bag is
all black and I can't see blacking it's
black very well so even have the the
black pack but on the inside it's bright
orange so you can find things really
easily I love it it's so wonderful and
it's like slightly reflective so it
bounces light around really nicely so
you can eat things see things really
well anyways here's the animal put an
lzt logo on that it would toll
mash the color scheme just saying we
should get patches that people can sew
on stuff we should just get a bag the
moss
we should we should take this offline
but I love that idea I mean I think of a
clever name that puts it yeah Moss Moss
tips I don't know whatever Moss
organizer keeps you protected and
organized by making simple products with
really cool features I'm heading that
little bit in myself
the moss backpacks are great for
traveling to and from work or
internationally while keeping all your
electronics safe Moss packing grande
this is the black pack is this grande it
looks bigger
it does look bigger I'm not sure though
but moss pack grande fits up to 17 inch
laptop this looks like it would fit some
teachers laptop I'm not sure the black
pack fits laptops up to fifteen point
six inches made of sixteen ATD ballistic
nylon it feels pretty bullets that's the
cool to be honest that makes it tear and
abrasion resistant yeah feels like
Morgan Freeman that sucker will stop a
knife zippers are good too they feel
like it one thing that I don't like
about a lot of zippers is when they'll
get stuck to the side you know what I
mean I mean you have to like mess with
it and readjust it so you can get it in
line so you can pull it properly I have
that problem on some rain shells yeah or
I have to like go like this sideways and
stuff yeah oh I mean like when you're
trying to zip it up and it gets stuck
sideways oh yeah and you have to like
rotate it around and get it to these
don't have that problem at all happen I
love it it's great the built-in rain fly
on the black pack provides extra padding
for your electronics when not in use it
comes out of the bottom Oh
so if you like clunk your bag down and
you're not a 12-ounce on the otherwise
so I used to use a cover for my backpack
when I was going to school because I
wouldn't your shopping bag yeah so it
was much less elegant but these are
actually really smart
I used to bike to school so a lot of
rain would
wake up on to my bag and my what I
believe was a garbage bag would keep it
clean but I'd have to keep swapping out
because it was a freaking garbage bag so

just wanted to practice that looks so
professional even in the placement of
the signature knee yeah it looks like it
could have been like printed on there
anyways I don't think it is so you're
interested and if you're watching on
YouTube later for the vaad there will be
a link in the description for Amazon

easy did you do oh yeah here's a pretty
easy link lmg dot g g /c sonic prime
boom plus you get this bag dude the bags
actually really nice because then you
throw your spare cables in the bag oh no
dude then you never get to use the bag
transporting alcohol in public and style
oh well is that Crown Royal no it's it's
absolute but it's new folding phone
details folding phones the folding
screen the galaxy F are you interested
I'm interested most people think it's
not cool I think it's super oh I totally
want to check that puppy oh yeah I
remember the last CES we went to there
was a ZTE holding phone and I thought
that's probably junk but we checked it
out and it was way lighter than I
thought and when I opened it it was
pretty cool that one has a seam it's
actually just two screens yeah and
there's a hinge right it was pretty good
but this will be next level I think this
is gonna be a real trendsetter I
wouldn't be surprised of Apple well they
don't want to cannibalize their iPads
but I think this is an amazing product
it's got quite a kind of thick boy bezel
going on okay so the and just the
general bezel around the screen bezel
really see that again really that's a
pretty that's like a quarter inch or
like a half inch top a big boy I do I do
know when they were showing this off
they like dimmed the lights and as far
as I know the the body that it's in
itself is not final that's right see the
silhouette it was like a brick yeah yeah
I'm gonna be willing to make trade-offs
like that yeah it'll be interesting and
no iterate on it like that looks you
know it's pretty thick like if it's like
a full
phone of thickness on each side carrying
two phones in your pocket all the time
what if it's like that thick it's pretty
thick look at that I mean people have
done it like we did it dude I've carried
multiple phones all the time
we're like in high school when you had a
flip phone they were just different
dimensions
yeah usually they were really short
though the real question is is there is
there any use when it's open and you're
actually using that beautiful big screen
do you care does it offer you any value
that looks really big
that mock-up in that person's hand looks
really big I know what that looks like
that looks like the size of my wife's
note 8 in a giant wallet case that she
has okay yeah but then that's it folded
so then it's like a book I I think
there's use because personally if I'm
let's look at the pixel 3 for instance
pixel 3 is small small for me yeah one
hand I can type on it just fine but I
like typing with two hands when I can
yeah and I can type with one hand on a
pixel 3xl it's a little bit of a stretch
but I can do it just fine do all the
time but if I had like a big nice screen
and I was to hand typing sure I don't
know man cuz do you ever turn your try
typing on landscape yeah it's gonna be
like this wide that's not fine for me
it's annoying yeah it's like you gotta
you can't just think it's gonna do you
can't just let your thumbs go you have
to like tilt your hand to get to the
middle yeah yeah but you're a thick boy
- was here you'd have to like take his
hand off to get to them but that's the
thing that's where like I think some of
the smaller phone form factors it's kind
of sad that they're going away
because sometimes it's nice that like
for my daily driver I like bigger phones
generally but sometimes it's nice to
have a little phone yeah I want the
pixel three the small one yeah cuz I do
a lot of one-handed yeah and I I don't
have one of those things on the back the
rings that you put your finger soo
family is a godsend it makes you know
like makes your big phone one handable
yeah I've tried him out but I've never
had it one myself
apparently I love it if I get it I don't
girlfriend
one of those she loves it but I just
yeah I don't know I I think I think okay
but in this situation yeah see it's
weird cause like that's it he's doing
like this like that actually looks
pretty small it does not look the same
in this photo where he's actually
holding it that's that's close so that's
a back that's that's a this one it's
close to and in this one it looks like
it's huge but then when he's actually
home a rendering though that's true and
this is the and that chassis is like not
the chassis so it'll probably even be
smaller than that I would think so and
probably has different different bevels
and champers and stuff so what do you
think about using Matt generally and
then opening it up what do you even want
to because if you open up he can't like
the message basically everything I do on
my freakin phone is messaging of some
sort okay now so this is a second screen
right
whenever you when it's closed there's a
secondary screen that you can use and
that screen alone is I think like 4.7
inches or something like that which is
like pretty big yeah that's I don't even
know why they really have that I mean
cuz there are some phone cases for
regular phones that when you close them
there's a little window
yeah and they work with the phone
software to have like notifications and
you have clock in that little window and
I think that would be sufficient this is
just like so much more than like at some
point why even open it I think that's
the idea because with this screen yeah
that's a lot of screen isn't it geez
with in terms of the battery drain idea
I mean it's only it's OLED so it'll turn
off be completely off yeah I'd be scared
about breaking it more than the battery
but with this screen if you need to one
hand you can really easily
don't lose that functionality I don't
know I really don't know if I buy it who
do you think are interesting you think
it's like kind of like the BlackBerry
market those people who actually want to
run a spreadsheet dude I think it's
gonna be massive in Korea Korea has crew
and like I'm not surprised Samsung's
making it Korea has always loved
gigantic phones mmm absolutely monstrous
sized phones and like
was really the first time I was in Korea
you see people with like TV antennas off
their phones yeah yeah they had a whole
different broadcasting yeah yeah but
like but like huge format phones were
massive there can we go back to because
what about you know people are streaming
more and more of their devices
what about content consumption if you
turn that puppy sideways what aspect
ratio is that like four by three or
something I don't know like you're gonna
get something you're gonna get some
black bars one thing I really like about
this open format though is split screen
stuff yeah which was really cool in the
ZTE one that we tried yeah it's there's
a lot of cases that it's useful to have
like your calendar open and your email
or something like if I can be messaging
and like almost let's say almost like
separate desktop style it split screen a
little bit more aggressive than they
currently have because if you know like
the floating give Facebook message or on
your fly have you had bad heads yeah I
hate those if you have chat heads open I
understand that you hate them but if you
have them open and when you expand it it
doesn't fill your whole screen it just
fills up like the messaging portion of
your screen
yeah you can be watching a video and be
doing email and have the chat had
annoying you all the time and and like
it that sounds very cool for
productivity be able to watch or observe
something it kind of screws YouTube I
you need to have the premium YouTube in
order to be watching a video and
minimize the app and do other things on
your phone with this you just keep it
open
although the YouTube app doesn't support
split screen right so what do you have
to support split screen for you to be
able to I said I almost want to be a
better version where it's like multi
desktop like separated I think that's
yeah I don't think it's the same as
actual Android split screen if I
remember the ZTE one they have the
buttons along the bottom to choose what
you want it so one button was like put
my whole thing as one screen one button
was make it a and B yeah cuz was with
like an A and B set up YouTube might not
be able to say no yeah because I don't
think it's actually the same as Android
split screen and then they had a third
button that was a and a and because with
that phone you could put it in like tent
mode so you
I could put it here and you could watch
it and I could watch it kind of an edge
case weird
let's watch this together but from
really far away it's just like you don't
have to go like this to watch a video we
can just like here check on this video I
can hold my phone like that and we're
both watching it sure his eyes are
smiling he likes this part does he like
this music video I can feel his breath I
mean that's useful like on a train or
something right sure
yeah I could see people doing it it's
just not how to preserve my thing anyway
okay no but the new things were that
it's called F which is not that sexy no
yo is that the F good enough Brooke
sounds kinda like ass but it's less cool
f bomb yeah and the other new thing is
the price whoa I had not looked at that
yet Oh God - phone $1,770 ah I get it
I'm not gonna buy it
I understand the price I understand why
it has to be that expensive we got so
many screens the thing's huge you're
gonna need a our answers the Rd like
yeah I'm working on this for you they're
not gonna sell that many of them it's
such a premium device yes it's I get it
butthole it's amazing that they're like
beating Apple in their own game in a way
I love how some people in in chat have
started saying F for the price so like
respects so it's like that pay respects
for this phone called an F I want to
riff on this Apple angle though it's
interesting because right now you're
seeing smart phones flatten out it's a
mature market yes everyone in the dogs
making them yeah when a new category
gets kind of forged by the innovator
usually having a vertically integrated
product gives you an advantage because
when your company is handling all the
different parts of it then you get this
kind of performance Delta that you
benefit from and that's what i thought
svenne affiliate from for years and
they're losing that performance Delta
now as as the product gets commoditized
and yet now you're seeing Samsung which
actually is also a vertically integrated
phone company in ways different
Apple Apple has the hardware and
software integration samsung has has a
hardware integration across the stack
like they make the screens they make all
these other components they make more of
their phones components than any other
cell phone maker out there as far as I
know and so it's a different type of
vertical integration and in this case
it's still in 2018 giving them a
performance Delta where they're the ones
who get to actually innovate not by just
like removing headphone jacks and
actually put out this this crazy
perhaps revolutionary or at least
evolutionary product which is pretty
cool and they're also beating Apple in
there in own game insofar as finding a
way to charge a but ton of money for a
phone yeah whereas like with Apple
they've kind of got all the Apple
customers in the world that exist and
now they're just trying to squeeze more
money a per customer and by pushing the
price up to $1,500 for the new 10s at
almost 2 grand that's that's gonna be
more than like a not not a majority at
all but a significant notable percentage
of the amount of people watching this
show it'll be more than their first car
definitely more than the desktop 7 a lot
of its 70 US dollars yeah like I think
that's know that's about the global
monthly income the global average
monthly income yeah so that's crazy
okay put it this way though if you're
gonna get the most expensive iPhone 10s
Mac's 256 gigabyte version it's like
fifteen hundred and fifty dollars would
you spend an extra hundred or two
hundred dollars to get this I wouldn't
get a max so it's like a bit of a
difficult question but I understand
where you're coming from and maybe I
also think it might have a really good
space not that this space is even going
to necessarily be around for all that
long but if you gave this phone to
someone who had like who was who did not
grow up with phones and was somewhat
vision impaired by a little bit the like
expanded icon version on this phone is
gonna be awesome okay you take this
thing on your pocket you unfold it and
you just have this huge screen if you
need to Peck type it's gonna be easy I
think there's give me certain
demographics that love this phone I
think there's a lot of people in the
world where their phone is their
computer yeah I think there's business
people like they're gonna have like the
BlackBerry market like every real estate
agent is gonna have this phone because
they like to flex and because you know
they got to open up their day planner
and it'd be awesome to have your
calendar open that big yeah drew I can't
read the rest of your name because it
blends in with the pinkish hue of that
message really aggressively
yeah I'm not I wouldn't get a max
largely because I don't like Samsung
software
he was like would would get a max but
wouldn't buy or but is interested in a
pixel three XL first of all not really
people three excels are kind of a
disaster
I think all phones right now our little
derp but yeah I'm sitting on an original
L XL XL Wow with like a cracked screen
and a basically fried out battery and I
just don't think this thing's gonna have
junk battery life on the one hand it's
pretty big maybe has two batteries on
the other hand it has three big screams
put there oh that's they can turn off
yeah if you have two batteries and you
usually just use the one screen like you
could drag that battery out for a long
time of it cool although I think you'll
notice a significant decrease in battery
oh yeah start unfolding it very often
yeah yeah that's gonna be pretty I hope
it has a satisfying click when you open
it yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what's all
that or what if you put a ring on the
back of it and you can just take it out
of your pocket with one hand equal
finish well yeah honestly that would
sound so if you're watching if Samsung's
watching change is that good that's your
ad right there that's your commercial be
like Zorro that's zero that's your
unlock was so sweet RTX in battlefield
five finally you'll be able to use your
thingamajiggy in the first pup unless
you're got scarred lit on fire if it's
not ashes you can finally play
available official title with r-tx on
paired with g-force for 16.9 for wickel
drivers Windows 10 1809 and patch
battlefield 5 you haven't heard that
yeah you'll be in for a surprise the
performance drops roughly 50% hey man
whatever man
it costs a lot to look this good we got
some actual frame a frame rate numbers
oh my god so there's a link if you click
through to the the second source you can
actually see some screens Oh what am i
selling bug that prevented them from
testing a medium sure no okay yeah
apparently what happened was the when
they tried to set it to medium it would
actually just keep the settings from the
last one they were on so if they went
from low to medium it would show they
were just running low and if they went
from high to meet him he would run it
high oh ok so if they were running with
the ray tracing off with their at 1080p
with their 20 atti
which I can tell you I've played a bit
of battlefield 5 looks beautiful well it
can look more beautiful if you don't
want 150 8.8 frames per second and
you're like hey I'll take 65 that's a 20
atti
and a 1080p screen unless you're going
for a crazy high refresh rate at which
point in time you're not turning on r-tx
or you're not turning on ray tracing
actually say more specifically yeah well
you can you can run in 4k at 30fps hey
man that used to be enough oh really
actually if you go really far back in
gaming like original I think there's
Mario Kart and stuff is still 60 but you
could do 4k with r-tx on low or DXL the
XR on low or a medium it provided medium
works because they have given us levels
you can do off low medium high and ultra
and so
4k Ultra is 30fps is that right that's
right so turning on ray tracing at all
you get a no matter what level you get a
huge reduction they should have shown us
yeah I want more stuff than this I'll
order that go to here there's ten stuff
is there more yeah they did if there's a
full I'm right there yeah just touch it
got the touch this is the visuals if you
go to the bottom okay hold on hold on
expansive those it looks cool they're
not the same screenshots no this is all
this this isn't a side-by-side
comparison this is just all on okay good
but if you go to the bottom there's a
table of contents thing you can go to
performance insight maybe Oh what though
I think it's ultra and low yeah there's
not that much of a difference between
low and ultra so if you gonna draw
that's ultra so if you're looking at the
reflection and the if you look at the
reflection in the window that reflection
is all still there that's so cool though
with r-tx hey you can't not seen
unrelated things oh no no that's not
true I just didn't see them the first
time so the light on these like little
metal bars show a lot more it's so cool
that you can better you can look through
a window that's transparent and even
though you're looking through and seeing
the environment through the window
you're you're also seeing the reflection
of the stuff behind you that wasn't
possible before and that's so realistic
it's so super cool and you get that
regardless of its lower ultra so I think
a lot of people are end up turning it on
and running it out low it's pretty
awesome how it makes it worse
competitively that's pretty cool I hope
a lot of you guys turn that on so I can
kill you more easily a game memory usage
performance
Ultra ultra ultra where's like scroll
more or at the bottom are its it we look
so if it says ultra up here is that
assuming DX horizontal track no no no
here that means the game is running at
ultra 27 but then it stops deep break
that's because this is off and then it's
getting higher details so where's 20
this is a little well it's all the
different cards right this is what are
you looking for any ultra check up here
I don't see anymore 20 yeah
TI ultra right there medium oh right cuz
the medium was glitched or whatever
right yeah so DX are low what oh that's
2070 they don't have 28 DTI with the XR
low yeah oh it's farther down this way
derp I'm still reading this backwards so
there's 0.5 FPS difference between ultra
and high for DX are at 4k this is 1440
yeah Sony ATI DX are high 52.6 fps so
you'll have to and then medium still
bugs damn it
so it's the the sweet spot above the
sweet spots probably luckily with my
monitor haha 1440p tornado TI DX are on
medium once it actually works
you'll be above 60 fps and you'll still
have the XR on and I guess low is still
pretty nice I will note that there is
actually a pretty major difference I
agree with you if you want those
reflections and stuff just having it on
minimum is it's pretty cool but in those
side-by-sides especially the bars in the
window that actually stood out to me a
lot yeah like if you're just going for
realism that looks that looks nice you
can barely see the bars on the window on
the first one and they really stand out
on the second one whether or not okay to
be completely honest whether or not
that's a good thing whether or not
that's actually realistic I don't know
because if they're black bar
that's how they would look right well
yeah who knows I don't know where
materials with bars are supposed to be
of no way if there's a light directly
shiny on them yeah so we can I can't
really tell I don't know turn it on
during the campaign yeah that sucker on
lo of online yeah and let the frames rip
and like in this situation the gun it
looks different is it supposed to be
that dirty or is it supposed to be shiny
like this I don't know they can both be
fairly realistic I'm not sure but I
would play around with it in
single-player you will be literally
better off turning it off and
multiplayer we've talked about that in
the past and one final thing to wrap up
Stanley died this week guys maybe 95
yeah dad on Monday luckily I will say
like obviously it's sad but we have to
look back on the positive stuff you've
lived a long and very fulfilling life I
think I think what a legend yeah exact
rest and power Stanley exactly what a
legend like it's so crazy when you're a
kid and you're watching let's say you're
watching like a spider-man 90s cartoon
yeah and any of these heroes is is
presented with a dilemma there's a the
right thing to do in the wrong thing to
do and not only these shows kind of kind
of teach kids the idea of what the right
thing to do is but the you watch enough
of these that you're sitting there as a
child and you know what the right thing
to do is and you know that hero's gonna
do that thing it's just so crazy that a
person can take part in creating the
mythology our entire society is nuts
that's the crazy he did that people like
him do that I guess Disney that kind of
stuff does that but um that's just like
the entire imagination of the culture he
lived a long life he impacted more lives
than the vast majority of people ever
like the vast vast majority of people
ever in a positive way and I think he
made a lot of really really really cool
things that will live on for a very long
time speaking of cool things
Netflix added a
where if you're in your search bar you
type in Excel C or with an exclamation
point which is Stanley's catch phrase
used to sign off his articles with that
yeah it will just bring up all the
marble oh no that's cool
search results there your results are
gonna vary depending on the region
you're in but just a little Easter egg
which is pretty cool and I got some
little Stanley facts here okay go okay
did you know that he's been in 16 Marvel
films since the first two thousands
x-men and because he doesn't scammy oh
yeah they're actually in the contract
really there's a contract that
stipulates he has to appear in every
film that's based on the character he
created isn't it awesome that's cool
that's what my favorite one
there's a couple other facts and you
guys can check out oh yeah there's
actually three cameos still to come and
I was also gonna actually ask this
question you know how Star Wars did like
CGI oh yeah yeah passed away what do you
think if they just kept cameo Stanley
honestly kind of cool that would be kind
of cool personally there's a there's an
interview with who is it the person who
took over like the current CEO of Marvel
and he's he apparently visited Stanley
before not like two days before he
passed away and he said that he was he
was still talking about even though he
had like accepted allegedly accepted his
fate he was still talking about doing
future cameos because he just it was
like he loved doing the cameos as long
as didn't have to travel he was like his
like favorite thing to do so I think it
would be kind of cool do you make sense
I feel like it's something he would want
to do I feel like even though he his
body is now gone the the things he
created still live long and I think you
would want to be a part of it personally
and he is gonna appear in Ralph's breaks
the internet the sequel to record elf
he's gonna be in spider-man into the
spot or yeah into the spider verse is
the next movie I guess and he might end
up being in Avengers 4 which is coming
out in May and but going with what
you're talking about he actually is
immortalized in the amazing spider-man
game from I believe 2017 because there's
like some DLC where you can play as
Stanley and you can like web sling
we have that link you can check out on
on YouTube I don't know we don't have it
linked to now you can google it so we do
have a link there it is there's a
YouTube clip speaking of crazy stuff
detective Pikachu
do we want to I don't know there's a
kind of an uncanny valley thing going on
with those Pokemon it's weird it's weird
I don't know if there is a good way to
do this I'm not gonna see this movie
guys you're not gonna see it I'll see it
if the reviews are off the chain but
they're not there it's gonna be junk
it's gonna be okay from the director
though okay some of them some of the
Pokemon are weird that's I think my
biggest problem with it like the what is
it is your mine and the mr. minds hands
that's what that's what I'm saying this
uncanny valley they have like this
realistic skin it's kind of creepy even
even Pikachu's like dude like to
high-res my man but what did you want I
don't think there's a Charmander is like
whoa they look weird or not the charm at
or the Charizard the bolsters like what
that thing's really weird
I think it's an Eevee I'm not even sure
her ninja looks fine to be completely
honest I don't know they should've
gotten a Psyduck that's so weird
Charizard looks good at the end
yeah the mr. monster mimes hands the
rest of it I don't actually bother
see all the like weird like this is
definitely a glove wrinkles oh yeah it's
weird I don't know from the director who
brought you such classics as shark tales
monsters vs. aliens Gulliver's Travels
and goosebumps I mean do you think that
they're consistent at least like what
that looks like that painting the screen
yeah you think that there's consistency
across the different Pokemon do you know
they have our
stick harmony know you think they all
looked like one-offs kind of yeah yeah I
don't know I'm not that into it I don't
know what chat necessarily thinks if
this gets a rotten tomatos of +75
and an IMDB of over seven I'll go so
you're not going a lot of people are
pissed though it's Ryan Ryan Reynolds
they don't think it I don't know they
don't think he fits I think it's okay I
don't care
him being Pikachu yeah I think that's
maybe a little weird I feel like he'd be
better as like Meowth or something big
time Big Time bags me out yeah yeah like
a more playful kind of character Pikachu
was always very I don't know he's a
little more cutesy yeah like very much
so would do a good Pikachu I have no
idea
- someone beloved and maybe a higher
voice I don't know I feel like a higher
voice cuz we're I'm Reynolds is just
Ryan Reynolds in every movie you know
yeah yeah yeah I feel like a higher
voice probably someone with a little bit
less like yeah the Ryan Reynolds style a
little bit I love Ryan Reynolds Ryan if
you're watching this local boy no hate
hell yeah and you're not just Ryan
Reynolds oh I've seen you and evil whore
it was really good you were serious it
was good but I don't think he's Pikachu
I think you could pull off to be honest
quite a few different Pokemon very well
especially the ones that talk like now
yeah I can't think of who would be a
good now if I think is like typecasted
perfectly but there's I think there's a
few others that would play really well
with Ryan Reynolds style game a squirtle
even hell yeah that obscure little squad
leader Ryan Reynolds is so dope deal
with the sunglasses come on those
triangle ones yeah you could pull it off
so well I just I don't personally think
Pikachu was the right decision here yeah
I mean him being in the movie 100%
give me a Pokemon movie where Ryan
Reynolds is the voice of every Pokemon
sit except to be honest that would be
funny in its own right and like other
people are saying Danny DeVito oh that's
brutal but it's funny someone
someone put some Danny DeVito lyrics
with Pikachu and spree funny yeah that's
enough that's it that's it for the show
I hope you liked it if you did come back
next week and then I'm gonna press this
fight oh it's super Chad did anyone even
super chat us
okay so let's go through some of these
firstly I think that ray-tracing is just
a distraction to Moore's law we can't
really increase performance anymore you

clean I don't like TouchWiz thank you

way through memes I saw you guys did

place there's a new elastic
