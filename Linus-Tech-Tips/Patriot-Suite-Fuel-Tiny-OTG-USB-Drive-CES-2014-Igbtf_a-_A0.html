brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital now there are some
similarities between what we're going to
show you here in the Patriot suite at
CES and what we showed you at computex
last year so we showed you the fuel plus
at computex and that's available in a
bunch of different capacities its
external you know on the go power for
your tablets and smartphones okay we've
heard all this before but fuel plus does
actually have a couple of unique
features so number one is that the
higher capacity models have two and a
half empty Arjun ports meaning you can
charge your devices particularly high
draw ones that support it like tablets a
little bit faster than even a 2.1 amp
chart charging port and the second thing
is that they have their power pass
through feature that allows you to
charge not only the fuel plus by
plugging it into the wall but also the
connected devices so you can just plug
the hole swak of things into the wall at
night before you go to sleep and then
it'll all be charged up when you're
ready in the morning now they've updated
fuel plus to add more colors so now we
have blue pink green and yellow in the
several different sizes and capacities
and that goes along with of course the
existing white ID they're also adding
fuel active to the mix so that's
available in a couple of different
configs number one is this little
aluminum job right here that I believe
is a two thousand million power battery
it's got your USB ports on the one side
and has got a Oh a flashlight look at
that on the other side so you can
actually use it to charge your devices
on the go or as an emergency flashlight
if you're camping because you know feel
active obviously the intention is your
active we've also got a rugged one this
is a six thousand million power unit and
it's got an integrated cable so you can
use that one in order to charge a device
or it has a separate two and a half amp
output so the little guy the two
thousand million power doesn't have that
so that's got the high amperage output
it's also got like kind of a ruggedized
case and then last but not least let's
see if I can there's like there's like a
trick I think you have to like double
click it or something oh this one's
probably not charged anyway it has an
entire Bank of LEDs on the one side here
and that one's a dummy as well causing
all kinds of trouble we'll get some
b-roll of that all right next up we've
got something that's completely new this
is the fuel plus iPhone power
okay so it's for the iphone 5 and it
adds about a doubling in terms of
overall battery life to your iPhone
without adding too much extra bulk it's
not something that we've never seen
before but it does have their power pass
through feature which is again a very
useful feature so thanks for checking
out our coverage of the Patriot suite
here at CES 2014 don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips don't miss
any of our coverage and a big thanks to
our sponsors NCIX calm your source for
great technology selection and service
course our memory and last but not least
Western Digital without those guys we
simply couldn't be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
