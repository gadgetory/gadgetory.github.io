our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is to date technology
and our trusted networking partner guys
were hands-on with project shield this
is Nvidia's new handheld gaming system
based on android based on the tiger
processing technology and we are to
showcase what i think on the internets
right now is the biggest buzz about this
particular little gaming console because
we've all got phones at this point that
we carry around and complete games on a
touchscreen but where do you get the
integrated the integrated controller and
where do you get the ability to stream
from a geforce graphics card powered pc
so sorry what was your name again James
it's going to show us how this
technology works with a live demo this
is a you know as a side already pretty
much unprecedented use case the ones
done this before we all have really
powerful pieces at our homes nars PC
gamers anyway and we want to be able to
play that more than just sitting on our
desk so here you'll be able to connect
through this and the picture will be
rendered on your pc and then beamed over
as h.264 video onto the Nvidia shield
and helmet so the interface is actually
very simple you can see you just press
the mid button here and now you can
which pcs you compared to here we have
Jensen's PC our CEOs thank you for
donating that Jensen and we just connect
to it and it says connected now you have
this very very simple interface where
you can select all of your favorite pc
games imagine playing battlefield 3 and
then stay on the couch instead of tied
to your computer desk so we can launch
for example need for speed most wanted
so can I get you to explain something
really quick this cable coming out of
the back of the unit that is not
anything to do with the gaming
experience you're having here on the
screen is that correct CS a lot of Wi-Fi
noise so we make sure we have good good
reception we're just going with ethernet
right okay but we can do this wirelessly
at home that's the intended use case at
home you're going to be using a Wi-Fi
connection and so long as you have a
pretty good router and pretty up-to-date
graphics card you know the latency is
going to be very good so in terms of
ergonomics it's certainly I would
consider it to be sort of a good fit
between being able to put your ring
fingers right up under the handle here
so that you can easily manage it with
smaller hands I think the intended use
is not just the traditional audience of
the hardcore gamers that Nvidia's cater
to but i would expect kids to be using
something like this this will be so much
more powerful that I mean especially
someone like I mean I've got a young kid
I'd much rather get him something like
this where he can leverage the power pcs
PC that I already have in my house I
already bought it why am i buying a game
console that's not going to take
advantage of it right so you know what
you can use it like that but you look at
how long these handles are your hands
are actually significantly bigger than
my own so I'd like you to just hold it
there and show them how you can adjust
your hand backwards on it so that you
can easily reach the controls regardless
of the size of your hands the button
layout is pretty simple so for those of
you who like the SNES controller you're
going to be able to use it just like
that for those of you who like a more
modern controller you can use it with
the dual analog sticks there's a to
shoulder buttons up on each side so
you've got a trigger as well as a
regular shoulder button and a headphone
jack up here we've got it plugged in
using anything that adapter and it looks
like that is is that a power connector
as well so this is running off batteries
that make sure that fracas
ok got it exists oh okay there's an SD
card slot micro HDMI so don't worry guys
it's a lot more elegant than that these
plates on the top are actually
interchangeable so I haven't I have not
whoa can I budget every I'm probably
going the wrong way at this point
so the screen is running a web
resolution 720p so this is an HD gaming
experience and in that makes it pretty
much close to something like a retina
bespoke size retina density speakers are
awesome in fact I can even feel the
vibration of the unit itself in my hands
and vibration is that just the speakers
just the sound that's very very cool so
starting back fighting are integrated
here in this course it is a full
touchscreen as well viewing angles I
want to get you guys to look at that
because you can see looking at the
yellow of the car itself right there and
it's going to turn the volume down gift
us oh there we go turn them that's
pretty intuitive actually see I didn't
know how to do this I want you to see
the yellow of the car as I tilt it away
from you so if you have a friend sitting
next to you they want to look over your
shoulder as is bound to happen with
these kinds of really cool gadgets that
other people want to check out there
going to be able to see it so have I
have we missed anything critical no I
think you've covered it tell me about
the battery life battery life we're
looking about 5 to 10 hours of battery
life playing a android based game but if
you're playing with streaming pc that's
going to last even longer because all
you're doing is decoding video on the
device all the heavy-lifting has been
done on the pc and i think I can speak
for everyone when I say this is
incredibly exciting but I'm actually
even more excited for something like a
gentoo gen 3 gen 5 product where we're
going to be looking at 1080p or even
greater display resolutions we're going
to be looking at the ability to do I
mean this is this is incredible this is
the beginning of a wonderful friendship
alright well thank you very much and a
big thanks to Nvidia for allowing us to
get in here and get hands on with
project shield don't forget to subscribe
to line his tech tips don't miss any of
our videos on CES 2013 and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
