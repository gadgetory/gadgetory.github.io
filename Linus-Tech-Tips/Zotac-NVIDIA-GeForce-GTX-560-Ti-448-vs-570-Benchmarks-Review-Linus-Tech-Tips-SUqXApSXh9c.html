about the all-new gtx 560 TI but this is
other more different slightly more
better gtx 560 TI limited edition 448
core gtx 560 TI that also uses the GF
110 core which is actually the same core
that gets used in the gtx 570 not the
same processing core that gets used in
the original gtx 560 TI so what we're
doing here is we're actually doing a
couple of things we're adding call of
duty modern warfare 3 to the test suite
so i'm showing you guys the benchmark
run that i'll be using so it's two
minutes at the beginning of the game
which is pretty straightforward because
you just fight your way through the
streets this is pretty representative of
the kind of action you're going to see
in this and any other modern warfare
game as far as i can tell they're all
pretty samey
so you know you point the thing at the
thing and then the guy fall down that
kind of that kind of action point the
thing kind of approximately at the thing
and then the guy falls down as far as I
can tell I think that grenade went off
but didn't the animation didn't show so
the guy went flying forward that's
terrific these guys are on my team so in
order for to keep some sort of level of
consistency I'm just going to kind of
fight from here beside the truck for a
little while so you guys can kind of see
what we're going for here shoot some
dudes I'll press 3 to toggle dual scope
not going to do that because that's not
gonna help me benchmark more
consistently so try to shoot this guy I
missed him
Slick's actually a better gamer than I
am but I do the benchmarking because
yeah he's not allowed to do benchmarking
he gets all intense he's all like
headshot I'm like yeah they're bots you
know don't worry about it and he's all
like whatever man
no I'm kidding that's not how it went
down so yeah we're just gonna kind of
stand around here and fight for a little
bit oh I'm hurt gotta get to cover you
that'll make you feel better
mm oh really oh yeah it's done okay so
pretty much that is going to be our
modern warfare 3 benchmark we're
actually only going to be testing the
560 Ti for 48 against where the heck is
it the regular gtx 560 R 570 of GTX 570
and that is going to tell us how it
compares because spec wise it's very
similar to the 570 except it's shorter
so you can see though tax card is
shorter actually includes out here come
over here come over here this is
important so so tax implementation of
the 448 core limited edition 550 ti 560
Ti actually includes two DVI a
full-sized HDMI and DisplayPort whereas
a regular gtx 570 includes two DVI and
one mini HDMI so that's a pretty cool
implementation it's actually
surprisingly quiet it's not very loud at
all and it's significantly shorter than
a 570 so if you have a smaller case that
actually might help although I see those
PCIe connectors are coming off of the
back so you're only going to gain about
an extra this much or so versus a
regular gtx 570 the prices are similar
but yeah let's find out how these two
cards actually perform against each
other so while I don't necessarily agree
within videos naming scheme of calling
it a gtx 560 TI 448 core because i think
it might be more accurate to call it
something like a gtx 565 it definitely
does fall into its intended place um
it's pretty late so we only did a couple
benchmarks on this guy but pretty much
we've got the 560 Ti in full crisis 2 we
couldn't get battlefield 3 launched and
then when we finally did get it launched
our save games were gone
so we went with modern warfare 3 so you
can basically see it's anywhere from a 5
to 10% difference in performance
remember guys we're testing two cards
here the 560 Ti for 48 and the 570 that
are literally identical in terms of
their frame buffer the actual chip that
they are using they're the same
architecture the same driver so this
pretty much gives us an idea of what
kind of a performance difference we can
expect at all high settings at 1080p
between these two cards so if you're
shopping for a 560 TI 448 versus a GTX
570 hopefully this gives you some idea
of what you're looking at so anywhere
between 5 to 10% less expensive is what
I would expect from a GTX 560 TI 448 and
I think that's pretty much it so guys
don't forget to subscribe to - tech tips
from our unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and I hope you enjoyed
our however brief coverage of the gtx
560 TI 448 core from ZOTAC and big
thanks to ZOTAC for making this possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
