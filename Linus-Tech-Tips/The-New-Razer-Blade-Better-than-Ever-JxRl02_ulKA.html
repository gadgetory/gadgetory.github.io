two products to ever win an Editors
Choice Award from me is finally here
this is the new razor blade from well
razor
mass drop is currently hosting a drop
for a set of csgo themed key caps learn
more about them and many other awesome
drops at the link in the video
description so let's get this out of the
way right off the hop razor is actually
calling this thing the new razor blade
are you freaking kidding me for starters
razor you already had a product called
the razor blade it had a 17 inch primary
screen and this weird supplementary one
with a trackpad built into it that was
why you called the 14 inch model the
blade 14 when you launched it in 2013
you even remember this but okay fine
I'll forgive that if for no reason other
than that you've already been doing it
for a few years at this point and while
we're at it I'll forgive the way you
call each new iteration the same damn
thing forcing retailers and reviewers to
augment these with long ass part numbers
and/or release years you didn't start
that I blame Apple for that no no the
reason I'm mad is that you keep
compounding the problem you've actually
removed it now but shortly after the
launch of this one you actually had last
year's model on the site as the blade
qhd+ something it was never called and
something that's not helpful because the
new blade that you had on the site at
the same time also has a qhd+ screen I
mean stop this who do you think you are
Nvidia anyway with that out of my system
let's get down to business the new blade
features an 0.7 inch thick 4.25 pound
unibody aluminum chassis with decent
stereo speakers and as I mentioned
before a 14-inch 3200 by 1800 XO LCD
just like last year and while the panel
still sports a larger than ideal bezel
still doesn't handle off angle viewing
as well as the best IPS displays out
there and still lack support for g-sync
or higher refresh rates I understand
that the bezel is big to allow for more
room for cooling and it still got the
10-point multi-touch screen something
that most other gaming laptops
lack which is a trade-off that I
personally will take I didn't realize
quite how often I use it to zoom in or
reposition something on the screen until
I ordered an XPS 15 for review check
that out here by the way that didn't
have it also back for another round is
in videos Maxwell architecture gtx 970m
graphics processor it's unclear if
anything about the silicon or binning
process has been tuned to improve
thermals or battery life both of which
are improved but we do know that it's
been upgraded to six gigs of VRAM this
time around let's take this opportunity
then to run through the rest of the
specs the Haswell 4700 HQ quad core has
been booted out the door in favor of a
shiny new skylake core i7 6700 HQ which
I left running the i-264 stress test the
entire time I wrote this review only to
see it reach about 80 to 85 degrees max
at room temperature an acceptable result
the one that does come at an acoustical
cost and it's one that won't hold true
with a GPU load added to the mix so the
thermal system improvements seem to be
more focused on keeping heat away from
the users hands with actual CPU
temperatures as a secondary objective
since it does still throttle here's a
shot though with our thermal camera to
show how well they achieved the primary
objective very impressive
my favorite notebook webcam and it's
excellent microphone return yay the old
Intel Wireless gets replaced with a
killer 1535 solution that I was
skeptical about but that behaved very
well and managed some of the fastest
most consistent wireless file transfers
that I've seen 16 gigs of DDR 4 RAM is
now standard on every model and storage
across the board has been upgraded to
nvme instead of SATA based solid state
drives they are using the value PM 951
model instead of the 950 Pro from
Samsung but this is still a big
improvement so there's nothing to
complain about here but nothing really
earth-shattering either the big stuff
actually happened on the outside at
first glance it
the same but IO has gotten much much
better on the left you'll find power in
magnetic next time please
a couple USB 3 five gigabit ports and a
headphone microphone jack then on the
right you will find an hdmi 1.4 B port
another USB 3 and ok so this is the only
actual improvement nothing else changed
a USB type-c connector that can handle
an additional USB device or Thunderbolt
3 with DisplayPort SiC right
Type C is just so cool in so many ways
little things like charging your type C
phone faster all the way up to big
things like plugging in high-speed
external storage devices or even an
external GPU with products like the
razor core set to be available very very
shortly the one thing really missing
here for me is an SD card reader and
then it would be there I say it perfect
there's more to I can't quantify this
but the touchpad definitely feels like
it tracks more smoothly and more
consistently and the keyboard has also
been upgraded it is still my same
favorite laptop keyboard from a tactile
standpoint and now that Luke has won his
word for something along the lines of I
never really understood why you're
always raving about this thing but wow I
get it now except that it now has the
same RGB upgrade as the blade stealth so
gone then is the gamer II font you've
got all the usual controls that you
would expect out of an RGB keyboard it
WAV this breathe that change color there
I think it's something stupid like 14
different brightness level adjustments
with the only downgrade and this is a
huge bummer for me actually being that
backlighting on the secondary functions
of the f keys and the number row razor
tells me this is due to the position of
the switch but frankly I'd have
preferred a smaller font and just kind
of cramming it over there is no longer
backlit which sucks because these are
the things that I'm most likely to have
trouble remembering in the dark let's
move on to the gaming experience that
frankly hasn't changed much some games
that push both CPU and Jeep
very very hard will cause you to
encounter your thermal limits and the
970m
is still not beefy enough to really gain
at higher than 1080p in most titles if
you want to turn details up so there's
not much to report here but one key
difference is that whether it's gaming
or whether it's productivity the new
blades battery life is better enough
that I actually noticed the difference
day to day I didn't turn the keyboard
lights completely off / the reviewers
guide but I did dim them to about the
same level that I normally use about 30%
which leads us into the conclusion I
think the blade 14 2015 was already good
enough that it was my first choice with
the blade stealth given how little I
came on the go and how freaking light
yet well-constructed it is being the
first device that I've encountered that
looked even capable of dethroning it
only to never even enter the ring due to
its 8 gig ram limitation so then it
shouldn't be a shocker that the new
blade 2016 model is going to hold its
throne almost everything about the old
blade I cannot emphasize enough how
butthurt I am about the half key
illumination is undeniably superior and
that's impressive but what's really
impressive is that they've done all of
this while significantly lowering the
razor tax as I call it in the past
friends would ask me they'd see this
laptop they'd be like that looks sick
should I get one I'd say wow I really
like mine but that's easy for me to say
I didn't pay for it it's very very
expensive well that changes here and I
am really liking the path razors on
bringing down the cost of their machines
but without the compromises to spec or
build quality that have made pcs a
second-class citizen
compared to Mac books for anyone who
wants a beautiful well-constructed
mobile device good job guys
keep it up and good job - ting keep up
what you guys are doing there the mobile
carrier that is focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction first
I mean yeah sure there's all the little
details like only paying for
or exactly what you use with the average
bill being only 24 bucks a month there's
the whole thing where you can go on
their site if Linus ENCOM we've got that
linked in the video description enter
your last few bills from your existing
carrier and finding out easily in just a
few minutes if ting will be cheaper for
you but the most important thing is that
when you call ting if there's some kind
of a problem let's say something goes
wrong someone picks up and says hello
can I help you
there is no automated phone system not
because they couldn't figure out how to
do that
but because they don't think it's a good
idea they're very customer centric and
if you want to become a customer they've
got an offer for you
they will cover up to 25% of your
cancellation fee so it's up to 75 bucks
and if you use our link again that's
Linus ENCOM you'll also get 25 bucks in
service credit or towards a new device
