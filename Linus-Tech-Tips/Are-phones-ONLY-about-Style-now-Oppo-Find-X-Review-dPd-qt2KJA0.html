Oppo find X for weeks now not because I
didn't want to do it but because I've
actually in my opinion very patiently
been waiting for them to fix a game
breaking bugs that has made the phone
infuriating for me to use as a daily
driver well it's still not fixed but the
clocks run out and we're just gonna have
to go ahead with this is the phone with
arguably the world's sexiest design
actually any good or are we just being
expected to spend a thousand US dollars
for a fashion statement you know what's
not a thousand dollars though the
sponsor for this video noble chairs
their icon series gaming chairs are
inspired by luxury sports car interiors
which offer an elegant and comfortable
sitting position
learn more at the link below
one of the first things I do with any
new device that isn't an iPhone with
Apple's taptic engine is turn off the
haptic feedback Android devices suck at
this basically across the board but the
find X's is particularly bad given the
price point and you guys are probably
sitting there thinking wow that's an
awfully nitpicky thing to open with on a
device review but it kind of sets the
stage for my overall impressions of the
find X more on that later though first
let's get to the good stuff
nothing nothing I've ever touched feels
quite as premium as the find X op oh and
by extension their subsidiary Oh oneplus
have spent years playing catch-up to the
Samsungs
and the apples of the world but the find
X is clearly a statement piece that
stands entirely on its own the gentle
notch on the back where it belongs and
the way that the rear cover accent color
shifts from subtle to bold depending on
the angle gives it a truly distinctive
look and furthermore the form factor not
to mention the balance of this thing is
damn near perfect with gently curved
Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and
back that tapers to a nearly seamless
transition to the chassis that manages
to fit comfortably in your hand pretty
much no matter how you want to hold it
that is assuming of course that you can
keep a handle on it at all this is an
exceptionally slippery phone my unit
actually ended up falling off of a
surface that was very gently inclined
minutes after I had placed it there
because of subtle vibrations from a
nearby speaker fortunately there was no
damage which was a bit surprising
especially given the engineering marvel
that is opposed front camera and facial
recognition system simply swipe the lock
screen or open up the camera app and
you'll be greeted with a competent
little selfie camera and a sophisticated
facial scanning array that managed to
match the speed of the iPhone 10 in my
testing and actually the good news keeps
rolling here the specs of the find X
right on par with any other flagship
phone on the market meaning that you'll
be enjoying the best experience that
Android has to offer and you'll look
good doing it
at least until snapdragon 855 shows up
in the next few months and sorry did I
say the best Android has to offer no
it's not that it might be the best that
opposed color OS has to offer but color
OS is quite frankly not representative
of the best that Android has to offer
there are just so many usability issues
here I mean first up was the
impossibility of setting up an oppo
account for recovery purposes long story
short I finally fought through the steps
of multiple instances of verification
with no copy/paste allowed for whatever
reason and got to this Chinese site that
according to my in-laws said something
about being verified and then I tried to
login all need to be told the account
isn't active and it's still not active
apparently then I was really impressed
by the way that Apple handles junk ware
installation giving you the option on
first boot to nuke it that is until I
realized that there's lots of stuff
still on the phone and there is no way
to switch to an app drawer style
homescreen with the stock launcher so
what that means is that anyone who is
not a power user is gonna end up with a
useless junk folder like on the iPhone
let's continue I'm not really one to
complain about the visual style of an
Android skin in general and color OS
mostly seems fine to me but this one
might actually be a first for me the
system font really grinds my gears and
not for like artsy reasons I just have a
much harder time telling at a glance if
my messages are unread in my gmail app
for example now to oppose credit the
find X has great battery life but I was
pretty annoyed when I found out one of
the reasons why it turns out it's been
putting my hangouts app to sleep
entirely without asking me if I wanted
that behavior go ahead David
send me
hangout right now so what happens is I
just don't get my notifications until I
open up the app manually at which point
I will get spammed by everyone who's
been trying to reach me for the last
hour this is the thing I reported to
Oppo three weeks ago there's the pain
that currently has no ETA for a fix
then buggy behavior in chrome and that
usual nonsense where Netflix has to be
installed manually with an apk instead
of through the Play Store on some
Chinese phones it's just icing on the
cake
I mean yeah every one of those things
except the hangouts thing that's really
stupid every one of those things is a
pretty minor issue on the surface but
the longer the short of it is a phone is
it's like your daily companion you take
it with you everywhere it's about the
experience and I didn't like using this
phone it just cuts a lot of little
corners for the sake of being sexy like
that crummy vibration motor that I
mentioned earlier and it just doesn't do
enough to redeem itself in my eyes the
camera launches quickly but it can't be
triggered with a DoubleTap of the lock
screen and it is decent at best
especially given the price and this pain
train is just leaving the station folks
the find X lacks NFC making two factor
authentication more of a chore it's not
waterproof or even water-resistant
presumably due to the sliding camera
mechanism it doesn't have wireless
charging it has no microSD slot for
expansion it doesn't have a headphone
jack it doesn't have an always-on
display or even wake on lift meaning
that you will need to unlock the screen
and swipe it to activate their facial
recognition every time you want to turn
it on and the display isn't HDR
certified for Netflix which results in
noticeably worse image quality to go
along with the degraded mono speaker
listening experience bottom line if you
were considering buying the find ex
get a note 9 it's better in every
measurable way speaking of better memory
expresses well they're they're better
than my old go-to canadian retailer
which has gone out of business so
whether you're a gamer business owner or
quite literally anyone else Mad Max is
your go-to destination in Canada for
electronic products and services plus
with their uber price beat guaranteed
they'll beat any authorized Canadian
retailers price by 10% of the difference
both in store and online so check out
the link below to memory Express and by
the way they're coming soon to Victoria
and Saskatoon so thanks for watching
guys if this video sucked or if you work
at Oppo you know what to do but if it
was awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured in the video
