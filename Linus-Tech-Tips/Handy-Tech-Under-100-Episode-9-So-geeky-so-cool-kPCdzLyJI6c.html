some of you said that the items in
Episode eight weren't handy enough well
this time I am stepping up my game I
will be showing you guys the best handy
you can get for under $100
Kingston kc3 ten series business great
SSDs feature firmware based power loss
protection massive capacities and
performance to spare in fact we're using
them for our new production server click
right here to learn more about them
since I was so rudely interrupted during
my intro take a moment now to beg for
legs like a pathetic loser and ask that
you guys mash that like button if you
want to see a small form-factor PC
flagship graphics card showdown between
the 980ti and the r9 fury X and NIT X
build Go Go Go Go Go and then moving on
to item number one today have you ever
noticed that no matter what when you're
in a hurry and fishing through a bin or
a USB cable to charge a phone or plug in
a hub or whatever if the device you want
to connect uses a micro B connector
invariably the first cable you find will
be mini B the second one you find will
be mini B and so on and so forth until
you're so mad you can't even see
straight to dig out the right one this
is known as Murphy's Law and you know
what Murphy
introducing the USB cable noose with one
of these bad boys around the next time
you get so upset about not being able to
find the right cable that you're ready
to just end it all you reach for the
nearest noose and bam it turns out that
upon closer inspection the USB noose is
made of dozens of USB cables in both the
mini and micro variety
it's amazing the kinds of solutions that
exist for this problem
bracelets cards that fit in your wallet
will screw it those are expensive and
for the price of one fancy cable I could
buy a dozen cheap ones in bulk so you
don't have to make a new side of them
that was a joke but if you run into this
issue as often as I do take 10 minutes
and grab a bulk order of cables they're
like 75 cents each
I bought a hundred of them for the new
office and I couldn't be happier for my
under $100 purchase which leads us to
the second item today this one is pretty
straightforward and something I didn't
even really think of until I reviewed
the new MacBook and found
self marveling at apples boldness I mean
can you imagine another company just
forging ahead and not only implementing
a connector that exists nowhere else
within their own product lineup and
hardly anywhere else at all but making
it the only connector on the device
how does Apple get away with this stuff
thanks to innovative things like this
the Kingston DataTraveler 3 see it's got
a regular USB type a connector that will
work with a regular 2.0 3.0 or 3.1 port
on the one side then a reversible USB
type-c connector on the other end when
you lift up the protective plastic cover
awesome now to be clear at a rated speed
of 10 to 15 megabytes per second on
writes and 100 megabytes per second on
reads this is not the world's highest
performance flash drive or anything but
it's also not unreasonably priced at
around 50 cents per gig on the 64 gig
model making it competitive with other
commodity grade USB 3 drives it's not
perfect and I think Kingston could
improve this product and actually many
of their USB drives by making it a
little bit more keychain friendly but
even with that shortcoming if I was
gonna buy a utility drive today
this one makes a ton of sense thanks to
its awesome versatility which leads us
to our last handy tech item one that
I've had on the shelf for literally
months because it's so geeky and cool
that I wanted to make a video about it
and yet most people wouldn't really have
much use for it this is the USB charger
doctor from Adafruit comm there are
other similar devices but for my
purposes I didn't need such an expensive
one and this one is less than 10 bucks
the concept is simple if you ever
wondered why the crap your phone is
charging so slowly in this charger or
off of that battery bank ever wondered
why the USB hub on your Logitech G 15
gen 1 can't power anything more hungry
than a thumb drive with this puppy you
can monitor both the output voltage of
any USB port and the current being drawn
by the devices downstream it handles
from 0 to 3 amps and three and a half to
seven volts and it's accurate to within
ten millivolts and 10 milliamps I've
actually used it a handful of times
since I got it already and I'll
definitely be using it more in the
future
I wish that it had the connectors on
either end so that it wasn't so bulky
when plugged in but hey I guess you get
what you pay for this is the cheap one
which leads us to the full disclosure
part of these handy tech episodes
item number one I purchased from
monoprice comm to make this video and
for Linus Media Group's as well as my
own use
number two was provided by Kingston when
I asked them for a sample of a USB
type-c device for that video that I made
a little while ago and then actually
wasn't going to get a spot in its own
video until I needed it during my
macbook video and I was like oh yeah
this is handy handy under 100 and then
item number three was suggested by a
viewer so I bought a couple of them and
that's pretty much it straightforward
