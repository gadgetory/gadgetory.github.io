games it all started when I was about 10
my brother and I did chores around the
house for cash until we saved up enough
money for mom to buy us a Super Nintendo
off some creepy dudes I was scared at
the time ever since then I've been
hooked and I don't just play the game I
read books about this I collect the
figurines of the character I just can't
stop I even brought my obsession to work
fortunately for me my job's really cool
and that's okay here so today I get to
check out the analogue NT mini beyond
being the most beautifully crafted piece
of console hardware that I have ever
laid my hands on it's got amazing
under-the-hood capabilities too with a
1080p capable HDMI out and an RGB all in
one output for nests and Famicom games
and it can be yours for 449 that's four
hundred and forty-nine dollars
so tax magnet en 10 mini gaming PC is VR
and triple-a gaming ready check it out
at the link in the video description
everything about this is the Cadillac
experience this is the most
comprehensive i/o setup I could imagine
for a ness or a Famicom you've got all
the obvious stuff power button power
input whatever but most of the rest of
this is going to look pretty exotic
there are too thoughtfully padded
cartridge slots on the top that allow
both the Ness and Famicom games from any
region to be played natively without any
form of adapters on the front you'll
find a whopping 4 console inputs for the
handful of games that can take advantage
of this and moving around to the back
there's a USB charging port for the
included low latency wireless controller
that can be used to power the system on
for a surprisingly modern feeling
experience the SD card slot can be used
for all kinds of fun more on that later
then moving back around the back we find
a Famicom expansion port helpfully
labelled in Japanese for compatibility
with obscure accessories like the
Famicom disk system and what it even has
a mic jack for the tiny number of
Famicom games that could actually use a
microphone fun fact winwaker was not the
first zelda game to pull this boat stuff
audio outputs are standard but video is
another story you get this analog output
port that can be adapted with a breakout
cable to pretty much anything you could
want and it has native HDMI which is
much more challenging to do properly
than you might think more on that later
which leads us finally to the internals
conveniently enjoyable through the
window in the bottom of the unit an odd
choice but nerds will like it I like it
it's actually on the other side of this
PCB where you find the heart and soul of
the system the altera cyclone 5 fpga
hardware which has been custom
configured by an electrical engineer
with over 5000 hours of experience
re-engineering fpga systems for absolute
mess accuracy this is incredibly
important
and this is what you are paying for the
empty mini is not some random emulation
box in fact it's not an emulation box at
all instead of writing a bunch of
software code to fake the functionality
of Nintendo's original hardware
everything is done in HDL or Hardware
definition language this is how they
achieved an identical experience to the
original nest 100% compatibility 110
accuracy zero additional lag but is it
actually solid I threw everything that I
had at it and experienced no issues
whatsoever that weren't caused by my
dusty old carts this is not the
experience that I've had with other
off-brand retro systems that I've tried
and I do acknowledge that I don't have
every game on earth but I couldn't find
a single instance of anyone online
having any issues either there's even a
new game that came out like not that
long ago why people are still making the
internets I don't know but it works it
uses all four controller ports it's all
fine but back to the NT mini how can an
HDMI output claim to be faithful to the
original experience well this is not
your dad's HDMI output or if your dad
had one I guess it would have been but
anyways if you experience lag it's your
TV or monitor there is no external
converter to add latency the HDMI
transmitter is top notch and the
Settings menu has extensive color audio
and scanline tweaks for nerds
and I know you could save a box by
running the majority of these games on
something like a Raspberry Pi but if
you're a purist this is reference
quality which is hard to achieve without
lugging a CRT around your house like I
do the NT Mini is objectively better
than emulation and functionally better
than even the original console which
brings us back to that SD card slot the
anti mini has been jailbroken their
words not mine this allows you to dump
cartridges you own into ROM files
directly on that SD card and even play
roms right off of it without using
emulation you can use safe States and
run save files though I will judge you
just a little you should even be able to
use it to low
additional fpga cores then with
controller and cartridge adapters play
other retro games on a similar hardware
level like Sega Master System games Game
Gear colecovision Game Boy Game Boy
Color Atari 2600 Atari 7800 and
television Odyssey to adventure vision
supervision the RCA studio 2 and more
there's like 20-plus of them and on top
of that you've got an NSF player four
Tunes a built in game genie if you want
to screw around and an extensive
settings menu that would have merited
its own entire video if I had my way but
this video is near ending and it is
conclusion time there are many other
solutions
most of them cheaper some of them I've
mentioned already others like the
framemeister low latency analog to
digital converter and upscaler that I
have it and there are pros and cons to
all I don't plan to sell my framemeister
because it's still useful for other
consoles like the snaps ps1 or even Xbox
360 and I also don't own this this is
works frame masters 9 but this NT Mini
in my humble opinion is the best way to
play games will be supported by kept
Reese's fpga core releases it delivers
everything from a reference to a highly
customizable experience and does it in a
compact beautiful package that will look
great in your man cave just add friends
and beer assuming you have any money
left over for beer or friends fresh
books is the accounting software for
small businesses and freelancers its
cloud-based so you can always get at it
meaning that all those tools it has
expense tracking our tracking the
ability to create and send
professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds are always at your
fingertips it's also designed for the
way that you work so you can accept
payments on your terms
things like accepting deposits are
easily handled through fresh books and
being able to send out an invoice and
see when the client has seen your
invoice puts an end to the bull stuff
guessing games of like oh yeah
I didn't see that I'll pay you you know
later
it's all about getting paid and getting
paid the right amount at the right time
and with fresh books you can do that so
I had two fresh books talk on flash tech
tips and enter tech tips and how you've
heard about us section we've got it
linked below thanks for watching guys
this video sucks you know what to do
with who's awesome get subscribed hit
the like button or even check out the
link for where to buy stuff on Amazon I

would like also down there if you're
like our must buy things immediately we
have our shirts linked you can buy this
shirt down there that would be pretty
cool if you want to see another video
click this one which is the link to the
analogue and 8-bit Doh controller video
which is like this thing literally right
here it comes in the box when you buy
the MT Mini you get it so if you're
interested in buying the NT vide might
as well watch that video you see the
other thing you get in the box
there's a lot of words to explain that
you should watch a controller video see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
