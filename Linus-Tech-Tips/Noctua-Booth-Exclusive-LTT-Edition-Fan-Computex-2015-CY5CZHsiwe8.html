Computex this year and also thank you to
Linda calm a lot can happen in three
years half-life 3 can still not be
announced linus media group can become a
company and fallout 4 can finally be
announced if you want to go back three
years and cringe a little bit you can
look at Linus's first nff 12 video is
unboxing from way back when just as a
refresher on the NFF 12 it has a focus
flow frame vortex control notches a
haptic perf impeller stepped Inlet
design inner surface micro structures
and anti-vibration pads and these are
all reasons why we use them on our
radiator reviews every freakin time
but why we're here today is the general
color of the NFF 12 and those
anti-vibration pads that I just
mentioned - is one of his own version of
a fan for quite a while and as you guys
have all known he's been a huge fan of
the Noctua nff 12 since its inception
so he's been teasing on the lan show for
probably about a year now that he's been
trying to work with a manufacturer on a
new fan and as most of you actually
guessed yes it was Noctua and we have to
announce this this isn't exactly what it
will look like this is an industrial PPC
fan but it'll be black as an n FF 12 and
have these orange anti-vibration mounts
and anti-vibration pads now if you're
happy that we're releasing an n FF 12 in
black but aren't a huge fan of the
orange anti-vibration stuff you can go
the simple route of just removing them
and then having a no additional cost
full black n FF 12 or you can go the
cool chrome axe route which is the new
thing from noctua
which is a variety of different colors
for their anti-vibration mounting which
comes in red blue yellow green white or
black we don't have the white or black
ones here right now but those colors are
fairly self-explanatory now if you're
wondering where you can get this from
how much it'll cost all that kind of
stuff most of that is still to be
determined you it'll probably be
shipping from the states it'll probably
cost somewhere between a normal n FF 12
and an industrial PPC version and we
might only be doing one run of it
although basically all of that is going
to be determined by you guys so let us
know in the comments down below this
video or even preferably over on the
forum but like and dislike button on
this video will kind of determine your
guys's feedback so are you personally
interested in this if so like it if you
are not personally interested in this
dislike the video all of your feedback
is highly appreciated thanks to msi for
bringing us here this year huge help
they're a giant part of the core reason
why we're actually able to make it to
Computex this year check out their bitly
link in the description down below this
video to see all the stuff that they
launched at Computex 2015 including a
bunch of laptops with Broadwell
processors also thank you to
lynda.com/latoya comm / Computex you can
start learning today with a 10 day free
trial last but not least let lioness
know what you think this has been his
passion project for a really long time
so if you agree with him let him know if
you disagree with him also let him know
like the video just like the video share
it favourite it subscribe follow all
that kind of good stuff don't forget to
comment we're gonna read everything for
this video I'm sure Linus will follow
