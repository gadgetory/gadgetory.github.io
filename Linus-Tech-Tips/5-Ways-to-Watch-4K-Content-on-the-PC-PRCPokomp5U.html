anniversary and being good Canucks and
all we wondered what better way to show
off our raw patriotism and dedication to
the maple leaf than some good
old-fashioned Netflix and chill but
watching 4k content on the PC is not as
simple as you might think
so when Intel reached out to sponsor a
video featuring their seventh generation
nook we jumped at the opportunity to
cover how exactly it works and it is
going to be such a wild ride that your
knuckles are bound to be white by the
end of it okay that last one was a bit
of a stretch stretch like this
the reasons for hooking your TV up to a
PC rather than a lower-cost HDMI stick
like a chromecast or a streaming box
mostly come down to flexibility you can
run whatever software you want interface
seamlessly with storage devices on your
network and even use the media PC itself
as a file server for the rest of the
household with external storage so here
then is the PC we chose this isn't the
fastest hook available but we
specifically requested the i5 variant
for a few reasons at under $400 we liked
its balance of features performance and
cost the i5 Nook is quite a bit shorter
and more compact and its lower power
consumption partly thanks to offloading
video decoding to the on-board GPU and
noise will make for a better home
theater experience we configured it in
about 20 minutes with a 128 gig Intel
600 P series SSD - 6 of crucial ddr4
memory and a fresh copy of Windows 10
now when we first did our proof of
concept testing for this video we turned
to our tried and tested LGU d88
4k monitors unfortunately while they
support HDCP 2.2 we ran into some
handshaking issues but it just wouldn't
be a video 1 ultra HD without a problem
with DRM would it thankfully our bros
over at LG hooked us up with a much more
recent not to mention bigger screen to
play with the LG OLED 65 B 6p an
enormous 65 inch Ultra HD premium
certified OLED TV with the now-familiar
and awesome webOS interface and
gyroscopic remote as usual my message
here is the same OLED have I mentioned
OLED yet with it's unbelievable contrast
is the future and I'm actually really
glad that we're using this for our UHD
testing instead so with the hardware out
of the way let's get into our first
method of 4k content consumption
local playback of normal computer files
while there isn't much legitimately out
there at the moment we can handle both
freely available test files and any
consumer 4k video capture thanks to
everybody's favorite flexible media
player VLC number two everybody's
favorite free streaming site YouTube
first demoed 4k playback in 2014 and
that was without requiring any elaborate
hardware based DRM more on that in a
moment
and they added HDR 10 support in late
2016 though it should be noted that very
little HDR content is available at this
time
our CPU usage on our nook stayed at
between 5 and 10%
thanks to that GPU decoding that I
mentioned earlier number three all right
so this box has full support for the
controversial software guard extensions
for playback 3.0 DRM that's been
spearheaded by the content production
industry which lets us access then
streaming services like Netflix and
Amazon Prime video at full UHD 4k
quality as long as we're using Windows
tens edge browser though it should be
noted that the native Netflix app also
supports UHD playback number four there
are also digital stores like Sony
Pictures of store and soon Microsoft's
Windows Store and film and TV app both
of which if you have the DRM compliance
built into your PC will support 4k
videos but none of the stuff I've
mentioned is especially new and all of
it is either limited in terms of content
availability or in terms of sound and
image quality so what about method
number 5 I promise five playing back UHD
blu-ray z' that option was
absent four months after the launch of
4k blu-ray and there is a significant
and very noticeable difference in
quality between an internet stream
running at about 6 megabytes per second
versus a discs bit rate which can nearly
triple at that is where our shiny new
pioneer BDR 2:11 ubk comes in imported
straight from the Land of the Rising Sun
it's the world's first and at this time
only Ultra HD compatible PC blu-ray
drive and given a decline in physical
media use in modern computers it's
likely to retain its title for some time
with support for almost literally every
major disc based format sort of like
laserdisc and this along with a five and
a quarter inch enclosure is the PSLE
resistance of our 4k playback PC it
actually worked
far more painlessly than you'd expect
but like our UHD streaming services it
doesn't work without hardware support
and a software install for the software
guard extensions DRM so then we are now
able to consume virtually any content
that we can go to a store or online and
buy as long as its movies so can we game
on this thing I mean there is a
Thunderbolt 3 port on there so this
being Linus tech tips of course we
grabbed a razor core slapped in a gtx
980ti and plugged it in to see what it
would do the answer well from my
experience the much higher clocked core
i7 variants of intel's mobile chips are
quite a bit more potent for this use
case the good news though is that steams
in-home streaming is a thing if you
really want to have a gaming PC
experience on the couch with the i-5 and
you have another gaming PC elsewhere on
your network our 4k 60fps gaming stream
ran perfect
over a standard gigabit wired network
connection so in summary then we
basically been looking for an excuse to
buy one of these new blu-ray drives and
test UHD compatibility on the latest PCs
with the hardware DRM support and
hopefully seeing it all pretty much
working outside of some question marks
with respect to monitor HDCP
compatibility what is interesting for
you guys as it was for us so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome

stuff we featured in the video

store which has cool shirts like this
