brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair memory and
western digital hey guys we're the AMD
event still and we're checking out
Microsoft's project spark so in this
fast as you can what is spark it is an
open world digital canvas that allows
anyone to create play or share whatever
they can imagine so it's it's I've heard
reference to little big planet although
before you go into a rant about that I
can totally see how it's very different
it's a lot more in-depth what can you
tell me about that well the breadth of
what we offer i think is is is really
our selling point and the logic we have
this entire visual coding language that
allows anyone you don't need to be an
engineer to allow scripting you don't
need to be an artist to create these big
worlds we're really breaking down those
disciplines that are barriers to people
and that's really a big thing for us one
of the coolest things I saw was we had a
human and we had a rock and everything
in this game can potentially have a
brain which we've looked at before and
the human had a fairly straightforward
brain you'd follow the camera he do some
other stuff now the rock we gave it a
bird's brain so I started flying around
randomly I like that you can do stuff
like that because you can be super
creative what kind of just shoot a
couple examples of the games you could
potentially make an asst oh I mean we've
we've shown a couple already someone
made a recreation of geometry wars which
is a like this vector based game blew
our minds somebody even made a movie a
20 minute movie like we didn't even
think it's you know you think of a game
creator they didn't even decide to allow
interaction it's just we're telling you
the story and that's what it is and some
of the other stuff that we've seen
people make our just these it's how
things interact with it a one guy made a
car using logs with rope and these cubes
any put them in a certain way and it's
just it's amazing that's really cool now
if you were to go on project spark and
make one of these games and try and
distribute it how does that work in like
rating systems and stuff like that well
it's super easy to share it so as soon
as you're ready to
show off what you've created you save it
you share it in anybody with the windows
8.1 xbox 360 xbox one will be able to
download and play it and the community
they'll get it they'll be able to rate
it up thumbs up thumbs down or whatever
they feel and the community just race
them you'll be able to see how many
downloads versus how many likes cool
that's really fun for project creators
because I know when I was a little kid I
used to play an RPG maker and like that
was fun but I didn't really get to share
with anyone except for my mom which was
cool and she always loved it but she's
my mom so I don't know it's it's really
interesting and we can see in the
background here this guy's made an
island kind of thing with a moat and a
cave on it and some dude in there and
he's only been working on this for a
very short period of time now how could
someone start playing this game well the
game is available right now on Windows
8.1 if you go to join project spark calm
you'll be able to sign up for the beta
right and download it through the
windows store perfect now you said it
was coming to xbox one and 360 too so
that would just be on the marketplace so
like say yeah windows 8 beta is out now
xbox one will be coming out within the
month or two and we haven't announced
dates for the others no problem we want
to arc on them too much for that thank
you for watching our content on

sponsors for sending us here this year
