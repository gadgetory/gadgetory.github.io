possibly the worst retail box that I've
ever seen this is the Drobo s as you can
tell by the small sticker located
somewhere on the outside of what
otherwise looks like a shipping carton
so I went and I opened it up thinking oh
there's probably a retail Drobo unit
inside
no no they sent me an OEM one which is
fine there are retail boxes and that's
what you'll see at your local NCIX store
but for the purpose of the video that
we're doing they just sent me an OEM one
because I don't think they realized I
was going to do an unboxing in addition
to the actual tech tips video so here we
are let's find out what comes with the
data robotics drove o s welcome to the
world of drill bo alright so we have
power got your AC to DC adapter got your
AC power cord which is your standard
computer one rather than being that
notebook one that there's never one
handy when you need one so that's
perfect restore CD as well as a getting
started guide which is about 4,000 feet
suspect I really hope this isn't a
number of different languages here yes
it is oh good because if the manual is
that thick and the whole point of this
product is that it's easy to use then a
step was missed somewhere okay here we
go USB 3 cable eSATA cable nice long
robust feeling eSATA cable there very
confident about this particular SATA
cable it's about a one-line as height so
a little bit more so it's about 6 feet
tall long and then we also have a
FireWire B cable so they include high
quality versions of pretty much all of
the cables you require and nice long
cables too so they're not like a lot of
companies with their external enclosures
that include short little rinky-dinky
cables so that you have to put the
blocks next to your monitor or next to
your PC they give you the option to put
it somewhere more convenient so this is
also a 6 foot long cable and that's the
USB 3 a 2b so that's the extra pins are
all in there remember you can
a USB 2 a 2 B cable so that's like your
standard printer cable but it will only
operate at USB 2.0 speed so let's go
ahead and tuck all of this stuff away
and get the actual Drobo s itself out of
the box so it comes a very very well
packed you can see it's using a closed
cell phone with a good inch of empty
space an inch plus of empty space on all
sides so your Drobo is going to be nice
and protected in transit all right take
these on there you go I always prefer
closed cell phone because it is more
durable and more resistant to multiple
impacts it also has a nice little dust
cover on it so it's not gonna get
scratched or anything ok go ahead and
extract it so the Drobo s is the natural
progression from the original Drobo so
this is sorry this isn't the network
version of the Drobo that's the Drobo FS
but the advantage is that this one has
over the original Drobo is that it has
five base as opposed to the original
Drobo's four base it also has a much
much wider variety of interfaces so the
original Drobo was only USB and then
there was an additional version of it
that I think added fire wear something
like that yeah and then the Drobo s adds
to that by providing not only USB but
USB 3 eSATA I think there was an eSATA
version at some point as well
ok whatever this one is the current one
this is the one that matters USB 3 2
firewire 800 ports eSATA your power
Kensington lock so that you can make
sure that it doesn't walk away on you a
power switch on the back oh that's just
the power cycle switch interesting or ok
we'll have to find out why it is that it
turns itself off right away maybe it's a
matter of it has to actually be plugged
in in order to do that you've also got a
reset button here and the cooling fan at
the back of the unit so I wonder if I
can even take this apart the Drobo was
meant to be more of an appliance so you
can see here there's a warranty void if
removed so I'm not going to be taking
the panels apart
actually pulling the unit limb from limb
let me just see if I can figure out how
big that fan is at the back cuz I wanted
to be able to sell you guys yeah that's
a 120 millimeter fan I can see the
blades moving now
so the 120 millimeter fan at the back
which means that it's going to stay nice
and cool and also be very quiet when
it's pulling air across the drives
remember once you install a drive in
here it will stay open like that in fact
you know what let's just throw a drive
in here really quick so that you guys
can see here we go so here are some of
the drives that we're going to be using
to test out of the drill both I haven't
talked much about what makes dribble
special overall though so let's show the
easy installation first it's just kind
of yeah
there we go that rear so locks in place
like that so you can put it up to five
drives and once it's open you can see
there's actually a gap so some air flow
will come through so what makes Drobo
special Drobo is the easy answer to rate
so raid can be complicated because you
do need a RAID controller so you need an
actual logic board if you want to have
any kind of reliable raid 5 or raid 6
okay so you need that you need highly
recommended you need identical drives so
raid works best when you have all the
same hard drives so that they all
perform exactly the same and so you
don't have any weird issues like with
your WD greens dropping out of the raid
array or onedrive performing better than
the other one or ones I'm performing
slower than the other one dragging down
the performance of the whole array Drobo
you don't have to worry about that
because rather than using a standard
type of raid it actually uses their
proprietary non raid but also redundant
backup so what that means is that it
protects you from drive failure much
like rate but it doesn't use a standard
rate so you just pop in whatever old
drives you want whether you want to mix
up capacities you want to mix up
manufacturers you want to mix up speed
bins none of that matters you just throw
in whatever you please and Drobo will
automatically balance the storage
between the drives to provide you
redundant storage so safe storage as
well as convenient storage now the other
thing that drove Oh does really well and
we will of course be doing a full
episode on this is protects from data
loss so if any one of those drives fails
it will notify you and all you have to
do is replace the drive it'll rebuild
itself and take care of you that way
durable is also scalable in a way that
RAID isn't really RAID you usually have
to get everything you want unless you're
not talking about very expensive rape
cards like hardware RAID cards you'd
have to have everything you want at for
your storage pool you have to add it all
at the same time and then you're pretty
much kind of locked in Drobo you buy one
of these you buy one driver I'd
recommend two drives at least you buy
two drives and then as the sweetspot
changes for cost per gigabyte in terms
of hard drive capacity you can add
drives that are higher capacity and less
expensive in order to extend the drive
as you go so you might buy it with two
one terabyte drives now while hard
drives are expensive due to the shortage
and then as prices go down you might add
a two terabyte and then you go okay I'm
out of storage now add a three terabyte
and so on and so forth so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the Drobo S
don't forget to subscribe
not only to Linus tech tips but also to
NCIX tech tips for more content like
this as well as more content about this
and check this out there's a handy
little guide there all the drives have
their own indicator LEDs which tell you
what's going on nothing system healthy
add a drive here soon
cool don't remove this drive because
it's balancing data add a drive here and
drive failure replace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
