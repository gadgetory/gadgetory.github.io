social media and YouTube things like our
Norco cabinet here and our surveillance
server and our other servers and all
that stuff
people have been hounding me what are
you actually going to do a tour of the
server room and it's finally here I've
been putting it off and putting it off
and putting it off because I keep making
little changes and upgrades and tweaks
but it's at the point now where
everything is pretty much up and running
so today I'm going to be putting some
finishing touches on it in terms of
cable management and well actually
closing up the side of the cabinet here
and giving you guys a tour of all the
equipment that we've got in the Linus
media group server closet
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology and RGB
lighting to match your setup check out
the link in the video description to
learn more so I want to start by
responding to one of the criticisms
people had of our server room when I
first started posting pictures on social
media and that was that we didn't have
any backup power as the savvy among you
will know it's extraordinarily important
really for any machine but especially
for a server to not lose power
unexpectedly so a UPS and in fact we
actually do have a number of them for
total in the cabinet here a UPS not only
acts as a battery backup in the event
that there's a sudden power loss to the
building it also acts to smooth out the
incoming power which is good for the
well the life expectancy of any of the
hardware that is hooked up to it so
there is one issue though the ones we've
got here were refurb units that were
sponsored by General Electric and it
turned out that we had some issues with
the batteries in some of them the good
news though I've got my three
replacements right here ready to install
ah yeah so while I'm pulling these out I
guess I'll give a bit of an explanation
for how the the room came to be number
one originally there were actually
supposed to be two cabinets in here one
full height and one half height right
next to it so I thought I could just
kind of set and forget the back of it
and then not worry too much well I have
needed access to the back of this server
cabinet pretty much every other day this
is my brilliant system right now for
controlling any of these computers I got
my monitor down there I got my keyboard
mouse here soap so this is ridiculous so
I learned a couple of things number one
is that the 24 you cabinet that I have
out there is never coming in here and
number two I need a better system for
using a monitor keyboard and mouse on
these servers so this is a trend net
something-or-other KVM and this was sent
to us by RAC solutions.com to hold a
keyboard and mouse and well mount them
and tuck them away so I'll show you guys
that in a minute
the one thing that did thankfully work
out was the cooling solution for the
room I had originally planned to not
hook it up to the air conditioning this
passive air intake and that ducted fan
up there actually replaces the air in
this room about once per minute and it
has turned out to be just fine
thankfully so with the construction
going on while we were moving in as you
can imagine dust in this room has been a
freaking nightmare I have taken every
single one of these servers out three
times since first installing them and
dusted them and I'm probably going to
have to do it once more in the future
I'm going to put some kind of a filter
on this and along the bottom of the door
but in the meantime now it's not nearly
as bad now that the construction is no
longer going on in the warehouse outside
and now that we've sealed the concrete
floor Oh
so with the new UPS is installed in
order to minimize downtime for those
guys in there while I switch all the
systems over to it I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm gonna get my KVM set up first
before I mount this to the wall this is
really cool it's got a little magnetic
closing thing on the top it goes onto
the wall a little something like that
comes with some mounting hardware
keyboard mouse and yeah all that's left
is to make sure it fits yes we're good
maybe I have to use deep scan mode there
should be a stud next to the
I need to know where it is okay well
fine I'm just going to go with drywall
screws because this is already too much
work so that is going to be pretty tight
my friends pretty tight indeed all right
don't tell me I hit a stud awesome the
hell what are the odds I went to mount
the is this thing with all drywall
screws and I hit wood all four times so
I don't need them at all so I'm just
putting the wood screws right in all
right now let's double-check the door oh
so tight awesome my good buddy Taryn
here asked me however shall you keep the
keyboard in place when you close the
door surely that will happen to which I
replied they thought of that this my
friends is a strip of
industrial-strength velcro
you're not gonna filter them out
no I'm not going to velcro the mouse
down but haha so cool all right so now
Oh
oh crap let's try that again ah there we
go
look at that there's little cable
management holes I can take my mouse
wire and keep it in place with this not
too shabby
okay so next step then monitor mount
okay well this old samsung seems to work
so I guess we'll uh we'll go with this
puppy okay so the first thing we need to
do is take it Inc off the included stand
we could also look at the instructions
put the thing on the thing for like this
alright now we gonna wall mount this
puppy okay I guess right about there
- media group we put the ball in and
eyeball it all right let's see if we
managed to stay in the drywall this time
the heck oh you tripped the breaker
oh yeah whoa maybe this is like standard
practice maybe it's plywood behind this
whole thing I'm just not aware of that
okay I think it's just fine back there
that's cool so now this baby goes on
there for the final step
you put the monitor on just kidding guys
oh wait
I did do it upside-down
yeah yes it's amazing they even let me
have power tools I even thought to
myself when I was test fitting it wow
it's really weird that they have you put
the hooks on the bottom and then put the
thumb screw in on the top it seems like
it'd be a lot easier if you think the
other way around
oh alright so the next step is to figure
out how and where to mount our kvms okay
so that's interesting the issue is that
these are not going to make it around to
the backs of these computers unless I
take this side cover off on the other
side which which is an option I think I
think I'm gonna do that there's a zip
tie on there there you go we're good so
this is just gonna come off and go with
the other one that I also have not ever
put on yet oh yeah I just hold this here
you know what let's plug into the main
storage server how high works so now all
that's left is to finalize the position
for this puppy these this is supposed to
go in the rack but I didn't want to take
up any rack space with it cuz as you can
see it's fairly limited at this point so
I was thinking I'll just put them on
this way but the holes pretty much don't
line up at all I can only do one at a
time so we're gonna try that we're gonna
hope for the best this thing isn't too
heavy we'll see how it goes is your KVM
earthquake safe mine's not wish I'd
gotten a drill get on my level now looks
uncomfortable doesn't it
getting on my level oh thank goodness
okay realistically that's not going
anywhere
so now I'm gonna run around and plug all
this stuff in and then I'm gonna let
everyone know that the servers are going
to be down for a little bit so uh hang
tight right about yeah yeah okay so we
can actually check all of them okay cool
all right so the KVM solution totally
works all that's left now is to shut
everything down do some cable management
and I'll get you guys a tour of exactly
what everything in the rack is uh hey
can you guys save your work we're gonna
have a network outage for about 20
minutes everyone likes it when I work on
the server room all right
let's go shutdown so I'm going to get a
call from the security company telling
us that our security system is shut down
wow it is astonishing how much quieter
it is in here
with none of these systems running so
let's get the set up of doom the crap
out of here
oh so frustrating so I moved a bunch of
these power squids in here and now I
need them out and we just got to do a
little bit of cable management back here
and then we're actually in a pretty good
shape what is this
perhaps it is important what can you
unplug it why are you sure yeah
okay so that goes there then this goes
here meet oh oh son of them cable
management you want it done nicely or do
you want it done fast I'll shoot no
don't turn on not now okay um Oh balls
okay things are turning on randomly now
so that it's gonna go right there uh yes
it's okay I am just uh I'm just plugging
it back in now oh shut up I need a
longer cord all right let's power on all
the ups one two
okay that is too long for where it's
running to what the crap is this
there we go
okay so I think we're gonna call the
front good enough she does close except
for this cable that I have running out
of the room to allow the LAN show but
what are you
oh yeah that's another that's another
one that runs up the room yeah so we'll
fire Fraser back up next I guess the
vault is ready to come back up
the surveillance system is back up so
now that we've got everything pretty
much good to go I do need a better
solution for some of these ethernet
cables running out the front door but
we're calling it good enough for now
I'll walk you guys through everything
that's in here so this is our MRV this
is provided by our Internet service
provider they figured it'd cost
somewhere in the neighborhood of $40,000
fortunately we don't have to buy that we
just lease it these are the terminations
for all of our cat 6a wiring throughout
the entire building yes we are full cat
6a even where it doesn't make any sense
thanks to a small miscommunication
between my wife and the builders this is
our Cisco router which we will actually
be replacing because this puppy is a
little bit difficult for us to configure
since none of us are Cisco certified and
you got to do it all of you at command
line and because it's a little bit older
and underpowered for the gigabit that's
one thousand up one thousand down
connection that we have in here so we'll
be replacing this with a PF sense blocks
fairly shortly this is our 48 port
gigabit switch with a couple of 10
gigabit SFP+ ports over here this is our
10 gigabit switch this is the the heart
of most of the servers and the editing
den where everyone has a 10 gig Ethernet
connection hmm
this right here is the surveillance
server which you've seen before it's
chock-full of WD purple drives a seuss
WS board all that kind of reliable
awesome stuff this is our first UPS so
this handles most of the networking gear
and then this is our 24 SSD server it
has 24 960 gig Kingston SSDs in here in
raid 50 so this is a raid 5 this is a
raid 5 this is a raid 5 and they are all
striped together from within windows
this does most of our file server duties
for any of the projects that we're
working on it is equipped with an ass
Rock motherboard it's next 99 board but
we threw a Xeon and ECC memory in there
anyway because it's a workstation board
that does support those particular parts
it's got a redundant power supply in it
now
was something that I didn't get around
to till quite a bit later and it's got
dual ten gigabit ethernet onboard so
this is one that actually has a trunk
connection so it's capable of 20 gigabit
per second with multiple people hitting
it at the same time this right here is a
Newton server this is our aprox I think
it's about a hundred and eighteen
terabytes or something like that this is
the vault the archival server whenever
we're done working on something it goes
off of Wanek and on to the vault this
one only has a single ten gigabit
connection because frankly we don't need
to access it that often and this this is
the really fun machine I'm going to have
a full video on the way that this server
has completely changed our video editing
workflow in the near future here but
this is fraser server it has dual 18
cores he owns 128 gigs of ram to tighten
blacks and oh yeah it's actually at
through a raid card and about a 20
terabyte raid array in there now as well
so what happens here is whenever we
ingest footage it crunches it and makes
it easier to work on then when we're
done our videos this crunches them to
the finished formats that we upload to
the various video sites that we upload
to and this is a very cool little piece
of machinery and it's the only one that
actually extends outside the room so
this is the workstation that's actually
hooked up through Thunderbolt
U and USB 3 to that server in the room
and what we do here is we take all of
our media so you can see we've got this
fancy-pants Thunderbolt
card reader we've got an active star
tech USB 3 cable leading to this
Thermaltake dual drive dock and I'm
actually going to pick up another one of
those so that we can have quite a few
SSD docks on our fs700
and our Blackmagic Cinema cameras all
shoot onto SSD and then we've got this
Cal digit Thunderbolt breakout box here
that we use to run our peripherals and
then we're using a pass through to a
DisplayPort monitor so this is where we
actually interface directly with that
machine in that video will be coming
hopefully some time pretty soon because
we made some pretty amazing discoveries
with respect to video editing workflows
and
how they can be improved so simply put
