x6 1090 T Black Edition and now I'm
going to be doing it's little brother
the x6 1055 T this is not a Black
Edition processor but it's not a you
know purple not as strong addition
process or either this is still a 6 core
processor it's clocked a little bit
slower than the ten nine eighty at 2.8
gigahertz and up to three point three
gigahertz in turbo core mode so that
means that when you're running anywhere
from one to three software threads it's
going to clock three CPUs with the okay
three cores up to three point three
gigahertz and then it'll take the other
three and clock them down in order to
stay within the thermal specifications
that AMD set out for this processor okay
so like they're saying here it's a true
six core design with nine Meg's of total
cache it uses socket am3 which means
that it is a drop-in replacement this is
one of the most impressive things about
this processor into existing am3
motherboards so it has support for both
ddr2 and ddr3 and there are supposedly
over a hundred boards at launch that
with just a BIOS update they will
support the brand new six core
processors AMD has really done a
terrific job with their engineering team
making sure that their new processors
will work in their old boards so the ten
55t includes the same heatsink by
default as the ten ninety you can see it
uses a copper slab at the bottom it's
got heat pipes soldered if you want more
details on the heatsink I guess you
could watch the other video it's got
fins here and it has a sixty millimeter
fan that's pretty much all there is to
really say about it next we have AMD's
documentation oh and we have a phenom 2
case badge very nice I like it okay then
we have AMD certificate of authenticity
as well as their warranty terms and we
have insta how to recognize AMD sockets
that's pretty useful so they show you
everything from socket 754 up to socket
F 1207 all right if we unfold this
you'll see that we have an installation
guide for how to install the CPU and the
heatsink so here's the 1 4 a.m. 2 a.m. 2
plus and am 3/8 steps
pretty straightforward if you've ever
installed a cpu before you shouldn't
have too much trouble with it and
now let's have a look at the CPU itself
I apologize for going through a little
bit quickly on this one but the
cameraman has an important social event
that he has to attend so I don't want to
I don't want to keep him for too much
longer here so here is the Phenom 2 X 6
955 t I will did I say 955 I meant 1055
t I will actually be doing an
overclocking guide featuring this exact
processor where I take the sample that I
received and turn it all the way up to 4
gigahertz 6 threads so stay tuned for
that
here is your am-3 socket with I believe
it's nine hundred and forty-one pins as
I recall and thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the AMD Phenom 2 x6 six
core processor this is the 1050 5t</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
