optimized for silent operation click now
to learn more wha welcome to my unboxing
of the a soos x79 deluxe yes they have
changed their naming scheme which isn't
the only thing that they've changed
about this x79 board its LGA 2011 which
means it's not going to work with the
latest Haswell processors but it will
work with the latest ivy bridge-e
processors so that is quad core and six
core processors on the 2011 platform
even the all-new 49 60 X Extreme Edition
so what makes the new X 79 deluxe
different from the older p9 X 79 deluxe
well mostly it comes down to updating
the feature set because there's actually
been a couple of board technology
refreshes on the consumer side so that
is on the LGA 1150 X line of boards
since Asus originally launched the p9 X
79 deluxe it's gotten a little bit long
in the tooth
they are also adding improve also
implemented specific optimizations for
Ivy bridge-e to make sure that their
newer refresh board works a little bit
more optimally with the new processors
than the older boards because quite
frankly you know when you were building
a board you know a couple years ago you
didn't necessarily have the knowledge to
optimize it for a processor that isn't
gonna be released for a very long time
so without further ado here's everything
that is in the box we get 10 SATA cables
5 right-angle 5 straight we get a
flexible SLI bridge this is a Channel
series board so you don't get the sexy
black SLI bridge it's got an i/o plate
it's got their cue connectors it's also
got ah yes another updated feature so
wireless AC just like the z87 boards and
bluetooth 4.0 it's also got this funny
it comes with an ROG 3-way SLI bridge
though because they get probably didn't
have like an ugly 3-way SLI bridge
because most people don't run 3-way SLI
unless they want like you know sexy
bridge on it also has a user's manual
that's funny there's no disk in here I
wonder if that's because Asus just
stop bothering cuz you might as well
download the latest or if maybe this is
a reviewer board so it didn't include a
disc cuz they know but I'll just
download the latest all right now the
board itself just like the z87 boards
it's been updated with their new black
and gold color scheme which on this
particular one actually looks quite
sharp the power delivery system not only
looks better but it's also been
completely overhauled with superior
performing components including new
inductors new mosfet and driver power
stages and I mean this is important
because as Intel moves the manufacturing
process down so going from sandy
bridge-e to Ivy bridge-e operating
voltage goes down so tolerances actually
get tighter as you go they've also added
their new T topology so new DRAM
topology which basically amounts to how
the traces are connected to the pins on
the CPU because that's where the memory
controller is these days for better
performance now when you couple that
with the fact that Ivy bridge-e has a
much stronger memory controller than
sandy bridge-e you should be seeing
better memory speeds on this platform
than you got on previous edition boards
and running the previous edition
processors in terms of the overall
layout we've got our 8 pin connector
it's ideal location along the top left
we've got our 24 pin connector on the
top right edge in its ideal location the
mem ok button is also here this is
important if you're running sort of high
spec memory and you want to make sure
that it posts long enough to actually
set up the memory the way you want it to
run just in case it doesn't post it's
less of an issue these days but it's
good to have just in case you've also
got your USB 3 front panel connector and
it's optimal location but I would prefer
to see a right angle connector if they
could arrange that
well SATA ports ok so two of which are
say two three six gigabit per second
running off the Intel controller four of
which are say two to three gigabit per
second running off the Intel at the
controller and the rest of them are
running off of a new generation
third-party controller so asus is using
one that has a PCIe gen 2 link which
means better overall throughput
it also supports their latest SSD
caching which allows an unlimited size
SSD to cache your mechanical storage
which is great because intel rst only
allows up to a 60 gig SSD for that in
fact you can even use three separate
SSDs to cache your mechanical volumes
which is
very very cool so there's a lot of
connectivity options here you've also
got your front panel connectors as well
as an EP you switch so remember that's
the processor that allows for a better
power consumption for the system as well
as TPU which allows for maybe not quite
as good power consumption but higher
performance you've got four USB 2.0
front panel headers a clear CMOS switch
as well as their direct key which is
actually super handy it when the system
is turned off you just press it and then
it boots up directly into the UEFI so
you can make any changes you want on
board reset and power switches as well
as a post indicator which makes this a
pretty feature-rich board even from an
overclocking or operating outside of a
case standpoint which isn't necessarily
its intended market the PCI Express
Lanes are distributed in pretty much the
normal way so there's no funny switching
going on with you know plx switches or
anything like that so basically what you
see is what you get remember there's 40
lanes available and with the new ivy
bridge-e cpus in an optimized board and
optimized components you can run at pcie
3.0 speed so the top one is a PCIe 16x
slot followed by a 1x a 16 X that is
wired for 8 a 16 X 10 is wired for a -
16 X set of wire for 16 and a 1x so the
way that these are going to run is they
can run in 16 X 16 X in the gray slots
or can split up to 8 X 8 X 8 X 8 X if
you wanted to run a four-way SLI
crossfire configuration however the bad
news about that is because of the
spacing it's not really optimized for it
it's only got six PCI expansion slots
and because most cards these days are
dual slot even if you install water
blocks on them there's not a whole lot
that can be done about it they're using
an updated USB 3 controller so speaking
of USB 3 it's got 6 USB 3 ports on the
back and what that allows is you ASP
operation even in Windows 8 the older
boards only supported us PU ASP in
Windows 7 or just the regular turbo mode
in Windows 8 with that said you ASP does
perform a little bit better than turbo
you can go back we did an old and cix
tech tips about it but it's not that
noticeable of the difference and both of
them are better than running in the
default configuration it also has four
USB 2.0 ports include at home 4 USB 2.0
ports 2
Ethernet ports including a new Intel NIC
so it's the latest iSeries controller
which gives you better throughput
reduced CPU utilization all that usual
stuff you'd expect as well as their
network I control which you can control
through AI suite my personal experience
with it isn't that great but in theory
it allows you to prioritize traffic
depending on what is more important to
you there is there ya BIOS flash back
button which allows you to flash the
BIOS even if the board is pretty much
bricked to eSATA port so that brings the
total say to connectivity up to 14 the
dual antennas for the wireless AC and
Bluetooth 4.0 as well a 7.1 audio out
and optical audio out so what does all
this mean in real terms that was a lot
of specs and a lot of improvements but
what is it amount to well you get a more
updated feature set so you've got fan
expert 2 which allows you to have full
granular control of all of the fan
headers through the software whether
you're plugging in 3 pin or 4 pin fans
in fact there are six fan headers 1 2 3
4 5 &amp;amp; 6 located all around the board you
get there of course most modern UEFI
implementation and you get just
generally better overall operations so
asus is saying that the auto-tuning
which actually is excellent their boards
auto-tuning is outstanding it's better
than a OneTouch overclock that just
loads a profile it actually runs through
and Tunes the different components
they're saying with their Auto tuning
they're seeing overclock surround up to
4.6 4.7 gigahertz and Ram overclocks up
to 2133 running 64 gig configurations or
up to 2400 megahertz in lower density
configurations this is all automatic
tuning so there you go it's tuned better
especially for Ivy bridge-e it's the ex
79 deluxe from Asus don't forget to
subscribe to Ana's tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos leave a like if you liked the
video leave a dislike if you disliked it
and leave a comment if you think that JJ
was probably watching this video and
figured that I probably missed something
about his board and is gonna send me an
