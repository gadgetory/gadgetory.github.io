unboxing of the OCZ
is stealth extreme a 500 watt power
supply so the biggest difference between
the stealth extreme and the game extreme
line of power supplies for OCZ is the
fact that the stealth extremes do not
have an LED fan they just have a black
fan okay I don't think they actually run
quieter but the game extremes run like
quite quiet anyway so I don't think it's
gonna be that big of a deal in terms of
standout features on this particular
unit we've got silent operation okay so
they have power whisper technology blah
blah blah runs quiet thank you very much
then we have active PFC which is great
superior cooling EMI isolated casing and
hassle free warranty now the warranty is
one of the biggest things for any OCC
product because OCC really does take
that whole hassle-free warranty think
seriously before I worked at before I
worked at NCIX when I was actually
having to deal with them once as a
customer I had I believe it was a Power
Team 521 and the warranty replacement
for that was so easy that I was sold for
for life in terms of how how good they
are at dealing with any warranty claims
so I had a bit of a problem with it I
sent it in to them they sent me back a
game Xtreme 700 watts so they did a
really great job for me that was a few
years back at this point anyway let's
have a look at what we got inside here
it's a pretty basic package actually in
terms of power supplies but it's quite
an inexpensive power supply so you
expect that a little bit first of all
you've got a little manual ok showing
you how to install it giving you some
idea of the pin outs of all the major
connectors on the power supply unit
itself protection ok safety troubles and
some troubleshooting tips great then
you've got an AC power cord okay that's
terrific it's quite flexible actually
feels kind of nice that's great ok and
then getting down to my boy yet we got 5
screws oh that's terrific even if you
lose one you will still have enough
screws to plug the power supply into or
to connect the power supply to New York
case alright so here we will fine
the power supply unit itself it's a
fairly basic unit once again like I said
before so it's not modular or anything
like that and you don't find a huge
number of connectors we've got the
little do not eat beg don't eat it all
right and then here we go so pretty
plain black housing on this unit if I
could get the bubble wrap off that would
be terrific okay so there we go we've
got a pretty plain black housing it
actually uses a two rail design for the
12 volt rail which combined for 36 amps
total so 18 amps on each 12 volt rail
and you can see that together the two
12-volt rails are good for 480 1.5 watts
of the total 500 Watts that this power
supply can provide so it's quite 12 volt
rail heavy which is great and any modern
power supply it should have that as a
feature now at the back you can see
we've got quite a typical honeycomb
design mean popular BIOS easy a number
of years ago
you've got no 120 or 240 switch which is
quite typical of a power supply of this
type you got an on/off switch then
you've got more black more black and a
black fan which I didn't mention before
oh this is kind of an interesting
sticker to keep warranty please do not
remove so they don't want you taking the
casing off it really you shouldn't be
opening any power supply period because
if you're opening a power supply you are
opening up a can of danger this is not
meant to be user serviceable on the
inside if you have any problems you
should contact ocz for their legendary
warranty support anyway now in terms of
connectors there is not a whole lot to
talk about so you've got your standard
20+4 pin or 24 pin ATX connector then
you've got if I can find it a 4 pin
connector ok so that's we're like your
p4 connector okay then you've got a
single 6 plus 2 pin PCI Express
connector then you've got 2 molex here
we've got two more molex and a floppy
connector here and then only three SATA
cables on this particular unit as I said
fairly basic thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the OCZ stealth extreme
500 watt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
