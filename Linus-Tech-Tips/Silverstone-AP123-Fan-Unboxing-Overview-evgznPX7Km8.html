for their fans silverstone this is the
AP 123 I mean honestly these guys
probably spend more money and more
energy engineering their fans than
almost anyone else out there I mean
everyone in their dog manufacturers a
fan where basically they're taking some
OEM fan made by yeat loon or whoever
else and they're slapping a label on it
they're having it made to us back with
some LEDs or whatever else Silverstone
actually engineers fans the AP 123 is an
evolutionary step forward in their air
penetrator series although it seems to
be not called air penetrator anywhere
but I'm assuming the AAP is because it's
sort of similar in terms of the
technology and the original air
penetrator was designed for focused air
flow and you can see that this one has
the same air flow focused channels on
the back of it that the old one did the
key difference between this one and the
old air penetrator I actually use a p1
21s the original air penetrators on my
radiator in my system because the
undervolt extremely well they're very
quiet and the focused airflow allows
them to draw air through the radiator
and then push it out the back of my case
because there's a bit of a dead zone
between the outer the grill on the other
side and the other side of the fan so
it's cool because it makes the air flow
not just through my radiator more
effective but also the airflow through
my case more effective so with the AP
123 what Silverstone has done so for a
first of all so general specs blue UV
blades black frame got it
that's a nice UV blue too on the old AP
120 ones it's kind of a translucent one
this should look quite striking ah five
volt DC start voltage outstanding if
you're using DC control for your fans
it's nice that they'll start at such a
low voltage that means you can even
instead of using under bolting adapters
or whatever else you can make your own
adapters just by running the fan off the
seven and 12 volt instead of a 12 in
ground so you have a 5 volt difference
not that I necessarily recommend making
your own electric adapters but whatever
up to 1500 RPM although it'll go
significantly lower than that if you
under volt it lifetime of 50,000 hours
excuse me sorry fairly solid static
pressure rating and whatever so taking
air channeling fan to another level I
wish they'd had someone proofread this
industry-leading air channeling fan and
the AAP certainly was when it launched
so I'm sure they're sort of keeping this
going integrated air channeling grill
doubles as a fan guard to reduce the
overall size which is nice and let's
finally get into what makes this fan
super special check this out see this
right here
what silverstone discovered is that in
order to reduce the noise you want to
reduce the the patterned nist you wanna
you want to break up the in order to
reduce sort of humming noises and any
kind of vibration you want to break
things up a little bit you want to you
want things to be different so they have
three different sizes of fan blades on
this fan I'm gonna let you guys look for
it okay Brod three of those medium three
of those it's small this makes the fan
according to silverstone so you can see
they're also completely different shapes
so this looks more like the blade on the
original AP this looks more like a
standard fan blade but with a bit of a
bit of a curvature up at the end here
and this one is quite curved at the end
so this is supposed to make the fan
better optimized for silence and
performance while just sort of generally
also being awesome and directing airflow
through your case I mean when it comes
to directed airflow it's useful for a
number of things so I would use directed
airflow fans wherever you need to not
only dryer through something but also
towards something so for example a great
place to use it would be if you have a
case where I'm gonna stand this way if
you have a case where the front intake
is here and then you've got your
harddrive cages and then you've got more
fan mounts like something like a Corsair
C 70 I would mount something like this
on the other side of those cages because
now I have a pressure optimized fan to
draw air through the restrictive cages
then I have channeled airflow going
directly to my graphics cards that's
where the utilize that's where the
application of a fan like this is they
are including a nice high quality
sleeving so even though the wires
themselves are colored you can't
actually see the colors through this
leaving at all which is great there we
go and they include both screws and
noise isolating vibration isolating
rubber drum
to melt the fancy piece so that pretty
much wraps it up thank you for checking
