cool this looks like a fairly simple
problem to solve right
I mean Intel doesn't even include copper
slugs in the middle of their hunk of
aluminum heatsinks anymore so why is it
then that we pay actual money to cool
our processes I mean in the case of the
stock one I guess you don't really pay
for it it comes in the box for nothing
but maybe you broke it or something
so today's mission is to build our own
cooling heatsink
I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
gaming laptops feature Intel seventh
generation core i7 processors check them
out at the link below so with the
mission of creating our very own - tech
tips heatsink I set off for a discussion
with the linus media group engineering
and stuffed animal taxidermy division
they went away for a couple of days and
then returned proudly proofing a hacksaw
a block of aluminum and a stack of
papers full of pictures of Elon Musk
over which in crayon it said just raw
doggin at which point I really began to
wonder what exactly it is that I paid
these people for and got to work again
so the basic principle of an aluminum
heatsink is actually pretty
straightforward you've got this little
heat generating doodad right here and
you need to take that heat and you've
got to spread it out then you've got to
dissipate it to the air so what you need
is a thermally conductive material so
the engineering department did manage to
get that far we've got a hunk of
aluminum which has excellent thermal
conductivity and then what you need is
you have to increase its surface area so
if all we did was take this and stick it
on top of a CPU what we'd effectively do
is we would spread the heat but we would
spread it throughout this block without
actually achieving any of our cooling
goals so once we've got this spreading
the heat we've got to increase the
surface area and the way that apparently
they intend for me to do that I mean at
least they have the decency to get a
fresh blade for the hacksaw is to throw
the block in the vise and just start
sawing out since I've been informed that
this is the good one whatever that means
so we're going to do a practice cut on
this other hunk of aluminum see just how
accurate we can get here
the more thins and the thinner the
better okay unless we have all the time
in the world and we assign absolutely
zero value to it that's clearly not a
way to go about it so back to the
engineering department they brainstormed
and came up with a new solution let's
arm Linus with power tools so I've never
used a reciprocating saw boom and it's
plugged in but it looks really fun so
safety first kids exciting wd-40 on here
Wow
we made as much progress in like four
seconds as we did before okay that's not
so hard she see the real thing this is
my like ten minutes of hacksaw
there's my like 10 seconds of reciprocal
sign okay screw it yeah okay how many
blades did you say we have unplug the
change the blade have a lot more respect
for what coolermaster dos I think that
what we really need is like a constant
flow of wd-40 unless we are definitely
making faster progress now so not having
not trying to cut the entire thing it
once keeps the blades from getting
filled up with metal it would be really
careful when we have one blade like
almost there got to finish up one last
one so we found that this stuff by fluid
film actually does a better job of
lubricating the blade which was then
great to know because it's just
generally a lot less nasty than wd-40
that's the stuff that smells by the way
almost there
holy crap I think the only thing more
epic than the DIY heatsink we've created
ah is the mess that we've created I mean
this is like I don't know if it's like a
pound of aluminum but boy howdy is it
ever a lot of aluminum I guess you
better clean this up look at it
oh there's wd-40 all over it the stuff
is hard to pick up okay we are actually
getting pretty close to being ready to
try out mounting this baby after a
little bit of washing and a little bit
of filing just to take some of the
really rough edges off of it so we don't
hurt ourselves while we're working on it
we are going to devise some kind of
mounting system now that's the kind of
thing that you're probably thinking to
yourself gee Linus surely you guys
thought of that before you started to
which I would reply it can't be that bad
right yes my friends it zipped hi time
again so we're going to throw on our
usual icy diamond thermal compound we
are going to plonk that bad boy down on
there and we are going to figure out how
does it tie it on let's get some hot
glue going on here to a Linus tech tips
project is truly not complete without
hot glue so in terms of mounting for
this puppy just going to kind of going
to kind of Yolo it I mean are you really
expecting anything else
there we go okay so the hot glue fan is
on if we ran this through the holes on
the fan it was Albert Einstein who said
that there's a fine line between idiot
and genius promise again be full of a
she said no such thing stuff
what's the crap what kind of cheapest
zip-tie breaks just like that let me get
these from so generic so this is it
moment of truth time well toast that's a
good sign see two temperatures sitting
at 25 degrees we've got I too loaded up
let's get our sensors going here idle
temperature is not bad and it's not like
the fan is working really hard either
check this out Chavez oh it's just
barely spinning do that let's go ahead
and hit it well a threat pack CPU
package is sitting at 74 degrees but I
think we've leveled off success for $3
worth of aluminum and a fan that we
found some old 80 millimeter Silverstone
fan we were able to
okay hold on a minute so it's been
running for about eight minutes now and
the victory is less complete than we at
first thought so there's some good stuff
to take away here we're still running
above the base speed of the i7 6700 K
but we are not turbo boosting to the max
anymore so you can see we're actually
getting some cpu throttling and
overheating detected here our CPU
packages up around 98 degrees Celsius
and if you put your hands on the
heatsink it is pretty toasty but the
computer doesn't turn off it does run so
there you have it we did what we set out
to do we make our own heatsink is it as
good as the one that Intel puts in the
box know what Intel doesn't put a heat
sink in the box for their unlocked K
series processors anymore so this if you
have an unlimited amount of time and
enough money to buy literally a power
tool just to make it but for some reason
not enough money to just buy heatsink
okay we don't know what the point of it
was but it was fun wasn't it even the
name VPN makes browsing the internet
privately and in a more open manner
sound kind of like techie and difficult
but with tunnel there it is so easy
they've got applications for Android iOS
Mac PC even a Chrome extension and it
makes it as simple as pressing one
button and then boom your connection
gets encrypted with AES 256-bit
encryption and oh by the way tunnel bear
does not log any of your activity and it
changes up the location that you appear
to be browsing the internet from so
online websites and services will think
you're someone else from somewhere else
but don't take my word for it you guys
can try it out for nothing by heading
over to tom bear comm slash ltte where
when you sign up for an unlimited
account you can save 10% woo
