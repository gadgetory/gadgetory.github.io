again and this time no sticky stuff I've
got a better way to charge a better way
to communicate a better way to cool and
a better way to dongle let's do it
be quiet silent wings three used a
smooth-running 6-pole motor to remain
silent and better cool your pc check
them out of the link below number one is
the antlion mod mic 5 a boom style
microphone that can attach to any pair
of headphones turning them into a very
capable and modular headset for 70 bucks
this way you get to keep your audiophile
grade headphones that you'd prefer to
listen to instead of resorting to
clipping a mic to your clothes
putting a desktop microphone in front of
you or switching to a gaming headset all
of which might not be ideal solutions
for a variety of unsurprising reasons
there are good gaming headset options
like the ath ag1 from Audio Technica but
spending that kind of money doesn't make
a lot of sense if you already have
awesome headphones that you personally
like and you don't want to lose their
sound signature
which can be annoying of course if it
sucked we wouldn't bother talking about
it but now in its fifth generation the
mod mic does sound great though I don't
expect you to take my word for it I'm
going to read the rest of this paragraph
on a handful of competing solutions once
the base is attached to your headphones
you can clip it on or remove it easily
with its built-in magnet it is a dual
mic capsule with an omnidirectional mic
and a separate uni directional mic a
modular mute switch a cable rack to
protect your wires and simplify your
setup modular cable lengths the right
adapters get you going no matter what
device you have other than I guess an
iPhone 7 although if you have one of
those Bluetooth audio dongle things you
could get it to work with the Y adapter
and there's also Kevlar reinforced
wiring because why not number 2 the
Silverstone 1 to 8 pwm fan hub which is
way cooler than the name makes it sound
yes yes it's just a fan hub but it is a
4 pin PWM so it will support whatever
fans you'd like it looks very sleek and
will go in pretty much any case even
with all the tempered glass that's been
going around lately the cables are an
appropriate length so you won't have a
ton of excess but there also will be
enough to actually plug them in which is
important and it comes with a
some 3m Duloc adhesive strips so you can
put it anywhere in your case that you'd
like no more awkward fan cables running
all around your motherboard searching
for just one more fan header just one
single cable to control the speed and
it's only 12 bucks less than you'd pay
for many premium fans anyways number
three the fin six Dart it's barely under
a hundred bucks but it's really cool
it's a laptop charger that's so small
that when I first saw it I genuinely
asked who's Ashley just for charging
phones and while I can do that with the
integrated 2.1 amp USB port it also
charges laptops in the box you'll get
your dart charger a nice carrying pouch
for everything nine tips for charging a
variety of laptops and a thank you note
for their Kickstarter what a decent
product that I like from Kickstarter ok
that was weird and it gets even more
unbelievable if none of the included
adapters actually work for you just
email them and they'll send you one that
does for free that's cool now
unsurprisingly it's not that strong at
only 65 watts of output you'll be stuck
with the thinner sleeker selection of
laptops out there if you want full
charging performance but that being said
it does work with laptops that want more
juice like my old Asus bamboo whose
included charger is rated for about 90
watts it will charge just a little bit
more slowly which may be a fair
trade-off while traveling if you're
going to be able to charge overnight and
bag space is at a premium thanks United
last but potentially not least we have
number 4 the XL XL axle whatever it's a
DisplayPort 1.2 to HDMI 2.0 adapter most
graphics cards these days
only have one HDMI port sometimes you
need more sure your monitors probably
take DisplayPort but VR headsets capture
cards TVs and video splitters are almost
always HDMI only big deal Luke there's
like a million of these on Newegg right
ok but if you dig a little deeper into
the specs most of them are HDMI one
point four which means they're limited
to 4k at 30 Hertz instead of 60 Hertz
which means your high-resolution display
will feel laggy and stutter in
everything from games to even basic
desktop use which brings us finally to
the full disclosure part of these handy
tech episodes since they're structured
more as a recommendation to buy with
links below to Amazon versus a review we
like to disclose why we chose these and
how we acquired them I don't want the
Mod Mike 5 was actually sent to us by
antlion for an ad spot we did for them a
little while ago but Linus's always
loved these things and I have two and
this one is just well more to love item
2 the Silverstone 1 to 8 PWM fan hub was
sent by Silverstone for Linus's des PC
project though unfortunately it didn't
arrive in time beef in six Dart Linus
back to this a thousand freaking years
ago and it just arrived a couple weeks
ago item for the Excel DisplayPort to
HDMI adapter was purchased by Linus
personally to solve his decidedly first
world problem of how to connect his 4k
TV and his HTC vive to the 980ti in his
media center PC at the same time alright
