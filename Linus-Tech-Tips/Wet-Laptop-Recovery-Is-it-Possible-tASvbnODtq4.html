DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts so I've gotten
some complaints that we don't do enough
crazy projects anymore now the fact of
the matter is that a lot of the time we
don't plan to do crazy things that you
know our things are broken and stuff it
just kind of happens so it kind of
happened this time
this is my Dell XPS 12 that I've been
using for the last quite a while we were
in the middle of shooting something
yesterday and I kind of ran off this
morning I was running around looking for
it going where the heck is it because it
wasn't at home and I found it on the
porch and unfortunately it rained last
night so this is the state of it this
water is actually dripping out from
inside the notebook now there is an
extremely good chance that this notebook
is completely dead with non
battery-powered devices it's often you
could basically submerge it and then if
you could open it up and completely dry
and make sure there's no residue or
nothing to short it out there's a very
good chance that would live but
something with a battery in it it's
constantly getting power provided to it
so the chances of shorting something out
and destroying it are very good so it
was actually left open like this so the
water it was able to force its way in
through the keyboard so this is I mean
this is a very very rough shape but you
know thousand-dollar notebook you're
still gonna you're still going to take a
shot at fixing it right so I'm pulling
out my eye fix-it kit with my Torx heads
here actually these are a handy new
thing we've got now these nice little
magnetic trays and we're going to do a
sub $100 maybe we might have actually
done it by the time this video is done
but sub $100 handy things and we're
going to highlight those because I think
they're great so I'm going to pull off
the bottom here we'll be back in a
moment all right so this is kind of the
moment of truth we're going to open up
the shell fortunately I don't have an
Apple computer so
comes apart even though it's an
ultrabook type form factor so you can
see the entire inside is absolutely
soaked with water being able to run out
a little bit more freely now but I have
it opened up now one thing that I'm
going to want to do pretty much
immediately here is disconnect the
battery connector I mean the like I said
it's it's probably a done deal at this
point but it still can't hurt to have
the power disconnected unfortunately it
looks like it looks like Dell glues that
in why would they do that Dell what are
you guys doing there is a chance that if
I dry this out completely and replace
the battery that I'll be able to get it
back up and running again but I'm gonna
have to figure out how to get this
connector off first so panic moment
there guys it turns out that water on a
connector that's beaded up kind of looks
like glue so no the battery is not glued
in so what I'm going to do next is pull
the battery out and actually I'm gonna
I'm going to pull it apart as much as I
can without going so far that I lose
track of how it goes back together and
then basically I'm going to put it
somewhere to dry and then we're going to
do the old rice bag technique this is
just a handy sort of do yourself a favor
trick is whenever you're taking
something apart take lots of pictures
because even if you forget one little
detail it can be a major hassle later on
and then one thing that I'm doing is
well is because it's got several
different kinds of screws I am making
sure that that I take pictures of the
heads as well as the threads next to the
place where they come from this just
makes your life a little bit easier when
you're putting it back together you can
see I've got the battery out now and
then I've also got the I'm just I'm just
loosening PCBs so that I can get a
little bit of airflow going through them
and then what I'll do is I'll just set
up a fan to blow on it for now before I
do the rice bag trick later on because
you can't
on the rice to do everything that's more
of more of a finishing move so to speak
so I'm pretty close to having it about
as disassembled as I think I'm going to
get it I was hoping that because of the
way the screen works on this notebook
with this metal border around the top of
it that the screen itself wouldn't have
really gotten any water in it because it
was upright when we started raining but
Luke pointed out to me well hold on a
second surface tension it's going to
come around here and then it's going to
drip onto the screen from this gap in
between where the the model I think they
call it a ferris wheel style convertible
screen so he was right water did get
into the screen so we've got the
carbon-fiber top off now it's really
light carbon-fiber is kind of cool but
the good news though is that because it
comes apart quite easily much like the
rest of this notebook I'm able to open
it up and get at least I mean there's
not much water in here so I'm really not
that concerned about this part and it's
mostly the bottom components here that
I'm worried about so basically what I've
done is I've removed the motherboard
kind of as much as I can you can see
it's quite loose it's only being held in
over here and then I've prized it up a
little bit so that it's going to can get
a little bit more airflow
I'm going to go position this in front
of a fan and cross my fingers I've taken
the SSD out and then in order to speed
things up you can dry things out by
soaking them in alcohol and then letting
that evaporate away so this I need some
data off of so I'm going to go ahead I'm
going to do that with this but I'm going
to give the note put probably a good
solid week before I take another shot at
it so here's my epic set up with got a
three speed fan running here and then
I've got all of my all my parts in my
handy dandy little please focus really
Wow going to be like that okay
my parts tray then I've got the
disassembled notebook taken apart and
opened up as much as possible for
optimal
sort of airing out nests I suspect that
I actually won't need the the rice bag
I'm gonna leave this here for about a
week and then we'll see how it goes I
got things kind of lifted up there yeah
so a funny story I started by putting
the screws in around the outside of the
monitor and I was like now need to put
the heatsink on I need to put the
battery back in let's find out if this
bad boy fires up and then let's go ahead
and invest in all the finishing touches
there so I'm actually at the point now
or the fan and heatsink are back on I
put the SSD back in for a good measure
and it's time to put the battery on
actually I got to put this connector
back on first okay so a moment of truth
time I have latent got every one I did
all the stuff I can do by myself so I'm
going to plug the battery in not going
to bother screwing it in just because
who knows if this is all just a total
waste of time
I plugged this bad boy in here oh my god
not Jesus Christ gah you actually did
scare me there okay should it be making
noise here we go Oh looks like an
activity led up warning battery is
critically low huh whoa here you can
come have a look at the screen here oh
so it powers on the keyboard LEDs are
illuminated the activity LED on the SSD
is going so that means it's not just
completely dumb in there let's uh cool
okay I'm going to turn it off for now
and grab a power adapter and find out if
she boots into an OS wow that's
unbelievable i impressed something
actually happened I was expecting
nothing at all yeah I was expecting
complete dead like damn that's actually
pretty amazing hmm if this thing works
you're never allowed to get another
top you have to continue to upgrade this
laptop forever oops
another side oh yeah sure be gentle with
it okay let's try firing her up again so
I actually i-44 went is that the past
tense of forgo I for went the the rice
treatment because I was impatient so it
sat here for about a week no I mean
which evidently was enough the thing I
don't know yet because the thing that's
most like look at that what why I left
it what oh my god there's my ax 1500 i
unboxing review things unbelievable look
at that it did not even miss a beat
unbelievably unplugged Wow week and
having been soaked that is that's unreal
that is something else look at that so
it remains to be seen how well the
battery held up because that was the big
thing that could have been damaged and
could have lit on fire like it's a
lithium based battery like it could have
been a big problem but it turns out that
it was well enough sealed and the screen
was well enough sealed that we didn't
get much water in there that the
notebook actually works so there you go
guys all is not necessarily lost no
matter how hopeless it looks thank you
