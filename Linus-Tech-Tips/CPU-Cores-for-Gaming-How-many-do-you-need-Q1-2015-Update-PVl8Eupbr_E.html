components and these days people are
starting to focus on other things as
well like power consumption and thermal
output but what about the age-old how
many cores do our need for modern gaming
question as the landscape changed or is
it still quad cores for life like it was
for pretty much a long time but it won't
be Pentium G 32:58 dual core that made a
big splash a while back is that
processors blazing fast over clock
speeds an affordable price point viable
in today's market stay tuned to find out
it stays subscribe for Linus tech tips
for more awesome technology videos
the Coolermaster no-touch tkl utilizes
genuine taupe or hybrid capacitive
switches and is now available at a more
affordable price click now to learn more
the test bench we use to get our numbers
is rocking an Intel 59 60 X overclocked
just a bit to 3.2 gigahertz with 32 gigs
of DDR 4 RAM running at 3,000 megahertz
it's also sporting a win force GTX 980
from gigabyte running at stock and we
went a little bit crazy started
disabling cords and hyper threading and
to simulate various CPUs that are
available for purchase today for testing
we chose to use a dual core without
hyper threading dual core with hyper
threading quad core without hyper
threading quad core with hyper threading
hex core with hyper-threading and
octa-core with hyper threading to round
out our test suite now all right now for
the meat and potatoes we chose a few new
games for our tests we'll start with
those ones first and first on the
chopping block is cities skylines the
benchmark cities we downloaded the Los
Santos map from GTA 5 made bike
Rockefeller on the Steam Workshop we
chose a section in the town called South
Los Santos with mixed traffic and
building density to push the test bench
quite a bit we maxed out the graphics
and zoomed in almost all the way and
then started to record city skylines
likes its CPU cores but only to a
certain point dual cores seem to
struggle a bit more than the rest of
them at least which wasn't too
surprising a workout interesting was at
the 8 core level cities ran a lot more
poorly than actually lower levels and
had very noticeable stuttering
throughout all of our testing a reminder
hover as we did run our tests shortly
after the game came out so optimizations
might be not be made yet and might be
made in the future and could very
drastically change things over time next
up we have dying light we decided to run
it at both 1080p and 4k after we saw the
1080p results to see if we could
separate the numbers a bit more as the
only outlier was really the dual-core
how we ran the benchmark for dying light
was relatively straightforward in the
main town close to the tower there's a
really long overpass near the start of
that is a bus which is near the opening
to the tunnel anyways just run down the
overpass and loop back around while
zigzagging through burning cars and the
undead
we ran our tests after the developers
have released several patches and
optimizations and even at absolutely
cranked settings not much of a
difference really occurs at the higher
end configurations with only the dual
core and dual core with hyper-threading
configurations suffering a bit of a
performance it
our last newcomer to the game sweet but
not our last benchmark is total war
attila for this game we set the
appropriate graphics settings which I
decided was apparently freakin all of
them and then selected the sway zones
historical battle Sweden's wisest so I
don't know and clash the armies together
in one giant ball without speeding it up
we ended up running the benchmark at
every quality preset as you just saw to
see if we could turn different results
out of the game
and it turns out total war attila is
quite the powerhouse throwing more
chords that it does indeed give a bit
more of a performance jump over a
dual-core setup however the amount is
oddly very negligible at lower presets I
will note that this game isn't the
constant FPS of the game these numbers
are only from intense combat sections so
it would run way better when not staring
directly into combat where the twist
comes in is that the maximum performance
preset the numbers are just ridiculous
for this test and make no sense but
average frame rates are super high and
there is no drastic stuttering so if
you're worried about if your machine can
run this game put it on maximum
performance settings and it should be
extremely easy for you to do even with
some older slower processors now that
all the new games are done let's take a
break for some oldies but goodies
the first being tomb raider i know this
game dates back all the way to 2013 but
it's a very reliable benchmark in terms
of GPU scaling so we decided to include
it as it's in lots of our test suites
like dying light we ran Tomb Raider in
both 1080p and 4k and the results were
pretty funny to be honest it doesn't
seem to matter what arrangement of
course you have the game run perfectly
equal like freakishly equal even at 4k I
think in the future we won't leave this
game for GPU tests only our final game
is Far Cry 4 this game is a bit of a
 show and that's why we saved it for
last performance is essentially the same
across 4 6 &amp;amp; 8 core settings regardless
of hyper-threading but as soon as you
drop down to do
course hyper-threading or not the game
flat out refuses to boot at all this is
because Ubisoft locked out all users
that have dual course from launching the
freaking game there is a fixed floating
around that could potentially get it
running but it's a hassle and most
mention of it has been pulled down by
Ubisoft anyways those of you with older
dual cores or the pentium g 32:58
anniversary edition but where is this
could be a pretty big issue for you
honestly the most disappointing thing
about this issue is that from the looks
of it it's easier to fix for pirates
than it is for real paying users which
is highly disappointing yet not at all a
surprising all right I guess that brings
us tidally to the conclusion of this
video which is having more courses nice
and may help with some things like video
rendering or game streaming or whatever
else but you don't need more than a
quad-core for modern gaming and you
would be mostly fine with a quick
dual-core even but what's your sweet
spot let me know in the comments down
below or on the forum I know I like my
higher core account processors because I
tend to be doing a billion things at
once on my computer including running
virtual machines streaming games and
more would you guys be interested in a
course for gaming style video where we
rerun these tests while doing other
things on the computer as well like
possibly streaming or just a whole bunch
of tabs in a browser let me know
speaking of performance our friends over
at Shiro have an awesome high capacity
battery bank that they want us to show
off today it's their power plus three
13400 million power battery bank which
features a nice rounded design and a
slightly sticky texture which allows you
to maintain a solid grip on it
despite the rounded edges like other
cheerin products all of the battery
cells used inside are made by Panasonic
in Japan so you can count on their
high-quality durability and safety and
of course that also facilitates the
great capacity in such a compact size
this battery bank is currently available
for $39.99 on Amazon and if you purchase
one of the first 3,000 units you will
actually receive a 60 centimeter version
of TIROS lightning and micro USB dual
connector cable so if your interest
in a high-capacity battery bank with a
very manageable form factor usually
definitely check out the Chi Rho power
plus three thirteen thousand four
hundred million power in the link in the
video description down below
alright guys while you're here watching
this video like dislike favorite
subscribe share comment do anything else
that has a button around here somewhere
that's probably not a bad idea and then
jump over to the forum but before you
jump over the forum check the link in
the video description below to buy a
cool shirt like this one yes I did it
once you're over on the forum click the
support us link that'll show you how to
do stuff like change your Amazon
affiliate code to ours we get a small
kickback and you can become a
contributor on the forum to get that
awesome cool bronze silver gold badge
and maybe some other stuff anyways thank
you guys for watching I'll see you next
