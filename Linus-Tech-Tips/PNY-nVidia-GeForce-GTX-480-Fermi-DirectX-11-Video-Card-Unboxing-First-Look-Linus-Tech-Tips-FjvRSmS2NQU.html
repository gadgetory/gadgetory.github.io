you can actually click here to see how I
got my GeForce GTX 480 on launch day I
finally have one today I have the PNY
accelerate performance Edition GeForce
GTX 480 these cards are rarer than hen's
teeth but I did manage to get my hands
on one so I'm going to be opening it for
your unboxing pleasure so let's start
with what's on the outside of the box
first of all down at the bottom you can
see that this has 1536 megabytes of
gddr5 memory this is in videos first
video card with gddr5 on the high end
now they actually have a lull in GPU
that uses it but it's not it doesn't
make a difference at that point anyway
so this is the fastest memory card from
Nvidia ever
you've got 3d vision surround so if you
actually have to DT X 480 s you cannot
only run surround with 3 monitors but
you can do it in 3d with the Nvidia 3d
glasses next we have support for physics
in CUDA these are nothing new but
they're still being continued with and
obviously nvidia sli support now let's
oh yeah pin Y also includes 5 free bonus
saw movie downloads from PN why.com
slash movies so you should check that
out that's something that I don't think
anyone else is offering with their GTX
480 on the back we've got the basic
specifications and key features as well
as minimum system requirements so
there's going to be some interesting
stuff in here first of all
specifications can you get a look at
that so that people can just read it and
freeze the frame if they want to is that
good enough let's just call that good
enough ok key features DirectX 11 this
is a videos first DirectX 11 card
everything else here is pretty much
stuff I've already covered at the front
or stuff that's just being carried over
from previous cards minimum system
requirements this one's interesting
because Nvidia actually recommends a
minimum 600 watt or greater system power
supply with a minimum 12 volt current
rating of 42 ms so that means that if
you're running just a bare-bones system
other than that you will need to have at
least one 42 amps on your 12 volt rail
you should be using a modern power
supply with this card if you're not then
that's absolutely crazy alright let's
keep on moving and
contents we'll get to that when we
actually open the contents of the
package so I am breaking the seal on the
GTX 480 here we go
peel that back and there is a paper
sleeve oh no hey check this out hi class
that is a cardboard sleeve not a paper
sleeve you can tell it's a premium card
when okay the next thing we find inside
is a little scrap of paper I'm guessing
that's nothing then we have an
installation CD you should download the
latest drivers often video comm don't
even use this next we have a GeForce
graphics card QuickStart guide from PNY
so let's see they're just showing you
all the different basic kinds of
connectors that you might find on your
video card and they're giving you some
instructions on how to install them in
your case all right Thank You P&amp;amp;Y
for covering that for us next we have a
two molex to one PCI Express 6 pin
adapter although frankly if you don't
have a power supply that has the
required connectors for this then you
should just buy one because you don't
want to be you don't want to be running
something like this with a lousy power
supply if your power supply blows up it
can take a lot of other stuff with it
then we have a mini HDMI to HDMI adapter
so I'll show you why you need that in
just a second and then one DVI to VGA
adapter alright so let's get the foam
off here and let's get this baby opened
there we are so the first thing you
notice about it is that the whole front
of the card I mean this is not a shiny
plastic this is metal this is heatsink
here guys this is one hot card so that
means that you've got all of this extra
surface area that you normally wouldn't
have on a video card dedicated to
dissipating heat with any incidental
airflow that comes over the card not
only that but compared to a TI's Radeon
HD series which I happen to have one of
here you can see that the back panel
uses the full length of the adjacent PCI
slot for cooling and ventilation versus
ATI cutting off half of it alright the
next thing we've got a cable here I told
you I tell you why you need a mini HDMI
connector that's why now you can only
actually can
two of these three at a time so each
card can output to two displays but this
way you can do hdmi and DVI or DVI and
DVI
alright let's go around - why don't we
do the top of the card next those are
thick heat pipes I have never seen a
heat pipe this thick on a stock cooler
for a graphics card not one not two not
three but four heat pipes coming out for
him right over where the GPU core is so
you can see right here that's where that
large GTX 480 chip is and that's where
all of the heat pipes go because really
there's nothing else on here except
maybe the voltage regulators and this
that wow that's actually stuck on there
bizarre except the voltage regulators
that actually needs a lot of cooling so
let's go around to the bottom of the
card this is still a standard PCI
Express - card so that means it's gonna
fit into any PCI Express 1.0 1.1 1.1 a
or PCI Express 2.0 motherboard around
the back you see we find some of the
voltage regulator regulation components
and the rest of them seem to be sitting
down in TC under the fan right there so
those are actually getting direct
airflow right from the fan when it's
spinning and videos using their their
standard kind of fan they've been using
since wow the 8800 series I guess
they've been using this particular
blower fan okay another thing that I
want to point out about this card right
off the bat is that this is again in
line with the power requirements it
requires not only one PCI Express 6-pin
connector not an additional PCI Express
six pin connector but a six pin and an
eight pin PCI Express connector so you
need a serious power supply to run this
card and I think that pretty much does
it for my unboxing oh you know what else
I should mention PNY has actually just
added lifetime warranty to their there
tick boxes on the both sides of their
cards so the geforce gtx 470 and 480
from PNY both feature our lifetime
warranty thank you for checking out my
unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
