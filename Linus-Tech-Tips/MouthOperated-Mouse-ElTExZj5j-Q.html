you couldn't use your hands your first
instinct might be to use your feet maybe
even with a foot controller like the
beacon or the stinky foot board but then
what if you couldn't use your feet
either in that case you might be tempted
to get more creative but fortunately for
the many people out there including many
gamers who struggle to use a
conventional keyboard or mouse there's
another option introducing quad joy a
mouse you control with your mouth
speaking of mouth my mouth saying these
words about our sponsor kono kono is
excited to introduce the hex gears x1
keyboard low-profile Bluetooth
mechanical keyboard with multi device
connectivity in a beautifully machined
aluminum case check out the link below
to learn more
so how do you control a mouse with your
mouth well the first step is to actually
get this device close enough to your
face which quad Joey accomplishes with a
clamp and a mounting arm now there are
two styles of clamps available and this
is the most popular one there's also
this like kind of pipe mounting clamp
one which can grab on to pretty much
anything so it's better for wheelchairs
but it's almost three times the price
and both of them can connect to the
mounting arm in multiple orientations so
this one this little bit unscrews and
you can put it on any one of these five
mounting points and then this one you
either put it on sideways and mount it
here or here or here or you put it on
this way and mount it up here that's
what we're gonna be doing then you got
your mounting on this thing is
heavy-duty
a/s like it's sturdy enough to keep the
device in place in there like look I'm
waving it around and it's not bending
but it's also flexible enough that you
can tailor it to your exact setup and
I'll stay exactly where you want it's
also got this really nice articulating
end here that again really nice quality
you just loosen up configure however you
want it tighten it up with just one knob
and boom this gives you the precision
you need to get the quad joy to your
lips please stand by while Linus
installs the device
so the mouse itself basically a single
joystick so you can probably see the
cursor moving it around but with the
added ability to respond to your breath
so out of the box
it's totally plug-and-play with no
software required and the basic I don't
know I guess you could call them like
gestures that it's pre-programmed with
or a sick for left click or a puff for
right click cool right now there is a
learning curve so to get to the same
level that I would have with my hands
would take tens if not hundreds of hours
but the folks at quad joy have done
their best to make it as easy as
possible first of all there are LED
indicators that you can actually see out
of your peripheral vision so it's easy
to tell for example when you've entered
what they call scrolling mode all you've
got to do is puff until this indicator
turns green and then you can puff and
sip in order to scroll up and down a
page pretty cool and there's the totally
optional quad joy desktop app that lets
you take these default actions and
greatly expand them you can do a ton of
tweaking to everything from how the
stick behaves to pointer speed and
acceleration to even the required breath
force it's actually pretty deep and the
best part is the amount of customization
that they give you with the gestures
with just sipping and puffing so like
you can program up to 12 different
actions with basically whatever key
binding you want so so you could you
know puff soft then hard for
control-alt-delete or to launch the
calculator or whatever the case may be
it's awesome but wait there's more
actually a lot more so you can execute
functions with multiple types of
gestures not just sipping and puffing
like by moving the stick to the edge and
holding for example check this out
there it is and you can actually create
a gesture to switch modes giving you a
whole other layer of commands on the fly
using those same sips and puffs or hold
stick to edges and then what's cool is
you can import and export your settings
so you can optimize the mouse or the
quad joy as it were for different
applications on your computer
leading us of course then to the
question with all this customization can
you game on it well record cool did I
help you really in the net alright so
believe it or not it depends on the game
you can actually play something like
rocket League with near full
functionality since all you need is
movement with the stick and then boost
and jump can be done with your breaths
pretty cool right and even mouse centric
games like RTS RPG or board games were
shockingly functional now the trick each
onra is FPS so can it run Crysis ok
technically this isn't crisis but
whatever the same principle is applied
now to do this properly you'd really
want to joysticks one for looking around
and then one for moving and we couldn't
find an effective way to do both of
those things at the same time on the
quad joy so the best we managed was
using the stick to look and then just
inhaling to move forward and then
puffing the shoot now it technically
works but it's a pretty bad time
but what if you used the stick to run
around been stopped switch mouse modes
to look around a name and shoot and then
switch back to keep moving
that's basically what twitch dreamer
rocky no hands does and odds are he can
absolutely pone you at fortnight
however he uses a different controller
the quad stick so would this approach
work on the quad joy ah
unfortunately no because the software
doesn't let you bind stick movements to
key presses like up equals W what they
do offer is a sold separately 210 dollar
feature called joystick mode that we
actually ended up needing third party
software called joy to key to fully
utilize it does allow you to move around
using the stick
but it creates a new problem so they
don't actually let you do gestures in
joystick mode so you have no way to
quickly switch back to Mouse mode when
you're done moving around and it's time
to aim and fire at something all right
then so assuming you're in the market
for a mouse mouse should you buy the
plod joy if you're a gamer well it's
clearly not designed with gaming in mind
but for general computer use there are
really a lot of great things about it
that are hampered by a couple of
complaints one the amount of play on the
mounting arm is in our minds
unacceptable for something that costs
complaint number two this much this
wiggle in the mount right down here
amounts to a significant dead zone in
either the X or the y axis depending on
which way you mount it and at $1400 quad
joy costs about double what the quad
stick does and that one has been proven
to be performance enough for competitive
gaming and with multiple mouth options
so I don't see why you might not start
there instead though GB
we haven't tested any of the other
products in the market and we're not
really the target consumer for these
products anyway the purpose of this
video for us was to experience a type of
mouse input that we had never tried
before and draw attention to a segment
of the market that really doesn't get
talked about much so if you have
experience with either of the products
we've talked about or maybe another one
we didn't cover please leave a message
in the comment section below
speaking of below below we're gonna have
a link to brilliant brilliant believes
that effective learning is active not
passive and learning from lectures and
videos isn't as effective as diving in
and doing things for yourself and
brilliant provides you with the
framework for thinking about and solving
problems so it's kind of like a
problem-solving website that teaches you
to think like a computer scientist by
guiding you through problems so they
take a concept break it up into
bite-sized pieces present clear thinking
in each part and then build back up to
an interesting conclusion so head over
to brilliant org forward slash Linus
tech tips and get 20% off today we're
gonna have that linked below so thanks
for watching guys if this video sucked
this video sorry my mouth is actually
kind of tired if it sucked you know what
to do but if it was awesome get
subscribed hit that like button or check
out the link to where to buy the stuff
we featured in the video description

has cool shirts like this one and our
