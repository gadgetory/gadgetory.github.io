acquired our company back in early q2 of
2016 so you can imagine how upset our
emerald overlords were when we decided
to test 10 years worth of AMD video
cards before giving the green team the
same treatment well we finally put out
the fire in our server room and just in
time
to bring you the other side of the GPU
performance coin
welcome to Nvidia video cards through
the ages
Rockets sq+ Force FX features
pressure-sensitive qwe
a si D keys which can be configured in
three different modes for multiple
functions check it out now at the link
below there's going to be a long video
so let's get right into it
we used a 59 60 X test bench with 64
gigs of DDR 4 RAM to isolate the
performance of the graphics cards and we
used the same benchmarks as AMD GPUs
through the ages for consistency first
up is in videos ancient flagship the
8800 GTX this card was freaking
revolutionary it brought us an all-new
architecture called Tesla in the biggest
chip we had ever seen in a GPU codename
g80
it was built on the same 90 nanometer
processed node as its predecessor G 71
but was over twice as big with almost
two and a half times as many transistors
devoted to gaming performance enabling
new DirectX 10 features like SM 4.0 and
a reduction in API overhead CUDA which
is still very much in use today and
enabled developer to run general-purpose
code on the graphics chip and the
ability to run three cards at once in
SLI which isn't to say that it's
standalone performance wasn't impressive
in its own right G 80 with its 768 Meg's
of gddr3 RAM on a wide 384 bit bus
smacked around even to of invidious
previous flagships in SLI and all of
that for a measly hundred dollars more
which almost makes me feel better about
the cash-grab
8800 altra that they released six months
later for two hundred and thirty more
dollars that was basically the same
thing with a fancy plastic shroud on it
the GeForce 8800 GT wasn't strictly
speaking a new flagship but rather a
weird
Tesla architecture refresh it was the
first built by Nvidia on
SMC's shiny new 65 nanometer process
this node shrink allowed nvidia to drop
power consumption by 60 watts reduce the
die size and actually bump up the
transistor count at the same time a
modest increase that you guessed it no
actually you probably didn't
the 8800 GT was on par or slower than
its predecessor almost across the board
due to its narrower memory bus and 16
fewer shader units where people got
excited was the price 8800 GT was less
than half the price of 8800 GTX it was
single slot enabling em ATX users to run
to an SLI with additional expansion
cards and it also featured an on-chip
display engine finally it was the first
consumer GPU with a PCI Express 2.0
interface which still to this day is
barely saturated by flagship graphics
cards the last flagship silicon before
Nvidia transitioned to the GTX insert
three numbers and maybe a couple letters
here nomenclature was G 92 the beating
heart of the 9800 gtx+ ask you that low
burden videos cost and bumped up
performance over the architectural e
identical 9800 GTX by shrinking from 65
to 55 nanometers and boosting up the
clock speed now we get to the GTX 280
yes we know it actually came out before
that last one I was talking about but
deal with it
so forget everything we said earlier
about 55 nanometer the 280 built on the
mature 65 nanometer process had a
massive 576 square millimeter die with
1.4 billion transistors and to put that
insanity in context AMD's closest
competitor the 4870 had a measly 959
million and further driving up
complexity it shipped with a minimum of
one gigabyte of
ethics memory on a huge 512 bit bus
something nvidia hasn't done before or
since on a consumer card the good news
is that it absolutely crushed their
previous generation efforts even
delivering ample performance for
stereoscopic 3d gaming a big push for
Nvidia at that time we'll skip over the
300 series because all of these were
just crappy rebrands for notebooks and
Best Buy pcs meaning that the next real
GPU in line is the GTX 480 based on the
then all new and now infamous Fermi
architecture this was in videos first
swing at DirectX 11 support which is
still widely used today and this is
becoming a bit of a common theme but
while the new 40 nanometer process
allowed it to be smaller than the GTX
280 it was still huge with a 529 square
millimeter die a whomping 3 billion
transistors and support for DDD are 5
memory which again is still widely used
today interesting fact Nvidia apparently
thought it performed so well not just in
gaming but also in compute which was a
big focus for Fermi that the largest
configuration of GF 100 silicon never
actually made its way into a shipping
product or maybe that was due to power
constraints cuz uh yeah even with the
theoretical efficiency advantage of a
smaller node the 480 was such a barbecue
that Nvidia provided a convenient Grill
on the face of the card to cook your
eggs our next contestant is the GTX 580
and it featured an optimized and fully
enabled Fermi dubbed GF 110 we've got
most of the usual improvements here more
vram higher clock speeds and a slightly
smaller die but nothing as exciting as
video card cooking which we mean in a
good way 580 performed noticeably better
than 480 while also managing lower
temperatures noise
power consumption it was kind of like
the GTX 480 s if that makes sense to the
Apple fans out there in a seventh corner
of our showdown this must be a
weird-looking ring we have the GTX 680
ah yes
goodbye Fermi hello Kepler a lot of
things changed here for K 60 Hertz
output was enabled via DisplayPort 1.2
PCI Express 3.0 burst onto the scene
with double the bandwidth of version 2
the die size shrunk way down to 294
square millimeters and the gddr5 got
kicked up a notch to 6 gigahertz thanks
to a newly redesigned memory controller
finally we got it wait a minute
we dropped down to a 256 bit bus hold on
a sec look at that codename NVIDIA top
tier chips usually end in a zero well
what they did was they used AMD's
complacency and a new 28 nanometer
process along with some dynamic power
tricks called GPU boost to crank up
performance so much that they gave us a
step-down chip as a replacement for a
top-tier one to save a buck and still
managed to make it look like an upgrade
not that they passed any of those
savings to the consumer it was priced at
$500
same as the GTX 580 though I guess at
least we got Hardware h.264 encoding for
game stream and shadowplay g-sync
variable refresh rate technology and
support for the Vulcan API
now the next logical stop in our journey
might seem like gtx 780 but in February
2013 Nvidia kicked convention and logic
in the head with a Titan card based on
the chip that might have been GTX 680 in
a parallel universe where AMD had been
keeping up but instead it turned into
780 and then
780ti so we're going to go with that
since it was kind of the final form of
the gk110 now not much changed product
or feature wise here big Kepler was a
much bigger much badder 680 with a 90
percent bigger die more than double the
transistors at a whopping 7 billion and
a $6.99 price tag to go with it
ouch at least though this amounted to a
sizeable bump in performance over last
generations 680 in basically every
application in another unconventional
move Nvidia completely skipped over 800
series and went straight to 900 so even
though the 980 and the 980 TI were 9
months apart we're going to bunch them
together because apparently that's what
everybody's doing
so the 900 series was actually based on
the same 28 nanometer process as Kepler
shrinking silicon got a lot harder in
the early 2010's but two years later we
were due for some kind of performance
improvement so Nvidia's engineers
brought us maxwell these GPUs feature an
integrated arm CPU which according to
Nvidia provides more independence from a
given system's primary CPU the 980 again
a step-down chip in big kid clothes
performs a little better than the kepler
GTX 780 Ti which is an impressive feat
but the big story is efficiency it
boasts an 85 watt lower TDP the 980ti
was a bit of a different story though it
rocked eight billion transistors an
unheard-of 601 square millimeter die
Nvidia is biggest ever six gigs of VRAM
and all the API support you could ever
want
except maybe DirectX 12 depending on who
you ask
while Maxwell was marketed as fully
DirectX 12 capable the developer of
ashes of the singularity oxide games
found that maxwell cards performed very
poor
early with a sink compute enabled it's
kind of a big deal so all of this
amounted to an astonishing performance
improvement considering the lack of
processed node change and hdmi 2.0
support was a nice touch
finally we arrived at the modern day the
gtx 1080 and 1080 TI based on the pascal
architecture 10 series GPUs have brought
a lot to the table including gddr5 X at
the top end which increased memory
speeds to up to 10 gigahertz multiple
DisplayPort 1.4 ports for 8k and high
refresh 4k monitor support high
bandwidth SLI bridges not to mention the
elimination of three-way and four-way
SLI for gaming and the smallest
manufacturing node yet 16 nanometer 1080
launched in May of 2016 with 7.2 billion
transistors and this is becoming a
pattern now a small performance
improvement over the 980 TI then 1080 TI
followed with a much more substantial
bump one of the biggest stories here
though was really compute Pascal was
designed to be a compute powerhouse with
the top-tier GP 100 chip going actually
unused in gaming products so 1080 Ti and
it's Titan analog were instead based on
GP 102 anew in between tier the
ingenious EWS 360 ap is an enterprise
class dual band access point that's
ideal for large offices schools and
hospitality guest Wi-Fi access
it features AC speeds with business
class features and operates an
autonomous or managed modes it's got a
three by three antenna design and a
high-powered radio and comes with a free
management software called
easy master you can manage anywhere from
one access point to thousands and there
are no per device license fees so that
means no annual subscription which is
great
for keeping the total cost of ownership
