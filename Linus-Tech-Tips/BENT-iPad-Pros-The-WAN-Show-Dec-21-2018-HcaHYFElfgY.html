every good then that's not gonna be a
problem yeah we're telling everyone on
this show later
what are we tell ya later later yeah
it's when show time yeah actually it was
when show time half an hour ago but it I
was doing I was doing something really
important very important but your
children I know I can't oh no I know
it's like it's a whole thing
Oh like it's a thing okay yeah so that's
fair because it's a thing I can't show
them the thing cuz that's like oh that's
kind of the point kind of the thing okay
yeah yeah so I really all ban I really
wish I could show you because I'm so
excited I've never been this excited
about maybe never but I haven't been
this excited about a package of
Technology arriving what about Lee this
year what about okay okay like because I
don't think that was this year but the
last time he did something somewhat
similar it was like a bunch of packages
that was that was pretty cool too that
was that was equal equal equal equal
right um so guys we've got a great show
for you today here we're live on YouTube
twitch and floatplane com we've got
actually a bunch of floatplane updates
for you we've got some Linus tech tips
updates for you we have a new merch
store hey it has higher quality shirts
and also some designs that are like is
that even line is tech tips I don't know
it just kind of looks cool I don't who
knows you actually can't make out the
only thing about it that is ltte yeah
who knows but l TT that's kind of traced
in the constellations in the sky
mountain thing don't worry good um so
we've got a lot of great topics for you
guys today there's a rumor circulating
that Nvidia will be launching the GTX xi
series I think you're gonna need more
like tech wiki what the heck is going on
episodes cuz like wow this is this is
this is great yeah this is gonna get
pretty confusing
and speaking of equally awesome iPad
pros are apparently shipping bent which
Apple does not consider to be a defect
note by design more on this at 11:00 get
more on Oh
Oh Rick I've made that joke before been
a while
fortnight sue is being sued for the
Carlton dance by Carlton I guess yeah
like Carlton the hotel's no Ritz Carlton
Fresh Prince you don't know
oh that Carlton yeah wait what it's like
I can't is in fortnight I don't know
what his dance is so I can't do it
what yeah okay well I haven't I'm not
I'm not I'll talk more about that later
and the boring company tunnel demo is
apparently disappointing so you're such
a fanboy you're gonna find a way to not
be disappointed about it but we can do
that later no it's all predispose
I guess I see why we do it this way
maybe I'm totally off my rocker it's
just a pain oh how was your week
uh actually really good guess what got
enabled I I haven't seen anyone
complaining about it yet I have seen
someone in the chat said stream looks
great from Spain so that's good which
would make sense because we have a
server somewhat near there the cool
thing that was enabled this week that
wasn't enabled last week on flow plane
on flow plane is that we now have sort
of load balancing for live streams which
is cool it's like duct tape yeah I'm
like popsicle sticks right it's not like
super intelligent load balancing but
there's a little bit of load balancing
and lastly we were on one box now just
about lit it on fire yes and now we're
on like all of the edges that normally
serve normal video content from Flula
you should probably explain for the
uninitiated what it is so it's an edge
service so you have like your your mains
a browser it's got this great engine
designed by Microsoft
not anymore just kidding but so so edge
servers are like there's the the main
servers that like store all your data
and like receive videos and transcode
videos and do all that kind of stuff the
edge servers are generally closer to
people that's why they're called edge
servers on the edge and they are the
ones actually serve the video to you so
now the live streams are actually going
to those boxes instead of just being
delivered from one does it look well
better it looks really good actually
yeah I'm a little out of focus because
I'm leaning forward to look at my laptop
but when I'm sitting here normally like
here I'm just gonna turn my brightness
up a little bit so you you can yeah
looks pretty good right now we don't
have manual selectors for quality so
yeah sorry about that that will be
coming at some point I don't have like a
very specific and even if you did he
probably wouldn't deliver it at that
time nope getrekt software oh man
[Laughter]
spend two years who even knows thank you
have been two years but we have to
factor now yeah actually there's a lot
of stuff happening over the next
probably four to six weeks and some of
it even sooner so yes for accounting
reasons yeah flow plane through the
forum is going to be going away yeah
like in ten days
so our fiscal year end is December 31st
for both linus media group and
floatplane media yeah think about it we
sync that up that was there was a
rationale behind it I forget why not our
department
yeah but anyway they both have their
fiscal year ends and up until now the
accounting between the two companies has
been sort of complicated because the
money comes into the Linus tech tips
forum which is owned by Linus Media
Group then it has to be passed through
to floatplane media which is its own
ownership structure then floatplane
media has to take its cut from the user
subscription fee and then give the money
back to Linus Media Group Inc and then
also the calculations for any taxes and
deductions for processing fees like
payment processing fees has to be done
somewhere in there and it has been quite
frankly untenable we just cannot
continue to do this so the reality of it
is we're gonna have to do it at some
point we're gonna find a way well not
just not we're gonna find a way we have
a way that we're that we're pitching to
everyone who subscribed through the
forum that we're gonna be able to make
it more palatable with and I forget
exactly what the plan is but okay so
there's a few plans one of them is if
you are subscribed on the new website on
January 31st it's gonna be like a
one-time flip over make sure you're done
before January 31st I don't know when on
January 31st it's gonna happen but like
it's happening on that day we're not
giving warning so do subscribe sign up
now
better stretch a spit wit tech deals
subscribe to ya
every single person actively subscribed
at that time doesn't matter if you were
still in the form doesn't matter if
you're already on the new site etc you
just have to be subscribed on the new
site flow playing calm before January
31st and if you are have an active
subscription at that time we are giving
you two free months for everybody you're
subscribed to and Kyle Jason if you guys
are watching chill we're gonna top you
up for any one that we gave three months
to you will be it's all get handled yeah
also if you are subscribed at that time
you'll be getting an exclusive one-time
only accessible emoji in the chat that
you can use across all chats we're not
even sure what it is yet but that will
become a thing by January 31st and it
might even be cool I think that's gonna
do it right I haven't asked him yet now
but yeah I don't know I guess Lloyd also
exists will talk to someone
we'll figure it out and then eventually
I don't have a specific date for this
probably before January 31st but we're
cutting off your access before then so
haha
the liesecke tips.com website will have
embedded player from Flo playing comm
you'll just only be able to see it if
you're subscribed through Flo playing
calm so we're getting rid of
subscriptions on the forum they're gonna
be gone but you can still have your
discussion about the video yeah on the
forum if that tickles your pickle yes
but like the the ability to have that
video playing there I don't entirely
know when that will be ready but yeah
we're we're switching the like main
source because all the payments really
need to go through full open dark they
have to go through floatplane comment
it's an absolute nightmare the way that
it is now it's just not sustainable it's
a problem and these and we are getting
to the point where we're close enough to
launching some other really key features
that it's really really important to get
this clean now
yeah because we could be adding more
creators sooner rather than later
especially in light of some of the news
that has come out around you know other
self funding platforms and stuff like
that there's a fair bit of controversy
at the moment so we are kind of looking
at
going well if only gosh darn it if only
there was some alternative from you know
someone else that you know if only that
were a thing if only someone who's been
working on it for a while and it's like
finally kind of coming together yeah
if only if only darn shame yeah such a
thing just if only just yeah um
also some other some other pretty cool
flow plane news the final episode of
secret shopper is live on float plane I
haven't seen it yet but I'm really
excited so if you guys want to go check
it out that's float plane comm just go
sign up and then you can always like
cancel after a month if that was the
only video that you wanted to watch or
whatever but yeah it's it's it's it's
awesome basically it's it's um so far
the feedback on it is really good not
everyone agrees with our conclusion
though and I would be really really
interested to see what you guys think
also I should be careful with the word
final because we've had a lot of
requests from our floatplane members
already that for a fifth episode where
we reach out to every one of the
companies and either invite a
representative on to come and say their
piece or like read out their letters
yeah transparency telling them who we
are seeking comment now that you have
seen all these videos you've heard
feedback from customers because I've
seen people tweeting different companies
and stuff it's gotten a little real what
do you want to say you can add your
voice I love that that's awesome so that
may happen because we've we've I've been
reached out to personally by the CEO of
at least one of the companies with
comments I've been also reached out to
personally by PR managers for some of
these companies I I will say this Janice
got a personal apology from iBUYPOWER
they actually get this they subscribed
to floatplane so they could be keeping
an eye on this a week early before
that's awesome respect by the way to
every single one of them for
absolutely nothing to damage the
editorial process for us so whether they
had the best value as a gaming rig or
whether they had a poor a poor showing
in pre-sales or customer support or
packaging or whatever else every single
one of them not only didn't you know
threaten us or or or behave in such a
manner because technically you know
there it would be tough because we're
Canadian and they're all American so
technically they could have at least
sent a threatening letter about us
recording the calls without telling them
or whatever the case may be
not only did nobody behave in that
manner which I didn't think they would I
mean that's making a bad PR situation a
lot worse you go in like sue Linus tech
tips because they showed that your
customer supports I don't think they
would lose anyways like that's a bad bad
move I'm pretty sure all of Canada's
single party concern but not only that
but every single one of them that
reached out to us said hey we have a
comment or whatever but we completely
respect the work you guys are doing and
we're not going to interfere
that's let us know if you want to chat
when it's over that's cool I really I am
in strong support of that final episode
so I think that'll be really cool
someone someone on the floatplane chat
said Wow quality so much better on
floatplane yes I think that's not gonna
be necessarily true for everyone but
we're trying yeah honestly their place
there was another cub there's been a few
different comments talking about I'm
supposed to look at somebody's name who
starts with dark and I lost it but I had
already read it so it's okay
he was asking for Oh dark force there it
is doc full dark force says tutorial for
moving Ltd for membership to floatplane
would be awesome it's pretty easy if you
want a tutorial I don't remember the
exact menu titles but it's um it's just
go to your like go to the store online
stock tips calm go to your settings or
subscriptions or whatever click the
cancel button go to flow plan calm
subscribe
and you can also cancel within your
PayPal dashboard also that that's a
foolproof way to do it it's not the same
as like issuing a like a charge back
through PayPal like no don't get
penalized or anything like that it's not
quite as clean so if you're doing it to
a site that's like running actively not
as cool necessarily though we're nuking
all of ya kalai effective site anyway so
we don't care just can't just stop the
billing agreement somehow doesn't really
matter yeah but yeah if you're doing
that to a site that's actively running
oh they're not necessarily gonna know
why the billing agreement stall so
PayPal is API doesn't because they're
probably using Braintree and PayPal
Braintree don't like properly
communicating but everything they owned
by the city yup it's terrible so like
depending on how the implementation
works it might not necessarily notice
why so it might think that it failed for
a bad reason and then like try again
or might well it won't try again because
the billing agreements cancel sure it
might like automatically reach out to
you and be like hey billing failed and
we don't really know why beautiful
perfect makes sense um yeah uh-oh people
are asking about yearly subscription
well take care of you so send me a
message or send full plain help at
gmail.com a message you will be handled
you will get your free two months all
that kind of stuff should we get a new
alias for help yeah like just support it
flow plane column or something yeah okay
is there like any reason that couldn't
be done like right away another of
another inbox or some what is it like
hard-coded into things no it's not
actually we don't have a G Apps account
for at flow point we don't know because
it's at flow plain media I thought we
got one not a G ops account really so
currently we're paying nothing for it oh
I see okay and an individual G Apps
account okay if you you should make a
group for it and have individual people
as the gfs accounts but there's no one
to put that on sir so I just haven't
really okay I'll do it though yeah well
well we'll get on that because like
honestly when when people reach out to
Linus Media Group like they're like yeah
we are a very professional Amazon seller
with you know
many great products we'd like to we'd
like to sponsor your channel or whatever
and it's sent from gmail don't worry
yeah well we'll fix that literally every
time oh I also want to have just like a
support page yes that you can contact
that would be good we should we should
have that that's that's that's actually
pretty much done it's just not in yet so
be in soon talk about 2fa being at it
yeah - if a is added when you when you
log in fopen com click on the little
widget in the corner go to your settings
go to security and then we're
legitimately actually making progress
now yeah well not what we were before
but like you can sort a stuff we're
doing a lot of backend stuff before
which is less fun for other people in G
suite whatever min you knew what I meant
okay so let's go ahead and jump into an
actual news topic yeah that's well I
mean this is actual news it's just news
about us and also like what no problem
it was mentioned at one point in time
that lines dips subscriptions we're
going to cost more is that happening now
or is that happening when we leave beta
I don't know yeah I have no idea what a
tremendous wonderful question so right
now it's we've actually given very
little a thought to a cohesive flow
plane subscriptions /youtube memberships
/ whatever other sort of direct support
plans - just so everyone knows with this
whole plan that was already in place if
you were already subscribed your
subscription was not being bumped you
were being grandfathered in at whatever
you were at already we were just going
to increase the cost for new users but
god if we're gonna do that or not um so
so yeah we don't have a cohesive
strategy right now over on youtube it's
five bucks
okay on floatplane it's three on youtube
you don't get early access on floatplane
you do so this pricing structure really
doesn't make it
of cents yeah YouTube has features that
we simply won't be able to deliver on
floatplane at this time like stories
okay so so there's there's that I guess
but that has nothing to do with
memberships cuz right now there's no way
to do a members specific story and then
they're both gonna get live streams from
now on actually it was just a total like
brain fart that the oil PC build stream
earlier today didn't go on flow plane
we'll deal with that next time and then
flow plane also has sort of other things
that are going to be coming later but
that won't be over there so we just we
just really don't know what to do right
now there I said it
some people are pointing out that the
forum is at $2.99 and full plane it is
$3 0.00 cents
really so we got rid of the penny in
Canada actually three dollars I mean
okay no you know what no I'm not
conceding on this one okay that is ten
cents in a year twelve but like I think
it's fine I think we're fine why don't
we talk about the Carlton dance what the
hell is a Carlton dance I don't know
okay cuz like I didn't really I wasn't
like I know it's a thing I think you
like swinger I was back and forth and
like do something but I don't really
know okay here we go here we go oh man
what is he this okay this was restricted
from playing in your current geographic
region Wow well you know what I think we
can kind of get the point yeah I think
you like throw your hips out and like
flail your arms up and then snap em in
the other way so the article here spa
blah blah the Carlton dance was a
trademark of Ribeiro's iconic character
and he's now claiming that the fresh
emote in fortnight is an exact replica
of his well-known
moves has alfonso ribeiro checked the
year lately does that matter are those
moves that well-known anymore the PM
oats called fresh i think people are
pretty aware i think the developers were
aware of what they were doing but i
think in the context of anyone under 25
this it's a night dance yeah yeah also i
still don't think that gives you grounds
at what point does john travolta be like
you can't do this i mean i would make
the argument that that saturday night
fever that movie covered yeah is far
more iconic than anything else Fonzo
Ribeiro has ever done to go I in the end
I agree with you but to go against okay
right now okay yeah I'm just having some
fun to go ahead say whatever you want
say it doesn't matter that something's
more iconic you still defend your
trademark like like like yeah apples the
kind of a bigger deal or YouTube or or
patreon or Apple or Microsoft we're all
kind of a bigger deal than floatplane
and mines media group but we would
defend our trademark to a certain degree
we'll do our best
like if someone put like ltte addition
unlike some hardware and again we'd be
like hey dog you actually can't you know
what are you doing yeah that's not okay
dance dance moves are traditionally very
hard to protect this way yeah like as
far as I've heard you can protect the
specific choreography but you can't
actually protect like performing the
dance and then that gets weird cuz it's
like in a game another thing I was
actually really confused about is what
actually gives him the right to sue that
is something that I was kind of gonna
bring up as his character it's not him
it's his character I mean that's that's
another like I could never this isn't
really relevant I mean yeah but I could
never sit it's not the same thing it's a
name whatever ignore that part I
couldn't
see someone over the use of slick azzam
thingy no cuz that was or like that was
not me that did but then here's the
thing catchphrases have been
successfully trademarked like the let's
get ready to I'm not gonna say it okay
yeah but wasn't that because he was an
independent actor yes this is he was on
a show there was producers there was
executive producers there's people that
owned the trademark of yes there's
copyright holders yes involved in there
that are not he was paid to be on the
show I don't think he owned he might I
could be wrong but let's assume he isn't
so here here's just a bit more of a
summary here so he's filed suit against
Epic Games claiming he's in the process
of copywriting with dance so to be clear
he hasn't already copyrighted it it's
widely misses this is a quote it is
widely recognized that mister Ribeiro's
likeness and intellectual property have
been misappropriated by Epic Games in
the most popular video game currently in
the world for tonight there's also
plenty of games that have this dance
that's has earned record profits profits
off of downloadable content in the game
including emotes like fresh okay so
they're selling it which I guess is a
bit more of a gray area yeah yeah epic
has failed to compensate or even ask
permission from mr. Ribeiro for the use
of his likeness and iconic intellectual
property so what someone said he
improvised the dance that's why he's
claiming it if you improvise something
on a show you are paid to act on that
does not at all mean you just get it
guess who owns a catchphrase that Luke
says on the land show that's just how it
works yeah he has a contract that says
that yeah in fact that's like the whole
point if Luke invents something at
floatplane media incorporated now that's
like okay that's a little bit more
complicated but it's lighter the the
entity that will own his invention will
be floatplane media incorporated it's in
his contract and I'm it's probably in
his contract with that said it was the
80s maybe it was a wild a time but I
find it very very hard to believe now
earlier this man
rapper to milli launched nearly
identical legal action against the game
claiming the swipe it mo
rips off the Millie rock dance he
invented and they have also filed suits
against 2k games for featuring their
dance moves as player modes in that
franchise - so where exactly is the line
here it's sort of my feedback on this I
don't know because the arguments being
made that they're using his likeness but
I would make the counter-argument that a
fortnight characters likeness is really
not very close to a real person these
are very cartoony and as far as I can
tell who the heck was it that tricht it
was at Lindsay Lohan or something that
tried to claim that GTA yeah yeah she's
lost yeah she lost and in a hilarious
way the judge was like that's just like
an average like whatever it's completely
clad female doesn't matter yeah so I
think that that arguing that this
likeness is that arguing the likeness is
tough arguing the dance move Oh
again I think that's really hard and
like to say that putting your hip in one
direction and swinging your arms and the
other yeah is like the most unique thing
I think that's pretty much the whole
dance like I don't know like you've
probably the rest I don't know and like
he probably got that from somewhere or
maybe not or maybe people do invent
dance moves like it not every dance move
has been done yet invention man you know
I think said in interviews that he stole
it some random person in chat said I
don't know but like the thing is with
stuff like dance and music you have
inspirations yes music has samples it's
like a part of making music Ice Ice Baby
didn't like and a hilarious thing about
that particular one is I actually didn't
know that that was just a sample really
yeah I actually didn't know because who
is it man what give me a County under
pressure it's who's sue song is that but
you wouldn't know queen yeah thank you
yeah you wouldn't know well you you
don't know yeah but like I don't know
your crap music I know Queen you don't
know you don't know knows you don't know
you don't know movies oh I don't know
shows movie okay right this is another
thing I was gonna bring up so another
really complicated aspect of copyright
law that I have to admit that I don't
fully understand I wish John was still
working out of this office in here like
last week yeah um is how exactly it
works where the line is between what
aspects of a character the actor owns
versus the copyright holder so like when
Ryan Reynolds you know shows up on
late-night TV as Deadpool hmm that's a
live appearance what is in his contract
with respect to how much in character he
has to be or how much Ryan Reynolds he
is in that moment right where is the
line here yeah who invented a particular
characteristic because like a really
famous example of an actor taking a role
and transforming it in a way that was
not even really agreed to at least
initially by the producers and the
director was samuel l.jackson 'he's
character in Kingsman so he sort of in
interviews has talked about how the the
rest of the rest of the management on
the movie was kind of like so you want
to have a lisp and he kind of he kind of
pushed for it because he really believed
that that was an important part of
creating this iconic villain he didn't
amazing job oh yeah he was just like
both the kings and movies are amazing
one of my favorite movie villains of all
time in that movie he did he just did
such a great job of crazy maniac but in
a totally offbeat kitschy kind of way
that just worked perfectly with the
movie anyway that those mannerisms of
the character samuel l.jackson came in
and invented
so if fortnight were to do and emot--
that like kind of mimics his body
movements I denied it during an iconic
scene in that movie and kind of you know
melts his line but like doesn't say it
doesn't take the actual audio who owns
that is that Samuel dr. Jackson's
property is that what I don't know
universal whoever whoever owns the Kings
I don't know yeah intellectual property
yeah I think there's gonna be a tough
one to win because this opens up
floodgates on really almost any kind of
artistic imitation so you know I felt
like I didn't really have a position
until I went off for a little while
there and now I actually feel like I
feel like I'm ready to take a position
on this one I I think he's off his
rocker I think he's probably out of
money and this is a desperation move
yeah I mean maybe not out of money maybe
maybe he actually has lots of money
maybe he invested well and Wow
just sub Don floatplane holy s word the
quality difference much appreciation as
a dev myself heck yeah thank you very
much yeah I agree it's weird I also who
knows we don't know law very much at all
no we don't and then also it's American
I'm a lawyer so also that also that oh
geez don't know what's happening but I
think if on a project am I allowed to
say oh geez oh geez where's that is that
Rick and Morty now like oh is that a
catchphrase yeah yeah I think that's a
bit of a different think as spoken word
versus dance but then that's also hard I
think it's a it's a very weird section
but I also do oh my that logic how could
you copyright let's get ready to rumble
in
that's good Oh
cuz that's actually bad right like he
charges you for that yeah yeah you won't
go after you crazy like full full full D
mode okay just going for it cuz that but
that wouldn't that also have like the
way that you say it attached to it um
probably maybe I don't know Jesus oh
jeez I don't think you were supposed to
drop that again we don't know this stuff
I don't know I don't think he personally
has the ability to do this I think the
copyright holders of Carlton and Fresh
Prince would be the ones don't have to
do this a boring company demo is boring
this was originally forum by two nerdom
and the original article was from
Gizmodo and this is this is pretty um
this is pretty disappointing like riding
on a dirt road first reviews of Elon
Musk's underground tunnel are
disappointing apparently they had
trouble getting a paving machine down
there for some reason so it left the
surface really bumpy so it was like
driving on a dirt road apparently one
passenger got sick the vehicle only
accelerate to 80 kilometers an hour so
that's what like 50 miles 40 40
something high that's nuts not great
yeah it's not fast great oh yeah on
Wednesday Musk tweeted next step for
boring company loop is demonstrating
high throughput at high speed target is
4,000 vehicles per hour at 55 miles per
hour
also known as 250 km/h probably anybody
what what sorry what 250 kilometers an
hour yeah Oh at a hundred and fifty-five
miles per hour so I thought you said 55
no yeah okay so that is apparently the
next goal okay that's a big that is a
pretty big bump they will definitely
have to repave and also a big note here
is that they were using like model X's
as your vehicles
and all the demos they've shown like big
buses and like just start there are
types of vehicles apparently they're
saying the bumpers that they have on the
inside could be attached to essentially
any autonomous electric vehicle not just
to Tesla sure so that's interesting so
they're not like married to their other
company which makes sense but yeah I
don't know I'm not surprised it was kind
of disappointing I think they probably
shouldn't have demoed it yet or they
should have demoed it with the right
expectations if this is the state they
were at they must have known they didn't
make it go 250 kilometers an hour they
must have known they were only gonna go
80 and it was gonna feel very much like
driving at 80 on a road they tried it
yeah but I don't know I think maybe they
could have have communicated that a
little bit better or just not done a
test yet yeah setting expectations is
sort of key yeah so I think that's
probably where they missed the mark here
what is a tipos you just oh yeah but
you're supposed to be standing hence the
TD part Oh someone wants me to t pose
for five seconds but you're supposed to
yeah you have to frame that's just yeah
that's that's gonna be a problem okay no
but there you go big word it was worth a
shot

actually have the best sponsors PIAA

that's where their name came from they

the VP
I feel like they'd be more of a
defensive character those are all
reactionary shots attacks of opportunity
take what's up Oh rude what you love P
ia why would you kill it yeah yeah P is
good stuff so go to LMG oh that that
link this link sucks go to LMG ji t /p
ia Wham yay yeah we made one of those
you know we really need to upgrade this
graphic yes we do
speaking of upgrades um Nvidia is
downgrading it's Christmas
there are TX what about it I did it you
did Squarespace and you didn't even
notice no I was reading wow that is a
whole other level of tuning out that is
actually amazing
there was important things happening of
oblation I did an entire sponsor read
and you didn't hear it at all do you
ever listen sometimes I'm actually
curious very selectively when we're on
the show are you listening to my yeah
yes because sometimes I tune out of
yours I don't blame you a little rude
okay that's hilarious okay so let's talk
about in video
new gtx 1100 series i couldn't figure
out why they skipped a bunch of numbers
now I get it do you do I get it now yeah
yeah why so here's what they're doing
okay
NVIDIA I mean they're not stupid hmm do
you think they're stupid
I mean collectively no so I don't think
Nvidia is stupid and so when I was when
I was looking at it going like okay so
we got this RTX thing clearly the
hardware you're shipping now especially
anything that isn't the top of the line
is not powerful enough to do anything
anything other than these first gen and
I'm gonna call them experiences because
obviously this is going to get better
over time yeah like like five ten years
from now real time rate racing in this
manner or another one could be an
absolutely fundamental aspect of game
design who knows but right now these are
experiences so anything other than their
highest end one is not gonna run
anything other than these first gen
experiences at anything resembling a
playable framerate buried it's not gonna
happen so like a game that comes out in
2020 with r-tx is not going to run the
RT X Ness well on a current gen card in
2020 2020 2021 actually 2020 is pretty
close okay let's say 2021 because like
it could be three years before they
release to follow up I don't know the
rate things are going
um so that's so there's actual dedicated
silicon in the chip for RTX yeah but
they know that this feature doesn't add
value for a lot of their customers so
I'm I was looking at it going okay they
went straight from ten to twenty they've
got this feature that costs them real
money
actually cost some money that they
actually have to charge you for I mean
they don't have to but they're not a
charity
so actually costs you money and for a
lot of people doesn't deliver
tangible value especially as you come
down from the upper tier of cards into
the lower ones so this makes sense now
rumors are circulating that Nvidia is
set to launch this is posted by Rob and
M on the forum a Geforce RT x 2060 and a
GT and the GTX 1160 in mid January some
say it will actually be an 11-6 TTI so
these new cards would be Turing GPUs but
different variants so there will be a tu
106 that's the 2060 and a tu 116 and
that is the GTX so that's what all the
RT X features cut out so it would have
the cheering shaders instead of ray
tracing which will remain exclusive to
our TX models
there's rumored to be no RT x 2050 which
would mean that these mid-range and
entry-level parts would be geforce 11
only so I would fully okay know what do
you think so will they go as far as then
so will they keep them segmented if you
want if you're a high-end gamer whatever
you pay for our TX you want that ray
tracing stuff in your battlefield 5 and
other games theoretically at some point
and then if your low-end gamer well
honestly the hardware wasn't gonna run
it anyway so get rekt you can just not
run our TX yeah or do you think that
they will actually offer a value
performance GTX option like an 1180 or
something like that I don't think
they're going to and I really wish they
did this whole thing differently both I
will say both ok I would like to hear
both of these stories so I don't think
they're gonna go back up necessarily no
I'm just kidding I am listening
wow it was a sponsor spot I was dealing
for playing problem and so I don't I
don't think they're gonna go back up for
one because I do think they want to keep
their high-end prices I do think they
want to keep their high-end prices as
like one kind of product they won't have
their one premiere product you don't
want to have like oh you don't like ray
tracing which we want to focus on but
you want to match some experiment have
like RT X and like GTX and like I don't
know LT X like light to light T X or
something
oh don't let me forget we have morning
Axios okay go ahead no I'm on it I think
what they should have done is kept the
mm whatever because people don't like
number variants check gets people really
confused sure and that's okay I think
they just as you go down the stack
should have switched to GTX okay
interesting but then what if they like
to be TX what if they wanted to have
like like eleven sixty and 2060 like
where they're both a sixty variant but
just with and without a feature because
suffixes used to be a thing like what
about a suffix or that yeah like I like
I hate that it's r-tx now I've screwed
that up a handful you could have you
could have a GTX 2060 R and you could
have a r TX 2060 you can have 22 26 th
and just have GTX RTSP I hate the
Suffolk alright I hate the previous I'd
rather have a suffix personally okay but
but we both agree no number change yes I
would have preferred if it so I'm
although I'm fine with us I don't
actually care which one I'm down with
the suffix like I just don't want I
don't like the number two the cynic in
me feels like this was a meeting where
they sat around thinking how do we make
this sound like a huge quantum leap
forward
I know let's go up to the first number
of 10,000 rather than 1000 or excuse me
1700 yeah like honestly that's what it
sounds like to me yeah um great great so
a great post on the floatplane chat
raiatea says I can almost count Luke's
beard hairs so you got a trim did you
not yeah how was that for you okay so if
you guys didn't notice my hair was my
hair and beard were a little ridiculous
because you still kind of look Reagan I
know which is the whole problem so did
you go to like like place next to the
far restaurant okay
there's a place I want to get my haircut
for actually years yeah and we don't
understand each other at all I started I
went and I showed them a picture of
Captain America in Captain America
Winter Soldier and I was like that and
then they just did it and it was great
and it all
looked great and then every time it
would be a new lady I'd just show her
the same google the same picture to show
her the same picture again it was always
like slightly different but it was more
or less great and then I grew it out for
a really long time so I wanted it to be
slightly longer and I want to have a
slightly longer beard when I went to
this really fancy bougie kind of place
and spent way more money than I was
comfortable with and got like a beard
trim and a nice haircut and the whole
time I was sitting there I was like I
don't think this is gonna be better at
all and then I left and like got home
and kind of looked at it closely and was
like I kind of look the same just like
ever so minorly cleaned up so I'm
probably going back to the ladies that I
can't understand
but it cost me like 11 dollars see
that's what my old haircut you surprised
so I'm going back there yeah actually
mine was particularly bad the last one
so guys if you look so I just got my
haircut
I think last weekend or something like
that or Monday or something boy whatever
it doesn't matter the point is if you
look at some of the most recent live
stuff in particular you'll probably be
able to tell that this side was like
noticeably longer like almost twice as
long as this side up around the top and
then I got the same hairdresser at the
great clips when I went in just recently
and she did the same thing so I had to I
hate to be that guy
I really hate it too but I was like she
was like yeah so she pulls out the
mirror I'm like hold on a minute with
the mirror there for a sec can we can we
that I didn't say it like this but like
could we have a look at how this side is
like and there's this excuse about how
it like grows different ways on either
side of my head and I'm like don't kiss
so here's the fundamentals of how
scissors work you take your fingers you
go like this you pull it up straight
away from the scalp and you slice it off
you just didn't do it it had nothing had
nothing to do with the directional air
was growing here's how your job works
like I'm gonna let you finish buttons if
I say that King Kanye come after me like
oh maybe who knows is being an asshole
trademark Abel
Cartman just has everything you know I
think Trey Parker and Matt Stone would
actually be cool about it though
probably I they have they ever gone
after anyone for like memeing their
jokes I have never heard of that
happening me and I'm not surprised it
doesn't seem like a venn thing I'm sure
if you like tried to make basically
exactly one of their episodes they would
probably get cheesed yeah like pretty
annoyed but they'd be more likely to
Lampoon you on an episode yeah
so let's do the iPad pros topic because
it's sort of the title otherwise I
probably wouldn't bother because Ed's
giving me a ride home and he just like
popped his head over here to see Cooper
um this was posted by Street guru on the
forum Apple has confirmed that some of
their 2018 iPad pros are shipping with a
very slight bend in the aluminum chassis
that's an interesting wording port
according to the company this is a side
effect of the devices manufacturing
process and shouldn't worsen over time
or negatively affect the flagship iPads
performance in any practical way Apple
does not consider it to be a defect
sweet the bend is a result of a cooling
process involving the iPad pros metal
and plastic components both sides of the
device can be affected and it seems to
be more pronounced on the LTE model as
there's a plastic strip that breaks up
the iPads flat aluminum sides some
people have mentioned that the text on
the full plain chat is a little bit
small and hard to see if you have eye
problems not a defect yeah it's a side
effect of the rendering process yeah as
it's going from your keyboard to your
browser and to other people's browsers
it may get smaller it's just the process
of our advanced manufacturing process in
all seriousness though that's great
feedback thank you yeah thank you
so Apple says it has not seen a higher
than normal return rate so far but the
only way for affected customers to
return their iPads now that they'd like
notice that it's bent is within the
14-day return windows so it should be no
problem to just buy six iPads
a flattest one and return the other five
but we're not saying you should do that
we're not saying where's my iPad at all
oh yeah cuz you could literally you
don't even have to just rapidly exchange
you could literally just buy a ton of
them yeah and then just no no no no no
this I mean that's one of the reasons
that I just can't take like open box
processor returns without charging
restocking fees because back in the day
when overclocking was like kind of more
of a thing people would go they would
buy like 20 30 processors they would
overclock them all see which one could
do it and something chuck they'd keep
really good ones they would flip them on
eBay or whatever and then they'd just
return the craptastic ones with open
boxes and it's like thermal compound all
over them
okay so the last thing for today I'm
going to LTX Expo com
we know it's redundant we don't care and
I'm going to the updates page
do you like the logo by the way yeah no
it's sharp I like it a lot oh do you
like this logo being on the same page
probably more than anyone could imagine
I'm actually so freaking excited so sign
up if you want to get this news or you
can just watch my own show because real
is little talk what every time talking
about it but explore Vancouver's turf
posted an update on the blog so we
understand that oh wait you have to
click it oh that's not actually that
obvious Wow
there's work to be done on the blog oh
ok so as part of our weekly plan so we
want to make sure that there's an update
every week from now on something so this
time being added something going on we
don't really have anything huge to share
on the blog so because it's a two-day
event this time because Vancouver during
the summer happens to just be a
beautiful place to come and visit and we
know that it's hard to justify coming
all the way out here just for a
convention or something like that we
just wanted to post some fun and cool
stuff to do here in the city but you
guys can check out while you're here
like don't just make it a two-day
in-and-out event come see our city come
enjoy it stay for a bit this is the
Capilano Suspension Bridge it's actually
a really like it's a little bit hard to
capture it's a really wonderful
experience it's pretty sick
sorry oh did you really yeah
Granville Island is a lot of fun if you
enjoy craft beers Vancouver is a
happenin scene for you want to make a
night of it and you go to ground vote
Granville Island you can go to a thing
called Vancouver theatre sports that's
where Ryan Stiles and one of the other
awesome dudes off of whose line is any
mockery Colin Mochrie out there start
really awesome yep so really really cool
stuff and also over on the LTX twitter
this is cool this is a this is an actual
update oh yeah
this is amazing this is our convention
space this year it is flippin huge you
moved it off swings slightly but it's
like 75 thousand know the the size oh oh
yeah ninety five thousand square feet
yeah 75,000 square feet baby it is going
to be something else we are hard at work
making sure that this year's event is
gonna be a huge step up we've already
talked to Bob and rod nice nothing is
like set in stone but we have we have
penciled in a way bigger booth for them
nice and they're gonna do some kind of
cool activation with respect to like
water cooling or PC modding or something
like that working with them we have a
crazy project so at the last two you
were able to try 16k gaming and 10k
gaming we had them there at the show
this year it's gonna be something really
different it's gonna be something way
cooler yeah I'll tell you more about it
off stream okay it's gonna be like sick
assume I'm assuming we can get it
working we should be able to get it
working I love how every time so far
there's always been like some crazy plan
that we like hope we can get working and
then like it's it up till the very night
of like it's like not working our
negative to it finally comes together
but but it makes it every time yeah
somehow somehow we keep pulling it off
so good so I want to do a couple super
chats here mate keep sending money hype
for LTS he's gonna be there names coming
yeah so yeah so him saying he's hyped he
got
plane tickets for Christmas or something
I don't member the exact details yeah
yeah see you there mate um oh boy
Tommy Gunn says Britain Channel super
fun back Jensen says Merry Christmas hi
Jensen merry Christmas to you too
hey MooMoo hey diamond sonic Oh sign up
before January 31st yeah okay
ah would you be willing to add sargon of
a CAD to floatplane
what is that political dude so we don't
have sleek so our policy with respect to
right wing left wing politics is as long
as what you're doing isn't illegal then
it's really none of our business
yeah ah Dan says have a good night I'll
catch up in the morning too late thanks
Dan ah Internet why on earth is
floatplane using firebase hey why not
like actually though he says please
consider using a bundler to bundle all
the assets on floatplane it'll improve
your load speed a lot yeah okay so
that's something we had something okay
other side guy turn the Lamborghini into
an insane track day car oh boy we also
have plans for like like ways to use the
bundler that will be better and yeah
that was something we wanted to do with
it
we actually had a sponsor mostly lined
up that they ended up we ended up still
doing something with them it was way
less cool frankly I'm not gonna name any
names cuz like they're a partner and
like I'm not trying to like crap on them
or anything but they made the wrong call
I know uh what else we got here Oh
readeth floatplane cast button is that
like easy or hard
pretty sure it's already a thing oh well
um what about on live stream though oh
that's yeah it's definitely not here
casting from your left yeah how would
that work
pretty sure it's there on a phone I
don't know about a live stream though I
know I know vods has a casting button I
don't know if live stream has a casting
button
sorry any thoughts of me it is I really
it is yeah any thoughts of making an app
for Android also looking great from
Japan someone sent a super chat because
through YouTube but they're watching on
floatplane an app is definitely on our
radar we'd have to be complete idiots to
not have thought of you know we should
we have an app the problem for us is
that really the the hard work of what
we're doing is on the back end building
out a scalable platform for delivering
vods and live streams that is not based
on AWS so it doesn't have the cost boat
anchor that comes along with that it's
not easy there are like container apps
where we just like containerize the
website and it's just like on the
desktop of your phone but like anyone
can do that at any time it's not really
we do want a dedicated app at some point
which will run faster and be better and
whatnot but not now thanks Traip 333 oh
holy crap the whole thing is like
blowing up right now
Disney is currently being sued for
hakuna matata are you serious right now
that's amazing it's not even real yeah
oh the floss one they're being sued over
that one too yeah I know about the kid
who like went viral with it and whatever
nice why not
nearly 45,000 people signed a petition
accusing Disney of colonialism and
robbery for trademarking the Swahili
phrase Hakuna Matata made famous in the
Lion King
oh they trademarked it is a tipping
point in Disney's portrayal of Africa is
a cultural appropriation petition claims
that doesn't sound like an actual
lawsuit that's a petition okay and
lightened Apple fanboy when do we get to
meet Janice okay so um we are going to
do a a meatless so we do these exclusive
videos for flow planner don't meet the
team next time Janice is in and not busy
I will sit her down and do the interview
so so I guess late January probably not
now this guy who's care
as I don't know how to pronounce my
issue is some persons dance moving game
would be fine if it was free but epic
charges money for something they didn't
invent that is sketchy I think this is
gonna be pretty tough to enforce though
why don't you guys do 90-minute shows
anymore because we never get started at
4:30 that's still when we try and we're
just always like today we were later and
there's way less news now yeah that's
true
someone posted on a will you be
reviewing 1 + 7 next year presumably
yeah ok ok so there was one thing on
foot 1 floatplane comment but I wanted
to address highlight it or something
I don't remember too late alright I've
seen a few and I yeah I know I'll leave
this off I think so we talked about the
story we talked with a story guy yeah
but some people did ask about my shirt
yeah this is this is a t-shirt it is
official email - t-shirt you can get it
on the website along with other LT
t-shirts that look great oh I like this
one a lot actually this is very cool so
one one thing that's cool about this
shirt is I know some people myself
included don't always want like super
hardcore branding on things so with this
shirt you can support the channel and
buy a shirt that just looks really cool
on its own and this part at least has it
has a little ltte in it but it's just
like dots within the constellations and
there's lots of other dots too want to
see a fun Easter Egg sure look at my
pupils whoa
either I'm high as a kite how high are
you or or I had an eye doctor
appointment that morning oh I was trying
so hard to not like every time Brandon
had to snap a shot of me during this
shoot I was like okay I'm ready I was
due they had to put drops in to dilate
me oh yeah you look super so I had to go
in for an eye scan Wow so that's a final
notice do you just point that over from
I know I
didn't pointed it out when I was
shooting a video he's like yo you look
blazed as hell man yeah whether you want
like the classic logo t-shirt or one
that's just called constellations do we
have a zoom in on this so people
actually see it yeah we should we should
show there it is there so you can see
there's like little lines drawn between
the constellations and if you're really
paying attention you can notice an LTT
there you don't have to pay attention I
can point it out for you there you
haven't seen it yet it's very subtle so
if you want a really subtle way to
support and have a cool really
comfortable nice quality teacher you can
go with that or you can go with one of
the more like clearly hey guys I like
Linus tech tips shirts
cable ties cable ties wait do we have
actually just fully okay they put them
on orange cables that actually looks
really sharp yep all right so that's it
for the wind show for this week that
would kind of make sense this is the
weekend before um yeah yeah sure why not
okay so we've done something really
special this was a James initiative for
the most part like he was really
championing this project hardcore but he
got a lot of help Brandon
my understanding is sat out there with
him for literally hours working on this
project oh I'm on the wrong server right
now give me a second I'm just gonna see
if I can play some of it off the server
here Edie
actually also gave him a lot of help a
lot of people on the team pitched in to
try and help get this thing exported
because basically he had a goal he had a
dream to create the world's first 8k
Yule Log and it might is it actually the
world's first I have no idea but it's
it's it's really good it's actually
pretty cool a very early so there's a
bit of
ooh here and that is that a lot of the
files here are very broken so I'm hoping
there's one that I can actually play
there also a lot of them very very high
bitrate and I think my poor laptop is
going to cry oh wow but it is very very
you'll log we're very LTT don't don't
don't
and it's anywhere from how long is the
we wanted to do ten hours we wanted to
do a 10 hour 8k Yule Log and I think
we've dialed it back to I'm not I'm not
sure yep there's fun Easter eggs you can
hear his laptops like the fans are
spinning up and it's lagging a little
bit and this is great yeah yeah my
laptop is is feeling the burn right now
here oh my goodness you can't even open
yeah CPU is slammed GPU is GPU is
hurting oh my goodness yeah
I have 11 gigs of RAM in use and all I'm
doing is well I do have chrome tabs open
but I'm just watching a video people are
asking how large the file is well the so
the ten-hour file was over a terabyte
that was ProRes though so we've run into
like all kinds of issues like export
issues stability issues YouTube file
limit issues we didn't know they had a
file size limit but they do what is it
it's 125 gigabytes okay yeah so there
you go you're tuning in see you again
next week same bat-time same bat-channel
I think the Yule Log is coming tonight
