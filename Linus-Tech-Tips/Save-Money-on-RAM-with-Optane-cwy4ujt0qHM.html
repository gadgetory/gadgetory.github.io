370 motherboard check to ram one stick
what the devil is all around and that's
actually a terrific question
DRAM has been in a global shortage
allegedly due to collusion between the
major producers for months
so when Intel reached out asking for
some creative ideas for a sponsored
video we pitched using their obtained
caching modules as a way of topping up
your system memory and for some reason
pink green witness so let's give it a
shot
so obviously we're still gonna need some
system memory but the plan really is to
take this and use it to replace some of
this and the rationale behind this is
actually a lot less crazy than you'd
think in our testing we've seen that
obtain performs more like Ram than it
does like an SSD which is to say that
it's got ridiculously low response times
compared to this all while being much
cheaper than this and conveniently even
though our obtain module here plugs into
an m dot 2 slot so this is something
that is designed for an SSD windows
already has functionality that lets us
use a regular old storage device as an
extension of the system memory so we
will give up quite a lot of our
throughput compared to actual Ram but
for small transactions that might not
actually hurt us that much and it will
certainly be faster than using a
traditional nvme or SATA SSD or heaven
forbid a hard drive in this roll to put
this theory to the test we're gonna do
something a little bit strange so we've
actually installed two eight gig sticks
of memory in our bench to give us the
benefit of dual Channel but then we're
gonna use Windows as built in MS config
utility to artificially limit our memory
to four gigs without a plus sign in
there so our four gig entry actually
gives us just shy of three gigs of
usable memory all right
let's fire up some gaming benchmarks
these numbers actually start out showing
little concern for the lack of available
RAM
however in the open world far cry 5 we
see a significant drop in 97th
percentile frame rates as assets load in
on-the-fly as for Unigine super
we did see a small dip but that could
just be due to run to run variation
moving on to productivity things get
painful Adobe Premiere took a whopping
three times longer than our native 16
gig tests and blender is much the same
story taking over two hours to complete
where our non limited testing gave us a
result under 45 minutes let's hope for
Intel's sake that things go a little bit
better with obtain unsurprisingly our
gaming results don't really change much
though we do gain back most of our 97th
percentile frames on far cry 5 compared
to the three gig test and Unigine
superposition did pick up a cool 33
points of probably run two run variants
moving on to productivity things look
well actually a lot better we shave
about a minute off of Adobe Premiere
though we didn't get that close to true
Ram but as for blender Wow
blender took a whole hour off the render
time I mean to be clear that's still 25
and a half minutes longer than if we had
all just ramped but considering that
this render calls for a minimum of 12
gigs of ram and takes about 12 and a
half we know that a considerable amount
of our working data was sitting in our
octane module but that's only part of
the story let's take an even closer look
at these results what you're looking at
now is a scatterplot of frame x and the
corresponding disk activity where we can
see that most of our spikes in
instantaneous frame x so these would be
perceived as hitches are actually caused
by spikes in activity and this is
especially evident when we look at Far
Cry 5 we can also look at how they're
really
ship works between drive activity and
CPU usage during our premier and blender
tests where we can see well mostly a
mess but but squint harder look at this
the dips and drive activity actually
correspond to spikes in CPU usage
meaning our CPU is being kept fed so the
less a drive Thresh's the more our CPU
gets to work nowhere is this more
apparent than our blender test where our
non obtain result had the CPU working at
below 50% capacity most of the time so
what can we take away here well for one
obtain memory modules aren't going to be
replacing system Ram anytime soon but
think of the potential out of necessity
it's common practice for computing
workloads to be coated around the
availability of modern hardware so we
needed to create a pretty contrived
experiment to show such a clear benefit
today but imagine if developers or
creative types or researchers were free
to create much larger data sets knowing
that they'd have a cost-effective way to
work around bottlenecking their cpu we
actually saw this in action in our
obtain 900p video so for today we're
still recommending octane modules for
accelerating slower storage devices like
hard drives but this was a really fun
exercise in future crafting and it
really shows off the potential of the
underlying octane memory so thanks for
watching guys if you disliked this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit like get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description again to accelerate
other storage not to replace your system
memory while you're down there you can
check out our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum it's kind of a cool place to hang
out
