there's nothing I can do to prevent you
guys from tuning in yeah that's true you
could prevent them from talking the chat
I can make them watch me eat because I
haven't had a chance to have lunch today
a lot of people going to complain about
that I know people don't like it when
you eat which is why I'm only going to
take one bite so that I can generate the
complaints but I'm not actually being
that terrible of a person oh okay
can you explain me why it's terrible
though I've actually never understood
because okay yeah but if you avoid that
so much secretively words oh boy alright
yeah we've got a great show for you guys
today my combs frozen because he's the
garbage and otherwise I would tell you
what what we have for you oh there was a
long-lost Starcraft Gold source code
that was found apparently this source
code disc was lost so they had to start
on Starcraft from scratch and the reward
that the guy got for finding it is like
junk tear yeah I know right a lot of the
topics are like a handsomely rewarded
I'm like not it oh wow yeah more like
got fisted yeah a little bit not cool
okay well so you thinking about getting
fisted you could come to LTX 2017 which
is a limas Texas meetup that we are
hosting locally which should be super
fun
if you enjoys our marriage so we'll talk
more about that later we're gonna
address the LTTE thousand dollar build
guide that some of you are feeling kind
of fisted about now this is becoming a
bit of a common theme yeah and finally
AMD fisting their customers yes by
making money from their drivers yeah
alright so we'll get to that and more at
eleven
little asterisk after the eleven and
it's like eleven is good every time you
were one yeah that's right
but like later than that moment because
we haven't started yet
all right we'll be watching live and
using the code now instead of waiting
for the integration and Backblaze we
have due today
that's fun yes my friend we do all right
so let's go ahead and go back to us and
I'm gonna try and wow Mike Rome is so
broken what am I supposed to do I can
post the topics in the chat you can get
the links from the chat wow I guess that
doesn't Wow what the crap Firefox do it
no it's not I would not be frozen I
would if it was going to be better but
it won't be oh that's just my personal
stuff don't worry about it he saw my my
secret tab of quad socket motherboard
that I like to look at late at night
you're working out are you good yeah I
think I've closed enough of enough of my
tabs built solely the gram 14 doesn't
have a 16 Oh gram 14 doesn't have a 16
gig SKU available even though it just
has a sodium slot so what I was planning
to do was take the gram 15 and the gram
14 swapped the sodium and then kind of
you know whistle and walk away kind of
thing because I really like the 14 I
don't need the number pad and I find the
screens big enough this is what I've
been using as my daily driver lately
actually but I've just been lazy and
what is this what oh it says I'm angry
about video games oh okay okay okay I
thought you I thought it was a lead-in
to no it's not not having enough RAM for
all my pad model where is what okay all
right
all right what do I wanted to start with
which which witness area is the most
important fisting or we can talk about
AMD so people are like wow that's crazy
and then we can talk about lpx and so
people won't be as upset about about us
screwing them yeah look I love it okay
thanks you got it you're gonna take this
pole
with a grain of salt because Zee me Oh
bless his or her heart I don't know if
the mule is a dude or a gal but gmail is
not probably the world's most objective
observer when it comes to AMD and Intel
it's kind of like expecting good bytes
on the forum to say something anti
microbiome I guess yeah yeah we're not
calling you guys fanboys because we
don't know if you're male huh we never
have to worry about Microsoft News
showing up on the forum though because
it will always be there any websites
we'll make sure that it is there that's
right yeah we appreciate actually all
the anti Mike are all the anti AMD and
Pro Intel news and pro Microsoft news
that we can rest assured we'll make it
into the tech news section of the forum
alright so the original article here is
actually from tech power up and in a
nutshell what it appears as though AMD
is doing in that when you install their
17.4 dot for driver
it appears that with a bitly so we did
talk about this last week yeah so
there's a quake champion you did yes
that's how James told you that he came
downstairs and asked me he's like did
you talk about this last week and I was
like yes he was like okay cook Lance
wants it in the thing and I was like we
totally why do we even want it you know
what forget it no I quit
no I'm not doing this podcast anymore
all right well if you want to see Linus
in person so that he can go okay you
know what I quit and first no I want to
talk I want to talk about this okay I
want to talk about this because because
I'm mad oh this is dumb yeah I think it
stopped it oh they didn't I'm pretty
sure okay then I'm over it alright fine
let's talk about something else
no I 100% sure but I'm pretty sure
there's like almost no notes so but I if
I remember from last week they were like
oh wow we didn't realize how much do you
guys would care if we were ridiculously
annoying and put bloatware on your
computer right and I pulled it I think
that's what happened all right let's
talk about LTX so basically if you were
thinking to yourself gee these guys
aren't annoying enough over the Internet
I like to be annoyed in person and you
need you need to have Karen explained
about macros and hotkeys in person then
this is the event for you are we doing
the dunk tank thing I have no idea so
basically it's kind of this half-baked
uh Wow sort of condom ad on it right now
well okay okay okay okay okay do you
want me to okay so you want me to talk
about the half-baked stuff first or the
cool stuff first I mean let's get the
half-baked or the way okay we started
so it's half-baked in the sense that
it's two months away and we haven't
actually locked down a single sponsor
for the event yet okay
all right is the idea behind it we're
actually red so so there's not
half-baked stuff we are actually renting
an arena so then as far as I've heard
yeah there will be a small-sized kiddy
pool without anything in it and a ball
pit so will be at least that good there
will be at least that okay and it'll be
in an arena yeah some people will
recognize that room um but like the
arena is really expensive so in addition
to admission and we actually can't even
fit that many people we're limited to
somewhere in the neighborhood of like
yeah there you go so just over a
thousand people because we can't really
use because it's in like a medium so we
can't really use any of the seating
because there's nothing that you would
really sit there yeah yeah like me like
maybe we could have a few rows out of
people just want to go sit down but like
not the idea and there's but and there's
also going to be like like potentially
maybe like a lounge that you could do
that okay yeah yeah yeah
but but basically it would be like the
size of a hockey rink down at the bottom
of what is actually a hockey rink if
this was so if it's not ready and we
don't have sponsors and stuff yet yeah
why wouldn't we have just pushed it out
um because we want to do it in the some
where and also if we didn't set a
deadline doors if we didn't set a
deadline we just never do it that's also
fair yeah so we decided to set a
deadline
that will almost definitely happen so
what is so the question burning in
everyone's minds is probably what is a
tech carnival yeah it's a cross between
a con like a AB convention vention I was
thinking I had conference popping in
perhaps is not a conference cousin runs
a combination between a convention oh
yeah we also have meetup in there so see
Meetup it's a convention it's a meetup
make a carnival yeah so it's the vision
is this we wanted to do something that's
a little bit different and so I kind of
went you know what was fun when I was a
kid
carnivals the school carnival the
fundraiser carnival this is good okay
yeah no that's right yeah they were it
would be like stupid like gambling games
but not for actual money you just get
like we do whatever those but themed to
computer stuff so the idea is that every
manufacturer who wants to partner with
us to sponsor a booth they don't
actually have to pay a ton of money like
in the grand scheme of things compared
to what they would be accustomed to for
a convention like booth space because
the booths aren't going to be that like
amazing or anything they're just going
to be centered around these carnival
ideas so some of the ideas we have is we
want some kind of a gaming manufacturer
to come in and equip Edie and a
competitor of who presumably would wait
in line to take him on and you have to
beat at it csgo yeah and there might be
some kind of a leader very hard he's
good or it would enter you into some
kind of a draw in order to have a chance
to win something really cool that would
be provided by that manufacturer other
ideas include things like we want a case
guy to come in and with how many cool
people there are in the case industry
we're pretty sure this is not going to
be a problem but we want a case guy to
come in and sponsor the case toss so
again it would be like a leaderboard
type thing and we take maybe the top
five people throughout the course of the
day obviously it's the kind of thing
that would be pretty funny to watch
people taking computer cases and
basically shot-putting them as far as
they can yeah no the idea is just good
kind of pure fun goofing around
maybe there also be some demos from some
cool tech like that case manufacturer
might bring a couple to not throw so you
could maybe look at their latest cases
maybe um and then the LMG staff all of
us I believe we've called like an
all-hands-on-deck thing one it's not
gonna make it well the one that doesn't
work here oh oh I don't know
so although he might okay so most Linus
Media Group staff will be there so if
you wanted to I mean honestly one of the
ideas for a booth that I was honestly
thinking of was Karen tutoring people in
Premiere I could totally like if I went
to a convention I would definitely stop
by there I don't know if I'd say there
the whole time because I'd be like wow I
want to go do other things eventually
but like yeah but like but like if you
could do like like a like a three-hour
thing or I'm like take questions every
like half an hour or something one idea
I had was he could actually be editing
an LTT video throughout the day on new
girls quick and you could just ask
questions and we wouldn't expect them to
necessarily even finish it that day
because he'd be interrupted constantly
yeah but that was another thing that I
thought might be kind of like a cool
behind-the-scenes thing that would
otherwise be impossible to experience
yeah so I would I would like that I
think that's cool that's the tech
carnival it's 30 bucks for a pass and
then 75 if you want a special edition
lanyard a t-shirt and a 6-month
floatplane Club membership for one week
of early access oh I don't have that
screen show hello or their commute these
are Canadian dollars so yeah so that's
basically like 22 US dollars or
something like that and then like 60
bucks 60 bucks u.s. and that's actually
a pretty good deal if you were going to
get floatplane anyway because it's three
bucks a month times six is eighteen
dollars a t-shirt I don't know what's
that worth 20 bucks anyway we think the
the big package we think the big package
is kind of the one to go for so there
you go that's the explanation I'm going
to go look
twitch chatham like cringing because I'm
pretty sure hey cold never even sold me
tickets yet yeah call me we have ready
go
he went upstairs but we have sold
tickets oh we have i know roughly how
many but i don't know if we wanted to
say that or not sure yeah by not about a
hundred
oh really yeah let when i don't know oh
within the time the video went up and
now oh because we posted oh we posted it
on social and uh yeah ha ticket sales
how are we doing is anyone coming yeah
150 now
oh so people are coming then alright the
really big one have we sold the the $500
VIP experience oh we think getting sold
on that one okay okay that's cool go
figure every time that we've done one of
these things like with the first blood
campaign way back in the day and with
the forum badges that were like custom
form badges yeah we've always had a
every single time exactly $500 tier that
was just like ridiculous didn't really
the first time especially we really
didn't expect anyone to buy it and for
some reason someone does every time
every time so we were like okay sure
this time though we were trying to come
up with something that's a little bit
cooler than like I mean the dab is
actually like like pretty bad algae and
you can't get them anymore some people
that do happen to have them are like
they're the only ones who can get them
so that's all like cool but we were
thinking if you're going to be all the
way out here this time that package
includes a limo ride to the office and
and a one on one well one on 10 I guess
depending how many people get it there's
max return yeah maximum 10 yeah so that
I think that's pretty nifty I don't I
mean you work here every day I'm sure
you wouldn't pay for it like I wouldn't
have paid for it anyways I'm really
cheap you alright to me I would yeah I
might get the one with the shirt because
I like commemorative shirts I have a few
packs shirts you get a lanyard - yeah
alright
anyway you know what I'd I mean I'd uh I
never know what's going on around here
anymore like I don't even know how to
check how many tickets are sold but
LTX good idea or bad idea okay so we're
going full Animaniacs here okay those
are the only options Wow
are we abandoning turnip it's been a
long time we're abandoning turnip okay
yeah I'm over it all right Peter no rip
turn it turn yeah turnips not funny
anymore now that there's one in the
sorry yeah forgot what I was talking
about yeah okay so let's go ahead get
those results up and move on to our next
news topic okay AMD's stock price Oh
more than 20% in a single that you know
you know how close I was to investing in
AMD when I saw how good Rison was going
to be well maybe now you should well no
because I was worried about a couple
things so number one is I wasn't sure if
that's in weight or animation yeah I
don't know yeah because it's under
embargo so even though it's not like
that much of a secret there were like
four hundred people in the room with me
I'm not sure if that's still considered
insider so I guess so if there's an NDA
probably so I'm so but but what I could
do is I could wait till the embargo is
lifted then it's common knowledge and
then I could just with superhuman speed
I could I could buy a new sock like the
second lid so I could skirt around that
but the other concern was that I've
avoided owning shares in any tech
company this whole point the entire time
that since we've been independent yeah
so I did buy shares in Nvidia once and I
held them for a couple of months
actually made like a pretty good chunk
of money but that wasn't based on a
significant tip or anything it was just
based on kind of like the ebb and flow
and I was like yeah I really couldn't go
any lower and then I did okay and I got
out because it stresses me out yeah and
then I made a few bucks on ocz back when
they were like going gangbusters and I
was like okay I'll go in four and I was
in for like three weeks okay that's it
all right
that's all I've never gotten involved in
but the thing is like I I worry that
even if I disclosed it the number of
people who think that I am that I can be
I can be bought and that I can be biased
by a graphics card
I mean imagine what they would think if
I owned shares in the company the one
thing that I was thinking was that I
could get around it by buying everything
ha ha ha ha and just hopefully the tech
industry just goes up yes yeah look if
I'm if I'm just betting on that but then
then okay you'd get the tinfoil hats
coming in there he's just talking about
how amazing tech is because it makes
their money if the tech industry grows
so I've just been like you know what as
as far as as far as high-profile
companies go anyway I'm just not going
to get involved but that doesn't mean
that I might not make some kind of
investment in a tech company and that's
actually something that would be like a
private thing that I might might be
closing soon so I would definitely be
talking to you guys about anyway shares
of AMD plunged on Tuesday following a
first quarter report that failed to
justify the stocks 300 percent gain last
year whoops
AMD reported strong results that were in
line with expectations but hey that's
the thing is like they still lost money
like what were people expecting were
they directing AMD to go from losing at
what was it like 73 million in the last
quarter last q1 and then they lost 29
million this time which is like a lot
better but we're expecting them to go
from losing 72 million to being
profitable um
but only losing 29 million dollars is
still insane well yes like oh yeah um so
they're still hope though rising
processors had only been shipping for
one month of the quarter and Vega is
also slated for release sometime in q2
Naples that's where we might actually
see some significant improvements if
they manage to win some big bids with
Naples and they managed to get some
design wins and like super computers or
whatever the case may be that could be a
big deal and then rise in 3
processors are also slated for the
second half of the year which could help
boost up volumes significantly because
value chips that is where you are going
to be shifting units speaking of
supercomputers I'm doing an unboxing of
a supercomputer next week under ring I
don't I don't know what to call it
but basically this place is bananas
what's up that thing
am I going not that one I'm going to
that one okay so we're also trying this
isn't confirmed yet they've expressed
interest and they're like yeah let's do
it and then like it's the oldest the
whole yeah let's do it radio silence
yeah yeah but like they're into it
but Luke and I want to go tour it turns
out that d-wave the quantum computer
maker the B quantum computer
manufacturer is based out of Burnaby
British Columbia
yeah they're like not even remotely far
drive away no it's like 30 minutes like
I used to live there yeah so so we've
talked to them about doing like a
hands-on yeah
with a quantum computer I'll be pretty
cool that would be really excited it'll
be dope as the kid says ah yes
dank even dank know I thought dank is
bad and aren't dank memes like outdated
means no dank memes are like super good
memes dope and dank are both good
facepalm is still based on playback yes
okay yeah yeah facepalm and so much hate
so much hate is getting a little yeah I
know I don't but I can say shake my head
so everything H is still okay I just
have to think it doesn't mean so much
hates ya got ya got it no problem I'm on
this I'm trying to I'm trying to keep on
top of it I've got the Star Wars memes
prequel means I'm on top of that good
job Josh
oh you're officially the worst sidekick
ever most of them are like hello there
Kenobi from G grievous don't worry about
it it's fine it's fine fine
alright the red arm evidently okay I'm
gonna off suit for a second here sure I
sent out V like emails to the people
that were graded very highly for their
resumes and stuff for the full plank
oh and hey just later on memes you've
got to be kidding I was reading a
comment on your call for coders video
that said that this platform is a
disaster waiting to happen and no one
would be stupid enough to apply oh there
was a lot of those one people applied
you've got to be kidding me a lot of
people the huge amount of people applied
it took me a really long time to go
through all their resumes there's a lot
of misconceptions as to like how we were
building the platform a lot of people
think that we're doing literally every
single thing in node which is like
extremely untrue I got people sending me
like entire essays on how we shouldn't
be transcoding video with node and a mic
we actually already have that part
working don't know where you got that
from we're not doing that I don't know
but yeah there's a lot of applicants who
are really good at also a lot of people
telling us that we're crazy to be trying
to build okay we're a lot of hold on
hold on hold on to be trying to build
this object with one developer yeah and
I love that you were getting labeled
idea guy yeah what's it called it's
called an idea man right where you have
where you have like the idea for the
next great social media platform only
you don't know any coding okay so two
things number one we would say anywhere
in the video were hiring one person we
already had number two we don't say
anywhere in the video that we don't
already have people yes and number three
a little bit I'm not I'm not as good as
the people I'm trying to hire that has
been made abundantly clear because some
of you are extremely good but I I can do
I can do something knows more than me
let's put it that way yeah I've been
taking like refresher courses and stuff
I'm not going to be the boss guy that
doesn't know how to code
I still get I get a little embarrassed
by boiler sometimes when he's like okay
this is how this works and were just
like oh cheese but yeah I'm going to be
taking more refresher courses and stuff
we have mr. boiler cat boiler on the
forums I'm going to call mr. boiler
because cat boiler is like a little
awful a little bit weird I mean he's a
full-time employee has been for a while
now he's been working on the project for
like
a little bit more than six months so
didn't some work going on there that's
another thing you guys you guys you guys
won't be able to launch this for a year
and a half okay we're good we're working
on it
there's other guys as well Colonel
mortis from the forum has been helping a
bunch and it's going to be helping more
in a little bit from now I actually
haven't sent a reply to that message but
yes sounds good there you go
we'll send a more formal reply later and
there's like a couple other people that
have been putting a lot of work into
this
there's also another guy that we're
including a contract very soon for like
a while and hopefully making him an
employee at some point like you are not
alone yeah so yeah it's going to be
which was again infuriating and sort of
hilarious because in the video I'm like
you're gonna have to work with these
people this whole list of people like
why are you only hiring one person's
like oh my goodness oh this is great
this project is very naive this is
coming from an experienced coder for six
years
oh man six years Wow I'm so impressed
Wow okay here's the other thing that
people don't really seem to understand
what the project is this project is
already working yes people are so
concerned because boilers are gone
people are so concerned about the
financial model the project is already
really working yeah and there's like a
lot more that we can do we're gonna be
okay yeah like a lot of people were like
genuinely concerned that we were gonna
like God that we were going to hang on
oMG take on YouTube that is not and that
we had gone crazy this is not the goal
oh we want to be like this cool add-on
so that during these uneasy times of
weird ad revenue and like issues that
people are having with their channels
that can have something a little bit
more stable that they can stand on and
still push as hard as they've ever
pushed to grow their YouTube audience
because that will be no matter what I
say our try will be their main platform
and we
wanted to be their main platform because
the more they grow that the more they
will hopefully also grow their
floatplane audience
okay so let's totally change gears and I
don't know if I'm allowed to do this but
I think I'm gonna do it anyway
I need to get a screenshot of that guy
saying it's naive I've been I've been
screenshotting a lot of people's
aggressive comments not in like a while
I can try to look up their user names
and go like hey so what do you think
okay do you guys want to see premiering
on the wind show this trailer have you
seen this I have seen it I haven't seen
you haven't seen them know you're doing
trailer head dude okay hold on hold on I
just I want to check and make sure the
audio is working I don't have my
headphones here so I just want to make
sure I'm on the right playback device
and everything yeah so theoretically
theoretically this is working okay all
these people will see you before me
because I can't even hear it
Deepti the trailer for scrapyard wars
season 5 oh my goodness
hopefully the audio is working hopefully
it's not too loud hopefully I don't have
headphones I have no way of knowing well
whatever it'll be it'll be uploaded at
some point later but here we go here we
go here we go
I wonder what they're saying sorry dude
wow we look so serious
that's the $6,000 part
oh yeah be pretty cereal
the hype is real cool I hope I have no
idea
wait so we do mention the really
expensive part in the world that we
don't explain all apparently there's no
audio oh I was in the same boat
everyone's on the same boat as living
you still have to what you still have to
watch the actual trailer okay okay do it
okay I can't hold on hold on hold on
okay let's hit it with a straw pole hit
it with a straw poll do you guys want to
see it again with sound so why didn't it
have sound actually you know what twitch
ad just let me know do you want to see
it again
or like at all pre-recorded yes of
course okay yeah okay all right all
right all right around around around
around her and I get the point I'm
working on it okay okay so I'm just
gonna throw it was beginning yeah stop
stop ok the audio debut
the audio is gonna be kind of crap
because I forgot I don't have it set up
properly right now but I'm just gonna
hold this up to the microphone and we'll
just have to call that good enough okay
run away from the boy okay I'm sorry
everybody I'm sorry everybody okay here
we go here we go here we go we're going
again we're going again hold on hold on
okay pictures don't screen interesting
yeah yeah oh don't know I got this I got
this I got this I got this okay okay
here we go oh wait hold on I'll get our
ugly mugs out of the way okay oh why
didn't my trackpad working okay okay
ah here we go honestly the low points of
yesterday we're yeah probably a
fistfight feels like we haven't done
anything like when we went to leave
paint sandwiches which was delicious I
don't regret that Kyle has some
strategic he's working on right now
screw you took today Jeff over the phone
reasonable that seems like if we don't
have another choice we're going to have
to go for it so yeah so we have 45
minutes just get the out of here oh
man
so they don't know what might have cost
us $6,000 no they don't um yeah so the
hype the hype is super real I'm so
excited here but this fist place I know
the sound is not that great I'm sorry
but uh yeah no profanity
this this season is going to be a lot of
fun we're doing it really differently on
the post side of things you guys may or
may not have noticed we filmed like a
month ago yeah that was a conscious
decision real actual like on a show work
went into mapping out the episodes so
the pacing is a little bit better than
before and the idea is that the entire
season will be pretty much cut and then
every episode gets a week of polish
instead of like expecting the entire
episode to be edited in a week yeah cool
nice that's good
Danny I'm very good that's a pretty hype
trailer man I know at this point I want
to see boxing I haven't seen the other
side yeah me neither
I've no idea there's one thing that we
know about that I'm not gonna spoiler
because you guys just got enough
spoilers I think that involves Kyle that
I'm so excited I only heard about I know
we've only like yeah like oh my good I'm
as excited to watch this even though I
part it even though I'll know half the
story yeah
is it ah it's crazy yeah alright I mixed
hmm almost spoil it a little bit okay
yeah I'll try before don't spoil it V
judge okay to watch I have a crazy I
have a crazy thing to ask you okay could
it be in 4k on full plane oh why did you
why did you do that on the street
mysterious um probably not well I'll
talk to boiler about it but probably not
having been downloads be in 4k I think
would be really brutal gotcha okay um I
will talk to boiler wolf he's might even
be watching right now
sorry boiler I'm sorry boiler I'm gonna
leave that completed don't okay I
thought you're gonna do a straw poll no
no I'm not only just for all poll to see
if people want of course they want it
even if okay even if there's no 4k
drop-down option the 1080p looks from a
1080p we've so all my friends called me
they told me slow playing 1080p looks as
good or better than YouTube 4k we have a
debt it's adaptive bitrate
so like sometimes it almost always looks
a noticeable amount better than
YouTube's 4k but not technically always
right depending on like what is going on
in the video got it yeah all right so
let's finally get back to that straw
poll so okay actually that's interesting
apparently the majority of our audience
does seem to think that LTX is a good
idea now with that said only 840 people
voted which is really not that many for
a LAN show straw poll so if we were to
leave video if we were to add yeah it's
up if we were to add people who are
indifferent who would normally vote on a
straw poll right and don't then the
numbers don't look so good but I mean
realistically how about people being
indifferent about like PACs existing is
a really high percentage yeah that's
true that a really high amount of people
go mmhmm mmhmm yes to be fair it's a
very different type of convention yep
whereas this is more like kind of like a
casual like grow out and get together
well some people so a lot of people in
chat don't know what else
is oh they weren't here at the beginning
right LTX is Linus tech Expo Expo yeah
yeah no it's not called Expo no it's
carnival yeah
don't worry about it helps LPC LPC I
don't know but then that's a really
weird I just got some someone walks into
my office in like YouTube we call this
I'm like yeah paipai huh see so I is a
convention carnival thing that we're
going holdin very close to here where
everyone can meet us and do some cool
computer related activities and maybe
there will be some brands there yadda
yadda so forth all right people I do
that all John when you're not here
oh really yeah I have to do the same
thing I'm so pain enough glorious
planted well I think I think the idea is
you're right at the edge of the table
yeah and so that this person naturally
like floats to the edge of the table
right okay that's not the right framing
all right
AMD and the original article here is
from game debate calm no it's not in
Seattle we live in Canada it's gonna be
you know exactly where it is Langley
Event Center yeah so it's Langley Event
Center yeah in Langley if you live in
like the Lower Mainland or Greater
Vancouver area it's pretty easy to get
to this RFI way okay so allegedly AMD's
Radeon rx Vega specifications leaked in
a Linux driver update dun dun da alright
so this is a first update adding
comprehensive Vega feature support to
Linux now it was issued yesterday
whenever that yesterday would have been
so it depends when you're watching this
but basically 14 nanometer 4096 stream
processors 12.5 teraflops of performance
and that's 25 at FP 16 okay
64 ROPS 256 texture mapping units eight
Hardware threads a 2048-bit memory
interface so that looks like some kind
of HBM nonsense oh yeah there you go
eight gigs of HBM - okay is this real I
don't know maybe maybe not
but uh it doesn't sound that far
doesn't sound like one of those leaks
that's just like made by name defend was
put right
sorry to give member Mama's like we saw
their announcement NAB diners will
consumer card yeah no we're still trying
to get one of those duel cards but I'm
still not sure if we're going to be able
to because it's like not consumer Nvidia
like it's funny both AMD and NVIDIA are
kind of funny about some cards like in
video won't even respond to my emails
asking if we can borrow a Titan X P P
you could just say no like and then the
other station ends is in report Facebook
oh yeah okay I'll try that yeah okay
this is great news so the original
article here is from nine to five Mac I
love this because how bullcrap is it
when you buy something and it breaks
like right away no fault of your own you
take it to the store or worse yet the
manufacturer where they have no excuse
and they give you a refurbished part
it's free and it's pretty freaking
annoying I'd be pissed off personally
like if I paid for it bought a new one
yeah and it was in great condition and
I'm someone who cares about my devices
and if this one's got like even some
small scratches on it like okay yes
functionally it's probably the same and
you're sharing I want to talk to anyone
who will go nuclear of our small
scratches but I'm not even saying that
insulting way like this this will piss
people off example one of them right and
the thing about Apple devices they're
expensive
yeah very expensive enough that like a
lot of times they're show pieces so
scratch having scratches on it is like
that's right yeah I mean it's not a
shovel how easy do you think it would be
to imagine someone out there who's
iPhone cost more than their car yeah
like I probably know someone there you
go at one point in time I definitely
knew something and and the way people
would freak out about a scratch on a car
remember that okay I think as techies we
get really caught up in specs sometimes
yeah and how much RAM
iPhone has and how big the screen is and
whatever else and we lose track that for
the mainstream consumer it is a fairly
normal thing to spend a lot of money on
stuff for the sake of demonstrating to
the people around you that you could
have afforded to spend a lot of money on
something a case in point Yeezys okay I
didn't even I I didn't even hear about
Yeezys till like three months ago yeah I
had no idea they were a thing I had even
I'd even skimmed over the what's inside
Yeezys video that got them so much hate
and I was just like yeah okay not
interest like I just kind of went by it
I was like a lot of you think yeah
whatever and what I discovered is that
like my badminton group there's multiple
people there and now by Yeezys used like
they'll leak they'll be trolling the
used market for Yeezys buying them for
like four hundred dollars like keeping
them in like as good condition as they
bought them in and then selling them for
like a bit more like they're like
they're like turning a small profit on
their Yeezys so they can afford the easy
lifestyle and I'm trusting it what what
my shoes cost like a hundred dollars
have four places in each shoe in the
identical spot on each shoe where there
is very large significant trips head and
I'm not going to replace them that's not
going to happen how many times do you
think I've replaced my sandals since you
met me I think once and it was because
like they were in critical damage yeah
they came apart yes and want to hear
something really crazy I still have
those you think sit by the back yard so
I have huge to throw on when I go
outside the white runners that I had
when we first started working together
are I think in the front of this office
as like just in case Channel super fun
shoes nice yeah yeah see that is the way
to be alright speaking of dirty dirty
people that are going to jump into our
anyway sorry we never actually
talked about this oh so a Dutch Court
rules that Apple cannot supply
refurbished or remanufactured iPads as
warranty replacements it's also in the
chase what the bleep is a easy hahaha
you're the winner there you go um okay
so Apple refurbished products are ones
that have been sold and later returned
to the company they're returned to as
new standard and given the same warranty
as brand new devices and they are either
used for warranty replacements or made
available for sale - typical discount of
around 14 to 15 percent remanufactured
are newly manufactured but may include
used parts harvested from broken ones so
neither of them are considered okay now
there are multiple angles on this
there's a kind of an environmental
perspective I guess but personally I
don't really buy that you know Apple is
protecting the environment by giving
remanufactured devices offer more of
them at a 15% discount yeah a lot of it
is the the status symbol or maybe drop
your discount a little more yeah a 20%
if Apple was like look this is
remanufactured 50% off they wouldn't be
able to keep the mineral block it's not
a matter of like they're you know they
would have to manufacture more iPads and
destroy the earth it's just a matter of
them not wanting to do yeah um okay I
believe I do I respond yeah yeah so one
of the chat said just put a case on it
and like I agree spend 15% less and get
a case on it or buy it new have it break
not your fault and get a new one again
but you got to understand that not
everybody feels that way some people are
going to want to rock a naked red or
jet-black iPhone to show that they've
got the red one or the jet black one
people probably don't pose like this
with the jet black ones problem were
like probably businessí stuff yeah yeah
yeah yeah you got it
what would a Steel Panther or something
I don't know that is old-school Panther
it's from some movie where the guys like
a model and he has this like pose that
he strikes oh but then he just like a
whole bunch of different poses and calls
them all different things but they're
actually just the same thing I think
just like way that he looks at the
camera
fantastic all right so we would steal
someone's chance at their heels DSP oh

it's all good all right so now I've got
something pretty excited for pretty
excited I am pretty
excited no it's pretty exciting what how
do you want to hit another topic while I
try and find the the right chat for
these yes ah nope
what you got there I just don't know if
we're live dogs with that valve limits
teams gifting system without any warning
valve has been doing things that don't
make every single gamer on the planet
happy lately which is weird valve
announced that several changes to steams
gifting system will happen before users
on Steam could purchase a game as a gift
and store that copy in their inventory
for later use when sending games users
could either deliver the gift directly
through Steam or attach it to an email
through the client if you weren't
friends with the giftie in the service
with the changes you cannot store gifts
for future use so you just when
purchasing a game you already own you're
forced to choose a recipient of the gift
at the time when it will be delivered so
like immediately sending games through
email is now impossible and it is now
possible it is possible however to
schedule a game to be delivered months
in advance which is possibly how people
can like pre-order things I'm not
entirely sure or so you can like pick a
gift for someone yeah have it scheduled
and have it show up at the right time
it's pawn payment collectors have often
used steams gift inventory to store and
trade copies of delisted Steam titles
that's possibly why this is a thing
these changes will also affect users who
trade and self themed gifts on
third-party websites that's probably why
they're doing it
yeah gifts you have already stored will
not be affected so tell me something if
you were to buy a steam game for someone
else would that be an animated gift no I
made a gift I know yeah I'm sorry I
don't really have anything to contribute
to that I mean it sucks but I understand
why they're doing it yeah so there's not
really much to say it's just like more
hoops to jump through in order to give
something to someone sucks but I see why
they're doing it yeah okay is there like
is there a reason for so many of you
guys have been asking to meet the new
writers oh well um I
I guess I'm kicking you out for like
five minutes oh I didn't see you like
but that's only two of them yeah okay I
know it's fine so their probation
officially ends um tomorrow so I've
decided that you know while it might
seem a little cruel normally we don't
allow people on camera during their
probation because you know we don't want
you guys to get all attached to them and
then we end up kind of axing them so
while it might seem a little cruel to
finally let them meet you and seem as
though I am validating their futures
here as employees to only like acts in
the next day I'm gonna let them meet you
so I was gonna say like if they do bad
on the show you could still fire that's
true I still have I still have about 36
hours so uh who's first
yeah so well okay you don't have to be
one by one I guess
okay well then get get in here the
framing is only so wide though so you're
gonna have to kind of I'm gonna have to
cut an ear yeah I would need to do one
by one okay so this is James James is a
James is a young man with a whole dog's
a great future ahead of him
not at LMG why do you look like you're
so much taller than me I'm like : size
on this thing Oh cuz the chairs Luke
sighs anyway okay come on in here so
tell them about yourself who the hell
are you well I'm James I'm I'm the punny
guy here I guess I'm the one that makes
all the worst puns in all the videos
you're agreeing I think it's a mantle
that I kind of took from you so I wasn't
sure that you're going to hand that off
I'm totally cool with making you the pun
King not that I would ever not that I
would ever want you to feel like I'm
punking you Oh way to punch me below the
belt yeah yeah okay so basically James
has been responsible for such recent
projects as the LG 5k monitor
the nays are mic underwater mic the
underwater mic an upcoming RGB build
guide project that we're going to be
filming next week oh snap it's going to
be dang KS thought that was a surprise
um okay people shouldn't be surprised
yeah they should you be going right or a
while admit it yourself
yeah what else what else have you even
done is that it yes I've only had three
videos three assignments the entire time
how crabs in here okay well that's
awkward yeah so I did the air pause
video I did the you did not I do know
one of the air pods videos cheap air
pods alternatives I did the digital
storm gaming ultra-wide mm-hmm okay so
yeah thanks good job James so you'll see
James around more at least for the next
36 hours okay Anthony you're up next
sure
oh yeah if you guys have questions for
them fire up our them over to Luke James
isn't actually running away yet maybe
they'll all come in so Anthony I want to
talk about yourself who are you your
chess I am Anthony I come from
Newfoundland and I read about things so
this is the result of me giving them
like hard word count limits they end up
they end up losing track of how to
communicate in long form dang it man
okay so what have been some of your
favorite projects that you've worked on
uh as much of a pain as they were the
AMD releases okay we like the riser
release the rx 500 series really tight
deadlines on those but we got it out
thanks AMD yeah so much fun every time
an AMD project lands on my lap I just
know that I'm in for like the next
couple of like 24 or 48 hours it's just
going to be wonderful
yeah also responsible for the highly
controversial
Rison 5 simulation project not the
titling of it that was me but the actual
data
that ended up being extremely accurate
that was Anthony so there you go you'll
be seeing more of Anthony around now as
well maybe even on Channel super-fun
since these guys are are officially I
mean a few of them have appeared already
anyway but I kind of turned a blind eye
because I was pretty sure they were
going to make it but you'll see more of
Anthony soon and all right Alex you're
up cheetahs are fired ok ok can you
introduce yourself with your new sea
accent because it's awesome
I don't have any fee accent I'm not even
from there he's actually from there ok
whatever your eastern Canadian accents
all sounds the same to me like what do
you mean you did it on the phone during
your interview don't pretend you can't
do it I don't know I don't have to
prolong small like that oh come on I
don't know like really yeah yeah I don't
know what like it like why are you
talking about like okay so this is Alex
Alex what who are you um I don't know I
came from Nova Scotia slash Newfoundland
and oh my god Colton's coming down car
[Laughter]
take you LeBaron car I don't get it but
anyway uh what are they saying they want
to know if you race NASCAR but that
actually leads well into something that
you do do yeah I used to build dune
buggies and stuff and now I'm here I
guess I I wouldn't say I dropped out of
mechanical engineering but I stopped
going before I completed it and now I'm
making YouTube videos so you know oh
yeah go ahead no more unis including
some of our most controversial videos so
Alex has been responsible for a lot of
our system stuff including the latest
XPS 15 the msi trident they're super
tiny PC and the sketchy heatsink series
including the most recent effort with
the the casting and the and the 60% of a
workweek of like three employees that
got consumed by that by that video yeah
that um
I kind of knew how I was going to turn
out right from the start if I'm honest
oh well that's good honestly that's new
I know no one told me out I was going to
turn out so that's great well I don't
know like you said that you modeled this
off and talked here have you ever
watched when they try to do something
legit like would you have preferred that
we made something that was like half
terrible or all the way terrible I'm not
going to answer that question because
I'm afraid of what I'm going to end up
with in the future
Alex was also responsible for our most
controversial video other than the
Verizon simulation one in the last
little while few thousand dollar build
guide that went up the other night a lot
of people didn't like your part
selections there no comment so basically
what I'll say is this we knew that that
build wasn't perfect because right at
the time that we were like okay we need
to get build guides back on the rails
and we like got a thousand-dollar build
guide going AMD drops the news on us
that rise in five was like coming but it
was so far out that we already had some
stuff like coming in for the build guide
and so it was too far to stretch it out
and then working with these guys and
traveling so much has been really busy
we didn't get it shot until like by the
time we got it shot the 580 was not out
but was about to be announced to us we
didn't know it was coming yet and raiven
five probably was going to make more
sense but it was too late and the
selections for that were picked in like
January pretty much mono will be back it
was after you started so it's like March
like early March late February or
something like that so the reality of it
is could we have done better yes but I
also think that a lot of the hate was
undeserved we had one thousand dollar
budget build guide in the title that
meant one thousand dollar budget not one
thousand dollar budget build guide we
did remove the word budget because I can
see where the confusion came from but it
was a thousand
baller machine and it was $1000 based on
what we won't do next time but based on
regular pricing like not the cheapest
one we could find not taking advantage
of mail-in rebates and just like what
you could definitely build for $1000
yeah the no rebates thing actually adds
up fast
yeah well the other thing was that by
the time we were shooting it neither of
us was really in a position to go okay
we're going to do a build guide it's
going to have risin 5 this platform is
rock-solid but by the time it got edited
reisen has matured a lot yeah so that's
what happened there that's why he's not
fired
thank you Alex so Luke did you have any
questions that people compiled you guys
went on I'll kind of pile in here and
spend here literally nothing literally
no useful questions brilliant thank you
everyone a lot of people wanted to keep
Alex and then it came out that he was
responsible for the dollar bill cut and
then the tone shifted a little bit oh oh
ok but then after the explanation I
think it got a little bit better again
okay
all right good work all right thank you
guys cool
so you'll see him around as well all
right so yeah that's basically been what
I've been up to for the last six months
in addition to covering his ass because
he's been busy creating slow-playing
Club for a it is actually interested in
leaving Austin Rivers like half a year
yeah it's actually been an exhausting
four and a half years is what it's
really been yeah but yeah that's an
entirely separate thing all right what
else do we have
oh there was also by the way I should
mention there was also a lot of requests
for drop and break stuff girl Oh max max
is on vacation so I'm just permanent
vacation
Oh wrecked she doesn't know it yet
that's a little me know she was on
vacation she she had a pre booked thing
and she too even though she doesn't
technically have vacation time yet we
arranged her to be able to go on her
thing cool alright so the surface laptop
aimed at students weight I was last
week's news wasn't it hold on
I thought why is this the source for
wait what's going on here I thought this
was I thought this was rumors about oh
no the surface laptop oh yeah okay so
it's a thirteen and a half inch laptop
featuring the Microsoft 3x2 aspect ratio
the pixel since display it's got one USB
3 port mini DP Wow would have really
preferred to see that as a as a type-c
USB with wif DP it's got a headphone
jack though so that's a plus magnetic
power connector it's 2.76 pounds so it's
pretty darn light and it's got a
magnesium body with a fabric surface
palm rest area that's a terrible idea in
theory but I we will be getting one so I
will get my hands on one soon it's
available in several colors there's some
like sint fabrics that might do okay
yeah it but the way with the way that
like hand oils can burn away metal I'm
not holding up a lot of hope
yeah umm the OS is the new Windows 10 s
edition which stands for school and this
version of Windows that can only run
Windows Store apps so basically um enjoy
so school so that you don't get to learn
how to use a lot of really important
applications yeah windows s can be
converted to Windows 10 Pro however okay
alright the keyboard area is the same
felt material from the surface pro also
are horses you just feel good edge and
Bing will probably unless you go into
pro so specs you can get a core i5 or i7
u series processor up to 16 gigs of
lpddr3 up to 512 gigs of storage and it
boasts 14 and a half hours of battery
life starting at $9.99 ok dollars and
you have to use edge and bing so your
thoughts are not great
your thoughts are this is not much of a
Chromebook competitor yeah ok then do
you have any counter arguments I'm
really I okay so there's things that I
already hate about it like a laptop so
with the surface pro the thing about it
is that it's a tablet I don't expect the
keyboard to be used all the time I don't
expect it to experience the same kind of
wear that a laptop
so I accept the fabric on the keyboard
surface or this I'm not sure this
remains to be seen
so I at that price I don't personally
think that the Chromebook is is being
threatened in any significant way but no
store apps like not everyone that goes
to school only needs to use word like
there's some there's some things for
STEM fields that you might want to have
apps that probably aren't on the Windows
Store for so limiting school laptops to
only the Windows Store sounds like
limiting school laptops to making money
not living school laptops to school
there is one app that I download from
the Windows Store planks okay why not
the server yeah yeah just because that's
the plex client for Windows oh yeah you
can't just go download it not to my
knowledge maybe you can but I mean the
the Windows Store one like works like
Plex you should let people if you don't
already yeah but people just downloaded
right I could be wrong it's just that
I'm not one of it better definitely the
easiest one to find so I just I use it
and it works it works fine with that set
I've been having an issue with Plex
where you know I probably won't get into
that hey guys anyways oh this is good
this is rich posted by mr. meerkat on
the original articles from PC gamer
Intel Pels core i7 7700 K owners to stop
overclocking to avoid high temp it's
like they don't want to be popular yeah
so owners of Intel's Core i7 seventy
seven hundred and seventy seven hundred
K processors have been complaining for
the past three months of unusual
temperature increases of up ninety
degrees Celsius I'm assuming they mean
of up to ninety degrees Celsius and not
the temperature increase like the total
gap goes to ninety degrees Celsius and
also that's pretty close to the maximum
threshold of a hundred degrees and you
don't really want your processor to run
at ninety all the time so basically
Intel's response we don't recommend
running outside the processor
specifications like exceeding frequency
or voltage specifications or removing of
the integrated heat spreader
I mean it's frustrating because like
intel creates this problem for
themselves by marketing a que unlocked
in overclockable cpu and then putting in
sufficient Tim on it so I don't really
feel that bad for them not really a
different problem solve either yeah well
it might be difficult but for reasons we
might not necessarily understand like it
it may be difficult to solder that for
some reason I don't really know if I I
said may really really really strong
emphasis on me yeah well we can't say
not a it's not difficult it might be
something difficult about it oh this is
interesting
Ultra HD blu-ray disk encryption has
been cracked sword so the original
poster on the foremost Herodias and it
seems to have come from this reddit
thread so Smurfs 2 is apparently the
first cracked 4k blu-ray disc and you
might be able to get it somewhere I'm
not going to spend too much time on the
art pantry you guys I accomplished by
cracking the encryption on the drive
itself and not through like stripping
HDCP with capture method which is
actually pretty intense Wow yeah that's
crazy
yeah so that means you would need a
specialized to drive and yeah like it
milk it also means that you could do it
to all of them though okay so hit me
with this piracy groups they care about
they care about like putting their name
on like a release so and like taking
credit for it why like is that there's
no commercial benefit to that right it's
rip its rap yeah ah like we did this
yeah so they wouldn't so so okay so
let's say I think hypothetical piracy
group creates a master drive that can
read and and and rip any blu-ray so do
they actually go spend their money to go
buy blu-rays to rip them and release
them
like rep and do they not share their
their encryption braking method so other
people can load it on their Drive so
they can have all the rep it sort of
depends which group I would assume
because some groups might be like
open-source bumpers where they think
that there shouldn't be any encryption
or anything
uh-huh and they want everything to be
open you know in that sense they would
open up how they broke the drive share
and then also use the drives to break a
whole bunch of stuff uh-huh or they're
just like yar har pirates and they're
like we want to be known as the best
freakin pirates ever cool okay got it
I'm assuming yes these things okay let's
talk about the sort of the starcraft
source code so this was originally
hosted by a res Coughlin akov on the
forum and this article on Mashable gets
a couple of things right so they've got
that there was someone they've got that
something was found they've got what it
was the original Starcraft source code
and they've got right that Blizzard was
involved you know there was definitely a
shower that occurred but it was not
gifts nope so this is actually insane so
back in 2000 a disc containing the
starcraft source code was stolen from
Blizzard forcing them to start from
scratch a month ago a random Reddit user
Kemp chemist key mice bought a bunch of
Blizzard crap on eBay including a disc
labeled Starcraft gold master source
code Kenneth
handed it to Blizzard and received hit
me with this and I'm gonna okay I'm
gonna look I'm gonna start as excited as
I would be about what kind of reward I
might get this is like are you taking it
out of the box essentially right any
hands off you
doesn't he handing it to you like well
no you're receiving it no no your
Blizzard you're getting you're giving
stuff to me oh you're giving me the
thing I'm giving your thing I'm like
okay I am okay I'm like I'll give you
the box back you start opening it at the
very top it's a copy of overwatch then
there's some overwatch and Diablo swag
then there's 250 dollars in blizzards
store credit then there's a free trip to
Blizzcon and then there's the bottom of
the box and the box is like thin and not
very nice and it's just general gray
cardboard it's not like a cool one-off
branded box okay so here's the thing the
diskless stolen-property yes it is the
property of blizzard and chemists had no
business no right keeping it yep but
what the disc also was was for someone
who let's say for example was enough of
a blizzard nerd to be buying Blizzard
paraphernalia on eBay it was an utterly
unique item oh yeah it was illumise an
incredibly cool piece of Blizzard
paraphernalia that would have had aside
from the monetary value incredible
sentimental value
sentimental value that goes way beyond
what would you even buy with two hundred
and fifty dollars of Blizzard store
credit some skin skins get real okay
maybe some months of Wow some overwatch
in Diablo swag
you couldn't even scrounge up some
Starcraft swag and a trip to Blizzcon
which is like okay but what he or she
should have gotten is something utterly
unique something retro something that
goes way back to like that weird game
Blizzard made where you like shoot
chickens or something
or like do you know about that game I
don't think so that's when I probably
heard the name when I saw a Blizzard
logo on it when I was like it's like
ancient yeah I was like well I used to
like one of the really old games lost
Vikings anyway a great game what he
should have gotten they shouldn't have
even given him money because I go or her
that's not what this was about they're
buying this type of stuff that's
probably not a huge concern it should
have been a frickin life-sized gold
and okay like a statue and like a tour
yeah their facilities it should have
been way cooler blizzard you done goofed
on this one he's a huge Starcraft fan if
they have any like game designer some
Starcraft like have them meet up with
him at Blizzard care cuz the thing that
local say about these game companies is
they have this crap they build this crap
all the time for cons and stuff like I
guarantee you there's a life-sized
Kerrigan somewhere yep somewhere is go
in blizzards office there's a life-sized
Kerrigan or failing that a Hydralisk or
something oh well I'm going to the chat
is like they should have released wild
legacy servers for his efforts that
would have been pretty cool yeah I cared
that would have been unrelated though
yeah so um there you go where disappoint
but maybe you guys disagree I don't I
don't think that's even remotely fair
like looking at just pure monetary value
of what he got if he just flipped it on
eBay okay sorry I'm just I'm cringing so
hard at the switch comment I have to I
have to I'll get into I'll get into it
later go ahead go ahead
yes the only place code and has ever
existed but uh you'd like just pure
monetary value of the stuff that he got
is worth way less than if he just
reflect it on eBay
yeah which is like again again again he
should have given it back it was a
stolen item but like what Blizzard just
should have recognized the appropriate
response to this yeah and of this is
terrible uh so Pierre ownage who must be
like old-school internet enough to know
what Purim is unless you just don't and
you just like read it somewhere or just
Roberts - plays Wow he knows about
Gul'dan ball dancing warcraft orcs and
humans yeah well Ben's like og Warcraft
gold bands like a pre big deal I mean
the lore has changed somewhat like gold
Ann's role in everything and like and
like the funny thing is that's great
about older movie was weird for that
yeah so if you guys remember I never
watched it I go yeah
I heard the thing that's weird about old
old games and Warcraft was a great
example of this where every unit on both
sides orcs and humans was equivalent so
a grunt was exactly identical to a
footman or I don't even know if they
were called footman in Warcraft orcs and
humans but whatever the spearmen was
exactly identical to the spear thrower
or were they Archer whatever it's not
the point the point is the campaign's
were identical so even though the lore
was that the orcs like kick their butts
if you play the human campaign I don't
just met have even died like I don't
remember but there's like there's like
events that are just not right because
the missions are identical yeah down
both paths so I think on the orc side
you like dull bands gone crazy and you
have to go kill him and on the human
side yeah Madame does die on the human
side that it goes crazy and you have to
kill him it's just like totally
equivalent stuff but yes no I know
people in or some humans they didn't
read anything out yet you had to get to
read the text right there wasn't voice
acting um oh yes all voice acting yeah
yeah okay so he's saying Medivh wrong
because of that I don't know he doesn't
play well oh yeah then that first is
your point
yeah I only I only know who thank-you
Medivh is from Warcraft dorks until you
read it and it looks like motive yeah
sorry
alright there was a couple comments no
read it says yesterday I got another
call they invited me to Blizzcon
all-expense-paid dinner and drinks with
the staff okay so that's okay I still
would have wanted to uni so they
probably did that because everyone was
like what or maybe they planned it let's
give benefit of the doubt but they still
should give him a life-size Carrigan I'm
not going to be happy till he has a
life-size Carrigan you should be able to
like pick yeah pretty much whatever
character yeah
life-sized any character yeah alright
that's great I love this okay ah Matt
whatever Oh King Oh for you're
officially my favorite how young is
Linus that is the way to ask that
question
and I'm 30 years young Thank You old and
it's a weird way of saying that I know
it's such an insecure like yeah halfway
as some institutions you say old when
your who's your daddy yeah
just at
that mentioned something that I plan
yeah one of my buddies was like opening
up a badminton Center when when we moved
in here and decided we didn't want the
couch
there he needed a couch and funny story
he happened to have bought one of that
exact couch oh wow and was going to go
back and get another one when I was like
yo do you need a couch someone that's
pretty fantastic sometimes life is funny</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
