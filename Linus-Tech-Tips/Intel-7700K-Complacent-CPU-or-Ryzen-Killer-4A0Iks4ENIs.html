right now is centered around AMD's
upcoming rise in release Intel has no
plans to take that line down and has
just unveiled their seventh generation
Core processors for desktop codename KB
Lake
EVGA SDG 87 full tower case features
optimized airflow pathing to help keep
your Hardware cool check it out at the
link in the video description they
claimed to be taking computing to the
next level but I'm pretty sure marketing
guys would just get fired if they don't
say that kind of stuff only performance
will tell whether a shiny new KB Lake
will be worth 350 of your hard-earned
dollars we'll be looking at Intel's
newest consumer grade flagship the core
i7 7700 K and if you think that just
means the usual features you know
quad-core hyper-threading and
overclocked ability on zed series
chipsets well Sarah you'd be 100%
correct out of the box there's a bump on
the clock speed compared to its sky like
predecessor the 6700 K and you also get
Intel HD graphics 630 as opposed to 530
though if you spend this kind of money
on a high-end i7 you're probably using
discrete graphics from the likes of
Nvidia or AMD anyways so to find the
differences we clearly need to dig a bit
deeper there doesn't seem to be much
else on paper to separate these chips
they have the same TDP of 91 watts the
same 16 PCIe lanes and even the same
manufacturing process the old tic-tock
cadence meant a new process so smaller
processors every two years but KB Lake
is still using the same 14 nanometer
FinFET transistors we've had since
Broadwell in 2014 so at this point I
wouldn't blame you for not being mega
super excited about the 7700 K itself
but that doesn't mean there isn't
anything worth talking about with
respect to the platform one thing that
will be immediately relevant to a lot of
folks that own a 4k display will be the
ability to watch Netflix in 4k this is
thanks to a new DRM scheme that I'm sure
consumers will just love because it has
nothing to do with processing power at
all and everything to do with a special
hardware based decoder
that can only be found in KB Lake CPUs
at this time on the subject of 4k
content you also get 4k 10-bit video
decoding through the vp9 codec used by
YouTube so if you have a monitor with
10-bit color and a supported video card
you can get smoother color transitions
when watching supported content very
cool perhaps more interesting than that
is support for often which is Intel's
version of 3d crosspoint a new type of
memory with cells that are packed more
densely meaning higher capacities and
faster speeds that is expected to
perform somewhere between system RAM and
an SSD pretty freakin cool but kind of
like SATA Express back in the day
there's no word on if and when we'll see
it on consumer pcs but hopefully we'll
get this one there are also new chipsets
we tested our CPU on an asus rog Maximus
9 code featuring these Eddy 270 chipset
which adds native support for USB 3.1 10
gigabit and an additional 4 PCI Express
3.0 lanes which is actually a welcome
change considering how popular
pcie-based storage is becoming in the
form of tiny and increasingly affordable
m2 drives some other fun features of
this board specifically include a water
flow sensor a USB 3.1 10 gigabit front
panel header aura and/or a sink to add
some RGB to your case reinforced PCI
Express slots for heavy GPUs and a
built-in headphone amplifier but enough
chitchat
did this 7700 K Zed 271 2 punch impress
us with its performance gains we
compared it to a skylake 6700 K both at
stock and at overclocked speeds using a
Seuss's AI tuner automatic overclock and
setting temperature and voltage targets
to 80 degrees and 1.35 volts to keep
things safe which gave us 4.9 gigahertz
on KB Lake and 4.6 on skylake let us
know in the comments if you'd like a
full OC guide including manual tuning in
future let's start with thermals and
power draw temperatures were quite
similar though KB Lakes showed a slight
improvement at load though both chips
were comfortably below their thermal
throttling point in I to 64 KB lake
similarly showed a small improvement in
power draw nothing dramatic and it won't
affect your system build planning since
it's easy to run an enthusiast single
graphics card system on an inexpensive
450 to 500 watt power supply anyways now
let's dive into performance numbers our
synthetics which included CPU mark y
cruncher Cinebench and ROG reel bench
showed KB Lake offering improvements of
about 5 to 7 percent across the board
including in single threaded
applications which isn't terrible but
isn't horribly impressive either and
when you compare kb lake at stock versus
our overclocked skylake chip which ran
within 100 megahertz of each other the
gap becomes smaller making these
improvements an even more minor selling
point for enthusiasts who well overclock
gaming performance wasn't much different
as there was no appreciable difference
between generations when gaming with a
discrete GTX 1080
with kb lake actually performing
slightly worse in some situations for
onboard video aficionados the integrated
HD 630 graphics do show a small
improvement over sky lake but the 1 to 2
extra frames per second don't really
make it viable for new triple-a titles
bringing us to the conclusion these
small improvements don't make kb lake a
bad platform if you liked last year's
madden game you'll probably like the new
one with all the updated player stats
and special team jerseys - they just
mean that kb lake isn't really a
sensible upgrade for a core i7 machine
built in the last 1 2 3 years something
that could be a product of the
challenges associated with building
faster chips on current technology or
could be a product of a complacent Intel
that hasn't really had a real competitor
in almost a decade I'm sure the next
couple of years will tell us once and
for all which one it is
so Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app
that makes it easy to browse privately
and enjoy a more open Internet you
simply download it it's so easy you just
go to the page and like downloads
automatically it's actually kind of
amazing then what happens is you press
the button and you can pick up to 20
different countries to tunnel through
and as soon as you activate that button
boom your connection gets encrypted and
it appears to the websites and services
you use online as though you are
browsing from a different country the
best part is you don't have to take my
word for it you could try it for free
with 500 Meg's of data and no credit
card required heading over to tunnel
bear comm /l TT and using our link you
can save 10% if you get an unlimited
data plan all right guys if you like
this video like it if you just like this
video dislike it get subscribe to see
more of our content I'm sure there's
gonna be a crazy insane fanboy war down
below so try to keep it as simple as
possible and if you'd like to take it
away from the YouTube comments you can
go to the forum I'm still I'm sure
that's going to be a war still but try
to keep it civil there as well if you
want to check out some of our merch you
can see that and link down below also
there's a link to Amazon where you can
buy whatever processor your heart
desires
and if you want to see another video
check out this one which is actually not
a line of seconds video this is a
channel super fun video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
