is not a retail product so like there's
no proper packaging inside but I cannot
emphasize enough that if you buy a
d-link router it will not come with no
packaging inside inside the box but I
want to talk about the dhp 1320 and what
is special about this particular router
this uses a qualcomm chipset that allows
not only wired and wireless operation
but also power line operation built
right into the router using the and I
can never remember this number the one
905 point one standard so what that
means is that just by installing this
router in your home you have the
flexibility to use either a wired
connection to say the computers that are
in the same room or that you can easily
run a wire to wireless to your mobile
devices and then power line to things
like televisions in the future that
adopt this standard things like just
regular powerline adapters even from
other brands right now interoperability
between brands is something that
powerline doesn't really doesn't really
feature so that's something that we're
going to have do to do to this new
standard and so let's let's talk about
the router a little bit here so this is
okay sorry
the dhp 1320 and it's got a little note
here a dhp 306 a V or W 306 AV adapter
is required to create a powerline
network but the one that I'm gonna be
demoing when I do my NCIX tech tips is
going to be from a completely different
brand just to emphasize that as long as
the device complies to this standard it
is going to work so okay do you like
green power think green it's designed to
conserve energy all that good stuff so
that's kind of neat so power saving by
link status power saving by cable link
so it doesn't use more power to transmit
a signal than it has two power saving by
Wireless LAN scheduling in an on/off
button that you can use to turn it off
when it's not in use whole home coverage
with no unsightly cables yes
I if you guys have watched my videos a
fair bit you
that I'm a huge advocate of power line I
love power line and what this does is it
actually makes it even better so a
convenience of Wi-Fi so this is Wi-Fi n
300 router and then on the back ok you
know what let's just start looking at it
here we go
this is the router itself and I
apologize for beating beat up this is
like an eval sample that sort of made
the rounds before it's before it's
gotten to me for me to have a look at
and see if I'm as impressed once I
actually try it as I am when I hear
about the initial technology so you guys
will have to subscribe to my MCI XCOM
channel if you want to see that video
we're actually gonna try it out
I can tell you now it's pretty heavy for
a router we got some ventilation holes
on the front remember powerline adapters
often get quite warm and that's one of
the reasons they're often positioned
away from the wall so I can see why yeah
you've got vent holes on the bottom vent
holes on the side vent holes on the
front because all of that power line
technology is now in here as well as a
router a switch and a wireless access
point so there's a whole lot of
technology going on in here we have a
WPS button as well as yeah there's no
manual so I'm gonna have to rely on
someone to post a comment and tell me
what that one does on the back we have
three LAN ports a LAN port so instead of
having a five port switch this has a
four port switch built into it we can
actually put it in AP mode or router
mode that is a very handy little button
to have and that's one of the cool
things about this particular standard is
that it also allows you to use devices
whether they're little powerline access
points or whether they're wireless
extenders very very easily with a very
minimal setup so that's what's gonna
allow you if one device is not enough to
cover your home you can actually set up
repeaters in order to make sure that
with a couple of devices you can get
full coverage so I guess that's one of
the reasons they might want you to be
able to put this in access point mode so
you can just buy another one plug it in
to an existing powerline connection or
rather right here for pyrite powerline
and then use it as an AP we've got a
reset switch USB for storage the on/off
switch is right there an AC in so the AC
in check this out and at a router that
doesn't use
power brick that's one of the other
reasons is heavy because it has an
internal power supply because that power
supply is not only powering the device
but also acting as a powerline network
so if you don't understand how powerline
network works it uses the cables in your
walls the wires and your walls to
transmit data as well as electricity
rather than using an Ethernet cable as
something far away it can actually go
through your circuit breaker and access
your entire house I've even used it in a
warehouse before that was a few thousand
square feet away from where I had my my
actual router and one powerline adapter
and then I used a notebook way way way
far away and it still works just fine so
that's the key difference here instead
of needing an Ethernet cable to a
powerline adapter to an extension cable
to the wall now your router has already
made your entire home network powerline
ready just by plugging it in so thank
you for checking out my little video
about I guess it was sort of about the
dhp 1320 but what it's really about is
the I forget the number again the 1905
point one standard which is going to
allow us to more easily network our
homes using powerline</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
