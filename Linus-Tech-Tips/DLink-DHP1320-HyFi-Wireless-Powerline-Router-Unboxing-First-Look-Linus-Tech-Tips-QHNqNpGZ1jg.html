is not a retail product so like there's
no proper packaging inside but I cannot
emphasize enough that if you buy a
d-link router will not come with no
packaging inside inside the box but I
want to talk about the dhp 1320 and what
is special about this particular router
this uses a Qualcomm chipset that allows
not only wired and wireless operation
but also powerline operation built right
into the router using the and I can
never remember this number the 190 5.1
standard so what that means is that just
by installing this router in your home
you have the flexibility to use either a
wired connection to say the computers
that are in the same room or that you
can easily run a wire to wireless to
your mobile devices and then power line
to things like televisions in the future
that adopt this standard things like
just regular powerline adapters even
from other brands right now
interoperability between brands is
something that power line doesn't really
doesn't really feature so that's
something that we're going to have due
to due to this new standard and so let's
let's talk about the router a little bit
here so this is okay sorry the dhp 1320
and it's got a little note here a dhp
306 AV or w 306 AV adapter is required
to create a powerline network but the
one that I'm going to be demoing when I
do my NCIX tech tips is going to be from
a completely different brand just to
emphasize that as long as the device
complies to this standard it is going to
work so okay do you like green power
think green is designed to conserve
energy all that good stuff so that's
kind of neat so power saving my link
status power saving by cable length so
it doesn't use more power to transmit a
signal then it has to power saving by
wireless LAN scheduling in an on-off
button that you can use to turn it off
when it's not in use whole home coverage
with no unsightly cables yes I if you
guys have watched my videos a fair bit
you
know that I'm a huge advocate of
powerline I love power line and what
this does is it actually makes it even
better so the convenience of Wi-Fi so
this is Wi-Fi n 300 router and then on
the back of you know what let's just
start looking at it here we go this is
the router itself and i apologize for
beating beat up this is like an eval
sample that sort of made the rounds
before it's before it's gotten to me for
me to have a look at and see if I'm as
impressed once I actually try it as I am
when I hear about the initial technology
so you guys will have to subscribe to my
NCIX comm channel if you want to see
that video we're actually going to try
it out I can tell you now it's pretty
heavy for a router we got some
ventilation holes on the front remember
powerline adapters often get quite warm
and that's one of the reasons they're
often positioned away from the wall so I
can see why yeah you've got vent holes
on the bottom vent holes on the side
vent holes on the front because all of
that power line technology is now in
here as well as a router a switch and a
wireless access point so there's a whole
lot of technology going on in here we
have a WPS button as well as yeah
there's no manual so I'm going to have
to rely on someone to post a comment and
tell me what that one does on the back
we have three lan ports a lan port so
instead of having a five ports which
this has a 4-port switch built into it
we can actually put it in AP mode or
router mode that is a very handy little
button to have and that's one of the
cool things about this particular
standard is that it also allows you to
use devices whether they're little power
line access points or whether they're
Wireless extenders very very easily with
very minimal setup so that's what's
going to allow you if one device is not
enough to cover your home you can
actually set up repeaters in order to
make sure that with a couple of devices
you can get full coverage so I guess
that's one of the reasons they might
want you to be able to put this in
access point mode so you can just buy
another one plug it in to an existing
power line connection or rather right
here for a power line and then use it as
an AP we've got a reset switch USB for
storage the on/off switch is right there
and AC in so the AC in check this out
and at a router that doesn't use a power
brick that's one of the other reasons is
had
because it has an internal power supply
because that power supply is not only
powering the device but also acting as a
powerline network so if you don't
understand how powerline network works
it uses the cables in your walls the
wires and your walls to transmit data as
well as electricity rather than using an
Ethernet cable if something's far away
it can actually go through your circuit
breaker and access your entire house
I've even used it in a warehouse before
that was a few thousand square feet away
from where i had my my actual router and
one powerline adapter and then I used a
notebook way way way far away and it
still works just fine so that's the key
difference here instead of meeting an
ethernet cable to a powerline adapter to
an extension cable to the wall now your
router has already made your entire home
network powerline ready just by plugging
it in so thank you for checking out my
little video about I guess it was sort
of about the dhp 1320 but what it's
really about is the EFC Africa the
number again the nineteen oh five point
one standard which is going to allow us
to more easily Network our homes using
power line</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
