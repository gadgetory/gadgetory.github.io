on some of the ball and new server gear
that we've had arriving for the new
office including a powerful Xeon based
storage server the plans for which I've
actually already kind of revised and our
new 2,000 dollar 12 port 10 game at
network switch but today we're going to
kick things up a notch with a
custom-built story nadir mass storage
server from 45 drives comm that features
over 100 terabytes of high-speed storage
so strap in guys cuz this couldn't be
good
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilizing
the nvme standard provides speeds never
before seen on consumer storage drives
click my hair to learn more so the
problem we're trying to overcome here
seem straightforward on the surface how
to store all our data but when you go
out in the real world and see entire
video production houses running off of
USB and thunderbolt external drives or
coming up with long term archival
solutions like write the dates on the
sides of the drives and put them on a
shelf in the bathroom completely exposed
to dust moisture and accidents as if
this was the VHS home video dark ages it
suggests that we've been asking maybe
the wrong questions all this time
because it's not about storage it's
about accessibility the number of times
that we've gone to do our review of some
exciting new next-gen products and gone
hey maybe I'll grab some full quality
footage of its predecessor from our old
video for comparison which oh it's on
the archive shelve isn't it guess I'll
do what we always do and download the
old video from YouTube then slice it up
in crappy quality that happens more than
I'd like to say and obviously that's not
a solution that makes sense as Linus
media group continues to scale the
amount and quality of footage that we're
storing as well as the number of people
who need to access it as our company
grows so let's talk store inator s45 the
middle-of-the-road model that we chose
that sits in between the more quiet SMB
optimized 30 drive version and the
monster XL 60 drive version in the front
you'll find three 120-millimeter cooling
fans to push air through our drives with
a custom linus media group logo painted
onto the graphite powder coated chassis
on top then behind that three rows of 15
slots that give us the 45 drive capacity
for this sucker further toward the back
we find another two 120 millimeter fans
that will pull air through the drives
and then
the system hardware chamber that exists
only to power the other two-thirds of
the case overall it strikes an unusual
balance between being objectively
professional-grade with all the core
components and Intel 2.1 gigahertz six
core Xeon CPU 128 gigs of kingston ECC
ddr3 ram a Super Micro motherboard a two
plus one fully redundant 700 watt power
supply 316 port SAS controller cards
from LSI and an Intel X 540 10 gigabit
network card are from brands with
reliability reputations ranging from
excellent to legendary and yet it has a
small custom system builder or DIY feel
to it but comes from things like the
blue LED lit vandal switch at the back
that's used to power the unit on the
flat cable managed but obviously off the
shelf molex splitters that provide power
to up to 45 drives at a time the fairly
rudimentary PC builder tool on their
site and the general simplicity of the
enclosure design that other than the
fixed backplane something that I really
prefer compared to just loose cables as
a smaller operator who's going to tinker
with these machines versus chucking one
of the hundreds of them in my data
center out if there's some kind of an
issue it looks like something that could
be made in a pretty normal fabrication
shop what a cool machine but of course
that's not what you guys are here to see
the store inator isn't the star of the
show today it's more of an enabler so
after installing FreeNAS a freebsd based
storage operating system with native ZFS
support that you can learn more about
here it was finally time to break out
the hard drives now while Seagate
sounded like I punched them in the gut
when I told them that I needed 27 drives
for this project they also understood
that if you're actually serious about
having fast reliable network access to
your 4k footage for a number of
operators at a time you need a lot of
drives and they have to be high
performance so many drives in fact that
they won't even fit in one master carton
shipping box so once we'd figured out
how many 27 the next step was to
determine which model of drive we would
be using honestly for most people and
small businesses for that matter nothing
more hardcore than ainaz hard drive
would be required they're rated for 24/7
operation they offer reasonable if not
earth shattering performance certainly
more than a gigabit network connection
would require they go up to four
terabytes that gives you 24 terabytes of
storage with a couple of disks
redundancy and they can be obtained for
under $40 u.s. per terabyte they're kind
of like the city boss of hard drives but
this is lie this tech tip suckas so i'ma
ride around in a 747 instead sorry
anyway because we have more than just
hand cam vlog footage to deal with these
days sometimes even sponsored projects
for customers where data loss is not an
option we opted for Seagate's enterprise
capacity drives unlike their Nass or
even enterprise nas drives which are
rated for the adverse conditions and the
vibration associated with up to eight or
sixteen bay drive enclosures
respectively the enterprise capacity
drives feature exotic interfaces up to
twelve gigabit per second SAS big
capacities up to six terabytes per drive
top of the line performance 10 times the
workload rating of their desktop drive
counterparts at five hundred and fifty
terabytes per year and they do all of
this while managing external vibrations
so you can pack them in as tight as you
can pack them pretty much which I guess
means it's time to start talking about
how that went so to start things off I
went with nine drives in a ZFS two
configuration this gives me just shy of
80% storage efficiency with two of my
drives dedicated to redundancy I used
one of my two SSD raid array clients
here that are both on the same 10
gigabit network and achieved read and
write speeds in the 300 plus megabyte
per second range not too shabby
but I mean I wasn't really sure what to
expect at this point expanding as the FS
storage server is both simple and kind
of complicated as long as you have the
same number of the same capacity of
drives it's extremely fast and basically
a few button presses
to get her up and running but don't get
your hopes up about simply adding a
tenth drive to an existing nine drive
array like you can do with a hardware
RAID card it just doesn't work that way
unfortunately the good news is that
adding another set of drives should
yield a significant improvement in
performance since it's effectively
striping data across the two sets
unfortunately that wasn't my experience
I saw the same numbers as before
so after soldiering on and adding my
third set of nine drives for a total of
twenty seven and over 100 terabytes of
storage and then realizing that the
performance needle still hadn't budged I
figured it was time to throw another
client at the problem
so with two clients to SSD based gigabit
clients excuse me ten gigabit clients
copying 20 gigabytes of data
concurrently speeds were effectively
doubled I got perfect scaling indicating
that both drive speed and the speed of
the network card in our store inator are
not bottlenecks but unfortunately I
don't have anymore 10 gigabit clients at
the moment so this victory and discovery
also means that we're done for the time
being until we move into the new office
where I can give it to aggregated
network connections for 20 gigabit per
second total for your reticle speeds and
then hammer this thing with half a dozen
clients at the same time to find out
exactly where her limits are so stay
tuned for that
speaking of staying tuned audible.com
keeps you tuned in to the books that you
want to sit down to read but simply
don't have the time for by letting you
take your library with you on the go you
can listen in the car at work on the bus
in bed or anywhere that you can wear a
pair of headphones really with over
150,000 audiobooks to choose from so
there's definitely going to be something
for you especially if you're into having
your favorite celebrities read to you
Dustin Hoffman's performance of being
there by Jerzy Kosinski is getting rave
reviews for his performance so you might
want to check it out and join the book
club now to get an audiobook every month
at audible.com slash Linus and if you're
on the fence about audible.com
anyway the first one is actually free
all right guys that's pretty much it
