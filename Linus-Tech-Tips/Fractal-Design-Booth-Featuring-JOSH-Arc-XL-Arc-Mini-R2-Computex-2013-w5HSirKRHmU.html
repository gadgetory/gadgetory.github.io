powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM so fractals booth is has this
augmented reality type of concept going
on here so I'm holding what appears to
be some kind of tablet like device Johan
tell me how this works want to come
closer to the end users and end-user
customers you know want to see our
product so the first thing is like a
standard mobile app where you can
actually see product pictures product
sheets and stuff like that but we also
added this augmented reality face I
think you have to hold it really still
like there which means I have a trigger
image here and when I move my and my
tablet or my phone with Android or iOS I
can actually in real time see the
product and make them rotate and zoom in
and zoom out here I change in our new
archaic sol model and it makes it a
little bit more fun to actually go
through our product range very cool so
we're going to go through these products
do you have any of these here in person
definitely step in and we can take you
quickly here we go welcome to the
fractal design booth where everyone's
best friend josh is a pretending that
he's tall again it's all a trick of
course it's a trick of the camera it's
just a total dude
alright so speaking of checking things
out the first thing we have right here
is the arc Sol can you tell me about the
arc Sol well there's a space so it'd be
the arc XL yeah you want little bit
closer I got confused because uh you
know when you said that you were
developing a new product you were there
was some kind of potty language so I
assumed you were developing like the
arsal and so I thought maybe you changed
the name slightly and that's why we
ended up with this but but this is
actually another edition of the arc
exactly so it's basically the Big
Brother to the arc MIDI r2 what you're
looking at is a full tower case as
compared to a mid tower case in the our
committee
all the features 11 the arc MIDI r2 are
available here as well as redesigned SSD
mounts in the back ok so basically guys
it's taller which is not necessarily
always better and doesn't really
indicate anything else about its
physique it has hard drive cages down
here that are removable in addition to
for three and a half inch or two and a
half inch cages that go right about here
so you don't have to compromise all of
your hard drive expandability if you
want to put in a nice thick radiator
just like that full support for a triple
radiator up here on the top you can see
there's no interference with the
motherboard itself so you don't have to
worry about the size of the vrm heat
sinks or the size of your RAM heat sinks
or anything along those lines it has
nine expansion slots means you can do
pretty much whatever you want in terms
of motherboard size again though size is
not always the thing that is most
important about this stuff but let's go
ahead and have Josh tell us about a more
sensibly size case Josh can you even
reach this case from all the way up
there yeah well this is our Linus model
as compared to the Josh model back there
so what we're looking at is the arc mini
art - it's a mini tower case and what
you have right here is a full custom
customization basically we have a real
fat 360 millimeter radiator in the top
if you notice that is almost as long as
the case itself we can also support fat
radiators in the front both drive cages
are removable as well as the optical
drive cage is being removable in this
one so if you want to have an optical
drive you can if you want to go high
rads you can do that as well and if you
go around to the back you can check out
our new SSD mounting system so come on
back here so the new SSD mounting system
does not require the motherboard to be
removed from the case because all you
have to do is undo these screws and then
you can pop the whole thing off and then
you can mount the SSDs or unmount them
to the case just the way you want to and
check this out enough room for cable
management that is a 24 pin cable right
there bundled with a whole bunch of
other stuff and this side panel by my
estimation looks like it does indeed
close so what this really indicates to
me is that the arc mini r2 is more like
the the functional model that doesn't
really feel like it's compensating for
anything by sort of you know going over
the top and you know just doing things
for the sake of you know not necessarily
the experience
of using this device so to speak but
more to do with the functionality so
here I don't know if you ever got a good
view of that but that radiator on there
is about this thick okay so that is a
push configuration right now now one
thing you got to watch out for guys is
if you go crazy on this you're gonna
make you want to make sure you have
compatibility with low profile dims as
well as a motherboard that doesn't have
like massive heat sinks coming out the
top but the reality of it is this is a
lot of computer in a very small case and
it can it can run every bit as fast as
the excel over there Thank You Josh oh
thank you you guys don't know what we're
thanking each other for yet
yeah we're just thanking each other for
being awesome you're taking me for being
awesome I'm thinking you for just being
here next to my awesomeness I'm bathing
in it basking and bathing I mean can you
do that at the same time it's called
multitasking yes excellent I'm not
moving the mic over to you to say stuff
like that you can't say stuff like that
look let's focus on the case man look
it's got a removable top it's got a fan
filter you didn't even tell me that
because you should have already known
that how am I supposed to know that you
didn't send me one of these no
everything come on you know everything I
think you're the last person in the
world to believe anything like that I
didn't say I believed it I just just
saying it I mean didn't you invent the
tree um I think we're done here
don't miss out are you still rolling oh
man don't miss any of our country tax
2013 coverage guys were powered by WD
here at the show this year we are also
powered by Corsair Vengeance gaming
peripherals and NCIX calm as always
don't forget to subscribe to Lions tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos hopefully yeah
we're way up there in terms of how full
of themselves they are oh it's very
compact in this one it's very dense
right here I'm not dense is that what
you're implying
I still have less gravity than you okay
I'll give you that I'll give you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
