if you're a speed freak added until 3500
series SSD to your Haswell system for a
truly enthusiast class experience
welcome to my unboxing and first look at
the tte Sports level 10 and gaming mouse
their tagline is born to be seen which
brings us to the level 10 concept so
this isn't the first level 10 product
from Thermaltake and it is as such not
the first product that they've built in
collaboration with BMW design works USA
so what's what's level 10 a.m. according
to their website mmm I'm just gonna read
this experience high-end computers
through the design itself combined
iconic design with optimum functionality
and innovative details with these
products quality is of the utmost
importance so you're not going to find
any skimping on the workmanship or the
materials here and it's a little bit
different from the inspired by pro
gamers approach where for something like
a Saphira which was designed in
collaboration with white rob a Starcraft
2 player whereas this is more like yeah
it has to have the functionality and the
ergonomics and the comfort but it also
has to look like something that anyone
who has you know a sense of style would
proudly display on their desk so this
attention to detail and quality carries
over in the specs first thing we find
about this most is it's got an 8200 dpi
laser sensor that's pretty much top of
the range as far as it goes today you've
also got fully programmable buttons that
can be switched between profiles with
the DPI and profile switcher buttons so
this is a multi way button one two three
four right there and you've got a B on
the left side left right and middle
click as well as C and D buttons on the
right side for a total of 11
programmable keys that you can
reconfigure in the software you've also
got dpi indicators up here on the top
right that light up when the mouse is
illuminated and it's available in three
different colors depending on your
personal preference diamond black iron
white and military green one of the
things about the mouse that I really
feel marries the functionality and
design aspects is the aluminum unibody
shell
so what this does is it adds rigidity to
the mouse so it's very very strong using
aluminum like this it's relatively
lightweight compared to other metals so
it goes all the way from the right side
to the bottom to the left and it's
corrosion resistant this is a property
of aluminum that might not be that
helpful on a mouse unless you're eating
corrosive snacks while you're gaming but
last and not least aluminum does help
with heat dissipation so the fact that
you're going to be making contact with
the mouse on the right and left side
could help to cool your hand a little
bit although I don't think this can make
a huge difference and that combined with
again another design aesthetic of the
mouse right here the ventilation holes
on the top
couldn't hurt in terms of making sure
that you don't over sweat yourself and
you know find your hand slipping off the
mouse during a long gaming session
another functionality thing is the fact
that the mouse has what they're calling
3d adjustments so you get 15 degrees on
the back of the mouse with the included
tool kind of remove this here and having
a difficult time there you go so you can
adjust the backing up and down this is
15 degrees so it's all the way down now
now I'm going up so you can hopefully
see how that's being adjusted there or
maybe I'm going down there yeah I'm
going down now so this this backing
piece right here and then you can also
actually tilt the mouse left and right
five millimeters so I hope you're going
to be able to see this maybe we'll do an
overlay a close-up there so you can
hopefully see how the back actually
tilts so this allows your wrist to be a
little bit more aligned while you're
using it more design and aesthetic but
this should definitely appeal to the
gamers out there is the fact that it has
seven different lighting colors
available in four different zones I'm
going to go ahead and plug the mouse in
and we're going to see what we get by
default here so the dragon inside lights
up the mouse wheel itself lights up the
DPI selector lights up and then this
design element rectangle up here also
lights up meaning that you can see the
lighting effects of the mouse from any
angle where you're looking at it and you
can change them around to whatever is
going to suit your personal aesthetic so
you can see that the red version of the
mouse comes with red by default however
like I said you can use the software to
completely change that around if you
want now the last little bit of hardware
functionality is the AHA carrying case
that it comes with that includes two
separate pouches one
for the most someone for the cable so
more functionality built into it
wherever you happen to be taking your
mouse you don't want to scratch it
because it's not just functional it's
also stylish it's got to look good on
your desk as much as it has to be
functional so it's going to come down to
the individual do you want something
more pro-gamer inspired like a Saphira
where it's all about the ergonomics and
like the button placements and
everything is exactly perfectly exactly
there and that easel or do you want
something that is more about the well
the marriage of both functionality and
style and that I think is going to be
the level 10m gaming mouse from tte
sports now speaking of functionality and
style audible.com
you can head over to audible.com slash
Linus where you can get yourself a free
audiobook I actually just recently
picked up the Cat in the Hat by dr.
Seuss there's a number of other dr.
Seuss books that are also included and I
was inspired to do so because I was
driving the other day and I was
listening to the radio and I couldn't
insurance I'd come on and I was sure
that it was John Cleese and it turns out
that it was so I was like you know I
need more of his soothing British accent
in my life and so does my 1 year old
baby so I picked up this Cat in the Hat
thing and actually he's not the only
celebrity voice that is reading some of
dr. Seuss's awesome stories there's
Billy Crystal as well as Walter Matthau
and there's absolutely nothing bad news
bears about any of those voice actors so
guys head over to audible.com slash
Linus to get yourself a free audiobook
