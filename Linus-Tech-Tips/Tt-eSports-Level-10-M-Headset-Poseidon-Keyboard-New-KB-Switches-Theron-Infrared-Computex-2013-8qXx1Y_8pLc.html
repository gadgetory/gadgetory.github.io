powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM so we've got Eric here from tt
eSports who's gonna be showing us some
pretty cool stuff they've also got a lot
of stuff that they've already released
but why don't you start with this guy
right here this is the Poseidon and it's
a mechanical keyboard people love
mechanical keyboards is so big these
days tell me two things
why are mechanical keyboards such a big
deal all of a sudden and number two is
how does it house this position in the
market why do we need the Poseidon in
addition to all your other mechanical
keyboards okay so mainly people want
mechanical keyboards these days because
they're a lot more durable than membrane
keyboards have been in the past sorry so
it's really durable it costs a little
bit more but it's like guaranteed to
last like 50 million keystrokes usually
if it doesn't then you just return to
get a new one so it just like keeps that
lifetime cycle going so tell me about
the durability because these are a
lower-cost mechanical keyboard but you
can still you can still offer that
guarantee to your customers yeah so in
the past I've done videos on YouTube and
probably look for them I've I took a BMW
and rolled over our mecha g1 keyboard
just to prove like it's really durable
it still works there's videos on YouTube
but the market position for this
keyboard we decided to release something
that's a little more cost affordable in
the past our keyboards have been in like
the 129 139 range so we're trying to get
something a little bit more affordable
for every gamer so what we decided to do
is release a really simple entry-level
mechanical keyboard so we came up with
the Poseidon we have a non backlight and
a backlight version so the backlight
versions gonna be starting at $89.99 and
the non bacala it's gonna be $79.99 but
at the same time even though it's cost
affordable we didn't want to compromise
the durability so these keyboards are
pretty robust they can last quite a
while and we're really excited for them
pick that up and do a flex test for me
because that that's that's my kind of
trademark thing if we can get an angle
on that wrench on it because I always
wrench on it so you can see guys when
you have a cheap keyboard that thing is
going to flex to the point where you can
almost plot the keys off but even though
this
a 70 this is a $79.99 keyboard right so
that's getting down into the price
ranges of something like a high-end
membrane by an entry-level mechanical
not a high-end membrane I mean obviously
by a high-end mechanical if you can but
speaking of high-end mechanicals you
have some new stuff coming on the
high-end stuff to show me what we got
over here okay so in the past we've
mainly stuck with black switches so
we've done G unit g1 mecha with black
switches so what we decided to do this
year has come up with a lot more options
for people that want to buy red switches
brown switches blue switches so here
we're showing off the G unit with
different switches we have a blue a red
and a brown here the red one here we're
showing off even they illuminated the
full backlight version so we really want
to give people more options because
since new key switches are coming out
more and more Brown and red have become
really popular in the gaming market so
we want to be able to provide more
people more options depending on like if
you want a really heavy switch a light
switch just depends on what your
preferences now tell me if you tell me
about if you wanted a headset that was
designed in collaboration with BMW how
would you address that customer can can
you do that for me I would say let's uh
look over here right now because I think
that's a pretty tall order I'm throwing
out to here mind you we cheated a little
bit I did actually get a tour of the
booth before we started you know what
let's put ourselves right here and I'll
get you to stand right here
and you can talk about this I'm just
gonna lean over you here so tell me
about the level 10m gaming headset okay
so we just unveiled this this morning at
Computex in collaboration with BMW
design works USA it's our level 10m
headset it follows the design philosophy
of what we've released in the past the
level 10m Mouse and the level 10 case in
level 10 GT case from thermal tape so we
collaborated with them a lot of design
philosophies went in you can see this a
really like heavy style like more robust
metal so we decided that we're gonna
come out with a headset that's really
durable really stylish and something
that a lot of people will enjoy so show
me some of the robustness like this
looks like this looks like metal
components here that are part of the
sliding mechanism
and show me the microphone the way it
moves okay so yeah the the main
framework of the headset is aluminum so
we want to keep it like lightweight but
durable and really really hard
mold injected plastic for the ear cups
has 40 million for 40 millimeter sound
drivers on it and the microphone is
really really flexible so you can
position it it's got like a joint in
here you can position it depending on
your preference you can switch the cable
from the left or right side pretty
easily sometimes you know your desktop
might be on the right or the left side
so depending on how you want the
keyboard
sorry the headset cable to switch
positions you can do that with well I
actually I mean the way that I configure
my system is I like to have my headphone
cable draping across WASD so that so
that I can actually do both forward and
back movement at the same time just by
pressing on the cable do you think that
that's an optimal setup I mean I don't
think it's optimal but you can still do
that but this headset awesome I have the
power
definitely definitely check this out we
just renounced it on this morning so
it's going to be out on of course you're
covering it but you can also research it
on our website it's straight on the
front page awesome we got one more thing
that we want to have a look at over here
so show us show us this guy okay so for
people that commute definitely sometime
a problem is that you have to buy
separate headphones between gaming and
commuting you want to listen to music on
the subway or the the bus or whatever so
we designed a Bluetooth ready headset
that's also compatible with gaming so so
what you can do is it's a gaming headset
first and foremost so you have the
microphone but when you want to take it
out on the go you can actually unplug
and have it bluetooth ready with your
phone so you can stream music from your
phone in your pocket and just have it on
wirelessly and so can you give us a
little twirl it twirl here yeah thank
you do do a little turn on the catwalk
yeah little model work and another
interesting thing about this is even if
you don't really need the microphone you
can detach the cable and plug straight
into your PC so you have the option to
using
microphone no microphone pc wireless and
you can charge through USB so it's a
really sleek headset we're kind of
aiming to simplify the style a little
bit so it's not so much to look at me
when I'm commuting it's more of a just I
want to relax I want to get ready for
work things like that but you do have
look at me products can you put one of
those down for me really quick I want it
like let's just for contrast guys
thermaltake has such an enormous range
of products available and headsets here
let's uh let's let's let's let's get
this let's get the phone so if I didn't
want to wear this on the subway I could
wear that instead and I would have every
I would have the entire gamut of
designed in collaboration with BMW and
kind of striking but very stylish I'd
have that sort of that Wow holy crap
look at this guy he's got a gold headset
on and then you've got the more like you
know some guy who's just wants to chill
and please don't look at me yeah I mean
the design philosophy for our company is
that we want to have something for
everyone whether you want a simple sleek
design or you want something a little
bit more colorful a little bit more
complicated I mean we have something for
everyone we have you know we have a
headset for Xbox gamers we have
simplified mechanical keyboards for
people that want really like sleek
desktop so we make something for
everyone so it's it's kind of our design
philosophy we keep coming out with new
products and that's going to hit a
different style so that's what we're
looking forward to so it'll style
sometimes there's a performance reason
for what you do so right here what have
you done here exactly
okay so Theron has been a really
successful Mouse for us a lot of people
like it so we want to offer new color
options so we have white red and yellow
coming out with a glossy finish so just
depending on the style we have the old
traditional Theron was a rubber coating
so we wanted to add a little bit more
options comes with the same great laser
sensor that's in the original Theron but
here we have a new option which is a
Theron infrared it has a new infrared
optical sensor and this is built to
improve tracking for your gaming but
it's also a lower cost it's going to
come out about $10 u.s. cheaper than the
original Theron was
it's a lower-cost high performance
option for this mouse so to be clear for
69 or 70 9.99 so for 80 bucks plus about
55 bucks could you could you get a combo
here that you would feel comfortable
using regardless of who you you pretty
much are yeah I mean it's simple enough
but it's also stylish enough to really
take your game up to the next level
I even actually game with these two
they're on infrared and the presiding
keyboard right now I play a lot of
Starcraft so I'm really confident in the
fact that you can perform with these
products I actually didn't know that I
did not I did not cheat on that one so
thank you very much for joining us this
has been absolutely fantastic guys don't
miss any of our Computex 2013 coverage
and again thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
