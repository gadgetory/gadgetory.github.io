unboxing the gigabyte Radeon HD 5870 box
here it's quite a large box for a video
card so the focus technologies here are
obviously DirectX 11 support and ATI
affinity which is your your three
graphics displays all at the same time
you know it's funny actually the demo
they have here is left4dead which is
exactly what we used in our Radeon 5870
introduction and Eyefinity introduction
that we did on NCIX tech tips and ok so
let's get this box open we got a black
box here and when we open it we will
find the ATI Radeon series user's manual
and we will find a graphics accelerator
driver CD ok so the manual also includes
instructions for setting up the software
as well as installing the hardware on
your motherboard and enabling crossfire
so that's very useful ok then we will
find a piece of foam then under the not
forget under the foam we'll get to that
after then we will find a couple of
molex to PCI Express 6 pin adapters a
crossfire bridge and a DVI to VGA
adapter so exactly the same accessory
package as we found in the XFX card that
we already looked at so here's the card
itself let's get the tape peeled off and
you will notice some definite
similarities between this card and the
one that we checked out and the other
day here so first of all ok let's have a
look at gigabytes custom sticker so
they've got kind of a metallic looking
sticker on the front of the card itself
and then they've got flipping it around
to the back here the same sort of that
we'll be looking back end with two 6-pin
PCI Express connectors now something to
note about the 5850 is it's quite a bit
less power-hungry than the 5870
even though it has the same number of
power connectors so on the top you can
see that covered up by a little gigabyte
rubber cover are our two crossfire
bridge connectors and then on the back
of the card we've got no shroud like the
5870 just a bare PCB with a backplate
and then yeah you can just see all of
the all aspects of this card so the 5850
is a little
it's lower than the 5870 but you do get
quite a cost-savings so here under here
we will find DisplayPort under here we
will find HDMI I kind of like these
little these little port covers I think
they're kind of neat totally useless but
it's just kind of neat then we have two
DVI connectors so this is a dual slot
card and you can make use of up to three
of these connectors one of which has to
be the DisplayPort so this is a PCI
Express 16 X card and for just a quick
comparison even though we did a full
video comparing the 5850 and the 5870
I'm just going to show you and I've got
tape stuck on my hand
the 5850 versus the 5870 so there's
quite a bit of a size difference there
and thank you for checking out my video
