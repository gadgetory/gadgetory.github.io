this time it's BioShock Infinite we've
been asked for this a lot we're using
the very latest drivers available from
both the green team and the red team
because we wanted to make sure that
they've had a chance to put their
appropriate optimizations in before we
did our benchmarking sort of guide as
well as our showdown and I'm really
excited to show this to you guys so
let's start with our test bench we've
got a 39 60 X Extreme Edition processor
from Intel clocked at 4 gigahertz 16
gigs of kingston ddr3 is 1600 megahertz
ram an asus p9 x79 deluxe motherboard an
Antec thousand watt high current
platinum power supply a 128 gig SSD and
it's all cooled by a corsair h 100 now
obviously the graphics card changes but
we've got 4 different price points $100
$200 sort of an change $300 and $400 and
we're going to have the GTX 650 7770 gtx
660 7870 gtx 660ti which I've got in the
wrong spot 79 70 and finally the GTX 670
versus the 7970 methodology wise we'll
be doing our usual thing with a
two-minute run-through of actual
gameplay so if you guys are interested
slick does videos actually showcasing
exactly the run we do so you can follow
along and benchmark your own system with
BioShock Infinite and find out how it
stacks up against the stuff that we're
running here now I just wanted to remind
you guys that all of our video cards are
overclocked and the reason we do this is
that overclocking is easy and free and
there's pretty much no reason you could
do it yes technically some manufacturers
void the warranty little inside trick
they have absolutely no way of knowing
if you overclocked your cards so $100
price point seventy seven seventy versus
GTX 650 this was a bit of a trouncing
the 7770 I'll perform the GTX 650 by
about 30 percent which is definitely
tangible and definitely something that
you can feel when you're actually
playing the game now our $200 price
point has gotten a little bit a little
bit murkier is it $200 is it 250 not
quite sure the 7870 is around 229 and
the gtx 660 is around 239 what we do
know is that these cards are priced
quite so
so they should be pretty comparable and
what we experience is that they are the
7870 outperforms the 660 by about 5%
which for all intents and purposes is
just outside the margin of error that we
have for these runs because we are doing
real-world benchmarks as opposed to just
running a canned pre-done thing so it's
just the it's the nature of the beast
you can't do it perfectly exactly the
same every single time at our next price
point we have the 7950 and the gtx 660ti
and this one was a pretty significant
performance difference we're looking at
about 15 percent better performance with
7950 again bearing in mind both cards
are overclocked and the 7950 does tend
to overclock like a bit of a beast it
represents a very good value and has
actually done pretty well consistently
in all of these game show downs that
we've done and our last price point so
we've done a hundred two hundred three
hundred dollars so far is around four
hundred dollars so our 670 versus the
7970 was about a 10% difference in favor
of the 7970 so you can see that's the
one left on the bench here it was the
king of BioShock Infinite for our
testing bear in mind when I say King I
mean that sort of sort of King I mean
GTX Titan would obviously perform better
but it didn't fall into any of the price
points that we benchmarked that we find
our price points that real people would
actually be purchasing graphics cards
out I mean there are people buying
Titans but there's not like a ton of
them out there thank you for checking
out this benchmarking video while not
benchmarking video you can check out the
benchmarking video separately slick made
that but thank you for checking out our
performance showdown with this new
exciting installment of Bioshock
apparently a lot better than the second
one so that's a that's a good thing and
