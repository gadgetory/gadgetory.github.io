Frankenstein project I hope you can
actually hear me over top of it but I've
got to cool it Boreas tech coolers here
so these are using Peltier's to chill
the water and then I'm using some
standard water cooling stuff hooked up
to it in order to actually get the most
out of it so I've got an MC res micro
Swift tech MTP 350 I've got it connected
via some quick disconnects up to a swift
Tec Apogee okay so this is quite quite
chilly to the touch I've got a fan
blowing over the CPU socket to make it
so that I don't get any condensation
problems and water dripping on my
motherboard here the way I've actually
powered it is just totally don't do this
at home kids but I've actually taken the
two power connectors and then I've used
I'm just kind of jam them in there this
is an 8 pin connector he's even actually
get quite warm to the touch that's why I
have them positioned all around the fan
here every one of these the the Boris's
themselves are actually pulling about
400 watts just for the Peltier's so I'm
using a 1200 watt power supply to cool
this whole thing anyway I've got it
hooked up via an 8 pin power connectors
then I've soldered together and wrapped
up some wires and then Frankenstein that
together I've got this cool ik control
center hooked up just so that I can
monitor the cool intents but I don't
think they're right anyway um let me see
how I can actually show you the you know
what I'll run a quick benchmark here so
I'm running the the Fen em to 10 9dt
and I don't actually have cpu-z open at
the moment but I'll just fire that right
up here you can have a look so I've only
got it running at 4.2 gigahertz for the
time being and I haven't had any
problems of prime95 yet so I'm
definitely going to try and push it
further but I think the most impressive
part about this actually is here let's
stop the torture test and open up core
temp check this out the
cpu temps at idle oh well that shouldn't
be right yeah it's going down I think
it's actually going to take a while to
go back down after I start core temp but
oh yeah you can see here the low temp so
the lowest it's been and yeah it's going
to creep its way back down there now I
think it takes a while to update is zero
degrees so it actually idles at zero
degrees and then as soon as I fire up
the the torture test it jumps up to a
whopping blue fifteen degrees so that's
at 4.2 gigahertz under load you can see
the actual high once it's been running
for a while I've had it running is 22
degrees so that's running with the two
Boris's on a swift tech Apogee block so
that's an ancient Apogee this is
actually my first waterblock ever it
just has a new mounting plate on it so
it's been updated a little bit I also
put a bow on it as well
here into the Apogee you'll know what a
bow is anyway I guess that that pretty
much covers my little Frankenstein
project and I'm gonna give you some
overclocking updates as soon as I have
some you can see how high I can push
this 10.10 oh it's calling it a 1095 T
that's interesting I wonder if that's
some kind of omen anyway it's a 10-9 DT
let's see how high we can push it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
