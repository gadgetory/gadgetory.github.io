more welcome to my unboxing and first
look at the AVerMedia live gamer
portable now we covered the live gamer
HD not that long ago the main
disadvantage of the live gamer HD is
that it relies on a PCI Express slot in
order to operate so that means that if
you're recording PC footage then that's
fine because you have a PC that you're
using anyway so you might as well just
you know have the live gamer HD which is
great because it offloads
from the cpu with its hardware h.264
encoder and all that good all that good
stuff but it I mean it wasn't really the
optimal solution for console gamers who
want to record their gameplay because
you had to have a PC nearby this kind of
solves that problem and by kind of
solves that problem I mean completely
solves that problem in a really big way
this is the live gamer portable it comes
with three months of a premium license
for xsplit meaning you get the update
the upgraded audio codec which is the
most important thing about premium you
can also have more scenes it's okay
smart and sharp your all purpose sharing
weapon yeah yeah yeah all that good
stuff it's USB too so flexible
connectivity between PC and game
consoles USB interface for direct PC
connectivity a simple flip of the switch
for PC free mode there you go that's the
one that I think is most exciting about
this product because otherwise the PCI
Express version is already fantastic and
has this functionality so aha so they
say for class 10 SD HC cards fat32 this
one can operate without a PC now it
can't capture 1080p 30fps without a PC
dot because it just died whether it's
the bit rates or whatever else I think
the bit rates are up to 60 megabit per
second for 1080p 30fps with this
particular device so an SD card is just
not going to handle it but it will do
720p no problem
recording to an SD card and given that
you're probably recording from a console
in many of the games run in 720p or up
sampled 720p anyway you should be
getting most of the quality anyhow so
here you go pc mode SD card mode when
you're in PC mode what you do is you
plug it in via USB to and then you are
able to record from a variety of
different inputs including HDMI and AV
and so they include the adapters you
need in the box so we'll we'll get that
opened up a little bit here and then the
output so the pass-through is capable of
doing up to 1920 by 1080 60 fps so
basically what that means guys is you're
able to game at 60 frames per second and
record and stream concurrently at 30
frames per second it also uses the same
excellent software as the PCI Express
version so you've got a bunch of
advanced functionality it is so simple
to set up I have a number of capture
cards now including a Blackmagic
intensity Pro and an AVerMedia live
gamer HD their rec central is a billion
times easier to use you just press like
the easy setup mode one and then just
just goes like you don't have to worry
about it we actually did an NCIX tech
tips episode back when we got that card
showing how easy it was to use and there
really wasn't much of an advantage to
using expert mode unless you're really
fine-tuning things so audio in audio
capture is also possible so you can
either capture your commentary
constantly or you can mute it and go
sort of in and out of it much like the
live game or HD and this is something
that the more gaming oriented capture
cards don't have it has a hardware or it
has a hardwired button so you basically
just press that when you're ready to
record and the software itself stays
primed and ready to go so you just be
like yep I'm ready to go now here we go
and other than that that's it
there goes a motorcycle the device is
actually powered over USB as well as
accepting all the data that it needs
over USB so very very very cool so let's
go ahead and put that there and let's
have a look at what we've got included
in terms of accessories and yeah come on
out oh this is this is not working okay
so what's this xsplit broadcaster so
there's your three free months of xsplit
premium cool and then we've got gamers
own comm Abram and gamers own Davey
Mediacom so that's where you'll get the
latest rec central which like I said
before you will want because it's
excellent okay and then inside here
we'll get all the accessories including
presumably a component adapter so that
those Xbox 360 and ps3 gamers who either
don't have HDMI or can't use HDMI for
whatever reason will be able to connect
so there is yes okay what okay so that
yeah okay so there's one of our console
adapters so this goes out from here to
presumably I think that's a ps3 adapter
I'm not much of a console guy to be
perfectly honest those of you who
watched this regularly will already know
that so I don't even know or care what
that plugs into but the point is it
plugs into one of the consoles I think
it's a one I think it's ps3 that doesn't
support HDMI capture because of hdcp so
presumably that's ps3 xbox360 they're
probably assuming you're going to use
HDMI so they include an extra HDMI cable
because what you're doing is you're
adding a pass through so you're going to
go HDMI in from your console to this
okay and then you're going to get whoops
and then you're going to go out to the
TV now we did some gaming with the live
game or HD to find out sort of we were
like oh okay well if there's capture
hardware in here and if there's all of
that stuff going on is this going to add
any significant latency to the point
where it's going to affect the gameplay
experience and the answer is no we
didn't notice any difference between
running on a TV through the pass-through
versus running out directly to the TV
which is really important the last thing
you want to do is be in a situation
where it's like yeah I want to record my
epic gameplays and then the tool that
allows you to do that makes it so your
gameplays are not not so epic anymore
which
leads us into the rest of the
accessories that we have here below so
here's your straight component input so
there you can plug that into the adapter
as well so that's got your RGB as well
as your audio cables conveniently
color-coded so the blue ones are for
audio this has always been kind of funny
to me that the the labeling standards
for red component is the same as the
right channel for audio so that just
goes in there no big deal and then you
can run whatever component cables you
already happen to have on hand over
there and then we've also got a USB
connector which will be for using the
supplied mini USB cable is recommended
interesting so there you go maybe try
not to lose that although I mean I can't
really imagine there being any
difference but there you go so it's a 2
a 2 mini B there you go
and that powers it and as well as gives
you data and then they provide an audio
cable so because you're again you're
adding one because you have a
pass-through as well so commentary can
be enabled and disabled with a
push-to-talk or a hotkey button and the
footage is actually recorded with for to
to cut let's color depth would be the
right term for that right b-roll yeah 4
2 2 color depth so it's basically more
information than 4 to 0 for example but
it is recorded using an h.264 format and
the reason for that is we're limited by
the USB 2 data rate and quite frankly we
could end up limited by now I think USB
3 would be capable of capturing
uncompressed I mean it's not really the
intention of this device to replace sort
of professional-grade capture devices
where you're trying to capture with sort
of 4 4 4 color and you want uncompressed
footage that's going to record I mean it
would fill up this SD card in a matter
of seconds if you were capturing that
kind of footage so it's it's not the
intention but the idea here is using the
onboard encoder to give you a format
that's easy to work with preserves
enough of the color clarity that you're
going to be able to do whatever it is
you need to do with it bearing in mind
again you're not shooting with a cinema
picture profile or something like that
you're recording from a computer so the
way it looks when you record it should
pretty much be the way it's going to
look when you output it whereas with a
camera you want to record with sort of
weird profiles that allow you to do a
lot more in post-production see I'm
getting a smile for my crew because this
was stuff I never understood before they
they edumacated me and I was like no no
you want it to look good in the
viewfinder right and they're like no
it's not not actually what's important
the LED ring around the outside of the
button here can indicate to you whether
it's recording right now it can also -
so by the color as well as the
flickering of it you can tell exactly
what the device happens to be doing and
you can see here this was a sample
provided to Linus tech tips so I will be
definitely trying this guy out in fact I
guess it's possible we could use I mean
this will be super handy we could use
this to record mine and slick super
mario world livestream which would be
kind of freakin awesome because this is
portable we just check an SD card in
there and like yeah wow that's exciting
I didn't even think about that what else
can I say oh yeah time shift
functionality so what's cool about this
is it actually acts as a bit of a buffer
so instead of sort of oh you know I want
to record that but it just happened you
can actually use their time shift
functionality to go back and grab stuff
that you otherwise may have missed and I
think that's pretty much it I mean
honestly guys what sets this apart from
other capture devices because there's
other stuff out there haj has one sort
of the pro grade guys like Blackmagic
have stuff like their PCI Express cards
their external cards what sets us apart
it's the gaming optimized features it's
things like the excellent integration
with xsplit the aver media card was
easier to get working with xsplit
because I didn't have to dink around
with black magics software in order to
get it exactly the right way before it
actually works now it just worked ok so
there's that there's the fact that it
comes with the xsplit license for 3
months there's the fact that it has
functionality like oh I'm ready to
record now I'm not ready to record an
hour having that hardware button
actually is kind of handy and I mean
what else really sets it apart yeah I
mean the integration that's what's good
about it there you go and it works
really well it's more of a consumer
grade device that you don't really have
to fight with so thanks for checking out
my unboxing and first look at the live
gamer portable I will definitely give
you guys my full impressions of it once
we've actually used it but I'm basically
saying that it's awesome already just
based on my experience with the live
gamer HD so don't forget to subscribe
fly-ins tech tips from unboxings reviews
and other computer videos oh yeah it
comes with a sweet little case on the
box - I actually didn't show that during
the
boxing video so you go I wish it was a
little bit bigger and it had space for
the cables but I don't know I guess it's
it's padded so you can see there's some
padding to it it's going to prevent like
you know scratches and sort of
incidental accidental drops to the
actual delicate part of your machinery
something I also didn't mention before
is it doesn't support 1920 by 1200 so
1920 by 1080 only okay guys for the full
list of supported input and output
resolutions you're going to want to
check with avermedia also one thing that
I don't want to guarantee because I
haven't tried it I've only used HDMI
pass-through remember guys with a with
an analog input it is going to be doing
some processing inside before it can
output to HDMI so it might introduce
some input latency I don't know I
haven't tried that but with a hardware
encoder it shouldn't be much that's for
sure okay now I think I covered
everything and we're done see them every
media there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
