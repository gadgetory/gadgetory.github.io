probably got experience with your CPU
getting hot enough to boil water causing
your fans to spin up to blow dryer
levels and your performance to fall as a
result but what can you actually do
about that well in the fringe PC
performance tuning scene swapping out
generic manufacturer provided thermal
paste for high performance alternatives
has been found to improve CPU and
graphics card temperatures significantly
so we took one of the best products on
the market a liquid metal based material
to find out if we could improve the
cooling and performance of a gaming
laptop and spoiler alert it worked
really well and we're gonna show you
guys how to do it after we show you eks
muddler liquid cooling phoenix lineup
this is their next generation of modular
and all-in-one liquid cooling solutions
check them out at the link below and
thanks to ek for sponsoring this video
liquid metal has a thermal conductivity
of 73 watts per meter Kelvin this is a
staggering sixteen point two times
higher than even a good aftermarket
thermal paste like icy diamond
so then with performance like that why
is everybody not using it well there's
one big problem liquid metal is well
metal and that makes it not just
thermally conductive but also
electrically conductive so if you have a
slip up during application and it gets
on to the capacitors resistors or traces
on your CPU GPU or motherboard the only
thing your device will be good for is
making black smoke and even that only
for a short time so with all that in
mind we decided that the best laptop for
this job was the $3,000 Acer predator
Triton 700 this 18 point nine millimeter
thin laptop packs an Intel Core i7 7700
HQ and a GTX 1080 max-q but while it's
out of the box thermals are genuinely
impressive given its size under a
combined load it does experience thermal
throttling giving us an opportunity to
not only improve temperatures but also
potentially performance so before we
began we needed to establish a baseline
so we ran a fairly comprehensive battery
of tests then it was time to head down
to the workshop and get started this is
everything you'll need a set of
screwdrivers
we recommend the iFixit Pro Tech tool
kit some conformal coating electrical
tape cotton swabs and of course liquid
metal we chose thermal grizzly conductor
not a tin gallium and indium eutectic
alloy for it's insanely high thermal
conductivity and its endorsement from
overclocker extraordinaire Deir Bauer
now disassembly of your laptop if you're
following along will be different please
consult a guide online but the Triton
700 requires the removal of the bottom
screws
actually the keyboard area up top one
pro tip is to always be careful when
lifting pieces away from a laptop
because there may be fragile ribbon
connections that need to be removed
first with the heat shield and the fans
from either side of the heat sinks
removed finally we can get to what
you've all been waiting for removal of
the heat pipes and fins always undo the
socket mounting screws in reverse order
of the numbers by the screws and then
very carefully lift up from both sides
slowly working it until it all comes off
at once from here then it's goop removal
time for us this took an especially long
time because we were trying to get it
out from all the resistors and
capacitors surrounding the GPU die but
patience here is important these are not
only extremely fragile but they're also
the most likely thing to get shorted out
if our liquid metal application goes
poorly some isopropyl alcohol on a
cotton swab will help you get in between
them next step is to apply some
conformal coating to the areas around
the CPU and the GPU dies this stuff
forms an insulating layer that should
help prevent short-circuiting if our
liquid metal seeps out if you feel like
masking all day you can spray this stuff
on but to save time we applied two coats
15 minutes apart with a cotton swab
bringing us then to the do-or-die moment
application of our liquid metal it is
crucial that you only put a super small
drop on top of the die so that it
doesn't seep out very carefully put um
okay you know what we meant to do that
because without some liquid metal to
clean up for you how would we show you
what to do in the event of a spill sure
that's it
so anyway since it's metal you can't
just soak it up with a cloth but as it
turns out wiping it with alcohol can be
successful so after about half an hour
of cleaning we were ready to give it a
second go we
cleaned out this part strayed to allow
us to get the right amount just on the
tip of the applicator and then moved
over to the dye and actually that looks
about right now we're back on track so
then the next step is to spread it
around using the included cotton swab
until it makes a very thin film you want
it to be fully covered but it shouldn't
look like pooled up water then what you
do is rub any excess on the bottom of
the heatsink where it contacts the dye
the process was similar for the GPU
liquid metal on spread it around and
we're good to go we also added some
last-minute electrical tape just because
we were a bit sketched out and a
physical barrier is always a great
second line of defense so then with the
machine slapped back together
ah that super stupid boot sound I never
thought I'd be so glad to hear it
the laptop works although that's not
much of a surprise if you guys have been
paying close attention to the video now
anyway let's talk results now we were
expecting our temps to be a little
better but to be honest at least for me
anyway like I kind of thought the main
limiting factor was the dissipation
capacity of the tiny heat sinks that you
find in laptops not the thermal
resistance between the processors and
the heat pipes I was so wrong in i-264
we got a 20 degree improvement to CPU
temperatures under full synthetic load
and under a combined CPU and GPU load it
still gets hot sure it's a lot of heat
but nowhere near the overheating that we
saw before 3d mark saw modest
performance gains and then the team did
you guys really think we were gonna stop
there we fired up the intel extreme
tuning utility upped the turbo boost
time to as long as it will allow then we
hopped into MSI Afterburner to see how
much we could get out of the GPU and
with everything said and done we had our
GPU clock at nineteen fifty megahertz
and over five gigahertz on the memory
bringing us up to real GT X 1080 specs I
mean that that is proper crazy stuff in
a laptop as thin as this one so
recommend it absolutely as long as you
don't mind risking your device speaking
