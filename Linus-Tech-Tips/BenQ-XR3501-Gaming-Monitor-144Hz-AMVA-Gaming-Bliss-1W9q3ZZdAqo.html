for the entire PC and gaming media
industry when I say that we are sick of
hearing marketing people running around
saying this product is like optimized
for gaming it's the best for gamers I
mean you guys probably feel the same way
hit that like button if you're tired of
this crap I mean what does that even
mean for headphones and headsets it's
often the manufacturers way of saying
hey it's got rubbish sound but you don't
care or even notice anyway because
you're going to be too distracted by the
vibrant colors and flashing lights in
the case of motherboards it pretty much
means hey this performs exactly the same
in every possible way as a non gaming
model but it's a different color
enjoy and traditionally for monitors
it's meant
tn paddles they might have crummy color
and viewing angles but hey the pixel
switch a little faster and they're cheap
so uh gaming huh but maybe this is
different
maybe the XR 3501 is truly a gaming
monitor not only because it's just not
good enough for anything else but
because even the compromises that have
been made legitimately make it better
for gamers could it be true I guess
we'll find out
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
click on the link in the video
description to learn more so i'm going
to split this video into two parts part
1 will be the speeds and feeds the
specifications because for the most part
a monitor can be broken down into raw
numbers with better numbers equaling a
better monitor that's more worthy of
your hard-earned money so let's kick it
off with the physical tour
if the industrial design trend towards
slim panel assemblies and hyper thin
bezels reminiscent of a typical high
fashion runway model are your thing then
power to you but if you find more beauty
in the ronda rousey's of the world then
the XR 3501
might be your type this baby is thick
and imposing but not exceedingly bulky
nor is it by any means unattractive the
stand is an elegant looking dark chrome
finish affair with a red accent cable
management hole through the back end not
really much else to say about it
it does feature 20 degrees of tilt but
no swivel or height adjusts so you'll
need a beefy base amount and a transfer
kit if you want more flexibility in
terms of i/o I give it a c-plus in spite
of its size BenQ couldn't put the power
supply inside the XR 3501 so they supply
an external power brick there is no
built-in USB hub and while having both
DisplayPort and mini DisplayPort is nice
there's no DVI or VGA if you're ever in
a jam and the dual HDMI ports are
version 1.4 rather than 2.0 meaning that
the maximum reported refresh rate of the
panel when cooked up via HDMI is 60
Hertz
oh and I guess there's also a headphone
jack pass-through down there slightly to
the right of the i/o you will find the
on-screen menu controls which are not
very well labelled and it's kind of hard
to line up which button corresponds to
which dot I found it kind of frustrating
to navigate but all the usual options
are in there you can control pixel
overdrive you can set up Ben Q's black
equalizer feature if you want to see a
little bit more detail and dark areas of
the scene so I guess that leaves us
pretty
well around to the business end of any
monitor and let me tell you there is
some business going down there this is a
21 by 9 my favorite for those who've
been out of the loop for a while
aspect ratio monitor measuring 35 inches
diagonally so a touch larger but pretty
similar to models that I've used in the
past from LG and Acer featuring get this
a 2560 by 1088 bit a MVA panel running
at a hundred and forty-four Hertz and
boasting as good as four millisecond
response times Wow and there's more to
it too unlike those monitors I mentioned
Ben Q has added freesync adaptive
refresh rate support a huge plus for the
AMD gamers out there and gone super
aggro on the curvature of this display
with the XR 3501 featuring an
industry-leading 2000 R curve that would
give a circle of these monitors just
over half of the radius of a circle of
34 you see 97's holy crap but is that
even a good thing I mean obviously you
could curve a display so much that you
wouldn't even be able to use it anymore
so who has struck the right balance here
well I guess I'd say it depends on the
use case for productivity and office use
I like to feel like there's a world
beyond whatever project I'm working on
at the moment a subtle curve is good in
that case for gaming wrapping the
display around me letting it hold me
type that is an experience worth having
and that's the XR 3501 in a nutshell
whether you're into shooters racing
games flight Sims whatever it is one
hell of an experience the pixel response
times aren't anything to write home
about if you're coming from a fast TN
like the Zeus PG 278 q but the 144 Hertz
refresh rate and out standing contrast
coupled with practically non-existent
backlight bleed and a lack of IPS glow
thanks to the AMD a panel more than make
up for it in my mind and on the subject
of the AMD a panel let's change gears
and get empirical for a minute this
thing freaked
in rocks for color performance these
Kalinin five charts show just over srgb
Gannett coverage and the best
out-of-the-box accuracy that I've seen
since I got my hands on my eye one basic
Pro to display calibrator I mean we're
talking almost nothing with a Delta II
of greater than two
you could photo edit on this thing right
out of the box awesome right
hold on there is a big gotcha that I
glossed over earlier and I have to come
back to now that resolution I mean I get
it
this is a gaming monitor and in that
context this trade-off actually makes a
lot of sense because at 34 40 by 1440
there isn't a display interface today
that can handle 144 Hertz not to mention
that hardly a graphics card in existence
would be able to drive that resolution
at 144 frames per second but that many
pixels at this kind of size is not a
Retina display and in fact as I
mentioned in my video on the LG 34 um 67
it's quite unpleasant for me to use
outside of games because on screen
elements look unnaturally large like
someone turned the scaling up too high
and some graphics even seem to lose
fidelity when viewed like this with
black lines ending up with weird colored
glows around them but with all of that
said this is truly a gaming monitor it
is intended to be purchased and used by
people who will game on it primarily
with creating spreadsheets in Excel as a
distant afterthought and as such I
consider it a smashing success if you're
more productivity focused I still love
my high resolution LG's if you're
somewhere in the middle Acer 75 Hertz XR
341 CK is a great middle ground but if
you're a gamer to the core I agree with
Ben Q's product design teams choice to
go all-in with this lower resolution and
super tight curve 144 Hertz panel and
the XR 3501 is my new
updog gaming monitor especially if
you're running an AMD graphics card and
you can take advantage of free sync
adaptive refresh rates so thanks for
