280 and you might be wondering why I had
such a big smile on my face to start
this video and the answer is quite
simple because I believe the P 280 is a
true return to form for an Tek this is
one of the most innovative and no diss
opening up these seals this is one of
the most innovative case designs that I
have seen in a very long time and it is
a true update to the original P 180
we've seen incremental updates like the
P 182 and the P 183 but we haven't seen
anything that I would consider a
reimagining up until now so let's go
ahead take this bad boy out and you know
what I'm going to do I'm going to take
that box here and I'm just going to put
it here we're going to have a look at
some of the features before we get
started so one is you can install up to
13-inch graphics cards I'm going to get
some more light for you here so you can
actually read this quiet computing so it
uses a dual layer design with steel and
polycarbonate side panels ease of use
and we'll talk a lot about that but it
includes grommet line cable management
holes and tons of space for managing
cables tool is five and a quarter inch
bays quiet three to half inch bays and
these are these are cool okay - front
panel USB 3 ports and advanced cooling
system including three fans and for
additional fan mounts so yes you can
have quiet and you can have cooling
triple layer aluminum plastic and foam
front bezel with double hinged door
opens up to 270 degrees finally PSU
intake and front air filters which are
very easy to take out and clean compared
to designs that I've seen from an tech
and their competition in the past so
let's go ahead take off this foam ntek
always packs their cases very well in
closed cell foam which is much less
susceptible to damage during transit and
much more durable much more reusable
than other stiffer less durable kinds of
foam
go ahead take this plastic off very
excited to see this case because it
arrived in the mail a little while ago
and I haven't actually had a chance to
check it out yet even though I've seen
pictures and I've seen specs and I've
seen where to go our reviewers guide I
haven't actually seen the case in person
yet so let's get some lighting on that
front panel well we we feel the finish
on there so this is about what I'd
expect from in tech in terms of the
overall quality of materials I mean the
p180 had a beautiful metal finished
front door and the P 280 continues in
that proud tradition we've got 2 USB 3
ports and 2 USB to ports with the front
panel we've got our microphone jack as
well as headphone jack and let's go
ahead and open this thing up so here we
see the foam sound dampening material we
also see the three five and a quarter
inch base and you guys are going to love
this the gamers are going to love this
because what kind of gamer is not lazy
and doesn't like our end likes to work
hard to take out the filters hold on
okay so this is step one to take off the
filter that was it step one take off the
filter now you can access the 120
millimeter cooling fan slots that are in
the front you can also see your three in
a half inch bays which are double
purpose because you can mount two to
half inch drives in them there you go
that's the whole thing nice honeycomb
grille design to protect it give it some
rigidity but that is how easy it is to
take out and clean your fan filter
simply astounding in terms of airflow
ntek has not forgotten in spite of the
fact that this is a silent silent
concept case they've not forgotten
airflow so look at these huge gaps
between the side of the door and the
closing point which are going to give
those front ends the airflow that they
need in order to not suffocate and
actually here speaking of the door
swinging open there I want to show you
guys the 270 degree hinge so you just
snap that out put that over there a lot
of people complain about front case
doors personally I like them what I
really don't like to see is the power
and the reef
switch hidden behind the front door
because as much as I don't need to see
my five and a quarter inch bays I very
rarely use my optical drive and I don't
need to see my fan filter I do need to
turn my case on and off so an tech has
repositioned the power and reset
switches for this case to the top in a
very convenient user-friendly location
compared to what we've seen from their
competition as well as from an tech in
the past we've got two 120 millimeter
cooling fans up here which are spaced
correctly for a dual radiator for those
of you who are interested in running one
of those very very cool good foresight
and then we take off the side panel
where we see the polycarbonate layer as
well as the metal layer on the side
panel that gives us some stiffness it
also gives us some weight this is not a
light case so you know don't imagine
you're going to be easily hauling it
around to land parties unless you're
like you know huge like me right yeah
that's right okay so moving on uh where
should we start on the inside you know
what let's start with the fan filter
since we've talked a little bit about
that already on the outside this fan
filter oh it doesn't come out it doesn't
come out oh that's because it comes
locked from the factory so now I can
easily remove it that's the filter for
your power supply intake and then when
you put it back in you don't have to
lock it you can make it easy but if
you're going to ship your case or
something like that you just push on it
and now it's locked
the reason Antec designed it this way is
just because during shipping they don't
want these fan filters coming out and
getting damaged in the box so there you
go personally I would always keep that
on lock so I can easily clean it and
there you go all right what else we got
me with a little bit of successor II
there's a little piece paper here's some
cable ties which will help you manage
your cables here's some hardware and
screws hard drive screws all that good
stuff so silent concept case does that
mean we can't put an extreme gaming
machine in here well I would postulate
no it does not mean that because check
this out an tech has included in the P
289 expansion slot so yes that means you
can install crazy enthusiast
motherboards with up to nine expansion
slots this is an XL ATX case so you can
put pretty much anything in it because
it supports long leather
towards slightly wider than normal
motherboards but not fully ATX server
board so stuff like the rampage series
from Asus which tends to be a little bit
wider that'll be no problem and it also
supports long graphics cards up to 13
inches which is longer than anything
else on the market now we've got rubber
grommets here for cable management and
they've also sensibly positioned the
rubber grommets a lot of the time you
see one down here and then you see one
up here and kind of one up here but
obviously you can't pull out twice as
many cables as you put in in the first
place so an techs giving you room to put
them in here and here pull them out here
here here here and here we've also got
AA are three and a half inch or two and
a half inch drive adapter so here's the
Caddy's there's your two and a half inch
holes there's your three and a half inch
holes with rubber silicon silicon mounts
very solid compared to competing
solutions these have a lot of durability
to them and they're not flimsy at all so
there's six of those ah what else we got
here let's go ahead and undo this front
panel connectors I like that these are
black for the most part wouldn't have
minded seeing all black but I guess it's
not the end of the world because you can
hide them very easily down the rubber
grommets in there so I wouldn't worry
too much about it there's your front
panel connectors so that's your hard
drive LED power LED oh no hard drive LED
oh yeah there's the hard drive LED and
then we've also got what else here USB
to front audio and USB 3 with um with a
header so rather than with using the
cheesy you know go around the back and
plug into the i/o shield we have a nice
molded plastic header piece there so
what else do ya oh yeah tool is five and
a quarter these are actually these are
smart so what happens is when you slide
in your drive it's going to push out
this and then it's going to drive that
pin right into the side of your drive no
big deal and then you've also got two
holes left over here as well as here if
you want to secure it with screws like
say for example for shipping so that's
awesome alright what else we got 120
millimeter cooling fan is over here
we've got those 120 millimeter cooling
fans that are in the top up here we've
also got cooling fan controls over here
so that's on a little PCB there we're
going to want to power that up and then
you can use the switches at the back of
the case which I haven't shown you yet
to control the speeds of your fans
you got your water cooling grommets
these are pretty standard these days and
Oh check this out that is a huge CPU
cooler mount our CPU cooler cut out so
that's going to allow you pretty much no
matter where your CPU socket is located
to easily you replace a backplate and
not have to take the motherboard out of
the case in order to do it so I'm just
taking off a couple of thumb screws here
and the camera is apparently following
me so I'm gonna have to turn it around
and show you guys alright some screws
off case open so same thing we got the
polycarbonate on the side panel there go
ahead and put that aside for now check
this out tons of cable management room
look how much space there is I'm gonna
like Jam my hand in there for emphasis
lots of room to manage cables behind the
motherboard tray
antek has also included little clips so
you can easily manage your cables where
exactly they're going use zip ties you
can secure the cables down nice and flat
so that you don't interfere with trying
to close a side panel it's become with a
lot of cases they're like as we go if
cable management holds but then when you
actually go to close the side panel it's
like sitting on a suitcase so very very
challenging in that regard on the back
here we've also got a large hole for
putting up to two EPs 8 pin connectors
through here and then we've also got a
hole up here so this is the one I
mentioned before where you can run your
front panel connectors and whatnot
through here without interfering with
any of your five and a quarter inch base
and without having to look at any of
these cables in order to run them down
to the bottom of your motherboard I
think that pretty much covers it but
give me a moment here guys so two more
things guys one is the actual dimensions
back here is three centimeters so even
fat 24-pin cables will fit and the other
thing is here are the controls for the
two cool fans that are included too cool
for school that is so you can go ahead
and turn
to low or high in order to get either
low cooling and low noise or high
cooling and higher noise so thank you
for checking out my unboxing and
overview and first look at the an Tek p2
80 don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos one feature that I
actually missed on this case and it's
been so long since I realized I missed
it but I've actually already installed a
system in it because I went to mount the
SSD know oh yeah it's got that handy SSD
mount that's just a pressure mount so
you go ahead and you slide your SSD in
here and it's secure enough so you can
still get here you can see I can pull on
it a little bit it doesn't go anywhere
if I pull on it a lot then it comes so
that is how you mount an SSD in the p2
80 in addition to being able to mount an
SSD on any one of the drive sleds
anytime you want to sorry about that and
now I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
