ShamWow now one of my co-workers bought
one and so I figured what the hey let's
do an unboxing of the ShamWow so you'll
say WOW every time according to Vince
the guy with the criminal record now
because of the incident in Vegas but
don't let that take away from his
credibility okay so Jeff actually you
know what I'm gonna go off camera I'm
going to ask my coworker why he bought
this so he claims that he bought it
because apparently they're good for
cleaning your bike so there you go okay
look let's let's open up the box clean
spills fast machine wash will last for
years clean more and work less these are
super absorbent towels as seen on TV
they're made in Germany all right
shambleau is a towel chinois and sponge
all in one you can use it over and over
wash dry and polish machine washable
bleach able and will last for years okay
so that's pretty much the same thing
that it said before home car spills pet
stains vacuums and more and the
directions okay directions are really
important so directions use on
everything for best results wash or wet
the ShamWow towel before using something
about vinegar pet stains use white
vinegar to eliminate the smell okay care
instructions let's open it up okay
finally finally rope we're opening up
the ShamWow so this is an eight pack of
shamwows you actually get oh you know
what we should be we should be doing
like the ding sound effect and then I'm
just I said just be gesturing as they
all appear on the table so you actually
get four mini shamwows okay then finally
there's another one you get more
instructions about how to clean spills
fast and for full-sized shammies so the
full-size ones are about this big so I'm
gonna do some testing here so my first
benchmark will be an absorbency
benchmark so we're gonna just go ahead
and fill up the brand-new chamois with
as much water as we can and then we're
going to see
how much water it holds now they claim
no drips but I'm not entirely convinced
that is accurate on account of okay hold
on a second that's not bad
it's not dripping anymore but if I put
it in my hand then it starts to drip so
okay so now we've we've discovered
something about the chamois that we
perhaps didn't know before now now we'll
do we'll do the old bring it out water
test so let's see how much water comes
out of it Oh check this out it's green
water so we're getting a little bit of
the dye from the from the chamois coming
out with the water so check this up you
go you got a look at the sink to see the
green water here oh yeah green water
very nice okay okay so now now let's see
how useful it's gonna be for cleaning my
co-workers bike here so this is this is
my co-workers bike it's a lot nicer than
my bike as you can clearly see here come
on come on he's he's the one holding the
camera today so but why don't you do do
some Dudesons do some you know show up
show up jobs here of your bike and I'll
I'll try not to bump it too hard you
know cuz I cuz I'm not jealous or
anything so so this is what he's
intending to do with it
ooh clean bad that was that's pretty
much that's pretty much all I got so
there you have it my unboxing of the
ShamWow Lane as it may be don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech tips for know
videos like this I'm not going to do
this again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
