a new product from Microsoft that's
actually pretty exciting this is the
lifecam cinema and the biggest feature
on this camera is that it is true 720p
HD with clear smooth video so basically
what that means is webcams are finally
HD so let's get this baby open and
actually you know what let's have a look
at the back first so here it outlines
some of the important new features of
this particular webcam first of all you
got 720p which we already mentioned at
30 frames per second world world-class
optics so they're using an actual glass
element lens rather than a plastic lens
which is what you typically see on a
webcam clear high quality video they
show an example of clear versus standard
video now one moment we're actually
going to do our next unboxing using this
camera so we'll see exactly how good
that clear high quality video is next is
you've got Pistol clear audio so they're
saying they've got a digital noise
cancelling microphone right on the top
of the aluminum unit so let's get this
baby open and here we go so first we're
going to find the USB cable covered in a
little sticker that protects it
presumably and it also warns you that
you should install the driver software
before you plug in the webcam okay so
there's our little genuine microsoft
shiny sticker gotta love that okay what
else do we have a hero I see what looks
like a disc so it's in about a zillion
different languages most of which I
cannot read but i found this start here
excellent okay so let's open this up
kind of a that's kind of a clever little
box set it opens up like that and here
we go start here again so this is your
Quick Start Guide and it's going to just
crank it up here so that I can reach a
little bit better so it shows you okay
you install the driver you plug in the
USB then you position your camera and
then presumably you use it okay they
want you to use msn messenger that's
perfectly appropriate there we go
there's your life cams people annoy
software you're probably better off to
download the latest drivers off the
Microsoft website however okay then
product guide yeah okay so
let's get to the product itself so let's
pull it out of the packaging here I can
yeah there we go and then we got a
little plastic window so that we can
present the product in a retail store
then I'm going to have to try and figure
out how this comes off Wow let's go four
step process so there we go we removed
that piece and then we can go like this
and now oh no there we go there we go
and then we can remove this no you can't
remove the plastic piece okay so we're
gonna just pull the cable out which i
can not quite do yet okay there okay we
finally got it out but I still have it
in a little oh hey plastic clamshell
comes off right there and there it is
awesome oh this is cool actually here
that's got a flexible little stand here
so you can actually hook it on to
anything it's got a pretty good feel to
it it's kind of rubberized so it's
really really grippy and that's really
neat you know we've got a monitor right
here I'm just going to get the cameraman
to point it to monitor so I can
demonstrate just how this works so you
hook it at the front and then you just
throw the little grippy bit on there and
you can aim it at any angle you want and
it actually rotates here as well so
that's that's a really cool mounting
system i really like that and then
there's one button on the top which has
a picture of a phone and and a phone
okay and then you've got a microphone
and that is it that is the unit itself
there's your little HD logo you can see
the glass lens in there just going to
turn it around so we'll see you can
actually turn it all the way around and
thank you for checking out my unboxing
stock of the lifecam cinema</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
