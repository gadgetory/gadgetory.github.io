a new product from Microsoft that's
actually pretty exciting this is the
LifeCam cinema and the biggest feature
on this camera is that it is true 720p
HD with clear smooth video so basically
what that means is webcams are finally
HD so let's get this baby open and
actually you know what let's have a look
at the back first so here it outlines
some of the important new features of
this particular webcam first of all you
got 720p which we already mentioned at
30 frames per second world world-class
optics so they're using an actual glass
element lens rather than a plastic lens
which is what you typically see on a
webcam clear high quality video they
show an example of clear versus standard
video now one moment we're actually
going to do our next unboxing using this
camera so we'll see exactly how good
that clear high quality video is next is
you've got crystal-clear audio so
they're saying they've got a digital
noise cancelling microphone right on the
top of the aluminum unit so let's get
this baby open and here we go so first
we're going to find the USB cable
covered in a little sticker that
protects it presumably and it also warns
you that you should install the driver
software before you plug in the webcam
okay so there's our little genuine
Microsoft shiny sticker gotta love that
okay what else do we have in here oh I
see what looks like a disc so it's in
about a zillion different languages most
of which I cannot read but I found this
start here excellent okay so let's open
this up kind of a that's kind of a
clever little box it opens up like that
and here we go start here again so this
is your Quick Start Guide and it's gonna
just create it up here so that I can
reach a little bit better so it shows
you okay you install the driver you plug
in the USB then you position your camera
and then presumably you use it okay they
want you to use MSN Messenger that's
perfectly appropriate there we go
there's your life cam people enjoy
software you're probably better off to
download the latest drivers off the
Microsoft website however okay and then
a product guide okay so
let's get to the product itself so let's
pull it out of the packaging here I can
yeah there we go and then we've got a
little plastic window so that it can
present the product in a retail store
and then I'm gonna have to try and
figure out how this comes off wow that's
a four step process so there we go we've
removed that piece and then we can go
like this and oh no there we go there we
go and then we can remove this no we
can't remove the plastic piece okay so
we're gonna just pull the cable out
which I can not quite do yet okay there
okay we finally got it out but I still
have it in a little Oh a plastic
clamshell comes off right there and
there is awesome oh this is cool
actually here it's got a flexible little
stand here so you can actually hook it
on to anything it's got a pretty good
feel to it it's kind of rubberized so
it's really really grippy and that's
really neat you know what we've got a
monitor right here I'm just gonna get
the cameraman to point it to monitor so
I can demonstrate just how this works so
you hook it up the front and then you
just throw the little grippy bit on
there and you can aim it at any angle
you want and it actually rotates here as
well so that's that's a really cool
mounting system I really like that and
then there's one button on the top which
has a picture of a phone and and a phone
okay and then you've got a microphone
and that is it that is the unit itself
there's your little HD logo you can see
the glass lens in there just gonna turn
it around so we'll see you can actually
turn it all the way around and thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the
LifeCam cinema</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
