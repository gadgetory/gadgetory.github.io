the p7p55d so this is the vanilla board
they've got a lot of different suffixes
but this one has a 12 + 2 phase power
design crossfire but no sli support and
it uses a hundred percent Japanese
capacitors it's windows 7 ready like
every p55 board and let's get this thing
open up and have a look at the accessory
package so we've got a pretty bare-bones
accessory package you can see we've got
an i/o shield we've got the motherboard
manual along with the drivers and
applications DVD we've got an ID cable
then we've got there there little
connector thingamajig ease we have four
SATA cables to right angle and two
straight and then let's get to the board
itself so pull out their green a hundred
percent non styrofoam packaging here
let's get this board out here we go so
give me two seconds here let's have a
look so like all p55 boards well it's
the usual thing we've got support for
dual-channel ddr3 memory right here
we've got asustas memo k technology
which sets your memory to the bone stock
default so you can post the board with
pretty much any ram in it we've got
seven SATA ports down at the bottom here
there's your USB now let's have a look
at the slots here so we've got a 16 x
pci express slot and then another one
these will run in 8 X 8 X mode if you're
using crossfire we've got a couple pci e
1x lots three pci now they're using
these cool i really like these they
remind me of like you know superman's
fortress of solitude or whatever you got
like your icicle looking coolers on the
MOSFETs as i mentioned before we've got
a 12 plus 2 phase power design here's
your 1156 socket let's have a look at
the back of the board here and what
we've got for i/o so here's your ps2
keyboard and mouse then we've got eight
USB ports right there there and there
we've got digital audio but only optical
not coaxial we've got firewire e-sata a
gigabit ethernet and
7.1 audio so thank you for checking out
