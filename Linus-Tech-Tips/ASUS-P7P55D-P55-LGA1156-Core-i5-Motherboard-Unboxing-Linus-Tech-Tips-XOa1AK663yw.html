unboxing the P 7 P 55 D so this is the
vanilla board they've got a lot of
different suffixes but this one has a
full +2 phase power design crossfire but
no SLI support and it uses 100% Japanese
capacitors it's Windows 7 ready like
every p55 board and let's get this thing
opened up and have a look at the
accessory package so we've got a pretty
bare-bones accessory package you can see
we've got an i/o shield we've got the
motherboard manual along with the
drivers and applications DVD we've got
an IDE cable then we've got their their
little connector thingamajig ease we
have four SATA cables to right angle and
two straight and then let's get to the
board itself so pull out there green a
hundred percent non styrofoam packaging
here let's get this
oh here we go so give me two seconds
here let's have a look so Michael p55
boards well it's the usual thing we've
got support for dual channel ddr3 memory
right here we've got a Seuss's mem okay
technology which sets your memory to the
bone stock default so you can post the
board with pretty much any ram in it
we've got seven SATA ports down at the
bottom here there's your USB now let's
have a look at the slots here so we've
got a 16 X PCI Express slot and then
another one these will run in 8 X 8 X
mode if you're using crossfire we've got
a couple PCIe 1x slots three PCI now
they're using these cool I really like
these they remind me of like you know
Superman's fortress of solitude or
whatever you got like your icicle
looking coolers on the MOSFETs as I
mentioned before we've gotten twelve
plus two phase power design
here's your 1156 socket let's have a
look at the back of the board here and
what we've got for i/o so here's your
ps2 keyboard and mouse then we've got
eight USB ports right there there and
there we've got digital audio but only
optical not coaxial we've got firewire
eSATA a Gigabit Ethernet and then 7.1
audio so thank you for checking out my
video
log on the p7p 55d</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
