instructional video for anyone who
bought a fractal design define r2 case
and is affected by a problem with the
wiring in the front USB port we've got a
forum thread going on in our forum about
how the wires are crossed which means
that if you plug any USB peripheral into
the front USB port it won't work for one
thing and there's a chance that it will
be damaged so what we recommend you do
is actually just wait fractal design is
addressing the problem they're sending
us for placement cables which we will be
able to send out to every customer who
bought one or who buys one in the next
little while here but if you want to
MacGyver yourself a solution there is a
way to do it all you have to do is take
your side panel off okay so taking the
side panel off and then you will have to
pop off the front bezel so that means
that you just kind of get under you here
pry it up from the bottom there's a
little grip at the bottom that you can
hold on to I should probably show you
that you see that gap right there so I'm
just gonna grab onto that and then pry
it up if I have straight there we go
okay so once you pry it up you just need
to carefully remove the front bezel from
the case just like this there's a little
gap here you'll need to pull these
connectors through and then you need to
locate the USB cable so this cable right
here is the one that fractal design is
going to be replacing with ones that are
wired correctly the problem is that this
USB plug that goes into your motherboard
is wired wrong the red cable here and
the green cable are not carrying the
correct voltage and the correct signal
and they are actually carrying what is
supposed to be the other so even though
the coloring should be red white green
black that is not correct in this case
so we are we are telling users that
while it's not the best solution the
best thing is to wait for fractal design
to address the issue what they can do is
simply swap the two cables so you need a
little tiny flat-head screwdriver or a
needle or a pin what you need to do is
get it under the little tab I'm gonna
sort of sorry I know
cameraman can really see it okay so you
get that under the little tab you pull
out the red cable then you go along to
the green cable you get under the little
tab here you need to be very careful not
to lift these up too high because
they're just little plastic tabs and you
can damage them once you've removed the
green and red cable from the one side
you can plug it in make sure you push
the tab back down and then check to make
sure that it's locked into place so I've
put the green cable where the red one
was and then I'm putting the red wire in
where the green one was just like that
once you've made this swap the case
front panel USB will work and there's no
need to get a replacement cable if
you're totally comfortable with this
what you've effectively done is made
sure that the right cables are carrying
the right signal so I want you to
compare the side that I have corrected
it goes green white red black to the
side that I have not corrected which
goes red white green black or actually
so that you can see them from the same
from the same angle here's what it looks
like so the top one is the corrected one
that I have that I have done with this
case and the bottom one is the incorrect
one even though that is the official
wiring coloring for USB so that was just
a quick guide on how to how to MacGyver
yourself a solution to this problem if
you don't want to wait for a new cable
