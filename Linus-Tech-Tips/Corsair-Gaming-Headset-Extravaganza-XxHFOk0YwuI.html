course our gaming headsets to have a
look at today starting with the Raptor
line and ending with the Vengeance 2100
s lots of new stuff here this is 2100
soar Corsairs flagship wireless
headphones they are an updated version
of the 2000s and honestly there isn't
that much that's different
included with them we have Corsairs USB
audio / wireless dongle we've also got a
little extender base station for it so
you can have it in the front of your PC
and then still plug it into the back and
finally we have a charging cable that
can be used to charge the ten-hour
battery of the Vengeance 2100 s or run
them in Wired power mode so that you can
have an unlimited amount of gameplay
time next up we've got the headphones
themselves which have an updated ID with
a brushed dark look that I actually
think looks much better than the
original vengeance 2000s they have the
same overall softness so a nice cushy
extremely wide headband as well as nice
cushy and soft although not um not like
out of the box off but more the type of
foam that molds to your head over time
but nice deep ear cushions
they have been updated for better
durability so if there was anything that
people didn't like about the 2000 it was
probably that they seem to have
durability issues the 2100 s I seek to
completely address that they have 50
millimeter drivers just like the rest of
course there's high-end headphones
actually the 2000s used to have better
drivers than the rest of the lineup but
more on that in just a moment
and finally they use microfiber cloth on
the memory foam ear cups so that you're
going to be nice and comfortable and not
have you know sweaty pleather against
your skin because for some people I know
that is an issue looking at you Jeremy
next up we have the Vengeance 1500 v2s
now I don't see these being officially
called v2 anywhere but someone said that
to me at PAX or something so I'm rolling
with it and they definitely have been
updated in enough of a way that I would
say it justifies a v2 moniker so they
come with Dolby headphone right out of
the box that supports 5.1 or 7.1 or
something like that you know virtual
speakers around your head they of course
to support that functionality have a USB
soundcard built into them just like
Corsairs previous 1500 however unlike
the previous 1500 they have the newer 50
millimeter drivers just like the
Vengeance 2000 they have a newer ID that
again I think looks quite a bit better
although it's so similar to the 2100 s
it actually sort of raises the question
why they bothered to change it's like
well we put a Corsair logo here instead
of here either way they both look really
good so when I say that they look very
similar I'm not saying that's
necessarily a bad thing just like the
previous Vengeance 1500s they have
inline volume control as well as a mute
button which has actually been
streamlined a little bit made a little
bit more low-profile and just like the
Vengeance 2100 so they have microfiber
covered memory foam on the ear cups
which are going to mold to your head
over time is a nice wide headband as
well as a boom mic that can be adjusted
according to how you need it to be
positioned one thing I that I very I'm
very sorry I missed on the Vengeance
2100 is the volume wheel as well as the
power button over here the volume wheels
key because the other headphones have
inline volume control so I that's
different I guess at this point we might
as well just stop pretending that we're
unboxing things at all here and we're
going to kick off with the vengeance
1400 it adds the same better 50
millimeter drivers to the 1300s in much
the same way that the 1500 v2 adds those
better drivers to the 1500s it has the
same upgraded ID so I'm going to do my
little turn on the catwalk I don't think
that's how they normally turn on the
catwalk but we're not too worried about
that the inline volume control is also
also less bulky now and unlike the 1500
v2 s we have analog connectors so if
you're using something like your own
sound card or an external USB DAC or
something along those lines then this
will be the option to go with I actually
feel quite strongly that analogue
connectors on my headphones make more
sense for me because I am less
interested in fancy surround software
and more interested in having a better
quality source for the audio although
your mileage may vary on all of this and
if you want Wireless then you don't
really have the option of analog at all
because the whole thing has to be
powered by something so they tend to be
USB and they get down
you know circuitry inside the headphones
to do things unless you like built like
a battery pack let's strap to your neck
and like you know a sound card into the
bottom or something and just when you
thought our unboxing couldn't get any
less unboxing I'm not even going to open
this one because this is the HS 40 which
is pretty much the same thing as the HS
30 but with a USB connector rather than
an analogue connector so I actually have
two of these except that I don't because
Corsairs PR and their marketing each
sent me one and then they both sent me
just the HS 40 because it's pretty much
the same as the HS 30 thinking that I
could just you know sort of make do
without that one and then the funny
thing is they sent me two headsets but
then I ended up with doing the same one
instead of two different ones anyway so
the wraptor line is course there's more
value oriented gaming peripherals they
call them gaming essentials and I think
they've really achieved that because
they're still comfortable they're the HS
40 is surround but not not Dolby
Surround so it still has the same
implementation that vengence 2000 had
back when it was released their lower
cost so they can with 40 millimeter
neodymium drivers versus 50 millimeter
drivers there's no memory foam and they
use LED thread instead of microfiber
cloth but overall they're still
comfortable they're still lightweight
they still have you know a boom mic they
still have inline volume control but
it's a little bit bulkier so it just
comes down to how much of a budget do
you have do you want to spring for the
higher-end vengence that you know has a
little bit of a nicer like matte look or
are you okay with the raptors and their
lower cost and you know proportionally
lower performance thank you very much
for checking out our unboxing and
overview of Corsairs
new headset lineup and that's the door
so we're gonna end this now like the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment if you have
