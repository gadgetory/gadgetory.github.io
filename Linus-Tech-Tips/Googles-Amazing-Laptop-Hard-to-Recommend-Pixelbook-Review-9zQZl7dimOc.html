of nowhere and completely pulled the rug
out from under Internet Explorer and
Firefox then Android stormed from zero
to half of the phone market in almost no
time at all then we got Chrome OS a
Google polished version of Linux for the
low-power machine that you let your kids
use when Daddy needs the real computer
and not much more could that change
though the pixel book is a laptop with
main rig specs and premium design with a
price to match but is Chrome OS ready
for that kind of responsibility now no
no it's not and our argument for why is
brought to you by tunnel bear tunnel

bear comm slash LTTE linked below
right out of the gate the pixel books
design is polarizing some people really
like the two-tone back while others
think it is outright ugly but what I
think everyone can agree on is the build
quality it is excellent and it's super
portable to it only ten millimeters
thick and 2.4 pounds
honestly the list kind of goes on from
here the screen and the hinge feels
solid the aluminum chassis is rigid and
it stays firmly planted where you put it
down whether it's on the table or on
your lap due to the large rubber surface
on the bottom I oh wise yeah it's pretty
good for something this then I mean yeah
you'll need USB C dongles for your well
most of what you own but they both
charge the device giving you the option
to plug into either side and it also
includes a headphone jack which is no
longer a given on pixel devices spec
wise are config is pretty much perfect
for web browsing and light productivity
it's a core i5 dual core with eight gigs
of ram and a 256 gig SSD but you can get
it with up to a core i7 and 512 gigs of
nvme solid-state storage and the quality
of the hardware extends to the glass-top
trackpad which has an excellent feel and
after a bit of sensitivity tuning is
actually pretty close to macbook level
good and the keyboard which is solidly
built with a light crisp feel to the
switches that I really enjoyed I was
easily able to get up to speed and
typing on it would be amazing except for
three things one the lack of a dedicated
Delete key and home and end keys can be
worked around with alt backspace and
this hand eerie mapper tool but are
still annoying emissions to while the
rubber wrist rest material feels nice it
is easy for the heel of your hand to end
up on the corner between the rubber and
the aluminum making it uncomfortable
after a pretty short time and three the
inclusion of a Google assistant button
seems pretty cool in theory but unless
you operate a keyboard and trackpad
pretty slowly voice recognition might
not be faster for a lot of things so I'd
have personally preferred a function key
with secondary functionality for some of
the other
the pixel book has a Productivity
oriented 3x2 aspect ratio IPS display
with a bright backlight and vibrant
colors
it's 2400 by 1600 resolution gives you
nice sharp text and there's lots of room
for vertical scrolling content in your
web browser which is good because it
basically runs a web browser and there
are great big bezels that give it a bit
of a 2016 rather than 2017 look but I
understand why they're there since you
got to put your finger somewhere in
tablet mode which I guess brings us
perfectly to tablet mode it's a tablet I
guess but like not as good as a regular
one so anything that you would do in the
Chrome browser on your Android tablet is
fine but while theoretically you can
install android apps on Chrome OS a lot
of the ones that we installed had issues
ranging from not rescaling correctly for
the display to just not working at all
so we'd strongly recommend an Android
tablet if you want to install Android
apps and it'll run Chrome - and
furthermore this one might seem like a
pretty petty complaint but the included
touch keyboards issues made the tablet
experience markedly worse like why would
I ever want to type like this the shift
key inexplicably defaults to some stupid
Jaden Smith capitalize all the first
letters mode and why would I want two
spaces when I go back and change a word
I assumed that it would just be the same
Google keyboard as Android but it's not
and making matters worse at this time
third-party keyboards like SwiftKey
aren't supported and I mean while we're
at it the camera is a bit of a
disappointment - I mean it's not
unusable but I was expecting something
in line with the front shooter on the
pixel - for you know crystal-clear video
calls isn't that the whole pixel
branding instead what I got was a very
soft image some exposure issues and an
included app that doesn't support
recording video we had to do this
through
some janky website it also lacks cool
features like face recognition like
Windows hello or a fingerprint scanner
for easy unlocking though if you have a
supported Android phone you can use that
to unlock it instead unless like me you
find it faster to just type in your
password than to pull something out of
your pocket and the frustrations just
keep coming and this script had to be
written in Google Docs because our
template for word crashes office online
for some reason on this device file
system navigation feels like an
afterthought there's no back or
upper-level buttons the hardware back
key doesn't work and copy pasting our
network drive wouldn't work the display
scaling is weird and doesn't actually
report useful things like the resolution
or scaling percentage honestly that the
rest of this video could easily be just
a boring list of other nitpicky things
that I think will wear on you the same
way they did on us every time you try
and be legitimately productive on your
pixel book so I won't bore you with that
instead I want to talk about the
possibility then of using a different OS
on this device to address them because
the hardware is dope
as the kids say Windows is locked out at
a BIOS level so no luck there but I
found this great life hacker tutorial
for some kind of kick-ass Linux
switching functionality where you can
actually have both OSS booted even and
then just switch between them and it
works this is sort of so you switch by
hitting ctrl shift alt back so we're
good so far but then in Linux the
trackpad socks and because of the high
resolution display the icons are super
small with at least in this distro
fairly limited scaling options so with
this guide for free by the way you've
got the option then of a polished but
somewhat kneecapped experience or a kind
of broken or requires a lot of tweaking
Linux experienced that at least lets you
do whatever you want what
would be pretty cool on a $200
Chromebook the issue I have then is that
for 1200 u.s. dollars you could have a
surface laptop a MacBook Air a think pad
of razor blades stealth I don't know any
number of things that come with a real
operating system
so overall the pixel book is a sexy
piece of hardware and my opinion design
that is unfortunately let down by an OS
that just isn't versatile enough to
justify the price tag we love Google
around here and we think that they're
doing a lot of cool things right now but
this just isn't one of them speaking of
cool things though Squarespace
Squarespace has 24/7 support via live
chat and email so if you've been
thinking to yourself gee I'd love to set
up a website but it looks kind of
complicated give it a try
they've got a free trial for 14 days and
then after that it is just 12 bucks a
month and the whole website creation
process is cloud-based so you take one
of their gorgeous templates that will
scale great across any device be it a
desktop a Chromebook a phone whatever
the case may be you plunk in your photos
you plunk in your text you uh you know
use their logo designer to make a
cool-looking logo you create a blog that
you can publish content in in Apple news
format making it available to millions
of potential readers and oh yeah they've
got a store module included with every
Squarespace site and it's off to the
races
