hundred and twenty eight gigabytes of
unbuffered ddr4 memory and put it into a
gaming motherboard this time we're gonna
cram as much RAM as possible into a
gigabyte bricks with some help from our
friends at intelligent memory and on the
subject of intelligent is it a good idea
to run a computer inside a mini-fridge
should I sacrifice the mini-fridge in
the garage at our office to find out
smash that like button if you want to
see it happen
the Kingston Casey 310 series SSDs we're
using in our high-speed storage server
feature firmware based power Blas
protection rock-solid performance and
large capacities up to 960 gigs click
right here to learn more so this video
is actually pretty straight forward from
a mechanical standpoint just like any
Intel nook or Brix mini PC this Brix is
an ultra compact PC kit specifically
it's the BX of I 3 H - 5 0 1 0 it comes
with a case motherboard external power
supply Wi-Fi module and the core i3 CPU
it's got 4 USB 3.0 ports HDMI and mini
DisplayPort outputs an audio jack
Ethernet power in and it's super small
and kind of cute
so as usual it's what's inside that
counts and there's a fair bit of neat
stuff going on in here number one this
is on the leading edge of Broadwell
based pcs the core i3 50 10 you inside
it is built on Intel's latest 14
nanometer process note making it pretty
much a Core M like in the new MacBook
that we reviewed here but with higher
clock speeds and higher power targets
since it'll be plugged into the wall and
it'll be actively cooled but until made
other improvements to performance on the
CPU and GPU was increased over as well
and power consumption was dropped 30%
but not all of the improvements made it
into the marketing decks and intelligent
memory clued us in that on compatible
Broadwell based systems it would
actually be possible to achieve higher
than the official 16 gigs of rated
memory capacity support although this
shouldn't come as too much of a surprise
since these are the same pranksters that
sent us a hundred and twenty eight gigs
of ddr3 to test the benefits of over a
hundred gigs of memory in Ed's ELLs
workstation nearly a year ago so here
they are the creatively named
intelligent memory 16 gig ddr3l memory
modules rated at 1333 mega Hertz speeds
at 1.35 or 1.5 volts and packed up in a
sodium four factor
for your ultra-compact PC or laptop
convenience installing them was as
simple as any memory you pop open the
brics slot in the two sticks the way you
normally would although you'll need a
storage drive if you want to actually
boot up the system as well since this is
a bare-bones PC and fire it up
everything showed up
sort of normally with cpu-z not giving
as detailed a report on the modules as
normal but Windows detecting and using
everything just fine and even passing a
torture test SEC a 32 gigs of ram in the
palm of your hand but all is not
completely rosy while are on the side
gt72 gaming notebook which is actually
right here this also features a broad
well based cpu and also managed to
detect the modules in the BIOS and even
in Windows it reported only 32 gigs of
our 48 gigs of ram as usable so if you
want to avoid running into a similar
situation where you get can't actually
utilize all your shiny new memory make
sure you consult the official supported
list from intelligent memory since
notebook maker support for this actually
along with Intel's support for this is
on official speaking of support teen.com
if you call those guys you actually
talked to a person instead of being put
through an automated menu and they've
got a different approach to mobile
billing as well it's a pay for what you
use model versus the buffet model where
you have to kind of like imagine a
buffet where you had to walk in and list
like an itemized list of all the things
you were gonna eat and then if you don't
end up eating that stuff you have to pay
for it anyway well that kind of sucks no
ting is more like the traditional buffet
you use and pay for only exactly what
you eat except you don't even have to
commit to like you know if yeah I just
want a salad but like the buffet salad
looks pretty good you don't actually
have to spend the $16.95 your
cancellation fee up to $75 and if all
that sounds pretty good then if you head
over to our link Linus ENCOM you can
save another
$25.00 in service credit or towards a
new device so if you want to know if
things gonna work for you because you
know hey well it's pay-as-you-go but how
much do you have to pay head over to
line of steam calm and try out the
savings calculator enter your last few
bills and enter your last little bit of
usage and find out if ting will save you
money thanks for watching guys that this
video sucked I think you know what to do
but if it was awesome not 32 gigs I've
written here

through the community forum now that
you're done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so
click that little I in the top right
corner to check out oh this is a good
one to check out our video where we take
the fury X and we put it head-to-head
against the gtx 980ti and a little tiny
pc and see which one performs better
small computers they're kind of a fetish
