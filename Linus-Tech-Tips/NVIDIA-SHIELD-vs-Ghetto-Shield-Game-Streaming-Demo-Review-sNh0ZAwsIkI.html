ready for anything click now to learn
more welcome to my full review of
invidious shield handheld gaming device
now it's not going to be a full review
in the sense that I compared the battery
life to other smartphones and tablets or
you know give you empirical numbers on
how the GPU performs this is more of a
hands-on review as well as a direct
comparison to the ghetto shield which
was an Xbox 360 controller bolted to a
smartphone running Splashtop in order to
simulate the shield gaming experience
where you can run PC games over Wireless
to your handheld device let's start with
the overall usage experience so first
things first
it feels extremely solid in your hands
if anything I'd say maybe a bit too
solid it can be quite heavy if you're
sitting with it in your lap or if you're
laying on your stomach playing with it
then you're you're not going to have any
problems but if you're laying on your
back holding it above your head and
trying to play with it that way then you
might run into a little bit of
difficulty with your with your arms
getting fatigued after you know 5 or 10
minutes you might have to shift a little
bit with that said it really doesn't
feel like they added the extra weight
for no apparent reason because it's got
a nice beefy battery in it you don't
really feel like oh the battery in this
thing sucks I'm playing with it and I'm
running out of battery you know what
happens is you play with it you plug it
in and it'll be ready to go next time
around with that set yeah if you're not
using the stock charger which is a 2.1
amp charger you're going to be wasting
your time the 1 amp charger doesn't even
charge this device fast enough to keep
it charging while you're playing an
android game on it so make sure you're
using the default charger it is a nice
compact 2.1 amp charger so that's
definitely a plus in terms of ergonomics
I found that with my hands it seems like
it's designed for someone with slightly
bigger hands than me I do have really
small hands I wear like women's small
motorcycle gloves but I was able to
reach the ABXY buttons and the d-pad
without any difficulty without shifting
at all the joysticks are they're a bit
of a stretch for me but I can I can
in all directions without without too
much of a challenge I don't stand a
chance of reaching any of these middle
buttons without shifting and actually at
the back the shoulder buttons as well as
the triggers were fine as well I didn't
notice any heat that really bothered me
so nothing really transferred through
the gamepad itself and the exhaust bent
on the back moves the heat away from
your hands in fact it's a little bit
warm right now but really nothing
unbearable
it's got mini-hdmi as well as charging
and a headphone microphone combo Jack if
you're not already familiar with the way
that shield works and as far as the
ergonomics are as well as far as the
design of the gamepad itself goes it's
excellent the buttons here have a great
tactile response the joysticks feel
really good the one exception is the
d-pad which is kind of poopy it's fine
for something like oh you know weapon
switching or you know functionality
that's not critical whereas if you were
you know doing a platforming on it yeah
yeah it's it's really really not that
special the speakers are excellent
though so it's loud enough that you can
easily use it in an environment where
there's a fair bit of ambient noise and
the screen is nice and IPS has great
viewing angles and looks outstanding
it's also got a great range of
brightness and running of running a
stock Android device was really
refreshing for me because I've run in
HTC One which is using Sense and I've
never actually used a stock Android
device before so there you go that's my
impressions overall the shield I don't
really see myself using the whole tag
thing here but you can if you want also
oh yes this is an accessory that I sort
of recommend picking up this is their
carry case which has a nice hard shell
to it so it's going to protect it if
you're traveling around with it it's got
a little you know plug at the back that
allows you to charge the device even
when it's inside comes with a little
wrist strap and the overall feel is is
very rugged there's a little carrying
pouch is up here on the top the one
reason why I wouldn't recommend picking
it up because otherwise I really really
would it's quite nice is that I didn't
find myself traveling with shield much
by the time you've got the case and the
shield it's quite bulky and quite heavy
so I found myself using it at home more
than out and about when I was out and
about those kind of cool because you get
some you get kind of a couple double
takes as I call what is he playing on I
personally do believe that devices like
this are the future of mobile gaming
with an open platform versus you know oh
well when we decide to release a new
console there will be a whole new slew
of games we will really release
everything or we won't release
everything and you will like it
I mean having something that behaves
more like a PC where we can get hardware
upgrades as they come we can play the
entire back library of games and expect
new games to come this is the future but
right now the game library is relatively
small however that brings us to the game
streaming experience invidious hole
claim to fame with this device other
than the fact that you can run any
Android game pretty much I was running
GTA vice sity on it which has a lot of
warnings when you install it oh don't
run anything else at the same time turn
the graphic details down if it's not
running correctly around like a dream on
this thing no difficulty whatsoever it's
my first time playing it too so it's
been a fair bit of time on that but
anyway the game streaming is how they
are planning to augment the slightly
smaller subset of Android games that do
have full controller support and will
work just fine and in my experience man
is it awesome now we did do the whole
ghetto shield thing where we were using
Splashtop and we did show that it can be
done but I think what you guys are going
to see with some of the slow motion
footage I'm going to be showing you is
that Nvidia shield really does deliver a
nearly latency free experience so we
took this slow-motion footage at 480
frames per second which means if you
really felt like it you could slow down
the footage and you could find out
exactly how many milliseconds of extra
delay the wireless connection is adding
but what's really going to stand out
more than anything else is how close it
is to the gaming grade 120 Hertz monitor
behind it and now we're going to shift
over to our ghetto shield with Splashtop
that not only is not running as high
resolution so it's 640 by 480 instead of
1280 by 720 although it still looks
great on a foreign 4.7 inch screen like
let's be really clear about that it
still looks fine so it's lower
resolution you obviously get less
battery life because you're using your
phone you obviously have to like bolt it
to something in order to have it be a
great experience and there's all these
things
but the latency is not even close we
found we could play games with the
ghetto shield but it's easy to play
games with the proper shield not only
that but the experience of getting
shield running is much more seamless
with the ghetto shield you have to
manually configure your desktop
resolution it'll only work with games
that are able to run in full-screen
windowed mode and there's a bunch of
caveats like that with the shield you
press the big Nvidia button in the
middle which brings up your tiger
optimized games your shield store and
AHA your PC games it launches Steam it
changes the resolution for you gives you
a bunch of clues as to what gestures you
can use and then boom it gives you a
games list so we use Borderlands 2 and
Crysis to validate that things were
working correctly crisis was the one
that being an older title it streamed
great it looked great but you can really
tell the HUD elements aren't optimized
for it there's a lot of key bindings
that are designed for mouse and keyboard
so there wasn't really a corresponding
button that made any sense it's not so
yeah so it wasn't perfect but it looked
great and it was very playable not
having auto aim when you're relying on
using a controller is definitely a
disadvantage but Borderlands 2 was a
fantastic experience and this I think
really makes my point about how well how
the experience differs from something
where you're manually setting things up
every time you can be anywhere in your
house and running this and not really
thinking about what's going on in your
PC and if someone happens to be on it it
should be noted that your PC does
display video while you're gaming on the
shield but it doesn't play audio so it
only pushes audio to the shield instead
of just your speaker's being blaring
anytime you're anywhere else in your
house gaming on the device
now wireless you can't just use any old
run-of-the-mill 29.99 best buy special
wireless router it's not going to work
you want to get a decent wireless router
you can check out the list of
recommended ones on NVIDIA comm we found
that there were routers that worked just
fine even from a floor away such as the
EA 4500 that was not on the list but you
need a strong concurrent dual band
router so that is 2.4 gigahertz and 5
gigahertz at the same time because the
wireless solution on the Nvidia shield
is excellent and that's part of what
makes the technology work so well
so I think that pretty much wraps it up
for everything I wanted to say about it
is it a recommended buy at 299 hard to
say because much like any other console
it depends on the game library so if you
look at that Android library and you go
yeah sure that's worth it to me I'm game
then great that's that's perfect for you
if you look at that library you go
that's not good enough
but oh I have a PC library that I can
use to augment it I think I'll use this
a lot around my house then then that
might be good enough for you too if you
don't have an Android device at all I
actually found I'd used it a lot just
for watching videos on Netflix or even
replying to emails when I'm just out and
about and it happened to be the closest
thing to me I mean the touch screen is
excellent there are some there are a few
sort of UI things that are weird like
apps that are expecting to be running on
a phone when they're running on a low
resolution device and are optimized for
portrait and don't really switch to
landscape very well some of those were
kind of funny I'm like using it like
this but overall it was it was a good
usage experience other than other than
that UI weirdness would I recommend it
for 300 you know what it's your call but
I understand why it costs 300 it has the
latest tiger 4 processor which is
extremely fast it really does feel like
a very buttery smooth Android experience
everything you're doing whether it's
graphics or the CPU itself and you look
at how much something like the phone
costs this is everything a phone is and
more in some ways except it doesn't
happen to have a wireless connection for
mobile data that's the only real
difference here you know like no camera
on the back and stuff like that but
there's a lot of engineering that went
into building this thing and it's
expensive to make I think 300 is
reasonable in terms of the hardware and
I think I've rambled quite enough leave
a like if you liked this video leave a
dislike if you disliked it and leave a
comment let me know do you think the
future of mobile gaming is portable
devices like this that are run on an
open platform even if maybe Nvidia
shield isn't the one maybe it's
something that's a little bit more
pocketable I don't know you tell me</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
