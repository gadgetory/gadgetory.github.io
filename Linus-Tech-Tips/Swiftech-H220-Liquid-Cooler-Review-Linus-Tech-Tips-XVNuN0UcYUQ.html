promo calm welcome to my full product
overview of the swift tech age 220
liquid cooler so this is an all-in-one
liquid cooling kit sort of because
unlike the other ones out there it is
fully expandable and uses
high-performance components so by
high-performance components I mean a
swift tech designed baseplate I mean a
high powered pump that is capable of
running multiple radiators multiple
blocks 3/8 inch tubing that can be
replaced and upgraded and added to and a
copper fin radiator rather than the
aluminum fin radiators that competitors
are using it also comes with Swift X
helix fans pre attached so installation
is a snap you basically just take the
thing and then screw some fans into your
dual 120 millimeter mount and you are
pretty much ready to go
upgrades and maintenance can be
performed via the fill port here on the
radiator itself so that acts as a
reservoir while the pump is built into
the CPU block so if tech does a great
job with their mounting mechanisms as
always so it comes pre pre ready for you
although we've taken it off now at this
point because we've tested it and it
comes with screws for LGA 2011 to go
directly into the backplate on your
motherboard as well as a backplate and
additional mounting screws for the other
Intel sockets you even get an AMD
bracket included yeah and it's not like
a cheesy AMD bracket that's sort of
weird compared to everything else so
there's been a lot of hubbub about the
h2 20 which is why we're releasing this
review a little bit out of order we
filmed some other ones already but we
want to get this one out to you guys how
does it actually perform so let's start
with introducing our standard test bench
and methodology so we have a coarse RC
70 case that we close up all the side
panels on and then we measure ambient
temperature using our thermometer at the
intake so that gives us a good idea of
what the room temperature
are like well not a good idea an exact
idea of what the room temperatures are
like we use a GTX 580 to generate a heat
load because we don't want to give the
CPU cooler any unnecessary advantages
that it would get on an open test
platform this is a pretending this is a
real case with a real gaming rig inside
which means there's other heat
generating components so we run this
with combustor for our load test and
then we leave it idle for our idle test
we have a 3930k CPU we've chosen that
for a number of reasons Intel really is
the platform of choice for most
enthusiasts out there right now and the
fact that it's a six core processor
means that it generates oh yeah
overclocked
to means that it generates a ton of heat
load and allows us to really
differentiate the coolers for you guys
so you know which ones are genuinely
better we use IC Diamond thermal
compound on all the coolers to eliminate
as many variables as we can and also in
the spirit of variable elimination we
test all coolers with Noctua n ff12 fans
using their seven volt adapters the
reason for this is that we were able to
get the system to a noise level that we
feel is appropriate so you can actually
listen to it there's look that is a
quiet gaming rig and then we know how
add a noise level that we appreciate
that cooler will actually perform so
let's move along to sort of the
performance numbers here which is right
here so our idle temperatures I have no
idea what you're talking about
oh yeah there's a boom mic on the camera
that slick stuck the camera into the
case - thank you yeah okay so idle temps
this week because we were curious how
Swift text helix fans performed because
we've never really used them before we
decided to run the Swift deck age 220 at
full pump speed with the stock fans to
see how performed it was right in there
with an air cooler and some single 120
millimeter and single 90 millimeter
radiators so we were a little concerned
about that however when we ran it with n
FF 12s we've got some of the best idle
temperatures that we've ever seen even
when we turn the pump down to a fraction
of its full speed making
near-silent the pump was a little bit on
the loud smoke the pump was loud when it
was running at full speed but the good
news is you don't have to now let's head
into low temperatures so when we say
correct it 220 degrees the reason we say
that is because we run all of our fans
at a fixed rpm so basically if the room
temperature goes up five degrees the CPU
temperature will go up exactly five
degrees if you want to know how our
setups going to perform where you live
measure your room temperature and then
just add or minus two so so this is sort
of standard room temperature now into
the juicy low temperature results guys
so the first thing we noticed about the
low temperatures was the H 220 at full
speed with the stock fans was among the
least performing of the coolers that
we've tested in the past right down
there with you know single 120
millimeter radiator coolers and even our
Silver Arrow Xtreme air cooler so that
was that was very disappointing it was
also quite loud with the pump at full
speed so what we didn't necessarily
realize at the time was the H 220 needs
a little bit of TLC and optimization and
once you do that it destroys everything
else so with full pump speed again the
pump speed was yeah full pump speed was
a little on the loud side for our taste
but a lot of people probably wouldn't
care it was the best performing cooler
on our test bed by a significant margin
we attribute this to the copper radiator
as well as the much much better CPU
block that Swift tech integrates I mean
a CPU block can make a 5 degree
difference and then a copper radiator
versus an aluminum radiator is worth a
couple degrees as well there so that's
very exciting to see and we were even
more excited to see that when we turned
the pump down it was still our top
performing cooler by a good 4 degree
margin so we can explain the rest of the
results pretty easily as well the water
2.0 has a thicker radiator than the H
100 I which is why it performs better
even though it's a dual 120 the H 110
uses a dual 140 millimeter rad so that's
why that performs better than an H 100 I
and H 100 is pretty standard it performs
about the same as the as you know any
other dual 120 millimeter radiator
cooler a touch
plus you get course their link software
and I think that pretty much covers it
so in conclusion the age to 20 if you
make the correct optimizations which is
to turn down the pump which is easy you
can use your motherboard pump control
CPU fan control utility to just turn
that baby down and if you get some
awesome fans to put on it in our case
nff twelves from Noctua which are
freaking awesome
it is far and away the best pre-done
liquid cooler that you can put on your
cpu and it has the advantage of actually
being able to be expanded with multiple
blocks when you're ready for it in the
future thanks for checking out this
video on - tech tips what oh the - blow
yeah okay slick wanted me to mention
that the stock tube length is a little
bit on the long side and he's right if
you come look at it they're they're
pretty long I mean the good news is it
well it doesn't even look that long when
you put it on this side but you had on
the other side before and that was a bit
of like they were sticking out so like
that the good news about those tubes
though is it's as simple as cutting them
putting them back together and you can
have exactly the length you need so I
would rather Swift tack where you can
actually adjust it err on the side of
tubes that are too long than err on the
side of tubes that are not long enough
