and this is gonna be pretty quick
because I already did the core i3 540
but this is the core i3 530 so this one
runs at 2.9 3 gigahertz it has
hyper-threading but no turbo boost
functionality much like the other core
i3 processors that are available for a
processor the 540 now the core i3
processors what is so unique about them
as I did mention in the other unboxing
is that they do include an onboard
graphics chip so if you use this in
conjunction with an H 55 motherboard or
H 57 when those are finally available
you will be able to take advantage of
the onboard graphics including hdmi out
DVI out some of them even have
DisplayPort out which is kind of cool so
the first thing you'll find in the box
is your core i3 processor installation
instructions your 3or warranty
information as well as your stickers
shut for some reason as well as your
Intel Core i3 case sticker very cool and
then the next thing you will find is
nothing else in the box this is a
plastic clamshell which includes your
CPU which we'll have a look at in just a
moment as well as an incredibly weak
looking CPU cooler I mean it really does
speak for one thing to how little heat
output that you see from the core i3
processors but if you look that like
it's not much thicker than my finger is
wide actually here if I hold that up a
front there you can get a better
perspective on it so there's not a whole
lot of metal involved there's no copper
core on this cooler it does come with
pre applied thermal compound so if you
are just buying the chip and you just
can use this not cool you just plonk
that right on this will spread itself
out from the mounting pressure and I
really do recommend especially if you're
gonna be I'm actually okay if you're
overclocking these chips by a different
cooler if you're not overclocking them
you can use it with this one but it's
not going to be the quietest it's not
gonna be the coolest etc etc so here's
the core i3 530 itself this is the
lowest end core i3 as of the time of
doing this unboxing but there is a
Pentium dual core variant available but
I wouldn't really recommend that one
because the core i3 is really do offer a
great price to performance ratio this is
an LGA 1156 chip so you can see there
are 1156
ads on the back of this processor which
make contact with your motherboard it's
supported by all of the age 55 P 55 and
age 57 boards like I said when those are
available on the market at this time and
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the core i3 530</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
