meeting now no one's buying AMD laptops
because they're slow but everyone likes
AMD rise in desktops with lots of
processing cores today's video is
brought to you by Coursera they're void
Pro gaming headsets feature microfiber
mesh fabric and memory foam ear cups as
well as custom tuned 50 millimeter
neodymium drivers check them out through
the links below
with its black back panel and red accent
lighting the asus GL 702 zc looks mean
but not in an over-the-top gamer ii way
and opening it up immediately reveals
the stars of the show a risin 7 CPU and
Radeon graphics processor that make this
the first all AMD gaming notebook that
we've seen in many years or not I think
of it ever and it's no slouch the Rison
7 1708 core 16 thread processor boosts
to up to 3.7 gigahertz the RX 580 is a
very competent GPU for 1080p gaming the
16 gigs of ram out of the box and the
ample i/o that comes with the territory
of a large and in charge 17 inch machine
like this one make the GL 702 ZC on
paper one of the most compelling gaming
/ workstation pcs that we've ever seen
but I'm sure what everyone is wondering
right now is can they keep all of that
cool and the answer is hell yeah for a
while at three points you gigahertz
under synthetic load the temps well they
just kept on rising at five minutes we
hit 80 degrees Celsius after a 10 we
were above 90 and then after 20 minutes
it seemed to level off but at 95 degrees
and while still remaining super quiet
for some reason maybe a soos needs to do
some fan curve tuning here once my CPU
is over 90 degrees I don't care if it
sounds like a typhoon
it needs some TLC tender love and
cooling and remember our testing was
done in a climate-controlled room all of
that being said we were impressed to see
any laptop maintain 3.2 gigahertz on
eight cores so to find out how this kind
of grunt compares to a more traditional
intel 4 core laptop we put it up against
the asus g 503 vm
a similarly priced 15-inch er that packs
an Intel Core i7 7700 HQ and in an
NVIDIA GTX 1060 firing up Cinebench weak
wow oh wow just wow that's some savage
destruction of I mean not just our
comparison laptop all laptops buy a lot
even beasts like a Seuss's $6,000
water-cooled GX 800 and the Acer
predator 21 X are no match for the
multi-threaded prowess of the GL 702 ZC
and the theme continues in other CPU
focused tests like 7-zip and blender
it's not all amazing though in rendering
tasks that can take advantage of the GPU
the gap narrows somewhat with the GL 702
ZC still taking a convincing lead though
and then when we move from compute to
graphics the RX 580 just can't quite
keep up with the gtx 1060 no matter how
hard it tries which judging by the sound
of the fans while gaming was pretty hard
in 3d market loses out by a bit to the
1060 and then in actual games the GL 702
GC consistently loses although not by
much to its smaller green and blue
brother not that those couple of frames
will probably be noticeable in actual
gameplay but there's more to life than
FPS anyway if you run out and buy a GL
702 CC today
that's our AMD version here it's both
heavier and thicker than the Intel
Nvidia version and honestly the 702
didn't light any exciting fires for us
at this price in general the keyboard is
not amazing it does have a numpad if
you're into that and after typing for a
bit
getting up to speed accurately won't be
a big challenge but it's a bit mushy
feeling and pretty much the same can be
said for the trackpad it's serviceable
but an interesting and the same goes for
the screen it is IPS so viewing angles
brightness and colors were all suitably
adequate and free sync is a boon for
improved gaming smoothness at low frame
rates by
sixty Hertz creams are better suited for
laptops that don't have to go up against
120 Hertz models at a similar price in
eSports titles this amounts to a big
difference in the gaming experience
moving on to the webcam it's not bad by
laptop standards but it's unexceptional
especially in low light and you might
want the light low since you'll be doing
everything you can to conserve the
battery like there's bad and then
there's one hour and 22 minutes until
all the electrons have escaped bad to be
clear the performance while it's doing
it is good but this still puts the 702
ZC on the worst battery life we've ever
seen in PC Mark's test podium okay so
that last bit was a bit of a downer
there's more good stuff though opening
up the GL 702 ZC you are greeted with
surprising upgrade ability there's an
empty RAM slot non soldered solid state
storage and a two and a half inch Bay
and and a mother-freaking full sized
desktop a m4 socket now we can't
guarantee that a soos will provide BIOS
updates but AMD has confirmed a m4
support until 2020 so it's possible
pretty unlikely but possible that you
could have top-tier AMD CPU performance
for years to come with all that being
said we're not that into buying this
thing as a gaming laptop its competent
at gaming but if that's what you plan on
doing there are better options right now
with that said we see the GL 702 ZC with
its unprecedented multi-threaded
performance as more of a powerhouse on a
budget mobile workstation that can also
game on the side and in time we're
really excited to see what other rise in
seven designs make their way to the
market
I mean maybe with a more powerful NVIDIA
GPU or mobile Vega next note AMD we
could see the ultimate
reaming laptop only time will tell
speaking of time if you find yourself
running your small business or your
freelance operation and just not having
enough of it fresh books can be the
solution you're looking for it's a
cloud-based accounting software that
