him stuck I actually don't know but all
I know is piss my Wi-Fi sounds an awful
lot like get my wife and that is not the
same thing
so this be my neighbor John's house okay
I'll stop talking like that that's awful
John runs a home business making sports
scoreboards that are both affordable to
purchase and operate thanks to their
battery-backed solar-powered design and
they also operate in all weather
conditions this is Canada after all
radio control oh yeah that's it my score
boards are designed built and assembled
right here in Canada the microcontroller
chip that runs the whole system is again
designed and programmed by me I've
written the software to do this the
printed circuit boards are again
designed by me electronics and so on the
PC boards themselves are built in
Richmond BC they're sent back to me as a
blank board I assemble the components in
it and test it right here then once all
that's done and tested and everything's
okay I build and assemble the coils
right here again in the shop well that's
great John but what I couldn't help
noticing when we were working on that
homemade CPU waterblock that let me
cheat in scrap yard war season two is
how horribly out-of-date some of your
gear was I mean an Athlon 64 PC running
your C&amp;amp;C
USB drives to transfer files from one
computer to another are you still using
this computer the entire business's
backups
are on a single hard drive and are you
still using the ISP provided wireless
access point with the name Telus 1995 I
didn't think anyone had done that since
1995 no no I'm afraid I'll need to
reject this reality and substitute my
own
which is why we're here over a year
later and Ubiquiti Networks the makers
of the access point I ended up buying in
sim Lim square in Pitt my wife is owed
one has agreed to sponsor a full tech
makeover for my neighbor John even going
as far as to send out one of their
technicians to make sure everything's
running
any okay super hunky-dory and paying for
us to have mark the contractor help us
with anything that might involve power
tools so let's get crack-a-lackin' let's
run through the rationale behind the
gear we're using our unified security
gateway Pro is essentially a router that
can be managed from the unified
controller it handles our packet
processing and DHCP our unify switch
eight handles both active and passive
Power over Ethernet with enough ports
for all of the devices we have on site
our unify ap pro wireless access points
are designed to handle a much higher
client load but our deployment here is
more about killer 802.11 AC coverage so
that dropped Skype calls are a thing of
the past
and the unified cloud key is the
low-power Linux computer on a stick that
manages all these other network devices
to keep them working perfectly
okay so obviously this has got to go
there's this is a single access point
it's up in the corner of the house I
think I have better reception from my
house then John has in certain areas in
his house so here's what I'm thinking in
terms of getting full coverage in this
place with I had planned for three
access points so I wanted one up here
for wife approval factor and that will
mostly service the soundscape
entertainment sound recording studio in
there and one of the kids bedrooms
because there will be a hard line in the
master bedroom for the computer that
they operate there so if we have
slightly less reception to the master
then it's not the end of the world I
wanted to put it here the wife gig that
gives that feel absolutely no way ok so
that'll probably do the upstairs right
look connected ok should easily go video
do ok for the downstairs to keep cabling
simple I wanted to have the access point
in the garage which is just on the other
side of this wall so that means great
strength for that where the business is
operating that should cover this living
room area really well now we've got one
two three walls between it and the den
however
we want to bring one more out of the
crawlspace and put it here to cover the
backyard and then I'm thinking hopefully
the back half of the bottom floor oh
yeah so the cable runs that those
gentlemen are getting going up there are
all going to come down to this corner
behind me where we're going to have
ubiquity xej router light we're going to
have one of their p OE switches so that
we don't have to run additional power to
all of our access points we're going to
have a proper Nazz with real-time
redundancy and finally we're going to
have one of their little controller
doodads that makes it so we don't have
to have a dedicated PC to handle
seamless handoff from access point to
access point while clients are roaming
around the house so the great thing
about any tech project is you don't have
to create drama like you do with a lot
of reality shows the plan was to have an
ADSL line down here so we could move our
networking stuff downstairs and run
everything out from there into the crawl
space but we actually don't know if
either of these phone lines are live
okay so I'm going up to see if I can
find out where those cables terminate so
I got to go I don't know what about 10
feet over that way okay oh ow my head oh
crap there's a okay there's not a clear
path there's there's a kind of a wall
here like a look not kind of a well
there's literally a wall so give me a
moment try not to fall through the
ceiling pull what we call a Dennis here
you know what no I think I got him I
think I got and I think I see yeah I
think I see what's going on here so it
looks like only two are connected
two of the wire pairs on the base cables
yeah okay so that would explain it cuz
you need four pairs for voice and data
okay cool
so all the other news lines connect them
then right there we go
okay so that's how that goes over to
that corner one of them is actually in
this this guy so one of them has let me
have a look at yeah that's that's it
hold on this one coming in here so that
one looks like it has he wires older
installations they didn't actually have
to use like a go by the actual standard
color coding so you could get one color
that in place but it's actually has
another purpose great well I can tell
you right now these colors look to be
kind of random because the red and the
green are not connected to red and green
on the other side I don't think okay so
what I just need to go up there with a
roll of electrical tape and twist them
together no it's that idea it might work
but that's apparently what was done in
the first place yes I do see that I
can't go to be how reliable that would
be if we're data if it did work well it
stopped working so about that reliable
yes we can certainly try out and see
what happens we can try it and see if it
works immediately now this and then we
can twist some caps on it and make sure
it doesn't go anywhere at that point so
do you want me to go back up there and
start twisting wires together sure we
can we can try that and the other thing
is if we had the I don't know how
accessible that room is he's running the
line to do the closet mm-hmm but there
won't be any easy way to get it down the
wall and out yeah I'm not really not
tidy anyways that white over yeah so
that's why we didn't want the the
networking closet upstairs some some
thought was given to this just not quite
enough just the Linus tech tips way
red to red green to green good so far
how it looks like the black came off
okay so this is an improvement over
before it's flashing faster now it's
doing anything
do we want solid hey good good aligned
okay all right my my ghetto pimp style
just twist them together I mean we'll
fix it but awesome that'll work for that
good one problem solid let's just wait
for the next one to happen so behind me
in progress we've got George leading the
charge on creating a custom enclosure
for that CNC mill that we used to create
the custom water block that should
dampen some of the noise that comes out
of it allowing John to have it running
during the night something that he
currently cannot do due to noise
regulations in this neighborhood so in
summary what George is going to be
building is a 2x4 construction shroud
that's going to allow for all the
existing functionality so easy access to
things like these drive bands here in
case they need to be replaced the
ability for the hose to continue to take
away the waste material while the
machine is working and most importantly
a complete enclosure with you know
baffles for exhaust vents to take away
as much of the noise as possible so
we've got half of our Ethernet run done
these are the ones for the master
bedroom as well as the closet upstairs
all that's left now is the one that goes
through the crawlspace out to the back
and a surprise one that goes over to
where the new ADSL line comes in to
where the networking closet is going to
be here in this corner so I actually
wouldn't mind getting in here to do the
actual PC upgrade mercifully the old one
has been apparently taken out back and
shot because it's not here anymore but
mike is currently working on just
getting all the latest firmware is
running on the security gateway the POV
switch and the cloud controller so I'm
going to go shopping so these are going
to run the CNC mill as well as the coil
winding machine and they say
be just much smaller ah quieter there's
no fans so they're less likely to
collect dust should be a better overall
solution not to mention faster I swear
if you want Windows Update to do
something be in a hurry all right let's
do this Bank
I'll take one of these actually no I'm
kidding I'll take a couple of the ve2
47s here one two
you
so we run into a small problem I just
kind of assumed we could get a monitor
arm at Best Buy
but Brandon looked it up and everything
is online only so I don't know where to
buy a monitor arm well try visions but
honestly I don't have a lot of hope for
this well then I will take them thank
you good sir this is a lot more than I
wanted to pay but these do look really
nice and these should work perfectly for
what we need and they had exactly two so
that just saved my bacon we now have
everything we need we're ready to head
back to the job site that's typical
right you go away for an hour cuz you
got to buy something you come back where
is everybody must be on lunch okay so
these are all programmed yes yeah okay
so why don't we go ahead and these ones
we'll deal with in the corner once
practice is done with his wiring up
there but why don't we go ahead and
install these things you're like whoo
all right let's do it
I got this I got this got this bro but I
might have to take off my pimp
sunglasses
cuz I can't see a damn thing it's
magnificent every head up okay he's
trying to get me to take off the Hat no
don't do it no I'm not taking off the
Hat taking off the Hat is the wrong
thing to do for any pimp pimp always
wears his hat oh I see okay alright your
make sense yeah okay so we're just
basically a two by four just a cup just
a small cup keep going until it starts
teeter-totter is pretty cool
yeah right now I can take the 2x4 right
here and we can slide it right on
excellent excellent
good good let's slow and easy boys now
you now Freightliner to front of you
another too late for my dicks in the
back there and we're going to slide it
on
on the edges here yeah yeah could we
have it might make our lives a little
bit easier if once we've got it up this
slides away John I'll awesome thank you
okay guys hold on oh yeah pulled it up
with it oh yeah I have let it down
straight down all we did in case okay
now we want to Center it yep your way
you're we just right there yeah take the
two by fours out we're good cut this guy
right now so okay yep yep and then we'll
lift this side and do the same because
when this is when this sucker is
spinning it vibrates quite a bit I like
it okay so while those guys finish up
the box for the C and C I'm going to go
ahead and get started on rolling out all
of the other gear that I have so I've
got the zotac PCs all loaded up with
fresh copies of Windows 10 wireless
mouse brand-new laptop it's a UX 303
from a sous as well as aa yes from our
friends over at Seagate and Synology
we've got a new Nass that is going to
have four terabytes of raid one storage
so time to get cracking on that so I'm
not sure a hundred percent exactly how
it works but it looks like yeah it looks
like it kind of clips in somehow and
then just slides on
so George and his guys have made about
three metric but tons of progress on the
enclosure over here check this out the
monitor arm is installed the keyboard
and mouse are on this gorgeous little
tray that Georgia stress tested so to
speak to make sure it's strong enough to
hold a keyboard and mouse and we've got
more progress over here in the corner
Mike over here has terminated most of
the ethernet jacks which means that
we're almost ready to switch between the
old network and the new one but first we
have to do the before of our before and
after test so in a nutshell we're going
around to four different locations
the workshop the upstairs audio room the
dining room here where I saw John using
his computer to have a VoIP call and the
poolside and we're doing four tests in
each location we're doing a file
transfer test we're using insider to see
what the actual signal strength is in
decibels and we're using that same
software to see how many overlapping
wireless networks there are in each of
those locations because the reality of
it is even if it's performing fine
right now in the middle of the day on a
Wednesday when everyone gets home and
they start streaming Netflix those 2.4
gigahertz networks that are nearby are
going to cause interference and hurt
John's networks performance that's one
of the reasons we're switching over to 5
gigahertz
so with all the before testing done all
that's really left now is for Mike to
finish up his Ethernet terminations and
for me to mount the last access point up
here in the corner of the garage slash
workshop uh yeah we're ready I've done
all my before tests okay so our server
closet is up and running we can access
either the unify cloud key configuration
which we shouldn't need to do because
Mike's gone ahead and set all that up or
we can access the unify controller which
is what is effectively running on that
so we're going to go ahead and manage
that and make sure that all of our ApS
are showing up that that is going to be
key here and there you have it three ApS
closet garage and outdoor and the next
step before we do our tests our
performance test is actually this is a
really cool feature you go into RF
environment and you can pick either 2.4
gigahertz or 5 gigahertz and do a scan
it takes about five minutes but this
kind of thing is worth it if you're
trying to avoid using the same channels
as everybody around you and you want the
best possible performance on your
network at all times I recommend doing a
scan like this during a time when your
neighbors are likely to be actually
using their internet so sometime around
7:00 to 9:00 p.m. in the evening so
we're finally done we've actually been
waiting a few weeks for some acoustic
panels for the inside of the C&amp;amp;C
enclosure but I am ready to present you
guys with our wireless signal strength
tests so by the poolside much much
stronger you can actually browse the
Internet at full speed from out there
whereas I couldn't even get a connection
to the old Wi-Fi access point from the
dining room table we're looking at an
improvement there as well same thing
here in the warehouse so wireless signal
strength has improved overall but that
wasn't the only thing we were doing here
we were improving the ergonomics of this
workstation which as you can tell has
definitely been dramatically improved
and second of all we were improving the
acoustics of this workstation so this
enclosure is now
pretty much done it still needs a little
bit more acoustic foam but we are ready
to do a before and after test and find
out if John's productivity can improve
thanks to being able to operate the CNC
at night so we're going to head outside
and do a before and after sound test
with the panel open versus having the
panel closed and see if we can hear the
difference all right John fire it up for
the before test
I don't know if he's going to be able to
hear me okay John close it down so I was
saying close the lid so it's pretty loud
not bad can the mic pick that up not bad
at all awesome alright so mission
accomplished thank you for checking out
the second ever episode of pimp my wife
I let me know what you guys would like
to see if we were to do a third episode
of this series see you guys later
you know it is that they walk</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
