video but this video is going to be
great we are going to be building a
computer inside a mini-fridge we are
going to answer the question once and
for all is it a good idea to build a
computer inside a mini-fridge like the
video if you think that's a good
question to answer I didn't have any
other teasers ready ok I need a key
Corsair delivers real mcaro here I have
one huh real nectar nothing with their
new strafe mechanical keyboard featuring
genuine German made Cherry MX key
switches click on munch in to learn more
I'm going to move much in now it's the
three for loop this may not look like a
computer case to you nor does it look
like a computer case to me because it's
not a computer case this is a fully
functional that is to say working but
not plugged in mini-fridge and if you're
like me and you've truly a forum you've
either witnessed or come up with the
idea on your own of building a computer
inside a mini-fridge where well hey it's
cold in there must be great for
overclocking right let's put it to the
test do you even lift bro yeah I lift
all right
urgh okay now before you go full-bore on
any kind of project you want to at least
validate the concept so we'll be taking
the zotac ZBOX pico pi3 20 and we will
be experimenting to find out if this
compact and power efficient passively
cooled PC can actually experience an
improvement in thermals and/or
performance inside the mini-fridge right
but of course first we have to establish
a baseline reading in our ambient
temperature test here so we're booting
up the Z box and then we're going to run
a stress test to find out just how she
runs before putting her inside the
fridge alright so we've got our baseline
numbers we're looking at anywhere from
about 46 to 49 degrees Celsius on our
course which puts us at about 22 to 25
degrees above our ambient temperature
which is about 27 degrees now let's go
ahead and fire up a stress test
what is that that's Pig it's my backpack
here oh shut up you got louder ah maybe
that's the low battery alert that is a
pretty aggressive low battery alert and
yet apparently that's what it was okay
so with that crummy experience out of
the way it looks like our CPU
temperatures have settled into 59 to 63
degrees and our ambient temperatures
actually touch higher at 27.5 okay so
what we'll find out now is whether our
fridge is even ready for us to put our
system inside it I'm supposed to be like
four degrees that's a touch hot oh well
then it is going down very fast okay
so let's go ahead and put this puppy on
the shelf and let's start it boom okay
so no real surprises here our idle
temperature test gives us anywhere from
25 to 27 degrees our ambient temperature
around the Pico is around five degrees
and that stands to reason because we're
looking at about a 20 degree Delta
between ambient and CPU temperature so
that means that at idle the mini-fridge
works it cools the Pico so this is the
part where the video gets really
interesting our fridges compressor is
running all the time but it is
maintaining a frosty internal
temperature as low as two to two and a
half degrees Celsius and our CPU has
settled in at around 38 to 40 degrees
Celsius under load the mini-fridge
concept is a massive success achieving a
C Wow
greater than 20 degree improvement in
load CPU temperatures now we're going to
take things up a notch I'm going to
steal Luke's test bed
and find out if the type of rig that you
would actually benefit from cooling down
for better overclock ability will
actually work in our mini-fridge setup
so this is a Titan X this is a 59 30 K
or 59 60 X not sure which 16 gigs of DDR
4 memory let's go
you'll never miss it actually he'll come
looking for me so now it's baseline time
with Luke's rig here in the garage so
our ambient temperatures are a little
cooler than yesterday but that's ok we
can correct for that the most important
thing is the difference between ambient
temperature and CPU temperature when
you're measuring this sort of thing and
our CPU temperature we're going to
simplify things a little bit instead of
looking at all the cores we're just
going to take the CPU reading and we're
looking at it's fluctuating between 29
and 30 degrees so now let's start the
stress test and see where we end up
outside of the cooling box we have our
numbers so the room cooled down a little
bit thanks to some breeziness at about
22 and a half degrees and our CPU
settled in just under 45 degrees on the
hottest of it's 6 cores it is a 59 30 K
I have now confirmed that so now it's
time let's do it go ahead and start by
removing some shelves I do not recommend
cooling down hard drives especially
while they are operating so we're not
going to be putting our hard drive in
there and another thing this Pico now
that it's cold and it's below ambient
temperature should not be powered on
until it reaches ambient temperature on
its own because otherwise condensation
can be a factor and any moisture with
powered on electronics is a terrible
idea
okay I think we've actually got enough
clearance on our fans here that they
should be able to cool the CPU just fine
that's a bit of a problem here I have a
solution yeah
there we go
problem solved so we're getting ambient
temperature readings the compressor is
running and we can see our idle CPU
temperatures here so let's find out
where she settles in at idle bear in
mind guys that we are talking a very
different level of heat load here I
think the Pico has a power supply that's
something like 10 watts total whereas
even at idle this computer is going to
consume somewhere in the neighborhood of
80 to 90 watts now I was really hoping I
was rooting for it I was hoping that the
idle scenario would give us sub ambient
temperatures but in fact it has settled
in around twenty three point three
degrees almost exactly the ambient
temperature of the room which means we
are basically achieving nothing other
than consuming electricity by putting
the computer inside the fridge but I
promised you guys a load scenario and
that is what I am going to deliver it
should be noted that I observed that to
the touch the side of the fridge which
is where this particular unit seems to
dissipate heat from the hot side of the
HVAC unit is hotter than I have
experienced before you can see we
actually just crept up another fraction
of a degree so our 23.4 right now let's
go ahead and kick it into high gear kids
okay so you can see they've already
jumped to about what we observed in our
outside control test but what this
doesn't account for is that the ambient
temperature in here is going to increase
now that the compressor and
refrigeration system inside here is
overwhelmed so let's watch it happen
shall we all right so this is taking
longer than I thought
- completely reach unreasonable
temperatures and here we are twelve
minutes later the system is still
running but we know enough to know
that it doesn't work this is not even an
overclocked rig and our ambient
temperatures inside the fridge are
steadily climbing i took a reading about
30 seconds ago it was 26 and a half now
it's peaking at 27 depending on how i
diggle the probe so all that's really
left is the explanation for why this
doesn't work well there's no air flow
this is a closed system so this system
relies on itself to move any heat that's
generated inside out so that's going to
be done through the sides of the unit or
in many cases on fridges a coil at the
back a heat sink effectively so unless
you're using a unit with enough capacity
to handle not only keeping the insides
cold but also removing a constant heat
load it isn't going to work so we can't
just introduce airflow by like you know
punching fans in the side so a closed
system depends on the capacity of the
system for cooling now with that said
you guys might go okay well hold on a
second Linus you showed off that the low
powered PC could work and even the idle
PC was not failing at the rate that the
load PC is well that's only sort of true
because fridges are designed for
occasional use some heat from the
outside will transfer inside through the
insulated barrier and it'll have to you
know maintain that also the user will
open it up from time to time to remove a
drink so the compressor fires up and it
gets things back down to a nice cool
temperature they're not designed with
components that are rated for 24-hour
seven-day-a-week operation that type of
workload rating is only going to be
found in a more industrial unit
something like an air conditioner and I
guess that's where we get into the
practical sort of side of phase change
cooling for computers if you have a
large high capacity air conditioner say
for example designed for a room that can
handle that kind of a heat load or
something where an entire building is
air-conditioned then you will get the
benefit of the lower ambient temperature
not only for yourself
but also for your computer also if you
checked out our phase change BC build
guide which you can check out in the
little eye in the corner well if you
apply the phase change cooling directly
to the heat load and you're controlling
the scope of what you're cooling we
haven't even fired up the graphics card
in here and we're overwhelming it then
it can be useful as well but again we're
talking high-end components not a you
know couple hundred dollar mini-fridge
and we're talking custom-designed stuff
in that case from LD cooling so yeah I
mean most of you probably knew how this
was going to turn out some of you might
not have because it's all about how you
think about it if you think about your
computer in terms of that it runs at 30
or 40 degrees and so you know it should
be able to be kept cool then I get where
you're coming from but it's more to do
with the total thermal energy not the
actual temperature which are two
completely different things and if you
think about it this way a computer that
consumes you know 300 400 watts at load
is going to be kicking off basically
equivalent amounts of heat that's about
the same as a as a modest space heater
and you wouldn't think putting a space
heater inside a fridge would keep that
cool either would you so there you go
guys the answer has finally been
provided on Linus tech tips not that
anyone else hasn't ever proved this
before you can see in the time I've even
been talking here we've gone up almost
an entire additional degree so I'm going
to go ahead and put the system out of
its misery now thank you for watching if

you guys are looking for something else
to watch now that you've done all that
stuff I'm going to pull up my calendar
