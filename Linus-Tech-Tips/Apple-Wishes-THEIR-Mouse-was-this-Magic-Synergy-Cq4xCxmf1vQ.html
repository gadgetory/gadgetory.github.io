Mac over the Linux again over to what it
what how'd he do that
the Necedah Mouse from Phoenix is
ergonomically designed and comes with an
8200 dpi sensor and Omron switches click
the link in the video description to
learn more this video back from March
31st of 2012 is one of the only videos
that shows my personal setup it's also
about like how I got this job at my
mineral oil computer and whatever else
it's also kind of one of my favorite
videos but as some people noticed I had
two keyboards and two mice that's kind
of weird that was because I had two
computers on two different monitors I
loved that I was able to control both
computers quickly and easily but hated
how I would constantly get confused as
to which mouse or keyboard was connected
to what and usually I'm not looking down
at them when I'm operating them so I
don't know what I evened I'm doing and I
never got used to that
enter synergy in their own words synergy
combines your desktop devices together
for one cohesive experience its software
for sharing your mouse and keyboard
between multiple computers on your desk
and it works on Windows Mac OS X Debian
Ubuntu Red Hat and fedora meat allows
for near seamless transfer of your
keyboard and mouse it also allows you to
do stuff like copy and paste items
between computers or just text or
whatever and it even lets you drag and
drop files from one computer to another
in order to add to that whole cohesive
experience thing essentially it's a
network-based non-video KVM switch that
if you upgrade to the pro version is
encrypted with ssl okay so that sounds
pretty awesome until I mentioned the pro
upgrade thing right I mean most the
software I've shown on this channel has
been free stuff so far other than that
display fusion thing I guess but hold
tight for a minute it's not really that
bad
considering what the program gives you
it's actually pretty cheap it's 10 bucks
or 29 if you opt for synergy Pro which
gives us SL encryption and priority
access to their support helpdesk this
payment gets you the program and all of
its updates for life I opted for the $29
option as SSL encryption sounds pretty
cool and a lifetime priority support is
also pretty cool also because it's
program is absolutely awesome and I
wanted to support the developers not
only do they publicly display their link
to Glassdoor which shows their page of
their employees reviewing their company
on well everything and it's very highly
rated but they also offer free beer and
food like a good startup should looking
at you - okay and that's fine and dandy
but how well does it actually work
actually mind-bogglingly well and I'm
not that surprised as their customers
range from Pixar Cisco Microsoft Amazon
Intel and Facebook to well me
installation is a very simple spam The
Next button style procedure where all
you really have to do is decide if the
computer you're installing it on is the
server also known as the one with the
keyboard and mouse that you intend to
share or the client also known as the
one without the keyboard and mouse you
intend to share or at least maybe
possibly none even plugged in and that's
actually sort of it if you just kind of
want things to work all you have to do
after that is decide where your
computers should go on the screens and
links synergy server configuration panel
one thing to note here is that even if
your computer has a bunch of screens
plugged in in a weird configuration or
whatever it still just kind of shows up
as one meaning even on a triple monitor
wide setup if you have one monitor above
it going on any of the computers that
you have connected any of your monitors
leaving vertically will go to that one
even if it's like super far to the right
and there's computers above that it will
still go to the one that is configured
as above your computer there are also
advanced server settings which most of
which I honestly would leave default and
hotkeys which are actually pretty wicked
these allow you to assign key presses to
rapidly switch which computer is
capturing your keyboard and mouse this
is really helpful if you have a massive
amount of screen real estate or a bunch
of computers hooked up as moving your
mouse around the vast plains of desktop
valley can take quite some time also I
recommend that you enable the windows
option to show the location of your
pointer when you press the control key
once you get above like four screens
things get a little crazy synergy
already has and will continue to make a
galactically impactful difference in to
how I use computers if it does for you
as well I'd love to hear about it this
video wasn't sponsored by them at all
they don't even know that I made it I
just love to see what kind of crazy
setups you guys come up with
now I apparently can't even remember to
shave let alone go to the store to buy
razors so Dollar Shave Club can at least
take care of one of those problems for
me by delivering razors right to my door
for a lower price than the competitors
both my wallet and my face would finally
get some relief if I actually you know
did the thing joining
dollarshaveclub.com means you can afford
to shave with a fresh blade anytime you
want which feels fantastic when you
actually do it and if you even want a
better shave you can pair it with dr.
Carver's shave butter so your average
shave cream it has high quality
ingredients that make your skin feel
soft and smooth and moisturized again
when you actually do it if you want to
get razors so you don't have to have
this thing on your neck like I do go to
dollarshaveclub.com slash Lynas to sign
up for the US Canada or Australian
regions if you liked the video like it
