offered to send me a few cameras of my
choice to check out and since you guys
always ask what kind of camera you
should buy within a certain budget I
thought let's talk about that so today
let's take a look at what you can get
today
under $1,000
B&amp;amp;H is our go-to place to shop for all
of our photo video and audio solutions
check out the link in the video's
description to learn more to be clear
when looking at the $1,000 price point I
wanted to find cameras that you could
actually shoot with for that amount of
money potential lens cost included there
are cameras like the Blackmagic pocket
and the recently released sony a6300
which come in at under $1000 but for the
body only so for that price point to get
them shoot ready you would need to spend
a bit more depending on your needs so
let's dive into your options below the
$1,000 price point first up we have
Sony's rx100 mark for now while it's a
point-and-shoot it is by no means a
sludge when it comes to stills or video
on the inside the rx100 has a 24
megapixel one inch sensor with Sony's
latest BIONZ X processor glass wise it's
sporting a 35 millimeter equivalent
focal length of 24 to 70 millimeters
from Zeiss that has a rather fast
iris range of F 1 point 8 2 F 2.8 which
will still give you the ability to
obtain a shallow depth of field even
from the smaller sensor along with all
the hardware specs the rx100 boasts 4k
video up to 30 FPS at 100 megabits per
second and 1080p up to 120 FPS with a
high frame rate mode that goes all the
way up to 960 frames per second being
available in various lower resolutions
the rx100 is great if your needs fit
within the functionality of a
point-and-shoot camera to me it's a
great sidearm camera for quick shots or
stills where you don't want to carry a
bigger body but still want a really
solid image in our tech shopping in
Switzerland video 90% of the footage
used was shot on the rx100 shooting in
4k at 30fps it was the perfect fit for
that video since we didn't really want
to draw too much attention to ourselves
while shooting in each location as far
as point-and-shoots go the rx100 is the
bleeding edge of what technology has to
offer in a compact camera but if a
point-and-shoot isn't quite your speed
let's take a look at your other options
so this is the canon t6 i or 750d in
regions outside North America similar to
my very first camera the Canon 60d it's
a mid tier DSLR in canons range and
sports a 24 megapixel sensor in a fairly
standard DSLR sized body that has a
rather useful articulating 3-inch touch
screen that you
control all of your settings from or if
you're like me and prefer buttons it has
physical buttons and dials for all of
your most important settings like ISO
shutter speed and iris control
now while the t6i is not a
groundbreaking camera for its class in
the same way the rx100 is it still
offers plenty to those of you just
starting out the aps-c sized sensor will
give you the control to have a shallower
depth of field if you really want to
isolate your subject from the background
the EF mount on the t6 ah gives you
access to the wide range of glass
available to Canon cameras like this
very inexpensive Canon 50 millimeter F 1
point 8 which when paired with the t6 is
still comfortably under $1000 video wise
you're getting 1080p up to 30 FPS and
60fps being available at 720p on paper
the t6 ID doesn't quite match the rx100
video settings but specs aren't
everything as a 1080p camera it's still
a great way to learn the basics of
exposure composition and what makes a
good image in general and as a stills
camera the t6 is still a worthy first
step particularly in its color
reproduction which Canon has become
known for over the years now if a
traditional DSLR and a point-and-shoot
don't really fit your needs you might
want to take a look at Panasonic's g7
coming in at five hundred and fifty
dollars the lowest in our lineup it's a
16 megapixel micro 4/3 sized sensor
capable a very similar 4k to that of
it's more expensive Big Brother the gh4
physically Panasonic gave the g7 all the
hardware buttons and dials you need the
dual dolls in particular on this camera
are a nice touch for exposure control it
also features five programmable buttons
to set and perform most useful functions
along with that the g7 has an
articulating touch screen similar to
that of the canons making shooting at
various heights or odd angles up freeze
size-wise the g7 comes in slightly
smaller than the t6i but also bigger and
a bit easier to handle than the rx100
making it a good middle ground between
the two cameras while internally the g7
has a smaller sensor than the t6i it
makes up for with its sharper overall
video now whether that's the type of
look that you prefer is up to you since
the colors on the g7 in my opinion seem
a bit less natural overall than most
Canon or Sony cameras the g7 also has
the added flexibility of the Micro Four
Thirds mount so you have the option to
adapt a wide variety of lenses to this
camera with adapters such as the Met
one speed booster which I covered in
this video here however keep in mind
that when adapting lenses there are
trade-offs like slower or non-existent
autofocus physical weight increases due
to use of larger lenses made for other
cameras along with the added expense of
buying an adapter that fits your needs
and budget
native micro 4/3 lenses are a good
option if you still want to maintain the
small form factor from your camera to
your lens and with the increased
popularity of Micro Four Thirds cameras
lens lection has continued to get
stronger and there's something for
nearly any budget available to you
so in conclusion all these cameras have
their pros and cons depending on the
situation the important thing to take
away here is that there is not and will
not ever be a perfect camera for all
situations
do your best to identify your needs and
budget and then compare to find the
camera that best fits you speaking of
finding the camera that best fits you be
