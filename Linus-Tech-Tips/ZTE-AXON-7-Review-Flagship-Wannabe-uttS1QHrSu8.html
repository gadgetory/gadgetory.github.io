sponsored my trip to Beijing China to
attend the launch party for the axon
seven some stuff about their new
flagship impressed me with the hands-on
feel of the device and the jaw-dropping
specs relative to the price being among
them but other things didn't the
speakers in my engineering sample
couldn't go full volume without
significant distortion and the camera
was a generation or two behind other
top-tier flagships making it tough to
call it a legitimate flagship killer
regardless of the price but since that
time the software has been tweaked the
hardware has even been tweaked and
perhaps just perhaps my own opinion has
been tweaked let's see by just how much
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description so I feel like I have
a responsibility to open with this the
axon 7 is not going to win every battle
today but its $400 carrier unlocked with
no contracts or other obligations
attached to it with almost every other
device that I'm going to compare it
against coming in at 300 to 400 dollars
more than that for a 64 gig variant
which is the axon sevens base model so
then with that aside like pretty much
every other flagship it packs a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 CPU 4 gigs of lpddr4 ram
and an adrenal 530 GPU the 30 to 50
million power battery is decidedly
average given its 5.5 inch screen size
but quick charge 3.0 over a type-c USB
port is a very welcomed as is the
satisfying tactile lock and volume
rocker button arrangement noise
cancelling microphone and an elongated
sim tray that can hold either a second
sim or a microSD card for additional
storage
none of the obvious cost-cutting
measures are here really the outer
chassis is an all-aluminum affair that
makes wireless charging impossible but
looks and feels good I'll be it more
slippery than I'd like in the hand NFC
and dual band a/c Wireless are accounted
for and the rear groove under the 20
megapixel rear camera and dual LED flash
is a fingerprint reader that while not
in my preferred position on the front of
the phone where I can reach it lying
flat on a desk is lightning fast and
very accurate around front
under the aggressively noise reduced 8
megapixel selfie camera is the meat and
potatoes of the axon 7s standout
features including one that wasn't
present when they gave me a
pre-production device ten weeks ago the
5.5 inch screen is a fantastic looking
Corning Gorilla Glass 4 topped 2560 by
1440
that looks awesome from any angle in any
conditions and may or may not contribute
to the outstanding battery life that I
experienced using this device as a daily
driver which I'll discuss a little bit
more later
it's flanked on both sides then by some
of the loudest and best positioned cell
phone speakers that I have ever
encountered the last thing here then
something that took me a couple of days
to get used to then I absolutely loved
is the capacitive buttons that replaced
the on-screen buttons in the early
sample I mean yes yes capacitive buttons
have definitely been done before but
what makes these ones better than others
is actually something quite subtle look
what happens with another capacitive
button equipped smartphone there's
almost no where to hold it in landscape
and others are even worse ZTE gets
around this maybe accidentally because
they were trying to shoehorn the buttons
in in the last month of product
development by fitting them into a
slimmer than usual strip that makes the
chin bar a perfect size for comfortable
typing in spite of that speaker
placement and by squeezing them in
towards the middle of the phone making
accidental button presses much less
likely while typing and holding the
phone in landscape mode it's a minor
tweak but it makes a huge difference in
the day to day use well done on that
note it's been a long time since I've
rocked a One m7
or a one m8 and it's easy to forget how
much you miss nice loud front-facing
speakers sitting on a desk next to me
playing music it actually doesn't make
much of a difference but when watching
video the axon 7 holds its own against
pretty much anything as a content
consumption device I'm a little
disappointed that the last few volume
levels are basically the same when
listening to music due to some dynamic
range reducing tricks that help with
distortion but at least they solved the
distortion problem in some way as for
headphones ZTE makes a lot of claims
about the phenomenal three-and-a-half
millimeter output of the
seven but I guess the s7 must be pretty
good as well since aside from being able
to push volume levels further past
comfortable
I really couldn't hear the difference
even with a pair of Bayer dynamic DT 990
pro 240 ohm headphones moving on then
this is my first experience with my
favor ZTE s Android skin so I've got
some comments on that overall I give it
a B+ there's good stuff like right hand
left-handed modes for the nav buttons
the ability to uninstall apps directly
from the homescreen the default setting
configurator for PC USB connections so I
don't need to be prompted every time and
the stellar default power management
profile that managed to make the battery
feel about 20% bigger and day-to-day use
without affecting the way the device
worked for me and then there's mediocre
stuff like the functional but slow auto
call gesture and the clunky folder
creation system for the homescreen
followed by some stuff that I would like
to see addressed the stock launcher is
limited to a four by four grid size on
the homescreen
please let me put my stuff on here
thanks the lockscreen
doesn't show notification details until
you press a little bell way up in the
top left corner something that isn't
more secure I'm not hiding my
notification details it's just more
inconvenient because it's another button
to press notification scrolling in
landscape is kind of dirt sometimes and
then finally there's no fast launch
camera gesture or configurable shortcuts
at all for that matter I don't care what
the gesture is wiggle double press long
press let me do something that doesn't
require me to reach the lock screen and
then press something in order to launch
the camera which I guess leads us pretty
well into the camera other reviewers are
giving pretty mixed reports here and I
think there are a few reasons for that
the specs are great a 20 megapixel
sensor behind F 1.8 sapphire glass with
optical image stabilization 4k video
capture etc etc and still pictures under
certain conditions are actually
competitive with the galaxy s7 I mean
it's easy to get some really nice
comparative pictures out of this thing
especially with the manual mode
fine-tuning
they just have some work to do when it
comes to clear capture of moving
subjects these shots are from the Galaxy
s7 and the axon 7 in auto mode in the
same lighting conditions one of them is
somewhat usable in a this is kind of
crappy looking but at least I captured
the moment kind of way and the other one
is just kind of crappy looking not ideal
if you're an avid shutterbug and most of
your subjects oh I don't know say kids
and pets are fast-moving objects which
leads us that I guess to the bottom line
in a world where ZTE was the only
Chinese brand targeting a similar
experience at half the price of the
Samsung's HTC's and apples of the world
my conclusion would be very simple sure
it lacks water resistance which is a key
feature for me but it carries a two-year
warranty and it's an unbelievable piece
of hardware for the price as long as
you're willing to compromise on the
camera a little what makes things more
complicated
is the existence of the 1+3 so it'll be
up to you then slimmer sexier form
factor with more polished software and
from my experience more usable camera or
higher resolution better screen bigger
sound SD expansion and phenomenal out of
the box battery management that's not an
easy decision for me and I suspect it
won't be for you either so I wish you
the best of luck
gee Linus what was that great-looking
vinyl skin you had on the axon 7 and
some of the b-roll great question you
must be new
it's a D brand skin D brand is your
source for awesome vinyl skins they're
available for laptops phones tablets
consoles game controllers and more the
end more is like not a lot more that's
like most of what they do and they use
high-quality authentic true textured 3m
vinyl on every product they feature
unrivaled precision great guides for how
to put them on and most importantly for
people like me who have kind of a you
know style flair you
we like to play around with different
color combinations and see how great or
how horribly they go together best thing
is the D brand configurator you head
over to the site that's D brand comm
we've got it linked in the video
description and you just try out
different skins and color combinations
you turn your device around you look at
what it's going to look like and boom
they ship worldwide it's affordable and
once it's applied it doesn't come off
until you want it to and when it does it
doesn't leave any residue and it
protects your phone from accidental
dings and scratches while looking great
or terrible the choice is yours so check
them out at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button or check out the link
to where to buy the axe on 7 in the
video description also linked in the
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one in our
community forum which you should totally
join now that you're done doing all that
stuff you're probably wondering what to
