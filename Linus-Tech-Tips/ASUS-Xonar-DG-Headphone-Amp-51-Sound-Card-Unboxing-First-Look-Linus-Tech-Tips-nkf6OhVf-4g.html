the zone our DG and really the relevance
of this product to me is mostly to do
with my obsession about headphone amp
sound cards so this is one of the better
values you can get for a headphone amp
sound card because it's still of a
mid-range sound part so it's not super
low-end by any stretch of the
imagination but it's not like uber
expensive either and there might have
been something supposed to be in there
oh cool it comes with a low profile
bracket although I can't even begin to
imagine that would be useful for um I
mean what are you installing this in
that you need like an amped headphone
out cuz I was thinking Media PC but then
I was like well when would you ever plug
headphones into a media PC I don't know
either way I love it because it has a
headphone app okay it's got Dolby
headphone for a realistic 5.1 surround
so it's Virtual Surround it's also got
GX 2.5 which GX 2 point 5 allows up to
128 simultaneous effects for a realistic
3d experience and if you don't have it
then you game with 3d video but only
lame bulky audio alright moving right
along what else we got
Jack sensing front panels that's handy
so even if you accidentally plug them
into the wrong thing in the dark then
you know that won't cause a problem
although i don't recommend usually
plugging things into the wrong thing in
the dark because that can cause problems
we've also got output signal noise ratio
of 105 decibels for 5.1 channel okay
inputs okay so there's a bunch of specs
and whatnot
PCI sound card uses a C media chipset do
to do to do to okay cool let's have a
sound card it's also comes with drivers
ignore those download latest comes with
two QuickStart guides amazing why
English not English okay hold on this
man this must be a packaging error
there's no way oh no look at this
they're both no way they're both English
but they both have a bunch of other
different languages
um I guess this was better than doing
one thick book somehow okay
low profile bracket extra screws and
let's have a look at the sunshine itself
so you find the usual assortment of
color-coded jacks that are compatible
with five point one out as well as a
microphone in you've also got an optical
audio out so you can use that if you're
outputting to digital receiver or
digital speakers or whatever the case
may be there's your C media chipset
right there
there's your PCI interface there's your
front panel audio as well as your
auxiliary in and spit it out and that's
pretty much it I mean it's
straightforward the whole point is it's
good value it's not an apt headphone
output and that's pretty much all I need
to know about it to know that you should
probably get one if you don't have a
sound card at all and you don't want to
get something really expensive thank you
