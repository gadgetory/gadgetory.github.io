expecting to be doing at any time
although I really wanted to do it this
is the Sennheiser HD 800 and I believe
when they say crafted for perfection
that is actually what they were going
for this is the top of the range
sennheiser headphone enjoyment system
however they did produce one that was
higher end that came with its own tube
amp and whatnot but this is an actual
mass production model so to speak I mean
sure they produced like that many of
them we're talking about a $1500 headset
here that comes with a two-year warranty
from Sennheiser and is made for people
who are very very very serious about
their music and listening to them on
very very expensive headphones
alright so then we got here designed and
engineered in Germany made of new
material only may contain polyurethane
foam okay we're not going to spend too
much time on the packaging with this one
because I'm sure you guys are as excited
as I am to see the HD 800 so here's
operating instructions comes in a
variety of languages including English
oh wow
really lots of lots of different
languages here I don't know some kind of
Cyrillic thing cool next we have the
custom limited edition carrying case
well it's not limited edition there's as
many of these as there are HD 800 s and
then once you open it up you get like a
nice little fluffy presentation thing
you have a foam piece here that covers
up the cord you can see there's not a
whole lot they can do in terms of cable
management on something like this
due to its sheer bulk so you end up with
kind of a bundle of wires like this
alright
now I'm not going to talk much about
these in terms of the overall spec or
sort of you know basically like why why
you would want to buy them if you don't
already know why you want HD 800
then you probably don't need them anyhow
but what we are going to do is we're
going to have a close look at this out
when I say limited-edition I guess I do
mean limited-edition these are made in
Germany okay let's have a look at the
side here so high-definition driver
these are 300 ohm headphones so that is
very high impedance which means that in
order to even consider driving these
things that is to say running music or
games or movies off them you need a
powered headphone amplifier and a fairly
substantial one at that think of it in
terms of your movie is like your
headphones are like a rock okay so you
got a small guy that is to say an
unpowered headphone jack okay you got a
smaller value who's trying to move the
rock he can push on it like really hard
and he can move it but it's not graceful
whereas if you took a giant and he moved
the rock he could move it ever so
slightly he could have the control so
that is sort of an analogy that explains
why high impedance so these are all very
large rock headphones require a very
powerful driver that is a giant
headphone amplifier in order to operate
correctly okay inside here we find a
Sennheiser logo which is probably shaped
correctly for the best acoustic
properties okay inside here we find
another one I made that up I don't know
that okay here we have individual leads
going to each of the earphones okay so
you can see they split apart right about
here okay they're just so beautiful
can't wait to try them
here's what I look like with them on Oh
hold on see look it's late left right
slick so jealous right now wow these are
very very open so okay open versus
closed so closed means that you can not
hear your surroundings and your
surroundings cannot hear what you're
listening to open means that you can
hear your surroundings in this case I
can hardly even tell that I have them on
and that your surroundings can hear you
so if you're cranking music on this guy
there's the jack by the way then others
will be able to hear your music as well
but it'll still be less obnoxious than a
similar quality set of speakers and
playing them at that kind of a noise
level if you live in a condo or an
apartment really high-end headphones are
about the best you can do in terms of
enjoying your music and your movies and
your games and whatever else you want to
listen to is the way that they were
meant to be heard now these feel very
large on me I can only imagine how large
your ears would have to be in order for
these to be too big for you they're
quite lightweight though quite
comfortable so the top is got like a
foam padding on the bottom of it and
then these sit sort of very gently on
you I mean it's more like they sit on
your face and like your entire head
rather than just sitting around your
ears I don't really think there's much
else to say about them will actually
here follow me we will be using these
headphones for a particular purpose and
that will be to evaluate the asu's zone
our essence one so this is the world's
first eight-time symmetrical upsampling
USB DAC and headphone amplifier capable
of powering according to a soos
headphones that are up to 600 ohms of
impedance so I don't know where I would
get 600 ohm headphones but whatever and
then we're also going to be comparing
these headphones against some of its
brethren so here I have my HD 5 v 5s
which are pretty beat up and sort of
ratty I have some PC 350 so these are I
guess the 360s are out but these are
sort of high-end gaming headphones we
have Slick's HD v 9 5s ok
and finally we have what would be my
personal favorite gaming headphones the
SteelSeries 7h so we're going to fire
all of these up including the HD 800
plug them into the essence one and give
you sort of semi layman's terms the
business so thank you for checking out
