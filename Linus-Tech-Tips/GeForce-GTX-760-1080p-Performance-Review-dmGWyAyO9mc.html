intel core i7 4770k unlocked processor
if you're a speed freak added until 3500
series SSD to your Haswell system for a
truly enthusiast class experience
welcome to my 1080p performance review
of the geforce gtx 760 from nvidia this
card uses the GK 104 core which is the
same as the last generation GTX 670 and
660ti the latter of which it replaces
however there have definitely been some
tweaks this card is targeted squarely at
1080p gamers so it's in that 250 dollar
sweet spot price point and it delivers
compelling performance in modern games
at high details at 1080p although you
might want to step up to something a
little bit juicier like a GTX 780 if you
want to game it resolutions above that
so what tweaks have been made so a few
things number one is clock speeds have
been increased number two is that memory
bandwidth has been increased we've gone
from a 192 bit bus on the 660ti to a 256
bit bus here ROP s have also been
increased from 24 to 32 however there
has been a decrease it actually has
fewer CUDA cores than the gtx 660ti that
it replaces so it remains to be seen how
that all translates to real-world
performance speaking of real-world
performance we test all of our games in
as real-world scenarios as we can
meaning timed benchmarks using fraps yes
we know FCAT is more effective however
we are only testing single GPU setups
here so it makes less of a difference in
this case and unfortunately we don't
have a frame capture setup yet so
hopefully that's coming at some point
for our test bench we've got a p9 x79
deluxe with 16 gigs of kingston ram a
core i7 30 960 X at 4 gigahertz and an
Tek high current Pro 1000 watt at the
Platinum power supply 128 gig SSD and we
are using afterburner and/or precision
for our overclocking needs with the
NVIDIA 3 20.39 driver and AMD 13 point 6
beta driver we have switched over to
using beta drivers just so we can make
sure we're getting the most out of all
of these cards at the
time that we're doing these videos just
a reminder guys we do run all of our
graphics cards overclocked at Linus tech
tips because we believe overclocking is
relatively simple we've done guides on
it in the past
watch our guides do it because it is
free performance however that means that
sometimes the way cards stack up in our
performance graphs is going to look a
little different from how other peoples
do so if you check out the video
description we've got a link to the
overclocks for running our cards that
most of those should be pretty
attainable for most of you on your own
graphics cards so without further ado
let's get into the games starting with
Metro last light we see a reasonably
strong performance for the 760 it comes
in a little behind the 7950 but that
stands to reason it is a little bit
cheaper and it beats out the gtx 660ti
however given that this is a
generational increase in naming sort of
because it's a 760 replacing a 660ti
which is typically a slightly boosted up
skew maybe is not as much as we might
have expected in terms of performance
increase and we're going to go through
the slides pretty quickly because we're
going to see some pretty repeating
patterns here so tomb raider is pretty
much the same thing so the 760 is a
little bit faster than a 660ti almost
within margin of error for this one next
up is BioShock Infinite where the 760 is
just a smidgen faster than a gtx 660ti
almost within the margin of error moving
right along
we've got Far Cry 3 where the 760
performs pretty much the same as the gtx
660ti Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon shows us
that these gtx 760 really does perform
about the same as the gtx 660ti in this
particular game especially once we
overclocked both cards and finally
Crysis 3 we see at 10% difference in
performance between the 760 and the gtx
660ti so that was a bit of a pattern
sort of performance rundown wasn't it
which leads us more than anything else
to price to performance analysis you get
a bit of a savings versus the older
660ti you get as good or better
Mormons across the board compared to the
gtx 660ti and you get a very mature card
running on the gk 104 core as well as a
few more options because of that 256 bit
bus some manufacturers may opt to offer
to gig and 4 gig configurations
whereas with 660ti we were tied to two
gig and three gig however it would be
quite um quite debatable whether or not
you would benefit from more than two
gigs with this card at this time because
it's very optimized for 1080p and not
really resolutions above that although
for those high res texture gamers out
there yeah you might want all the vram
that you can possibly get so in short
the 760 replaces the 660ti at a lower
price point with more performance does
it look quite like the generational
boost in performance that we were
looking for maybe not quite especially
when you compare it to something like
780 versus 680 but is it a worthy card
at that price I think the answer is yes
thank you for checking out this 1080p
