latest technology I mean the first Rumbo
was introduced in 2002 and it's now 2015
meaning i'm about 13 years late to the
party but i'm not convinced that
everyone who is interested in a Roomba
already has one so this video is for
people like me who put off trying one
for years because they saw the price of
what on the surface frankly looks like a
silly gadget compared to similarly
priced central vac or portable vacuum
cleaning systems from known brands like
Hoover and Electrolux and just didn't
have the stomach for it until now
welcome to my thoughts on owning the
iRobot Roomba 595 pen Edition now that
I've had it for a few months and if
cleaning supplies aren't interesting to
you don't worry I think we've got
something that is who makes the best PC
stock cooler Intel or AMD we'll find out
but first this
so you can save on Intel 730 series SSDs
with instant rebates during president's
week February 22nd to March 1st 2015
click on that base to learn more now
most Roombas have pretty similar
features give or take some advanced
doodads here or there so while the
actual model that I got was a fairly
obscure Costco exclusive one here in
Canada anyway most of what I'm saying
will apply to all modern
fourth-generation Roombas in general
except with like some extra bits here
and there so in the box you get the
Roomba itself a base station with an AC
power cord two virtual wall doodads uh
this little red cleaning tool thing for
the brushes and another one a couple
extras each of the side brushes filters
bristle brushes and beater brushes the
last one just in case you can't find a
broom and the big Quidditch match is
coming up next Saturday anyway bad jokes
aside the accessory package is actually
overall outstanding and even though
Roomba is definitely going to bleed you
dry on overpriced replacements through
their store in the long run at least
they have the decency to keep you up and
running for a reasonable period of time
before that becomes necessary and they
offer some pretty tangible upgrade
options as well if you're looking to get
a bit more performance or battery life
out of your device and of course
third-party options are out there if you
want to save a few bucks alright so
let's do a quick tour of the device
itself these have come a long way since
even the demos that I saw in my first
year attending CES back in the late
2000s on the top is all the controls
that you'll need buttons to set up
scheduling that's a cool feature of this
particular pet-friendly model a spot
button for when you don't need to clean
a whole room but you just want to do a
deep clean in a particular isolated spot
a dock button to tell it to go dock
itself to its charging station a clean
button which should be pretty
self-explanatory it sprays water out the
top of the unit bidet style and you kind
of squat over it to click no that's not
what happens it starts a cleaning cycle
for the room that it go around the road
I mean did you really believe that man
actually come up with some other
nonsense to tell you how about this one
the dirt detect light illuminates to
tell you the roomba detect
dirt wait that's actually what that does
it cleans a little heavier when it
detects dirt or something hitting some
kind of sensor cool
also on the top is the big red button to
access the replaceable filter and to
dump out the dirt canister there are
speaker holes for the tones that the
Roomba uses along with the error code
displayed to tell you stuff like hey I'm
done hey I'm getting started hey charge
the bloomin battery yeah fart loud much
more politely than that of course at the
front we find the infrared sensor for
the virtual wall units that sends out
beams telling the Roomba not to cross
them though frankly my wife found it was
less work to close doors or find some
random boxes to put in its way than to
use these as well as a physical bumper
that tells the Roomba when it's hit a
wall or other solid object then if we
flip it over there are four infrared
sensors for edge detection to keep your
fancy gadget from flinging itself over a
cliff like the rest of the lemmings and
while we're down here there are the
charging contacts a caster wheel the
little brush that is needed to grab
debris away from the edges around walls
and corners thanks to the Roombas round
shape a couple super grippy drive wheels
and the beater and brush spinning pieces
that are actually responsible for
removing hair and dirt from the floor to
be sucked up but that's all fine and
good in theory how well does the darn
thing work great question in some
respects really well in spite of all the
drop-offs in my house the Roomba has
never fallen down for me and it does
anywhere from an 80 to 90% job of
cleaning most of the hallways and rooms
in my house it's actually a very
impressive little piece of technology
but there are some drawbacks to the
experience as well the preparation for
Roomba is a bit more involved than just
kind of grabbing a hose and then like
going to town you're going under things
and all that kind of stuff you got to
set up your barricades position it and
come back to it when it's ready for the
next task that and the rumbas approach
to room cleaning especially if your
rooms contain a lot of furniture and
other obstacles feels a touch on the
random side and even though it actually
eventually seems to get pretty good
Brigit takes a really long time much
longer than it would take you to do it
yourself manually but Linus I think
you're missing the point you don't have
to be actively vacuuming so that's where
the time savings comes in and yeah it is
but there are some other things that
weigh into it for me I mean for one
thing the noise the Roomba makes is kind
of annoying not as bad as as a
standalone vacuum cleaner but having it
running for extended periods of time
does bother
especially my cats and for another the
darn thing gets stuck on or fails to
clean enough things in my house like
this black border drug that it refuses
to go on to but won't stay inside if I
start on top of it but I have to check
on the room but periodically and so
while I can do other things while it's
cleaning I can't go too far away or
it'll often end up sitting there doing
nothing
it also requires some things that my
central vacuum system doesn't more
upkeep as far as replacement parts is
concerned very frequent emptying of the
dust chamber about once per room
charging so it can be used only for
about one or two rooms per charge before
you either have to pick up your base
station and put it in the room it's
cleaning so that it can dock to it when
it's done something that's a bit of a
pain sits the cord for it is so bulky it
actually kind of gets in the way of
cleaning in the station or pick the
Roomba up and take it back to the base
station but I guess the bottom line is
this and I'm going to keep it I paid for
it I'm going to keep it and continue to
use it or not and the answer is that
while the price tag for what is
effectively a cleaning accessory that
does not replace a normal vacuum is
pretty high and I'm not actually the
ideal customer for the Roomba folks with
smaller single-story dwellings with
fewer obstacles or this babies
wheelhouse since it can't clean things
like a sunken living room or stairs
and it's just kind of set and forget I
still plan to continue to use it and I
do plan to keep it I mean if the whole
house needs to be cleaned it is still
more efficient to just grab a vacuum and
do it properly it'll be more thorough
and you know it that needs to be done
periodically anyway just to get under
things like tables that the Roomba can't
access but the thing about the Rumba is
that if you make it part of your daily
habit it definitely does a great job of
dramatically decreasing the required
frequency of proper cleanings as long as
you're willing to accept a few plant
casualties along the way
speaking of plant casualties xsplit that
live-streaming software that we use for
our weekly video podcast the land show
has nothing to do with plant casualties
they recently released xsplit v2 which
has even more powerful production tools
and actually I mean honestly exploits
just kind of awesome whether your
professional streamer first-time
streamer or even just someone who wants
to broadcast gameplay to show their
friends a few tips and tricks I mean
honestly we actually even use it just
for for screen recording like I set it
up for my neighbor I totally used my I
totally used my code which you can find
in the video description by the way
totally is my code download an expletive
II was watching these he he's taking
this online course and he had no way to
go back and reference the material and I
was like oh well you can just use this
thing and you can record your screen or
record webcams record whatever you want
all at the same time the interface is
extremely intuitive he's like 60 and he
can do it so there's that and it allows
all kinds of great features you can
easily manage guests through Skype you
can hook it up directly to your games
via game source if you're a game
streamer which ensures high fidelity
capture with a minimum performance hit
and it even lets you easily stream and
record your gaming moments with game
caster which has an easy-to-use in-game
overlay to manage all of your streaming
or recording settings so head over to
xsplit comm slash Linus to start
streaming and recording in HD for free
