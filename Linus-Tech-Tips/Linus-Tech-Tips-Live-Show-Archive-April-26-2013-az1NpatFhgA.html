that we shouldn't have any difficulty
with audio or video but every time I say
that why would you say that right where
did you just say that every time I say
that it ends up being a bit of a problem
for us so hopefully that's not going to
be the case tonight but we've
repositioned the microphone so the funny
thing is normally the complaint is
always that the audio is too low but
during the pre-show people were saying
no no it's too loud it's like okay well
apparently everyone's volume knob is
broken because the problem is that
everyone's volume knob ranges from
everywhere from the bottom all the way
to the top so someone it's too loud
someone it's too quiet and there's
nothing we can do
at all someone says they were kidding
about it being too loud that's really
not helpful yeah it's actually actually
not helpful because we actually have had
problems with audio before so guys this
is the new time for the live stream I'm
actually gonna go ahead and launch the
YouTube video that says hey we're live
so you should probably join and and and
not be not watching the live stream I
have a feeling that we're not gonna have
a ton of viewers live tonight just
because I think people aren't going to
be used to the new time and we told
everyone like super late last night yeah
people today yeah some people today and
we told everyone last week that it was
going to be moving to monday but then
there's a there's a very good reason we
didn't move it to monday and it has to
do with like gnomes what are you doing
yeah it's not on ok i can't even watch
because what yeah i lose an ad oh this
video made a plate i guess maybe yeah
must be over um so yeah we we went with
this time slot for a very good reason
and the reason for that is that because
of the way that the earth turns and
because of where the International Date
Line is for some people when we live
stream pretty much no matter what it's
going to be tomorrow and so if it's if
it's a monday and it lands on someone's
tomorrow morning then while we
understand that it's not perfect for
everyone in australia and asia to have
it be in the morning we figured a
Saturday morning is probably better odds
wise than any other day of the week in
the morning and then the reason that
we're still on for Friday night is that
it was really challenging for a lot of
people to stay up late in Europe when it
was on like a monday night and they had
to go work on a Tuesday for example and
I know not everyone works nine to five
monday to friday but we have to we had
to do something and it couldn't stay
where it was we tried grabbing high as
possible percentage
is in every field and this is what we
came up with yeah I mean that I had to
be 4pm it kind of had to be during the
week so it was what day during the week
and if we had it the only day that had
actually had an advantage was friday
because all the other days you run into
the exact same problems and then friday
you have that slight advantage of some
people being on saturday instead of some
people being on during school or work at
like nine a.m. on a tuesday wednesday
thursday you know what the irony of it
is is that probably one of the worst
time zones for this slot is ours yep so
I had I had Tim from Timmy tech TV who's
done in Seattle he works at Microsoft he
has his own YouTube channel he was like
um uh huh yeah it's it's kind of like
I'm not gonna be able to watch anymore
well my my mom tries to be like over
what are you over supportive and like
every possible thing ever and it's just
Rob about everything which is awesome
but she's like well I can't really watch
it anymore oh like it's okay the
archives there okay don't worry it's
really all right it's like she she she
tries to contribute things that we could
might talk about stuff but she like I
don't know I love that she watches it
but don't understand at the exact same
time because there's no way she
understands like three cores what we're
talking about but yeah I mean she
probably understands when we're talking
about like Harry Potter yep so and then
we talked about like 7790 and then we
got torn apart for talking about Harry
Potter because I gave away a bunch of
spoilers and never supers that we can't
talk about the guess it doesn't the
things your mom gets we're not talking
about sorry sorry slick um you know what
why don't we start with let's let's
start with something pretty easy today
why are they putting the Star Wars films
on a release schedule right what's once
every summer yeah but right at once once
every summer that's insane that's
catches me oh because stuff like like
Harry Potter was on early schedule I
believe well really schedule ish and
Lord of the Rings was definitely on a
release schedule and yeah the hobbit is
released okay hold on hold on hold yeah
all of this was pre filmed yeah well
yeah that's right yeah whereas they're
setting like as far as I know I can
imagine they've done any degree of
planning for episode 10 I don't know
stones are gonna do episode 7 rather
pardon me like I it's like mold so some
it's that's what this reeks of it's like
what goes wrong with every actually here
problem you should totally be we should
probably be providing the links so this
was a link on the verge so we are not
the source for this news so you guys can
check it out here but this really reeks
up executive somewhere making a decision
that has no basis in reality this is
like like I look at someone like Disney
and I go yeah they've done so many good
things with so many good franchises I
kind of had faith in them but I mean
come on guys you can't you can't rush
the creative process like who are you EA
know it's early for my shot at here we
have to take our weekly shot Oh pal okay
it's like how's your nuts feeling from
last week here let me give you another
one you want a break no it's like we
must have a new game I mean I mean
that's what happens game like sports
games used to be good now what are they
there are rehashes of the same damn
thing every time I mean is that what
this is gonna be it's bad decisions that
get made early on in the process that
end up turning it into something
unsustainable no one more blades of
steel and I mean I mean I mean okay
another thing too is like look at how
long it took to make the original three
widget quite frankly they didn't they
probably shouldn't have taken quite that
long but we're looking at my Oh what
Mark Hamill goes from like like super
hot youngster with really bad hair to
like ugly old guy with good hair and
it's like him that he never won he could
never win how could how did he stand a
chance of being a heartthrob are they
gonna do the same thing to a whole new
generation of stars well no well no
definitely not I mean the only problem
is they're not going to age the next
thing they have to do to really sort of
make me not even bother showing up at
the movie is cast sheila booth oh god
wasn't that awful and its antigen
oh I mean with that said the casting
couldn't be much worse than it was for
the prequel trilogy so and I mean the
word on the street so the rumors is that
they're bringing together a lot of the
original cast to play you know PES with
some of them yeah some of them are like
I don't really want to do this yeah but
hopefully they can just throw enough
money at them but it actually reminds me
so I kind of see that happening it's
Disney and it's the star wars franchise
I mean just on the basis of the money
they're going to be reaping from you
know a new a new sort of generation of
Mark Hamill action figures like if I was
one of those guys that's holding out I'd
be I'd be asking for sort of a piece of
some of the pie in some way as opposed
to a lump sum amount but then if I'm
Disney I'd be crazy to give them that so
I'm sure it'll all come down to the
individual negotiating tables but i
really hope they'll find a way cuz yeah
i mean you can bring back a series but
if you bring it back and kill it yeah
it's disney they're doing pretty damn
good with their action hero movies i
know but they're okay tell me something
though dude they put something like
spider-man on a we have to release a new
one every year like what if they did
that to Batman I don't know I honestly
don't know because they've been doing
the cartoon series for so long now okay
Star Wars whatever it's cold I don't
even know I've never seen it yeah i
don't know i saw the animated Clone Wars
movie was terrible it was like the worst
thing I've ever seen it the cartoon one
terrible I haven't seen either I don't
know why don't we do you know what guys
we're opening up the Twitter boards
because I'll let us know how is the star
wars animated series we'd love to hear
your feedback and we're looking for one
word answers here guys we don't want an
essay it is Twitter after all so you
know terrible great I mean this is an
acceptable response um damn there's
another one what to punch
oh man they want to know its licks ever
gonna start his own channel would love
to have a sort of podcast with you
talking about tech stuff I don't know if
I'll do one talking about tech stuff
this is kind of a podcast and we're
talking about tech stuff I'm talking
about Star Wars so far but yah
lightsabers are nerdy stuff I guess
you're wearing star wars shirt but i am
wearing a Star Wars shirt that's not
even on purpose to I know yeah that's
awesome love it um if I ever actually
did make my own channel would probably
be something centered around gaming one
of the big reasons that we haven't done
that yet is we haven't found an approach
that we find we have time for we have
time towards a big one that's like
reason a hundred percent of reason this
much of the reason yeah and then a
little bit of the reason is we want it
we if we did that we would want to have
a unique angle and we don't know what
our unique angle would be yeah I mean
and the other thing is you know whatever
he starts I'm gonna want to cut of it so
you know I think from his perspective of
yo you're starting something ninety-nine
percent 99 okay and oh yeah that's on
your own time so you know I'm not gonna
be paying you hourly for it so don't
worry about it um let's have a look and
see if we've gotten any any air we go 28
oh wow ok ok Clark that's a bit of a
strong statement because Star Wars does
not suck yeah certain implementations of
Star Wars might suck good awesome so
good it got cancelled oh and we're
talking about futurama later like we are
talking about futurama are gonna bring
another spin into that Wow James Taylor
you are banned can I ban people Clone
Wars is great yep what do you mean get
past the childishness it's like it's the
most formula it's like dumb kids but
it's like it's like a Land Before Time
sequel like that's how formula it is
it's like the young apprentice who is
you know rambunctious and then ends up
saving the day so it turns out that her
strong willed you know hotheadedness it
was good come on it's a terrible message
no kids should watch it no adults should
watch it um horrible apparently
dunno didn't watch it crappy terrible
terrible canceled better than episode 14
oh come on man saying it's better than
episode 1 is like saying that it's like
you know more cleanly shaven than slick
um what you don't want razor right okay
fine sorry go ahead razors coat you have
to buy new one let down socks horrific
awesome for kids story line can we get
story line instead of like maybe the
animation sucks maybe the dialogue is
terrible but like the story like because
I'm wondering is is Disney gonna pull
anything for that storyline like are
they gonna take anyone from that series
and continue them working on the new
series you know I really wish okay here
here's the way this is gonna work anyone
from Disney if you're watching this is
how you need to do it because I'm
evidently an expert because I wear a
star wars shirt I'm super old if they
are licensing fee no no it's like
ironically retro see it's intentionally
like broken Wayne yeah I know I'm
opposing um if they're gonna make this
work on a one-year release schedule it
has to be expanded universe content
where their licensing their licensing
books because otherwise to expect new
creative unique awesome like up to the
level of the original movies star wars
scripts on a yearly basis plus execution
on a yearly basis through what I'm
worried about is what you just said what
are you basing it on like what are the
stories based on yeah what would what is
the one year timeline based on what does
any of this based on because story
writing takes so much time before you
can actually start production right
that's why I'm saying and are we gonna
end up with a situation where it's like
you have multiple teams working on it so
it's like that like it's a graphics card
you know where you have a team working
on the one that's three generations from
now and then by the time that's actually
released they're working on something
that's going to be three generate like
if you have like multiple teams are we
gonna have like a B and C quality Star
Wars movies yeah happening every three
year I don't know so I mean it i guess
it depends how much many questions all
the questions
it like it seems that necessary why do
you need so many movies most of the
money from Star Wars comes from
merchandise anyway I mean just
re-released the original trilogy and for
Kane it's like wow i buy it I'd buy it
okay yeah I don't have much money still
by I'd still buy it doesn't matter you
know what they really need to do like if
Disney was really smart go for it I've
gonna do it original not special edition
trilogy in 4k Han shoots first you know
what he did deal with it in 4k he shot
first so I want them to release any pay
for that you know the black and gold
slider box that everyone had yes you
just rereleased that but in blu-ray that
was the special edition but not the
stupid special edition if i recall
correctly yeah cuz i think i was june
that was the one where Han shot first
but then I think it has the extended
scene where he walks over Jabba's tail
and all that other stuff that they that
they worked and I didn't mind that one
yeah I didn't mind that one but i still
liked my originals better just cuz their
original mind you there VHS so it's like
as if i can watch them well the golden
black boxes VHS yeah i know but i had an
original or older yeah older original
okay so James Taylor's redeemed himself
he means he's probably just said like 10
billion spoilers for what stores oh come
on I'm gonna get I'm gonna get your
sleep me up like everything I'm gonna
get hate mail for Star Wars spoilers I'm
sure it's gonna have every week spoiler
alert okay so little bit ha ok anyway J
James is forgiven cuz he means the the
series not the film so yeah because the
animated series is the same name yes so
he's got a point so that's confusing so
it's kind of like Tomb Raider yeah just
like new ones just entirely different
and you know what it's it's one of those
things where it doesn't seem like as
much of a problem because obviously if
you're looking up an article about tomb
raider you know tressfx hair effects or
whatever else then you know what to
murder you're talking about but when we
start to get into games that are are
going to be like the original release is
going to be on the steam platform and
then like the later release is going to
be on this team platform they're just
going to be the same
name next to each out how are you
supposed to well tomb raider one how to
suffix did it not i don't know i don't
think so i don't think anyone ever used
it I think it did because with tomb
raider you know you know how they
started doing that thing we're like if
you pre-order and then enough other
people pre-order the whole idea is that
you share the fact that you can
pre-order if you pre-order and enough
other people pre-order than you unlock
prizes and there's three tiers of prizes
okay tomb raider was one of those and i
think the first tier was you got like
two mater one and two for free I'm just
like what I can't remember exactly what
it was maybe twitch chat will tell me
hopefully twit shadow tell me um but
yeah so like I think it had a suffix and
like the steam can deal with it they'll
have some back-end naming convention
that's different for them it might be
confusing in your games list I mean just
a year would be okay tomb raider 2013
i'd be on with that yeah by the way the
headphones are steelseries in your prose
but then what if metro 2033 like 10 20
years from now they release a rerelease
metro bah well that's kind of like what
blood dragon is in the future in 2007
well yeah but this would actually be
confusing cuz metro 2033 would be the
same as Metro 2033 2033 here however it
would work out oh yeah because it would
actually be that year yeah yeah we
apparently Star Wars is decent according
to dirt perv ah what's a good budget
processor what would you buy if you were
on a budget today FX 41 4300 or whatever
it is it's not a bad route to go be
honest and it depends what depends what
you mean by budget yeah what's your
that's I hate that every single time
anyone has ever treated me with like I
want a budget what do you suggest for
the x component well it's just like what
is your version of budget mean yeah I
usually even asked like what is your
version of a budget because some people
like yeah I'm on a budget only have two
and a half grand for a computer I'm like
okay that's not a budget in my books
yeah that's like that's not like that's
not in the usage I could fit a Titan
into that machine with like a
justifiable
configuration yes so but then people be
like oh yeah it's but it because
technically is a bud yeah it's a budget
I can have a million-dollar budget and
it depends what you're trying to do I
mean if you want to you know if my
budget processor you mean you want to
play games on onboard graphics I'll say
get an APU if my budget process so you
mean you want to edit video with as low
a budget as possible i'd say get an FX
6300 if my budget processor you mean you
know whatever it is that you happen to
anything fifties do quite well really
low in video editing that's a
two-hundred-dollar chip though is that
budget I don't know hey processor
motherboard for 300 bucks to me so now
easily now we've leg both 300 boats
we've ripped on like baron van rooij for
a little while here I'm sorry dude um
we've done a video on the ROG 7970 the
matrix it's on the NCIX comm Channel
first time watching live hey shout out
to Portugal I don't think we've ever
gotten a message from Portugal I don't
think we're gonna have one doesn't
Belgium invention said it was the first
time he's ever been ill to people I've
check this out 2300 live viewers sweet
looks like the new time worked in spite
of nobody knowing about it oh look it'll
like me tweeting it twice I didn't even
yeah i just left side to go see my
brother yeah brother wanted yeah i was
like a game I was like what's your
problem cuz I was like oh can you tweet
it to me so I can retweet it I love the
maternity I was in the middle of doing
it my dad's just like come on well Oh
inside great I guess you couldn't be
late for your brother's thing again that
would have been just bad news bears so
slick missed his brothers starcraft 2
casting thing because he his brother
called and his phone didn't go off and
then because of like the baby and stuff
my brother was trying to be polite not
knock on the door so he just kept on
calling me and he was out there for like
kept on being 45 minutes and it was not
it was not good
and then a man now it was my brother's
championship hockey game yeah i'm
supposed to go watch it and my dad calls
me i'm not gonna be late for that that
wasn't my brother waiting outside ok ok
cuz i was gonna say it happened he can
he would bought up in him friendly snap
and his brothers actually like bigger
and stronger and like just basically
beefier than him he's like if you look
at proportions he's slightly shorter
than me not by a lot he's not actually
short he's just slightly shorter than me
but then he's just like whoa he's a
volunteer firefighter but he takes it
very seriously so it was like
firefighter build so like what slip
could do to me he could probably do this
leg he's picked me up and throw me
around before yeah i got the thing yeah
is that he would ref in hockey whenever
he had to ref one of my games because
everyone's expected him to be bias he
would be biased against me ah so if
anything ever happens like I got in a
slight scrum with a guy once and I just
feel like this big just like fixed grab
the back my jersey I'm like oh it's not
good I just go flying and I'm like oh no
that was bad i think that you did and I
know exactly who's getting the penalty
even though I didn't think it was my
fault but I'm still happy he did it
because if he gave the other guy the
penalty everyone would just on the
entire other team would have just
destroyed you the rest oh just cuz you
brother all that cup so it was actually
way better I'll they'd have finished
every check yeah I've been like not good
yeah it was way better in the end that
he gave me a building and that he threw
me off those things actually um what's
your opinion of the linfield line of
processors they were awesome they were
good value okay I have a paper due soon
watching it very nice sorry kazoo we're
selling a 690 to get a Titan I'm
thinking about it because of how quiet
it is how much quieter is it than a 690
this is actually a good discussion topic
good we don't have i've used to 690 i
haven't okay 69 is a little bit louder
it's noticeably louder titans very quiet
one big thing is are you running
multiple screens but we're the best not
audio but that well okay so audio aside
let's let's tackle the whole question
okay because there's the performance
Delta yeah so for those of you who don't
know 6
690 is a dual 680 card essentially dual
GPU for gigs of ram two per GPU that's
important later toy pause for one quick
second tomb raider one was laura croft
guardian of light shut up it was not was
it apparently some guy just said no
that's a different tumor is it i thought
guardian lights a different one i don't
know i never played any of the first
Tomb Raider game i ever played like that
was on my own system so i actually
played the entire game which i haven't
definitely beat yet was how's she a
guardian alright guys so we think we're
live again frames encoded is going up
and frames dropped is not going up so it
looks like changing the router has not
helped basically what's happening is
while we're streaming our internet
connection is completely knows me is
completely dying um for some completely
unknown reason that we have we have to
color is p yeah it's just kind of
getting ridiculous yeah happens like
every week we've sought the router yeah
there's literally nothing we can do
about it it doesn't happen at all for
not streaming through twitch yep so like
we do stuff that's just as intensive on
the network a single day like uploading
videos to YouTube will do a huge batch
internet does not go out and we'll do
multiple at a time um which is nuts yeah
so I mean this is this is a this is a
this is a problem um so anyway let's get
back to our discussion topic because I
mean sure that's what people want us to
do so 690 versus Titan less effective
memory on the 690 because remember guys
in sli whatever video memory you have
per GPU so if it's four gigs total that
means you have two gigs per GPU that's
all you effectively have whereas a Titan
has six gigs of memory so when you're
running at something like 4k resolution
throw that 690 in the trash because it
won't work well it'll work but I hope
unfortunately we didn't have a 690 but
if you check out some of the results
from the Titan testing that we did a
while ago yeah you can you can
extrapolate from it where the RAM
actually helped a crazy amount yes so
it's already helping even at 1080p and
2560 by 1600
which means it will help that much more
when you get up to resolutions like 4k
which is so Whaler one of the moderators
on the forum is suggesting that it's
possible that our isp is using qos two
or something or something to throttle us
when they see us hitting the the
connection really hard the way that
we've been doing which might throttle
enough that kicks off the race dream
because our internet connection isn't
dying a lot of the time we're still on
skype chat and still seeing twitch chat
even though the stream is down and it's
just giving us messages that say frames
drop drop drop drop drop like we're
actually still connected because when we
lose our internet connection outright
xsplit completely cuts it off right so X
blitz still on just telling us we're
dropping every frame which is like
helpful but but anyway hopefully 720p
will fix the issue my laptop still
doesn't have any internet connectivity
but we're back on okay so I I give up on
this discussion topic because we're just
going to have to move on but in short if
you want to use if you want to play at
higher resolutions tomorrow get a Titan
if you want to run a higher frame rates
today at lower resolutions then the 690
is still the better solution compared to
the Titan I'm really sorry for the
technical difficulties this week guys
honestly there I this is beyond our
control we've done everything that we
can do sorry to interject is it EA 4508
yeah it's still in the a 4500 so it's a
it's a high end powerful router I really
don't think that's the issue so first
time watching in Germany hello Germany
and I'm glad to hear that the new
schedule is way better for you guys same
thing with Italy first time from there
good morning from the Philippines thank
you for waking up early and I'm sorry
that we were that we were not here for a
little while and I'm sure that all these
twitter messages her about that we
weren't that we weren't here so when we
move into our next discussion topic ZTE
has caved and is paying royalties to
Microsoft on their android devices so
let's go ahead and fire that bad bleh up
there you go guys so this is a daily
tech article
another one bites the dust so what are
the implications of this um the be
another one bites the dust thing no not
another one that sounds like why do you
what what what so no Microsoft is going
around jumping everyone okay but why I
mean uh what what spurred this cuz I'm
sure they could have done there's a
generation or two ago if they felt like
it well we talked earlier right but they
weren't there okay it's the point and
just build it I'm minish I'm like come
on say anything I'm trying to grab the
dog psychic tweeted oh it's people can
actually get the link for themselves huh
oh don't worry about that talk to them
okay so Microsoft has Windows 8 Phone
and Windows 8 everyone's going on crazy
patent wars right now and Microsoft has
times and with Windows 8 Phone a few
people were like hey pay us money for
royalties and stuff so Microsoft kind of
got tired of it was like fine you know
what all of you are paying us all the
money because if you guys going to be
jerks we're just gonna be way bigger
jerks than you are so I mean we
discussed this a little bit last week
we're Microsoft's bringing in 10 plus
dollars often / android device sold from
the manufacturers um regardless of
whatever else more than half the Android
devices this was before the ZTE um the
ZTE sort of capitulation here um pachoo
Lucian well that's that's that's the
actual word i know i was looking for a
simple one but that's before they're
there they threw in the towel and so now
it's getting to the point where pretty
much whatever android device you buy you
are giving money to microsoft and that
is the way that it is going to be yeah
yeah basically it's just another one to
their this what's going on with your
computer I keep accident this button is
stupid yeah don't worry butters I just
keep accidentally hitting it cuz it's on
the side it's so noticeable because it's
so loud his laptop keeps turning like
coming off we're going into sleep or
something cuz there's a button on the
slide on the side yeah it's just
sleeping and he just keeps hitting it so
we um yeah they're still gonna go after
more
they're still going to just start
grabbing all the money they're saying
like Motorola patents if anyone was
following motorola patents from back the
day when all that stuff was going on
back the day like two years ago uh-uh if
you're following that at all you know
how big of a deal that was and people
are speculating that the Microsoft
patents are worth around a thousand
times more right so that was such a huge
deal and this is worth a thousand times
more sorry yeah that's gonna sustain
them for a while I suspect it for those
who died I've got keeps I keep seeing
these articles Microsoft's doomed
Microsoft's going down Microsoft won't
exist yes they will yeah Microsoft will
find a way yes they will Microsoft is
going to take over the living room with
the next generation xbox yeah that's my
prediction Microsoft's gonna win I
personally won't own one all right I'll
night own one but I won't have it hooked
up so I personally won't use one but
they are gonna own it and that is a huge
victory never mind if you know they
can't get their foot in the door
mobilize for a little while longer
however long it takes the fact that they
own all these patents is going to give
them enough money that they can do
whatever they need to do to get
competitive and whatever other spaces
it's not like Chrome OS is going to be
taking over anytime soon you know in
spite of what people might hope it's not
like Linux is going to be taking over
anytime soon it's still so fragmented um
yeah yeah you can make what fine quarter
bottle okay go ahead you know it's not
gonna happen Steve's moving to linux
groups like you bun to and mint are
making very very user-friendly versions
how long have they been doing that for a
while yeah and they're increasing
constantly okay you can just stay over
there I don't know where I was going
with it there are their user base is
constantly increasing it's constantly
getting easier to use and more things
are constantly being adapted to be able
to use it like every single Kickstarter
that gets launched has a stretch goal
for linux because so many people ask for
it steam is going to be adapting to legs
a lot of pc users are no
longer happy with the windows experience
of what was eight speaking of the the
windows experience with Windows 8 here's
another another daily tech article that
we wanted to bring up today and that is
the rumor I think the verge reported on
this as well that the start button will
be returning in Windows 8.1 which might
be called windows blue or whatever it is
they're going to call it but the catch
is that it dumps you in the they're
calling it metro but I think what they
mean to say is a modern UI which is of
course very different from 0 daily check
ups League UMP is from the verb from the
verge I just didn't go get the verge
article because I was trying to go
really quickly okay well it's the
Verge's scoop um so daily tech picked it
up from there and like honestly what's
the point because I don't know how many
of you guys have used windows 8
extensively at this time but check this
out okay this is a windows 8 notebook
okay I'm going to take my mouse cursor
so imma move it down to the bottom left
and what you guys what y'all are going
to see is that there's a little preview
of something there that says start on it
actually and if I click it will take me
to the modern UI so if the basic
difference here is that Microsoft thinks
that the problem is the absence of the
start button then they're really missing
the point it's like there's two little
kids and the one kid asked for the
sucker so the big kid takes like the top
off then it gives them the bottom yeah
it's like there is your sucker it's like
yeah you have a sucker it's like but you
like licks that one and took all the
candy off it like it's not this let's
not want to actually want it like the
good thing about the Start menu is small
mouse movements but think about that
small most movement that's what's good
about a UI is less motion fewer clicks
and Metro even with the smallest tile
sizes here is going to be just just to
go from one thing to something six away
is going to be all the way across your
screen who wants to do that I mean
computer users are notoriously lazy oh I
understand if it takes site that's why
we use the computer
but you know what I know the search is
supposed to mitigate that somewhat but I
honestly I don't I don't feel it like
typing to get to a program unless you
already remember the name of the program
and I mean and then with the with a new
search like and the search that that
sort sorry control panel versa I have
they not patched that so bad were you
search for something like you know it's
so infrequent that I've got something in
more than one of those areas like and
even when I do I can just sort through
ladies device manager brings up nothing
you have to then go and oh no I meant a
setting called device manager as opposed
to the game called device manager you
know what no no no so it should make
device manager simulated haha stimulator
so it doesn't actually do it and it's
like it's it and like you have to manage
like the little yellow exclamation marks
that come up from installing new
hardware and process unprocess and like
like formatting your new hard drive so
it should have like device and disk
managers no details like wait I know
that's what the disk manager but
sometimes the new disc doesn't even show
up in device manager so you have to
refresh the list before you format it
really a device manager and see this is
why this is why I line maybe that's
going to come into those the new line of
educational games how to use the device
manager it's a game yet you can reward
people of points and like when you get
ten tasks that you've ended the process
of ya get an achievement and the final
boss will be a device that Windows
Update can't find the drivers for so you
have to search for the PCI vendor ID and
the device ID and you have to go to the
PCI database and find it and then track
down a driver on some obscure like
driver repository site that doesn't give
you a virus and then it and yeah exactly
and you have to like dodge the wrong
download button and everything you have
to dodge the wrong download button but
they'll be moving because it's a boss
fight a home person and then there won't
actually be a driver revision for your
OS but the OS that works on runs on the
same kernel so you have to modify the
text file to
add the support for your OS I was so mad
it took me probably two hours to get
some intel nic driver working on windows
I'm zoo I knew this was gonna have a
root in something looks like he's going
some I was so mad I was like come on
it's based on Windows 7 there is no
reason they shouldn't work oh oh well
we're in tell it's a consumer Nick bah
bah bah I don't care windows home server
is a consumer OS it's called home server
just because they specifically didn't
write in the compatibility for that OS I
really wish that they just write out the
ones that they know it doesn't work with
as opposed to having to write in the
ones that it does work with because
that's what happens with older hardware
is it doesn't get updated even if it
does work like there's old Wi-Fi
adapters that'll still work with windows
8 in like compatibility mode or whatever
else yeah and then there is that old
hardware software isn't hard coded what
it works on it just still it just won't
install doesn't matter unless you fake
it and then it works anyway that was my
rent for this half hour segments of the
live stream not promising there won't be
another one there probably will be I
don't even remember how about those
friendly old days Oh back to really
three shots of them in one life um so
speaking of speaking of horrible things
the HTC One no microphone microphone
yeah I was like where are you going with
this so are we saying it's horrible
no-good nokia got a band in the EU I
would think Nokia would be happy about
anyone who's taking market share away
from Samsung it's like really like the
lesser of two evils at this point you
guys but I think I think what they're
gonna turn this into is like oh we got a
band for you but we can lift it if you
pay us royalties on that microphone you
got right so here backstory for those
who don't know okay so HTC hi homes I
don't know no seriously my bad I was
trying to go really fast
it's like I didn't have like any time
yeah literally like I need a bit of a
condensed schedule today because we did
go to NCIX today we went early and then
we had to get back early in time to do
the live stream so that I can take care
of the baby tonight so it's gonna be a
long day anyway so HTC One banned in
Europe nokia laid the hammer down
microphone technology so the metal phone
technology is nokia's so nokia fought in
the core it's a great night like yeah so
much geophone in the course is like this
is actually kind of our stuff you can't
just put that in that without asking us
at all and no HTC's be like it was a
wire yeah but that doesn't matter at all
because you still used it in your phone
so it's kind of a big patent war just
like everything else in technology at
all ever at this point in time um I
heard they're going after it in the US
as well which would basically give HTC
know where to sell the one no I'm so
from China where it has missed except in
China where they revised the phone okay
so get this so they lose some of the
unibody pneus of the construction of the
phone so this middle piece from the line
here to the line up here pops off dual
sim and a microSD slot BAM I'm just like
k where's mine I mean I love the one I
actually do I have an s4 I haven't been
able to bring myself to actually start
using me as for yet about it for like a
week and a half because I really love
the one I have an android i switched
blog update coming soon but if it had a
micro SD card it would just be like huh
like Oh perfect cuz i don't need the
removable battery um HTC has a history
with Nokia okay uh is it nokia who's
just okay yes okay yeah okay apparently
this is like the 40th time that they've
had this type of problem okay it's it's
somewhere in the article so if you read
the we didn't post here we didn't post
the articles so i think it's on daily
tech so if you go to day to check I
think the articles on there if you read
the article i think it's like the 40th
time they've had this style problem not
with the one but like in history so
these two companies have a history so
maybe that comes into thing where you're
like lesser of two easels with Samsung
if it doesn't matter because they just
hate each other cuz it's just like
grudge match time you gotta wonder
like how much of the margin they make on
phones goes to litigating against each
other so much like how much cheaper
would have phone be for a consumer if
they didn't have to spend a butt ton of
money paying licensing fees to each
other where it's just like quite frankly
it's for lack of a better word it's just
a big circle jerk at a certain point
first like okay i'll give you money and
then you can give me that money well
just like you know will halt at each
other's back all the lawyers in the
world are like yeah yeah I'm sure the
courts are just tired of it job
preservation they are you heard about
the thing in the States what's that um
talk to them just cuz you told me
something I'm trying to get you there
what brainer it's out of my green like
not that I owe you um what was I gonna
say so I think it was in the States I
haven't read way too much about this so
someone's probably gonna prove me wrong
somewhere um but basically the courts
are saying you guys need to stop
collaborating stop helping each other
stop cooperating close your freaking
doors don't talk to each other anymore
like make all your employees sign 80,000
page n da agreements like stop talking
to each other stop using each other's
things because it's just this leg antic
ridiculous thing of everyone suing each
other so what they're trying to say now
is literally just know you use your own
stuff stop suing each other stop using
each other's things oh steve says that
apparently the apparently the sales ban
is for the mics for the phones that have
already so so the ones that they've
already made our okay they have to
remanufactured new phones for that
market with a different microphone but
that will cause delays on an already hot
device that everyone and their dog and
their dogs other pet are waiting for
right now so okay maybe not quite as
dire as we thought but it certainly
won't be um won't be will be bad okay
just like it sweet yeah check the one
below it the one blood I hope this will
be short I'm not gonna go on this super
long right so there was a leaked video I
have seen it it's like 20 minutes long
he shows all the settings in the game
except like thoroughly scrolls through
them except for his video settings what
you need to
learn when you're looking at stuff is
you need to look at what's not shown he
does not show you the bottom as video
said hey give contact how about the
people who haven't watched it like me
what are you talking doesn't elder
scrolls online know what about it I just
said the leaked video yeah what about it
doesn't look very good look I see I just
know that okay sorry the graphics don't
look very good in the video it you're so
fired today no I don't feel very good
leave me alone ok so the graphics don't
look very good in the video and a lot of
people in the comments 0 like oh my god
this looks terrible but then if you look
at released footage from tons of other
reviewers that are all saying it looks
great is he playing on a GT 630 year
well the thing is there's like it shows
some setting is very high some other
settings very high but then if you
notice his profiles aren't custom and he
does not scroll down and the scrollbars
small I'm thinking there is a ton of
options and he just choked a whole bunch
of them because this whole thing was
like oh it's terrible and his name in
the game was like the worst or something
the worst so I think he's trying to
troll what I would what I'm trying to
say is where he should have gotten the
beta key instead of that guy that what
you're trying to say right under sit no
no okay there's Bureau that's been
released by other reviewers that was
like taken with fraps but by Bethesda so
you have to assume and no at that point
time that they are running at the max
possible settings yes unlike multiple
Titans very possibly okay so you're
looking at the best possible use case
and you're looking at the worst possible
use case that this guy could fend angle
so it looks okay by showing you the very
very little tiny bit at the top of the
video settings just wait until open beta
is out wait till whatever you don't have
to buy the game open beta is going to
release at some point time they've
already said that it's going to be open
you're gonna be able to play it before
you have to buy okay as long as you jump
on for open beta I mean wait it'll be so
it all comes back to my strategy which
is to just not pay attention at all I
dropped two hundred and fifty dollars on
star citizen I haven't looked at a
single email they've sent me cuz I'm
just gonna drop right in there and I'm
gonna just go for it at any time how
this goes online could look terrible
personally I don't care i still play
moreland graphics aren't the biggest
problem for me flora wind is so brutal
morwen looks terrible I still love it
it's a Elder Scrolls games to me it
doesn't matter it's the game play some
games always s he's gonna talk about
elder scrolls for another store in it
sorry I tried to make this short Oh
games like elder scrolls I like the
gameplay like the storyline I like being
all the free room all like I stuff
certain games I'm like Bioshock and tomb
raider gained a huge aspect because they
look so good right it's the I'm beyond
beyond yeah like the environment is huge
different games like her more anyway so
I'm gonna try and not talk too much
about this guide actually talk about
something else ever okay so why don't we
let's do a little bit of Twitter let's
do a little bit of Twitter questions um
why did i get a broken psu delivered I
don't know my bad luck cuz you also
power supply and you're unlucky yeah and
your name is full name and your at
handle is Linus what is the new
14-nanometer Intel plant and Intel going
to start production I have no idea what
I can tell you guys though is that we
just saw an architecture change so there
will be a process shrink at some point
what they normally do is they
manufacture simple things like flash
NAND or NAND flash I guess is the
correct order of that so they
manufacture simple things like man
flashed before they start our chipsets
for example before they start
manufacturing CPUs there so probably not
for a while but I guess we'll see
apparently it was only in the
Netherlands not the Holy you the article
I read said 'hey i read one that said
netherlands and i asked you and then the
order gloria to do you okay okay okay
well there you go we don't mean to
misinform y'all but apparently it
happens from today especially prepping
for last June was really right you know
what we should really have is we should
have a disclaimer at the bottom of the
screen like a psychic we actually have
no idea little information for
entertainment purposes only like I guess
I could yeah the disclaimer to end all
disclaimers you know that's the thing
that kills me is the people who believe
in psychics even though by law they have
to have that disclaimer it's like it's
like not believing that cigarettes will
put tar in your lungs oh it's like it's
on the box it's on the screen they use
it in production and now that we have
now that we have HD
tvs and we can actually remember when
all the little fine print nice to be
actually not possible to read how was
the best and that was actually like a
problem and blah blah blah yeah now now
we can read it so now there's no excuse
for you know I like Miss Clara or
whatever her name is it was clear yeah
there's no there's a psychic late oh I
don't miss miss cleo or something like
that whatever it doesn't matter I have a
68 70 oh this is a good question my 6870
pin frozer has a non reference PCB so
there is no full cover block available
what do you think of vga only water
cooling if you can honestly normally
what people end up doing in order to
make it work is custom making like the
MOSFET and RAM heat sinks or even though
I like cutting up old you know like CPU
heat sinks or whatever you got to do you
can buy them you can buy them but a lot
of the time the lens you buy are not
good enough so be really careful make
sure you have good contact make sure you
clean the chips appropriately use a
really good thermal adhesive for example
the one that's in my wife's computer I
used not the ones that come on Swift xmc
for teens but I used the ones that i
bought aftermarket 3m thermal adhesive
that's balling and that's the only
reason they don't come off also don't
use little tiny heat sinks unless you're
planning to actually aim a fan at the
GPU as well use beefy heatsinks use
awesome heat sinks like cut-up old cpu
heat sinks and make the fins this long
if it's on a vrm component if you do it
properly it's fine otherwise it's a bit
of an issue yeah um so it's doable but
it's sketchy be careful and be thorough
so I got ahead of myself and I kind of
thought that his question was about
something else but speaking of non
reference cards we did a really cool
episode of NCIS tech tips today um oh
I'm gonna eat a pickle off screen
because someone sent me a very kindly
worded email last week they asked me not
to eat pickles on camera but I'm hungry
and I haven't eaten much today pickles
I'm gonna go green but off camera yeah
they're probably gonna try and interject
and what I'm saying no no I don't get a
type of busy you're gonna cover it
adequately this time when you're fired
my brain hurts
I said a headed so what we did was we
took a 650 Ti boost and pitted it
against a 60 650 TI boost overclocked
edition from MSI and pitted against a
reference card from EVGA s660 so two
different GPUs one is a step behind but
overclocked from the factory and one is
a step ahead but not over collect for
the factory and unlike how we do it at
linus tech tips or we just overclocked
everything it was n TX tech tips so
neither were overclocked by us there was
one those overclock fun factory and the
one that wasn't and the one that wasn't
was a 660 and the one that was with 660
Ti boost 650 TI boost sorry um we then
played or was it crisis too far cry 3
and which or two actually anyways I'm
not going to get into that cuz I'm not
sure what else to say but um but yeah we
did those three caves and then pitted
them against each other and I don't even
know what the result was which is one
reason why I have to interject because
remember through the only one that has
the numbers for this okay well I'm
almost done my pickle you're still
eating a pickle on the stream then um
okay you were doing when you under sorry
alright so results wise it was really
interesting because I have a lot of
people ask me which you know 660ti
should I get and the answer is unless
you're buying the cheapest one get a 670
okay which 650 TI boost should I get the
cheapest one or get a 660 because even
though the 650 TI was overclocked from
the factory are 660 or just a 6 even
though that see this is so confusing
even though the 650 TI boost was
overclocked from the factory are 660
vanilla reference bone stock card
outperformed it by ten percent while
being only ten bucks more expensive so
that's a five percent difference in
price for a ten percent difference in
performance now here's something that
you guys need to understand about
overclocking Headroom reference cards vs
non reference cards sometimes a
reference card will have X amount of
overclocking Headroom over the stock
reference clock and then a non reference
card will have
I amount of overclocking Headroom but
it's not like it overclocks tried three
times as much it doesn't work that way
it's a GPU limitation so if it
overclocks a little bit more then it
might get a slightly higher you know
factory clock but that ceiling is still
pretty close so that reference card
hasn't been overclocked yet meaning that
okay so we got our 652 like let's say
the gap is like this and our 650 Ti
boost makes it to hear because it has a
factory overclock but there's still a
ten percent Delta okay that doesn't mean
that both of these cards can still
overclock this much and the difference
will always be like that this one has
had some of its overclocking Headroom
used up so might make it this much
further whereas this has used no
overclocking Headroom it can go this
much further but maybe not quite this
much further so the difference in
performance I know this isn't a very
good visual but the point is that you
have a certain amount of overclocking
Headroom if they use it up at the
factory they used it up at the factory
there's not like you couldn't have taken
a reference card and overclocked it to
where that factory OC card is sometimes
there is a bidding process something
like an EVGA classified card something
like an a sous Ares level card something
like an ROG card matrix card they are
bidding those they are making sure that
those are the most overclockable GPUs
are matrix 7970 was a beast destroyed
everything single GPU that we've seen
today other than the titan absolute
beast so unless but these mildly
overclocked cards you know like a super
clock or a super clock plus I would be
looking more into other things if you're
getting a stir market cooler instead of
reference cooler like audio levels you
know ya better temperatures if you're
specifically really really want low
temperatures um looks looks stuff like
that so if those are your factors then
okay while means look at a lower tier
card that has other features that you
appreciate maybe you want different
connectors on the back yeah this is
something to consider but if you're
thinking gaming performance by a better
card that's it same thing for dual GPU
but a better card or recording yourself
to 650 Ti boost source
670 by a 670 single GPU card and buy the
best GPU you can afford so there that
was my lecture on that there's there's
weird kind of there's exceptions this is
if since the rule yes like 650 TI hawk
from yes our edition from MSI when that
first release was a better deal than a
670 but then now things have changed
yeah but now it's been nerfed a little
bit so but like yeah there's slight
exception to the rule but that's usually
just kind of how it goes and there are
other exceptions to the rule so some
such as 670 versus 680 a factory
overclocked 670 can get pretty darn
close to 680 of performance 680 does
cost a lot more in a lot of cases
especially once you get to the higher
tier cards the rules start to change so
usually the best bang for the buck while
the best extreme performance bang for
the buck is the second one down so as
long as it's based on the same GPU as
the high-end one a lot of the time
you'll get very similar frequencies but
it'll have some some cuda cores some SMX
units some stream processors whatever
they happen to be called it will have
some disabled so it'll be slightly lower
performance but it'll be darn close as
long as you've got enough vram then it's
often better to go with that option
versus the higher end card but I still
wouldn't spend four hundred dollars on
you know a 660 ti if that'll get me a
670 no matter what no matter how OC and
like you know goober it is the only
thing I'll worry about at that point is
like what I'm doing with my bill but if
I'm buying a four-hundred-dollar card
I'm hoping a motor yeah yeah I got okay
water cooling is another one has then
that won't show the if I don't like a
reference cooler that won't show the
reference cooler sorry American
schoolers like the Titan I kind of want
to leave that cuz that reference me cuz
sauce like I don't want to change the
reference cooler I almost don't even
want to water cool it I just want to
leave it how it is because it looks so
good um we should almost maybe cool it
with our what'swhat's to deal with the
after party this week I don't know
that's a deal because we've got 25
minutes left oh let's do our let's do
our news items from the forum of the
week and let's do our build logs of the
week and all that kind of stuff
then yeah are we gonna talk about the
forum in general on the after party
orders yeah let's move that to have to
party okay so let's do our so community
news items guys the lightest tech tips
forum is awesome now now finally it's
actually awesome here you here okay you
know what let's let's do okay are you
ready for this oh no I'm not ready for
this okay I have a feeling oh god
everyone go to Linus tech tips calm
right now let's see what happens let's
see cease looks doing it give into peer
pressure linus tech tips com go go go go
go go i think it doesn't care will it
handle it so we are at a we are at a
hosting service now it is no longer
being hosted at NCIX so bandwidth is no
longer as much of a concern now when we
first were hosting it at NCIX bandwidth
wasn't the issue the issue was actually
caused by vbulletin inefficiencies
compared to what we're using now which
is IPS so then by the time vbulletin
started to get a little bit more
efficient on NCIX move a lot of their
operation okay well crashed fine so it
looks like it can only handle so much so
um oh it's holding though it made it
okay NCIX moved part of their operation
to the place where we were hosting and
they had to throttle our internet
connection so we only had about 25
megabit up so now we have about 800
megabit up and instead of the homemade
server that we were using before Oh 1400
users online thanks guys you guys are
awesome and instead of the day I can't
believe that page even refreshed ah ok I
gotta do a shout-out thank you mod team
in general for helping me over like the
three days that I didn't sleep Thank You
mr. wizard for just like hauling the
forum into existence because there was
no other way that was happening and
thank you win speed for the current
hosting situation yeah that one of our
modern all of those things coming like
without all the mods coming in and
helping me without mr. wizard like just
championing the entire thing without IPS
making that converter actually work got
there was so many groups
actually we didn't want to promise
anything cuz we weren't sure if all
these stars were gonna align especially
other things that had gone wrong up till
now yeah and there was like there was a
lot of stuff that actually made this
possible so thanks everybody that helped
me over the last little while actually
make this house so we're running on an
octa-core server with 32 gigs of ram
with 800 megabit up and we're on a
proper hosting service now guys close
welcome to the forum the forum is
awesome it's been super active like I
don't know how often you click the view
new content button up at the top right
holy crap guys honestly I've spent the
last three days in the control panel if
you have a question like I I've started
posting honestly I was at the point
where I was frustrated routine with the
old forum I couldn't even use I was
pretty much only operating through pms
yeah I mean at this point I am me I'm
finding this the most enjoyable form
I've ever been a member of because I
look at any question and like even if I
try to ninja and get in there and like
be the first one to answer I can't be
and people are friendly with one thing
that I actually really like and I've you
know what I mean I'm gonna be making a
point and you should too and guys we all
should of keeping the community friendly
I don't want to see like let me google
that for you links I don't want to see
this should be obvious to you I don't
want to see any kind of put-downs
because I want linus tech tips forum to
be the place where people can go and
have a friendly discussion even if they
don't understand the topic and you know
obviously obvious troll is obvious is
going to happen from time to time let
the moderation team deal with it flag it
they're going to go just a problem there
are moderation teams good we now
actually have a report system that works
ha before I know it just popped up and i
and i like and i moderated something and
it just worked yeah i was like what ya
gotta be getting so before the report
system before people that reported
before thank you yeah that helps but the
only person doing it was me so it was
really really hard to keep up with that
many reports and those of you who sent
me pm's before my inbox has been broken
for weeks I'm sorry like I wanted to
reply to you he actually was not able to
I typed up replies like this long and
I'd click send and it just oh okay oh
that's good just this beer so now the PM
system is properly working yeah one lost
their pms I'm so
sorry if I gave if I gave invision power
services more time they would have made
it work but we wanted the forum going I
did not give them enough time they gave
me like the files and they're like this
might work for most things probably
maybe and I was like all right we're
doing it so because it worked enough
attachments kind of broke PM's don't
exist anymore signatures kind of broke a
little bit like there's there's a few
things that broke but for the most part
it's working fine and we have almost
1800 years or something there's no way
the V bowls and form would have handled
it no way this it could there's no way
it's not nearly efficient enough no and
our old server couldn't our old cpu used
to max out at a hundred percent cpu load
at times during the day with like 300
people look like 300 people on whereas
now we have 1700 people on i think you
said we had 300 people on before and it
was like three percent cpu yeah it just
doesn't kids just so much more efficient
right now but I guys yeah welcome to the
forum ask your questions we're trying to
create a friendly community ask some
questions answer some questions have
some fun um you know join the community
it's all good it's all good things so
you know thank you guys for hanging
weight hanging in there with us yeah I
mean we are like okay I'm gonna directly
call it a random four-member ghost hello
I don't even know if you watched the
farms um he was a huge massive poster
like when I sent unreachable like
getting huge I posted ton people yeah
and his post count started rotting and
for no reason likely Bothans just a jerk
and started taking post count away from
him no idea why and like like everything
else broke so he's like yo I'm just
gonna wait and I'll come back later he's
back yeah that's awesome he came back
like the minute that we launched the new
form like cuz we felt bad we're like
these people are trying to contribute
and help us build a community here and
we appreciate it and we're not giving
them a good enough platform yeah and
like I used ghosts but he wasn't the
only case of that yeah and like it's one
of those things where it's like the
people in this room here lost sleep over
that bad situation a lot of sleep so you
know yeah thank you guys for hanging in
there with us and we're proud to deliver
you a platform that actually works now
and also proud to see that we
have 2,900 live viewers right now this
is one of our biggest live streams ever
so yeah thank you guys so much for for
coming in and hanging out with us so
let's do our community news items we
want the new section of linus tech tips
forum to be like awesome we want it to
be up to date and we want one of the
ways that we can help you guys you know
feel great about contributing to be that
we will call you out on the live stream
and let you know that things are that
your posts are awesome and they are
appreciated so we have member mono here
who posted a pc / article about AMD
improving crossfire performance with a
prototype driver now it just so happens
that I was sitting right next to ryan's
row from pc / as he was writing this
hard cool because i was at an asus
conference and he happened to be there
as well that was about intel's upcoming
Haswell cpus and he suits motherboards
that'll go with them and the ecosystem
that goes around it so i was looking
over a shoulder i was like damn i'm
looking at what you got here right what
you got here what you got here ryan and
he's like dude I'm trying to write an
article like yeah yeah what you got what
you got it was actually awesome this is
the first time I met Ryan in person
super cool guy we didn't get much of a
chance to hang out because we weren't
there very long but um but anyway he was
showing me um obviously I didn't have to
rely on YouTube anyway big thanks to
mono for contributing this this topic he
was showing me I didn't have to watch
youtube links he had it all locally on
his computer which was great side by
sides of how there was so much more
visual pairing in the release driver and
then the prototype driver guys this
prototype driver is probably six to ten
weeks from a natalie is not the beta
drivers yes it is not the currently
downloadable day knows it is a prototype
it's a completely different thing it's
not even based on the current 13.5 it's
based on an older like 12 points
something driver if i recall correctly I
don't know that okay but it's based on
an old-ass driver yeah and I'm in I yeah
I wasn't saying you're wrong yeah I have
no information ya know so it's based on
an old driver but it is addressing
the the frame time differences which can
cause AMD crossfirex solutions to have
high frame rates but choppy actual
perceived performance that's what it's
causing right now and this prototype
driver hasn't made it as good as in
video solution yet because NVIDIA has
hardware that takes care of this but
it's a software fix that makes it look
way better so it's basically taking
games that are already optimized for the
card on crappier older drivers not
crappier but you know older less
optimized drivers throwing in this frame
time smoothing algorithm and bringing it
up to twenty percent better than a much
newer much more optimized per game
driver so the future is bright for
crossfire owners however his conclusion
in the review which is what I think he
was writing when I was standing over him
was okay that still doesn't mean i can
recommend the 7990 because it comes with
a butt ton of games and this is all good
eight games but the gaming experience
today what you get for a thousand
dollars today is not what this prototype
driver is that won't be available for a
while and when the driver comes with the
fix we'll look at it again but it's not
there yet and I think that's a very fair
and honest conclusion so anyway it was
it was cool to sort of stand over and
have them explained in person it's one
thing to read a review from a from you
know a highly technical author it's
another to sit next to them while
they're writing the article and have
them explain their thought processes
every word goes onto the page so it was
very cool big shout-out to ryan at pc /
on twitter so guys go go say hi to Ryan
because apparently I can just say go to
a website and you guys will do it you
guys are awesome so go say hi to Ryan
let's like flood is Twitter right now at
p CP ER at pc / thanks Ryan for hanging
out with minus minus thinks your coo coo
you can leave off the l yeah leave aqua
l- thinks you're cute you can put an
apostrophe though yeah alright so one of
the other community news items was
actually something we covered already
but i want to give credit where credit
is due to our forum contributors Josie
is the one who posted this article with
this picture showing an HTC one with the
remove
double back that shows microSD expansion
and dual sim expansions so that is the
Chinese model and I want one I didn't
realize how big the removable back was I
wonder if this means that super
technical people maybe with special
screwdrivers or something it's a
different phone different internals are
going to be able to give insight into
the battery no no no because it's a
unibody back on the North American model
and no Adam is still a battery is still
non removable and based on the tooling
process of this phone the sandwich
construction there's no way to get in
there holy okay cuz like people like I
fix it or whatever they're cold they
usually find ways even when people say
it's not yeah they can find I just I
really doubt it it's built so solidly I
know I'm not I'm not like you might be
able to you might be able to take it
apart but I can't imagine you ever be
able to put it back together with the
same fit and finish that it has right
and that's not that's a thing oh of
course yeah um okay and then our next
one is from that that that uh oh I'm
really excited about this so you guys
know okay while I might not be Oh Josie
again you're on a roll a sous introduces
external DAC with 120 decibel sound to
noise ratio 600 ohm headphone amp and
swappable op amps the essence st you
know nothing about price absolutely
nothing about price which is like okay
thanks hey soos because this doesn't
tell me how it compares to something
like an essence 1 yeah or an essence 1
Musa dition no idea because the essence
1 is an external back with a headphone
amp that's capable of driving 600 ohm
headphones a musician is like slight
improvement on that this looks like it
might be slightly lower end than essence
1 uh essence one looks like i had more
stuff yeah slightly more features here
if we just kind of control plus this so
you guys can check it out as well it
looks classier in my opinion very classy
looking the essence one has kind of like
like a weird industrial design that's
kind of unusual yeah this looks like a
piece of audio equipment it was very
cool yeah um so and the thing that ok
the thing that the two things that
confuse me about this are that they're
calling it audiophile grade which audio
files are the only ones who are allowed
to call something
bo file great a lot of the time yeah
it's like it's part of the it's that's a
thing where they called the last one
audio fella great as well be dead but
it's it also says so sort of bringing
like the quality of an essence st or STX
to an external unit but offers even more
premium audio quality plus easy controls
and connectivity to notebooks so what is
it is it something like an sts TX zentz
class card in an external box which has
advantages so reduced interference as
well as the clean signal that is USB as
well as being able to plug it into a
notebook or is it i even higher end
solution i don't quite know but i'm
really excited to try it out yeah that's
to be really cool i hope we get it happy
good one I hope we get one if anyone
from isus is watching speaking of if
anyone from blackberry is watching which
I said before we have a contact at
blackberry now z10 coming q10 coming
later so I am going to be doing a
blackberry i switched hopefully like
people just keep on releasing random
phones yeah just never get to stop doing
i switched they tried to deliver it
today oh really but no one was here so
it'll be it'll come on monday z10 is
coming so once i finish android and then
once i finish I'm like how am I gonna do
all this good maybe we should have you
do the blackberry i switched identity be
okay you're a hardcore android guy this
is interesting guys hit add slick pc on
twitter and let him know what you think
asked like pc on twitter right there
actually that's his that's his penis but
sort of like the overlay that's covering
that um hit at slick pc on twitter and
let him know if you think he should be
the one to host the blackberry i
switched so of course now i'm gonna have
to do it well I'm kind of interested in
biker they might not want you to so
which one is the one that has the
keyboard on it that's a cute n so cute n
is coming probably a few weeks later or
something I would rather try that one
you should try both sure so it should be
you have to have the touchscreen
blackberry 10 experience and the buttons
while experiencing or something
something like that would make a ton of
sense and would really educate people
not only about the black bb10 xperia
but also which of these two flagship
grade phones is actually better for me
right so yeah I'll be interesting so
he's an s3 user yeah it'll be like what
it'll be what will it be like to go from
this mature platform this mature handset
don't tell us yeah like new platform and
I've been like I've had my ass3 for a
while now and I'm very comfortable with
my current configuration let me tell you
going from comfort zone to new phone
platform which is why like I'm excited
to try new things but at the same time
I'm like ah all the things that just
were I know my s3 I'd like really know
my s3 all right so we've got a couple
more things guys we want you to post
your build logs in the linus tech tips
forum because build logs are fun for
people to look at they are fun for what
seriously he's this is the case of the
oh this is the case okay so we got a big
shout out for a tasty pctv tasty pc TV
on youtube that's the girl with the duck
face that does videos on the YouTube and
I think she I think her bill was black
and red and his built Bukka Reddy okay
so he posted her her video yeah um um i
forget what i was saying yeah we want
you guys to post your your builds and
because people love seeing your builds
people love commenting on builds i think
people love having others comment on
their builds so here we've got quite the
GPU lineup here that looks like a couple
of my 80s or 6 80's you didn't end up
using all those didn't end up using all
what I don't need way to index I did not
have time I'm sorry this this week's
live stream was crazy because we had to
try and figure everything out um but
like he gets down into it pictures start
coming pretty quick all right see I like
this I've done this before where are you
Anthony yeah mixing and matching the
ramp see how the ram sticks match the
dim slot nice little touches like that I
like it yeah yeah I truly like the
hundred percent approve of this the only
time I usually go against that is with
super clean finish Ram like I original
dominators mm-hmm and uh muskan silver
lines the old ones they're gonna just
said muskan on it yeah like a full set
of that looked so good that's true so
good but remember not one
with the to kingston sticks and the to a
neon sticks where they had a similar
style of spreader but they were
alternate colors blue and black yeah all
that looks see like that looks really
cool yeah yeah for sure all right uh
yeah taking apart the graphics card that
must be a Titan gk110 yeah look at all
dem ram that ran so he works at a
computer shot okay I don't know if this
was for a customer or not I just
remember he works at the computer shop
he got of course they're late to work so
yeah so kudos ah that back mounted SSD
love that very cool very just very clean
no ax 860 looks like that was colored oh
no unless it's an 860 I in which case it
should be red can't tell can't tell from
here okay it's very nice when directly
into the sort nice water cooling is very
possible wait is that it STX ah maybe
power go to that not sure yeah it might
come later he hasn't got everything
wired up yet very nice sleeved very nice
leave cables very nice Sibley's used um
a little bidding cr2 yeah that's what it
just gets down under those cables like
looks very good makes it look much more
clean i'm too cheap to buy angled
fittings personally but it definitely
planned it out yes nice planning makes a
build look so much stronger yeah um not
the best photography skills I've ever
seen but I don't think we should
penalize but it can also be like a phone
yeah that's it probably is based on how
much noise there isn't the images yeah
so don't worry alphacool zuber thick
radiator look at that thing that's so
see that's how big a g1 quarter fitting
is there guys love it absolutely love it
so here's what the moment was like good
in its native environment very very nice
love that microphone setup that is what
this is the kind of thing that diesel
was using where he had like diesel had
like a pro grade like studio recording
microphone that he was using for voice
chatting games like screw seeing my
third monitor it's like we care yeah I'm
too good for that like to lead that's
awesome so yeah featured build this week
I didn't even catch the name I'm sorry
Kenny six great job we've got featured
projects banana phones all right I'm
gonna let you walk through this one I'm
gonna have the last person I go don't
I have to use this little tiny keyboard
I'm eating my pickle dizzy oh sorry guys
this is might actually they got paper
down on current page where is it there
we go that's not working that's still
not working that's now working okay so
using our for i'm gonna skip through
these pretty quick because it's fairly
basic stuff until we kind of get to the
second page he's just showing whoa he
strips it and then he paints the back so
it's white because it's an hour for
gorgeous so he's matching the other
slots nice that's really cool yep those
little touches maybe all the difference
um and like he had to take a shower he
could get to properly right right so it
makes sense so that is great and looks
really cool huh because there's like you
don't see that oh I wanted to do it but
then I was just lazy and busy God is
back plate do so here's like a in
progress shot the guns cars not in there
yet a lot of stuff isn't in there yeah
for like an AMD build yeah that's
another reason why I want to bring it on
I don't think we've had one yet yeah I
think we've had one yet um so that's
kind of cool this is funny cuz I got
trashed so hard for saying something
like the majority of enthusiasts gaming
builds our Intel and it's just like guys
I don't make the rules people goal why
this is until fanboy he said them joy
it's like no it's just if the numbers
are just kind of there yeah I don't know
what what you want from us these are
people quoting his post so I got a
little bit confused by this but as
people quoting his post so you see the
same picture like a billion times I love
that back rounded SS mind you the way
they do that in the r4 is not my
favorite you have to take the
motherboard off to be able to take it
off or put it on yeah just kind of her
cuz you have to screw in from the moment
see you he's gesturing to the camera I
talk with my hands leave alone uh so
Jamaica's cables look nice you use
extensions which is a really good way to
go save money and time because it looks
just as good on this angle except you
can see them coming from the power
supply but like where you're mainly
looking it looks just as good from this
angle so this is a slightly in progress
shot you can kind of see um the PCI crap
it like the back that we painted it
where it's white looks great matches
everything
there's a better shot of that you should
gesture with the mouse as opposed to
with your hand I know that's myself crap
I'm really not good at using this whole
tank you would there you go wait what
the mouse not your hand where is it why
okay I'm just gonna take over okay why
don't you talk but I'll just direct it
okay so guys right there that's the
light John we've seen that yeah okay can
definitely go down oh okay there's a
we've kind of seen that shoulder ready
yeah some items and shot to the hard way
Johnny's got a cpu cooler and go down
though thanks to you have blocked CPU
justly or page two who even poses a
pornstar cpu cooler hmm okay he's a liar
oh there we go that's more like it holds
you okay hey guard city starts his water
cleaning solution so really long runs
one thing I was interested in is if you
could flip the radiator over I know
looking at clearance maybe because of
the ports that it might not fit but
there might be some type of custom
modding maybe point with the mouse yeah
ok so the radiator here maybe some type
of custom modding that he could do to
take that bracket off right there and
then he might actually be able to fit
the radiator the other way around the
advantage of turning the radiator the
other way is also that it enables it to
bleed the air bubbles out much more
easily because they'll naturally go to
the top where the holes will be yeah and
then like like so way shorter runs sort
of look cleaner yeah and then a natural
bleeding like he just said so that's
actually that would be nice I'm thinking
what he did was he put it the other way
and it didn't fit but if I could find
some way to take Gazette's for hard
drive cages right if you could just find
some way to take that off yeah without
like damaging everything is it possible
that he could add a GPU block in the
future then this run would make more
sense so then that's even yep but angry
true there we go still very
clean-looking looks nice it's just the
runs could be shorter which is I don't
know it's not yeah it's not the biggest
deal but it looks really add looks
really good very attainable build and so
that is that is a build from Antarctic
cash that is the that is the strangest
that is the strangest name that I think
that I've seen on the floor you sure
those the poster check to you because
those are quotes that you yep antarctic
cash okay
cool there you go that looks so good not
okay with the colored back oh my god is
good all right so let's go back to our
back to our regular view of the live
stream and I think that pretty much oh
it's it's 530 can you it's like it look
it's like there's light outside and
we're done the live stream isn't this
weird done yeah well done after parties
coming later so I had a quite a few
people complain that they don't want
after party to not be uploaded to
YouTube so I'm thinking after party goes
on YouTube with a link in the
description of the regular livestream
and it'll be an unlisted video but you
can click the link in the description
you can watch after party should you so
desire so that is it for the linus tech
tips live stream for this week we'll see
you guys next week and we'll be back in
just a moment with some after party
action where it's less structure i can't
imagine it being less structured than
what we just did same time next week 4
p.m. yeah yeah this time guys put it in
your calendar I can't believe how many
people ask me every week when the live
stream is it could be first-time viewers
you don't know know sometimes it's the
same guys I've like seen this happen and
you know what's funny as I've never
changed that I've changed the time once
now this is the first day since I
started it it's been a 9 p.m. friday
night now we're moving to 4 p.m. friday
afternoon and i think this is gonna work
I think that's gonna work look how many
people tuned in today it's a way better
time since it's a way better time so
it's unfortunate for the people who
can't watch now but overall it's way
better time so I will see you guys next
week thanks for thanks for tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
