pretty much everyone has let's say
noticed Intel's consumer divisions tick
tick tick tick eventually talk approach
to generational performance improvements
including folks at AMD but then on the
surface
AMD seems to have pulled a page right
out of Intel's playbook with their
second-generation
AMD rise in desktop processors but is
there more to these than meets the eye
well I'm gonna let you know after this
painful segue to our sponsor private
internet access private Internet access
is the VPN service that encrypts all of
your internet traffic and use a safe
protected IP it's got tons of other
useful features and you can check it out
at the link below
so what's the deal here is AMD replacing
rise in three risin five and risin seven
with risin - mmm
not quite while these are second
generation the risin seven 2700 X and
the rise in five 2600 X clocking in at
eight and six course respectively are
not technically as n - that's not going
to come until later so what we're
getting now are higher boost clocks with
XF are applying to all cores and this
one's pretty exciting up to a 34 percent
improvement to cache latency with AMD
claiming a theoretical three percent
performance bump from that second point
alone we're also getting up to
dual-channel ddr2 933 support on the
brand-new x4 70 chipset motherboards
which from even our early testing
translates into much better
compatibility with high-speed memory
kits so all of this adds up to something
that AMD is calling Zen + based on a
tweaked 12 nanometer process that's been
fine-tuned to push rated clock speeds
higher without increasing the rated
power consumption now of course we're
gonna have to test all these claims so
while we wait for this to rise
it's a yeast joke let's go over our test
setup we'll be using both Intel's latest
and AMD's previous gen consumer
processors which it's done already go
ahead and cut oh my god this joke is so
I'm sorry that whole thing with the oven
was just a lead-in to a joke about mmm
delicious rise in crust why don't we
just get into the benchmarks starting
with our gaming stuff
yes more terrible puns how surprising
Rison second-gen is ever so slightly
faster than risin first-gen Deus Ex
mankind divided barely cared far cry 5
actually got five to seven more fps and
csgo actually this one was a standout
very nice the differences though are
less noticeable in 3d mark and Unigine
superposition putting second gen close
enough that we technically observed
higher numbers on our first gen chips
and of course when it comes to gaming
intel still steals the show now let's
move on to productivity here things take
a more dramatic swing so our 2700 X
absolutely creams the last gen 1800 X in
our testing with significantly higher
scores in Cinebench and Asus reel bench
and shaving a cool 1 minute 11 seconds
off the classroom render time in blender
the 1800 X already beat out the core i7
8700 K and most of these so the gap then
is that much wider this time around
impressive and it looks like at least
some of this is due to the improvements
to cache latency with our testing a
knight of 64 showing a pretty
significant improvement of around 25%
with higher bandwidth and improved
memory latency to boot of course what
would a review of a new CPU be without
overclocking results let's go to level 3
bad so our 2600 X still didn't want to
play a ball with our pre-release
firmware but our 2,700 X with the auto
tweak feature gave us predictably better
results although these games are mainly
limited to highly threaded workloads
lightly threaded or gaming workloads
understandably actually suffer slightly
compared to the 100 megahertz faster
stock XF our clocks power consumption is
still higher than coffee lake but that's
not really a surprise what is
interesting is that
under load our new chips are more
power-hungry we think because precision
boosts to is keeping the CPU at higher
speeds more often this also translates
into higher temperatures which means we
wouldn't really recommend doing a ton of
overclocking with your stock cooler as
cool as the new wraith max RGB coolers
might be so then at 3:29 for the
high-end verizon 720 700 x and 229 for
the six core rise in 520 600 X both of
them $30 more than their non x
counterparts AMD has managed to claw
back a bit of the bang for the buck
proposition that they enjoyed with rise
ins first generation release and perhaps
more importantly even though this is a
new CPU and chipset the obvious
stability issues with high-speed memory
in particular that prevented us from
making a clear recommendation last time
around argon so let's not kid ourselves
this is every bit as incremental as
Intel's move from skylake to KB Lake and
we are disappointed that it's not Zen to
yet but second generation Rison is a bit
more worth your money than last time
which is a good thing you know what else
is a good thing mass drop the concept is
pretty simple to understand the more
people who commit to purchasing a
certain product the lower the price of
that product goes and today we're
talking about the AKG K 7 xx configured
by mass drop these are open backed
headphones with large cushy ear cups
that have been tweets to deliver a wide
locationally specific soundstage that
puts you closer to the source they
feature a genuine leather headband
memory foam ear pads with velu are
covering a two-year warranty service by
AKG and they ship out in two to three
days so check them out at the link below
