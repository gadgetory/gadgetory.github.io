by the D brand grip and prism screen
protector you can check them out at the
link in the video description so we're
here in the LG booth where they actually
downplayed the kind of monitor stuff
they were showing off they were like oh
yeah I don't really know if we have that
much this year but some of this stuff
even though it's iterative improvements
is actually a big difference over what
we've seen before so first of all we've
got the ultrawide monitor curve for 9 WL
9 v seen it's a lot cooler than it
sounds so just like samsung's recent 49
inch very very wide what are these like
32 by 9 aspect ratio yeah 32 by 9 aspect
ratio display it's really really wide
it's curved and it's optimized for kind
of a combination I guess of productivity
and/or super immersive gaming but unlike
Samsung's instead of being limited to a
1080 vertical resolution which means
that the entire image looked kind of
grainy LG has gone one better and
they've delivered a 50 120 by 1440
resolution on this thing so the image is
much much finer now this means for
gamers you're gonna have a pretty hard
time driving it because this is
effectively kind of a shortened 5k
monitor but frankly you won't be worried
about that anyway because it only runs
at 60 Hertz but there's good news I was
gonna walk out of the frame but sure we
can work with this this is the 38 GL 950
G and this is a whole other ball of wax
now I had given LG a hard time in the
past for selling gaming monitors that
didn't have support for in videos g-sync
and here they are their timing is
impeccable right as Nvidia announced
that regular adaptive sync displays can
run G sync now LG's here with the G sync
module in their monitor but that's not
to say that having a g-sync module is
pointless even now because it means that
you've got a very very wide variable
refresh rate window
means you've got support for adaptive
pixel overdrive so you're not gonna get
more or less smearing depending on the
refresh rate of the display and in this
case it means because they're using the
module they can drive this thing at 38
40 by 1600 which is the same as the 38
inch ultra wide that's on my desk except
that instead of 75 Hertz they have
nearly doubled that to a hundred and
forty-four Hertz native and it can
actually overclock to 175 now all of
that is with a nano IPS panel that means
98% DCI p3 color gamut coverage like
this thing is basically best of all
worlds that I can really identify oh and
if you're into it it's got this reactive
lighting thing that goes on that you can
either have sync up with your video or
your audio or with the download you can
set it to just like some color if you
want now it's not coming anytime soon
they have no pricing information for us
whatsoever but hey the future is now
later bringing us somewhat awkwardly and
abruptly to this thing so the only notes
I have about the 38 CK 950 N is that
there's no pricing available at this
time that's pretty much all I got I'm
gonna have to wing the rest of this this
is a weird there's a weird product okay
so this is what is it 38 40 by 1600 yeah
that's right it's got a webcam built
into it right up there at the top it's
60 Hertz so you know nothing
groundbreaking as far as that goes so
this is just like the monitor on my desk
except that it's got a computer built
into it so it's got a rise in three APU
with eight gigs of RAM 128 gigs of SSD
storage and like no OS pre-installed on
it it seems to be like kind of a
business-to-business play but it's like
backwards normally you'd have the system
division slap a display on a computer
and in this case we've got the monitor
division slapping a computer into a
display so it's like I don't know let me
know in the comments below
what is this why do you think it exists
I'd love to hear from you there's one
thing that I can tell you why it exists
though and that is the d-brane grip it's
a super grippy case with precision
cutouts for your camera your fingerprint
sensor it's got super clicky buttons and
of course it's deep brand
so you can customize the look with any
of their fabulous debrand skins and
they're also promoting their prism
screen protector this thing it's not
actually on this phone but don't worry
about that this thing is unbelievable so
they've got a cool little applicator
that makes it so you get a perfect
application every time it feels really
glassy from the front nothing about this
demo is staged
I was absolutely dumbstruck so check out
both the grip and the prism at the link
in the video description and we will see
you guys at the next CES booth hey come
on I'm trying to
all right I guess there's the gram but
there's new grams this one looks pretty
cool we're gonna review it really soon
our review units like in the mail
