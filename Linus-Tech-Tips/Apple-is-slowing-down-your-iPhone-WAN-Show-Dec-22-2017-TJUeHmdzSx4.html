we've got a great show for you guys
today you seem hesitant we don't have a
great show for them well we had a bad
show we have we have intent fairly
intense news I know right yeah so it
turns out Apple is slowing down your old
iPhone well except for those of you who
are like ha ha joke's on you I don't
have an iPhone
except for you Apple cannot slow down
your iPhone but they can slow down your
friends iPhone so you should still care
about this we'll talk about it a little
more later
Intel CEO Brian krzanich came out and
said we are going to take more risks so
basically in time they're becoming
they're gonna get into a big like the
energy drink sector noise and they're
gonna start they're gonna have a new
slogan Intel we want to be inside you
right now I can't get into the dock but
good news yeah Facebook strikes a music
deal with Universal I guess great news
because we needed another music
streaming platform yeah I don't want
another thing to subscribe to okay I'm
actually sick okay this is about to get
really bad okay so Taylor Swift's album
hold on just for that you know I'll talk
about it later
I'm also magic leap magic lead finally
has a product yes you ordered it I well
I signed up you can't order it yeah so I
signed up so I'm expecting you know 10
years might show us so we'll talk about
the ultimate secrecy freaking these guys
are ridiculous I don't know how they got
funding because they didn't they've
never shown anything no they have only
behind yes yes yes like MD eight
literally up the rectum yeah so no one's
ever no one knows what's going into
inside
okay
does that work for everybody
great Squarespace is that cool for folks
okay we could just yell all showing I'm
down
yeah I'm down to down to yell all show
apparently rip rip ears rip ears oh
sorry everyone
apparently it got louder so I have no
idea what you people are talking about
that's a global audio settings okay so
why don't we get into our first topic
Apple this is supposed to by dr.
McIntosh Wawa on the forum the original
article that we have here is from Yahoo
Finance it's posted into it Jen okay
that's an odd one I don't think I have
actually which which one have we tested
is that is that the look one or is that
though do we do we have any idea this
one works I believe that one works I
think okay let's so about a week ago a
massively popular and widely circulated
thread on reddit posited that Apple
purposely slows down performance on
iPhones with older a batteries which
people have been thinking for kind of
ever yeah but now we've been able to you
know so in a nutshell iPhone users have
noticed their older phones not
performing as well as they did before
iOS 10 2.1 but they've also noticed that
performance can increase after getting a
new battery so it turns out that Apple
has admitted that they are intentionally
gating the amount of power that the CPU
demands from the battery this is because
the phone will shut down to protect
itself if the CPU demands more power
than it can supply so there are three
scenarios where batteries are less
likely to be able to produce the big
bursts of power that the CPU might ask
for when they're cold
when they're low and when the battery
has degraded over time so what this
means is that right out of the box you
might run into a situation where your
cpu effectively throttles for a reason
other than thermals except that it could
be thermals but cold thermals not hot
thermals yes the third reason means that
out of out of a hundred iPhones how many
of them will slow down 100 a hundred
yeah because if it will throttle
once the battery decays I shouldn't say
decays degrades degrade they don't
necessarily decay I mean they if you put
enough like if you put enough chicken
soup on them they could probably decay
do you remember that old camera we used
to use for tech tips videos line
defectives videos that I got the chicken
soup on yeah that decayed oh yeah Wow
yeah because it was in my backpack for
like over a span of a week I didn't
realize yeah
chicken soup I don't know what actually
decayed well it smelled the soup yes I
don't know the the contacts in the
battery compartment were like corroded
and stuff okay that make sense it's
still not decay like when's your last
day it like slightly over we yeah like
just just over a week perfect perfect
can't come soon enough
well I'll get to two days I'll get to
put down that piece of tape that will
make it totally different yeah before
yeah you'll be working and you'll be
working in a separate office office yeah
all by myself while I talk to people
over the internet marked by the masking
tape your office yeah and I won't have
to be in it except when I have to meet
with you oh oh oh we should talk about
flow playing stuff on the show come on
oh but see every single time that this
happens people get confused despite no
matter how many times I say this isn't
the site you're supposed to be using
everyone goes to go use it okay also you
never actually ended up telling all the
editors that they're supposed to upload
things in a certain way and use that
setting
so it hasn't been being used so there's
things that aren't supposed to be viewed
yet on there and you're not gonna tell
them until next week and then you'll
probably forget so it's really not up to
you I'll think about it how people are
gonna be seeing videos with the wrong
titles I think about it I think anyway
slow playing lot of things going great
we have a new live stream panel things
set up so and yes I did
he's not streaming till later tonight
talk about that later you know what
we're doing it okay we're going through
the thing cuz I'm gonna end I'm an okay
anyway so starting with iOS 10.2 dot one
Mac CPU power drawers steps down in
proportion to battery capability it's
not just like uh like your batteries
good so your phone runs at full speed or
your battery is okay that's what Chad's
really confused about me leaving might
want to explain that okay starting
January first alright alright okay can I
finish the Apple battery thing and then
can we get in we'll come back to they'll
come back to it's not comebacks not that
scary it's a little scary I'm scared I
mean it's are you a little scared it
throws me off pretty hard yeah but we'll
talk about it okay okay anyway anyway so
so it's not a matter of like your
battery's good or your battery's bad so
your performance is like great or your
firm's like poo yeah it's it's it's like
it's a spectrum you know so this was
originally applied to the iPhone se e6
and has now been applied to the iPhone 7
and the 6s and it's being planned for
future devices so part of the problem
though okay bla they could have bricked
the phones up front instead of breaking
the mere after launch then they wouldn't
be as impressive in competitive okay you
know what let's let's get into this
because the rest of this is all kind of
opinion stuff hit me what are your
thoughts I don't like it okay can i I'm
gonna can I play devil's advocate on
this one because if you're gonna be if
you're gonna not like it then I'm gonna
make the counter-argument here um your
Android phone gets slow within a matter
of weeks anyway even if the battery is
perfect I haven't really used an iPhone
very much but don't they do pretty much
the same thing and mine doesn't do in a
matter of weeks to be fair okay so the
pixel lasts a little longer it lasts
quite a while quite a while longer and
then I just reformatted it and then it
was totally fine
I'm on the pixel to excel right now I'm
quite happy with you with the mine took
like over half a year okay look I'm not
supposed to be on your side
so and then I reformatted it and then it
was fine again let's all let's bear in
mind though that like Samsung owns the
lion's share of Android right now okay
and I'm not defending Samsung yeah so
okay so so you know hey at least your
performance is good for a year
oh yeah then I reform but then you can
just you can't do that on an iPhone it
doesn't solve the problem no it doesn't
solve the problem here like it so I have
the ability to solve the problem
iPhone doesn't you not went in here I
don't like this because this way like
say say I'm not a techy person okay try
say say I'm not a trek Sam not I've read
wrecked in the in say I'm not a techy
person yeah let's say that
and you're my buddy and you're like wow
wavy way to be it with that little i
gestured thing and and i have a phone
and i'm complaining to you that it got
slower yeah if it's an android phone you
can be like hey back up all your stuff
reformat it put it back on everything's
fine it's an iPhone you can be like go
buy a new iPhone but I guess yeah so
really the upsetting thing here is not
Apple degrading the performance to me
that actually doesn't bother me and it
wouldn't surprise me if other people
were doing it and it wouldn't oh yeah
big deal to me oh I would not be even
remotely surprised at all if it was on
the other side of the field as well so
the part that is bothering me is that
Apple is shipping these devices with
batteries that are not only not user
upgradeable because I have that ship has
sailed I've gotten over that but that
are difficult to DIY repair upgrade yeah
so I should have said user upgradeable
user replaceable but they're difficult
even as someone with a reasonable amount
of DIY knowledge like I have replaced
phone batteries before even on ones with
non-replaceable back yeah it's like it's
it's not rocket science if you're
careful and you go slow yeah but
they're making these devices that are
difficult to replace the battery for and
they are running them so close to the
red line that surely they must know when
they're shipping these things because
it's not like lithium-ion or lithium
polymer batteries are especially new
technology at this point Apple in
particular has done tons of research in
this field they know exactly what's
gonna happen with this thing yeah pretty
much perfectly and they're making a
conscious decision like the fact that
the iPhone 7 is affected they're making
a conscious decision to run them so
close to the red line sorry this side
red line that they can only handle it
for a year can you imagine if a car
manufacturer did this like let's say for
example that Volkswagen nothing against
Volkswagen let's say for example they're
like not that long ago giant issues but
yeah let's say for example Volkswagen
shipped a car that had great emissions
for the first year okay yeah and then
when all the press have stopped
benchmarking it and all those users well
they're just plumb out of warranty let's
say hypothetically that when nobody was
looking they made it so the emissions
were bad would that not be kind of
similar and now to be clear we're not
talking about a 10 year old car that
just don't run the way it used to that's
okay
this is very targeted you know that's
why you know that's why well DC used to
anyway BC had a program called air care
where people would have to take very old
vehicles yeah and they would have to
demonstrate that they've been keeping
them up well enough it was you don't
have really difficult formal emissions
it was like a huge problem to get my
nightmare and you know I had a car
before that I used to have to make sure
I had of nice fresh oil change in it a
nice special world changing
way for a while premium gas yeah yeah we
know anyway the point is the point is
this is I really don't think okay so my
iPhone for my iPhone 4 is really slow
and I get it that's a really old device
that also you know is not getting
security updates anymore like really has
no no right to be to be used like as a
daily driver at this point and and I
could and the thing too is like I could
replace it with something that would be
a much better experience for an amount
of money that I consider reasonable to
tell someone just upgrade your device
like I could upgrade to an iPhone 5s and
that would be way better I could get a
cheap 5s I'd get a way better experience
and I could probably do that for a lot
of notify this is worth it can't be more
than like around 100 bucks like I can't
even I don't know the point is Apple is
not doing that with six year old devices
Apple is doing this with devices that
are well within what I would consider to
be the the prime of their lives a one
year old phone is not an old phone
you're looking at used 150 give or take
10 20 and new 200 240 okay and but I
consider I consider a used phone if
you're on a budget a perfectly
reasonable thing to do yeah so so I'm
not that far off um so I can't I can't
defend what they're doing because it
really feels misleading I'd like because
I'm gonna be chasing that headline
they're chasing that headline how the
iPhones the fastest have they posted
anything in response to this I'm
actually you know what to be perfectly
honest I'm not sure because to flip
sides on you a little bit I wonder if
there is some legitimate technical
reason to the point of trying to reduce
issues with these batteries mmm-hmm
maybe using them at the same rate as
before it could could produce critical
situations where you have because
batteries sorry
shutdown's yeah we talked about that
already
preventing shutdowns battery issues
having looking in my on battery in your
pocket is like not cool and has become
really common but it's like super
sketchy and luckily these manufacturers
of things have been doing things mostly
right outside of Samsung that one time
you know yeah bombs you know funny to
joke about now so I don't know it could
have something to do with that I haven't
personally seen an official statement
anywhere yeah they've acknowledged that
they're doing if they've set it to
prevent shutdowns but basically the cold
hard truth is they're only doing this so
that they can they can run it right at
the redline for a while knowing that no
one's gonna no one's gonna benchmark it
and no one's gonna give this the kind of
press like even now we're talking about
it now but when the iPhone x2 or
whatever maybe it'll take on like a
final fantasy ask yeah maybe when the
the iPhone x2 rolls around by the time
that happens we're not gonna be talking
about this again we're not gonna be like
here's the review of the new iPhone x2
by the way your iPhone 10 now performs
like this and your iPhone 8 now performs
like this we sure but we but you can't
because it won't even necessarily be
applicable
maybe maybe mine is still running at 98%
but maybe there are other people out
there who let's say they use wireless
charging all the time which by the way
like Apple won't say yes it degrades it
and I can't say like like with absolute
certainty yes it will degrade it this
amount but it will degrade it some
amount we don't know how much but heat
is bad
we know this heat is bad for batteries
and wireless charging produces more heat
so someone who's running around like
leaving their phone on a wireless
charger trickle charging all the time
for example or who just uses a wireless
charger at night unnecessarily instead
of plugging in they could be at risk of
actually degrading the performance of
their phone a year two down the line so
this is something like we're gonna want
to keep talking about
don't know if it's uh I really don't
know if it's gonna keep people's
attention the way that a shiny fast new
iPhone does okay let's get let's get
through our sponsors and then we'll talk
about Luke leaving - Media Group sure
see how I made them stay tuned like that
so first up is Squarespace think about
it this might be your last
Squarespace sponsor spot as an lmg
employee okay yeah that crazy maybe I
know I'd also put a little bit of a
spoiler in there I think we're gonna
continue working with Squarespace for a
long time yet Squarespace is the place
to go to you know let's say you weren't
employed with the old employers and or
let's say you had to create an online
portfolio - Wow - you know Wow Jesus if
I needed to do that I'd have 24/7 live
chat and email support which would be
great it would only cost me $12 a month
because apparently I don't have a job
anymore except I do
oh-ho they're great templates feature
responsive design so they'll look great
if your potential employer is looking at
them on a laptop computer or on their
slow year-old phone they've got a lot of
great features like their logo designer
and cover pages the ability to publish
content and Apple news format directly
from the Squarespace blog every site
includes commerce like if you wanted to
I don't know spend all that spare time
that you might have leaving little Etsy
baskets you can sell them for your
Squarespace good evening yes if you if
you sign up for a year you get a free
domain yep so head over to
squarespace.com slash win and use offer
code win to get 10% off which leads us
right into our next sponsor spot I fix
it so let's say that the basket-weaving
doesn't doesn't work out for you then
yeah maybe you want to get into
small-time electronics repair like
replacing batteries and phones iFixit
has got the tools for you they've got
everything from suction cups to their 64
bit driver kit - they're like big tool
pack with Blake the magnetic
that has all the little it's like
dry-erase so you can write what
everything is and you can stick all the
screws to it super handy ESD straps
they've got everything and they've got
the guides so you won't actually know
have to know a damn thing about
electronic repair yeah to start up a
Squarespace site get your eye fix-it kit
and start repairing electronics go to
ifixit.com slash Linus and get the fully
loaded Pro Tech tool kit for just 60 US
dollars and then once that starts going
well when you need to do all your
accounting for your small business
you use your eye fix-it tools on that
you advertise on your Squarespace site
you can use fresh books as bad as up
that is a grand slash this was set up
and you can create and send
slick-looking invoices oh boy in just
seconds fresh books is everything you
need as a small business owner or
freelancer to help you keep track of
your time with their timesheet function
manage your expenses and keep track of
who owes you what as for me LMG only
giving you anything that's gonna be
nothing so you know technically well
okay well yeah I think it's gonna be the
other way around because you get fresh
books has tons of great features they've
got mobile support so you've got the
full functionality of the fresh books
cloud accounting platform on Android or
iOS however slow that might be and if
you've got any questions you can reach
out to their support staff where you'll
speak to a real human no phone tree no
escalations no return calls just answers
so go to fresh books talk comm slash win
and get a free trial try out fresh books
I yeah you know what fresh books is one
of those ones where I've like poked the
bear
I've tempted fate I've said it's one of
the sponsors one of the few sponsors
that we have never gotten a competitor
hasn't we stop and we still haven't
gotten one not nothing credible I
shouldn't say we've never gotten one
because me right we might have gotten
something but yeah I've never because I
will actually escalate things
personally a brand if something comes
through and they're an actual customer
but nothing has ever made it to my desk
I have never seen a comment it's
impressive
so go get a 30-day free trial at the
link in the video description fresh
books comm slash tech tips enter the
wine show in the how to do both all
right
so you're leaving lands Media Group or
are you being bad
I don't I literally don't know how is
that going to work does that have to
leave that has to legally work in a way
oh yeah oh yeah like you're gone you're
done no I know but that's one like it
has to be one right oh no no it's it's
that yeah yeah and you're not laid off
so I think technically you have to quit
have to you have to quit what if I don't
quit this sucks
what happens yeah no I'm pretty sure you
have to because your other employer
floatplane media yo by the way it may
actually be a conflict of interest for
you to maintain your position so so Luke
is not quitting quitting
he's just quitting yeah confusing so I'm
still gonna be on wine show if Linus
ever actually lets me make a video I
will make a video I'm gonna be at sea
together that's not really oh that's
gonna be fun it'll be fun yeah and you
have I'm not sure if I should make a
video on that I think you should I don't
it's not as cool no no if nothing else
we could do the classic react and just
have some fun with it yeah yeah I do
want to still do some stuff you might
okay so anyways floatplane has been my
full-time thing for quite a while now so
most of this stuff is just stuff
happening on paper that doesn't actually
mean anything for you guys I'm still
gonna be on the way and show every week
you'll be doing CES coverage gonna be
doing CES coverage so I'll be making
videos down there for sure I won't be
making as many as you know I get to
handle like those to load myself this
year which is great yeah don't think for
that there's some perception aliy
confusion stuff with the scheduling side
of things I think I can do more than I'm
currently scheduled for oh okay so we'll
see how that goes player yeah I yeah
basically nothing's gonna change on your
side of things I'll still be doing CES
I'll still be doing Wine Show I'm just
gonna be doing a video every now and
then just kind of you know not that
often and I will be more on paper same
with everyone that is currently a
floatplane person will be more on paper
a floatplane person because right now
we're all technically like- media group
yeah so right now linus media group is
paying the bills but starting january
first formally floatplane media is
starting up as a separate company
floatplane media is acquiring the
employees and the intellectual property
from linus media group that will the
trademarks all that kind of stuff and it
will become its own separate legal
entities we were joking about it earlier
on the show but we are actually going to
like put tape down on the floor maybe
put up a sign or something like make it
kind of fun and floatplane media will
have an office it'll be here within this
building yeah
but legally speaking well it'll be it's
it's like you have to listen yeah it's
like you're renting space minus media
group will be subleasing yeah some of
the property to floatplane media and
flips leemy you like has to pay for it
like yeah like legally either you can't
give stuff away at least here in BC like
you can't give away a car to a friend
unless it's like under a certain value
because there's there's taxation
problems with that so like - Media Group
can't just be like we're buddies you can
use our office space so we have to
actually start doing everything by the
book which is both
terrifying and really exciting because
you know I have something really cool to
show you guys that we weren't a hundred
percent sure if we were gonna show you
guys don't think it's a great idea but
you know what I want to do it this is so
cool - the screen I'm even I'm even
gonna put I'm even just gonna get rid of
us we're just gonna we're just gonna go
flow this low plain front and center oh
yeah that's all fine that's just places
I go here we go
so this is the sign-in screen now to be
clear this won't work for you guys yet
my account was manually created by
manually creating entries in the
database and we're not gonna talk about
that okay what just happened
well okay crying out loud okay so this
is a sneak peek at the pre-alpha
pre-alpha a floatplane dot-com so you
can see here there's a few things like
like what what can i what can i show
should i click on a video sure okay
that one so raise your phone the review
of the razor phone is one of the videos
that is up on Flo plain but is not yet
up on YouTube so you can see here the
video content is really front and center
in the design some of these things are
gonna end up tweaked just to be clear
like this is we're calling it pre-alpha
because everyone hears bata and thinks
basically finished product yeah because
that's changed in my lifetime but this
is yeah let's call it pre-alpha even
though it's it's if you like go with how
that structure worked when I was young
this is like a beta if you go with how
that structure works now with things
like the early access games on stream
then this is a like pre alpha however
however you want to see it it's early on
yeah so man that player that's good man
so there's a lot of stuff that you might
not have expected from a pre-alpha stage
type product so we've got thumbnail
previews working one of our guys Yuki
has worked really hard and gotten it so
that our color profiles are wider than
places like YouTube so if you have
something like a really dark shot
you'll be able to see more on our
platform we can't show you the proper
comparison for that right now it's not a
Content don't think it would come
through twitch anyways yeah so we can't
really show you also there's a guy that
I don't know if I can say his name yet I
haven't asked him has been working on
live streaming really heavily you can
see live testing I don't think I'm
currently running right now so yeah but
should we talk about that yeah I think
we should totally talk soon
well then I want to go I want to go a
little bit oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
let's talk about that okay hold on let's
let's pull back to us for a second then
yeah so Kyle from bit wet he's gonna be
the plan is the last time I heard from
him is nope oh he's like now is now a
good time for you to show me the ropes
no I'm streaming right now so Kyle is
actually planning to do the first
public-facing floatplane livestream like
the first official one not a test yeah
tonight so if you are subscribed to bit
with ultra on flow plane then right now
that's still running through the Linus
tech tips comm forum yeah I'm just gonna
pay for that I don't know if I can say
his name publicly has been working
really hard on the new payment system
which is awesome because the current
payment system is horeb terrible and
we're gonna do it right and we're gonna
have an awesome payment system coming
yeah the best payment system the best
the greatest payment system so that's
really exciting so you guys might want
to check out bit wait that'll be the
first floatplane livestream from a
creator let's just go back to let's go
back to this here is the screen so
that's still running which is good I
can't show you guys right now
but we have a chat system working for
the live stream and that chat system has
like basic moderation tools and
highlighting for when the creator talks
in the chat and all this other kind of
really cool stuff that I don't know if I
can say name has been acting really hard
on and and it actually looks pretty good
this is pretty cool
we've got comments working we are gonna
have thumbs down because we believe that
some comments deserve a thumbs down damn
it
yeah they do down voting is important
these are real people by the way these
are people actually using the site these
are our pre alpha testers yeah
so this is one you can see it's shaded
green because I thumbs it up few people
thumbs that up we don't have replies
working but that's coming that's coming
yep it's being worked on everyone on the
full point team has been like going
super hard I even told like everybody
that they could leave early today and
people are still talking in the work
chat because they're watching the stream
right now I can see you on the phone
which is like that's that's pretty
hardcore I don't know so this is pretty
cool there's a live button here so
Kyle's channel when he's live hopefully
we would be able to yeah we're gonna
have so we're gonna have this standard
like there will be a thumbnail sitting
here yeah situation there'll be some
stuff you can fill in here this is just
placeholder text right now I'm
subscribed to Kyle as you can see and
then this is that this is a chat so yeah
so that you can talk so so that's what
the live-streaming will look like let's
go ahead and go back to our stuff we can
talk about some of the stuff that's on
there so we've got the lg gran late 2017
that videos up we've got best case under
35 bucks this is what Luke was referring
to earlier when he was saying the
editors when they upload the videos are
not using like the real title like this
is just our filename yeah they don't
they don't realize that it's public
facing now cuz that's a feature that
we've had for a long time the ability to
put a title and description and keywords
and stuff but it's never actually been
public facing because we've just been
posting them into the forum so that's
great Dale the sleeper is live now so
that's the sequel to Hubert the sleeper
this is a really cool machine you guys
razor phone is up oh the quad-core blade
stealth that video is up lenovo thinkpad
anniversary edition that's up on
floatplane and we do have some exclusive
content over there as well so this is a
pretty cool little look at the but guts
did you see this yes
like kind of the equivalent of a
developing kit a developer kit for
automated cars it's really cool stuff I
don't recognize almost anything but the
number of sensors in this thing is
freaking bananas so it's just a little
three minute three minute tour of that I
actually think I have another update
that's gonna go up probably sometime
this weekend so should I show them the
SEMA so another another cool thing
that's working there's no way to set it
manually right now but automatic quality
changing yeah yeah you definitely show
that automatic quality changing is gonna
work on the stream which is really cool
AJ's been working on that and a huge
amount of other things for quite a while
so that's I'm stoked that that's working
so oh someone says they don't see Dale
on floatplane oh crap I wonder if it's
like someone set it to the wrong status
very recently we finished update okay
well what you'll know for sure then
having seen that very soon because the
videos ready we very recently finished
an update that allows for like the
public private unlisted style setup that
most video platform sites have and
haven't started using it yet so
everything's just been public on that
site so there you got people asking
about iJustine I definitely have talked
suggesting about it I'm okay here's the
thing I haven't talked to that many
people about it just because I haven't
had anything to show them up until about
this week other than like still images
and because you don't wanna it's it's a
weird balance of like we don't want to
do the always in beta thing
yeah then we've been in production since
before we had anything yeah so we have
kind of always been in beta and we
didn't want to like advertise to other
Creators before then and it's a chicken
and egg thing too because it's hard to
you don't want to spend a year working
on a platform if you don't have any
creators but you don't want to talk to
creators about a platform that doesn't
exist that you don't have you don't want
to make promises that you can't back
so we've been really cautious and really
careful about what we can commit to and
you know we're we're doing our best to
to keep from to keep from disappointing
anybody I think that's that's really the
main thing for us is we're trying not to
not to screw anything up we'll
floatplane allow Ken girls I'm sure you
mean kam girls and no comment at this
time
one thing I will say about floatplane is
that we do intend for it to be fairly
non restrictive
in terms of the kind of content creators
that can be there well there's there's
also yeah there's no should we go into
that and go into it slightly I don't
think we should go into a ton of detail
I mean this is when show we can still do
a little bit of tech news we've done
like two topics but it's something that
it's extremely unlikely that a
conventional cam girl will be on the
platform but if there's like an artistic
element we're going to look into that
side of things maybe yeah so we'll see
we're not sure yet we're gonna work with
like creators and like friends of ours
like that's who we're gonna work with in
terms of like what they want this
platform to be because right now we're
just building a tool box and we want
people to use it the way that the way
that they want to use it my phone's
dying by all the floatplane people that
I don't know if I can say your name
great work people are like body paint
very happy to show it that's gonna be a
gray area see you like I don't we don't
know we're gonna it's it's gonna take
talking to people it's gonna take
planning we're not really focused on
that right now yep Intel CPU until CPU
yeah Intel CEO and kind of the CPU we
are going to take more risks the
original article here is from tech
spot.com
let's go ahead and actually click that
and see if that's gonna work for me
there yeah how's that going - his screen
we're going to take more risks we are
taking the bull by the horns that is
some pretty corporate speak right there
here's a letter that Brian krzanich
wrote to the employees of the 2017 comes
to a close almost impossible to predict
the future one cool thing is that Intel
is almost a 50-50 company which is to
say that half the revenue comes from the
PC
half from new things that they have
tried to create and it's it's weird to
think of Intel as an underdog but in a
lot of those markets they are you know
you look at Intel the way they tried to
break into phones for example yes aster
yeah but that doesn't mean that they're
gonna stop doing that they're just gonna
keep trying new things and see if they
can go that way apparently so that's
good
I guess do you want to talk about the
magic leap we still don't really know
much yeah I guess we can go quickly I
can talk about it though
one they have an amazing website you
should go to their actual native website
it's really cool yeah it's like you
scroll down like it's the birth of like
its crystal ball it's actually worth
looking at just because it's like just
really cool yeah that scroll didn't work
as well see there you go yeah
see that so I'm scrolling with my
touchpad right now and it like goes out
of this like that and then you start
actually scrolling down the page and it
looks like a normal website so there's a
few things that we can see here one is
that this is photoshopped is it that's
hilarious
that's a render yeah yeah there's
absolutely no way look at this I don't
buy it
that's hilarious yeah like let's see it
see the light coming off his face on
this side and see the way that this yeah
like you can tell they tried but no I
don't buy it huh either way I believe
those are translucent lenses they show
it somewhere else that's pretty cool and
the fact that you can yeah so you can
see through it
which is super cool did a light field
scroll up a little bit I noticed one
thing you know haven't been talking
about this this since the garage
compute that is untethered from the wall
yeah but is not up on your head that's
really cool that's a way better approach
I remember we had joked about doing like
a wearable computer where we literally
like strapped to ups to the back and
like the power supply so you could have
like a full desktop experience but
wearing the whole thing as a bodysuit
as opposed to putting the whole thing in
a backpack yeah but like that's actually
a very cool idea having having
untethered but also tethered but where
it's tethered to you is very cool SDKs
coming in Geoff's thing I signed up as a
reporter there's different ways that you
can sign up sign up as a developer
whatever else I sign up as a reporter
I'm waiting to hear back this is super
interesting open up displays all over
the room
yeah gaming in a are basically yeah the
fact the fact that you can see through
the lenses is very cool because the
there isn't that many of those that are
actually you can you can that you can
get that are any good and aren't
basically just fakes so they're saying
they're gonna ship in 2018 yeah and you
get that controller which doesn't look
like the most gamer II controller it
looks like an experiential controller
yeah that doesn't mean it won't be
compatible with other controllers yeah
USB type-c looks this looks like a
wireless that's the computer no no this
looks like oh oh is it the whole thing
is the computer I'm not sure I think
that might be Wireless charge module on
the bottom because if not that's a lot
to tuck into a belt or whatever yeah but
that is the compute unit we can run up
and have a look at the guy who had it on
yeah I think that's just it looks like
it's in his pocket though it doesn't
look like it's major whose belt so it
could be really bulky on the inside okay
I haven't read the individual things
that I think it I think the bulk does go
here actually here so you can kind of
see that it looks like that big bulky
thing does go into his pocket I like
that that looks quite robust yeah I mean
he's gonna be moving around quite a bit
but the thing is is that if you make it
too robust then it just wears yeah I
know yeah
we've run into that before that's for
sure yeah it looks fairly well done so
yeah these guys have gotten a lot of
funding including from Intel speaking of
experimental things that Intel's done
lets it better than a backpack I guess I
would I would think so it looks like
it's gonna be about the same performance
scale as the ones that intend to have it
built into the headset but adding weight
to the headset is not in my opinion the
right way to do it and having it so that
it can go on in like your pocket or
something that sounds cool
well that's what I've been talking about
the compute and storage disk that goes
in your pocket for the last like four
years so I'm stoked that it's happening
in a way I may be wrong about Intel
having backed magically Google for sure
Alibaba for sure but I I might be I
might have been wrong about that one I
thought they were one of the ones that
had put some money into it apparently
they've raised about two billion dollars
so far Jews and they have shown what
basically nothing probably yeah Nvidia
and a driver support for 32-bit
operating systems so the original
article there this is posted by matric
oh seven oh one two on the forum the
original article is from Nvidia there we
go
yeah so I get it like yeah Windows 10
32-bit like you really suck at buying
Windows they literally didn't even know
that was a thing yeah it's pretty dumb
why do they even do that
I don't know compatibility with Wakko
stuff I guess I would just run the
previous OS Juran senkei yeah but then
you would engage security updates like
Microsoft Store has lost version of
Windows AMD confirmed second generation
Rison processors to debut in q1 2018
cool so they'll be like a little bit
more better yeah to be clear second
generation does not mean Zen to so we
can expect tweaks
not-not-not twerks still cool yeah still
cool
that's exciting it's cool to see them
actually continuing to release stuff
um GRU make a posted this on the forum
Seagate has announced multi actuator
technology yeah
Wang so now I thought this was a graphic
here we go yeah there it goes so now you
can actually boost performance by having
the read and write heads move to
different parts of the disk
independently so if you need something
that's on this platter this head can go
get it
and if you need something else on this
platter this head can go get it and they
don't have to wait for each other so
this is kind of like SLI for hard drives
but like inside the drive yeah in the
past and alike is actually becoming a
thing instead of becoming less of things
yeah so in the past all of those heads
would have had to move in
synchronization whereas now they can
split up now to be clear you won't
expect to double the performance know
much like SLI but what you will get is
potentially much improved random reads
and writes yes I mean I'm not gonna say
that it's you know gonna get up there
with an SSD but it's gonna be a lot
better I would think and like if you're
in like a torturous situation where hard
drives would like really really really
start bottlenecking
and this one should feel it much less
yeah okay there's actually a lot more
stuff in here but like the show is most
assuredly over because it is a
definitely Christmas break and people
definitely want to go home and I'm
definitely not done shooting mining
adventure part 2 over there so that's
pretty much it oh wait no are we good
yeah yeah I think so
if you are a bit wit ultra subscriber
yeah either myself or Kyle or Linus will
post a thing on how to view his live
stream yeah right in the bit with ultra
subform yeah on the actual forum forum
like not on the floatplane site the
floatplane site is still closed
pre-alpha oh yeah I'm gonna have like at
least a few hours of support tickets
again this weekend explaining that that
is not the site people are supposed to
go to happens every time
guys please do not write Lucas support
ticket because then the site development
will be slower
it probably won't affected that much
that's I'm trying to scare them yeah
it'll be so alright so you get next week
same bat-time same bat-channel why isn't
this playing I don't know what's going
on here over there before right click
yeah properties yeah
on the christmas team I'm on the why not
both team Merry Christmas Happy Holidays
jovial time off whatever doesn't make
you unhappy
yeah like merry PTO that's what
Americans call it oh oh paid time off
yeah oh hold on and hold on we're still
