all-in-one if you have to plug in an
army of peripherals with wire snaking
all over the place well the Dell XPS 27
promises to knock at least some of the
clutter off your table with its
apparently audiophile grade 10 speaker
sound system well I like the sound of
that but can it deliver on the hype
let's find out
the master keys pro keyboard lineup from
Coolermaster is available in three sizes
each in white or RGB flavours check them
out at the link below only a single
cable is required to run the XPS 27
everything but the mouse and keyboard
including the power supply is contained
inside its sharp professional form
factor and this thing is pretty darn
sexy especially from the front and it
feels pretty good too thanks to its
hefty aluminum construction the touch
version is a whopping 37 and a half
pounds but if that's a little heavy for
your tastes the non touch version is
eight pounds lighter though it lacks
this really cool articulating arm that
allows the display to go from five
degrees down all the way to completely
flat something even the Microsoft
Surface Studio does not do we do need to
be careful about comparing this to the
surface studio though because Dell
positions the canvas monitor as their
studio killer but since we're at it it
should be noted that the XPS 27 screen
takes considerably more force to adjust
than the studio on the right you'll find
the power button along with a USB 3 port
with power share and on the left we have
a welcome SD card slot and a headphone
jack above the 27-inch screen is a four
microphone array that allows you to
summon Cortana
from up to 15 feet away then below it a
720p infrared camera and two infrared
emitters for Windows hello and the XPS
27 s claim to fame the 10 speaker sound
system which I will explain more about
after I show you the rest of the IO
which hold on I'll get it ok yeah
unfortunately getting at the little cave
that contains the rest of the plugs
requires the reach-around technique and
some clumsy fumbling but once you get in
there you'll find that your shiny new
AIO is fairly well endowed
it's got Gigabit Ethernet DisplayPort
out and HDMI out
- Thunderbolt 3 USB type-c ports audio
line out and for USB 3 ports plus a
bonus USB hidden below this removable
panel the perfect spot for the dongle
for the surprisingly excellent included
wireless keyboard that even features
high-end multi device functionality and
the strikingly mediocre Mouse this is
also the place where you'll find the
only two screws holding the back cover
on and then the three more that reveal
the motherboard making this machine
shockingly easy to upgrade not that we
would want to the base model priced at
1349 has a core i5 6400 processor with
onboard graphics but most models are
equipped with a core i7 6700 with either
AMD r9 m4 70 X or m4 85 X graphics our
16 gig SKU has two slots available
allowing for an easy upgrade path to 32
gigs and a total of three storage bays
one m2 nvme with its own freaking fan
which is great for preventing thermal
throttling and two two and a half inch
for additional SSDs or hard drives so
that's pretty cool and so are the
thermals we taxed the FPU at the same
time as running the fuzzy donut of death
and although it did reach the point
where it sounded like it was ready for
liftoff the CPU leveled off at 85
degrees Celsius and never throttled I
feel pretty good about Dells thermal
solution here bottom line then the XPS
27 s performance is suitable for 4k
media consumption assuming no DRM
restrictions that require a seventh gen
processor and even photo and video
editing and creation which the 3840 by
2160 4k IPS display will handle nicely
it suffers from best buy TV syndrome a
little bit out of the box with
overcooked Reds and some sort of a green
cast on the whites and grays but with
calibration this display could easily be
used by professional photo editors
it's available in both touchscreen and
non touchscreen flavors and boasts wide
viewing angles a brightness of 300 plus
nits and over a billion colors and the
boasting is justified this is a very
good display it covers 99.95% of the
Adobe RGB color space with spot-on color
temperature and gamma out of the box and
one of the best contrast ratios we've
ever tested which makes it especially
tragic that Dell neglected to include an
HDMI input so if you were hoping to get
some more mileage out of your XPS 27 as
a monitor once the computer hardware is
obsolete you will be sorely disappointed
which I guess leads us perfectly into
our next topic if you're gonna put a
dedicated graphics card in it we're
going to run some games our unit with
the AMD m4 70 X and 4 gigs of gddr5 had
Deus Ex mankind divided running it 32
FPS on low with rise of the Tomb Raider
averaging 48 FPS on low and 38 on medium
but it should be noted that that's at
1080p 1/4 of the screens resolution both
games were absolute slideshows when we
tried them at 4k but in Dells defense
they never told us that this thing was
built for gaming Dell is emphasizing
that every single person who buys one of
these is getting the utmost in both
display and audio quality a first in the
a i/o category that's dominated by the
imac a computer with its FaceTime
microphone on the back so how does it
sound actually pretty friggin decent
it's got good articulation with clear
highs and the width of the sound bar
gives it a noticeable stereo effect it's
not perfect I'm not sure if the
marketing accounts for the drop off and
sound quality when it nears full volume
and the bass is present but obviously
not nearly as low as could be achieved
with a separate subwoofer but that
doesn't mean we weren't really really
impressed the speakers are great for
rocking out while you work
watching movies or even providing
background music when you have a few
people over you know if you think about
it going out to eat not only is really
expensive it's actually not that
efficient you spend all this time
driving when you could have just been
preparing a meal and cleaning up after
it so blue apron solves that problem
they allow you to create delicious chef
inspired recipes at home by delivering
all the farm-fresh ingredients you need
right to your doorstep in exactly the
right proportions so no extra trips to
the grocery store and no waste from
unused ingredients they offer two types
of plans the two-person plan and the
family plan and there is no commitment
whatsoever you can skip or cancel at any
time all the meals can be prepared in 40
minutes or less and you don't even have

home and they deliver my food to my
doorstep because they ship in these
refrigerated containers that keep
everything fresh they've got a wide
variety of recipes and they're always
adding new dishes to the menu every week
