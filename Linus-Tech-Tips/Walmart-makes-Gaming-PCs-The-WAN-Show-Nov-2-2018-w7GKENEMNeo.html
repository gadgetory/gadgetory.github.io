for a wine show today are you yeah why
because as soon as I'm done Rancho oh
wait no nevermind I thought as soon as I
was done land show we were gonna be
going out for fun but actually as soon
as I'm done when show I need to shoot
the other half of the video so oh wow
that OH
gonna be a great week everyone we have
really awesome news first topic I
started out up here if you want a topic
that starts on a confusing note instead
of a high or low yeah I've got Walmart
is making gaming pcs yeah I'm not just
like they're selling gaming pcs from
iBUYPOWER Lake no these are Walmart
gaming towers well like they don't look
that horrible Apple quietly added Radeon
Vega GPU options to the MacBook Pro that
is pretty sick I have no idea how that's
going to affect the thermals trusted
reviews pays 1 million pounds
yeah after Red Dead Redemption 2 leaks
so this is really confusing to me and
I'm going to so yeah well we'll have to
do that go over that later know what
that's gonna be what we're calling an
interactive topic segment yeah yeah I'm
creating branding for it I like you
that's where Luke and I have no idea
what the crap is going on yeah so we're
gonna be really relying on you the
viewer to kind of walk us through so I'm
gonna start with what I think is going
we're changing the name win show hmm
we probably should change the name of
the land show because it's like not
really analysis and news it's more like
weekly judgment to news weekly shooting
the breeze and there's not a lot of news
anymore so do some technically yeah
there's some but it's like usually just
like about our lives ah finally Apple
launches a vintage repair program for
Macs and iPhones okay I've got one more
news topic Before we jump into the intro
here and that is that the Galaxy watch
has quite possibly the worst activity
tracker that I have ever encountered
almost every single time I walk down the
stairs I get a little buzz on my wrist
well done great workout
no no I was going down the stairs and it
was still was telling me what a good job
I was doing right now I'm sitting here
like this yes I'm waving my arms around
him maybe that's how I don't get that
you're just so animated talking with my
hands talking with your hands it's gonna
be the new workout sensation and on that
note bye
leave at night
don't touch it I like my car the flame
regarding
I don't know
I don't have the thing up right now so I
can't even tell what you're changing
yeah it does look a little bit all right
take the word all right now it's off the
white line thing what are you even
and like that the white line thing isn't
centered either and that's bad you know
what just should be yeah he didn't move
the camera he didn't move the camera
it's fine who cares let's just it's
right
I mean it's when show what are people's
expectations of this at this point like
peaking about questionable expectations
Walmart gaming people all Mart gaming
pcs okay so with the plum here we go
Walmart has partnered with eSports Arena
to create its go ahead please Opie line
of pre-built gaming desktops also very
definitely overpowered that's what
that's what that means it means
overpowered really like okay I'm not
even trying to who was the marketing
executive that was like I don't think
it's a bed really that's the it's the
decent you know the Opie DTW one okay
that's bad that is terrible I didn't
know that part or the Opie DTW too
that's another model if it was like just
op1 and Opie - that could be okay yeah
but it sounds more like a model name
unless like a brand the overpowered or
Opie line of and they had desktops and
laptops here but is this gonna be like
like the like g-force before the other
thing you know what I mean I don't think
it's that bad I mean I guess there's
they're certainly worse there's that
like I guess in light I had gained in
light of some of the not even just that
in light of some of the general naming
that's happened recently I'm coming
around I'm coming around what's that new
isn't it a Samsung phone I'm coming
around to it ah yeah wear it like goes
backwards yeah a stupid thing something
weird like that I don't all right all
right all right all right all right okay
all right I've come I've come around to
it I mean honestly it's a lot less
cringy than Republic of gamers which we
only accept because it's been around for
so long and everyone ever tries as hard
as they can to make sure they can throw
the abbreviation in instead of the full
name
ROG is like pretty cool ROG sounds fine
yeah Republic of gamers which was what
they were it's it is remarkable to me
what asus has done with the Republic of
gamers brand because the first product
that launched under it was awful I'm
serious our army wasn't it was the
Stryker extreme it was an N Force 680
chipset motherboard oh if I recall
correctly was it 680 you know don't
quote me on that I thought I think it's
680 but don't don't quote me on that
anyway it was the Stryker extreme no
remember of the chips that was and our
arm a raid on that at NCIX was like 40%
yeah and it was like a 450 or $500
motherboard or something stupid like
that I can I can bring it yeah I should
I should bring up the picture so Stryker
extreme there we go screen share with
you guys here look at this look at this
tweak town tweak town review not one
star one star this board was that bad
well yeah it was and for 680 is Li yeah
and it just I don't know what memory it
did work with because you could put
random memory in it you could put
generic memory in it you could put
high-end memory in it you could put sli
certified memory that was good and the
idea was that it was certified for
NVIDIA chips you could put anything in
this board and then you could roll a die
pray to whatever gods it is that you
believe in and turn around six times in
a circle and you know go like this and
none of it would affect anything it
might work it might not it was an awful
awful motherboard but they've they've
they've really turned they've really
turned that around they really took that
around good for them good for them good
for gamers anyway back to the Opie line
of gaming desktops from Walmart the d2w
one is the entry-level model with a core
i7 8700 16 gigs of memory and NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 970 256 gigs of solid-state
storage and a 2 terabyte hard drive for
$13.99 that's actually not that bad
yeah honestly that was my first thought
when I looked at this was like oh that's
oh
should we review it yeah I was kind of
asking them but sure yes should we
review it yeah yeah cuz I might gaming I
would be very interested as a consumer
yeah because it seems like a decent
price whatever whatever sure but my like
techy consumer brain is like what memory
is that what board is that what drive is
that oh my god stuff from what I can
tell Walmart has no experience no
whatsoever
so it seems like okay okay to me
building a gaming computer is a pretty
straightforward thing I could literally
do it blindfolded yeah but there's
people who haven't been living and
breathing it for the last decade there's
a lot that they can screw up the headers
are complicated so I'm not like cable
management and like you know little
things like you know putting the drives
in a cage that doesn't have a cooling
fan next to it yeah so that it will run
hotter and it's not gonna kill it
immediately but it's just like little
things you can do to optimize the system
and I would want to see does Walmart
have the gaming know how to do this
correctly okay you know what we're gonna
do it even if we have to drive down to
the states we're gonna do it we're gonna
buy a Walmart Opie gaming desktop yeah
yeah okay that I would be very
apparently they're making gaming laptops
as well yeah but those are probably just
rebranded clevis yeah I mean I'm
assuming I haven't actually seen the
picture I should make this a go but yeah
Club is the parent company of them
anyways or something omits
sager not Sega it came out Sega yeah so
yeah anyway not Sega cuz I'm very much
expecting like they obviously are
throwing in Nvidia cards and Intel CPUs
I'm expecting the rest of it is just
gonna be as cheap as possible yeah I'm
pretty sure that these are close those
look they look like the most generic
looking chassis of all time yeah and I
know clever does this goofy offset
touchpad things like why there why what
reason would you want would you have for
wanting it they're actually really tried
to think of one while we were sitting
there but I can't so
and then there's the there's the dt w1
w2 w3 and the main difference is just
stepping up the graphics card brilli
this has got a 1080 TI this is a 1080
and as a 1070 your gateway to elevate
it's so weird scrolling through like
gaming computers with a Walmart logo at
the top of the page transcend your
expectation what are those over power
this is the laptop boxes yeah there's a
box why would it be over
Pawel and why is there a pufferfish here
I mean the bomb I get and the helmet
yeah the helmet I get this is this like
to make sure you don't buy the like it's
the entry-level one maybe game that gone
looks like serious Sam it dies - wow
yeah it really does this is actually
kind of cheaply done yeah it really is
you can tell that that was not very well
thought out there over 125 premium
brands from Lord and Taylor now well
might not like it it's so weird
Lord and Taylor and gaming pcs on the
same page and you can always tell when
like a company's not used to carrying a
certain thing because it's under video
games yeah sure alright anyway okay yeah
easy conclusion we're gonna show you
strong a chat with what like one to get
what no whether or not they think it's
gonna be a complete failure or not yeah
for sure do you want to get that yeah
all right I'm gonna jump on to you know
what I'll do a couple super chats before
we before we move on there all right I
can never tell what order they're in
okay we've got Chris hi Chris
we've got Stefan hi Stefan we've got
arrow did you know there's a body pillow
with you on it woah what ah no that's
okay hold on a second we might be
veering off topic a little bit here go
ahead and get that just cow cud you want
a discipline
okay I guess John Poole coming is there
just a company that makes custom body
pillows I'm sure there is ah no I don't
see it
wait need portrait image of Linus for
hug pillow senpai tek-tips
straw polls coming in the chat guys okay
so all I found so far is a picture of me
with a body pillow not the same which is
not the same thing you're so obsessed
with that channel I'm surprised you
don't have a Linus hug pillow when is
this from this is from 2014 which is
good because of that so that's been
changed by now so that's good um okay
yeah no no no I don't I don't think
that's a theremin seen one I don't think
that's the thing I think someone would
have tweeted that at me by now if that
was if that was a thing that actually
existed um yeah it's more like rant show
i if this is not a rant show we very
rarely spend the entire show ranting
yeah let's rant about that um did you
hear about hashtag Wall Street Journal
kills kids on Twitter what no I actually
stayed shockingly far away from from
Twitter and like whatever is trending on
Twitter all right what else we got here
what happens when you drop a can of
water on a PC asks Chris it dies a hi
Nicole Dorf says I've been watching you
for years and took my girlfriend
pointing it out to realize it you look
like a Keebler Elf Thank You Dorf okay
moving on then Brendon offset just as
cracks laughing what's a Keebler Elf
like do you get the reference Oh
what-what can you come explained on
stream for those for the idiots in the
audience like me you don't know what it
is you'll bring you'll show me a photo
well though here I mean I can Google a
photo
alright let's find out what a Keebler
office
you can just send my screen ok ok so
they're like the guys from like the
rudolph holiday special then like is
that a Keebler oh wait no cute no I
think he was a brand Oh
snap crackle and pop there's three guys
from Rice Krispies okay oh boy I feel
like we've gone off the rails a little
bit here do you want to send me the or
actually do have the results of the
straw poll up all right let's get that
straw poll going here results wow that's
actually quite a bit of confidence in my
opinion Walmart PC complete failure we
are almost exactly evenly split on this
I can't even believe that the community
is never so evenly divided on an issue
fifty-one percent of you are saying yes
Walmart PC complete failure forty nine
percent saying no okay let's get that's
actually let's get back to that for a
minute so I want to know what you think
I don't think it will be why hardware a
long time ago if you bought a jump bunch
of cheap stuff you're probably gonna be
screwed Hardware today is actually
generally quite stable okay and I think
relies a little bit more on fewer
components if that makes sense so I
think they'll be able to get by cheaping
out on a few different things okay all
right what do you think based on that
their pricing makes sense yeah
and that the configs make sense the fact
that they went with the 87 yeah if that
was different I also read that if I was
different I would have maybe had less
confidence I probably wouldn't have put
32 gigs in the dtw - that's the one
thing that I might have changed here
because you can always upgrade RAM you
can never unbraid Ram Walmart's probably
gonna assume that you're not going to if
you're buying computer from Walmart
that's fair and 6/6 course
12 threads I think they're two gigs on
that system probably fair using it as
both a gaming rig and a budget work
state okay all right all right all right
I'm sold I'm sold so based on the fact
that they've clearly done some research
here I'm actually in the not fail camp
as well so we are gonna see who ends up
being right about interesting yeah I
don't necessarily think it's gonna be
like a home run or anything but I don't
think it's gonna be a complete failure
in other news Apple quietly adds Radeon
Vega GPU option a begger GPU option to
their MacBook Pro and we've got a link
to ARS technica here so I guess we're
gonna go ahead with that but what also
might have been nice to just have a link
to apple.com and thunderbolt recruit max
can make use of a new black magic
ee GPU Pro I actually don't know what
would make it an e GPU Pro so Apple
claims and a GPUs will provide up to
what 60% better graphical performance
yeah that makes sense but that's
probably a very strong up to because
from our experience with the MacBook Pro
unless they are making some significant
changes to the cooling system which I
sincerely doubt that they did it is
running at within a hair's breadth of
its total limit for how fast it can go
before it experiences catastrophic
thermal throttling so like if you're
running both the CPU and the GPU hard at
the same time I just have a really hard
time imagining how they aren't both
gonna end up throttling yeah but in a
best-case scenario like for example if
you were gaming and the game you were
playing only used a couple of CPU
threads I could see this being a very
significant performance upgrade
blackmagic also has their new e GPU Pro
which will have a Radeon rx Vega 56
graphics processor okay it's just like a
pre done external GPU okay yeah I wasn't
that familiar with black magics thing
because I couldn't really figure out any
reason that anyone would buy it because
you could just buy any EGP you because
Thunderbolt 3 is a standard and you
could just plug it in that is to say as
long as it has a new enough Thunderbolt
3 chipset so I don't think Alpine Ridge
works
titin Ridge should be fine don't don't
quote me on that though I can't keep
track of like the code names for the
different Thunderbolt 3 chipsets and
this alive so I don't have time to look
things up alright um huh apparently
people are linking the body the body
pillow and discord but like because I'm
assuming our bought blocks out links oh
yeah make sense I'm not signed in well
we can cross that bridge when we get to
it yeah uh alright what else do we got
here oh boy this again Apple slows down
last year's iPhones with iOS 12.1 I mean
there was a whole thing where iOS 12 was
actually giving people with older phones
significantly better performance like a
lot of people were giving Apple really
positive feedback about iOS 12 it looks
like they've taken all that positive
feedback and mm put it in a fire so with
iOS 12.1 Apple has brought its
controversial performance management
feature to the iPhone 8 8 + &amp;amp; 10 so this
functionality throttles the phone's
processor as its battery degrades over
time and it can stop the handset from
randomly shutting down which is good but
it can also cause its performance to
degrade which is less good the good
counterpoint to that last point is that
it can be turned off if desired now I
have an easy solution to this problem
how about Apple puts bigger batteries in
their phones in the first place if they
care about the user experience I
actually was okay and again I haven't
done the background research on this I
haven't done my car review yet so I'd
still have some digging to do but I was
impressed to hear when I walked on to
the lot and I told this was at a Chevy
dealership I told them I was already
planning to buy their car and I told
them my reasoning the reason that I
wanted the Chevy Volt was because the
electric range was advertised such that
even when I factored in five years of
lithium cell aging and cold weather I
would still get the desired range which
about 45 kilometers and they were like
oh it's that's not actually how it works
we only discharge the battery down to
about 30% and we only charge it up to
about 80% like when it rolls off the lot
and so you're actually only using about
half of the capacity of the battery from
day one and then over time as the cells
degrade it will expose more of it so
that and I forget what the period of
time it was it was either five or ten
years or whatever it was over the period
of time that you use the car
there should be no noticeable difference
in the user experience and so on the
Android side of things what they do is
they just stuff gigantic batteries in
the phones as big as they can you look
at something like the oneplus 60 that's
actually a really slim device and it's
got a thirty seven hundred million power
battery yeah
and they give you all of it and then it
just degrades over time I can get behind
that particular approach I like
obviously the ideal one would be you
have extra you build in spare area so
that the users experience is always
consistent but when you're gonna have
competitors that are exposing all the
battery capacity you have to be able to
go toe-to-toe with them in review so I
understand why you can't really do that
I'm also more okay with the fully
exposed battery on a phone and I'm more
okay with the Anopheles both battery on
a car you know what I mean yeah it's
like a phone if you're gonna be cycling
it out a car you're probably gonna keep
for a longer period of time yep and
resale and all that kind of stuff and
then Apple's approach is in order to
preserve battery life and make sure the
device doesn't turn off it is to
throttle the performance I'm kind of
surprised they're sticking with this
like I get that if this was the plan all
along to roll this out for the iPhone 8
the eight plus and the ten that by the
time this whole thing blew up in their
face it was probably too late to set a
different course like in order to keep
these phones from turning off because
they were so close to like the bleeding
edge where they were gonna potentially
draw too much power once they were down
to a low percentage of battery life left
they were just gonna like turn off like
if that was if
that was the plan there's nothing that
they can do to undo that and other than
just change the amount of battery life
that is exposed to the user so that they
all would appreciate more controversial
becomes zero percent to make sure that
it won't just turn off and I'd be more
mad about that personally oh well I
think most people would be yeah yeah but
I would like to see if maybe they change
this strategy moving forward whether
that be I don't know I don't even know
what they would do do they try and get
more power-efficient on the processor
and worry less about delivering more
performance because that would work well
you can turn it off right you can turn
the feature off yes you know here's the
thing
um my aunt needs a new phone did I talk
about this um when she last week don't
think so okay so my aunt needs a new
phone and I feel like it's really easy
sometimes for people like us and people
like our viewers who I'm generalizing
but probably in a way that's pretty
accurate are among the more tech-savvy
people in their social circles right so
what Apple's doing is annoying to us and
it feels wrong to us but you got to
remember that Apple is not like some
enthusiasts brand they're not one plus
they're not ROG
or whatever the case may be we can't
make assumptions about the amount of
research and self education that the
user of an Apple product has done before
they purchase it yeah
and so I had this sort of enlightening
experience where my aunt is upgrading
her phone and I'm kind of I was trying
to talk to her about Android because
right now she's got an iPhone 5c and it
is definitely time for something new
okay and she's like oh I don't know what
that is I'm just gonna go get an iPhone
I'm kind of like okay look it's the same
as an iPhone she goes it's the same as
an iPhone it's an iPhone I go no it's
not an iPhone and she goes oh how is it
the same and I go look what do you do
with your phone and she goes I answer
calls I go okay Android is the same and
I pick up an Android phone I think it
was a note five or something
because I'm trying I'm trying to save
her a buck cuz she's gonna walk into
like a Bell store or Roger starting
she's on Roger she's gonna walk into a
Roger store they're gonna sell her an
iPhone 10s Max or whatever and it's it's
stupid because literally that is all she
does I know that for a fact she actually
also sends text messages but that really
is it like I try and I try to use pretty
great I tried to explain Google Maps and
like okay mom I love my aunt but holy
cow sometimes like she kept bringing the
CD player over to her house and look I
have google play music I put a phone on
the counter like it is dedicated to just
google play music here's how it works
you you unlock it and the pin is
something very easy for her to remember
and then you press music and then you
just type in any song any album it's
amazing you'd love it and then you press
play and then there's one tricky part
there's just one tricky part you have to
press cast cast and select kitchen and
living room yeah okay and I hadn't even
gotten to cast yet and she's like okay
hold on if I got to start writing this
down I'm like no no you don't have to
write it down because all you do is you
just turn it on which i think is
self-explanatory you press music which i
think is pretty self-explanatory and the
thing is is that she's not stupid it's
just that this is not a part of her life
not her wheelhouse and it never was no
and so coming back to Apple and this
particular strategy alright so I was
showing her how to use the Android phone
and look you just press the phone as a
picture of a phone and then you just key
in a number it's the same it's the same
she was really really tired that day and
she didn't want to deal with it so she
just left but we're gonna we're gonna
get we're gonna get there sure but the
point is Apple's typical user is
probably closer to my aunt than they are
to me the one thing that I will drop in
here is yeah Apple does have its own
enthusiast it oak white a few for sure
like a lot but I said typical user and I
and they're yes and I think the
enthusiast population is a sliver of a
sliver of a sliver of a niche yeah they
can't really exist but yeah yeah but
they absolutely do I mean I would even
go as far as to say that there are no
fewer at
mobile enthusiasts than there are
Android mobile enthusiasts it would be
incorrect to say that Android is the OS
for mobile enthusiasts yeah
wrong I just wanted to let us go down
that road for a second so people hadn't
freaked out in the comments or something
of course you do and of course you are
and that's fine yeah I'm not the point
the point is that the typical user
typically is it that's why I
specifically call that oneplus not
Android in general although they're
going more mainstream they're in
t-mobile now so the only weird literally
thousands of stores worldwide worldwide
excuse me uh nationwide in the US yeah
that are going to be pushing the oneplus
60 mmm oh my god good for you guys
that's cool anyway um so back to the
typical user I suspect being either
notice nor care in a lot of cases
because you gotta remember even the the
more normy users online are still
probably more connected because like
even people who don't care about smart
functionality at all like who might not
even have a data plan they're still
buying smart phones these days because
where are you gonna get a flip uh you
can't get them you can get them but
they're like kind of garbage yeah
they're like actually disposable phones
yeah in most cases so I was thinking the
other day if I didn't if I didn't have
the work that I currently have yeah
because the vast majority of the time
that I'm on my phone is for work you'd
be a drug dealer how does this tie in to
flip phones I honestly wouldn't use very
much on the phone yeah
and like I could actually pretty easily
get by with the flip phone and maps I
really like maps I'm having a really
hard time with my pixel three Excel
review because I don't typically use
canned benchmarks to measure battery
life because my usage is pretty
consistent like the way that I use my
phone except that a few days into my
pixel 3 Excel review I kind of made an
early New Year's resolution to stop
consuming political news and probably a
good 50 to 60% of my screen time was
like political news
for that so I ended the day yesterday
with 82% on my pixel three XL battery
because Google does a great job of idle
battery management on the pixel lineup
for sure yep I barely touch my phone
like it's crazy over the last few years
it used to be I couldn't go five minutes
without getting a phone call or a text
are you sure that's entirely because the
political thing or is that because you
don't like the experience so much that
you're just using it less okay it's
there's a little bit of me not liking
the experience that much but I also
definitely yeah because I know you did
that I have cut down my consumption yeah
should I forget where I was going before
that's that's fine yeah someone in chat
just said don't forget flips are used
for tough environments yeah they've got
some pretty rugged smartphones these
days too though just throwing that out
there
yes all right so let's let's finish up
here Apple's position is iPhone 8 in
later use a more advanced don't you love
that they don't call it the iPhone and
iPhone
it's iPhone like it's a person or
something I'm not gonna do it the iPhone
8 and later use a more advanced hardware
and software design that provides a more
accurate estimation of both power needs
and the battery's power capability to
maximize overall system performance this
allows a different performance
management system that more precisely
allows iOS to anticipate and avoid an
unexpected shutdown as a result the
impacts of performance management may be
less noticeable on iPhone the iPhone 8
and later so I'm gonna chat said Casey
Mac in the YouTube chat I'm trying to
pay a little bit of attention to both I
said I can't believe Linus covered an
iPhone that's a very confusing statement
yeah I've been doing iPhone reviews for
literally years yeah four years or
something even iMac and MacBook yep an
iPad yep and I have even given some very
positive iPhone reviews yeah they just
don't come out oh right yeah there's
that it mean it's once a year and we
don't like we don't like hang on and do
like iPhone video after iPhone video
yeah we've kind of cover it at launch
and then we consider that sort of good
enough yeah I'm just like I mean
basically any other product but like I
mean we're not like an iPhone review
channel which is sort of a thing I don't
know this
this has been a very frustrating thing
for me over the last little while so I
did that one video where I talked about
all the things I didn't like about the
iPhone 10s and I still do yeah yeah and
I'm still not gonna use it as my daily
driver but it's not because I hate Apple
or that I hate the iPhone 10s it's just
I don't think it's the best choice and
I'm a tech reviewer I can use literally
any device I want and if I can then I
will use something else but I also don't
deci I say I don't hate them first oh
right yeah oh yeah yeah this was bizarre
so then because I did feel like that
particular piece like I think even if my
personal preference is the wrong way not
to use an iPhone 10s it doesn't mean I
hate it and I think my original piece
was overly negative and so we were
already planning to do a counterpoint
piece 10 which is that are great about
the iPhone which is a cool idea when
both of those pieces are opinion pieces
anyways they're not reviews um yeah
neither of them were reviews to be very
clear and it feels like our community
was was split in Twain and you know half
the comments on the initial piece are
that I'm clearly paid off by Google or
Samsung or whoever else the case may be
because I'm just trashing the iPhone and
then half the comments on the iPhone one
or that Apple clearly sent a big bucket
of money for us to say positive things
with the iPhone I'd like to set this
clear once and for all so that it can
never be it can never be forgotten or
misunderstood again if we were paid for
something you would know because it
would say sponsored by the name of
whoever gave the money for it been kind
of doing it forever in the video it's
happened a lot and we would say verbally
sponsored by or thanks to or whatever
whatever it is to be very clear is it
also in the description yes so it's on
screen its verbally said and it's in the
description Apple has never paid us to
do anything and they have never even
accepted a phone call or an email so no
that didn't happen what happened was
that they're just products they're just
phones and laptops and motherboards
that's all they are there is no there is
no tribe that you join by buying a
product
I mean okay I shouldn't say that because
they're kind of is but I reject that
reality and I substitute my own because
it's ridiculous
I agree someone in chat brought up a
pretty good point that you are paid off
my blackberry I am obviously yeah or
else you wouldn't have the opinion of
being against both sides we have figured
out the conspiracy well I don't have to
be paid they're just my Canadian bro
sort of license to TCL javi when when
was the last time we covered a black
high reading of the key - oh yeah quite
recently actually and it you don't get a
good reviews not getting a great valu
know quite frankly I I think I I am I am
I am setting myself up for another wave
of hate right now so I just mostly
finished almost finished the script for
my pixel three XL review and it is
pretty negative yeah well you know what
I was talking about I said for months I
was just gonna buy pixel three when it
came out and I haven't yet and I still
got my one and it's feeling really old
sorry I have a note 9 in my pocket right
now because I just finished my script
for the pixel 3 I forgot I'm not
actually carrying it anymore but there's
just a handful of things that are just
shockingly stupid so one have you bought
the have you got the nougat Oreo pie yes
have you got the pie update yet yes yeah
okay did you notice that when you are
watching a video for example and you
click the volume rocker of everything
that did to volume is horrible
okay just just checking yeah so I have a
whole like thing on audio management in
Android pie and oh it's unbelievably
absolute garbage shockingly stupid I
have missed an obscene amount of calls
because I go to lower the volume and it
lowers the freaking call volume oh
that's interesting so I have observed on
my pixel 3xl that the default system
behavior when you're not doing anything
is now to adjust media volume rather
than ringer volume let's see let's see
what happens with yours but it's it's
not a single occasion this has happened
over periods of time
so I basically I'm gonna go off on a
fair number of things and I think the
Android / Google fanboys are gonna
figure I'm paid off by Apple or whatever
the case may be but the reality of it is
is that to me these are just products
they're just glass metal and plastic and
so if they're really lovely then they're
really lovely and if they're really not
and they're really not and that's all
there really is to it so I'm not on sets
anymore
so I never want my call volume silenced
sure it's silenced right now are you
accidentally mashing your lock and your
volume up because that's a gesture it's
very unlikely well it's a gesture on the
pixel 3xl I don't know if it's on this
one here you got to turn it like turn it
up and then hit it yeah that's probably
what you do but then if you press it
again it does so I rant about that too
oh my god that's probably happening in
my pocket just all the time
wire calls just permanently muted like I
can't and it doesn't make them vibrate
and I changed the the the interaction so
that supposed to vibrate when ringing
and it still just doesn't know so I'm
bracing myself for the hate storm but
I'm at the point now where I just kind
of don't even care because they're like
the number of people that said they
unsubscribed over that iPhone video was
like if you read the comments it was
probably similar to the number of people
that claim they unsubscribed over the
what was that company that did the
benchmarking for Intel again hmm I don't
meant something I can't remember yeah it
has something to do with like justified
or or remember anyway yeah neither of
those days even registered as blips so I
I don't know it seems to be either vocal
minorities or I don't know I don't uh
something technologies oh dang and I
can't remember anyway why don't we get
into our sponsors fresh books fresh

P IA check it out today at the link in

internet.com / pages / - - tech - tips
secure your internet and stuff no no I
know we weren't doing any talking pause
try throwing it like a yo know you
roomed it young kids fellow schoolers
fellow fellow -
Liss you should secure your interwebs
like surfing the net surfing it's been a
long time is that a thing do people
still say don't think so okay
everything web surfing it seems to be
happening a lot lately like someone I
forget who it was but and this is okay
look it's a direct quote and I'm sorry
for that I have to say it but it was
like someone said something and someone
replied with well your mom's gay and I
was like I had this like okay you know
breath of the wild when you find the
memories and it's like links like I was
like transported back to the locker room
in grade 8 you know yeah I was like
those are words that I haven't heard
together and didn't miss by the way in
15 years and so I feel like this is part
of Aging because I'm experiencing it a
lot lately surfing the web so the more
you get older the more you become like a
new link I'm just oh no right
have you finished that game yet no I am
close really it's gonna take me a long
time I don't go on as many trips anyway
I only played on trips I was horrified
to discover that the switch has a
feature that tells you how many hours
you've spent in a game and I wanted a
chair how much is it and there's some
idling okay sure but not much okay
my total playtime for that game is over
130 hours whoa I have officially spent
more time playing breath of the wild in
the last six months since I got a switch
I didn't even get a switch until I had
my wisdom teeth out that's probably more
than I was like not all games you've
played in the last few years combined
yeah yeah probably like
not counting when I'm like benchmarking
or whitter yeah yeah that's so I have
almost literally every armor in the game
except the Soraa helmet I'm not sure
where you get it it might be like it
might be you have to find like the ten
things and I didn't feel like doing it
or something like that like there's a
couple of quests I haven't finished I
have my champions tunic completely
upgraded which is a real pain in the
butt and I have only looked up two
things have you done like the challenge
islands and stuff DLC yeah oh wait no I
haven't done the DLC I've only done the
one challenge island that's like already
there so haven't done any DLC at all and
I've only looked up two things so far
and one of them I feel like a complete
idiot about so in the whatever the clan
is called the Heike clan or something
Hyuga clan or something like that i
can't remember what it's called but in
the the clan's headquarters i did that
dungeon like nine times getting to the
end where have you done it don't like so
okay well whatever there's a dungeon
where you're supposed to use I have a
long time ago yeah you're supposed to
use Magni sis to open a secret door and
the hint is that the room has a bunch of
treasure chests like buried embedded in
the ground that by that point in the
game I think they've assumed you know
that you can grab them out with magnesia
so you're supposed to turn it on and see
the hidden door I had not figured out
that game mechanic yet and I just didn't
think to turn it on even though I'd done
a bunch of shrines like I knew that like
it was probably a matter of just
something like that so I did it all
these times I finally I was just like
screwed I looked up felt like a complete
idiot and then the other one I looked up
was the xenoblade chronicles like
crossover quest or something like that
and the hint is you got to go to the top
of the snow the split snowy mountain
peak and there's a snowy mountain peak
that has a huge sword embedded in it and
I went to that one and I stared into the
night sky like you're supposed to for a
very long time I was like this is really
stupid I need to know if this is right
and it turns out it was another one
where the peak was like kind of split
with a thing that's like you know what I
don't even care because I solved that
riddle
ulocal was bad yeah no no so I don't
even feel bad about that one but that's
it like everything else I have figured
out on my own for better or for worse so
it has taken a very long time and then
sometimes I'll drop in I'll spend an
entire flight just accomplishing nothing
just like going around and finding
seeds and crap like that so I do like my
brain off travel mode thing I only play
on flights and yeah pretty much only
flights actually I almost never play
when I'm actually there but so when the
game first came out I got a good amount
of time on it yeah and then almost
immediately it was like nope I have
traveled so much this year yeah it's
been stupid um anyway uh which if you're
at IEM Chicago say hi trusted reviews
pays a million pounds after Red Dead
Redemption to leaks so this is where I
need to I need to plead ignorance and
say look we're gonna walk through what
we have in our notes and I'm gonna tell
you my knee-jerk reaction and it might
be wrong okay trusted reviews has pulled
an article published in February 2018
that was earlier this year that revealed
unannounced gameplay details about Red
Dead Redemption 2 and they have donated
a 1 million pound settlement fee to
charities of rockstars choice at the
time the website said it received the
documents in August 2017 but decided not
to share them as they were
unsubstantiated however in February 2018
after the information was validated by
official promotional material trusted
reviews went ahead with the story
stating it had contacted Rockstar for
comin ok
the link to the article has now been
replaced by an apology we published an
article that was sourced from a
confidential corporate document we
should have known this information was
confidential and should not have
published it we unreservedly apologize
to take to games and we have undertaken
not to repeat such actions again we have
also agreed to donate over a million
pounds to charities chosen by take-two
games what am I missing something here
I'm really lost because if they had
illegally obtained the documents which
they haven't said that they did and in
fact it's not in our notes but I believe
they said that they were provided by an
anonymous source for free which is how
sourcing for rumor mill stories happens
um what exactly is going on here so uh
yeah twitch twitch chat why don't we
talk to twitch chat ah everyone else
seems to be confused I like and yeah
yeah so what did you call a cat or
whatever your name is I don't know yeah
I think you're a prime subscriber so
cool that's neat
if someone leaked a confidential
document that's on them not the reporter
yes as far as I'm aware it works the
same way in the UK which is where this
whole thing took place as it does here
where if you don't have an NDA and you
don't have any other kind of
confidentiality agreement or a legal
obligation it's completely not your
problem so like did they have some
partnership agreement of some kind or
something like their mutt there must be
something else going on that we don't
know yeah because if they like if they
stole the documents like if reporters
from not shoot who was it again I
trusted review yeah if reporters from
trusted reviews like literally donned
ninja outfits and snuck into the Red
Dead Redemption to like development
studio and stole documents that's
illegal
if somebody else stole the documents and
provided them without them buying stolen
goods you don't want to pay for stolen
goods okay but if someone just provided
them free of charge to my knowledge
that's not illegal for trusted reviews
so I am not getting anyone yeah see this
is another thing rubia says I'm more
surprised that trusted reviews has a
million pounds to donate I've been a
parent company yeah professor use is
owned by crap I I can't remember but I
was I was doing a little bit of research
into this before the show actually Wow
it does happen from time
time cuz I was just like what is going
on right now I do not understand this
I just what if it was confidential there
could have been something in their Terms
of Service enforceable like I remember
having this argument with Luke where I
was like look on all of our email
signatures we need to have that
confidentiality for your eyes only if
they are the unintended recipient we
please delete this and he's like those
are completely unenforceable this is
stupid now look look I don't care
sometimes it's about scare tactics
rather than the actual we did it anyways
because useless okay fine look I'm not
digging this debate back up I mean I put
it on my new email from time to time I'm
correct it's CloudFlare who was right
okay all right okay he didn't even want
to contact them he was like no that's
not gonna work to be fair they have
failed us more than a few times but in
general it was like there is no way to
fix this problem I'm like I google it
I'm like contact these guys know call
them
I had to issue like an executive order
to call those
yep no now its defense this is an
example that I love to bring up because
it looks like the time that I was right
about something like super technical and
or like Network administration admin the
crap there's like my one time to shine
so I love bringing it up he's usually I
immediately looked up yeah way to get
around their security which is why I was
like what the hell but most of the stuff
that happens in that realm is automated
anyways and it's very good at blocking
all that guys and very often it's hard
to do anyways anyway so in a nutshell we
still don't know what the craps going on
other than like the only thing that I
can really come up with is that they're
trying to avoid damaging the
relationship with take two but then
doctor one helluva here's where it gets
a
deeper to me how is that relationship
worth a million paths yeah right like
that's one hell of a try to fix this
relationship yeah like I could even see
like okay let's say um picket tech
company like you're not talking like
Intel Nvidia anyone go with gigabyte
gigabyte okay pic gigabyte if we did
something that really screwed over
gigabyte real good like you know they we
somehow obtained their roadmap for their
upcoming graphics cards that they had an
NDA with Nvidia four or something and we
did a story on it that got them in a
whole bunch of trouble and they were
like yo man like this is terrible you
know you basically just got us you got
us cut off from Nvidia our company's
revenue is gonna be down 20% next year
what the heck man like I could see us
being like okay here's no actually I
know I still know why would we do that
that's stupid that's ridiculous okay um
so fine who's the ownership again I
think it's time its TI media who I think
owns like okay time and stuff okay so
what is this rugby world shooting
Gazette oh sorry I screwed that up
wallpaper asterisk women at home what's
on TV uncut shooting something shooting
times now boat owner I never ever do
this stuff any of home and garden that's
that filming Gardens I've heard ideal
home golf monthly I haven't looked at a
magazine and so long that one seems like
old print magazines okay so that kind of
makes me hotter
daddy 25 beautiful homes is the name of
one of their brands okay well at any
rate okay so I guess they're a big deal
so they clearly have a million pounds to
throw around and apparently it was worth
making this go away to them somehow yeah
alright cool um
it's all I really have to say about that
why don't we go ahead and um I feel like
TI media needs to use like Squarespace
or something because their websites are
kind of dirt look at this tiny little
bar at the top
massive freaking image you have to
scroll down a bit before you get past it
and then finally information that's kind
of like a trendy thing though it's there
was some like weird computer company or
something that I was on their website
and it just like had all it was was like
embedded videos and I was like no no no
you need to have text on your website
yeah
all right let's do a few super chats
dari says Burke Burke I'm a dog
what would your for Sona be if you were
a furry I'd be go I don't a wolf a bear
Oh careful
Oh I'm Kurt 101 says love the content
keep it up man where it says review it
not sure what you're talking about
anymore Eric that was a long time ago
presume that's probably the Walmart PC
oh yes Hassam says can we have an actual
blindfold build actually we are working
on that a Corrupter it says thanks to
the runner and those working behind the
scenes glad to save such a worthy cause
with this donation towards viewers
Choice oh yeah we haven't been viewers
choice in a long time Ali says Dada da
no da B that's not dad notice though
that is Deb but what you want is daddy
again is that this one yeah okay but
there's some micro dab thing now where
it's like smaller or something I don't
know maybe I don't know I don't follow
these things very well
Arctic Ross's gaming PC I don't even
trust Walmart for food
ouch dang haymaker hello Linus isn't my
first dream it's midnight here in the UK
you're probably not watching anymore
then well at any rate high in the u k--
in the wall and the UK wal-mart is
called Asda do they have a UK like thing
well done that was a great workout since
my watch
brilliant mike says how you guys doing
I'm good Paul says I always thought they
wanted our og to sound like rogue ha
nope
it was much dumber than that gorlice
says nothing
hi guerilla tom says assembling a gaming
pc isn't really skilled labor you'd be
surprised how bummed up that can get
again
blind build a PC blindfold it sounds
like a video yeah it sounds like it at
this point scooby-doo says can you do
wired and wireless Wi-Fi wired and
wireless Wi-Fi cards please
can you do a wired and wireless Wi-Fi
cards please clemmy's reviews Asda is
owned by Walmart it is not it's not like
technically Walmart but it's a
subsidiary of warming we don't really
review Wi-Fi cards unfortunately - TLDR
you're knowledgeable but sometimes your
voice annoys me after extensive amounts
of time I've worked out that what no no
no this is a thing this is absolutely
but work on that you're gonna go like
voice coaching you know what I actually
did experiment with it for a little bit
so I there was a video that I hosted
when I was like really sick and my voice
was super low and there were like a
bunch of comments about I was like okay
you know what why don't we try hosting
my videos like this for a little while
and it's it's not it like it's obviously
still my voice but it's a little bit
less shrill like it's not like what yeah
I don't like it overall the feedback was
negative yeah yeah cuz it doesn't sound
like you I don't know especially on a
review channel I think the genuineness
is important Noah says you're awesome
hope to see LTX in the USA soon probably
not but LTX this coming year just to
give you guys some idea how seriously
we're taking it I have issued a
directive as of yesterday that the
person who's going to be organizing LTX
which will probably be Colton's wife
Steph needs to start full-time like now
like seven months prior like I want it
to be way better this year cool yeah
not that it was terrible but there was
like a lot of noticeable room for
improvement yes but it was very good it
was very fun event but there was a lot
of like okay yeah shout out to Mike
Adams
holy smokes how are there so many super
chats dreck says please review some
Nubia X the double screen phone ah man
I'm so tired of reviewing phones right
now it is so boring I think that's why
they're all turning into rants I'll get
back to you on that one
laser says I love my moto Z force with
an add-on battery okay Michael says why
don't people buy the lower end phones
new from Apple it's not like the new
phones are much noticeably faster yes
but
the support period like I would pay an
extra couple by the time you're paying
six $700 for a phone you're gonna use
for with two years of support why not
pay eight $900 for one with three and a
half years there's also like even if
it's new you still get the software
slowdown right no only once your battery
degrades okay all right
I think that's pretty much all I got
thank you guys we will see you again
next week same bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
