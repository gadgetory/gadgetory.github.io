our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys welcome to something very
exciting here guys we have Gabe rushan
who is the president CEO whatever title
he wants to give himself of Swift tech
now normally when I do these videos you
guys know I know a thing or two about
water cooling so I would normally do all
the talking but this guy makes
everything I know look kind of stupid so
I'm gonna let him do most of the talking
about their brand new product in fact a
few brand new products that according to
the conversation we've had and the demo
slicks already seen is going to just
blow the doors off of the prefabbed
water cooling market well we're gonna
try to yes well what we have here is the
h2 20 C PU liquid cooling system and
that product is the intention of that
product is to bridge the gap between
all-in-one and three level budget
products such as those made by thermal
take on take off and all of these guys
and the custom loop systems what we are
offering here is the ability we offer a
product that is pre filled entirely
plug-and-play for novice builders where
they only have two it only comes already
pre-installed with the fans and all they
have to do is stick it up the top of the
case and screw in the four screws for
the CPU cooler and they are essentially
done it comes guys we've never seen this
before
rather than having you fuss around with
the stupid fans and the screws and they
go through the case and the thing and
you got to align it it comes with the
wires already kind of tied away for you
so the cable management is sort of done
the fans are pre attached to the unit so
you actually don't have to bother with
that you just screw it into your case
and even this is pre attached so it's
just a matter of undoing a couple screws
and doing a couple screws back in
so sorry no problem no problem now the
unit is plug-and-play
and we use included with this unit is an
eight-way PWM speeder I'm sorry yeah so
you just connect your pump and your fans
to this this one goes to the CPU header
on the motherboard and this goes to the
power supply
and now your motherboard sees the entire
CPU cooler as just a regular air-cooled
Intel stock core and can manage it just
the same way couple of you know couple
of settings in the motherboard and now
your system is entirely managed by the
motherboard now guys remember something
like an M cubed T balancer would have
been required to have the level of
control we're gonna have over the number
of fans we're gonna have because we're
adding power from the power supply we
don't have to worry about the
limitations of what the header is
capable of providing we're relying on
the PSU for that and because guys like a
soos are including fan expert in their
AI suite now you can take setting custom
fan curves which you always had a
limitation how many how many headers you
have on the motherboard did they give
you PWM did they give you 3 pin now you
can do eight you can just mount it with
two screws or if you really don't feel
like it you don't want to DIY this at
all you can just stick it to the your
case with tape comes with beautiful
sleeving on it so you can see you can
hardly see the color of the wires behind
that at all Gabe go ahead take no
problem the last thing but most
important thing in the static
presentation here is that pump when I
say we wanted to bridge the gap between
onion 1 and custom cooling loops we
needed a pump and we have for the past 3
years worked on that pump we now
manufacture that pump in our own factory
ok and we've designed it from the ground
up that pump is 6 watts ok
compare this for reference to the other
all-in-one systems that have a pump
rated at about 1.2 watts so it is 6
times more powerful than other
all-in-one systems which means that we
are capable of driving multiple devices
in the loop
for any custom loop and we will show
that later on during that presentation
also that pump because we've spent so
much time in developing it has an
excellent MTBF which is the reliability
the measure of reliability that pump is
rated for 60,000 hours and TBF whereas
the mCP 35 X that we use in the apogee
drive for example is 50,000 hours but
notice something else notice that the
base of these two units is actually
exactly the same it is the same copper
base so you're gonna get the same type
of thermal performance from this product
that you get from the mCP 30 or from the
apogee drive - which retails for over
$110 guys something that I want to talk
about a little bit here as well is the
fact that if you've ever watched any of
my videos about Swift tech products I
know we don't do too much on custom
water cooling cuz it's kind of well it
used to be kind of nice I guess here we
are is that their mounting mechanism our
mounting mechanisms are second to none
they've always done a phenomenal job I
think even going back to I'd say
probably the last one that was somewhat
difficult to mount would have been a
poogie Apogee was a little bit that was
a long time ago with a lot of the the
later prod I'm even anything in the last
four or five years it's been down to a
spec where there's tensions here that
are calibrated specifically for the
Intel specification they always pay
special attention to this when other
water cooling manufacturers in ages past
have been cheating by actually applying
too much pressure in a bow to the base
and kind of funny tricks like this Swift
tech goes with the stock mount it's
always got a stopper you see the way if
I unscrew that it actually goes right up
against the back plate you can never
accidentally screw a swift tech block in
too far if you have anything that
they've manufactured in the last few
years so move on to the rest I think the
static presentation is done let's what
fittings oh I forgot sorry yeah it's
because for me now it's I've taken them
for granted
well we've installed we've designed
these products with swivel fittings so
that it makes it absolutely very easy to
install the unit into a case and to bend
the tube we also have very specific and
sweet tubing that is very nice to work
with it is relatively soft but it works
without kinking and so the fact that
it's a little softer than usual allows
it's more comfortable to work with the
century so it doesn't put too much
strain on the fittings and anything like
that and obviously the fact that they're
all swivel essentially makes it so easy
to install
so expansion wise remember we mentioned
our well Gabe mentioned that there is a
there's a pump that's capable of driving
more components than just the CPU so you
take these off as simply as undoing a
Phillips head screwdriver no nonsense no
trickery they're not trying to prevent
you from emptying the thing and doing
your own thing with it because swift
acts a custom water cooling company not
you know a heat sink company turned
water cooling company you can drain this
thing you can make a custom loop out of
it if you want it really does bridge the
gap between DIY and not DIY you can also
see here that there's a flange that
prevents this custom this custom clamp
from actually going in this direction
and you can see right here that it's
manufactured to a precision that it's
actually not capable of slipping in the
other direction as well and much like
the CPU block itself this goes down all
the way so when you install any
component in this kit you screw it in
all the way now I like to think that I'm
pretty credible as far as sources of
information go and I told you guys that
gave is extremely credible but obviously
if we're gonna tell you something like
blow the doors off of or if we're gonna
tell you something like you know huge
mean time between failure and so much
more powerful than every other pump
whatever whatever we're telling you we
better sort of prove it so this is the
practical demo component right now we
have three identical systems running
competitor t competitor C and Swift Tech
so that represents the OEMs that are out
there so there's an ASA tech premium
unit there's a kulit premium unit and
there is a swift tech premium unit
because there is no om
a swift tech all-in-one water cooling
unit so Gabe tell us what you've done to
level the playing field in such a way
that we are seeing how they compare it
directly to each other well what we're
doing here is that we have three plus
one since we are also showing the h2o
with graphics screen capabilities but
essentially what we're doing for the CPU
cooling section the asset the asset tag
the cursor on the swift tag is that we
let huh we let the system run at 1,400
rpms which is the lowest level we can go
to with both the Thermaltake and the
cross air units and we placed the Swift
tech unit also at 1400 it can go lower
it can go from 800 to 18 but we put them
all at 1400 we put the same load we have
the same of a clock they're all running
at 4.6 Geeks same voltage which is set
by the OneTouch button on the asus
software guys these are 3770k is running
on Maximus 5 formulas just so you know
yes I also want to thank a sous and
their beautiful board for sponsoring
this as well as the Nokia for sponsoring
the cases and EVGA for sponsoring the
graphics and Kingston for the hyper axe
and SSDs they have been beautiful in
helping us as well as Coolermaster for
all these beautiful power supplies that
are running nice and low
ok now going back to the set up 1,400
rpms for all four systems so three CPU
cooling and 1 h2 220 running as well two
gtx 680 s provided by EVGA using the
hydro copper cooler as well as the via
cooling on the Asus so we are all loaded
up let's go take a look at the
temperature results now let's go guys
we're not even gonna cut this shot
because I want you guys to see that
there's no monkey business going on so
where do we where do we see all four of
them here right here
laptop right there all right so here we
go guys so system one which is the here
we go the sweep deck age 220 here we
have the average for the past ten
minutes okay
in the right hand side column here and
the average temperature for the past 10
mins it's 76 81 at full load the same
lord same operations same fan speed
cursor h 100 is running at eighty two
point five compared to seventy six point
eight the thermal tech unit we can see
here is running at seventy eight point
three versus 276 and then the swift a
cage 220 also cooling two gtx 680 s and
the chipset and via which gets pretty
hot and a full load CPU is running at an
average of eighty one point three
centigrades so now that now that we've
covered the temperatures we are going to
cover maximum noise level as well as
minimum noise levels so let's get
started with maximum maximum noise level
on the swift take h 220 and let me just
explain how i'm gonna position the
microphone here guys
rather than positioning it right next to
the vent where it's going to be mostly
the noise of the air brushing up against
our windscreen i'm gonna position it
right here on the other side of this
flat because that way we're finding out
more accurately how much noise is
actually being transmitted through the
case to an end-user agree with this okay
we're gonna start with swift tech
next we're gonna move over to this was
the yes this is the go CH 100 I okay
I think that's all we need to know and
now let's move to the thermal tech unit
so Diesel's comment he's he's monitoring
the sound in his ear buds is that that's
a big difference so this is representing
the maximum noise that these units can
make so now what we are going to do to
demonstrate the minimums the minimum
noise level we're shutting down
everything else and we're going to keep
that CPU h2 20 C P you calling at it's
what we call the silent mode which is a
minimum fan speed and minimum pump speed
and it still at full load and you can
hear it humming so that's still that's
at 800 rpm right and regular regular
viewers know that I refuse to run fans
any higher than a thousand rpm so this
is pretty much how I'd use the unit
gonna cheat a little bit I'm gonna put
it even closer I'm gonna put it right
next to the vent diesel can't hear it
I'm gonna put it right next to the rear
fan very impressive so you know the
proof is in the pudding right and that's
all we have to say about this show me
show me the most impressive pudding
which is the one over there here because
we wanted to bridge that gap with the
custom custom custom loops right so
built starting from the h2 20 we added a
couple of Radeon 7970 is cooled by a
komodo water block and then we had hid a
couple more radiators so we have dual
120 millimeter it's an MC r 220 and we
have a dual 140 millimeter which is the
MC r 240 in the phone so that pump of
ass is honing to water blocks three
water blocks cpu GPU and three radiators
which demonstrates pretty much what the
enthusiast guys do out there and it's
capable of doing it and now if you want
to take a shot
on the screen you can see the type of
temperatures that we have running the
heaven benchmark and here we go guys
so GPU temperatures are 53 degrees for
479 70s which is ridiculous and then CPU
temperatures are under this is this is
an overclocked 3930k to 4.5 gigahertz so
guys temperatures of under 50 degrees 50
degrees on that CPU very very impressive
have you got that diesel oh he says no
not yet you know we could we got to
prove it here we can't just say it we
got to show you guys what kind of
temperatures were running and I just
want to thank I want to thank Gabe from
Swift tech for walking us through this
demo this has been very impressive and
very eye-opening thank you thank you
