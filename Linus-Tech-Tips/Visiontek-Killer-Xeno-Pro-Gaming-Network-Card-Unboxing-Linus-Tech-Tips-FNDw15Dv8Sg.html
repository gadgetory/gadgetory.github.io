killer Zeno Pro this is a vision tech
card now Bigfoot networks the creators
of the killer Nick used to be the only
board manufacturer that they authorized
to produce their killer gaming network
cards but vision tech has been brought
on board to produce a xeno Pro gaming
card now Bigfoot claims that you can get
up to 40% faster performance in online
games and 27% smoother frame rates this
card does include a copy of EverQuest to
the shadow Odyssey if you are so
inclined you will need okay here we go
you will need a PCI Express 1x slot on
your motherboard and high-speed Internet
access via cat5 in order to make use of
this card so let's open it up and while
I'm opening the box here I'm just gonna
sort of give you guys a little bit of
background on just exactly why we have
this killer gaming network card we are
going to be doing a test on NCIX tech
tips so not on my video blog but on my
my sort of more professional channel
where we will be comparing the killer
Nick side-by-side in two identical core
i5 based gaming systems running
EverQuest two to see if we can isolate
exactly where the performance
improvement comes from so that's gonna
be coming up in the next little while
and if I've already done it I'll be
putting in an annotation to give you the
link to go visit it anyway
let's find out what comes in the box
here so it has a one-year warranty and
the first thing you'll find inside the
box is the killer is you know oh let's
take it out actually let's see the
accessories first sorry I'm gonna make
you guys wait okay there's the
accessories so inside we will find a
killer Zeno Pro gaming network card
drivers disk as well as oh no you can't
see that as well as our EverQuest to
download and CD key ok and then we have
the Quick Start Guide of their software
version 5.0 point 2.0 and actually I
would definitely recommend you download
the latest software off of Bigfoot
networks
site ok that's interesting so what was
it ok well let's get some card itself in
so pull this baby out so at the bottom
of the card they've done away with the
old classic huge metal k heatsink that
we used to see on these things so we
find a couple of RAM chips we find the
killer NPU or network processing unit
itself here's our PCI Express 1x
interface and then let's flip the card
over to the back where we will find not
a whole lot but it is tested to comply
with FCC standards so that's terrific
okay on the back of the card we will
find a Gigabit Ethernet port so that's
where that's where most of the business
of this card is done then we'll find a
USB port now killer does support the use
of third-party apps that can make use of
this hardware so for example these ports
the microphone and headphone jacks can
be made use of by some voice chat
programs like mumble to reduce the
latency in those as well as in your
games and to offload the audio
processing completely from your CPU or
your sound card to the killer NIC itself
and the USB port can be used I believe
for storage devices as well as many
other uses now thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the killer
xeno pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
