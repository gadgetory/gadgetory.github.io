external hard drive case and virtual
drive that actually kind of reminds me
of like one of my favorite games on the
Sega Genesis which was virtual eraser
you know when it turns on it says that
VR loved that game anyway this is the
zmv e 300 USB 3 super speed OneTouch
backup and safe remove all come on if it
doesn't have safe removal then it's
probably not USB 3 compliant but One
Touch backup is useful easy menu
navigation using jog shuttle ok cool
USB 3 max five gigabit per second what
else we got going on here we got a lot
of different languages for where's the
English I found it
ok virtual Oh didi that's cool vertical
virtual optical disk drive so what that
means is you can actually to my
understanding mount ice our load ISOs on
to this particular external drive and
run them over USB 3 without any optical
drive whatsoever so you can take your
whole library of whether it's like you
know tech Isis or whatever else you turn
the whole this drive into a virtual USB
cd-rom drive that contains all of the
disks that you need that sounds like
actually kind of magical very cool
OneTouch backup and safe removal
convenient intuitive menus soon 1/2 inch
SATA one or two hard drive compatible
although you could probably throw a SATA
3 drive in there if you really want to
it just wouldn't be running at that
speed aluminum body for enhanced cooling
an elegant design plug and play use the
installation stuff come back to design
convenient travel pouch provided that's
actually very nice-looking ok we'll get
to that after software download the
latest from Sultan
USB 3 cable download the latest from
Zalman now you better use this there you
go so there's all your USB 3 pins and
there's all your other more different
USB 3 pins remember USB 3 is backwards
compatible so if you do want to plug in
a USB 2 cable you'll just have to find
one of these guys so that's what's that
a micro USB I think it's micro USB and
then it'll run in USB 2 includes a soft
feeling but hard on the outside
is almond carrying case which you can
still see Oh
oh that's neat so you can still access
the interface and the power button and
the activity led as well as the LCD
readout but it's protected me quick
guide showing you presumably some stuff
whoops that's not what I meant
- okay then shows you how to install the
backup utility to use ah here this is
what I really want to know so here's the
jog switch previous file select file to
the next file okay you can switch
between OD d mode and hard drive mouth
okay here's what I want to know to use
the virtual optical disk drive iso file
must be located in the underscore iso
folder the device and turn to or free
from menu if jog switches press for
three seconds back from cool so that's
how to use it that's fairly
straightforward actually look at this
they include a screwdriver and screws to
install the drive inside there ve 300
enclosures so let's have a look at the
enclosure itself because for some people
these enclosures are you know they
should look nice I actually 100% agree
with that if I'm gonna carry around my
hard drive and have it sit somewhere it
might as well be one that looks kind of
decent especially because the cost
difference between like an inexpensive
let's you know what I'm just gonna say
it between a cheap hard drive enclosure
and a nice one actually isn't that much
it says remove film but I can they're
serious about protecting this LCD there
we go very nice very shiny there's your
LCD activity LED there's your jog switch
which can be pressed or toggled either
these directions there's your oh sorry
that's a backup button not a power
button it's just powered if it's powered
and there's your USB 3 interface which
goes a little sunlight back
AHA the brushed finish it is all on the
top you got your zolomon logos all new
cool innovations can you see the brush
Tunis of it yeah there you go
very nice the bottom has also got the
brushed miss going on and in terms of
disassembling the enclosure
ah nice look at this well how do I do
that you just kind of carefully you know
what let's install it right because I
think this is gonna be so quick that we
can do it in real time
okay so here we go I have a two and a
half inch drive that I'm going to
install in here oh no I'm just kidding
guys this this is a Seagate drive from
from a dead external hard drive it's a
one terabyte so that's why it's like
thicker than a standard tune a half inch
drive no I found a real Drive so this is
a momentous XT 750 gig and the reason
why I might use a momentous XT in an
external enclosure is safe for example I
ran steam off an external drive which by
the way I do that allows the Momentis XT
to use its caching features to cache
whatever games or applications that I
most frequently use on to the built-in
SSD so whatever files come up an awful
lot that is the benefit of having SSD
caching on an external drive and not
just on a boot drive so I may have put
this in the wrong way but here basically
you know what okay I might not put in
all the screws but here's basically what
you do you just peel up the the trim
here and then you install the screws and
then put the trim back so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the Soliman cool innovations now I
forget what it's called the model
numbers are tough for these things
ve 300 I don't forget to subscribe -
tech gets from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos sorry guys this is
so easy I could have done it in real
time you just plonk in the drive
throw this in and then the screw is
actually four oh now I've misplaced the
screwdriver oh there's the screw
actually just goes in here which locks
in the top piece which locks the drive
in place very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
