which doesn't sound like a lot but Acer
who sponsored this video by the way
thank you Acer is particularly proud of
what they've managed to pack in to their
eighth generation nitro 5 so let's crack
this bad boy open and have a look at it
shall we
all right so while I pack these boxes
open let's talk the specs of this thing
it's got a Core i5 processor which again
doesn't sound gaming or anything but if
you look a little closer at the specs
the 8th gen Core i5 8300 H which is what
this thing is equipped with is actually
nearly identical to the last generation
Core i7 7700 HQ which was kind of the de
facto standard for gaming laptops so
consider this over one generation we are
getting slightly better performance
actually and at a hundred and twenty
eight dollars less on the CPU alone so
that is a big part of why Acer was able
to hit this fairly aggressive price
point as for the rest of the specs it's
got eight gigs of RAM which as we talked
about recently for gaming anyway you
know I can't say anything for Chrome
users but for gaming anyway it's still
enough even in current year 2018 it's
got 256 gigs of SSD storage so we have
finally gotten to the point where even
for like value models like this one we
don't have to rely on a larger hard
drive in order to have enough space to
install a few games with the fact that
it's a PCI Express based SSD being an
extra bonus and it's got a gtx 1050 Ti
so the biggest difference between a 10
Series card like what we've got here and
the last generation 9 series geforce
cards is that it used to be that the
mobile version was a cut-down version of
what was in some cases not even the same
GPU at all so a 970 m for example was
actually a desktop 960 and then a 950 M
which would have been the like similar
position in the product stack to this
one was I don't even know what that
thing was
so the 1050 Ti is over a hundred percent
faster than the 950 M that you would
have gotten in an $800 laptop in years
past so the point I'm trying to make
here is that at this price with these
specs you're going to get a great
experience and eSports titles like
you'll be able to crank them and I'd be
surprised if you ever dropped a frame
and then even in triple-a titles you
should be able to drive this 1080p panel
at its native resolution at like medium
settings so all that's left here is for
us to uninstall norton you may have to
download norton consumer product removal
tool and go ahead and get some games
installed and steam so we can take it
for a test drive so i had to run and
grab a copy of doom off an external
drive because i don't feel like waiting
for 60 gigs to download which i guess is
a good time to talk about io because i
like having my mouse over on the left so
that it doesn't interfere with movement
on the mouse pad over on the right and
we've only got one USB 3 over on this
side of the type-a persuasion so i'm
gonna go ahead and use that second one
right in between the HDMI port we've got
an SD card reader and a regular wired
Ethernet port yay for my external drive
and then over on the other side we've
got power in two more USB ports though
it should be noted these are USB 2 and
then a headphone microphone combo jack
one thing that's noticeably better is
the display brightness so IPS displays
started showing up on value laptops what
about two years ago I guess but one of
the big issues that they had was that
while they have IPS qualities like
better colors and better viewing angles
they were typically really dim this
one's actually not too shabby no I don't
want the game bar like barely gives you
enough time to tell it to never come
back I'm gonna go with expert BOTS today
alright so we're running anywhere from
about 80 to 110 or so frames per second
damn these expert BOTS
oh crap they're all yes they're better
than me thank you I guess I could have
bought a better gun or I could just
okay now csgo okay well for tonight's
loading maybe we can just spend a little
bit of time with the keyboard actually
actually overall impressions of the
keyboard are not bad it's got a bit of a
long keystroke and that does take some
getting used to so I I found myself
missing a couple here and there but if
you're a heavier type er you probably
wouldn't even notice not bad really
quiet - lets apply the best settings for
our system here Battle Royale of course
does anyone play the other one
okay motions are off because terrible
yeah I was not expecting all hi - oh
okay it kind of settled in there so I'm
kind of a view distance guy I'm not I
don't really care about any alias
signals so let's go ahead and have a
look at how that looks
wait the ones with arrows are on my team
right I don't remember no that's not bad
like if your goal is you know do some
schoolwork and you're not expecting
crazy battery life because it does have
a dedicated graphics card and then play
fortnight in your off hours this is not
a bad experience can you harvest a car
evidently you can yeah you build stuff
let's say I'm harvesting brick right now
this is rock solid now it's not doing
any of that dipping or anything it's
actually not that loud either I think
it's you know it's not silent or
anything but it's very tolerable so
there you have it that's pretty much the
latest gen nitro 5 overall looking
pretty good for 800 bucks if you get it
from Best Buy we have really come a long
way actually so thanks for watching guys
