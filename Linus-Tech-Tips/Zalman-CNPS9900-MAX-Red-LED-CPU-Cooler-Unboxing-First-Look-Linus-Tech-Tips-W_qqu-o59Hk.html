these elements CMPs
9900 max which is over 9000 I just
thought I'd mention that this is the red
LED version fits on pretty much every
socket you could care about including
2011 FM one and am3+ which doesn't
apparently include LGA 1155 but we'll
see once we open I know there ya go they
were just messing with me 2011 1366 1156
1155 775 m 3 + + 3 M two + am to FM one
basically whatever CPU you have you can
put one of these on it and it will be
good composite key pipe Salomon's
pompously heat pipe features a sintered
metal type of wick resulting in
outstanding capillary pumping
performance a high thermal conductive
design of axial grooves which increases
the heat transfer rate by 50 percent
compared to ordinary Hugh is this is
there's this is more traditional types
and I'm going to tell you what's cool
about that because he pipes would rely
on gravity they would if they weren't
better designed than that
so Zalman is saying that they're better
than gravity reliance design is better
than other people's
better than gravity reliance design now
if you don't know a little something
about how he pipes work and I'm going to
do a short little lesson here that might
help you the way heat pipes work is they
have a liquid inside it can be water it
can be something else and the liquid
boils vaporizes and carries with it
liquid and heat up to the extremities of
the pipe where it then condenses and
flows back to the bottom where it'll get
heated up again as a liquid again this
is an extremely efficient way of moving
heat around however when you take it and
you install it in a case all of a sudden
you can't rely on you know just hotter
things rising helping and you can't rely
on gravity to carry the liquid back down
to the CPU so that is why there's
textures or patterns on the inside edges
of the heat pipe to carry the liquid
back to where it needs to be heated up
again so
can carry heat away from your CPU so
Zelman is basically saying their way of
doing that is more efficient so their
heat pipe will perform better than
others particularly in scenarios where
it's not going to be gravity assistance
if you have a desktop case where it's
going to sit like this honestly probably
makes no difference whatsoever but since
almost everyone is using a tower these
days it will probably be a factor for
you I've always liked zelmans mounting
mechanisms they tend to come with a lot
of pieces but they tend to also be very
flexible and once you get them on
they're very secure as well so let's not
look at what we've got included here in
terms of accessories fan resistor for
well the fan as well as a four pin
version so you got a three pin or four
pin version depending on what you want
to use you got some of their included
thermal goop Zen em STG - okay you've
got ha ha you've got an included tool so
you'll actually be able to install
something the stuff it was something
I've seen this before
ah these ones there you go so you got
like a little like ball and socket thing
going on here so you can actually screw
things in from a weird angle it's very
useful okay you've got your back plate
zolomon case badge you've got a non
conductive Lake no shield for that
AMD mounting hardware right here you got
your Intel mounting hardware right here
there's your 775 your 1156 your 1366 and
and I don't actually see the I guess one
of these is probably something to do
with it okay so it's a little
complicated comes with a lot of pieces
like I said usually very secure that's
what I've come to expect from them and
they've actually got everything very
very well laid out for you here until
clip AMD clip and
and all the installation instructions
will make it pretty straightforward this
is not like the what was it the enttec
cooler box which took me about 45
minutes to get installed on the
motherboard because it like things
entered like once you got it
starting to be installed things started
to interfere with each other and you
couldn't install it pretty tough so it's
kind of a neat way to pack this to make
sure that nothing gets bent you know so
the fins don't fins don't get damaged so
the heat pipes don't get bent so it's
got a total of six heat pipes here guys
so right there you got for them coming
out one way leading to this guy - or the
two of them here two of them on the
inside track and then you've got two
coming out the other side that are
leading to the other ring of aluminum
fins so these are copper heat pipes
aluminum fins and the base is extremely
shiny so there's the obligatory finger
shot there where you can see it's
basically a mirror mirror surface so how
does this work what would make this
cooler more efficient in a smaller space
than other ones I'll tell you guys right
now what makes it more efficient the
fact that it has a central fan and it is
taking advantage of not only the air
that it is pushing on the back of the
fan but also the air that it is bringing
in from the front one of the things
that's going to make it quieter than
what you would typically see as well is
the fact that there's not a lot of
shrouding you're not forcing a lot of
the airflow at or around or through
things that are restrictive and noisy so
you generally get very quiet performance
with zalman coolers although not
necessarily like the most extreme
because let's face it if you have a
cooler that's three times the size of
this then it's no secret which one is
probably going to keep your CPU at lower
temperatures what I really want to do is
I want to check this one out in there
where is it the 11 + h f1 edition which
has red LEDs and so what we'll be doing
is once we're done with this guy we're
going to throw a motherboard and a power
supply in there and have a look at what
an all Zelman cooled and cased machine
is going to look like so thank you for
checking out this unboxing your first
look and don't forget to subscribe to -
tech tips from our boxing's reviews on
other computer videos and actually here
just get some close-ups of what it all
like looks like very shiny
Zellman is
I'm a master of sort of the detail of a
CPU cooler making sure it looks really
good look sharp performs well one of my
first aftermarket CPU coolers I ever
bought was a Zalman CN PS 7,000 Cu I got
the all copper version because I wanted
to be baller like that yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
