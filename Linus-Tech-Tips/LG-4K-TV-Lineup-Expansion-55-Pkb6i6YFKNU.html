our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys in 2013 LG will be expanding
their 4k TV lineup the one on my left is
an 84 inch TV that launched in october
but at sort of you know a price point
that if you have to ask then you know
you probably don't have room for it next
to your eight portions and all of that
so let's get into things that are more
realistic so here in front of me I have
a 55 inch and a 65 inch these are
basically the sizes where it's going to
start making sense to jump to 4k because
below that 1080p already has a high
enough pixel density that from the couch
you probably won't be able to tell that
much of a difference now they've updated
their 2013 platform with what they're
calling the Magic Remote which is kind
of like a wii modem that you can point
at it or in air mouse you can point and
flick it has a scroll wheel and you can
also use voice commands you could say
something like oh yeah you can motion in
the air just draw the number 15 go to
channel 15 and you can talk to it and
say you know uh show me romantic
comedies with Tom Hanks and you'll get a
list of every movie he ever made I'm
just kidding i saw Apollo 13 I know that
wasn't a romantic comedy other important
factors these are going to be available
later on in the year so be very excited
guys 4k is very much coming to prime
time thanks for watching Linus tech tips
at CES 2013 powered by Corsair seagate
technology and linksys
