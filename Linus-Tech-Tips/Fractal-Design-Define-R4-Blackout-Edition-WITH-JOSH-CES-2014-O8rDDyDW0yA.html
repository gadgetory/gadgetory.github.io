brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital so we're here in the
fractal design suite where josh is
conspicuously absent I'm pretty sure
he's drinking so we've got all right you
can come you can come in the video now
why don't you help us you're actually
the only one who is co-hosted a video
with me the entire show because of how
much taller people are than I am on the
first LAN show before you call it a LAN
show and it was like a garage show so I
got way back street cred speaking of the
garage look at what fractal made
apparently in their garage because all
they did was took the define r4 and take
the white things and make them black
tell us about the black out edition
define r4 okay so basically what the
black out edition is is basically it's a
combinational fan feedback right we are
the company that listens and we've
gotten a lot of requests having all
black interior to go for hold on fan
feedback our fan fiction I would say
feedback because I've seen it so anyway
what we did is we basically went back
and we offered a fully black interior we
wanted to answer what the fans wanted as
far as different features and we want to
show we do actually pay attention what
you guys say all right so what have you
guys actually changed here you've
changed the color of the PCI brackets
you've changed the color of the hard
drive brackets change the color of the
fans which actually it's kind of
impressive because they had to do a
custom fan skew fractal design only has
black and white fans in order to make
this a truly stealth looking product is
it available in a windowed version with
like a stealth window at this time it is
not actually the windows so stealth it
looks like a solid side panel but given
that you guys are listening to fan
feedback if people came to you and they
said hey look we love the blackout
edition but we want to see like a like a
tinted window on it or something would
you guys consider it oh definitely like
I said I mean if they want to hit us up
on Facebook or comment on your video let
us know you guys want to see that's how
we find out if you don't see something
from us that you want let us know we
take all that feedback so guys that's
the focus of this video is they're not
showing off too much because quite
frankly if it ain't broke don't fix it
the define r4 is the number one most
built in case in the build log section
of the Linus tech tips form and for a
very good reason
so all they could really come up with
well I guess we'll tweak the color a
little bit and we'll see how it goes
from there but if you guys have any
feedback for fractals cases please do
leave a comment on the video let them
know because josh will personally be
reading every commented because now that
I've said that his boss will make sure
that he does there goes my weekend I
appreciate that I might get to
Assassin's Creed 4 sometime next year
but you know we do listen and read and
do homework
thanks to Linus speaking of fractal
design fans there are no shortage of
boutique system builders that are using
fractal design cases these days because
again guys if the if the experienced
builders on the lightest tech tips form
used them then experienced boutique
builders also know that the defined
series is a pretty rockin series of
cases that this is the define our for
this is velocity micro you can see
they've got some nice little velocity
micro branding on the front other than
that they keep things very clean looking
next up we've got this isn't an arc
series actually this is an arc XL and
this is from exotic PC and they have
done this one out so it's got full green
liquid cooling it's got a full green
paint job and it is I mean I think you
can probably tell that it has a fully
green lighting scheme on it finally here
we have a defined XL so this is similar
in terms of internal layout to the arc
XL but it's got that those same clean
lines and it's very silence optimized so
I would like to take it I don't know why
this is off oh it's and sleep so I'd
like to take an opportunity to take my
microphone I just powered the system on
and show you guys how incredibly quiet
it is in spite of the fact that this is
a dual CPU system well yeah of course
you can hear it a little bit but the
point is I put a microphone inside a
dual CPU system and it's like not loud
at all and this is without the side
panel with it's noise dampening even
closed so thank you guys for checking
out our suite coverage get it cuz I
recovered is in the suite of the fractal
suite here at CES 2014 don't forget how
big thank you goes out from us and all
of you to our sponsors NCI XCOM your
source for great technology selection
and service course our memory and
Western Digital without those guys we
would not be able to be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
