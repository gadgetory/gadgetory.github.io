rig in fact this isn't even that big
this is just a standard case with seven
expansion slots an ATX board and you
know it accepts a couple of graphics
cards but this build guide with the
GeForce GTX Titan and I'm going to just
ground myself there before I touch it
the GeForce GTX Titan is going to focus
on a different sort of gaming rig the
Titan because of its incredible acoustic
performance that is to say low noise low
power consumption compared to something
like a GTX 690 and outstanding
performance enables a new class of small
form-factor gaming machines so we're
going to be using a 3770k which is about
as fast as it gets for a gaming CPU and
a Suzy 77 Ida luxe WiDi motherboard 16
gigs of Corsair Dominator platinum
memory and ocz vertex 4 SSD and a/c
Sonic 550 watt power supply and last but
not least a low profile CPU cooler from
thermal write this is the a XP 100 all
of this in a nineteen point two liter
cuba tech mini cube case now we could
have fitted in our FTO three mini with a
little bit of modification of one of the
brackets but we opted not to do that so
instead we're going to go with a case
that natively supports that once we're
done we're going to show you
I mean performance numbers later but
once we're done this we're going to show
you how it sounds compared to a 79 70
when it's installed in a small
form-factor chassis like this all right
so it's update time guys there was no
way those Dominator Platinum's were
going to fit in this rig unfortunately
because there's a slight overhang with
the memory slots from the CPU cooler
itself so we went with a low-profile
Kingston HyperX memory kit that just
barely touches the heatsink so it should
get some you know incidental cooling
from the downdraft CPU cooler I could
have installed a larger CPU cooler in
fact you can see if I put this down in
the case I haven't installed the
standoffs yet but if I put this down in
the case you can see that my CPU cooler
could have gone up to here but I like
using a downdraft CPU cooler in a build
like this and I like giving you
titin and cable management some some
rooms so I'm going to go this route and
see how it sort of turns out here
speaking of the Titan I'm going to go
ahead and put the GeForce GTX Titan
inside the case just to show you guys
what this is going to look like once
it's all be stood out here and we've
made some more changes so instead of the
sort of failed thin low-profile fan that
we were going to use I'm not going to
use that anymore we've done away with it
and gone with some Noctua
and ff12 fans instead so there's our
intake at the bottom front here nice
high pressure optimized fan so we're
going to be able to draw air under the
case around the feet and then up inside
that'll go straight to the Titan GPU
then I've added another one on the CPU
with an adapter that gives more
incidental airflow to the vrm as well as
the memory we've also added our power
supply so this is in an 80 plus gold see
Sonic 550 watt power supply with a
modular interface you can see I've run
my SATA cables so just for lols I've
changed the scope of the build again and
we are actually going to install all of
the I will not all but we're going to do
two two and a half two and a half inch
drives and two three and a half inch
drives just for the lawls to show you
guys what kind of an insane super gaming
computer you can fit inside this kind of
an enclosure alright here's the moment
you've all been waiting for guys
assuming you're still with us this far
into the video where we squeeze the ten
and a half inch tighten graphics card
into this extremely narrow narrow spot
where it hopefully will fit okay we're
putting a little bit of strain on those
front panel connectors but I think it's
okay and I think that we are in let me
just double check
there's no PCIe lock on this particular
card because it's a it's a reference
board but I think we're in there
so let's go ahead and screw it in
whoopsie daisies and let's go ahead and
screw it in if I was smart I would have
done the bottom screw first so that it
would hold it in place well it's okay
that one worked here we go all right
that is one dense system very dense not
not dense in a stupid way
I'm tired it's late made quite a few
videos today so there's not much to say
other than I'm really trying to try to
get this graphics card in here and thumb
screws are both a blessing and the bane
of my existence at times because
sometimes they're just more awkward to
put in actually and right now I'm having
one of those moments and you guys are
getting to enjoy it with me there we go
ah yes so we are tightened out now but
obviously the system won't boot because
tighten does require external power so
you can see here this intake fan is
going to bring fresh air directly to
that graphics card and then the CPU is
going to be able to hopefully sort of
somewhat fend for itself up there and
here I vzi Express connectors so these
ones I didn't realistically think I was
going to be able to run them from the
back which is fine anyway because the
the GPU itself is right here so I'm just
going to run those down here again if I
was smart and less tired I would have
run these before the important thing to
note about this build guys is that no
shortcuts have been taken no special
parts have been used you can build your
own extremely small form-factor gaming
machine for the well however much this
costs I don't even know at this point
it's not cheap but it'll be awesome and
that's the most important thing so we'll
be back once I figure out how to do this
so here we go guys this is the insanity
that is the back of this machine so I
ended up going with two
Samsung 840 pros so that would be 512
gigs of raid zero SSD storage then I
went with to Western Digital 3 terabyte
hard drives so in theory you could have
dual 512 gig SSDs and then 2 4 terabyte
hard drives back here now there was no
hope and using the actual mounting
points for the SSDs which is fine
because the SSDs have no moving parts so
I'm not really worried about them
randomly busting anyway now we've tried
pressing this flat and we're pretty sure
it's going to close but I guess you guys
are going to find out with us no no it's
ok I got it
whether it will actually close or not
this one yep looks like it so we haven't
added the tighten to the system yet but
that's coming next that's actually the
last step we also have not yet added the
PCI Express power cables needed to power
the Titan however I've made sure that
there is room to install it so this this
computer will have four cores 8 threads
up to 16 gigs of ram of the most
powerful single GPU graphics card it'll
be pretty much near-silent because we're
using all Noctua coolers and the titan
itself is extremely quiet check that out
that actually did close Wow look at that
see look at that just awesome so that is
what she looks like
from this side with the cable management
available in this cuba tech case which
is actually not bad so we'll be back in
a moment
once I've screwed in the power supply
which I just realized I forgot to do and
we're going to show you guys the moment
where we put the Titan inside so
basically that's it guys check it out
these cables are managed back here so
they're just kind of wrapped around this
nock to a fan here at the bottom the
Knox with fans are both plugged into the
motherboard so we can use motherboard
control to control that fan GPU boost to
will control the GPU temperatures the
fan rpm as well as the GPU clocks
and we are pretty much ready to boot
this bad boy up I mean I think the only
way we could actually stuff more
technology in here is if we didn't even
worry about connecting it to anything
and we just kind of you know there
there's a there's a pile of SSDs and
like there there's some more SSDs and
they're the phone and like some memory
like many more different phone there you
go that's the only way we could actually
make this more densely packed it's all
polling we'll be back our Titan machine
is done so we'd love for you guys to
join us for the moment of truth where we
actually try and boot this bad boy up so
let's go ahead and press the button hmm
okay give it a sec and there we go oh
that's beautiful
and let's try that one more time
did it go oh that looks so good
does that look as good in the camera
that does it all okay she's up she's
awake overclocking failed yeah don't
worry about it it's all good I don't
think we have any overclocking running
on this board so you got my like late
night building computer snacks okay give
me a sec here guys so we're going to get
into the OS and we'll be back in a
moment okay guys so I've actually
switched to this microphone so that we
can take some audio levels now we
haven't actually closed the system up
yet but we're running Far Cry 3 I can't
show you any benchmarks right now just
so you guys know but we're going to do a
couple of reference sounds for you guys
so you can get some idea of how a system
like this might run the first thing we
have to write oh yeah I need to be over
here the first thing we have to do is
actually put the side panel on just to
demonstrate that Titan can run in a
configuration like this so let's just
get some more let's get a couple more
glam shots of what the system looks like
inside I've got some LED lighting
courtesy of a bit phoenix alchemy strip
up there I mean if you were worried
about the sort of perfect aesthetics and
you might go with something other than
Noctua fans but I love the performance
of these fans and this rig is all about
performance so we've readjusted our
microphone because we couldn't actually
pick up the noise of the system when it
was at idle but we're under full load
now so running prime95 small at 50 on
the 3770k and running far cry 3 looking
at a fire ah to stress the Titan now I
can't tell you guys any exact numbers or
benchmarks yet as of the time of filming
this video but what I can tell you is
that GPU boost is still working very
well more than the promised GPU boost
clock significantly more and actually
that's a good idea
and just for reference we're going to
make some different noises here to show
you guys just how quiet this system is
so we're going to drop a coin onto a
wooden table
I'm going to call a galaxy s3 that's set
to vibe
right and then we're going to show you a
me and it's funny because old Nvidia
cards used to get compared to hair
dryers so let's do the old hair dryer
test so this is on low there's the
system again for reference we're really
impressed with the system here the say
here's their dryer on high
so temperatures I'll say this much
temperatures for the GPU are very
comfortable so it's still boosting
alright I need to be closer to Mike
temperatures for the GPU are very
comfortable is still boosting like I
said past the rated minimum sort of
boost clock that you should see and
temperatures for the CPU I can allowed
to talk about those are at about eighty
degrees so this system is very
functional very well within its
operating sort of specifications and
ambient temperatures though are a little
bit on the low side in this room slip
could you go ahead and press that green
button for me so I can just see what the
temperatures aren't here so it's about
eleven degrees in here so you'd probably
hit let's say in a normal room you'd hit
more like ninety degrees on the CPU
which is still you know this is during
an unrealistic load prime95 small FFT
plus a game running and then that GPU
probably wouldn't boost quite as high
but the system would work thank you for
