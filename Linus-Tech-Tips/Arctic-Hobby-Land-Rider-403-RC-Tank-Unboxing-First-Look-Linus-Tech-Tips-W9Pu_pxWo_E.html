403 from Arctic hobby which as you may
or may not have noticed has a very
similar logo to Arctic Cooling's Arctic
hobby has released Alondra are the land
rider 403 battle tank so let's see what
they have to say for themselves
leopard tank with authentic design
adjustable smoothbore gun and bullet
shooting function yes that's right
bullet shooting function and realistic
sounds so here you can see all the
different functionality goes forward
back right left it adjusts the gun up
and down and 202 no no wait right left
and up and down and it fires phenomenal
comes with four bullets a 9-volt battery
a battery pack on a charging cable for
Arctic hobby charging station a radio
control and the tank itself so based on
the fire engine which I have good
thinking's like based on the fire engine
which we've already had a quick look at
but I probably won't have released the
video yet by the time we see the battle
tank video probably comes with pretty
much everything you need to get started
with your land rider 403 pounds this
thing is so cool
look at this okay does it get any more
badass than that I would I would suggest
that it does not ok let's go ahead and
start opening this guy up
okay undo these seals here I'm gonna
have to yeah there we go there we are so
that's how the packaging comes apart at
any rate so what all we got here here's
our battery pack which is secured and
with packing tape okay yeah so that
looks like six double-a cells that are
all wired together and whatnot you could
probably make your own if you wanted but
you know I wouldn't recommend it unless
you don't need me to tell you that you
could probably make your own so okay
let's go ahead and open up that so we're
going to need this nine-fold battery for
me yes
color matching remote control in
authentic army green this okay so
there's that and then we have the tank
itself which I'm going to have to figure
out how to extract so the first thing we
find here is an antenna which I'm just
going to go ahead and is going to put in
there so that it stays up nice and high
then we've got this guy whatever this is
okay so let's we'll have to figure out
what that is
and then we bought bullets via yeah
bullets and then um some kind of
mechanism that might be for loading the
bullets that would be that would be my
suspicion okay all right what else we
got here this rotates you know what
let's have a look at the accessories
here I mean how cool of a dad or an
uncle or a cousin or whoever you are we
are I guess mom mom's might buy tanks
for their for their kids but mine never
did how cool would you be if you showed
up with one of these on Christmas
morning so it comes a little tank
sticker and it comes with instructions
so here okay this just shows us how to
you know press your thumb on the thing
and do the thing how to shoot what else
we got here so how to install all the
batteries how to charge your batteries
actually you can get a normal charger
which is just Walmart and you can charge
the battery pack stop
you can see we already had one going so
that we're going to be able to demo this
right away how to load the bullets so
you put them in this way and then you
use the plunger to push them down and
how to turn on the remote so I guess
it's just a matter of getting it
extracted from the packaging now which I
might need a minute to do so bear with
me here guys so the battery pack gets
installed on the bottom we've got that
installed you hit the on switch and then
you're pretty much ready to roll so to
speak okay so why don't we have a close
look at the tank itself and then slick
is actually going to be the first one to
operate this tank before even I get an
opportunity I I told them I told me he
was allowed to do that I'll check this
out look at this look at this like
authentic spring action so you could
actually in theory roll over something
very cool okay so the driving ones are
actually these ones back here everything
else is just just freewheel in it okay
so these guys are the drivetrain this
one back here what else we got on the
bottom that's kind of interesting I
think that's about it I need some note
to me that this is actually made of
rubber so you're going to have some real
traction with your battle tank here
alright let's have a look at the
detailing on both sides so you got
everything down to like shovels attached
here and like I don't know what it is
smoke grenades I I don't know anything
about tanks so I'm just going to get
select a kind of Han here these um like
open up for some reason maybe that's
like a dude goes here and then fires
over to something like I don't know but
there you go so those open up actually
that one opens up on the other side as
well okay and then we got like some
handles and whatnot at the front we got
like some gear and equipment and stuff
check this out check out the barrel
extension I'm guessing when it fires it
actually like recoils although I mean if
it doesn't I'll forgive it cuz that's
pretty elaborate but this gun rotates
right here this gun on the top rotates
around this looks like some kind of
camera or like oh that might actually do
something because it's got a light
inside it so uh um what okay the whole
thing goes like this I think is what
slicks saying okay don't worry
but it's like I'll show you when he's
operating it and it'll make me feel dumb
for not noticing it before okay so
there's that more equipment on the sides
here this thing just generally looks
pretty freakin sweet here on the back we
see the speakers where the sound effects
are going to come out of and then we've
also got a license plate because if
you're driving your tank without
insurance then you are just asking for
trouble okay
we found figured out what this is for
it's not just a tank picture it is a
target so we're going to go ahead we're
going to put the tank target right there
which hopefully will actually stand up
for this here if you have to kind of
bend it a little bit I guess that's
understandable on account of they didn't
really charge you anything for it there
we go let's kind of change the balance
of that there we go okay so the tank
target is up the tank is powered on and
I'm just going to load her up here and
then I'm going to leave it to slick to
show you guys how the tank fires its gun
so let's just put that in there a lot of
these covered in anything oh yeah these
are rubber tipped so they shouldn't
really do any damage if they if they hit
something although I can't imagine it
fires that that far yeah it doesn't go
in very far so yeah I'm sure I'm sure
it's okay does it oh hold on
oh it's spring-loaded okay so okay over
just over to slick as you guys can see
slick is very tall well you can't really
see cuz he's like hunched over and
hiding under his hood but whatever all
right slick fire the cannon that was so
cool that was so cool well that actually
had like some some force to it there
that's amazing whoa okay okay hold on we
better put this on the floor hold on
hold on hold on I got it I got it okay
here we go here we go right about now
I'm thinking this is okay let's let's
charge around the tech tips room here
let's go go where could it go
Oh way to get the thing stuck this must
be oh hold on hold on okay okay he's
showing all the functionality I just
wanted him to drive around but I guess
we should show the functionality okay
okay so they're gonna just up and down
show me that again
okay cool cool rotate the turret there
we go
that's pretty cool okay show me some
sound-effects look at that the whole
tank recoils that's ridiculous
okay okay drive drive it around driver
please don't drive over that again
though care take take it out they're
like driving here
let's go can you go over the extension
cord apparently you can okay
