we previewed for real AMD thread ripper
performance thanks to Alienware but come
on - that was just a preview you only
did one benchmark you're such a tease I
know but that was then and this is now
Alienware has arranged for their system
to be exclusively reviewed before the
formal embargo lifts for Rison thread
ripper so let's uh rip it open
tano bear four teams makes it easy to
secure your Wi-Fi on any network and
comes with priority support and easy
team management try it for free at the
link below now we usually focus on
pre-built desktop PCs where there's
something truly standout about them
otherwise we'd be reviewing every Best
Buy special that hit the shelves back in
2014 the cool thing about the all-new
area 51 was the rotated motherboard tray
and the Triad design with RGB lighting
and design wise not much has changed if
you liked it then you'll like it now and
vice versa
what stands out now though is the
internals so let's pop the panel and
show you around the irony of a DVD
burner on something that's trying to
look like alien technology isn't lost on
me but the rest of the i/o is what I
would describe as suitably futuristic
we've got dual USB 300 and a card reader
at the front with lots more USB 3 at the
back including a type C port opening up
the other side reveals that these aliens
are the type to cram everything under
the bed when their alien mom asks them
to clean their room and we also find a
trio of three-and-a-half inch hard drive
mounts and a companion dual
two-and-a-half inch mount for SATA SSDs
perfectly adequate for future upgrades
what's not perfect about the case is its
unwieldly Ness the chassis itself makes
generous use of steel which makes it
strong sure but also super heavy
considering that there's only a single
hard drive and a single 120 millimeter a
IO cooler in there and there aren't any
obvious handholds making it quite
difficult to get a grip on it a
combination that totally has no
relevance whatsoever two instances in
the past where in things may or may not
have escaped my grip through no fault of
my own
who all of these systems come configured
with AMD Rison thread Ripper in the 1950
X variant we're talking 16 cores and 32
threads on this CPU that also happens
have 40 megabytes of cash seriously it
has more cash than the 286 era hard
drive that a fan brought to LTX for me
to sign
it also features 64 PCI Express lanes
allowing it to run up to three graphics
cards at full PCI Express 16x Gen 3
speeds for 3-way crossfire or for
workstation use with plenty of PCIe
lanes to spare for the onboard Wi-Fi
SATA controller for hard drive and an
MDOT 2 slot that houses a 256 gig
SanDisk a 400 nvme SSD so now then let's
meet the challengers rx 299 test bench
with its core I 970 900 X skylake X CPU
is the most obvious analog from the blue
team given its similar price but we'll
be including results from our mainstream
platforms as well kicking things off
then our our gaming tests which should
surprise no one this is an alienware
after all with rise of the Tomb Raider
we're looking at pretty similar but
slightly worse performance overall while
our synthetics put it pretty much on par
with the core i9 we are planning to run
more thread refer gaming benchmarks but
those will have to wait for the full
review moving on to productivity we see
pretty much what we expected to see
major wins in multi-threaded workloads
the biggest victories though come in
blender it's time to render beats out
the core i9 test bench by 37 seconds in
the BMW test and by over 2 minutes in
the classroom sample day am I don't pull
that off very well do i anyway we do
have to note though that we found that
our Centauri axe cooler really struggled
red ripper fully chilled and running its
best and after swapping in our own with
a fresh application of thermal compound
so then who is the area 51 thread Ripper
Edition 4 at 4,000 US Dollars aspect to
be brutally honest we're not quite sure
I mean there are actually a lot of
exceptions to the conventional wisdom
that it would be cheaper to build your
own gaming PC like Dells own also AMD
based inspiring gaming desktop that
we'll be reviewing soon but the area 51
costs like a boutique system with some
significant drawbacks an unexceptional
motherboard with only four dimm slots
rather than eight and limited
overclocking options unsightly exposed
PCBs on the RAM and exposed bare steel
on the to alien where's credit beefy and
modular 1500 watt power supplies along
with and this is by far the worst one
frankly inadequate cooling the area 51
runs almost as hot and loud as a laptop
under synthetic load and at this size
and weight there's no excuse for that
bottom line men if you really want the
area 51 as a status symbol alien where
is the first place you can get your
hands on a prebuilt thread Ripper system
but understand that the early adopter
tax you'll be paying is in more than
money
I am fully expecting boutique systems
built around this platform for this
price with better cooling and cable
management in the coming months so
