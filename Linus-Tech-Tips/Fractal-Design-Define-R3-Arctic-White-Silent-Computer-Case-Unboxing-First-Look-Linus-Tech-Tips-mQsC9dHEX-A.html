back but the define R 3 actually came up
to replace it quite a while ago so I had
not had a chance to unbox the define R 3
but now I do this is actually a special
define R 3 so the define R 3 is
available in all of the same colors as
the old R 2 that is black and then black
with the titanium front and black with a
silver front but this one is an all
Arctic white version so it is more
expensive because the paint finish on it
is higher-end and it does cost more to
produce but let's have a look at what
the R 3 bring us to the table over the R
2 so first of all let's have a look at
what fractal design has to say for
themselves on the front stylish ATX case
but focus on combining top-notch design
them style and funny they don't say
anything about silence but it is brand
with high ambitions to deliver products
with an exclusive design good quality
and interesting functions all at a
modest price tag ok we have an opening
in the motherboard tray for easy
mounting of CPU coolers
we have removable dust filters and
anti-vibration pads below the PSU
position all eight of the tuna house /
three and a half inch drive expansion
base our SSD compatible so you could
theoretically load this thing up with 8
SSDs if you had the budget for it
alright and then here on the other side
you guys can sort of read about some of
those features while I open up TV
packaging to show you this case look
though the features are pretty similar
to the define R cube first thing we find
inside the box is actually a user's
manual oh there's stuff in there about
how to remove your side panel I suppose
look at that so they show you the case
label all the parts ok flip this over
and it looks like the packaging has
actually been reinforced since the
define are two so instead of using just
an outer cardboard shell with foam
packaging there's actually another
cardboard layer as well as overall
thicker foam around the case packing it
in so here I'll let you guys have a look
at that so that gives it a little bit
more structure to the package itself
meaning that once it shifts from fractal
to the reseller to you the chances are
very good it will still be in mint
condition
that's what packaging is all about on
cases cases especially it's very
important because they're heavy and big
boxes you know tend to get thrown around
by the Careers and so it's very
important to have a good outer box
especially if you have a system inside
because that adds a lot more weight to
it
and can put a lot more strain on the
packaging
all right so there is the define r3
arctic white they've done a very good
job of matching the white color between
the plastic components and the metal
components so yes this is a colored
plastic this is painted metal but it's
very very difficult to see the seam
between them first thing let's do this
let's have a look and do some external
impressions so on the front we see our
define sort of look this is what the
define r2 looked like it's what the
define our three looks like one thing
that's improved over the define r2 is
these little five and a quarter inch
bays so now they're a little bit easier
to remove and snap back into place a
little locking mechanism okay we have
the same doors in the front where we
have removable fan filters and mounts
for up to to 120 millimeter fans and the
same noise dampening foam in the front
door this is a reset switch which was
added over the define r2 this reset
switch was not present on our two
version of the case up at the top we
find the same overall inputs and out
so we have headphones microphone power
switch with a power led around it and
then a harddrive led oh no this is the
power LED there's no harddrive led my
bad and then there's two USB 2 and one
eSATA port up here we have some mod you
vent small G vents are cool I'll talk a
little bit more about them in a bit but
these two fan mounts can take either 120
millimeter or 140 millimeter fans up to
you so let's take off the side panel
actually here we'll have a look at the
back first so you can see the white
finish it also extends to the back so we
have some black accents so this is
pretty much the opposite of the black
versions of the case where we have a
black case with white PCI slot covers
now this is a white case with black PCI
slot covers and black accents oops if I
can get the side panel off a good thing
there we go alright so oh here on the
inside you can see right here this is
fractal design smelly's dampening
material so it's present on both the
side panel as well as a mod you vent
here so let's talk about actually here
I'm gonna bring this down and let's talk
about mod you vent so mod you vent means
that if you decide not to mount a fan
here you have noise dampening material
if you wanna screw these screws we're
actually in the side panel I should have
mentioned this you can do either a 120
or 140 millimeter fan if you unscrew the
mod you've any can put a fan in there so
you can decide whether you want maximum
Sylas or maximum cooling okay screws in
my bucket here so yeah inside we find
black accents where the define are where
the black versions have white accents so
here are the drive sleds
now black capable compatible with three
and a half inch or two and a half inch
drives let's look at the overall
interior so here are the mods events
that you were able to see from the
outside so you can remove those foam
pads and put in fans should you so
desire at the back we have a couple
water cooling grommets in the top whoops
I pulled that one house oh my bad
a couple water cooling grommets in the
top two in the back so if you want to
mount an external radiator you will be
able to run your tubing through there
looks to be compatible with 3/8 inch
tubing max though don't think you'll get
1/2
tubing through there we have a 120
millimeter fan in the back seven PCI
expansion slots we have a power supply
mount that has rubber on the bottom it
has a foam spacer piece between the back
of the case and the power supply so that
means that as long as your power supply
has a reasonably silent fan you
shouldn't be passing any vibrations
along to the chassis we can mount
another fan here in the bottom okay with
these clips and that is a filtered fat
intake there's also a filter which is
removable under the power supply intake
fan if you have a 120mm fan you can
intake from the bottom without any risk
here's another thing that's been
improved from the r2 these silicone
cable management grommets are using a
much higher quality rubber so on the r2
they were a little bit stiff and they
didn't return to their original form
quite as easily so these ones are
phenomenal and one of the great things
about the define chassis is that you can
use these cable management holes because
there is adequate space between the side
panel and the motherboard tray to run
any cables you want back there here is
the CPU cut out so you can replace your
heatsink without actually taking the
motherboard out of the case and then
moving along to the front we have our
five and a quarter inch base one of
which actually comes pre-installed with
a five and a quarter to three and a half
inch adapter so if you only use one five
and a quarter inch device like most
people out there you can even mount nine
drives in this case in the standard
configuration and then of course there's
our mounting accessories as well as a
PCI slot mounted fan controller so
that's there and then you've got your
eight three and a half inch / two and a
half inch drive mounts here we have our
bundle of black so it's nice to see this
that's what gives you a good aesthetic
in these fractal cases black cables so
these are for the front switches front
light front USB and the front eSATA so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
