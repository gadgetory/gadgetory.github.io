DataTraveler Ultimate 3.0 so the data
traveller line of products from Kingston
is they are USB 3 or their USB storage
thumb drives ok so this is an ultimate
view point oh so the 3.0 means is that
it is USB 3 so that means you are going
to get faster speeds out of it then you
will out of a USB 2 thumb drive so this
particular guy is more value oriented
USB 3 Drive it's not quite the fastest
one out there but it's still going to be
several times faster than anything on a
USB 2.0 interface it has that thumb
shell type package that I am really not
a big fan of and I forgot my knife
upstairs so I'm trying to struggle my
way through this but give me a second
here guys so I forced it open with a
screwdriver of all things there we go
all right so what's Kingston have to say
for themselves about this guy well
they're saying up to 100 megabytes per
second reads up to 70 megabytes per
second writes now my experience with
these USB 3 drum drives is that you're
only really gonna achieve those speeds
in a scenario where you're reading or
writing large files so if you're doing
small files that will be smaller but are
smaller slower but they will still be
dramatically faster than the USB 2
equivalents so here we go
speed read okay and it will max out a
USB 2.0 interface at about 30 and 30
megabytes per second reads and writes
now that 30 is probably a little bit
optimistic I would think would be more
along the lines of about 25 in terms of
real-world testing with you know not one
large sequential 16 gig file this is the
16 gig version but it is available in a
variety of capacities and it comes with
a little keychain to capture piece so
you can use that to well attach it to
your keychain through the loop hole at
the top although I would suggest using
something a little bit more sturdy these
USB 3 drives still aren't cheap so
you're gonna want to make sure that you
don't accidentally lose it so we'll have
a quick look at the drive itself which
is actually very stylish ok so you've
got a nice cap here which has a brushed
metal
on the sides of both sides of it and
then just white plastic here you've got
the USB 3 interface which has as you can
see the 4 standard USB pins as well as
the 5 extra USB 3 ones at the back then
you've got more brushed metal finish on
the sides here at Kingston logo and then
as I mentioned before you've got that
hook on the top of it so you could put
like a keychain loop or whatever else
you desire on it there now the top only
fits on one way so you won't
accidentally put it on the wrong way and
it actually sticks fairly well so there
shouldn't be too much risk of losing
that there you go that's the data travel
traveler ultimate g2 16 gig USB 3
external I guess it would have to be
external USB thumb drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
