contribution to like incredible
experiences that we've created have been
playing racing games on the 16 K and 10
K ultra wide gaming setups and frankly
they were Smash Hits good job Jake but
this year for our racing experience
we're not content to settle for bezels
or even virtual cars this is next level
my friends what if instead of a video
game car on a screen we could drive
actual cars in VR I mean yeah okay there
there RC cars but like come on close
enough right SiC right
just like our sponsor Ridge wallet Oh
Ridge wallet is the sleek way to keep
wallet bulbs down with its compact frame
and it offers RFID blocking inner plates
use code LTTE to save 10% and get free
worldwide shipping at the link below
let's break this down so first we've got
to figure out how to control our
steering servo here with a steering
wheel as well as figuring out how to
control our ESC or electronic speed
controller with a throttle and a brake
pedal and then there's the video stuff
like how do we even mount it what are we
gonna use like there's a lot of
questions here yeah
furthermore getting that video feed to
the headset is another issue so we need
something that's high quality enough
that you can really see where you're
going through it and also low latency
enough but you don't just want to
immediately throw up we're probably
getting ahead of ourselves a little bit
though because before we can do any of
that stuff we need to settle on a
platform or a car there's a lot of
options out there obviously but we need
something that's not crazy expensive
because you know you're kind of cheap we
need something that's gonna be reliable
with good battery life because this is
gonna be seven plus hours for two days
and it needs to be not too big or too
fast because both of those things are
gonna contribute to motion second yeah
if you're like ripping around that fast
like four inches from the ground we want
to keep our vomit quota for lcx pretty
low could it be done now of course it
also still needs to be big enough to
house all the first person view hardware
and I mean ideally be fun to play with
when we're just done this project right
yeah there we go so turns out there was
a bit of a miscommunication Jake and I
define large a little bit differently so
for better for worse we ended up with a
Traxxas Slash
two-wheel drive which would be perfect
for this project if it was oh I don't
know about 30% smaller and okay okay
okay maybe about a fifth of the speed
it's fun though yeah that's fine roll
with this all right all right all right
well one thing I didn't show you is it
has training mode which cuts the
throttle in half you know Jake's not so
bana we're on the same wavelength here
all right it's still pretty quick okay
still probably a little faster than we
wanted sorry David
getting our steering working with the
USB steering wheel was the first real
challenge now we knew thanks to fellow
youtuber RC sparks that there was a
steering wheel that would work really
well for this setup thanks to its simple
design the thrust master Ferrari racing
wheel and thankfully Thrustmaster was
able to supply us with several of them
to tinker with and it looks like with
some minor modifications we should be in
pretty good shape
so with the RC transmitter and the
steering wheel opened up this actually
looks relatively straightforward ish
hopefully knock on wood so the
transmitter just has a potentiometer so
you can see the one behind the steering
wheel right here and then it's got a
second one for the throttle so that's
pretty cool so if the resistance is the
same between this and there we go the
potentiometer here and while the other
one would be in the pedals we'll deal
with that later we should be able to
just move the wires over and yeah
they're different so we're dealing with
ten kilo ohm potentiometers in the
steering wheel and then just five kilo
yeah sorry yeah five kilo for the
transmitter okay so hopefully then what
we can do is find some five kilo ohm
pots that are a similar size to what's
already in the steering wheel because
we'd rather not have to make adapters or
something just to mount the pot so we
can turn the stem on it when we turn the
wheel after a quick trip to the local
electronics store
Jake returned with something reminiscent
of what we previously had although we
could tell some minor modifications were
going to be necessary for the pedals we
weren't able to locally source flat
sided potentiometers in the resistance
that we needed so while you could
probably just drill out the hole in
these little gears we decided to instead
3d prints and replacements as for the
steering wheel the
geometers was really close to fitting
but some cutting and sanding was
required to get it nice and snug in
there we went with a super professional
hot glue mount for now but by the time
we roll this out at LTX it'll probably
be upgraded to jb weld for wiring we
followed along as closely as we could
with our see sparks as guide and it
turned out pretty well although we did
have to swap our petals from left to
right as they were reversed okay so
theoretically if you fire that up turn
three mil oh no way
okay that's the easy one okay sigh you
saw it definitely trying we should try
the calibration thing whoa whoa wake it
so what we're trying to do right now is
calibrate the petals because
theoretically you can set up what I
guess it would be the receiver yeah the
speed control you're ready yeah okay
ready does already press it no no sorry
well it's moving at least so we got the
throw is it enough to get it to go oh
not very fast this might be better
though it's a little slow I feel like we
have less throw than we did in the
controller trigger so the ones in the
control are 180 degrees right see how
yeah blah blah blah and then these ones
are like 270 yeah so what if we cut this
just cut the stoppers out so while Jake
chops up the pedal assembly it's time to
talk about the first person view video
setup now we browsed a ton of different
tutorials and forums for information
about what the best individual
components were for a setup like that
and the conclusion is that it's kind of
like building a PC except rather than
what CPU GPU and ram you should buy it's
which video transmitter receiver camera
antennas headset and batteries and
there's a lot less community consensus
on the benefits of certain parts over
others so at this point it felt like
throwing the company credit card at an
RC shop and validating a bunch of
different stuff ourselves might have
been our only choice that is until we
found out that DJI makes a pretty much
plug and play first-person view camera
called oq sync which when paired with
their racing goggles supposedly provides
a super low latency and high quality
video feed you know I gotta say as much
as I was genuinely looking forward to
cobbling something together and
tinkering with it
given that we're gonna be running this
at a live event with thousands of
attendees I'm actually pretty happy that
we found a premade solution one point
DJI failed to mention to us however is
that see this right here is the receiver
and camera module it actually needs
active cooling otherwise it can overheat
I mean I guess that makes sense given
that this thing is designed to be used
on open air like racing drones but
anyway it's fine because we can just
simulate that airflow with a little 5
volt knock to a fan a 3d printed bracket
and then some of these old Enzo tech
heat sinks okay so now that Jake is
pretty much done with the hack job
behind me I guess it's time for me to
try and find some look it's not I know
it's not gonna be perfect today think
about what we're gonna have to do is cut
some holes in this top but so we don't
maintain it for LTX we're just gonna
temporarily mount it yes because LTX we
want it to be very pretty and pretty is
not our specialty and like think about
it it's not like when you sit in your
car you don't have your dash in front of
the windshield like we'll be able to see
well enough it's not it's gonna be like
right in front Lee look I know look if I
could put it up supercar something sure
Oh hot glue I'm just putting
little bit okay well it has a bracket
you know well now it's hot glue
hopefully right side up - you can flip
it alright there we go that's doesn't
quick that's on there no please don't
hot glue that what's just a little Oh No
just a DAB okay I forgive you for
choosing this car that's expensive
because it's not actually working pretty
darn well yeah yeah easy for you to say
did you pay for it no but neither did
you
yes I did well - Media Group
Incorporated good okay so now the
battery we need the battery yep I'm not
gonna hot glue you at home this is a
lithium polymer battery I would strongly
recommend not hot gluing one of these
anywhere you got to rip it off just
tears the cell in half that's a massive
fire yeah yeah spicy hey nice alright so
the cooling fans going
is it super wide angle yeah actually
holy crap I can see David right now
really from where you are
720p right now so this is the I think
the highest quality setting it looks
pretty good like the lowest latency
setting you mean er no it's the highest
quality well really so the highest
latency okay how's your nausea I mean
the fact that you're moving isn't
helping but do you want to put it on the
ground I want to try it alright to try
this spoils with my labour where are the
pedals this is gonna be kind of
interesting watching me fall over okay I
feel like I'm driving a Jeep like it oh
man no way woah oh my gosh dude the
latency is so low no so we think it's
possible that we can insert an SD card
right here in the occupied and record
straight to this so you guys will see
the full quality haha isn't it sick hey
Jake what's up dude this is so awesome
so cool the graphics the graphics man
it's IRL man I could get like way better
at this with some practice alright
alright alright we can wrap this video I
can go I can go do mine sure ok so
there's definitely still some progress
for us to make before we can deploy this
at LTX but like wow this is genuinely
really awesome I know that this one was
a little bit sparse on the details but
the truth is that this was just proof of
concept we've still got some things to
iron out so the next video is going to
be the detailed guide for how you guys
could do this with similar gear at home
trying out the track and then of course
we're gonna be teasing the full
experience that you'll be able to have
at LTX 2019
speaking of experiences my sponsor
segways are an experience and a half are
they not with private internet access
you can hide your true IP address and
you can bypass your restrictions and
censorship because it makes you appear
as though you are somewhere else you can
use it on up to five devices at once
with a single account and it's got all
kinds of great features including their
internet kill switch if your VPN gets
disconnected involuntarily their DNS
leak protection
mase their own built-in malware blocker
and all the different tunable --zz that
you can adjust like their various levels
of encryption it's available for Windows
Mac Android iOS and as a Chrome
extension and you can check it out at LM
GGG / p IA linus - we're gonna have that

that button but if it was awesome get
subscribed hit the like button or check
out the link to where to buy the stuff
we featured in the video description
maybe don't buy the stuff we featured in
this video just yet because we still
have a lot to learn but next time next
time we'll be ready also linked in the
