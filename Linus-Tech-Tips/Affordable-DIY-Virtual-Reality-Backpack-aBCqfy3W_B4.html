computers like creating a sculpture the
construction is slow and meticulous time
is taken ensuring that every individual
cable is routed and managed perfectly
investments are made not only in their
cutting-edge hardware but also in things
that offer little to no performance
improvement like beautiful brushed
aluminum and tempered glass from their
superior components to their fine
craftsmanship to their seemingly
cult-like community it's easy to
understand the passion and like
sculptures the best personal computers
are all about the builders attention to
detail it has a gtx 980 like a desktop
pc it has rubber tubing like the
International Space Station
it has strapping like a pickup truck it
has a magnesium aluminum alloy frame
like an f1 car it mounts to your back
like a jet pack it features an AC to DC
voltage converted power delivery system
like the Cray supercomputer and it
features dual exhaust ports like an f-16
fighter jet the ltte Edition VR backpack
may just be the most revolutionary
closest to falling apart piece of
technology ever pulled out of a
Craigslist ad
you
the be quiet dark Bass Pro 900 modular
design supports a variety of different
layouts and configurations click on the
link in the video description to learn
more alright so first off I need to give
a shout out to the drive youtube channel
and Corbin Goodwin for their awesome
video the 0 given rx-7 which inspired
the intro to this video
Corbin's car is badass go check it out
now
getting back on topic why did we make a
VR backpack it's actually rather simple
we wanted to play with it and you can't
buy commercial one yet the b1 VR
backpack that we checked out from a Oris
in January at CES this year is vaporware
and the same is true for the zotac vr
backpack that was showcased at Computex
this year and while msi has announced
their vr 1 backpack and i've heard
through the grapevine that a certain
spacefaring organization that rhymes
with basa anyway so they're going to use
it for immersive training of their
astronauts which is very cool and that
also is not available yet so if you want
to solve the problem with the long cable
that runs between the headset and the
computer also known as the tether coming
up with something yourself is the only
way Linus had one idea but while he
lightened the cable itself
he ended up wearing a backpack full of
electronics so large and heavy that many
of you wondered if he wouldn't be better
off just you know putting the computing
device on his back directly this doesn't
remove the tether but it will remove any
issues with the tether as you just need
to cable manage it from well your back
so I set out to do this as
cost-effectively as possible without
compromising on the experience I started
with a proper hiking style backpack
frame with a waist buckle the weight
mitigation is really not a big deal
this thing with all this hardware weighs
less than the bag I used to carry around
school with just textbooks in it but as
with many things the most important
reason is cost I got this backpack for
25 bucks off Craigslist from a lady who
see
like she would have rather had anyone
come pick it up other than me after
removing the bag off of the frame I had
a perfect solid lightweight frame I got
the straps for another 20 bucks from
Home Depot and some spare waste rubber
tubing from Teheran for free 45 bucks
all in and with some more time spent
deal shopping and thinking of your own
creative ways to mount your laptop it is
possible that you could get even lower
overall none of this was that hard
I spent a bunch of time planning out the
best possible way to mount everything
looking up thermal properties of
different materials online and whatnot
then I finally went to Home Depot to
grab some gear to get it done and
thought hey what about straps like like
pickup trucks and that solution works
perfectly well and was far easier than
what I was actually thinking of doing so
just head out to the local store
junkyard get inspired and get her done
it's not that big of a deal now the
reason I chose to do this with a laptop
instead of various desktop components
wasn't actually the difference in
difficulty it would have still been
doable but I just didn't feel like it
was actually a compromise the percentage
of people buying gaming capable laptops
is increasing at a surprising rate in no
small part due to their performance even
this last generation Acer predator X 17
has a high performance Intel Core i7 68
20 HK a desktop grade 980 dual 256
gigabyte SSDs in raid 0 32 gigs of DDR 4
memory and more including an air vent
layout that worked perfectly for this
setup not to mention that for somebody
that already has one of these laptops 45
bucks isn't too much to invest in order
to be able to swap quickly between a VR
backpack experience and the normal
laptop experience that you're used to
now I know this video isn't going to get
a million views and I also understand
that it probably doesn't deserve it the
Internet currently is fueled by hype
drama and memes and this video contains
none of those sometimes I just feel
obligated to make a video where I show
that it really isn't that hard to just
create something of your own I'm
actually rather proud of this rickety
little bag it's mine
I was the one that made sure it matched
the standard Linus tech tips orange and
black colors I was the one that scared
the nice lady while picking up the
magnesium aluminum alloy frame and I was
the one that thought to use the
strapping I like to think of this
project as a reflection of me it's not
perfect but I'd like to think that it's
very functional and I'd like you to go
out and create something that is a
reflection of you send a picture or
video of it to me at Linus tech and tag
me if you want to reply at Luke
underscore la Fr and by this I do not
mean just a collection of computer parts
that you happen to plug into each other
I'm sure most of you watching are
sufficient enough at electrical Lego to
get that done
now go make something cool and make it
for you just let me know about it thanks
for watching guys if this video sucks
you know what to do you can dislike it
but LTT back pac-man will be very sad if
you do that because I don't I don't know
where I'm going with this like doing if
you liked it subscribe if you liked it
as well if you want to buy something a
laptop there we go check out the amazon
link in the video description down below
also discuss how terrible my creation
was on the forum the LCD community forum
their great over there and in the
description down below you can buy a
t-shirt not this one
well like ones that are like this one I
just don't think this one's available
anymore but you know that's cool
whatever if you want to see another
video check out this one where I turn an
old computer case into a test bench also
pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
