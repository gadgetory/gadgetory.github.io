familiarize myself with the current crop
of budget smartphones for a while
so when Alcatel reached out offering to
send over a unit of their 3v a phone so
basic that it boasts us warranty as one
of its noteworthy features
I couldn't resist especially when I
noticed that this thing also has a 2160
by 1080 18 by 9 aspect ratio display and
costs only a hundred and fifty bucks
memory express is hosting a massive 22nd
anniversary sale from July 20th to July
22nd 2018 and they're gonna have tons of
deals check it out at the link below and
stay tuned to later in this video to
hear more let's start with some of the
things that cheesed me off about the 3v
before I'd even managed to get any apps
installed on it
number one the glass now I wasn't
expecting Corning Glass or anything but
over the entire phone both front and
back it is a lot more effort than I'm
accustomed to to drag my finger across
the glass now on the back it's not
actually a big deal in fact I think
other manufacturers here's a shammy mix
2s could learn a thing or two about
making their super shiny phones a little
bit less slippery to hold on to but on
the front the sticky feeling glass has
got to be the single cheapest feeling
thing about this phone and as an added
bonus it's actually harder to clean
smears off of it too so you'll spend
more time kind of scrubbing away at it
with your shirt compared to a Gorilla
Glass phone with a better coating number
two the haptic motor on this thing is
one of the worse that I've felt in a
long time even ignoring the taptic
engine apples fantastic haptic motor
that handles 3d touch it is like can you
guys hear that oh it's like going back
in time to when phones could vibrate
themselves off of a table when they were
ringing and if I type too fast with the
haptic feedback enabled it actually
sounds like the phones are gonna fall
apart and number three it has a USB
micro-b port I mean to be clear that is
not necessarily a huge functional
disadvantage many modern phones have
type-c ports but they still connect at
USB 2 speeds
anyway and they leave out a lot of the
really handy functionality that is
possible with a type C port like
out putting a display poor signal it's
just more fragile which is an issue
that's made worse by the three V's lack
of any you know fancy-pants modern
features like wireless charging all
right after all that though my
impression started getting a lot better
the 3v is lightweight which for some
people might contribute to the cheap
feel but I didn't really mind it and the
buttons things up okay you can't really
hear but they feel pretty clicky without
being too hard to press also I noticed
that they included SwiftKey keyboard
which I love and not much else you'll
find icons for Netflix and Facebook out
of the box but considering that I and
probably most people would have
downloaded those anyway I don't really
consider that to be bloat even the
performance deficiencies aren't really
visible in the traditional places like
it used to be that you could tell a
quality unit from a basic one just by
swiping left or right as it were and
everything from navigating between the
desktops to opening up folders actually
happens pretty smoothly even the app
launch times mind you we're talking
about web browsers and utilities here
not necessarily games weren't noticeably
bad but the media tech 87 35 a quad-core
processor which has four cortex a53
course at his heart really shows it's uh
well it shows it's something I wanted to
say age but was this thing even fast
when it was current anyway in certain
tasks like auto rotating on even a
mostly text web page or and this one's
actually much more egregious zooming in
on a picture that you've taken to admire
your handiwork
oh look at that
this thing feels noticeably seven or
eight years ago on that note though
admiring your handiwork the screen is
far from terror
it's six inches 2160 by 1080 yes the
fancy new 18 by 9 aspect ratio and the
Alcatel website even has a prominent
spot on it for the logo of their parent
company TCL who's four hundred dollar
budget TV we actually really liked in
our recent review along with some
messaging about how they relied on T
sales screen expertise in order to
develop the three V's display now it
doesn't go as dark or as bright
so it's contrast compared to some
flagship tier phones especially ones
with OLED displays is not that
impressive but it's got a non vivid mode
which I really appreciate seeing and for
the vast majority of users in day to day
applications it is unlikely to be a
problem unless you want to use it in
direct sunlight outside or something
along those lines or if you want to use
it to watch movies on Netflix so I fired
up the beginning scene of four ragnarok
which well speakers aren't sorry sorry
also this isn't the beginning scene and
it looks so dark and so low contrast and
even low res that I was kind of taken
aback and I was prompted to send an
email to Netflix and they haven't gotten
back to me but as far as I can tell the
low resinous of it anyway seems to have
to do with the display not being HDR
certified so when I watched this movie
side-by-side with the galaxy s 9 plus
the s9 it looks so much better that even
through our camera then through your
screen at home you should be able to
pretty easily see the differences in the
fine details here so I can't think
you're out why it is that HDR
certification which is more of a
contrast and color thing is affecting
the resolution they're serving but it's
something that I've repeated on other
phones as well other things are handled
reasonably well though so aspect ratio
controls are
down either through a big list in the
settings menu or and this is kind of
cool on the fly app by app with this
little button right here so if you run
into a compatibility issue with the
wider or taller aspect ratio display you
can easily fix it just by clicking that
button and in general actually the
software is not awful like it's not
stock Android but whether it was a
conscious decision or a cost-saving one
the android 8.0 Oreo on this thing is
pretty bare but pretty functional it's
definitely a brighter point than the
camera which is far from the worst that
I've ever seen even on a value device
but that writer joke haha brighter point
was because it constantly under exposes
my shots and this is true of both stills
and videos anyway I mean it's usable in
lots of light and it's certainly better
for capturing the moment than absolutely
nothing and I always appreciate a
double-click to quick launch the camera
gesture but naturally it lacks fancy
features like image stabilization so
even though I went out of my way to grab
a more modest competitor for this thing
the honor 10 rather than like a flagship
iPhone 10 or something it's clearly a
noticeably inferior but inferior doesn't
mean complete garbage it's charging is a
little bit slow but the 3000 milliamp
hour battery combined with the low-end
hardware means that over a day will be
easy to achieve for most people and NFC
is missing but dual band Wi-Fi which is
far more important in my opinion and
used to be left out of value phones like
this is present now it's only got 16
gigs of storage on 150 dollar model
which means that you won't be installing
a ton of heavy apps like games but it's
got microSD expansion so as long as you
don't load up tons of apps at least you
can store your Plex or your Netflix
download somewhere rather than having
the phone fill up all the time and start
behaving really weirdly like my
mother-in-law's old 8 gig phone I think
we're pretty close to the end here let's
see the speaker is pretty quiet which
affects speaker phone calls
and watching movies but it does have a
headphone jack so there's that and I
would be floored if you get a ton of
software updates but this was
enlightening for me I'm actually really
impressed at how much phone you can get
for a hundred and fifty bucks even if I
like wouldn't want to switch to it like
I personally I would probably go for a
contract subsidy instead but that is not
an option
for everyone memory Express is your
go-to destination in Canada for
electronics products and services if it
