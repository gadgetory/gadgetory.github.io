powered by the HyperX YouTube channel
check it out at youtube.com slash
Kingston HyperX also thank you to
phantom glass and lynda.com
welcome to the back of the msi booth
where they're having a really cool
drop-in gaming tournament casted by pros
but what we're interested in is their
gaming 24 GE 4k and like its namesake it
has a 4k screen it won't tell me a ton
about the hardware inside because it's
still under NDA but I do know that I'll
have a fourth-generation i7 and a 900
series GTX graphics card but not much
other than that that being said there
will be different SKUs available for
this AIO so you'll be able to get a
range of 4th gen i7 processors and a
range of 900 series graphics cards I'm
just not entirely sure which ones also
probably be 930 series mobile cards I
should specify that sorry now this is an
AI oh and it has an L bracket stand much
like an iMac and I don't know if an iMac
has this but this MSI AAO is compatible
with base amounts which is really cool
so if you're going for an a i/o for its
base saving capabilities you would also
be able to mount this up to a face arm
which could save even more space it is
an extremely slim aao as you can see
compared to their old unit and inside of
this aao they also have MSI's
traditional military classic components
and killer networking that 4k screen i
mentioned earlier is 10-point capacitive
touchscreen unlike their old models who
will actually be able to use it as touch
which again is cool as an AIO especially
if you had at base the mountain also
just so you guys know there's three
internal SSDs of varying sizes depending
on what SKU you design over and to
complete the package it also comes with
em aside peripherals like their keyboard
and mouse alright guys they get a HyperX
