exciting product I've had quite a few
requests to take a look at this guy
this is the G 75 V more specifically is
the ASD 75 V W underscore V 3 GM def 181
/u 3-1 basically this is the Asus G 75
this is their next generation IV Ridge
gaming notebook which not only has next
generation Ivy Bridge processing behind
the CPU it also has next generation
graphics powered by Nvidia 600 series
GPUs so this is an incredibly exciting
product and it comes with the targets
backpack I'm gonna let that sink in
target's backpack oh no but seriously
you guys it has like a republic of
gamers branded thing going on here and
for an included backpack I can already
tell you guys it feels really good
there's actually genuinely padding on it
whereas most like free bonus gift
backpacks are usually pretty horrible so
yeah there you go got like a sous
branding on the the lining and then your
notebook goes in there your other stuff
you know I'm not going to spend too much
time on the backpack here but I feel
like I should just kind of show it to
you at least alright so there's your
included ROG backpack here's one is
presumably and included ROG Mouse okay
go
it's got like a dpi just button scroll
wheel you know some buttons they go here
here and here some rubberized grips
slippy pads on the bottom pretty basic
I mean handy to have an extra melt don't
get me wrong but I get a real gaming
mouse if you try to care about that sort
of thing so before we get into the
specifics of the G 75 let's talk about
general Asus advantages so Isis knows
how to manufacture things sort of goes
without saying they are experts so take
that to the bank
number two is they stand behind the
things they manufacture you have a
one-year warranty covering accidental
damage drops spills power surges and
fire damage holy crap normally that cost
you an extra what out of 150 bucks on an
Apple probably something along those
lines more Moore's like is sort of
indicating to me
24-hour toll-free phone support target
is three business day turnaround time
for repair and replacement and free
one-way standard shipping from a soos to
the user so you do have to ship it back
to them two year international warranty
so it's one year of accidental damage
two year overall warranty zero right
guarantee on the screen to a free
standard shipping okay I don't
understand which of these is going on
here but 24/7 tech support so all that's
on there either way a soos does stand
behind their products they do have the
best default warranty that I'm aware of
you can get better extended warranties
than this on products but not out of the
box not without paying a bunch more
money um ok 17.3 inch full HD LED
backlit screen USB 3 I don't know what
that has to do with the LCD maybe we'll
figure that out later
okay without 3G without TV 6x blu-ray on
this particular SKU okay we've got a 36
10 Q M that's a quad core i7 it's 256
gig SSD boot drive and 750 gig 7200 rpm
drive that is the perfect drive
configuration goldstar a sous for
getting it exactly right because we see
a lot of dual bay notebooks that are
configured with like dual hard drives
and raid 0 or like one hard drive in
them by default no you need a buddhist
st you need a mass storage drive perfect
and you need a high speed mass storage
drive 7200 rpm drive good job isus 16
gigs of ram Windows 7 premium and all
that looks sort of pretty I can't
believe that on a gaming notebook they
actually don't have a GPU spec on the
spec sheet simply phenomenal okay well
guess we'll figure out it's probably a
675 in if it is what I think it is but I
was sort of expecting it to say for sure
on the side of the unit
whatever power brick is as we've come to
expect with gaming notebooks not exactly
small so you know if you were expecting
it to be petite then you can expect to
be disappointed but you have to power a
lot of power to a powerful notebook so
that's that's how they that's how we
roll
a couple speaker grilles it looks like
okay so we'll find out what those are
for after power cable to go with your
power brick and power battery to go with
your like power power biceps both on the
package battery notice I believe the
battery is only one year warranty or
like ninety day or something usually the
battery has a lesser warranty than the
rest although it looks like I'm totally
wrong this has nothing to do with that
it just has to do with making sure you
don't dispose of it in fire which is the
terrible idea
I mean you shouldn't dispose of almost
anything if it's not made of paper you
shouldn't be disposing of it in fire
okay can we just sort of all agree on
that any wood woods okay but not painted
wood you know these are common-sense
things but Asus sort of is explaining to
us which is I mean nice of them it's
it's good that they don't want us to you
know real toxic fumes and destroy
emulate our environment but seems a
little self-explanatory so there's your
battery pack yeah kind of throw the
thing in there and pop the thing in
there and you're good to go the bottom
is covered in rubber grippies here here
here here here in here and these are
just plastic ones so that i think
they're just for looks but whatever so
they'd put a lot more support behind the
screen because the screen is big and
then they put less support behind the
rest of it because the rest of it is not
so big and I think that's all pretty
pretty straightforward so on the back of
the unit BAM ventilation huge heat sinks
here and here with heat pipes running
through them these are cooling that high
end GPU and that high-end quad core CPU
Kensington lock for security gorgeous
little branding accents there this this
looks really sharp it looks it almost
looks like imagine this kind of guy so
kites up from from back a little bit
further so I don't want this angle
there's your headlights
there's your emblem in the middle
there's your front grille sort of thing
looks like a performance vehicle I think
and that's a you know probably totally
off in terms of what their design
philosophy was for but it looks
fantastic on the side we've got two USB
3.0 SuperSpeed ports a blu-ray disc
player an SD card a microphone and
headphone jack on the front we have
indicator LEDs for a variety of
different things including caps lock
number lock Wireless hard drive activity
battery apparently a light bulb saving
power Wow two more USB three SuperSpeed
ports so no USB 2 we've got Thunderbolt
HDMI Gigabit Ethernet VGA good inclusion
because every once in a while you will
still need to output the VGA and it's
good to have it and so if it doesn't
have DVI you don't have those analog
pins in the DVI connector so you've got
digital analog great power in and let's
go ahead and open her up so the top is
again very beautiful this is pretty
similar to the last generation G 74 in
terms of the look of the hinge and the
look at the top of the unit Republic of
gamers badge and Asus logo on the back
look very very sharp you've got a soft
touch feel to the overall outside of the
unit which is very nice and it also
gives you a little bit of durability
it's harder to scratch soft touch than
it is something like a glossy plastic
surface ultimate fighting machine sure
why not
no more those protectors for the
keyboard against the the screen itself
and this is all this is nice you got
like a brushed aluminum ii thing going
on here let's see if it's got enough of
a charge to turn over right out of the
box here so brushed aluminum on
backplane for your keyboard which is LED
backlit i'm going to turn off the lights
in the room for a second so you guys can
see what the what the backlight looks
like it's beautiful i love white LED
backlights um i think in my favourites
kind of go like green and then white and
then like other solids booting up right
now you've got a full number pad and no
glaring errors on the keyboard layout
full-size shift full-size shift
backspace and enter wonderful perfect
way to go a soos because it kills me
when I see keyboard layouts that are
that are broken due to the notebook
however it's easier on a 70
than it is on smaller form factor
notebooks so you know there you go
right so it has a GTX 670 M which is a
pretty beefy graphics card and that'll
go with the quad core processor so I'm
just going to put a demo game um I guess
I don't know they're going to be using
this at the no I don't want a Bing bar
are you kidding me oh man
okay these recommended settings we are
in Pacific time tech tips n doesn't have
any internet account activity right now
anyway I thought I was getting a call
but it's my Twitter feed going that's
for some reason um okay so moving on
you've got all the usual hotkeys here so
you got your brightness up and down
you've got your keyboard brightness up
and down your wireless sleep external
display internal display turn off the
touchpad and your audio controls I
wouldn't have minded seeing media
control here huh there's your play pause
back forward and stop ah love that
dedicated stop button so many devices
aren't doing dedicated stop buttons
anymore because they're like oh no pause
is good enough because positive good
enough for Apple um Apple started this
with no stop button stop means like off
go away and so good job we've also got
there I shoot I forget what the branding
name for this is but it controls all
your different power modes and all of
that so that's your your function for
the for the spacebar here we go
gamer friendly ergonomic design
intelligent cooling + easy clean system
easy clean system makes it easy clean no
way look at that so you can either open
this up with one screw fantastic or you
can open up this with one screw and
clean out the cooler see that's the deep
manufacturing expertise understanding
the challenges and then just like
addressing it instead of ignoring it
that that is what sets apart and I still
have no idea what these are for but ah
moving right along like are they for
like okay how do I got
I'm sorry good CPU GPU extreme
performance it sure does oh right so I
have left out the best part for last it
has two year warranty etc etc comes with
mcafee internet security as well as a
Seuss's web storage that's handy as well
as instant on oh that's cool
so it uses it uses Intel's latest
chipset technology to instantly power
bomb so here I'll show you guys because
I'm sure this is going to work even
though this is a completely live demo
and you can see what a difference the
SSD makes if you guys have ever turned
on a new computer oh crap ask me later :
if you guys have ever turned on a new
computer then you probably know that
they don't usually turn on that fast and
initialize for the first time SSD is
amazing and everyone should have one so
we're going to go into sleep and we're
going to see when it goes into sleep I'm
so confident that this will be faster
since late and we're going to turn it on
and it is going to be on and bam
instant-on excellent right so best for
last this screen is what I'm all about
so you can see right here there's a
built in transmitter what is that for
oh there's a webcam too but every
notebook has a webcam ah there's a
built-in transmitter so what is that for
that is for your okay I'm just going to
go away I'm going to find the ball oh
wait for it that is for your ball and
out 3d vision glasses because this
notebook display is 3d vision ready and
3d vision ready with light boost if you
guys remember any of what I've said
about light boost in the past then um I
don't need to say this next part but if
you don't then I do light boost is
amazing light boost takes the 3d vision
experience from for me a little bit
headache-inducing after about 30 seconds
too comfortable and awesome light boost
is amazing it not only increases the
brightness of the display when you're in
3d mode with the 3d glasses it also
dramatically
uses the crosstalk between the images
which is what I get the headache from
where I can see a little bit of the left
eye image through my right eye because
the panel isn't switching fast enough
and it's not modulating the backlight in
order to optimize it for me so that is
fantastic
I love light boost it is amazing it is
magical it's like it's like I could
stand up and deliver a keynote speech
about how it is magical and I would
actually genuinely believe myself unlike
some things that have been presented as
magical in the past so there you go
1080p light boost ready 3d vision
display awesome awesome performance and
yeah it's not a it's kind of heavy but
that's sort of life when you have a
gaming notebook thank you for checking
