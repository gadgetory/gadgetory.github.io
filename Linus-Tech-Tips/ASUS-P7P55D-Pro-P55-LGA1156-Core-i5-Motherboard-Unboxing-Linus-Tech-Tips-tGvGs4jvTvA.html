we actually can't get over to our normal
unboxing outside place because there's
some junk there and so we're doing the
unboxing on the hood of my car so here
we go we got the IO shield and then
let's keep going to the accessories here
we've got the user's guide then we've
got the DVD for your drivers and your
utilities all that good stuff okay then
we have an eSATA USB IO bracket then
we've got an IDE cable then we've got
their convenient you connect then we
have four SATA ports it's got four SATA
ports so four SATA cables and now let's
get to the board itself here so a soos
uses environmentally friendly no foam
packaging so they have like no foam and
no no packing peanuts nothing like that
it's all sort of cardboard so let's get
the board itself out it's kind of a
sharp looking board I can't say the
color scheme is my favorite but it all
sort of matches so let's start with what
we've got in terms of our ports so we've
got three PCI Express 16x slot set 8 X 8
X + 4 X and please note that this one
will run at 16 X if there's nothing
installed here
as with all p55 boards we've got support
for dual channel ddr3 memory you've got
a fairly beefy 12 + 2 phase power design
which is really nice to see especially
because this board is a relatively
low-cost board compared to some of the
more premium ones like the Maximus and
all that kind of stuff over here we've
got 7 SATA ports which seems like kind
of a weird number of SATA ports except
that if you look at the back which is
right about here you can see that we've
got a nice ADA so that would probably be
where our other port is and also looking
at the rest of the back we've got our
ps2 keyboard mouse we have overall 8 USB
ports digital audio firewire you give it
Ethernet and 7.1 audio in terms of
layout the board is quite quite well
done you've got your 24 pin over here
and then you've got your 8 pin up at the
top of the board over here with the
little cover and then you've got kind of
a cool actually if I could
yeah cameraman is checking out that
heatsink and that's so that's your
chipset heatsink and then I want you to
check these out from the side these are
actually kind of a unique design I
really I really like that it's just sort
of look feels kind of random and
basically I don't know it seems like a
trivial thing to like about a board but
there you go anyway so that's the p7 p55
D Pro thanks for checking it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
