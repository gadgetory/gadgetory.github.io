our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys in the sharp booth the first
thing we checked out is the flexible LED
display so this is only a three point
four inch model they've got two
prototypes on display here they have all
the same benefits that were used to
seeing with 0 LED that is to say they
have more vibrant colors better contrast
ratios lower power consumption all of
that good stuff however now all of a
sudden you can see that with there's one
demo there where it's curved by default
and then there's another one over here
on the right where they've actually got
it flexing in real time that
dramatically increases the applications
that we can use this technology for now
this these particular ones right here
implement sharps XO technology which
does a couple of things number one is
that it is a highly sensitive touch
panel technology and number two is that
it actually reduces the power
consumption again compared to other
approaches for when when it comes to LED
screens now you might say okay Oh LED is
already very efficient why do we care
and the answer is if you want to build a
larger format panel or if you want to
pack more pixels into it power
consumption becomes a factor again so
the great thing about this is unlike so
many things we see at CES this isn't
actually science fiction unlike you know
the product that was in the sony booth
where no one from the booth had actually
even heard of this or seen it they
basically pulled it out of a box put it
in a display stand and no one knows what
it is this could be produced tomorrow if
a partner of sharp said hey look we were
going to cut a p.o we want you to
produce this let's get it done very very
exciting stuff now 4k is here and now
and sharp is launching a couple of
models this year one of them in the
summer and the other one in sort of the
second half of 2013's oh that's a
60-inch first and then a 70 inch however
on display here at the booth they have
what they're calling the future of
television
is an AK 85 inch TV that is actually
displaying native 8k content so the
difference between for kak quite simply
is for but but not before you're
thinking of not not not 4000 actually it
is four times the resolution of 4k
content so what I'd like is for my
cameraman here to get up close and
personal with this TV sharp is
encouraging visitors to the show to get
as close to the TV as they want and see
if they can actually make out the
individual pixels and standing about 60
centimeters away from it I would say no
you actually can't see an individual
pixel so this is still voodoo magic this
is still not not-ready-for-prime-time by
any stretch of the imagination but maybe
five ten years down the road will
actually be getting a k content
broadcast to our homes or at least
available on some kind of future science
fiction media thanks for watching linus
