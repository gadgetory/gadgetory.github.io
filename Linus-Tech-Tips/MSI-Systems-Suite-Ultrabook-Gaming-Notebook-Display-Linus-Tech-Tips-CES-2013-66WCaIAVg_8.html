our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys now we're in the MSI system
suite where we've got a few different
notebooks on display there's a gt70 here
which has the steelseries zoned lit
backlit keyboard you know it's a just
generally a better keyboard than you
will usually find on a typical notebook
right here though this one is gorgeous
so this has an intel quad-core processor
it has a geforce 680m actually just like
the other two that are on the table in
front of me it has a killer next 16 gigs
of ram 128 gig SSD plus a 128 gig SSD
you for real yes crazy oh okay tell us
about this storage configuration
actually it's God got our super raid
system actually it's got two SSDs
running in a raid 0 configuration so
your primary dr plus a hard drive so
your primary drives are as fast as
possible you could load minecraft in
like really the the fastest possible
speed oh good thank you i was concerned
about how quickly i could load minecraft
here we've got the GT 60 which is
basically a 15 inch version also has the
steelseries keyboard also has a 6 ATM
and is also a quad-core now I'd like to
move over to this little number right
over here this is the gx60 so what's
special about this Alex I mean we can
clearly see you've got a bunch of
monitors on the table but why have you
done that the gx60 is special because
it's got the AMD Radeon HD 7970m and
using this mobile processor mobile
graphics processors so you could
actually run eyefinity on a notebook and
this is something that's uh you know
usually I finished he or any
multi-display gaming is usually reserved
for desktop you know graphic cards and
desktop systems but this is the first
for mobile system now you're probably
not going to be running far cry 3 at
full details on something like this but
from a Productivity standpoint it would
be great to be able to plug in at home
fire up two additional monitors and so
you can game on the notebook you can use
three displays for your office
applications yeah but I mean
you were running like a dx9 game that's
a little bit less I as far as the
graphics is concerned and even if you
limit down the resolution of the
secondary monitors you can actually play
at a you know pretty decent framerate
very cool stuff finishing up the NSI
system sweet we have a couple of really
cool notebooks you might notice that
they look very similar to the gaming
notebooks that we just saw before but
the key difference is that these include
quadro graphics cards so this guy is the
k1000 and the guy on your right is the
k2000 what that means is when you're
accelerating professional applications
you are going to be able to take
advantage of not only the performance
acceleration you get from CUDA but also
some of the quadrille optimizations that
are made in the driver and in the GPU so
Alex can you tell us why these look like
the gaming models the biggest the
biggest reason why these are the look
like the gaming models is because the
quadrille GPU itself actually looks very
it's not something that looks it's a
very similar to the desktop geforce very
version and the gaming notebooks have
the proper thermal in place so design
wise to vent the heat from the quadrille
chips themselves now I would like to you
know pull off a little magic trick and
I'm going to pull the coolest thing in
the MSI system sweet out of my
proverbial buttocks and chose you guys
this freaking cool ultrabook so it looks
like a tablet but they're calling it
ultrabook why is it called an ultrabook
because boom not only that but you can
adjust the angle you want to use it at
it's a little bit stiff so that you can
basically put it wherever you want so
this is a core i5 what are you guys
calling this guy this is called the this
is called the s20 slider it's obviously
uh sliding and and you can actually use
it as a tablet you could use it for for
multiple things you know and you can
also download all of the apps off of the
the xbox live store I think whatever
they call them whatever they call it i'm
not i haven't used up use this just this
this particular setup yet so so guys
it's got an IPS screen 10-point
multi-touch and unlike a lot of tablets
check this out you've actually got
things like ethernet
connectivity you've got here we go again
H mini-hdmi you've got two USB 3.0 ports
so this really is an ultrabook because
you have to build those into your
specification to get that ultrabook
stamp of approval from Intel but you can
use it as a tablet and what kind of
battery life are you getting out of this
guy it's got pretty the battery life
it's good it's a good five or six hours
if not longer I actually have an opt
tested the entire you know think to its
full extent you know but you can
extrapolate based on how long its
lasting here at the show while you're
showing yeah yeah when one charger
basically last us so practically the
entire days worth of you know regular
just messing around on ms paint or
whatever alright guys so don't miss any
of our CES 2013 coverage and as always
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips and big thanks to msi for showing
us around the sweet thanks for watching
