unboxing of an accessory product so this
is an antec notebook power adapter which
looks completely unexceptional from this
angle and I will explain why it is
exceptional in just a moment so the
first thing this is a kind of an
upgraded version of there NP 90 which
stands for as far as I can tell notebook
power 90 90 means 90 watts so we have a
universal notebook power adapter oh okay
table they gave away the secret on me
here slimmer is better so the SNP 90 is
a slimmer version of the NP 90 so we're
going to get out of the box really
shortly here and while I'm opening the
box um that's cool it's conveniently
already kind of broken on the model for
me maybe happened in shipping or
something but that makes my life easier
because this kind of packaging is like
an unboxers worst nightmare arch nemesis
because it's like impossible to do it
cleanly never cut boards yourself kids
do not do this at home I am a
professional unboxing after all hey
there we go so here we got some adapters
we got a notebook power adapter we got a
paper sleeve and take that out that's
pretty much it for packaging so yeah
like I said I wanted camera bag to have
a look for you guys at the compatibility
list for the SNP 90 and so you can
easily see whether your notebook is
compatible there's probably ones that
are compatible that aren't on there but
it's pretty hard to keep those
completely up to date all the time so
here's also all of the included plugs
note there's one more that's already
attached to the unit hopefully I can
figure out how to remove it that's not
too hard so there you are those are all
of the included plugs so let's have a
look at the SNP 90 and why do people
need a slim notebook power adapter will
the reason is that if you pack it in a
briefcase or in a backpack or in any
other place where it'd be useful to have
it be not so bulky well why is it that
all notebook power adapters are like
this pic when most modern notebooks are
more like this thick so there's often no
easy way to put your adapter into like a
notebook briefcase or or a case or
anything like that so that's why this
product exists and it's actually been
selling quite well so it seems like
there is a demand for that so it just
has a power cord here on the one side
and then a power cord here on the other
side so the swappable pieces go on like
this so just come and have a close look
at that you can see there's there's two
holes there and one of them is positive
one of them is negative so you just go
ahead and plug that guy in there and
find the one that works now this one
runs at 19 volts and provides up to 4.7
four amps at 19 volts so make sure that
your notebook accepts a 19 volt input
before you even try to use this
particular adapter and then also double
check that the ahead is compatible with
the power jack on your notebook so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
SNP 90 and don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other great computer videos
at least I think they're great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
