and first look at the kingston
datatraveler 101 which I have want to
plugged into my laptop here that I never
really took a close look at the your
drive software so I'm going to take some
time and adjust the tripod feet on my
camera here and then I will take some
time to find out exactly what's what
with your drive so I'm going to accept
the terms and conditions and get this
thing installed and oh it's installed
already okay that was easy okay so uh
let's find out what exactly your drive
does so first we can find out what's new
with Kingston okay which takes us to the
Kingston website so that's useful next
we have a secure browser I wonder what's
secure about it it's not launching oh
there we go you are currently running
desktop Firefox so to use the secure
browser from your USB Drive you should
close firefox which I will know do and
then relaunch it from here so this is
leung really i am not you liar there we
go portable protection browse safely on
any pc anywhere so i guess this doesn't
leave footprints behind wherever you
happen to be browsing century day there
you go gives you portable protection one
surfing the web it has a built in
antique keylogging protection okay and I
it also has built-in anti-phishing
production cool you can install enhanced
protection on up to three pcs okay well
there's that so put your app zone let's
find out what's in your app zone
wow there's some featured apps including
radar sync battle on GIMP portable cool
warzone 2100 filezilla audacity mplayer
was a little lightning extension so
there there's some apps that all them
yeah that's just I think that's sort of
all of them so here's the top 25 which
seems like it's pretty much most of them
okay so we're in the year app zone why
don't we go why don't we go back back to
home okay I can see my apps Kingston
news oh we've got SLS online backup cool
so purchasing entitles you to two gigs
of free SOS online backup to create your
account do this okay well that's kind of
a neat inclusion I mean it's hard to add
additional value to a USB Drive you know
when everyone kind of has the same basic
products so what else we got here
password manager okay so this is for
managing passwords for websites and
whatnot oh I disagree i'm not going to
install that right now okay so kingston
news you're up soon okay so this is all
links to the same stuff looking my
photos and my file so my files
presumably will just take us to the
files okay so you can see I some tech
tips project files on here and then my
photos will take me two photos which I
actually don't have my music will take
me of movies in my videos will take me
likely to okay well it didn't
automatically find the videos that are
on my USB Drive oh because I didn't put
them in this folder but I bet if I took
this and I put it in the video thing Oh
