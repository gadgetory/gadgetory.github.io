longer and perform optimally it needs to
stay cool which makes it all the more
confusing that Intel over the last few
generations at least according to
comments from the tech community has
been using seemingly the worst possible
thermal compound between the dyes of
their processors and the integrated heat
spreaders that go on top of them but the
problem is that the only way to evaluate
that thermal compound that we have now
is to take off the spreader replace it
with something else and check the
results but we're actually changing a
lot of variables when we do that so we
devised a test to find out once and for
all just how bad is Intel's thermal
paste Alex here has got an entire bag of
Intel CPUs with their junk thermal
compound and we're going to be
harvesting all of it and then comparing
it with the well-respected n-th one from
Noctua
a premium thermal paste on a deleted
liquid metal deck stream edition cpu so
come along for the ride tunnel bear
makes really simple privacy apps so
people can enjoy a more open Internet to
try it out for free visit tunnel bear
comm /l tt
to get a baseline we first needed to
apply some nth one thermal paste from
Noctua and mount the NHD 15 cooler that
we'd be using for our tests it performs
as well if not better than large a iOS
but is way easier to mount all of our
testing was done in our conference room
to keep em bein temperatures locked at
24 degrees at stock speeds with multi
core enhancement turned off and the CPU
fan at full blast while our control
thermal test was running we had some
time to begin what we're calling the
Grand Tim the harvest we aren't totally
sure if these processors work but we
don't want to just destroy them like so
many things deleting is pretty simple
when you have the right tools place the
CPU in the little vise tighten until the
top moves a bit and then remove the lid
which normally you would do by hand but
these ones seemed pretty reluctant to
let go and we wanted to get this over
with
once all the CPUs were opened we scraped
off all the thermal interface material
we could get at with a guitar pick and
then carefully placed it on an ESD bag
now you might be thinking guys those are
third gen core series chips that came
out six years ago how can this be a fair
comparison
well the longevity of Intel's pastes is
one of the main justifications that we
have heard for them using it also it's a
heck of a lot easier to get a bag of
third gen chips than 8th gen chips oh
the savagery look at this this is like
they came in and wrecked up the place
well you don't have to do that to them
wow that's a fair point ok so oh so this
is it yeah that's all of it right there
don't blow on it I'm not gonna blow on
it so this is our harvested thermal
interface material from four CPUs this
looks like it should be more than enough
for our 79 80 XE
after inspection we found that our first
application of thermal paste was
excellent
so these results should be perfect for
our comparison do you think there's like
a good way to get this on there I think
we're in uncharted waters here right now
I hadn't really given it a lot of
thought to be perfectly honest with you
several methods of applying the old
thermal goop were considered including
just placing it onto the CPU but without
a way to spread it around we were
concerned that we wouldn't get adequate
coverage mashing it into a ball seemed
promising but it just kind of flaked out
and turned into a weird powder finally
we turned to what seemed like the
soberest idea soaking it in alcohol not
doing anything yet Alex
although this doesn't seem like the best
of ideas it's actually not the worst
ever
either the alcohol should allow what is
currently thermal dust to turn back into
more of a paste for application and then
quickly evaporate away our spudger ended
up being too fine of a tool so we
swapped it out using the allen key from
the deleting tool as a makeshift pestle
for our bottle cap mortar making a
reconstituted thermal paste here spilled
the alcohol so ridiculous this alcohol
spill might have been a blessing in
disguise this may be one who can tell
this things we've ever done yeah I was
trying to think of Dumber things but
this is really up there and we try to
spread it out more I mean we've got the
particle size pretty small with the tin
spread out to the best of our abilities
all we could do was wait for the alcohol
to dry thank you
I guess we should just go for it now
we've committed this much time and
energy to the initial temperatures at
idle had a set just over six degrees
over ambient meaning that our
application
worked at least to some degree well it
might just be more idly now so like 30
walks before Philippi okay so you don't
think it's the material heating up and
spreading yeah I think it's just windows
is all the way started but we wouldn't
know how well it works until we hit it
with an intense load didn't I mean it
didn't instantly overheat but this is
now our earlier test gave us a maximum
temperature of 60 degrees and an average
temperature across the course of 50
degrees while maintaining a CPU power of
about a hundred and fifty watts with our
reconstituted Intel Tim we almost
immediately blew past that reaching a
maximum of up to 89 degrees
ouch before settling into an average of
75 degrees to be clear this is a totally
acceptable number that shouldn't harm
the processor within its expected
lifespan but 25 degrees more than the
enthusiasts solution still isn't great
but is the problem the paste or the
application this is the real moment of
truth because we weren't expecting it to
perform as well anyway right did it
spread
actually it did I think if we described
that as suboptimal but adequate it
doesn't seem to have liquid it up at all
so with our decent-enough application we
feel at this point that it's safe to say
that the 25 degree difference was at
least largely due to the poor thermal
conductivity of the paste that is inside
the CPU and supporting our theory is the
fact that this difference is actually
pretty close to the temperature
difference that you can achieve after
deleting a CPU and replacing that stock
thermal interface material so to answer
our original question there are a number
of variables that you
end up changing when swapping out
thermal paste in your dealin and
processor including mounting pressure
the thickness of the application the
silicone seal the flatness of the heat
spreader but as everyone expected its
Intel's choice of a longevity optimized
Tim rather than a performance optimized
one and their decision to eschew solder
that makes up the bulk of the difference
