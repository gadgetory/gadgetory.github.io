that properly all right so I've never
really intended to do this video but I
tweeted out about this a while ago and I
kind of went well I'm moving to x99 on
my personal rig I really like the
rampage v extreme I like that it has a
ps2 port it's just the best board I've
ever used in terms of general stability
and and awesomeness got a lot of great
features blah blah blah blah blah all
that stuff it's red I kind of went okay
so I could use the WS board which does
not have Wi-Fi it doesn't have a ps2
port which for me is pretty handy it
doesn't even have USB 2 ports which for
me are still kind of a necessity they do
two driverless nests and all that kind
of stuff
so I kind of went okay guys pull time
should I use the WS or should I paint
the rampage 5 Xtreme blue and it was
basically unanimous linus paint the
motherboard blue and I kind of went well
okay then so I started things off by
taking off the heatsinks from the back
of the motherboard using my screwdriver
basically you got to take off the
Southbridge heatsink the the vrm
heatsink on the back of the board
the little illuminated rog heatsink as
well as the the vrm heatsink thats it
says and covers the i/o as well
with a little plate here and so now that
that's all done this is pretty much it
we have stripped down the board and the
plan this word we're basically we're
basically in like uncharted uncharted
waters here I know that Paul Tann has
done this before
I believe that our rich cero's has done
something like this before although
you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong
but painting motherboards is not
something that's typically done so
there's a few different ways I've seen
people actually do it with with nail
polish but there's a lot to do on here
and we're not going to take that
approach so we have three different
sizes of painters green tape we're going
to mask off this board as best we can we
are actually going to paint over some of
the sockets that we are actually
planning to use such as the PCI Express
slots here
going to try not to get a ton of paint
in them but then we're going to try to
remove the paint from the contacts in
order to make them functional again we
may end up with a dead board we may not
I have no idea how this is going to go
down so here we go
ah the memory slots I kind of feel like
the longer I put these off the tougher
it's going to be on me if I don't just
kind of figure out a way to tackle it so
these ones have moving parts and I'm
thinking what I'll do is I'll leave them
kind of loose so I can try and fill in
as much as I can
no I think I'll leave them closed
because I can get good coverage on them
close and that way I won't interfere
with any of the moving removing this
if it wasn't for these caps I wouldn't
have any trouble with this I mean the
same can be said for any of this if it
wasn't for this being covered in things
that I don't want to paint
alright so the taping is now complete
it's not as perfect as I would have
liked actually I see one gap right now
that I'll definitely have to close up
somehow but what I'm hoping is that we
will get a good enough result that it
kind of achieves what we were kind of
trying to achieve okay yes I'm being
very vague about the goals functional
board and it looks like a blue board
that is what we are going for here and
if we can do that and I will be I'll be
pretty pleased so here we go
I think I've got the coverage as good as
it's going to get at this point it's
it's really not as good as I'd like
there's a there's a lot of board
components that are just so close to the
slots that I can't I can't really spray
in there properly so all that's really
left to do at this point then is start
peeling it away and and kind of hope for
the best here I don't think I got a ton
of overspray on places where I I didn't
want it but I do know that there was
some so oh yeah I can already oh wow I
can't believe I didn't cover that
properly all right well there's a bunch
on this PCI Express slot right here at
the back all that is a real shame
so we actually Wow we did we got a nice
clean line on those SATA ports that
looks really good that's probably one of
the one of the best finished parts of it
now I've been told that in in the bays
in the modding business there's a term
for something like this I think they
call it a ten-foot mod or something like
that
where it looks pretty good as long as
you stay about ten feet away I think
that might be what we're looking at here
I think this is a 10 foot mod because it
actually looks not bad as long as you as
long as you don't get too close and look
look at it under a magnifying glass all
right moment of truth memory slots let's
find out how we did not too shabby
it's actually not bad we've got to do
something about that overspray but well
we'll figure that out so that's it for
today this ended up taking a lot longer
than I was expecting and I don't have
time to wrap things up and still get
this video out today so in the
conclusion we'll be finding out if the
board actually works as well as covering
how we're going to hopefully get it to
that working state installing a 59 60 X
Extreme Edition as well as a GTX 980 in
it and hopefully determining that at
that point it'll be ready to put in my
personal rig where it will live happily
ever after browsing webpages uploading
YouTube videos and gaming at 720p for me
