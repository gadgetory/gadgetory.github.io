new and pretty exciting product this is
the Radeon 5970 and as you can see there
are two girls on the front and I suppose
what that means is that they want to
sell cards to geek male gamers but now
that I'm implying anything about our
target audience here but what it also
means is that there are two and by two
they need GPUs so this is a dual 5800
series card that is actually kind of
like two of a hybrid between a 5870 and
a 50/50 so it's somewhere between the
performance of 5850 crossfire and 5870
crossfire just like the rest of the 5000
series cards you've got DirectX 11
affinity support it does support ATI
crossfire X so you can actually run two
of these cards with four GPUs for
extreme gaming that kind of experience
so let's get this box open up here okay
it's fairly heavy actually for a
graphics card that is extremely heavy
and this card is a monster in terms of
size which we are about to find out yeah
so the video cards almost the only thing
in here so here is the download URL for
their overclocking and tweaking utility
okay there's the video card itself I'd
like to do the accessory package first
though normally so let's have a look at
what we've bought included with this
card so you got a crossfire bridge
alright then they have oh this is
interesting so this is a mini
DisplayPort to display port adapter okay
then you have a DVI to VGA adapter then
you have a DVI to HDMI adapter
alright lots of adapters see a molex to
PCI Express 6 pin adapter okay then we
have an installation driver CD don't use
this just download the latest drivers
off a ti.com full game coupon for
BattleForge full game coupon for dirt to
my do not all of the Sapphire cards
included dirt 2 as we found out today a
to molex to one 8 pin PCI Express
adapter you know what if you don't have
the right PCI Express plugs on your on
your power supply though you shouldn't
be buying this card you
should be buying a new power supply yeah
anyway there's the manual it just it
doesn't make sense to be people who are
buying like a six hundred dollar card
should have a proper power supply to
power it you want to make sure you're
doing that so let's get this out of the
anti-static baggie here which is it
seems to be like packed inside like two
bags oh no there's like foamies in there
to protect this end of the card so that
is one heck of a long video card we've
got similar sort of graphic on the card
itself we've got one fan at the back
here this is a PCI Express what is the
iPhone here for oh you want me to use it
as as like a size comparison okay there
you go it's like it's big as like a
jillion iPhones okay so this is a PCI
Express 2.0 card and it has one six pin
and one eight pin power connector that
are required like I said before just
just get a power supply that supports it
here you can see that's got like a black
shroud cooling the back of the card as
well as gaps for where the two GPUs are
located there in terms of ports on the
back of the card itself I got our ATI
Radeon branding here we have two DVI and
one mini DisplayPort so that's how
you're gonna get your three displays out
for Eyefinity and they're unlike the 58
70 and fifty eight fifty we have a full
slot for exhaust instead of a half slot
I really like to see that they've
improved that last thing we've got let
me see on the top actually I'm gonna
turn this camera man doesn't want me to
do that but there that's the crossfire
finger so if you're installing two of
these monsters you're gonna need to
install your crossfire bridge there
there's the bottom of the card there's
nothing particularly interesting there
and then there's our Batmobile looking
front of the cards so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and overview of
the Radeon HD 59 70</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
