got a couple sweet things to show you
guys so these kind of go together but
they kind of don't welcome to Linus tech
tips at CES 2013 our trip to the show
this year is powered by Corsair maker of
quality PC components and peripherals
our trusted storage partner is Seagate
technology and our trusted networking
partner is Linksys
number one is the Zenbook touch so this
is a full HD Zen book it's running
Windows 8 it is touch enabled I I loved
Windows 8 with touch Windows 8 without
touch isn't as good of an experience in
my opinion and there's a couple things
that were challenging for implementing
touchscreen notebooks especially at the
beginning number one is it does add some
thickness and you have to meet that
specification from Intel in terms of the
overall thickness of the unit so let's
just let's just go through and validate
sort of okay is it still super thin
absolutely at its thickest point it's
just over the thickness of an iPhone 4
you still got micro HDMI out you still
got VGA out with an adapter super speed
USB 3 DC in so there's your power a
front very very very slim Isis has done
such a beautiful job of the finishing on
here oh did you get that did you miss
that
there we go you got it now alright I'm
getting the eyebrow lift that means he's
got it another super speed USB 3
headphones and SD card at the back you
find nothing very very very clean
overall design they've maintained that
they have added a multi-touch pen so
here we go now we can use the Ultrabook
the way that it truly is meant to be
used because desktops the screens too
far away to really to really touch it
all the time but with an ultrabook now
you can carry around like this you can
sort of click away on it like this you
can touch it when that's appropriate so
you can you know go look at the weather
and you can basically you can use it
however you want I wouldn't personally
buy an ultrabook without touch so if
you're looking for a Zen book it's going
to be worth the extra couple bucks
pick up the Zen book touch Core i5 or
Core i7 13.3 inch for this particular
guy and as always it's running Intel HD
graphics it's pretty hard to put like
you know gtx 680 and something like a
touch something freaking culture book
backlit keyboard looks absolutely
beautiful it's hard to tell in here with
all the light but if we were able to
kind of cover it up somewhat for you
you'd be able to get a better look at
that can you see ok there we go just
gorgeous so alright moving on to the
very drive so one of the prime
complaints about ultrabooks and
small form-factor anything is expansion
you know yeah I love it but you know I
miss having you know hardwired gigabit
ethernet I miss this I miss that
ok say goodbye to all that because this
guy right here is basically the answer
to your prayers it's just a little
all-in-one unit that acts like an
expander so instead of plugging into a
doc where it's like this huge bulky
thing on your desk in order to get a
crease increased style you just use this
guy there's a slit a slot loading
optical drive in the top nice sort of
soft touch finish on the back so it's
not gonna go anywhere it's not gonna
fall down it's not gonna move once you
put it down on the side you've got USB 3
here's the USB 3 input and the power in
2 more USB 3 so this adds two additional
USB 3 out USB 3 ports to your ultrabook
or your other PC Ethernet and you get
more output options that are using more
standard connectors rather than
something like micro HDMI for example
it's not limited to just being used with
something like a Zen book though you can
use it with whatever you want but I
think anyone who enjoys mobile computer
I mean check this out it's not even that
big so if you have you know like a
backpack and you got your ultra book in
there you keep this in one of the other
pockets now you have the benefits of
super ultra mobile computing plus super
ultra versatile computing and I made
both of those things up so I should put
a little TM so that no one steals my
thing so this has been another video in
the a su suite at CES 2013 make sure you
guys are subscribed because we're going
to show you all kinds of cool stuff here
this week
