unboxing of the liquid armor invisible
nano coating tech screen protector and
what I said was that at the time I
didn't really have a way to validate
whether this stuff works or not so what
it claims is that with the liquid
coating you basically just spray it on a
screen wipe it in one direction and
leave it for 24 hours to cure or even I
think it's just uh whatever it's not
that long to dry and then 24 hours to
cure and it will make your screen up to
2 times stronger than traditional screen
protectors which sounds pretty good
right but unless you validate it then
it's just a claim on a box so slick and
I came up with an experiment today where
we're taking two dummy foams so these
are blackberry curve in a BlackBerry
Bold and we're gonna drag them on string
behind my motorcycle we're gonna drag
them screen side down and I wrote on the
backs of them so this one is our liquid
armor coated one you're welcome you're
not going to be able to read that you
can read it oh cool and this is our
control group one so the bold has been
coated with liquid armor three days ago
and the curve has not been coated with
liquid armor at all so we're going to
tie these down and we're going to drag
them down to the end of this and see if
there's actually any difference in the
scratched up Ness all the screens when
we're done so stay tuned guys this is
going to be fun
so I don't know if you guys notice this
I don't know if you can see it in the
camera but here I'm going to try I'll
try and catch them on my sweater it's
actually snowing right now so I don't
know why this always happens it must be
slick because every time I film
something outside with him it starts
freaking snowing so anyway we're set up
now there's the two phones
ah here we go
all right so you guys are going to be
here for the results so this is our
control phone and this is our
liquid-armor phone so let's do the
control phone first so you can see the
control phone is scratched too high hell
the only part we're really going to be
looking at here though guys is the
screen itself because this is going to
be the same on both phones here actually
we should wipe it off so that we get a
good representation okay and this part
has not been coated with liquid armor on
the other one so you can see how
scratched up the screen is can you see
pretty well um how about like a better
angle
does that help okay good we got it all
right here is the liquid armor phone so
let's see
ah
Oh hold on a second Oh check it out the
scratched up coating is the liquid armor
look at that guys I didn't realize it
was going on so thick so you see how
scratched up the screen is right but
then when I Oh check this out no this
actually works I was pretty disappointed
at first there but look at this if I
scrape the liquid armor back off you're
supposed to reapply it every six months
or so the screen is actually not
scratched holy smokes look at that okay
so guys the answer is liquid armor
actually freaking works even if you drag
your phone behind you on a motorcycle I
got up to about 3035 kilometers an hour
huh I was not expecting this stuff to
work nearly that well so I'm officially
done with stupid screen protectors with
their stupid app applicator cardboards
and all that kind of crap because this
is amazing so thank you for checking out
this episode of - tech tips and don't
forget to subscribe for more videos like
well not very many videos like this but
mostly unboxings and like tech videos
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
