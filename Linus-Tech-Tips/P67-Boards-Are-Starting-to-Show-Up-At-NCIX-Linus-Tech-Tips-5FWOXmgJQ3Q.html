couple of different things in the past
and I am holding true to my word that I
never gave you guys but I'm doing this
anyway I am letting you know when the b3
stepping that is the corrected Intel p67
boards start arriving so you can see
here at our warehouse we've actually got
the p67 a ud7 be three so the b3 in the
part number means it has the corrected
chipset and I'm also giving you guys a
sneak peek at the NCIX warehouse
although a very very small sneak peek
okay so I'll show you some of the other
boards that are starting to arrive with
the corrected intel chipset as you can
see there really aren't many this
particular skew there's only a few
remember that the priority is obviously
replacing the boards for customers who
already bought them so there aren't too
many left to sell they're just trickling
in right now so here's some p67 aud for
be threes and let's see if we can find
something else but we should have enough
to start selling them full-scale over
the next you know sort of week or two as
the shipment start to come in here's one
where we actually have enough quantity
that we can start start selling this guy
so this is the age 67 aud 3hb 3 so you
can see that gigabyte marks there be
three boards with this badge right here
and so gigabyte is the first one that
has updated boards in our warehouse oh
here's one more to actually there's a
p67 aud 5 b 3 as well it looks like
we've got enough of those we can start
selling those too thanks for checking
out this little video you don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos so yeah I'm pulling my usual
stunt where that wasn't actually the end
of the video cuz I'm on my way back to
the tech tips room here and I saw
something you guys might like in a
remote corner of the warehouse there's
like a couple pallets of corsair 650d s
that are stacked so i just thought you
guys might enjoy that brand new case
very cool very exciting so once again
