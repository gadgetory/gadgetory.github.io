exciting about a microphone you might
ask well I wasn't sure either in fact
when the press release first hit my
inbox I completely ignored it and it
wasn't until I received numerous tweets
asking when I was going to review it
that I went ahead and sent over a sample
request so I could evaluate razors
expansion into an entirely new category
microphones that actually sound good by
the way this is the part where I would
normally tease an upcoming video but I
can't this time and I guess that's all I
can really say cooler masters casemod
world series is your opportunity to show
off your modding skills and win great
prizes entries close February 7th 2015
click now to learn more so let's open
with the packaging something that I
rarely do these days but in this case I
feel like it's warranted first in the
box we've got some stickers a very long
braided mini USB cable and a QuickStart
guide which I've asked them to revise
since it makes absolutely no mention of
installing synapse on the page that
appears to have all of the steps and if
you don't install synapse then windows
seems to install a driver but the
microphone just doesn't work a
frustrating issue the good news is that
if you don't care about adjusting the
grand total of two parameters within the
software you can uninstall it and use
the mic like any other USB audio input
next is some of the finest packing foam
ever a nice dense soft foam that feels
like it would be as much at home in a
carrying case as a product box a really
nice touch if you're someone like a game
broadcaster who might actually travel
with it now Razer could have taken this
one step further and made the box a
carrying case but not this time although
who knows maybe siren v2 Razer which
leads us to the microphone itself and
these guys are good at taking the most
mundane things like keyboards mice and
now microphones and turning them into
industrial artwork I mean what's next
webcams actually I better not give them
any ideas the surprisingly well-built
aluminum stand has a foam covered base
and two arms that have large thumb bolts
running through them to hold the mic in
place but that also allow it a degree of
movement to compensate for the height of
the user
I feel like Razer missed an opportunity
to use rubber instead of plastic here
for better resistance to desk vibrations
but for folks who really care about the
best sound quality to go along with the
optional pop filter which reduces
plosives they've got an optional
suspension mounted seseri that'll work
with third-party stands
alright so Linus you mentioned sound
quality are you gonna talk about that at
some point yes yes I will it's coming
but first let me finish up with the mic
body on the bottom you'll find the mini
B USB input a threaded socket for
third-party stands or the optional pop
filter a headphone jack that offers zero
latency monitoring something that's
great for live broadcasters and a toggle
for the eliminated Razer logo on the
back on the back under that logo are two
dials one for the microphone gain
control and the other to alter the
pickup pattern of the three fourteen
millimeter condenser capsules hidden
under the mesh at the top of the mic the
options are bi-directional cardioid
omnidirectional and stereo and if you're
not familiar with any of that
terminology razer includes a handy
little glossary in their manual that
tells you the best pickup pattern for
some of the most common applications on
the front of the mic is a mute button
the monitoring output volume control
dial and an OLED screen that displays
volume and gain levels according to
whatever has been most recently adjusted
but now that we've talked for four
minutes about what the siren is supposed
to be and the box it comes in it's time
to answer the real question is it
actually any good the answer is yes it's
good really good even ah but I was
expecting a little bit better not
because the siren is until well built
and likely very worthy upgrade to the
audio recording solution you're using
now but because of the design philosophy
of this product razer aimed to create a
jack-of-all-trades mic here with the
adjustable pickup patterns and while its
versatility is outstanding i feel like
most of the use cases they present for
anything but the cardioid configuration
are unlikely uses for this product i
mean no
one will be using it for instrumental
recording conference calls and events I
mean what does that even mean why would
I want a microphone picking up literally
everything around it in the middle of an
event and if you're conducting
interviews you need to mic up each
person rather than relying on one mic to
capture everything if you want to do
things even remotely properly so because
of that I wish that Razer had delivered
a more specialized product the best
cardioid mic baked could build for
streaming and voice recording rather
than a do everything product because I
think it might have been a little better
at what I think most people are going to
use it for in that case now I don't have
a ton of quality microphones to compare
it against unfortunately so I could only
really compare directly to the editors
Keys SL 300 a very similarly priced
cardioid only mic but I personally think
sounds significantly better close up
with that great AM radio sound and from
a distance with much better background
noise isolation and I guess I can also
compare it to the built-in mic on my
audio technica ath AG ones it's not a
desktop microphone but it's the best on
headset mic I've yet encountered and for
game streamers anyway it's certainly a
viable option so you guys can hear test
recordings of a bunch of different
configurations in the SoundCloud link
below but for the time being here's a
couple recordings of the siren at least
all razer siren test recordings were
done with the cardioid pickup pattern
unless otherwise noted my first
recording here is a best-case scenario
with the siren between my keyboard and
body with a double layer pop filter note
the significant background noise from
other computers in the office and the
sound level of typing on the keyboard
that's directly behind the computer for
reference here's a recording of the
siren without the pop filter in the same
position this recording was done with
the SL 300 microphone in the same
configuration basically a best-case
scenario for this mic background noise
is lower if you listen and here is what
background typing sounds like
and finally here's the siren positioned
off to the side of my monitor less ideal
for audio quality but perhaps more
convenient for folks who don't want
their microphone in the way and now for
fun I'm going to switch modes
here's omnidirectional with all the
background noise in the room and it's
full glory
and here's stereo with me leaning a
little bit to the left and now a little
bit to the right
so in conclusion while I've rag Don
Racer a little bit for the sound of the
mic I do have to give credit where
credit is due it's a lot better than
what most people are using and the
versatility is better than both of the
other two products that I was able to
compare it against while the SL 300 has
a minus 10 DB switch and a low-pass
filter
it doesn't come with on mic control
knobs a stand or much more importantly a
zero latency real-time monitoring jack
and the a tha g1 headset mic is well
aside from being expensive attached to a
headset something that not everyone
wants to be stuck with so I guess at the
end of all this the siren ekes out a
recommendation not because razors naming
scheme is getting any better I mean
really guys it looks like you just
misspelled the product name but because
the mic looks like a solid bet to me
right now but then again who knows how
I'll feel when blue sends over their
competitor so stay tuned for that review
but before we can do any of that a word
from our one of our most fun sponsors
cheero
now normal Ichiro is promoting some kind
of awesome deal on one of their portable
battery banks or something like that but
you guys have bought so many of these so
far that they figured they'd offer an
adorable accessory to go with what
you've already got this time this is the
danboard USB cable the concept here not
exactly groundbreaking you use it to
charge or sync your Android phone or
tablet or anything else that uses a
microUSB connector but the difference is
that it's got an adorable little Dan
board themed design that includes
light-up eyes on the a type connector
end and the pricing is very reasonable
for a designer USB cable at around 10
bucks
for up to a 3-foot length a neat little
gift idea and they didn't send us a
of these unfortunately ger but their
five pack of flexible magnetic cable
clips are a solid little add-on for any
cable management enthusiast and can be
used to store money or other loose
papers as well so thanks cheerio for
