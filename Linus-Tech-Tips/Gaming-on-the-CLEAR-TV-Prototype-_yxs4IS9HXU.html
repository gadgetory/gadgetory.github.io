that I haven't seen before on a show
floor and a hotel suite well I mean
except for that but they won't take the
veil off that so I won't be seeing that
today which means I'm not seeing
anything new today so then you might be
wondering well gee Linus why the heck
did you fly all the way to South Korea
to make this video and the answer is
that unlike in a controlled show floor
environment today I get to go hands-on
like literally hands-on with a prototype
transparent OLED from LG Display
including running my own content on it
so if you guys were thinking there's no
way he's gonna hook a PC up to it in
game on it well you're clearly new to
this channel
so they were a little cagey about how
much detail I can give you guys about
how it actually works
transparent OLED is still very much a
developing technology but one of the key
benefits of getting off the show floor
and into the factory is that I got a
chance to sit down with one of the
engineers who actually worked on the
prototype display that we will be
playing with and between mr. sook and
the rest of the team here I was able to
gain a lot of insights here's a thing
transparent displays are honestly
nothing new in fact if you have a
fancy-pants store and you're willing to
pay the premium you can already get them
installed in your windows which allows
you to have your you know product
display and communicate a lot more
information about it then you would
normally be able to - so the demo that
they're running here is pretty typical
of how they'd expect transparent
displays to be deployed in the real
world but the key difference between a
transparent OLED and a transparent LCD
is how clear they can make the portions
of the display that are off and I
actually can't tell from back here it's
like it's trippy I can kind of see like
a ghost of the image from back here I
can't tell which parts you guys can see
through or not so here's the thing
LCDs partly because they have a separate
backlight have more layers that are
required for them to display an image
and they also require more circuitry to
drive them which obviously gets in the
way of light passing through them so at
this time you could expect about 10
percent transparency out of an LCD
display by contrast OLED only really
requires the OLED pixel sheet which if
you're familiar with the technology
emits its own light and the circuitry
that connects all of the pixels together
so the thin film transistors or TFT none
of the other optical sheets are actually
needed so when I asked mr. sook to tell
me about one challenge and
creating a transparent OLED he laughed
and then his answer was immediate he
said one of the biggest challenges in
achieving this level of transparency was
figuring out how to align the circuitry
that drives the pixels behind the self
emissive pixels that way you can make
much better use of the available space
for transparency so to better understand
that how a transparent display works I
ask then well what exactly is the
difference between the OLED pixel sheet
and the transparent display and then the
one that would be in your normal OLED TV
at home and apparently it's pretty
negligible so my follow-up question of
course then was if I took my TV from
home you know off the wall and started
peeling layers off the back of it could
I make it transparent I mean if you've
ever tried this with an LCD you'll know
that it actually kind of works that's
how I buy power does those trippy side
panels on some of their computers and
the answer was unfortunately no to make
it clear pardon the pun it's not so much
that they leave out the back opaque
layer and it's more like that they punch
thousands of holes through the entire
displace now it's time for the fun stuff
so I ended up with one of the heaviest
bags that I have ever taken on a trip
the thing about these kinds of like demo
grade displays is you're never really
sure what exactly is behind the curtain
or under the cabinet you don't know you
know what it takes to drive them so I
came equipped with everything that I
could possibly think of but I think
given how straightforward this one ended
up being honestly we could use either so
we could use our xbox one or I actually
brought a full fledged gaming PC
equipped with a GTX 20 ATT I tell you
what why don't you guys leave a comment
below letting me know which one you
think I should use I'm just kidding by
the time I read your comments I'll have
made the decision like
ages ago so we're gonna go with the
gaming PC alright so they actually pre
hooked us up an HDMI cable that plugs
into just sort of this grey box here
alright so we can go ahead and hook
after that and also I think we can
probably get our our jewelry display out
what do you think Dennis does this suit
me
dazzling thank you you know what I'm
gonna wear it for the rest of the video
yeah what do you think this is a good
look for me
you know while we were shooting this
Dennis asked me hey do you think that
stuff's real alright so we're almost
ready to fire it up but first I got to
figure out how to use the LG factory SVC
remote con look at this thing like what
is HDMI hot USB hot it's got all kinds
of stuff on it Hey look at that okay
looks just like a normal one so let's go
ahead and turn on our gaming PC hey I
was easy wow this looks ridiculous
Dennis you told me I looked dazzling I
know someone told me I look dazzling you
can see through it but like just barely
cuz it's sold it's so bright like it's
basically the same as an OLED TV look at
that it's that crazy like can you see
that and then as soon as I go over here
it's like boom window or should I say
Windows cuz it's a Windows window wait
it no this is so weird
it's like the game is floating in the
air like from your from your angle can
you so have you seen how much you can
see through it from behind like you can
actually see right through it from the
back as well oh yeah yeah like the game
is running here come around come on go
cut like that's what's on the screen
right now and then if you go around
behind it's like basically completely
clear
it's not the trickiest thing about this
is that even when the image is
relatively bright like what we're
looking at right now it's really about
where your eyes focus that determines
sort of what you can see and what you
can't see like when I'm focused on the
image in front of me I can barely even
tell that it's clear but if I look
behind it where obviously my game goes
out of focus like I can see what's
behind it I mean this opens up so many
possibilities for changing the viewers
experience like obviously it's not the
kind of thing that would be applicable
to movies or I mean even gaming we're
just fooling around right now but for
signage or for you know custom
experiences it's really cool you know
what we should do I should try and play
from the back like I can only kind of
see a ghost of the image remember how
the challenge here was getting the
electronics aligned with the self
omitting pixels right I mean looking at
how thin this is like this bezel is
nothing to do with how thin the actual
glass is like would it even would it be
possible to create one that works on
both sides where you could actually you
know you could turn it clear like
imagine that as a head-to-head gaming
experience right where you've got one
person playing on one side you've got
one person playing on the other side and
then you know after the match is over
you can you can see each other or if you
focused hard enough like past the glass
you could like you could see the other
player you couldn't see what they're
doing cuz like I can barely make out
what's on the other side of the display
but like that the possibilities are just
kind of endless right oh okay I think
part of the problem is that I'm trying
to go left and I'm going right yeah I
got no idea what's going on
this was a better idea on paper ah yes
well that is significantly better
knowing how its assembled
I shouldn't be that surprised but I
still am by the the vibrancy of the
color and the brightness of the image
like you think about you know it's a
clear display like you wouldn't really
expect that but honestly I think the
only thing really preventing this from
looking like a normal OLED TV right now
is that the wall behind us is kind of
gray actually new idea so LG says they
can kill the lights in here and we can
just unplug these things okay do you
guys want to go ahead and do that so
this should give us an idea of what this
would look like with a much more black
background nice oh that's crazy look at
this so even the parts where we've got
the gray and white background you can
barely see it like can you see me right
now
that's crazy
so like imagine this what if you could
have a TV that may be used like a
secondary layer something like some kind
of polarization filter or like I don't
even know where you could convert
between transparent and opaque you could
easily convince me that this is just a
TV so theoretically the closer you get
the easier should be to see through like
us like a screen door but in practice
actually I find it a closer I get the
more the brightness of the of the oh
let's just kind of overwhelms my eyes
like I can't actually see through it
like can you see me at all no I'm waving
for me the exciting thing here is just
as this continues to develop like what
kinds of possibilities we're gonna
unlock I mean even things that have been
imagined already like smart mirrors for
example are we better off with a two-way
mirror in front of a conventional
display or you know what if we did have
a transparent display over top of a
conventional reflective back I don't
know I mean let me know
in the comments below what you guys
foresee for a technology like this in
the future and while you guys are down
below by the way you can check out LG's
dedicated site to oled technology so
they're gonna have information about all
Ed's content about all Ed's articles
that are written about OLED technology I
think right now it's Korean only but I
believe they're gonna have an English
version coming sometime in the near
future so guys you can check that out
below and that's I honestly pretty much
it for the video today if you guys
disliked it you can hit that button but
if you liked it hit like get subscribed
or maybe consider checking out where to
buy the stuff we featured at the link in
the tum just kidding you can't buy one
of these yet but but later later
it's it's gonna happen it's gonna happen
while you're down there you can check
out our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
