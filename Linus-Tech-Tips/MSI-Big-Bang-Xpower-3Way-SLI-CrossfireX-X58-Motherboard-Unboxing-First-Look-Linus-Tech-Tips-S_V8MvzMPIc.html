quite a few requests unbox this is the
MSI big bang xpower and this is part of
the refresh of x58 boards that we've
seen over the last couple months so most
of the major manufacturers are taking
their old x58 designs and they're
updating them so one of the first
features that we can talk about what
this board is that it has USB 3.1 or
boards it also has say 26 gigabit per
second so these are two important
features that a lot of the motherboard
manufacturers have felt is necessary to
redesign their boards for so let's talk
about some of the msi exclusive features
first of all this is military class that
means they're using only top quality
components including IC chokes which are
a newer generation ferrite core with up
to 20 degree lower temperature stable
power supply and higher power efficiency
they're also using their high conductive
polymerised capacitors up to eight times
longer lifetime and they have a rare
highly stable tantalum core mmm
self-repair ability okay this I was not
aware of but apparently they can repair
themselves it also has solid capacitors
so up to a 10 year lifetime under full
load and then this is kind of
interesting so they say for gaming up to
12 years and for office up to 40 years
but basically they're saying 10 years
assuming you're running this 24 7 and
they will not explode I think what they
mean is leaked so no explosion is
guaranteed on this particular
motherboard so let's move a little bit
further down we have eax advanced HD
support as well as THX certification on
this particular audio solution so it's
their quantum wave gaming audio card
it's still onboard audio but it is on a
riser card so you will get a little bit
less electrical interference if you are
using the analog outputs it supports up
to 3-way SLI as well as 3-way crossfire
so you can see they've got it demoed
here with a three-way crossfire
configuration and as I already said
before USB 3.0 and say 26 gigabit per
second let's move around to the back
where they're talking about a couple
other features so you've got dr. Moss
three and one server grade MOSFETs here
you can look at that four hundred
percent faster than a traditional MOSFET
so that means in terms of the switching
speed and they're saying that one phase
of dr. Moss is more efficient than a 4k
phase traditional MOSFET now something
that I've actually noticed is there are
some other motherboards not made by msi
that have actually switched over on the
very high end from other method board
manufacturers to using a dr. Moss style
MOSFET they don't call it out as dr.
Moss because that's MSI's marketing name
for it but they have started to make
that switch so here is a quick guide for
the big bang xpower shows us all the
features of the board but we have a real
board to look at so we're not going to
bother with that and let's have a look
at the accessory package which is
absolutely huge I don't even know where
to start with this okay well first thing
we've got our V check V check things so
you can plug these into your motherboard
and then you can check voltages using a
multimeter that's a great feature to
have on an enthusiast grade board next
we have their front panel connectors so
you can plug all the stuff you need into
these and then plug them directly into
the board in one chunk if you have thick
fingers and you have trouble with that
fine work we've got a couple say 26
gigabit per second ports as well as a
molex to SATA power adapter we have one
very long SLI bridge and what else do
you have okay these two are SLI so two
shorter SLI bridges and then one
crossfire bridge and that's a long one
okay then next we have to say two to
three gigabit per second cables as well
as a molex to SATA power adapter and
then another pack of that next we have a
backplane adapter and this I like to see
they've got black SATA cables connected
to it i've seen these in the past
included with motherboards but they're
always red and if you have like a nice
color coordinated build you don't want
to use red cables necessarily we've got
to e SATA ports as well as a power port
and then they've included a molex power
to to say to power adapter so this is as
well as one east SATA cable so this is
basically for using bear drives hooked
up directly for the back of your pc just
as like a cheap way to add more storage
next we've got two USB 2.0 ports on
I owe plate we have a motherboard user
guide this is the Europe version it is
English German Russian and French okay
shows you how to install your CPU tells
you all about oh this is this is
interesting we're going to need this for
later i'm really glad i happen to cross
that note we're going to talk about it
later so we've got a drivers and
utilities DVD throw it away we have a
quantum wave driver throw it away
download the latest ones they're hard
drive backup utility we've also got it
was interesting whoo this is for the OC
dashboard okay we'll have a closer look
at that in a minute as well so much
stuff in here quick installation guide
msi winky user guide msi overclocking
guide look at that they include an
overclocking guide no way so they talk
about OC genie a multi graphics card
gaming design huh well here they talk a
lot more about the technologies that are
involved in in producing a top
overclocking board that's really cool
I've never seen something like this
before usually this is the kind of
marketing materials you see before you
buy it but they actually want to help
you really understand this particular
board look at this they've got indicator
lights for how many CPU phases are
active because under low load it's
actually more efficient to have fewer
cpu power phases but under high load you
need more in order to deliver stable
power so they actually dynamically
adjust how many phases are running and
then they give you a little indicator to
tell you how many that is very cool
super pipe that's another thing i forgot
to talk about okay fine cameraman wants
to move them okay then we have the
user's guide which is in more in-depth
shows you a bunch of the bios features
finally we have the OC dashboard okay so
let's have a look at the all the stuff
about this so the OC dashboard panel so
that plugs into your motherboard and
then you have a little USB connector
here so take the OC dashboard through
the i/o shield connect it to that
motherboard court okay what does it do
though that's what I want to know okay
so this gives you bios postcodes so if
there's some kind of a problem this will
give you a code on here to tell you what
exactly is the problem it does have
an LCD display on it so you can see that
you can adjust a whole bunch of system
settings including things like your CPU
voltage you can adjust your other
voltages DDR voltage you can adjust you
can use direct OC mode in order to just
directly turn up the cpu frequency so
that's something that I can imagine a
lot of people using and last but not
least it also displays some interesting
system information such as CPU
temperatures and other things like that
and there's more there's still more so
including creative alchemy as well as
the ax five-point oh this is there
included onboard sound card so it has
optical as well as coaxial audio out and
7.1 analog audio out and there's still
more there still more in here look at
this I have never ever seen an accessory
package this complete with anything
never mind the motherboard so here's the
USB cable for the OC dashboard and here
is the the other cable for the OC
dashboard so that's the one that plugs
it in right through the back of the i/o
shield which finally we have arrived at
how long I wonder how long this unboxing
is already took me like five minutes
just to get through the accessories okay
let's have a look at the motherboard
itself finally so this is a premium x58
board that means are going to find all
of the bells and whistles so the
superpipe here that's an eight
millimeter heat pipe that goes all the
way around from all of the MOSFET
coolers and then down to the Northbridge
you're going to find an LGA 1366 socket
this is a loads socket so you don't have
to worry about any of that scare stuff
that was going around with poor contact
between the CPU and the pins inside
we've got not one but two 8-pin power
connectors up in their ideal location on
the top left of the board okay you can
plug in to four pins by the look of
things but I really would recommend with
the board like this either a single 8
pin or if you have to plug in both we've
got the easy installation Ram slots so
you can see that there are clips only on
the one side so you basically just slide
the module in
clip it from the one side and you're
done in theory that saves a little work
but I think it's more to do with the
fact that the clips here can sometimes
bump up against the back of a graphics
card installed in the top pcie slot so
that really conveniences you that way
okay I don't think conveniences you is
actually a valid thing to say that here
we go sixteen phases of CPU power with
indicator LEDs up here showing you how
many are actually active at any given
time these memory slots do support
triple channel memory so you're going to
want to populate the black ones first
and then the blue ones as for all x 58
boards out there on the market tremor
man's wandering around he's looking at
the Southbridge but I want to show you
the 24 pin power connector is in its
ideal location on the right-hand edge of
the board and then we've got a nice big
southbridge heatsink here and I think
the reason that they put such a big
cooler because the Southbridge doesn't
need a lot of cooling is because you can
install so many graphics cards in this
motherboard so if you've got this all
filled up you're going to need a fair
bit of cooling down here in order to
keep that at a safe operating
temperature because graphics cards do
kick out a lot of heat down here we've
got six say two to three gigabit per
second ports as well as to say 236
gigabit per second ports we've got our V
checkpoints for a CPU qpi DC DD r io h
IC h and a ground connection next we've
got a couple of these switches so these
are actually hardware voltage switches i
believe and then we've got a couple of
front USB headers this is a feature I
love these are touch sensitive buttons
so you've got power reset o see Jeanie
as well as the direct front side bus or
rather I should say base clock
adjustment buttons here you've got front
firewire and then this is a pretty
killer feature of this board you've got
six pci express 16x slot but there is a
bit of a catch so here in the manual i
found the page that tells you how to
install your graphics cards now we will
not all run at pci express 16x at the
same time so make sure you follow these
guides in order to get the fastest speed
possible because
if you populate one card you're getting
16 x 2 cards 16 x if you populate three
cards you're getting 16 16 8 if you do
four cards you're getting eight eight
eight if you do five cards I believe one
of them scales down to 4x and if you're
doing six cards I believe two of them
scale down to 4x although I could be
mistaken about the exact particular yeah
here we go so if you have six lanes
install six expansion cards you're
running at 84 4844 okay so there I was
actually mistaken quite a few of them
will scale down to 4x now it should be
noted that 8x is not going to impact
performance in anything but a synthetic
benchmark so you can do up to four cards
at 8x and then 4x actually for most
cards on the market will not have a
negative performance impact if you are
installing six graphics cards make sure
you do plug into the supplemental PCI
Express 6 pin power connector here
that's to make sure that your graphics
cards do get enough power because none
of these other ports are going to be
able to provide enough power through the
motherboard for that many video cards
last but not least we're moving around
to the back of the board where we've got
2 ps2 ports very happy to see that we
have AC most clear port we have their OC
tool plug in here then we have firewire
six USB 2.0 ports 1 e SATA port two
gigabit ethernet ports and two USB 3.0
ports thank you for checking out my long
long unboxing of the msi big bang xpower
motherboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
