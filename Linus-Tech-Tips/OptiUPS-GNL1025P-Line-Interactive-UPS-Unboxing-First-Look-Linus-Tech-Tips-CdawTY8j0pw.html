a line interactive ups from op to UPS I
we had a look at a couple UPS's from
them including the beastly one from
they're durable series which was loud
but beastly more for industrial use as
well as one of the more consumer ones
this guy right here is a higher end
consumer level unit so it has some of
the features that you'd expect from a
premium UPS like being lined interactive
and almost playing what that is in a
moment but it doesn't have like an
industrial cooling fan going on or you
know other things that would make it not
really appropriate for home or office
use it's also quite a bit smaller and
less heavy than that one that we were
dealing with to go for so let's see what
opti has to say for themselves on the
box here this is the 1025 p which means
it's good for up to six hundred and
fifteen wats line interactive what does
that mean line interactive means that if
you have crappy power going into the UPS
even when it's not running off of
battery it will be adjusting and fixing
the input voltage for you so that your
computer or whatever other devices you
have hooked up to it are never going to
see ugly dirty power that n over the
long term or even the short term damage
your components and cause instability
line interactive is a must if you have a
high-end system and you want to take
care of it this one right here simulated
sine wave so yes it is not true sine
wave or pure sine wave or whatever else
the case may be however that doesn't
necessarily mean that every active power
factor correction power supply is going
to just turn off we actually did a fair
amount of testing on this with a
simulated sine wave ups in the past
versus a pure sine wave ups may actually
found that the pure sine wave ups we had
which is from not get off to UPS but one
of the competitors who shall remain
nameless was less compatible with active
PFC power supplies than the simulated
one so it's not as cut and dried as
simulated sine wave is bad and Pierce on
good so bear that in mind okay read
reviews would probably be the best thing
that's advice I can get rain it out full
rated output made a boo-boo the input
voltage range with the rated voltage
plus or minus twenty five percent so if
your power is like super dirty and it's
like a hundred volts or 140 volts input
it'll still be able to fix that for you
no problem okay output voltage
regulation plus or minus five percent on
battery that's just fine i mean
batteries batteries tough transfer times
four milliseconds sort of battery yes i
will restart yes it does communicate
with your computer so you can use USB in
order to there we go to get it to tell
your computer hey you know there's no
power you're gonna want to shut that
down there and shut down properly buddy
or uh no bad things are gonna happen
that's basically what it says but like
in binary ah AVR implicated hmmmm cool
it up to the gap for battery backup to
bypass outlets okay UPS shuts down at
110% load versus seconds one hundreds of
okay overload protection few circuit
breaker so overload protection basically
650 watts is good enough for your it's
okay remember guys if your computer
consumes 500 watts that means this guy
hostile put about 600 watts to sustain
it because of the inefficiency again at
the power supply level so basically this
is good for your single tower with one
high-end cpu1 high-end GPU this is not
for like sli or triple SLI
configurations or anything like that
especially if you're claiming you have
something like your monitor connected to
it as well and you got like a lot of
peripherals plugged into your board so
bear in mind this is for like you know
your basic gaming system and not much
else they do have much higher in units
including from this series they have one
that can do up to 900 watts that guy you
can do an SLI system no problem and then
you know probably your monitor as well
and I wouldn't worry too much about it
so it's heavy you know then batteries
are heavy and that's pretty typical of
UPS you've also got an LED readout on
this one which on that lower end unit we
didn't see so this gives you a lot of
useful information including of a
battery level as well as what mode the
UPS is
running in or in what mode the UPS is
running I should be making an effort to
speak correctly on this channel since
you know maybe I'll start minus like
English language tips at some point on
the back you got your input you have for
battery backup and surge protected and
actively you know taking care of outputs
and then to simple pass throughs just
sort of protection no battery backup
you've also got Ethernet protection or
you can actually plug in rj11 which we
would be your phone line so you can
protect those as well and there's your
USB interface whoops I turned it on
ventilation is handled by vents in the
side no active cooling on this guy so
it's going to be pretty much silent you
might get a slight buzz because there's
some pretty high-powered stuff going on
inside of ups's and I'm just going to
check my notes really quick here just
blatantly looking at my cheat sheet
while slick pretends it's not happening
by looking somewhere else jujitsu in the
book and yeah I think we pretty much
covered everything oh yeah except the
included phone cable and USB cable and
Sentinel software which you can download
the latest on the opti UPS website and I
think that pretty much it thank you for
checking out my unboxing the first look
and don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from our boxing degrees and
other computer videos and don't forget
if you have a computer you care about
you pretty much should be running it off
of a UPS it's not actually that optional
there's a couple of things here you
might want to know battery mode will
sound every 10 seconds low battery will
sound every second and overload will
sound every point five seconds so you
can tell what the alarm means just by
listening to it you guys have seen the
Fawlty Towers episode then just remember
it's a semitone higher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
