the fractal design Tesla r2 series of
power supplies we've only got one here
today this is the thousand watt but
these are 80 plus gold value proper
supplies it's sort of an interesting
position to be in because they're highly
efficient but you won't find some of the
bells and whistles that you find on
their more high-end units the Newton
power supplies so those ones are a B+
platinum and are just generally sort of
better you know longer warranty all that
kind of stuff but maybe plus gold is
still pretty good and there's a lot to
be said for just you know a generally
well-built non-modular 80 plus gold
power supply so three-year warranty SLI
and crossfire certified which is sort of
interesting just because those
certifications do cost do cost money you
plus gold certified efficiency ok silent
temperature controlled 135 millimeter
fan doesn't ramp up flat past 40% until
it reaches sixty percent load which is
six hundred watts that will almost never
happen and doesn't really ramp up until
the last twenty percent which again
almost never happens with a thousand
watt power supply so demanding high-end
gaming machines powerful workstations
single 12 volt rail capable of providing
up to 960 watts of the total 1000 watt
output Tesla r2 has Clint DC voltage
regulation and ripples fraction they can
deliver their full rated wattage
continuously even with an intake
temperature as high as 40 degrees Wow
okay and it should almost never be in
taking 40 degree air 80 plus gold
efficiency extra long ATX cable that's
actually really handy and it's supposed
to show you know you can tell companies
that make power supplies and companies
that make cases and power supplies
because it means that they just like
they have cases there and they're like
oh we should probably try on our power
supply in the case before we like
release it and they're like whoa we
should have a longer cable see that's
the kind of things you figure out if you
actually have an ecosystem of products
that you want to go together
so we've gotta include a power connector
we've got not a fair number of included
cable ties only two velcro straps and
then four five plastic zip ties included
mounting screws and it comes in a
fractal design bag hey looks like has a
new bag to wear over its head just gonna
fit let's try no it doesn't fit that's
too bad either way you know cute little
bag you can store like you know your
Barbies in into something I'm in slicks
Barbies not
musikverein Barbies I know you guys
don't have Barbies but he does believe
it or not lots of babies he's big into
Barbies it's weird okay let's have a
look at the power supply unit itself
very clean overall design like we've
come to expect from fractal with their
cases simple fractal design snowflake on
the top simple you know safety
certifications and all that good stuff
basic specs printed right onto the power
supply no cheesy stickers here guys do
not remove this cover please please
please please please don't that's
definitely a good thing to have on the
side as well 80 plus gold efficiency
1000 watt Tesla and then we find the one
hundred and thirty-five millimeter
cooling fan so that looks like one of
there are two series fans actually which
is uh actually a good thing because
these are these are very quiet fans at
the back you find a honeycomb mesh then
the usual thing as well as power plug
and power switch now let's have a look
at what we've got in terms of connected
cables because this will make or break
any power supply let's face it it's
pretty easy to find a good power supply
these days there's lots of different
options but if you have a great power
supply that you know this guy's very low
ripple fry it's good power etc etc etc
but just doesn't have the right cable
mix for you that you're not gonna use it
ah not grates leaving on this to be
perfectly honest especially when you
consider that it's better sleeping on
their other unit as well as there's just
kind of better options out there but
again like I said this isn't a bit of a
unique position because it's an 80 plus
gold unit that is value price so you can
expect certain things that don't affect
that performance that efficiency to not
be as premium as what you might expect
from again
higher end unit so you got your 24-pin
connector you got let me find that long
eight pin that they were talking about
over here where is it that's reasonably
long that's not the longest I've seen by
any stretch of the imagination that
should be it should be good enough even
for something like a define XL which is
about as about as bad as it gets to be
perfectly honest okay and then in terms
of GPU connector we have many so we have
three harnesses each with two six plus
two pin connectors at the ends I
actually I have mixed feelings about
this approach where you've got one
connector and then another one that
comes right off of it because I don't
know I've just sometimes it looks really
good sometimes it doesn't look that
great this one actually looks alright
because it comes off pretty clean and as
long as like they orient them alright
and you can kind of tie them together
like here here okay well I'll show you
guys because this is what it will look
like actually installed on a graphics
card okay so you'll have the 1/8 pin
that goes in like this also it can be a
bit of a bear to deal with just because
all the cables are sort of wired
together although this one seems again
it seems all right that's probably a
good noise there you go so that's what
that will look like so it can be quite
it can look quite clean it comes down to
your personal tastes and it's okay you
could argue that it's a lot better than
having two separate cables running to
the video card which is totally
unnecessary because the PCIe spec has
nothing to do with how much current can
actually be carried by these copper
wires you can easily plug two of these
into into a video card without worrying
about like the wires heating up too much
or anything like that so okay six of
those again good lengths on those
nothing that brings any alarm bells or
anything so let's go ahead and get the
ones that we've looked out of the way
this is it huh I'm not a big fan of non
modular power supplies these days it is
a way to get better if
see out of out of the power supply
designed to use hard car detached cables
but okay basically if you're trying to
save a buck go for a non modular power
supply otherwise maybe look at the
Newton line okay so we got three SATA
connectors here again nice long cable on
that one that's good to see and very
nice termination in between here so
that'll look really clean no matter what
you have to do to it here we've got
another three here we've got another
three and then only a single harness
with two little X's and a floppy I
wouldn't have minded seeing two
harnesses with molex just because you
can run into situations where for
example my system has only two needed
molex connectors but they're not this
close together one of them runs off on
the back of my sound card and the other
one runs my pump which is down in sort
of the basement so this wouldn't reach I
would need an extension cable some sort
which I have in my current setup so that
I only have to have one molex molex
cable attached to my modular power
supply so I'm not saying like I can't
make do with this I'm just saying it
might be nice if you need more than that
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the Tesla r2
1000 watt 80-plus cool power supply from
fractal don't forget to subscribe for
more unboxings review than other
computer videos from fun look I usually
say thank you for watching don't forget
to subscribe for boxing fees another
yeah that's it slick noticed something I
didn't notice before these are actually
rubber isolated mounts here not screws
so that fan should be even quieter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
