the fractal design Tesla are two series
of power supplies we've only got one
here today this is the thousand watt but
these are 80 plus gold value proper
supplies just sort of an interesting
position to be in because they're highly
efficient but you won't find some of the
bells and whistles that you find on
their more high-end units the Newton
power supplies so those ones are 80 plus
platinum and are just generally sort of
better than a longer warranty all that
kind of stuff but maybe plus gold is
still pretty good and there's a lot to
be said for just you know generally
well-built non-modular 80 plus gold
power supply so three year warranty SLI
and crossfire certified which is sort of
interesting just because those
certifications do cost do cost money ah
you plus gold certified efficiency okay
silent temperature-controlled 155
millimeter fan doesn't ramp up past
forty percent until it reaches sixty
percent load which is 600 watts that
will almost never happen and doesn't
really ramp up until the last twenty
percent which again almost never happens
with a thousand watt power supply so Dan
ahana demanding high end gaming machines
powerful workstations single 12 volt
rail capable of providing up to nine
hundred and sixty watts of the total
1000 watt output to slaughter to
esculent DC voltage regulation and
ripples fraction they can deliver their
full rated wattage continuously even
with an intake temperature as high as 40
degrees Wow okay and it should almost
never be in taking 40 degree air 80 plus
gold efficiency extra long ATX cable
that's actually really handy and it
suppose to show you how you can tell
companies that make power supplies and
companies that make cases and power
supplies because it means that they just
like they have cases there they're like
oh we should probably try our power
supply in the case before we like
release it and they're like whoa we
should have a longer cable see that's
the kind of things you figure out if you
actually have an ecosystem of products
that you want to go together reason
so we've got to include a power
connector we've got not a fair number of
included cable ties only two velcro
straps and then 45 plastic zip ties
included mounting screws and it comes in
a fractal design Beck hey look slick has
a new bag to wear over his head just
gonna fit let's try oh no it doesn't fit
that's too bad either way no cute little
bag you can store like you know your
Barbies in into something I'm in slicks
Barbie it's not use avira Barbies I know
you guys don't have Barbies but he does
believe it or not lots of hobbies he's
big into parties it's weird okay let's
have a look at the power supply unit
itself very clean overall design like
we've come to expect from fractal with
their cases simple fractal design
snowflake on the top simple you know
safety certifications and all that good
stuff basic specs printed right on to
the power supply no cheesy stickers here
guys do not remove this cover please
please please please please don't that's
definitely a good thing to have on the
side as well 80 plus gold efficiency
1000 watt Tesla and then we find the one
hundred and thirty five-millimeter
cooling fence that looks like one of
there are two series fans actually which
is actually a good thing because these
are these are very quiet pens at the
back you find a honeycomb mesh the usual
thing as well as power plug and power
switch now let's have a look at what
we've got in terms of connected cables
because this will make or break any
power supply let's face it it's pretty
easy to find a good power supply these
days there's lots of different options
but if you have a great power supply
that you know this cause very low ripple
fred's good power in such words etc but
just doesn't have the right cable mix
for you that you're not going to use it
ah not great sleeving on this to be
perfectly honest especially when you
consider that it's better sleeping on
their other unit as well as there's just
kind of better options out there but
again like I said this isn't a bit of a
unique position because it's an 80 plus
gold unit that is value price so you can
expect certain things that don't affect
that performance that efficiency to not
be as premium as what you might expect
from
higher end unit so you got your 24-pin
connector you got let me find that long
8 pin that they were talking about over
here and where is it it is okay that's
reasonably long that's not the longest
I've seen by any stretch of the
imagination but should be it should be
good enough even for something like a
define XL which is about as about as bad
as it gets to be perfectly honest okay
and then in terms of GPU connector we
have many so we have three harnesses
each with 26 plus two pin connectors at
the ends I actually I have mixed
feelings about this approach where
you've got one connector and then
another one that comes right off of it
because I don't know I've just sometimes
it looks really good sometimes it
doesn't look that great this one
actually looks alright because it comes
off pretty clean and as long as like
they orient them all right and you can
kind of tie them together like here here
okay well I'll show you guys because
this is what it will look like actually
installed on a graphics card okay so
you'll have the 18 pin that goes on like
this I'll so it can be a bit of a bear
to deal with just because all the cables
are sort of wired together although this
one seems again it seems alright that's
probably a good noise there you go so
that's what that will look like so it
can be quite you can look quite clean it
comes down to your personal tastes and
it's okay you could argue that it's a
lot better than having two separate
cables running to the video card which
is totally unnecessary because the PCIe
spec has nothing to do with how much
current can actually be carried by these
copper wires you can easily plug to
these into into a video card without
worrying about like the wires heating up
too much or anything like that so okay
six of those again good lengths on those
nothing that brings any alarm bells or
anything so let's go ahead and get the
ones that we've looked out of the way
this is it half I'm not a big fan of
non-modular power supplies these days it
is a way to get better efficiency out of
out of the power supply designed to use
hard hard attached cables but okay
basically if you're trying to save a
black go for non modular power supply
otherwise maybe look at the new online
okay so we got three SATA connectors
here again nice long cable on that one
that's good to see in very nice
termination in between here so that'll
look really clean no matter what you
have to do to it here we've got another
three here we've got another three and
then only a single harness with two
little X's and a floppy I wouldn't have
minded seeing two harnesses with molex
just because you can run into situations
where for example my system has only two
needed molex connectors but they're not
this close together one of them runs off
on the back of my sound card and the
other one runs my pump which is down in
sort of the basement so this wouldn't
reach I would need an extension cable
some sort which I have in my current
setup so that I only have to have one
molex slaw molex cable attached to my
modular power supply so I'm not saying
like I can't make do with this I'm just
saying it might be nice if you need more
than that so thank you for checking out
my unboxing your first look at the Tesla
or to 1000 watt 80 plus gold power
supply from fractal don't forget to
subscribe for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos from fun what I
usually say thank you for watching don't
forget to subscribe for more boxing
degrees another yeah that's it let's
lick notice something I didn't notice
before these are actually rubber
isolated mounts here not screws so that
fan should be even quieter</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
