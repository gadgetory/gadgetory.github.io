unboxing request that I've ever received
this is for the coolermaster sickle flow
I think they're called the r4 Series fan
so I have the blue one as well as the
green LED one I'm going to start by
unboxing the green one although you can
see pretty much what its gonna look like
now and looks like this packaging is
completely sealed they come in I'm
breaking everything they come in two
completely different packages despite
the fact that they are the same product
except a different color and I'm not
really sure why that is but they do but
anyway yeah so someone sent a message to
my employer of all people to ask me to
do this unboxing so he's sort of sending
he forwards me this email and he's like
Oh Linus someone wants you to do this
and I'm like oh okay
I mean you could always just send me a
message on YouTube it's a much faster
way to get in touch with me but either
way yeah here you go
for whoever requested this unboxing I'm
unboxing the fan you can see that it has
one two three four five six nine blades
and they're kind of a unique swept shape
I'm guessing that's why it's called
sickle flow on the back you can see that
we've got our three pins for deep our
ground and rpm monitoring and then
separately around this side you can see
the black and green ones that are
powering all of the LEDs it's got kind
of a unique construction it looks like
you could almost take this apart and put
in different LEDs if you really wanted
to like they're not just glued in there
actually they have little housings that
they sit in okay well here why don't we
plug it in they run at 2,000 rpm and
I'll show you the specs in a minute oh I
unplugged my power supply no here's a
tech tip for you if you short out the
green and the black pins on your power
supply it'll run even without plugging
it into a computer see it's on so I'll
plug my fan in here and it is green look
at that how surprising so it has a black
frame black clear blades that's the word
I was looking for not fans blades and
the cameraman is pointing us something I
have no idea what he wants he wants me
to hold it here okay let me see how
quiet it is
okay it's about what you would expect
for a 2000 rpm fan but it looks pretty
cool so I'll leave that there and then
I'll work on unboxing the other one so
this is the blue version it looks
basically the same except blue and go oh
yeah I should probably also show you the
specs here cameraman comes stare at the
specs for minutes okay so uh dude
they're there okay oh I did that thing
again everyone gives me a hard time
about it when I'm in the middle of
unboxing and I'd like make that weird I
did this it's it's it's it's it you know
what maybe I'll just do it just to spite
everybody dicta to did Tiffany okay here
let's plug in the blue one oh yeah yeah
yeah here go look at the specs while I
plug in the blue so the blue one looks
much the same except blue I think I like
the green one better but I always like
green better than blue anyway so it's
exactly the same fan you got your shiny
plastic you got your shiny LEDs and here
you can see it blowing the post-it note
no no other angle see see it blows the
post-it note pretty good so thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the
Corsair r4 series fans and I hope you've
enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips and also don't forget to
check out my other channel NCIX comm so
this is for a couple of reasons first of
all I called these Corsair fans they're
coolermaster that was a mistake and
second of all I wanted to show them
together in the dark this is under my
desk so I'm kind of camping here and
this is what they look like they look a
lot more impressive from the front than
from the back so I would recommend using
them as like an intake fan on your case
and yeah those look pretty sweet
that was it don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
