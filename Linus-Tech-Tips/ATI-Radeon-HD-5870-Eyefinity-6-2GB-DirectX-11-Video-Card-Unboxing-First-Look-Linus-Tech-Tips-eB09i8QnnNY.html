rather an unbagging a product that is
available at retail but not in this
particular form so this is the okay you
know what I'm not going to tell you what
it is and Oh hold on I need to get my
knight here because you know this knife
has proven very popular with my viewers
gonna break the elastic there yeah there
we go
we'll use that out the size size
comparison against the video card so
based on the accessory the one accessory
that came with this sample card I'm
going to let our viewers guess so pause
the video and see if you can guess what
card this is so it includes six mini
DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapters okay
so go ahead pause the video put down a
comment and guess anyway so for those
who guessed are for those who haven't
guessed yes this is the ATI Radeon HD
5870 Eyefinity six Edition so this has
six display outputs and other than that
it is pretty much a plain
Radeon 58 70 but a couple of things
first of all because it has six mini
display ports and you can actually plug
them in just like that okay it also has
a full-length exhaust slot unlike the
regular 5870 which is only able to
exhaust off about a quarter of the pci
backplate now another advantage that it
has is that it has two gigs a video ram
versus the only one giga video ram on
the regular 5870 other than that it's
pretty similar so you can see we've got
our back plate here and we've got a full
shroud on the back that's cooling let's
cooling the back of the video card we've
got a regular PCI Express 16x interface
up at the top we will find two crossfire
bridge och fingers but you know what
this is something there's a lot of
misconceptions about and I thought I'd
just clear this up a lot of people think
you have to plug two bridges if you've
only got two cards but actually that can
degrade performance rather than helping
performance is actually just fine to run
only a single bridge between your two
cards so there you go crossfire less
than
of the day so around the front of the
card we find the ATI Radeon branding and
here's another big difference is that
this card uses a six pin and an eight
pin PCI Express power connector so
because it's got those that extra RAM
that's the only real spec difference and
it needs a little bit more power okay so
we'll go around to the batmobile asked
shape of the cooler because this is a
sample card and not actually a retail
card there's only the ATI branding on it
so there's no no partner branding like a
sapphire power color XFX
nothing like that around the bottom of
the card we find nothing all that
exceptional now I just want to talk a
little bit about the Eyefinity six card
and the technology that goes behind it
so you can see that ATI is gone and
included six mini DisplayPort to
DisplayPort adapters and while I'm
talking I'm just going to plug these in
so that you can get the full impact of
all of the displays you can hook up to
this card I mean even a couple years ago
the idea of having a consumer level
gaming card that could output three
displays was crazy and now we have one
that can output to six displays now you
you might go oh well I don't have a
display port monitor and that may be
true but the reality is once you've gone
out to DisplayPort you can actually take
two of these and you can adapt them to
either HDMI or DVI so you can run six
monitors off of this card with two DVI
adapters and then four DisplayPort
monitors so that would give you a way to
do that now - 86 you can make the
argument again that a 58 70 isn't really
powerful enough to drive six displays at
2560 by 1600 resolution that would
probably be true but what you can do is
you can still run six displays out in
crossfire mode with another Eyefinity
six Edition card so that means that you
can actually run six displays off two
cards and get the power of both cards
running behind it I don't believe it
this time you can crossfire a 58 70 -
eighty six with a regular 58 70 and the
reason for that is the different video
real they may update that in the future
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and quick product showcase of
the ATI Radeon 5870 eyefinity 6 ya the
cameraman reminded me when I said thank
you for watching my video blog or
whatever it is I said that I never
actually did the size comparison that I
promised so here it is plugged into a
really old fail motherboard but it is a
standard ATX board so you can see that
it does stretch about an inch past the
edge of the board ok so you can kind of
look at that from the bottom see how far
it stretches out you can see what it
looks like installed in the motherboard
so it takes up both the PCI Express slot
it's plugged into as well as the next
over slot and then here it is for size
comparison against the camera man's
iPhone because we so frequently do that
you can see that it is much smaller than
an orb much smaller much bigger than an
iPhone there you go as helpful as that
may be and then last but not least
comparison is against the length of the
sword that I have begun using for my
unboxings so there that is it that is
the scale of the iPhone 86 58 72 gig
