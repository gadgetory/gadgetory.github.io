RGB water cooling fittings I guess some
men really do just want to watch the
world burn don't they but if you're the
type of person who wishes this RGB trend
would just please go away already
the type of person who will keep wearing
black until they invent something that's
darker well then you you're in luck my
nerdy Nick defile friend because today
we are wiping the RGB Glee right off of
a perfectly good rainbow rig and
replacing it with the blackest black you
can get in a can
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description for maximum
satisfaction we thought we'd start out
with a build that's not very black at
all for our case we chose the aptly
named fantex Eclipse p400 tempered glass
glacier white and for the internals well
if you remember our RGB build guide
whose glory you can witness here you'll
recognize all the glow tastic components
that were loaded inside take them in now
kids because after today it's lights out
to achieve our goal we're using a
product called black 2.0 the world's
flattest maddest black art material from
Stuart Semple out of the UK short of
using carbon nanotubes this stuff is the
darkest black in a bottle and we've got
lots of it it's like a regular acrylic
paint except it uses a special base that
allows it to hold way more pigment than
usual drying with a super flat non
reflective finish so even if some
chipper rainbow thumper shows up at your
land party with RGB strobe lights and a
glowing fidgets spinner in your face
your rig will actually be able to absorb
the fun
finally a PC that says soul-sucking and
nihilistic as you are we blacked out the
most egregious parts of the machine
first yes
your feeble skills are no match for the
power of the dark side
oh excuse me sorry since we weren't
using spray-paint like we did in the
plasti dat PC video which you can watch
here we didn't have to do a whole lot of
masking this time around in order to
protect sensitive components instead we
relied on laser-like focus and a few
rubber stoppers to avoid painting the
motherboard headers slot pins and card
edges but who wants to paint an entire
case using a tiny filbert move-over Bob
Ross for this part it's time to pull out
the big guns now relatively speaking we
used a seven inch roller to say
night-night - the Eclipse p400 I don't
care how popular white is back in black
yeah I can't do the ac/dc thing forget
it and you know what actually now that I
think of it why stop at desecrating just
1 2017 PC hardware trend and we're back
this is this is a really weird video
anyway with the painting done and it
actually only ended up taking one bottle
of black 2.0 so for how much of it we
bought it sure lucky it isn't expensive
we were ready to put it all back
together
protip by the way if you paint over the
legend on your motherboard use the
manual to figure out where your power
and reset leads go leaving only the
answer to the question on everyone's
mind does it still work
theoretically it should be fine we did
test our black 2.0 on a sacrificial
video card before beginning the project
and while putting heavy paint on fan
blades could D balance them or slow them
down a little
perhaps affecting the rigs thermals our
expectations were high high until they
were dashed because no no it doesn't
work anymore
it actually did turn on for a little bit
but now it's as dead as you are inside
in retrospect we could have
everything with a Plasti Dip primer
since we know for sure that Plasti Dip
is non conductive but I guess we just
flew too close to the Sun on this one at
least we only killed the motherboard
since that was the only actual PCB that
we painted so there's still a valuable
lesson for our vamp friends out there
you should be able to use this product
to black out your RAM case video cards
you pretty much name it without
impacting performance or operation on
the bright side even though it's dead it
pretty much looks just like it would
have if it had worked and we hadn't
worked it so then enjoy this completely
satisfying and actually cut a goth
footage of our finished product
I can't say enough good things about
synergy it's a simple software download
that solves once and for all the problem
of having two keyboards and two mice on
your desk whatever reason you have for
running two computers at a time maybe
you want to test your code in multiple
environments and you don't like VMs or
maybe you've got a a work issued MacBook
but you prefer a PC at home synergy will
allow you to use the same keyboard and
mouse seamlessly across both of them you
just drag and drop them else across the
screen and it works in Windows Mac and
even Linux and it isn't even limited to
just two systems you can have as many as
I think we've tested like five at a time
we've got a basic and pro option with a
one-time payment and features include
things like clipboard sharing between
computers dragging and dropping files
between computers the ability to set up
hotkeys and more check out our link in
the video description to get 50% off
synergy today so thanks for watching

consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured whether it's hardware
or painting products at the links in the
video description also down there you'll
find our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one as well as our
community forum which you should totally
join back in black it's probably the
closest so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
