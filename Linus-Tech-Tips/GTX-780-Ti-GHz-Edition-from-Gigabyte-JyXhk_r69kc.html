ste TX 78641 our go is the easy way to
move photos music and videos between
your Android device and your PC click
now to learn more it's about a $50 adder
over a normal OC wind force card and for
that you get a non-reference board
design that adds two additional power
phases and replaces one of the stock six
pin connectors with an 8 pin connector
this translates into some extra tweaking
flexibility with a 116 percent max power
limit compared to 106 percent on a
reference card you get a much faster
stock clock speed this card comes at
1.15 gigahertz boost by default and
finally you get a gigabyte win for
schooler same as the other one but now
it comes with this sexy backplate which
is usually about a twenty dollar adder
if your card doesn't already come with
one the cooler is a massive six heat
pipe triple fan affair with their
triangle cool concept which is designed
to spread the hot air away from the
graphics card it's got a maximum cooling
capacity of 450 watts which I've seen in
action and it should be noted that on
modern high-end graphics cards this is
actually very important because the
better you can cool the card the more
power limit is available the better the
card will actually perform across a wide
variety of games even if you don't do
any overclocking it supports the usual
Nvidia technology so that's sli up to
4-way GPU boost 2.0 cuda physx geforce
experience gameplay recording and
streaming and the all-new g sync which
finally has some sweet looking monitors
coming for it and all the usual stuff is
included a couple adapters driver disk
etc but what I was really interested in
with this card and what I've been making
my way towards in this video is the
bending process that went on with this
card GPU binning just like any other
performance computer component like a
CPU or Ram is the process of selecting
the best parts from a large batch and
using them for a higher performance
variant of the same product than
offsetting the cost of doing that
bidding by charging more for that higher
performance product we saw with
gigabytes normal 780ti wind force that
in spite of GPU boost 2.0 z' dynamic
optimization of its performance just
adding a better cooler to a
run-of-the-mill chip doesn't necessarily
result in performance that can beat our
very very strong golden sample 780ti
reference card but in this case gigabyte
is delivering a better Bend card to
market so it's not pure luck of the draw
you have theoretically a better chip and
a very good cooler now as always we've
overclocked our cards to the max and I
think you'll be pleased to see the
results from this card that looks great
runs cool and quiet and performs well if
I told you that Luke would be out of a
job
I guess so over to you Luke then we are
preface this was something that you guys
probably already know by now if you've
been watching quite a few my videos with
780ti xin them and that is that my
reference card is very likely quite
golden if you guys want to and I think
you should if you're very interested
let's check out the overclocking dock in
the description below because you can
see all the settings for all of my cards
and you can check how these two
different cards were set against each
other in overclocking software see how
they perform and see their actual core
clocks while I'm running these tests the
gigabyte card comes really highly
overclocked outside of the box which is
a nice benefit my current reference card
is able to overclock to basically the
exact same amount to where these cards
trade just depending on what game it was
which means there's just margin of error
there but it's it's it's interesting
because if you bought a reference card
you probably wouldn't get that level of
bin it's very unlikely but if you bought
this wind force card it is more likely
that you are going to get a card that
can perform this fast so that's actually
where you're getting a lot of value out
of buying this card and as you can see
in the benchmarks it did quite well
comparative to the reference card
alright guys thanks for watching the
video as always while you're here on
YouTube be sure to favorite share
subscribe to the channel and comment
below like and dislike the video
I forgot about that one while you're
checking out the video description be
sure to check out the link to the forum
where you can comment on the video we're
more likely to respond there is it's
just a lot easier to manage and all that
kind of stuff while you're on the forum
check out the PC gaming sub section in
the forum because you can doing the star
citizen team we're about nineteen twenty
people away from being a second place
and I'm really excited for that also
while you there you can become a forum
contributor we're gonna be adding more
ads on the forum soon and if you're a
forum contributor you won't see the ads
so that's quite cool we also are selling
shirts now that's in the description
below as well and there's a few that I'm
gonna have to pick up so be sure to
check that out and as always if you
didn't hear it earlier be sure to
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
