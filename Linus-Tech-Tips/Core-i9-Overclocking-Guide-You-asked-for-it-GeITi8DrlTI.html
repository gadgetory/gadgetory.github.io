planning to do an X $2.99 overclocking
guide but at that time the whole lineup
hadn't even been launched yet so fast
forward to today we've finally got our
18 core chips and get this Intel wanted
to sponsor an overclocking guide so we
were like heck yeah let's do it
okay so if you're in a hurry to squeeze
a little more performance out of your
system you could just Ronnie Seuss's
easy tuning wizard or the equivalent
from your motherboard manufacturer but
you're here watching so my guess is you
want more so then first order of
business is component selection you're
going to want to choose a motherboard
that can handle the juice that your hike
or count CPU will need pick one with two
EPs
12 volt connectors to spread the current
out over more wires like the asus prime
x2 99 deluxe or even a rampage series
board and a high quality power delivery
system with good cooling without robust
VRMs and adequate ventilation you should
not attempt x2 99 overclocking and this
is especially true for the power-hungry
Extreme Edition which brings us to the
next item on our shopping list the power
supply you won't need to harness the
power of the atom but core I 9 HCC chips
alone can pull as much power as an
entire mainstream gaming system when
overclocked up to 500 Watts off the 12
volt rail
so most 850 watt 80 plus gold and higher
units will do you nicely but double
check with a power supply calculator for
your setup and the continuous load table
before you buy I would actually even
start at a thousand red with an 850
watts for a 14 core or higher next up
then is cooling you'll want a lot of it
from our review the core I 9 series gets
pretty toasty under load even at stock
speed so whether you choose to get
adventurous and replace the thermal
compound under the heat spreader via the
method that we showed off here or decide
to keep your warranty more intact we
recommend at least a two hundred eighty
millimeter AIO like the corsair h 115 i
or a large air cooler
knock to as NHD 15 and for the first
time in years actually a custom water
cooling loop is actually highly
recommended for the best results as for
the rest of the components higher spec
Ram wouldn't be a terrible idea but it
should be noted that in most cases it
doesn't affect performance too much
beyond 3000 megahertz and the rest
pretty much comes down to personal taste
and the goal of your build your SSD or
your graphics card won't affect your
ability to overclock unless they get
lodged in your cooling fan okay then so
you've got your build put together and a
fresh install of the OS of your choice
time to get down to business
we still prefer using the BIOS over
tools like Intel's surprisingly
versatile extreme tuning utility in
Windows cuz we're old-school like that
so first off XMP if you spent a few
bucks on fancy Ram you'll probably want
this on but if you run into stability
issues turn it off then let us know in
the comments if you'd like a separate
video down the line discussing tuning
ram frequency and timings manually next
weather XMP is off or on you'll need to
disable CPU s vid support and speed step
which prevents the CPU from
communicating with the external voltage
regulator and from down clocking to save
power while idle
once you've finished with that find
where your UEFI BIOS keeps its power
control options listed on our Asus board
as external DIGI+ power control we are
interested in a few items in here for a
load line calibration start out with a
lower value like two or three this
provides extra voltage so that as the
CPU goes from zero to a hundred when you
fire up a demanding load it doesn't wind
up starved for power momentarily causing
an error it should be noted though that
this setting can exacerbate the thermal
issue there is a reason why it's off by
default CPU current capability should
then be set to a hundred and forty
percent which will allow more power to
be supplied to the CPU
you this prevents a difficult to
diagnose condition known as vrm
throttling then spread-spectrum should
be disabled for stability and cpu power
phase control should be set first to
extreme and then dialed back if possible
once you've found a stable clock speed
that you like your final stop sort of
overclocking can be a bit of a rabbit
hole is CPU core ratio which we
recommend changing to by specific core
which allows you to specify ratios and
voltages for each individual core along
with an asterisk here that denotes the
higher tolerance turbo boost max cores
so 4.2 gigahertz is the non max single
core turbo speed for the 7900 X so we'll
use this as a starting point tweak the
multiplier higher rebooting in between
each set until you reach an unstable
level where the system won't boot then
you've got a couple of choices you can
either bump the voltage up and see if
you get stability we chatted with our
friends over at gamers Nexus they figure
about 1.25 volts on decent water cooling
is a about as high as you want to go or
you can drop back to the last stable
setting or to be safe one and permit
lower and try it again
now those asterisk scores those can
clock higher with lower voltage so be
sure to take this into consideration
while you're tuning the more you can
control the heat output of your chip the
better your results and the lower the
voltage the less heat speaking of you
may actually not need or want to add
much voltage if you can help it unless
you've got a custom loop in some cases
like our asus board using offsets will
actually offset from the auto voltage
meaning that you might even want to push
them negative depending on the readings
that you get remember guys even small
incremental bumps and voltage count for
a lot when we're talking about up to 18
cores though the
can be alleviated somewhat by using
what's called an AV X offset which down
clocks the CPU by a set amount when
running complex a VX enabled workloads
so a Souza's bio shows the a VX
frequency separately so you can actually
see the offsets results alright then so
if all goes well you've got some
settings dialed in that will work for
your CPU here's what we're using if not
clear the C millicent try again until
you do now it's time for burnin testing
now the traditional wisdom says to run a
full system load like prime95 for 24
hours to validate your overclock make
sure your CPU is not going to spit out
any calculations that aren't correct but
while that's a good idea and we would
still recommend it we've seen a lot of
situations where even a 24-hour pass
doesn't mean it's fully stable the real
test for us lately has been in heavy
start/stop loads we've actually caught
more stability failures using the 3d
modeling software blender which hits the
CPU hard across all course so there are
free scenes that can be used to
benchmark and passing longer ones like
the classroom
Barcelona pavilion or the gooseberry
production benchmark tends to be the
final pass for us now if you're working
on this and you feel like you're close
but you're not quite stable you can
maybe try increasing your CPU input
voltage starting at about 450 millivolts
above your core voltages it can help you
can also try boosting the system agent
voltage and bringing VCC i/o up to
within 50 millivolts of it to account
for variance in CPU memory controllers
especially if you're using XMP or
overclocking your RAM once everything's
stable and you're comfortable with your
thermals which you can monitor using a
free tool like hardware info 64 you've
got a few options you can increase the
clocks and rinse and repeat go through
this whole process again you can just
stick with what you have or for the
adventurous you can actually start
trying to reduce CPU core voltages
re-enable power say
features and reduce voltages for the
uncor PLL and vc cio to help tame the
heat output then validated all over
again it is a long process if you really
want to get it dialed in perfectly but
once you've done so you'll be left with
a nice performance bump over the stock
configuration in our case we managed
some good gains in clock Hungary gaming
and our already good productivity
performances unsurprisingly even better
which means you can get your work done
faster and get back to ponen noobs all
without ever leaving the comfort of the
glow of your battle station so thanks
