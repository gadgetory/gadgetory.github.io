my in-laws house to set up my off-site
backup server so here's the fractal
define our three that has my server
config in it so I'm just going to get a
little closer here I'm using manual
focus today which is sort of difficult
because this camera has a really clunky
way of doing it but let's do a quick
tour of the machine while I talk a
little bit about what I'm going to be
doing to make use of this off-site
backup server so I'll need to actually
get the side panel off for one thing and
then that fan is plugged in there so I
got to be careful with it so here we are
the off-site backup server what's the
point of this well I've got my regular
home server which backs up all my data
and doesn't protect me in the event of
theft or fire or whatever else that can
happen so I built myself a separate
machine that can do nightly backups of
all of my essentials and I want my so
okay so my home server will do a nightly
backup and then it will do a nightly
sync to this one so the home timer is
about 20 terabytes and this one is only
eight by one terabyte running in raid
five with a hot spare off of this LSI 90
240 - 4i raid card so this one's
significantly smaller which means that
I'm going to be only doing my essentials
you know my family pictures and videos
and stuff like that the boot drive is of
course air force GT 60 gig SSD and then
this ninth Drive here is actually only
for the purpose of backing up the boot
drive so backing up the actual OS it's
running Windows Home Server v2 so
Windows Home Server 2011 and it's got a
denim or rather Rob FX 81 40 so that's a
lower power but still quite high point
quite powerful eight core chip two gigs
of ram
just just random video card and it's I
mean this was the only AMD motherboard I
had lying around so it's got a crosshair
for formula
so I'm going to be throwing it under the
desk here and I'll show you guys the
software configuration shortly so the
software setup is actually fairly simple
there's just a few things you get to do
so you got to make sure that you set up
your FTP server on the on the remote
backup server so I did add NCIX tech
tips episode about this the one thing
that I left out and that one is making
sure that you set a static local IP for
the server itself because otherwise
every time you want plug or plug in an
ethernet cable it can change and that's
going to mess up all your settings so
you just set your FTP port set all your
user account settings yeah set up your
router now this is something that's a
little bit tricky so I've got all my
Windows Home Server ports forwarded and
then what I've discovered and this is
sort of weird is that whenever I'm
forwarding the FTP board even though
it's a single port if I use the single
port forwarding on my Linksys router it
doesn't work and then if I use port
range forwarding and then just put the
one port in there then it does work and
then this is my FTP transfer so once
that's all set up then what you've got
to do is make sure you're testing it so
in this case I'm remote desktop remote
desktop into my computer at home and
then making sure that I can actually
connect you can see the the FTP server
is seeing the connection and I'm in and
I can browse and so everything is
working as it should in fact here I'm
just going to show you guys you know
every time I do something here both of
those are active so this is this is my
computer at home that I'm remote desktop
tin - using Windows Home Server so now
everything is set up for remote access
to the FTP and what's left is to
actually set up the nightly sync now
that I'm back at home I can show you
guys what I've got set up here so for
those of you who haven't seen it already
that's my free buy are rather 8 by 3
terabyte storage server and this is the
software that I'm using so I'll show you
guys a couple things this is web drive
this is the
tickle $80 utility that makes this all
happen this is a heck of a lot better
than paying for a monthly service
because you set up the hardware for
yourself once you set this up and boom
you've got your own personal clouds very
cool stuff so all you got to do is add a
web drive map into a drag letter see
this is the key because without being
able to map because FTP doesn't work
exactly the same way as your local as
your local Drive so you have to kind of
trick vos so we have mapped using web
drive this off-site backup server to the
Z Drive with that we can use free
synchronization tools in order to do the
nightly sync that don't involve any kind
of like special pop special software
configuration so we can just sync some
folder to some other folder no problem
now you can do a one-time syncs with
free file sync or you can actually setup
batch one so just see if I don't know
nope wrong one see if I remember how to
do this I just did it last night yeah
here we go
so you set up these batch ones and then
you basically yeah
yeah Cree bad shot there it is okay here
we go here we go here we go
so you set it up put your batch settings
and all that and you save as you create
all these batch files now this is a very
manual way to do it but I couldn't find
anything more elegant sync TOI didn't
work I did have trouble with sync TOI
deleting things that were gone from the
left folder from the right folder no
matter how I set up the relationship so
so free file sync ended up being able to
do that even over the FTP so you set up
all these things and then you go into
the task scheduler in windows task
scheduler there it is windows and you
set up a nightly task of all of these
see where they are of all of these
things to run at a particular time every
day now as long as you don't make huge
wholesale changes in one day then it
shouldn't be shouldn't be too hard on
your internet connection but you should
have a pretty decent upload so I have a
5 megabit upload I'm hoping to upgrade
to a 15 megabit upload soon which will
give me much much faster nightly syncs
and that's pretty much it in terms of
the in terms of the software setup and
then I should show you guys what the
navigation is like from the the FTP so
this is an FTP you'd never know it
losers Linus finds some I don't know
some video or something
and videos look there's a fly in the
house so you just you can't play
directly from there it doesn't quite
work that way you can paste and then
download the file for you and because
they're there internet connection is
kind of not that fast you can see it's
not coming down all that fast as a 960
Meg file so I think you guys get the
point but you can see that this behaves
like a native Windows transfer which is
what makes all this sort of magically
come together so thank you oh okay right
so security securing your connections
outside the scope of this video
so you guys will have to figure that
part out on your own there's FTP
security there's a variety of different
things what I've done is I've set a hard
IP blacklist and then I've set a
whitelist for just myself to that remote
backup FTP so that doesn't secure me
against everything because I'm not
actually encrypting the data that I'm
transferring right now but it does
prevent people from just randomly
logging into that backup FTP by the
off-site FTP so thank you for checking
