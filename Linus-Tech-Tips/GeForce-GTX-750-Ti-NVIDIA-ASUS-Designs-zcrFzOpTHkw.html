delivers the convenience of an
all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more
we've actually got a double feature
today a gtx 750ti with a reference
design from nvidia and a spoiler alert'
by the way kick-ass a soos designed one
but first the introduction the gtx 750ti
is not on the surface the most exciting
card from Nvidia that we've ever
reviewed performance is solid sure and
power consumption is extremely low due
to the GM 107 GP or GPU cores use of
invidious all-new Maxwell architecture
but it's not exactly a Titan challenger
in terms of raw horsepower know this
product is for Tier one PC upgraders
small form-factor enthusiasts folks who
are upgrading from older something 5-0
class cards like the 550 ti or basically
anyone who's looking to get solid 1080p
performance in modern titles without
expecting to crank the details up to
maximum now NVIDIA spent a fair bit of
time in their press briefing talking
about the technologies around the card
like g-sync game stream and GeForce
experience with shadowplay gameplay
recording and streaming to twitch and
these technologies are great and a key
differentiator for Nvidia compared to
their competition but we've covered most
of the stuff in a fair bit of depth in
the past so I will refer you instead to
our decent video our shield streaming
latency test and our GTX 780 Ti review
which I have all linked below if you
can't click on the annotations where you
can learn more about all of that stuff
one other interesting thing to note
about G sync in particular that
technology is that neither of the cards
in our showcase today support it due to
their lack of DisplayPort output but
don't worry there will be 750ti cards
that do instead today I want to focus on
what exactly NVIDIA has done in order to
achieve a 4x improvement in efficiency
over three generations with only one
process shrink instead of using a
single control logic block for all 192
cores in its SMS or streaming
multiprocessors NVIDIA has created
smaller control logic blocks for 32
cores each that makes the task of
routing and scheduling traffic easier
for each control logic block and allows
Maxwell to improve performance per core
by about 35% leading to in videos best
performance per watt GPU ever it is so
efficient it needs only a tiny little
cooler for at 640 CUDA cores and 2 gigs
of 5.4 gigahertz gddr5 vram running on a
128-bit bus and it doesn't even require
a 6 pin PCI Express power connector due
to its 60 watt TDP the second focus
point for me is overclocking the way
NVIDIA has locked down overclocking over
the last few generations with respect to
maximum voltages and power limits has
been frustrating so it's refreshing to
see them come out and say this card is a
great overclocker and I'm excited that
we get to show your results from both of
these cards at the same time because
they represent two very different
approaches to graphics card design the
reference card is very very small and
requires no power connector so it'll be
compatible with pretty much any PC with
the PCI Express slot a Seuss's
non-reference benefits list continues to
be the same as ever ten extra bucks gets
you slightly increased stock clock
speeds a better eyalet out although no
DisplayPort still a better cooler better
PCB design with a Seuss's si P super
alloy power components promising cooler
operation longer life time better
efficiency and reduced coil lines but
there's more this time the 750 Ti
normally doesn't have that connector
while the assess one has a PCI Express 6
pin connector however weird the
positioning of this connector might be
unless you're installing in a small
form-factor PC where that's closer to
the power supply on the back of the card
it'll be interesting to see how more
power affects a card like this when it
comes to overclocking and performance
spoiler alert a lot stay tuned for
exactly how much these 280 bitty
graphics cards pack quite a punch
they come on top of both my Far Cry 3
and BioShock Infinite benchmarks and you
can tell by looking at these numbers
that that a soos after
market card does gain a lot by having
that additional six pin power on top of
there if you want to see how much it
helps you can check out my overclocking
dock in the description of the video
down below where you can see all of my
settings for both of the cards and their
core clock actuals so you can see
exactly how fast they are running maybe
you're someone who wants the additional
power and wants to be able to overclock
it even more this card has tons of
headroom and even if you don't want that
additional power maybe just want to go
with the reference design it still has a
bunch of headroom there this is a very
easy card to overclock I got a run guys
as it is 4 a.m. Tuesday and I've been up
since Sunday morning working on
different forum stuff and whatnot this
video has to be edited uploaded and
released by 6:00 a.m. so we're going to
see how I can accomplish that but we
will see if you like and favorite and
dislike the video and share and
subscribe to channel and all of those
things and in addition I'm not giving up
yet
I want that second place position for
organizations check out the PC gaming
section of the Linus tech tips com forum
look at the star system thread and join
the organization we will be number two
we can make it I'll talk to you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
