a genuine Intel desktop board ok that's
good this is extreme series optimized
for Intel K processors so this is an
extreme series board and is optimized
for Intel K processors because this is
an LGA 1155 board which means that you
don't have support for Intel Extreme
Edition processors on LGA 2011 the d77
re 75k has a bunch of cool stuff so
number one is in the extreme board
supports Intel Core i7 i-5 and i3 highly
optimized for K processors which means
overclocking friendly yay Intel visual
BIOS which means UEFI BIOS PCI Express
3.0 LGA 1155 processor support nvidia
sli technology and d crossfire X
technology look at that it's aimed a
logo on an intel product um lucid virtu
MVP virtualization for improved
performance as well as the ability to
use the onboard video for quick sync and
your dedicated graphics card for gaming
and what else do you want to talk about
oh yeah it has Thunderbolt which is boss
so transformational high speed dual
protocol yeah you know Intel has like
the boringest way of talking about like
the coolest stuff sometimes no offense
guys but transformational high speed
dual protocol PCI Oh delivering
performance simplicity and flexibility
fastest IO connection to your PC what
they really mean is like beastly
Thunderbolt technology for like the
fastest daisy-chaining awesomeness and
that's what they were trying to say
latest responsiveness sectionals yot
Intel Smart Response technology with SSD
caching until a rapid start so you can
quickly start up your PC and Intel smart
connect technologies are all present
power supervisor
well let's need some monitor insurance
system protection from power supply
failure current surge and over current
protection in the event of power spikes
I reduce the power supervisor will shut
the power off that's really cool so
they're building it like a like breakers
almost
the board by the sounds of things which
is really neat I mean one of the biggest
risks to a PC in general is if you know
there's a power problem of some sort and
your power supply explodes which is
inconvenient and expensive because you
got to get a new one but it can also be
a total disaster because it can take
other stuff with it at the same time so
Intel is thought of that and decided
that they don't really want that to
happen and there's all custom sli bridge
love it look at that blue connectors I
don't have one like this I'm like
totally pocketing this done Intel
mousepad Intel has awesome swag that
comes with their products check this out
I still have this from this was back
like some extreme edition LGA 775 board
warning noobs be where you will be pwned
love it actually it might have come with
what was that board skull trail or
something the one that was dual socket
you have hot story
extreme desktop boards sweet mousepad
actually feels reasonably nice got a
nice grip enos on the back very cool
we've also got look at that a front USB
3 so internal header two front three and
a half inch drive with two USB 3.0
connectors and it's pretty nice like as
brushed metal it's not plastic like some
of the ones that I've seen included with
other boards very nice I mean let's
think about the Intel is it might be a
little bit more expensive but they tend
to get some of the finishing touches
right and I say some because these are
read SATA cables that's just tragic okay
moving right along body so they include
a an external I think this is Wi-Fi and
bluetooth but let me just double check
before I go and you know get ahead of
myself here
includes bluetooth 2.1 Wi-Fi b/g/n
modules that's very very new and they
also include a cable to connect it so
this probably plugs in where on earth
the system know when it's internal oh
that's cool so you can probably use this
on anything it's just USB look at that
internal USB plug to internal USB header
and you just stick it somewhere to the
inside of your case discreetly very nice
and this is even pretty easy to sleep as
well so you could sleep in black and it
look really good color coded i/o shield
summary of a summary of postcodes very
nice love it when they include a post
read out love it even more when they
actually tell you what they mean driver
disk sort away integration guide in
color all in color how to build your PC
very nice there you go and you can tell
like a team of people worked on anything
that Intel releases so little quick
guide to all the different various front
panel connectors processor compatibility
yeah ok LGA 1155 and some maximum image
breezy things ok cool moving on to the
board itself Intel has really figured
out the aesthetics of their boards ever
since LGA 775 I think and Dave this
whole like skull theme thing that
they've got going on I think looks
really good it's a lot better than like
guns and bullets and stuff like that
it's got like you know like a silvery
sort of stylized look to it it goes
really really well with the dark blue
love silver and dark blue as far as
color schemes go and I'm not gonna gush
too much about how good-looking this
board is but it's it's good-looking
without being sort of overly flashy and
kind of silly so all solid-state caps
all over the entire board there's no no
liquid caps including the power delivery
as well as every other component on the
board there's the LGA 1155 socket with a
lot of room around it which is great if
you have a large aftermarket cooler your
8 pin power connectors and it's ideal
location on the left you've got support
for a dual channel ddr3 memory up to
probably 64 gigs would be would be my
guess but we'll see it depends on
depends on
availability over the next little bit
you can at least put you can at least
put 32 bigs in today 24 power connectors
and it's ideal location along the
right-hand edge onboard power and reset
buttons very very nice
we've bought say two three six gigabit
per second ports off the Intel chipset
say two to three gigabit per second
ports and it's very rare for Intel to
include like a third party chipset but
they've got a Marvel chipset providing
two more say two three six gigabit per
second ports that's that's fantastic Wow
front i/o I consider this to be the
ideal location for front i/o I really
like this I don't really like it when
they put it over here because your front
i/o is always there never somewhere else
and you're always using it you know it's
not like USB to where there's a chance
you won't be using it ok so there's
three front panel USB 2 ports two front
panel USB 3 ports spit if out as well as
front panel oh look at that front panel
firewire nice to still see that where's
the front panel audio though there it is
he okay
expansion slots we've got seven love
seeing boards with seven expansion slots
because what that means to someone like
me is that they put the effort in to
make sure that they were filling up all
of the space and giving you as much
expansion as they possibly can so these
will run in either 16 X or 8 X 8 X mode
PCI Express 3.0 1 2 3 PCIe 1x slots and
2 PCI slots if you're using two dual
slot graphics cards you'll be left with
2 PCIe 1x and one PCI slot I consider
this to be a very good mix good on you
Intel alright
low yeah let's have a look at fan
headers so we've got one two three four
PWM fan connectors on the board
the locations aren't as perfect as I'd
like I'd like to see more fan headers
sort of around here because otherwise
there's not really much to connect your
front fans to top fans can so CPU fan
top fan rear fan and this is sort of in
no-man's land I'd like to see a couple
up here instead but it's not the end of
the world on the back we've got four USB
2.0 connectors a ps/2 connector firewire
eSATA I'm gonna have to find out what
that is
dual Intel gigabit ethernet 4 USB 3.0
HDMI as well as oh that must be the must
be Thunderbolt
it just looks funny no it's not no there
it is yeah we'll find out what that is
probably a clear seamless switch though
hdmi 7.1 audio out optical audio out and
a thunderbolt connector so give me a sec
guys so yeah basically this will when
you illuminate this it'll get you back
to the BIOS set default settings which
is basically clear CMOS switch but not
quite however this is a clear seamless
jumper so you just go ahead and flip
that over in order to clear the CMOS I
think that pretty much covers it
although it does have a couple of yeah a
couple of interesting software bits that
are included including McAfee ESET Smart
Security this is neat Splashtop remote
desktop is included although there's
like an Asterix so other names and
brands etc flat blank PCmover and you
can monitor PC health with the Intel
desktop utility these stuff so what's
the point pretty much everything you
need in terms of Io
I was wrong it's 32 gigs Mac's by the
way everything you need in terms of i/o
every feature you could possibly ask for
including the latest Thunderbolt
technology SLI crossfire all that good
stuff and I mean it's built by Intel so
like you know realistically it's got a
three-year warranty but if it's not
working 10 years from now I'll be very
surprised thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the D 77 re
75 K from Intel don't forget to
subscribe for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and how exactly am
I gonna put this motherboard in this box
okay you're in my spot</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
