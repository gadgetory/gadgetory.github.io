new D brand grip
learn more at the link below this one
brother named Jerry yes actually that's
me I just got another email for
something wrong I guess oh really yeah
it was regarding you're not Johnny okay
hold on hold on okay can you pause the
interview for a second I want to show
you trick watch this okay now you see
Linus where do you go that's right the
disguise today not actually very
effective well it's too late now I
already did the deal oh no I don't
careful good no I get I can trust you I
get just qualified if I get disqualified
if you recognize me before we agree on
the price what we're filming scrapyard
bores oh okay
yeah and 980ti is work for that yeah you
know that's pretty poor I got a chicken
and I've actually been pulling - take
for a long time do you want to be ID you
want to be in the episode sure well it's
good cuz you are max check out the goods
Dimitri you know the iron is I couldn't
find my receipts of NCIX why else oh
there's the SLI bridge look at it did we
get a high bandwidth bridge nice there's
another 200 beautiful we are blowing
like the vast majority of our budget on
these cards but uh you know what we're
gambling we're gambling that we can do
the rest of the system for like five
hundred there you are yeah thank you
good now that you know who I am I
definitely can't accept any help from
you okay so this is a challenge though
Dimitri not only do we have to find an
SLI board we have to find one with this
damn spacing before you tough that has a
middle slot empty yeah
it's just one middle just one middle
empty slot now you know what that's the
most common spacing we might be okay
okay okay so we got the high bandwidth
bridge we've got the 980ti z-- let's uh
let's go back to talking to that asshole
with the 9:20 combo I message this guy
in like yo will you take 200 he's like
no period like well okay here's a combo
with a similar grade motherboard a
better CPU more RAM and it comes with a
GPU case power supply and a hard drive
and he's like well maybe you should buy
that then some guys some people's kids
man how did you feel when the line is
send you the cash is a picture the cash
picture yep confident that was so that
was effective yes ha soon as I see cash
it's a little more confident to make the
journey
yeah medals so it's up to par to get
here all right well yeah magnificent a
feeling better they did see cool man
alright thank you and these better work
speaking of for reference I was emailing
you back while using the computer with
those in it alright
sick man okay take care all right we've
got one successful veal down yes the
rest the system to go yeah we can do it
we can do it okay so you know what now
that we're at the sky train station I
think we should actually hang here for a
bit
get on the computer and see if we can
source source some leads here so let's
go find like a bench or something and
let's hang for a bit see okay every
single time that I see a system deal I
freaked out because it seems like it
can't be working but I could not find
anything cheaper in that no you get my
stuff with cheaper but not with those
specs yeah
so we just stumbled across that it's
just crazy we stumbled across that ad
because I looked up computer case yeah
okay so it's 6700 K is 450 you have
invented by ddr4 too expensive how how
confident you that Alliance is already
message done these 10 eighties oh yeah
I'm sure he's not any tea eyes pretty
common posted a five hundred and ten
dollars would be a sixty seven hundred K
and eight gigs of RAM dude wait that's
not near us it's like way over there
it's doable if we get that system yeah
I think we should go forward with our
original plan okay that's honestly where
I am only because it's it's together
we're talking to him he's communicating
with us he's loading the car as we speak
so it's guaranteed that we have a
working system plus
I think if we like yeah I think there's
there's two different roads here we can
get the system and be moving because
here's the thing consider this those
parts although not hard to get to are
all in different places cab or bus train
and all these directions of ten bucks
five bucks five minutes Emma's right so
they've been in a day how much do we
have left versus knowing we're gonna get
all this for the price of one walk and
we haven't even touched our funds with
the exception of $750 to him and we
still might have a little bit of
bartering room in terms of like if he
recognizes us we can't do it but the guy
was already wanted to talk business on
the phone we hadn't even met yet yeah so
I think that's the only thing I'm a
little concerned with this the ad said
you had two hard drives to two terabyte
hard drives
yeah cuz I mean eyes you know capacity
is kind of the thing yeah when you're
doing large video format if this
computer staying here it's staying here
with him yeah yeah cuz what I can do
what I can do is drop that off to you
later on it'd probably be better for us
if we could just get a few bucks off for
the missing drive if that would work I
mean I don't really want to go down on
price to be honest with you you know I
think it's still a pretty good deal for
what it is okay so we can get that drive
later though yeah absolutely that Drive
later okay which way are you heading now
I am heading that way
towards her Jamaica that's in the
direction we need to go I'm wondering if
you maybe can drop us off just a few
blocks it that way we have room for
Brandon this whopper leave his stuff in
the back right I was really hoping that
we could get him down 50 bucks but he
shot that note of the water immediately
then he showed up with one less hard
drive then he said he had when we were
looking through the case and he wouldn't
give us any cash he wouldn't give us
back any cash for that at all which
sucked so we just literally asked him
like hey could you give us a ride back
to where you need to go so we got the
deal a discount parts to sell and he
gave us a ride back to base and
unfortunately with the camera and buying
I mean basically we have a complete
system that works here right now that
now we can work backwards on to upgrade
where we need we solve a lot of budget
leftover we set 537 no $587 up over we
have enough budget right now to get a
980ti
and an SSD to finish this system out but
it has a standard Intel box cooler 90 Ti
is probably not quite what we want it's
got a it's got an ASIS the mats miss
Borden it isn't yeah we got we got a
pretty wicked case we got an optical
drive we got like 16 gigs of ram we got
a GTX 660 I've got a 4770k and Intel
stock cooler three USB 3.0 expansion
cards two monitors and I think that's it
so we want to get a cooler for it and we
want to overclock it and just crank the
CPU because that would be awesome
we want to try to sell some of stuff
like the monitors the optical drive the
two hard drives that we're getting with
it possibly but extremely low likeness
the case because it's actually a really
nice case and we could spec that down
and possibly get a GTX 1080 and
something like an H 110 I because
there's one of those on sale right now
and if we can do that we'd have a very
overclockable system with a 1080 in it
yeah I mean I'm I would rather see us
get a 1080 with the 47 70 yeah in a
980ti with a 6700 which is what we were
kind of now that was our conundrum here
was okay we could piece together 60
700k within budget the parts were spread
out all over Vancouver area yeah and who
knows if we could how easily we could
have got them if one of those parts like
if someone snatched the motherboard who
might have been screwed yeah if someone
patch snatched the CPU we'd be screwed
yeah and so it was just too big of a
risk to do that so I think the 1080 is
gonna be the right way to go freaking it
one yeah yeah so now it's time to get to
work we need to clean up this case
because there's a lot of dust in it when
you verify everything works verify
everything works take take the parts out
that we want to sell get some pictures
of them flip things so we can afford
that graphics card I want to talk to
high quality i7 guy here yeah so this is
a $400 build but has everything that we
need but also some stuff that we don't
but I recognize the Google Maps location
here I think I might have dealt with
this guy before which is not against the
rules if he doesn't know who I am
yeah sometimes the human memory works in
funny ways like I was pretty surprised
with myself that I saw a pin on a Google
Maps thing on Craigslist and went you
know what I think I dealt with that guy
in scrapyard Wars before hi I'm calling
about the the core i7 build that you
have on Craigslist yeah um I was
wondering is that all the stuff you have
or do you have other computer stuff as
well and then I was 5x surprised when I
got on the phone with him and he
immediately is like I think I've dealt
with you before about a year ago oh
really
or something like that oh all right
yep yeah oh yeah I know actually I do
remember that believe it or not that guy
okay cool um well now that now that wait
so hold on a second
I forget did did you know me from
anywhere else or just from dealing with
you on Craigslist okay well then no sir
I told you I recognized your voice
because I like watch some of a- at
Kempton you guys cuz I by myself in it
yeah yeah oh yeah that's right okay well
the rules of our competition dictate
that I can't use like you knowing who I
am to help me so I might tell you why
can I just get a little bit of
information like do you are you able to
part out any stuff or like well
basically CPU motherboard I was
wondering if you have more RAM actually
like if you have another stick to make
it an even 12 the 960 well hold on let
me let me pitch kind of this to you
because I actually want more RAM so if I
could get another 4 gig stick around
that would be optimal and then the only
actually thing I don't need is the GPU
which is a 68 70 that's a sellable GPU
and the power supply if you could
upgrade it to something better
over
GPU like chirps of trying to get on I
can't use the power supply cause that's
what it came with but I don't have and
that's your pretty attacks by the rack
what it did it it's like instead of
hitting hear something or 620 counter
which is which it's a high current gamer
620 and I need something better I'll end
up wasting that one I need like a 750 I
need something with 4px 750 no that one
might have four do you have it next to
you yeah PCI Express connectors for it
looks like it does have four okay and I
mean would you say you're giving me a
special deal in any way here if he
doesn't give me a deal because of who I
am that is within the rules of scrap
card wars and I think we can all agree
he didn't give me a deal like like is
this the same deal you would have done
for anyone else another question for you
do you have the SLI bridge that came
with that gigabyte board so can I get
back to you in the next couple hours
sure okay cool so um I think we like the
i7 better so it was the i7 with an
upgrade to 12 gigs removed the graphics
card change 620 to 750 and and then it's
20 bucks off got it okay thank you good
sir
so 800 bucks for our graphics cards 1273
for tomato and ham sandwich a beautiful
sandwiches beautiful sandwich is the
best sandwich is I think the most fun
part of today aside from getting a
baller deal on 980 t is had to be making
sandwiches on the back of a macbook pro
on the bus and then eating them it was
actually great the greatest I ate only
was in 40 cents for Sky train passes
that's totally unreasonable well that's
just for one way we still have to get
back and so yeah and like I don't want
to walk back so there's that so so far
we spent eight hundred and twenty we
actually only have five hundred and
fifteen dollars left so if we buy the
375 system yeah that covers all of our
remaining hardware no it doesn't know
because we still need that comes with a
power supply and SSD no it hasn't this
is the no it doesn't we have self 140
bucks for an SSD here you might have to
like hike for it like what's water SSD
is going farward hike for this is the
man here 120 gig only $72 $67 can get
two of those or too cheap once or one we
run okay wait a minute okay what are you
thinking am i picking up what you're
throwing down we show up with dual
graphics cards in SLI and cool SSDs and
rape rate yeah I actually kind of I kind
of like that idea
mind you this Patriot blaze is only 80
bucks and it's 240 gigs in downtown
Vancouver which is exactly where we're
going
perfect well that's an ambulance posted
two days ago so it's fresh so we should
we go for the yeah we could be done with
scrap yard Wars in one day but then what
are we gonna do for the rest of the time
build-it all we can explore the city
because so it would just be Linus and
Dimitri and go on adventures for two as
long as we have a budget for like extra
ham and tomato then I'm good and the
some bus tickets you know me because
otherwise we're just walking everywhere
yeah a pale downhill yeah that's true
but we wouldn't have to carry anything
because our computer would be built and
benchmarked right and the funny thing is
is we control those guys so hard because
we'd be like yeah so like our systems
done because I always say that and my
systems never actually done so this
would be the first time you can say that
well hopefully we haven't done all the
part that we don't actually have any of
it yet okay I'll tell you what this SSD
deal here this Patriot blaze actually
looks pretty darn good
like do you see any have you seen
anything that good 80 bucks
that's good Plus that leaves us with 40
bucks left over here let me fill it in
to the sheet so I don't have to cut take
out my calculator no so that leaves us
$60 to get to downtown rig enough beast
and we could afford subway but should we
no we should go we should go to the the
grocery store and we should get lettuce
and tomato and some avocados in there
Sava kados the thing is I like what this
guy's offering because that way it's
like an all-encompassing package yeah
that definitely has value built into it
power supply case motherboard CPU cooler
it's a stock cooler well it's not a
great cooler we won't be able to
overclock much if at all
should i lowball the $80 SSD or should I
just offer asking price we can't afford
it we don't want to lose it look dude
let's see if he if he's willing to do 70
bucks yeah okay shoot if we want to do
this SL I think we really are limiting
our options
so should we list one of them now let's
do it let's do it let's list one just to
see if we can get some money for it in
case we can't yeah
let's list it how much should we list it
for it 450 yeah
oh I got a message from let go somebody
messaged me already
is the price negotiable this is for the
GPU we just posted look even if we make
like 30 bucks on this we make money you
guys already know D brand they make the
precision cut vinyl skins that make your
phone look nice and protect it from
incidental scuffs and scratches but
today no no not that today is something
new this is the grip and it's not just
another phone case it is the grittiest
phone case that you have ever seen and
it's got this super cool like patented
impact protection technology that works
super awesome and it's fully integrated
with the brand's customization meaning
that you can use any D brand skin with
your grip so check it out today we've
got it linked in the video description
someone wants to buy both monitors
already my heart is pumping cuz the way
he yelled I was like he broke something
no no no I'm just not even done taking
apart yet like I got the text I assumed
it was the guy bringing the hard drive
yeah so wants to buy both 405 where is
he yet and can he come to us usually
buyers have to go to the buyer or the
seller so so just say sure yeah well
what did we list the man 75 our best
offer each so other than a special deal
for both remember we said we'd take 50
each justified more than we agreed oh I
saw this one was like hell yeah because
we only need for my like mystical spec
top number that I came up with we only
need a hundred and forty eight and we
serve the graphics card to sell hello oh
yes yes yeah one of them is open we just
tried it right now - you know what
Riccio capable right within that first
hour the guy was here and picked him up
and off they were going and we've
already got buyers lined up for both
hard drives that was that was like that
was the most important part that had to
happen for this deal to make sense so
now we are literally like so far ahead
of the game because we now had the funds
for 1080
if we okay so GTX 1080 is definitely on
the table now based on pricing that
we've seen already we were trying to
maybe haggle or or really lowball some
1080i is out there but that's not gonna
happen but we're gonna have money left
over at this point so I think we're
thinking like well go do something fun
when do we end today can someone come by
something at 6:30 that's a form of
communication but we started soul or
communicating we're not going anywhere
that's a form of communication come on
go at it come on
what time do you want to come by he
wants to come at 6:30 I mean that's
production problem that ours
that's obviously not gonna work call him
and ask me hey man could weeks how do
you feel like extending the pickup today
I'm just gonna ask the guy if he can be
here by 6:00
he's probably say no it's 19 minutes yo
can we go like 10 15 minutes over time
because we started late I don't know I
mean it seems like you know whenever I'm
asking for mercy actually you know what
I can't I can't really I can't really
argue this you're usually pretty good
about it I mean you know we're gonna be
back on time but uh you know okay sure
yeah you know it's never worked out
badly for me to go easy on the other
team that means that the yeah you got
and yeah that means you guys owe us a
15-minute 20-minute over-over it with
interest with interest give an extra two
minutes okay so no then cuz it doesn't
matter that much ya know then we'll keep
it super fun all right never mind see
you later credit card interest credit
card interest
they're gonna do it anyway yeah it's
nice the yes yeah it's nice of them to
ask see that guys available tomorrow
night I'm going to so if he gave us 15
he'd won an hour and the thing is he'd
be able to use it for a much more
opportunity ping than like selling a
hard drive for 15 bucks ya know if it
was if it was this for 50 or 60 to be a
little bit I'd care a little more yeah I
don't really care about that
hey it's Nick I was just wondering when
you're coming by to drop off that hard
drive I'll get to leave sorry yeah we
head out fairly soon I know you said
you're gonna be by in like a few minutes
and it's been I think an hour or so now
two hours so yeah just wondering what's
going on thank you
right okay I might have been overhyping
Demetri as a partner a little bit before
you kept bitching about wanting water
like like oh oh we should get water oh
can we stop for water I'm like yeah ada
tomato tomatoes are basically water
expensive water okay - lets get a water
before we buy tickets look he actually
wanted to stop and get water at a
convenience store at a skytrain station
that have been like $4 water it wouldn't
been fancy Fuji water just like Nestle
water anyway I denied him the water
not that I'm cheap or that I wanted me
to suffer it's just that I don't want to
spend the money and
money yeah okay what the hell man I need
my water so we found some really good
price of motherboards x58
platform yeah SLI compatible it's not
compatible for for 90 bucks and then
you're looking for CPUs for that
motherboard yeah under 100 bucks yeah I
found something 480 about CPUs for 1366
easy-to-find motherboards not so easy to
find but I haven't heard anything from
the SSD guy but I have an update for you
I heard back off Craigslist of it from
someone looking for the ninety days yeah
but what I'd like to do if we can use
part together in its 58 platform I also
have a lead on a 64 X 58 CPU the guy
wants to thirty forty I'm gonna try and
convince and that's way too much and go
from there hello I'm calling about the
computer parts for sale I'm particularly
interested in the motherboard they get
you buy an e X 58 and the it the RAM the
16 gigabytes plus the cooler these 50
as it dies it's still doable where we
already have the CPU and don't need a
graphics card or the case any chance you
were really too
there's a whole unit
okay okay then thank you so this is a a
nice L or i5 750 hyper 6-12 cooler
overclockable overclocking capable sli
motherboard 16 gigs of ram
you could probably ask for a little bit
off for this crappy 48 50 and they're
going out of town on Thursday so they
need a quick sale we might be able to
lowball this so this could be a really
good fit for us with our sli graphics
cards
especially because the spacing fits
everything yeah so and just follow me
with some cryptic nonsense though being
late for like seven minutes behind and
only due to the SkyTrain having issues
today you know but do you think that
maybe when they called us and they said
they need 15 more minutes they implied
that
I don't know he's late you usually
didn't ask okay
it's not that you want more right now
it's that you want more from Lyons yeah
you want yeah you want him to he was a
jerk on the phone we needed some time he
said no now he's late without calling
and asking I'm okay with it because we
called and asked for a little lenient
see on the time right there is that deal
we're trying to work out there was gonna
be enough time we were talking a matter
of minutes a couple of minutes we in 10
minutes tops okay so I just heard back
from the guy with the 950 okay yes we
have the CPU all he's a creep the price
it's still available what the heck is
going on over there the weirdest part of
the day for me was definitely coming
back and like everyone waiting outside
like I was expecting some kind of like
hugely impactful dramatic moment like my
bike got towed or something
how's it going great so how wrecked do
you get for that
not at all yeah absolutely actually you
were in here on time yeah so you guys
were asking us for 20 minutes yeah and
you didn't give it to me
what we didn't know he said okay never
mind I have a recording he said okay
never mind and we have the phone cuz it
doesn't matter that much ya know then
we'll keep it super fun alright
nevermind see you later yeah we cancel
the deal yeah
nice try though and then they were just
like whining because we had said we
wanted extra time with interest and we
were like joking with them so what
exactly do you want I don't know
you can get twenty minutes you take more
money what no or like an hour and a half
x-ray or something now in the half hikes
yeah I mean we have a significant event
that we could have done you guys know I
think in our works I think that if the
event was that significant they would
have fought harder for it at the end of
the day I was absolutely looking for
extra time we had lined up a sale for a
hard drive that we wanted to get off our
hands because we want to sell all this
stuff as fast as we can
I added some margin of error because a
lot of people are late to things so I
was like okay 6:15 6:20 so I asked for
time until 6:15 or 6:20 and that was
tonight so you cheated already I mean
it's been one day you said you'd be back
on time I was very good-natured about it
I actually don't know what you're
talking about the scrapyard Wars has
almost never ended exactly on times of
you and it's been fairly typical for you
to be late you were late when you were
the last person here today right because
I didn't get told the address because
you didn't ask I graciously gave them
their hour that they asked for and I had
a totally good attitude about it so take
your hour all right when we were
speaking with the other team about
giving them the 15 minutes that they
needed that they were asking for I think
the the overreacted in the the hanging
up process which we didn't even realize
happened because of the we are the loud
bus nation environment
alright alright
credit card interest credit card
interest so we kept talking into the
phone
realizing that they hang up on us so I
think it just kind of a miscommunication
on both sides in terms of what happened
this is a regular phone this is a
gripped phone this is for comedic effect
so get a grip coming soon
