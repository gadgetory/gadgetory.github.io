brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital we're gonna kick off our
Sennheiser booth tour with a look at
their game series headsets now they did
make a bit of a mistake here they they
spelled game wrong they're like German
or something so maybe spelling in
English isn't a strong point but
designing headsets is so we're going to
start with the game one if you've ever
used an HD 500 series headphone in the
last little while these will probably
look familiar they've got cloth padding
they have sort of a it's a soft but not
memory foam style padding the drivers
inside them are actually very similar to
500 series drivers but they've made a
couple small tweaks to enhance things
like sound effects as well as dialogue
in games without completely destroying
the sound signature because Sennheiser
does know a thing or two about not
destroying the sound signature on their
products they have also updated the ID
so they've got kind of a white glossy
design that's quite beautiful looking
with a red metallic accent colour that
goes around certain parts of it they've
got a self muting microphone so you've
got to do is lower that to get it to
work and then raise it to get it to stop
transmitting and then finally to make it
a gaming headset they of course have a
volume control knob on the other ear now
this is the lower end of the tool though
both of them cost over $200 but this one
right here is the one that I think many
gamers will find quite interesting where
the game one uses an open back design
meaning that sound tends to leak both in
and out which is not the greatest thing
for immersion personally I prefer open
back just because it does give a bit
more of a natural feeling to the sound I
think many gamers will be looking for
the game one so this uses a closed back
design they've got sort of a pleather
synthetic leather cover on the ear cups
this enhances the noise isolation as
well as being more comfortable for
certain people although I personally do
prefer cloth it also has a memory foam
design for both the ear cups and for the
headband and as you can see that
happened while I was sitting you're
holding it it has nice swiveling ear
cups so you can easily hang
around your neck as well as a folding
design so you can pack it up and take it
with you wherever you go now both of
these headsets use standard
three-and-a-half millimeter jacks which
is great for PC gamers because with the
way that sound card technology has
advanced in the last little while even
on just integrated oh I just turned on
those speakers because I unplugged this
anyway even with onboard sound I don't
see a particular reason why you would
need a USB interface unless you you know
really had some special effects you
wanted to apply to it but the good news
about it is that with this simple little
adapter you've got not only PC
compatibility but also PlayStation 4
compatibility out of the box this
adapter is going to come at about $14.99
it'll be available in a little while
however you know even though we're
standing in Sennheiser's booth I'll tell
you guys there's nothing particularly
special about it it's a four pool two
dual three pole adapter you can pick
these up almost anywhere and boom you're
ready to go on your PC or on your
Playstation with either of these games
series headsets we've got three
significant updates to send Heiser's pro
series products and I'll start with what
they all have in common they all come
with a professional-grade hard case
that's actually super super nice it's
got gorgeous hard foam inside I wouldn't
be worried about damaging these at all
they both come they all come there are
actually three models they all come with
two sets of ear cups you whether you
prefer more of a pleather feel or
whether you want something that's a
velour which is a little bit different
from the traditional cloth ear cup that
you'll find on headphones because it
will tend to help with noise isolation a
little bit more than a very very
breathable cloth they all come with
detachable cables which you can actually
plug into either side so if you have
mixing equipment that tends to sit more
off to your left and you don't want the
cable coming up that side that's going
to be no problem for you and they all
come with both a straight cable and with
a coiled cable the last thing that they
all include is of course robust rugged
build quality although one of them is a
little bit ahead of the others in terms
of that space then we've got the hd7 DJ
an HD 8 DJ the key differences between
these two are that the hd7 DJ tends to
have a little bit of a brighter sound at
the high end and has a metal and plastic
construction other than that they are
lower impedance then the hd6 mix so
95 ohms it can be used on pretty much
anything and they both have is this is a
first for Sennheiser check this out guys
they've got a swiveling ear cup design
that has three distinctly locking
positions so you can position them
directly over the ear a little bit kind
of half off the year or way up there so
they sit on the head in a comfortable
manner while being completely out of the
way now I'd like to move on to the HD 8
DJ this one features an all-metal
construction so it has some additional
robustness to go along with the while DJ
optimized sound signature so that is to
say that unlike the hd6 mix these ones
are fairly fairly more neutrally except
in bass so they're going to be able to
pound the bass and they're going to be
able to pound it hard they're both
capable of delivering up to a hundred
and fifteen decibels of high-quality
sound to your ear which is something
that I wouldn't necessarily recommend
doing but hey if you're in a loud Club
and you've got to hear what you're
working on then I guess you don't really
have much of a choice so thanks for
