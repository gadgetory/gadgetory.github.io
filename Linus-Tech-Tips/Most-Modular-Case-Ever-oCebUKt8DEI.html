Computex 2016 this year check out their
lap dog it allows you do game on the
couch with a keyboard and mouse it's
pretty cool description down below also
thank you to MSI they have a cool aigis
desktop here and there GTX 1080 so this
is the dark bass pro 900 and instead of
starting with the outside and slowly
going in like I normally do with the
case I'm going to go right to the juicy
stuff this is the removable motherboard
tray as you can see it's in my hand
instead of like in the case that's
natural that's supposed to happen it has
stuff like rubber bumps on the back so
you can actually put it down on a table
and it can rest nicely without
scratching any things you can build your
computer almost entirely outside of the
case and then slot this guy in and go
from there we recommend in all of our
build guides to build outside of the
case first this allows you to do that
but not waste all of your work the two
other adjustment points for the
motherboard tray are vertical adjustment
and inversion so a vertical adjustment
makes it so you can either bring it down
to be more compatible with thicker
radiators or bring it up so you can get
above the power supply and show off your
entire motherboard inversion makes it so
you can flip it over put it on the other
side of your case have your graphics
cards pointing up all that kind of fun
stuff and move the windowed side panel
to the other side to have your have your
case in like a switch configuration it
has a ton of cable management loops for
velcro straps or zap straps or whatever
else and a fan controller it has three
PWM and three non PWM plugs although
this is the non pro version the pro
version has four of each I'll get more
into the differences of those later on
also in the back of the motherboard tray
is a single SSD slot if you only want to
have one SSE you can kind of tuck it
back there it's all nice clean and tidy
and a massive CPU cooler cut out so you
can easily install whatever you have
speaking of CPU cooler if you want to go
with water cooling you can naturally fit
a 360 or 420 millimeter rad in the top
and if you want to go for the front if
you remove the five and a quarter inch
Bay you can fit also a 360 or 420
millimeter rad or if you leave it in
there I believe you can fit a 240 or 280
all of the fan intakes are filtered with
removable filters which is great and
when you get the case it comes with
three solid wings three 140 mm
fans another cool thing about the
cooling is that the air doesn't actually
come in from the bottom of the case
it comes in from the side of the bottom
of the case you don't have to worry as
much about the computer being on carpet
or something like that where you might
pick up different debris which is never
fun next up in the modular fund we have
the hard drive trays so the computer is
pro and non pro come with seven of these
different modular hard drive units so
you can fit seven hard drives or
fourteen SSDs as one can be mounted at
the top and one can be mounted in the
bottom you can also buy two additional
if you want to remove that five and a
quarter inch bay that's up there which I
expect you probably will anyways
although I don't know if you need that
many drives that means theoretically you
could have 19 total SSDs in proper
mounting positions but we also know that
you could just dangle them around and
that would be fine to the inside of the
case is lined with sound dampening
material and the non pro version which
would have a solid panel on the
left-hand side instead of a window
naturally unless you inverted the
motherboard tray whatever don't worry
about it would also have sound dampening
in there although the pro version
wouldn't because again naturally it's a
window moving to the outside on the top
you have your i/o which is two USB 2.0
two USB 3.0 a mic and headphone jack
separately power and reset buttons hard
drive LED pwm controller switch so you
can have it go through the motherboard
or through the PWM controller that'd be
quiet supplies and then last but not
least is an RGB switch so with the pro
version not with the non pro version it
comes with a bunch of LED strips and I'm
sure if you got the non Pro version you
could add your own as well on the pro
version not on the non pro version at
the very top of the case there is a key
charger to charge your phone just in
case you don't want to plug it in
through USB or whatever so the
differences between the pro and the non
pro is that the pro has a window has
lights and has a key charger on the top
the non pro has no window no lights no
key charger that's the only differences
let me know what you guys think of the
dark base pro 900 in the comments down
below or on Twitter or wherever else
we're pretty easy to contact thank you
to Coursera for sending us here this
year if you want a game on the couch
with a keyboard and mouse check with a
lapdog that's pretty cool
also thanks to MSI they'll be showing
off their aigis X desktop and their MSI
GTX 1080 gaming x8 G graphics card at
the show we'll be checking them out
later on so stay tuned for that
