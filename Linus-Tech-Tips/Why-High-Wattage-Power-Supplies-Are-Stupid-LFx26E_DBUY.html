always a bad idea just due to being too
expensive
I mean sure that is of course as long as
you're not doing some asinine projects
such as seven gamers or eight gamers or
ten gamers one CPU and even then running
seven freaking graphics cards to one
hundred and forty watt TDP CPUs and a
small mountain of SSDs does legitimately
take some solid wattage your standard
gaming PC does not

video description we have a number of
videos about not needing super high
wattage power supplies but it became
even more blatantly apparent when our
massively overkill setup of a high-end
enthusiast 68 50 K and dual GTX 10 80s
drew just over a third of the wattage
well under heavy load of a standard
flagship power supply at 1200 watts what
the shipped now I know I know this isn't
a new idea as I already said and I do
have a fairly recent video on it a super
craptastic workshop video that you
actually probably shouldn't bother
watching because well it's garbage but
be quiets own Kristof cat sir has an
article on this back from 2008 when he
used to work with a non tech which is
named debunking power supply myths and
is actually a wonderful read in his
final thoughts section he notes that few
people if any need more than an 850 watt
power supply that's from 2008 components
of beginning progressively more and more
efficient this entire time and it
doesn't stop there
either power supplies have also been
getting more efficient as well with the
increasing abundance of highly rated 80
plus versions across the board
recommended power supply ratings for
various computer components have started
to react to this as well which is great
for examples oh tax crazy new amp
extreme GTX 10 ad featuring an oversized
two and a half slot cooler and ample
amounts of power sorry terrible joke it
only recommends a 500 watt power supply
for the whole system and cooler masters
power supply calculator seems to sing a
similar tune ni5 6600 k with 16 gigs of
ram at gtx 1070 and SSD hard drive a few
USB devices a 240 millimeter all-in-one
CPU cooler additional three fans and
gaming peripherals all equated to an
estimated grand total of 344 watts at
load and a recommended power supply of
394 watts but as I'm sure a few of you
are acutely aware this isn't the whole
story and I wouldn't
a 400 watt power spike for that computer
any day I just wouldn't really be
comfortable with that not only do the
capacitors within a power supply degrade
slightly over time as it ages but there
is also the efficiency curve to consider
and the overall build quality of the
power supply
each power splice efficiency curve is
more or less unique but let's use the
curve of the course our 1200 I for
example you can easily see the rise and
the fall best in the middle worst at
excessively high and excessively low
usages ideally if your power bills are
high you'd like to sit the load power of
your system at a highly efficient point
in this curve as long as that makes
sense to offset the cost of the power
supply for that particular purpose
another graph supplied by Corsair and
the reason I chose this power supply as
the example is the fan noise graph
people going for absolutely silent
systems can greatly benefit from low
power usage components because certain
power supplies are able to go into a
zero rpm fan mode below certain amounts
of wattage or usage at 30% a 1200 I
would give you three hundred and sixty
watts of zero rpm fan mode headroom
plenty enough for a 68 50 K and a GTX
1080 which is a really high-end set up
but don't use this video as an excuse to
buy a cheap crappy power supply buy a
good power supply skimping on this
component is just fundamentally a bad
idea that being said buying a 1200 watt
power supply for your system when it
will only peak at like 300 watts and you
don't care about zero rpm mode is just
lighting your money on fire there's no
point in doing that if you're worried
about your choice of power supply check
out Johnny guru power supply reviews I'm
pretty sure he's been reviewing power
supplies for longer than I've been
interested in computers in total and
that guy knows a lot alright guys if you
dislike the video because you're like I
knew all that already hit the dislike
button hit the like button if you liked
it and feel free to get subscribed check
out power supplies at Amazon and also
link to the video description is our
merch store which I think will soon
these shirts I'm not entirely sure and
the forum community which you can
discuss things like the intricate
qualities of power supply components as
you read them on Johnny guru because I'm
not going to get into that type of power
supply review nope check out this video
whoever is editing this will pick their
favorite video on any one of our three
channels actually no pickup tech quickie
video because I'm wearing the chair
