intel core i7 4770k unlocked processor
if you're a speed freak added until 3500
series SSD to your Haswell system for a
truly enthusiast class experience now I
often get asked which sound card to buy
and the answer over the last couple
years has been inevitably I decide on a
budget and then buy whatever's on our
card fits inside your budget because
it's pretty much that simple back in the
day every sound card that was a sound
card worth buying was creative and then
for a while it was AHS and tech and
nowadays it really seems like it's just
a soos is the way to go but not all of
their sound cards are built with the
same things in mind in fact they have a
couple of offerings at the same price
point around that $200 range that do
differ a little bit so today we're going
to be having a look at the Xonar Phoebus
this is the as you may or may not have
figured out based on the massive
Republic of gamers logo on the front of
the box this is the gaming oriented card
so it's not necessarily about oh well we
brought you the absolute best possible
DAC and we brought you you know
swappable op-amps for you know the music
listening audio files out there it's
more along the lines of the features
that enhance the gaming experience so
why don't we start with the card itself
physically which has a very rog look to
it as you can plainly see at least
you'll be able to once I finally get it
out of the box so it uses a PCI Express
1x interface this is the same as the
zonar STX which is actually for music
listeners maybe the better choice it has
dedicated 7.1 audio out using all
three-and-a-half millimeter jacks this
is again a more gaming oriented feature
because many audio files are going to be
using headphones that use the larger
jack style so they would have to adapt
to get down to this whereas many gamers
are using gaming headsets which use
standard three-and-a-half millimeter
jacks another thing that gamers often do
is they'll have mic and headphones and
then they'll have a separate speaker
setup that they use sometimes so that's
why it has dedicated plugs for all of
them this is in contrast to my personal
zone ARS ents which is actually a very
very very similar card
chooses a breakout cable in order to
achieve those surround those are those
surround outputs there's a link right
here so that's for the external control
box more on that in a moment and other
than that you've got what pretty
standard looking sound card so the back
of the card is a matte black PCB which
I've come to expect at this point from
high-end gaming gear then on the top of
the card we find a PCI Express power
connector this is essential for the
amp'd headphone port on this card it can
handle up to 600 ohm impedance
headphones so yeah you need more power
than can be delivered by a simple PCI
Express slot other than that speaking of
600 ohm impedance headphones there's a
Xonar Phoebus logo at the top that glows
red when you're in high impedance
headphone mode and blue when you're in
low impedance headphone mode which i
think is kind of cool and the rest of it
is covered by a simple matte black
shroud with our OG branding on it as
well as a sous branding and then some
very cool aggressive looking lines now
this actually has a functional purpose
as well as looking nice and EMI shield
does exactly what you might think it
does and reduces electromagnetic
interference by fielding it so there you
go we can remove that though by simply
removing four screws which gives us a
better look at the actual guts of this
carbon it just looks high-end it's got
all these components on it and stuff so
the processor itself is an oxygen CNI
8888 this is a slightly updated version
of the controller that's in the sense
and then for our DAC we're using ATI PCM
1796 a DAC slightly slept steps slept
down it's a sleep over there no it's not
a sleep over they're slightly steps down
versus the zone our essence STX and
speaking of things that are a step down
versus the zone our STX is what you're
going to see looking closely at this
card is that while it does use jrc 2114
op amps they are soldered so you do not
unfortunately have the option to change
them out for different op amps what op
amps basically do is they can color the
sound or they can that could be more
warm or more rich or more flat or
whatever else and some people have a
very their ears very tuned to a
preference of what they want to hear and
they like being able to swap out op amps
like you can on the essence one or the
zone our essence STX not possible on
this card it's sort of a
take-it-or-leave-it we
tuned it this way and this is how you're
going to experience it because this card
is optimized for gaming not necessarily
those disturb this discerning muted
music my screen turned off those
discerning music listeners and those
audio files and those sorts who want
that customizability also there's a
headphone amp built into this guy right
here so there's the that is a TPA 6120 a
2 headphone amp able to handle as I said
before up to 600 ohm headphones the 7.1
circuitry is completely separate from
the headphone circuitry and while it's
reasonably high-end it's not as nearly
the same extent because well there's a
lot more of it and it's deemed less
important from a gaming or even an
audiophile standpoint because you're
bound to be using probably there you go
there's your spit if out probably a
digital out to some kind of external
decoder or you're going to be using
headphones directly off of it and if
you're using something like powered
speakers they're not going to be so
high-end that you'd notice much of a
difference anyhow this brings us to the
Phoebus control pod which is man maybe
not that different from what you might
find if you have a pair of speakers that
includes one of these already but it
does have some cool functionality so it
allows you to extend your headphone and
microphone jacks meaning that you can
you know plug in short cables so some
headphones come with the breakaway
cables these days you've also got a
control pod cable there you go that goes
right there so you go ahead and plug all
these in together and they're
conveniently together lis located
locations just like that and it allows
you to do a few different things you can
adjust your volume with the knob on the
top you can mute your mic by pressing it
and then there you go you plug in your
front headphone microphone it's got a
bit of weight to it but this this my
friends is where the special sauce
happens those are two microphones and if
you were someone who was not using this
correctly you can use this as a
microphone please don't do that that's
get a real microphone but what you can
use this for is environmental noise
cancellation now I haven't used the
Xonar Phoebus yet I'm unboxing it now
but I have used their Thunder FX
external sound card and I can tell you
their environmental noise cancellation
at least on that one I'm sure it's
better on this sleep yeah thumbs up you
because what it does is it uses these
mics to listen to the environment and
then the microphone on you
headset itself to listen to you and it's
able to cancel out what these ones here
in a very very cool very effective it
works it's awesome it's actually really
really good
so that along with their zone our
software which I personally really like
that's part of what makes their sound
cards so easy for me to recommend are
what makes this sound card so easy to
recommend so the zone our software has
gotten an ro G skin I've actually used
the skin version I personally don't like
it quite as much but I'm not as used to
it because the one that I use day-to-day
is a Zen switch doesn't have the ro G
skin but this one comes with something
that no dolls and our cards do and
that's Dolby home theater d4 so this
allows you to add virtualized surround
support to things like headphones which
is from what I've read haven't tried it
yet very very effective and a definite
differentiating factor between this one
and others on our cards so there's a
graphic equalizer as well built into the
Dolby side of the software and then
there's the separate zone our software
there's two two separate applications
for it and there's also a tweak dialog
option that allows you to in movies and
games particularly enhance dialog in
here more clearly which from what I've
seen apparently actually works which is
which is very very cool and probably
part of the reason why this product has
been on the market a year already by the
time I'm actually doing this video and
hasn't been replaced in any way yet so
subjectively speaking haven't used the
card yet but it is very very similar to
the zonar Zen switch I've been using
extensively for a long period of time
and with the zone ARS ents I was never
tempted in any way to upgrade the card
personally I'm not one of those
audiophile guys who is swapping out op
amps on a regular basis for the most
tuned-in possible music listening
experience that's not me I do appreciate
good audio I do appreciate a high end
sound card and a decent pair of hands
and all of those things I mean who
doesn't appreciate a decent pair of
hands but I'm not one of those super
fussy guys so based on my experience
with the scents I can confidently
recommend the Phoebus because it has
well this additional benefit which is
nice it also looks really cool and glows
in your system which is also nice and
with some of the more gaming oriented
features such as the health the
environmental noise
translation can't underscore how
important that is enough especially in
something like a crowded LAN Hall as
well as the EAX emulation in Dolby home
theater v4 yeah very excited to try this
out don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and let me know in
the comments do you have a sound card
yet because as much as I'm talking about
a 200-dollar sound card right now a soos
has zonar cards that are like 30 40
bucks in fact they have a headphone
amped one that isn't that's under $50
and I get tweets at least probably once
a week I'll get a tweet or a message or
something like that saying hey - I
didn't try a sound card until you told
me to try one and holy crap I can't
believe I wasn't doing this before it
makes such a big difference compared to
on board unless we're talking about very
high-end onboard like what you might
find on something like a Maximus 6
formula thanks for watching guys don't
forget to subscribe and we'll see you
again next time
