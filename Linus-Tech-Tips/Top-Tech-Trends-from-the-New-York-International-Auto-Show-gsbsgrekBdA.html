New York International Auto Show not my
traditional scene but given how
determined cars seem to be to become
rolling computers on wheels with 40 even
going as far as to rebrand themselves as
a technology company it shouldn't come
as any surprise that there is a lot to
see here so let's have a look at some of
the top tech trends here at the Auto
Show
Tunnel Bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you use the internet
as though you're in one of 20 different
countries try it for free at the link in
the video description first up is phone
integration and I mean the real deal not
just a bluetooth chipset and a
microphone somewhere integrated qi
wireless charging pads were on display
in the Toyota Prius Prime and hyundai
ioniq
with honda offering upgrade accessories
to enable this functionality on key
models and Volvo evaluating it moving
into the future and Android auto and
carplay were either big selling points
or quietly swept under the rug depending
on who you talked to
against the tide BMW and Toyota
remain committed at least for now to
their in-house developed connected drive
and Entune infotainment systems while
Hyundai Volkswagen Ford Chevy Honda and
Audi have already embraced both on
models like the ionic vault and the new
a4 with Volvo leggings only slightly
behind with carplay support available
now and android auto coming later on the
s9 TT 8 most brands Ford Chevy outtie
actually pretty much you name it we're
showing off evolutionary improvements to
their phone apps to the point where
there's a base functionality set that
pretty much everyone's got your remote
lock and unlock your deal location your
car status updates maintenance reminders
battery level indicators but there's
still innovation here
Volvo's phone as a key fob functionality
stood out to us as pretty cool because
it allows your Bluetooth enabled phone
to literally act as the key to your car
and not only that but it allows you to
share it with anyone else a friend or a
family member who has the Volvo app
installed trend number two has got to be
fuel economy BMW had three plug-in
hybrids on display including the 740 II
X Drive I performance with 14 miles of
pure evey range and a 53 mile per gallon
rating which is pretty good if you
factor in the fun-to-drive this of it
but not nearly as amazing as the new
Chevy Volt which boasts an incredible 53
miles of full electric range with an
additional 367 handled by the gas engine
if you run out of juice not to mention
that there bolt electric vehicle boasts
over 200 miles of range at a price point
under 30,000 us assuming full leverage
of the available federal tax credits
damn not to be ignored though Toyota
launched the Prius prime plug-in hybrid
whose evey range of 22 miles isn't as
impressive but whose 84 mile per hour
pure electric top speed 600 mile total
range and 120 mile per gallon equivalent
C rating may make up for it Honda having
been working on fuel cell for decades
finally has something real to show for
it with the clarity fuel cell launching
this year in select markets if you can
find a refueling station Honda claims
that it fuels up in three minutes
and makes none of the weight cargo space
or performance compromises of other zero
emissions vehicles
other notable displays were Hyundais
three discrete models of the ionic a
full electric a plug-in hybrid and a
regular hybrid taking aim squarely at
Toyota's Prius lineup and Volvo s90 t8
plug-in hybrid both of which hide their
batteries either under the rear seats or
between the front seats for a lower
center of gravity and improvements to
cargo space as well as interior room oh
and Volvo also had a seven-seater
plug-in hybrid SUV boasting 14 miles of
pure electric range with another 350 on
gas
trend number threes cameras everywhere
everyone is getting geared up for
mandatory rear cameras next year and
some folks are taking it a step further
Ford showed off optional dual 180 degree
fish eyes in the front and back with
cleaning nozzles for the Explorer great
for backing out of parking stalls but
and now you've got to have like a
bird's-eye view camera stitching feature
like Chevy's bolt and volt and Volvo s90
t8 or step up your game even further if
you want to impress us BMW was showing
off a fancier 3d modeled bird's-eye view
that lets you rotate the car and view
the space around it and they're active
comfort drive which uses the
forward-facing camera to analyze the
road ahead and Priya just your
suspension OD allows easy toggling
between normal and fisheye views on
their forward and rear cameras with
bird's-eye as an added bonus on the a4
that we saw with night vision assist
thermal cameras available on the q7
which is not to say that tactically
placed cameras aren't great for more
than just parking Honda's Lane watch
camera on the clarity fuel cell shows
the passenger side blind spot in the
center a dent touchscreen whenever you
signal right nifty which I guess ties in
really closely to trend number four
active safety and assisted driving
features both of which are just
exploding right now Lane Keeping Assist
varying degrees of parking assistance
for by the way is both staying
assistance for parking and pulling out
adaptive cruise control with radar and
pre charging the brakes in dangerous
situations are everywhere but the devil
is in the details here and automakers
have quite different approaches to some
of this technology BMWs ability to
automatically navigate stop and go
traffic stops working if you take your
hand off the wheel for longer than 10
seconds Ford for example will merely
pre-charge the brakes when detecting an
obstruction while Chevy will slam the
brakes for you below 50 miles per hour
hoping to avoid or reduce the severity
of a crash outtie and BMWs systems will
auto brake below about 25 miles per hour
Honda didn't specify and Volvo's
approach is the only one that
specifically advertises the ability to
detect bicycles and this is new large
animals like moose
in addition to pedestrians and other
vehicles so depending on whether you
want a vibrating steering wheel an
audible alert a heads-up display
flashing notification or the car to rent
control from you in the event of a
problem you will need to pick not only
the make but also the model of your next
car very carefully the last couple of
mentions here didn't fall neatly into a
category but BMWs gesture control allows
volume adjustments call acceptance and
rejection as well as manipulating the 3d
view of the car by detecting hand waves
with a motion and heat sensitive
roof-mounted camera we thought that was
pretty cool and the Prius prime probably
isn't the last car that we've seen with
a massive in console touchscreen with
its 11.6 inch 1080p affair almost
entirely replacing tactile buttons
whether for better or for worse
ting-a-ling-a-ling ting-a-ling-a-ling
what's that sound must be time to tell
you guys about ting the mobile carrier
that makes sense they charge you only
for the voice and data that you use and
the average ting bill is only 24 bucks a
month but hold on a second Linus how
would I know if I would get charged $24
or $42 or 80 billion dollars well all
you got to do is head over to Linus
ENCOM and try out their savings
calculator the savings calculator lets
you input your last few bills and then
it spits out how much you would have
paid for the airtime that you used if
you were on ting sounds pretty cool
right but wait there's more ting will
actually cover 25% up to $75 of your
cancellation fee if you bail on your
existing contract and if you use our
link that's Linus ENCOM you can actually
get 25 bucks towards your bill or a
device credit so head on over there try
the savings calculator it costs nothing
until you sign up then it cost something
but probably less so thanks for watching
guys if you just like the video hit the
dislike if you liked it though like get
subscribed consider supporting us all
the usual ways amazon affiliate
up there and let me know in the comments
do you enjoy the car content from us
does it bother you that the one thing
that no one at the car show seemed to be
proactively talking about was how to
keep all of these smart features safe
we'd love to see a good discussion about
that in the comments below now that
you're done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what should I watch
next maybe check out this channel super
fun video up in the top right corner I
guarantee you it would be super and fun
and it will be on a chip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
