trying to make my ever popular law I
left my XPS out in the rain let's see if
it survived series of videos less
suspenseful or whether they just want me
to work harder to room their stuff but
whatever their motivation was they sent
over the latitude twelve rugged tablet
for the Lynas treatment and this device
has made it very clear from the moment I
first laid eyes on it that it's going to
take more than a little rain to roon its
parade
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so let's start
with the physical tour this is one
unusual tablet friend I think my wife
probably put it best when she blurted
out oh my goodness it's really heavy the
first time I handed it to her even
without the optional keyboard cover and
kickstand accessory and a secondary
battery it weighs a whopping 1.6 to kilo
grams that's over 3 pounds which might
seem kind of hilarious compared to the
iPad pro which has a larger display and
weighs almost an entire kilogram less
but I do wonder how hard the iPad would
be laughing if you dropped both of them
in the Octagon because the latitude 12
may be ugly and heavy but where it
excels is in its ruggedness the corners
are all covered in this stiff rubber
material that feels like a great balance
between strength and impact absorption
which I guess it better be since I'm
planning to do some drop testing with it
fairly shortly and the rest of the frame
of the device features a similarly
grippy textured finish that makes it
fairly easy to hold on to in spite of
its weight on the top you'll find a
microphone pinhole a slider for the
selfie camera protective cover
I mean hey with all that NSA crap going
on lately maybe that'll become a
standard feature am i right anyway
moving on
you'll also find both the tether point
and storage slot for the included soft
tipped stylus and on the right you'll
find the power button then covered by
protective flaps a micro serial port a
must for like scientific expeditions
where a lot of that equipment would look
at USB like some kind of spacemen
connector a USB 3 port for the more
modern stuff and a power input on the
bottom is the Pogoplug dock connector
that I'm using for the optional keyboard
and trackpad accessory as well as RF
pass throughs for both Wi-Fi and mobile
Internet in case you want to hook up to
beefier antennas on the left is another
mic pinhole a lone cooling exhaust port
and another flap with microSD mini HDMI
and a 4-pole 3.5 millimeter
Oh Jack then around the back holy crap
this thing has a lot of Io for a tablet
there's a smart card reader at the top
left with this placeholder in it that
has common metric to imperial
conversions the Morse codes for both SOS
and help and a guide for how to find
north then right below that is a
fingerprint reader and NFC contact point
another Pogoplug accessory contact tab
thing with mounting points around it a
super unexceptional 8 megapixel rear
camera with flash and of privacy cover
and air intake and dual hot swappable
batteries that managed an outstanding 5
and a half hours of battery life in
battery eater pro with life remaining
indicator LEDs and finally a micro SIM
slot
hidden under the rightmost battery pack
whoo moving around to the front is an
11.6 inch 1366 by 768 Gorilla Glass 3
topped matte IPS display with a glove
compatible 10-point capacitive
multi-touch interface that results in
the image being readable but certainly
not crystal clear when viewed off axis
but trades that for being Glove
compatible and being functional even in
the rain pretty cool it's accompanied by
a rotation lock volume and windows
buttons and three additional
programmable buttons below and also an
unexceptional front camera whew sounds
great Linus so I'm sure this beast of a
tablet is making up for its 2006 era
display resolution with like a quad core
i7 and 32 gigs of ram especially for
that price right actually it doesn't
it's got even more features I didn't
mention yet like a vibration motor for
notifications and GPS but when it comes
through a horsepower the latitude 12
rugged comes up short with a broad well
based core and dual core up to eight
gigs of RAM Intel HD graphics and up to
512 gigs of solid-state storage so if
you were shopping based on price to
performance the latitude 12 rugged might
end up on the short something but it
certainly wouldn't be a list of course
that's not why anyone would buy this
thing anyway so let's go punish
it it's rated at one point to two meters
of drop resistance while turned off and
at just shy of a meter while operating
blowing dust at it should not be a
problem and neither should thermal
extremes with a rated operating
temperature range of all the way from
minus 20 degrees Celsius to 63 degrees
Celsius seriously you would die of heat
exhaustion before this tablet would an
ingress protection rating of IP 65 means
that it should be able to withstand jets
of water from any direction and a bunch
of other stuff that we don't really have
the facilities to validate like what is
explosive atmosphere but even though we
couldn't run through all those tests I'm
still impressed that it still works and
by works I don't mean that it's an
amazing computing experience or anything
like the keyboard cover and kickstand
accessory that they sent me has a nice
you know strong magnetic latch and a
decent keyboard but probably the worst
touch pad I've used in the last 10 years
thanks to its use of resistive
technology which is again about glove
compatibility and not perfect tracking
under office conditions and another
issue is that like the rest of the
accessories this thing is not cheap but
with all that said it still works
so if Dells objective was to take the
fun out of my rain torture videos by
building a device that gives exactly
zero cares about anything that could
happen to it
within reason then I guess mission
accomplished
the latitude twelve rugged is a pretty
cool freakin device and on that subject
crunchyroll the site created by enemy
fans for anime fans and their sites got
all kinds of great benefits for premium
