Robot Chicken calendar we are welcoming
the new year with some sort of weird
off-color humor with various action
figures and you know models of stuff so
on the back it says we combine equal
parts old school stop motion animation
merciless parody of TV movies pop
culture and celebrity and the twisted
lunacy of co-creators and geek gods Seth
Green and Matthew Simon and you have
Robot Chicken the Duck blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah okay it's
a keyboard I mean it's not a keyboard
what am I saying I just unboxed a
keyboard so now I am unboxing a calendar
this doesn't actually belong to me it
actually belongs to one of my co-workers
I think he may or may not know who he is
but he he's Taryn and he bought this the
other day when they went on sale right
after Christmas because buying a
calendar before Christmas is seriously
like stupid unless you're buying it as a
gift because they're so expensive
okay so the first page is September
October November and December of 2009 we
have a robot lifting a clothes dryer all
right and then we have an alien in a
funky suit made of like chain mail or
something okay cool now I don't actually
watch the show so I'm not going to get a
lot of these references but I do know
that this is the weird scientist and at
the beginning in the intro and this is
the Robot Chicken okay so here we have
for January the Robot Chicken telethon
alright so and then there's one of the
creators who is laying out for us which
is very nice of him okay we have Martin
Luther King Day New Year's Day awesome
so February we have an alien answering
the telephone all right and then we have
a robot apparently making love to a
blender but that may be taken out of
context okay next we have a guy riding a
unicorn and yeah okay okay there's
nothing particularly creepy or
entertaining about that but I've heard
the show is very funny I have seen a few
of oh okay we have a raging carrot
excellent that's for April that must be
April Fool's or so actually April Fool's
Day isn't on this calendar go figure
April the first not there okay we have
the mad scientist down in the bottom
corner here and the cameraman is like
totally not looking at that from the
bottom quarter period here there you go
mad scientist okay and then we have oh
we have a some kind of gummy bear with
its foot caught in a bear trap that is
mildly amusing okay then we have him
swearing okay he's quite upset that his
foot is caught in the bear trap and then
we have the robot making love to a truck
okay or lifting it okay the cameraman
says go faster this isn't that
interesting okay chickens being
interrogated okay and then we have that
funky alien with the suit alright that's
June then July we have George Washington
I think with an American flag cape and a
musket and standing on a rock okay and
then we have a guy in a poncho that's
July and then for August which is my
birthday month we have a giraffe in
quicksand and he can't get out
uh-oh and then in the bottom we have a
burlap chicken okay in September this is
when you go back to school so we got a
guy in his school letters here and it's
a robot okay and then we have to kind of
oldies looking couple and then we have
the mad scientist with the chainsaw next
we have I don't know what this is but it
seems to be zombies zombies of other
stuff that we've seen throughout the
rest of the calendar this is the guy who
was riding the unicorn that guy right
there okay and then at the bottom we
have him again in the top hat top hats
are very fashionable family all right
then we have Dorothy from The Wizard of
Oz and it's that guy again I don't know
who that guy is but now we have the
robot making love to a gas pump okay and
then oh we have a cross between Santa
and Frosty that is actually kind of
creepy looking you should like zoom out
so you can see this whole thing it's
like yeah it's Santa eating a cookie and
drinking milk but it's Frosty the
Snowman very scary okay and then for
December we have a yet another Robot
Chicken thank you for checking out my
unboxing
the Robot Chicken 2010 calendar Happy
