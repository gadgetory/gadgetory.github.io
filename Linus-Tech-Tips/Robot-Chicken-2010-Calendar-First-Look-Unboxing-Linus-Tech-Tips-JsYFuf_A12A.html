robot chicken calendar we are welcoming
the new year with some sort of weird
off-color humor with various action
figures and you know models of stuff so
on the back it says we combine equal
parts old-school stop motion animation
merciless parody of TV movies pop
culture and celebrity and the twisted
lunacy of co-creators and geek god Seth
Green and Matthew sign Rick and you have
Robot Chicken the dark blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah okay it's
a keyboard I mean it's not a keyboard
what am I saying I just unboxed a
keyboard so now I am unboxing a calendar
this doesn't actually belong to me it
actually belongs to one of my co-workers
as you may or may not know who he is but
he he's tearin and he bought this the
other day when they went on sale right
after Christmas because flying a
calendar before Christmas is seriously
like stupid unless you're buying it as a
gift because they're so expensive okay
so the first page is september-october
November and December of 2009 we have a
robot lifting a clothes dryer alright
and then we have an alien in a funky a
suit made of like chain mail or
something okay cool now I don't actually
watch the show so I'm not going to get a
lot of these references but I do know
that this is the weird scientist and at
the beginning in the intro and this is
the robot chicken okay so here we have
for January the robot chicken telethon
alright so and then there's a one of the
creators who is laying out for us which
is very nice of him ok we have Martin
Luther King Day New Year's Day awesome
so februari we have an alien answering
the telephone alright and then we have a
robot apparently making love to a
blender but that may be taken out of
context okay next we have a guy riding a
unicorn and yeah okay okay there's
nothing particularly creepy or
entertaining about that but I've heard
the show is very funny I have seen a few
up to oh ok we have a raging carrot
excellent that's for April that must be
April Fool's or so actually April Fool's
Day isn't on this calendar go figure
April the first not there okay we have
the mad scientist down in the bottom
corner here and the cameraman is like
totally not looking at that in the
bottom quarter period here there you go
mad scientist okay and then we have oh
we have some kind of gummy bear with its
foot caught in a bear trap that is
mildly amusing okay then we have him
swearing okay he's quite upset that his
foot is caught in the bear trap and then
we have the robot making love to a truck
okay we're lifting it okay the cameraman
says go faster this isn't that
interesting okay chickens being
interrogated okay and then we have that
funky alien with the suit alright that's
june then july we have a george
washington i think with an American flag
cape and a musket is standing on a rock
okay and then we have a guy in a poncho
that's July and then for august which is
my birthday month we have a draft in
quicksand and he can't get out uh-oh and
then in the bottom we have a robot
chicken okay in September this is when
you go back to school so we got a guy in
his school letters here and it's a robot
okay and then we have to kind of oldies
looking couple and then we have the mad
scientist with the chainsaw next we have
I don't know what this is but it seems
to be zombies zombies of other stuff
that we've seen throughout the rest of
the calendar this is the guy who was
riding the unicorn that guy right there
okay and then at the bottom we have him
again in a top hat top hats are very
fashionable family all right then we
have Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz and
it's that guy again I don't know who
that guy is but now we have the robot
making love to a gas pump ok and then oh
we have a cross between santa and frosty
that is actually kind of creepy looking
you should like zoom out so you can see
this whole thing it's like yeah it's
Santa eating a cookie and drinking milk
but it's frosty the snowman very scary
ok and then for december we have a yet
another robot chicken thank you for
