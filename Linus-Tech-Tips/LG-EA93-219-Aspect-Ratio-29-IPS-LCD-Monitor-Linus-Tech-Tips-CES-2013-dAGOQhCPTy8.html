our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys and rounding out the LG booth we
have what I've specifically requested
that we be briefed on and have an
opportunity to film this is the e a 93
this is a 29 inch IPS monitor and what's
special about it is the fact that it is
more than one Linus forearm plus for
Linus fingertips in length that means we
are looking at a 21 by 9 aspect ratio
this is perfect for enjoying your fully
widescreen content without black bars so
this will be very exciting for anyone
who wants to watch just well yeah super
widescreen content on their computers
now what excites me about this is not
even just that but from a Productivity
standpoint this is a game-changer not
only can you use their virtual display
manager to split it into sort of two
17-inch equivalent screens it also
accepts dual inputs so the one right
here in front of me has taken one input
on one side from a computer and another
input on the other side from an LG
smartphone so you can actually multitask
in a way that goes beyond just using
your computer in two different ways it
uses IP an IPS panel which means that I
can't come on guys for a screen this
wide if you're not using an IPS panel by
the time you sit in front of it the
edges are gonna look off in terms of
their color TN simply wouldn't work so
also from a Productivity standpoint
something like this is again
game-changing if you use Excel a lot if
height isn't as important to you and you
work with very long spreadsheets this
could be an enormous time-saver because
you don't have to contend with the
bezels that you have to deal with
with a multi-monitor setup don't miss
any of our CES 2013 coverage and don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
