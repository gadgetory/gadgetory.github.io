I'm actually very excited about few
things sort of excite me about power
supplies however there are pretty much
all of those things included with this
particular unit this is the high current
probe platinum power supply for man tech
and why don't I just do a quick bullet
list bullet point list of all of the
things that like really excite me about
this packaging packaging this product
number one is the packaging
I love awesome packaging I unbox a lot
of stuff and this is very very shiny
love it number two is the don't worry
you won't get caught in there it's okay
number two is the seven-year Antec
warranty antic has never done a seven
year warranty before but they're pulling
out all the stops on this one they're
basically saying this will not fail and
that is also very exciting to me number
three thing that is very exciting to me
is that antic has done a lot of work to
improve their aesthetics and I'm a big
aesthetic guy when it comes to power
supplies without compromising on any of
the safety features that they believe
are so important to have in their
products and I don't say they believe
because I don't also believe so but I
think you guys catch her I'm going with
this so check this out ugly 24-pin power
connectors are a definite pet peeve of
mine and Antec has found a way around it
if I could ever find the 24 pin power
connector in here haha that they believe
will help so check this out normally a
nanotech power supply will look like a
big old mess of brightly colored wires
but they've found a compromise though
for safety reasons and tech believes
that they should continue having colors
color codes on the wires and I actually
don't disagree with them it reduces the
chance of anything being miss wired at a
factory it reduces the chance of
accidentally miss wiring something
yourself if you're sleeping your power
supply or whatever else you
want to do and yeah I mean that right
there it reduces the chance of errors so
what they've done is they've put stripes
of the appropriate colors on the
appropriate cables you see that so
there's a stripe so what that means is
that when you install this in your
system all of a sudden it looks far more
stealthy compared to the brightly
colored cables that we've seen before in
the past so we see the same thing there
you go
half and half on the CPU power connector
and look at this nice touch
they'd even oriented it so that in most
motherboards when it comes over this way
most of the colored wires will be hidden
because they're on the inside even if it
goes this way very nice
nice touch ntek good that you guys
thought of that okay so that was my
quick bullet point but I guess we'll
have to like kind of back up here and
and start doing the actual proper proper
unboxing so here there we go
and back to the outside of the box oh
yes beautiful box
94% max efficiency means that compared
to a non eighty plus power supply you
could see up to twenty five percent
savings although if we're talking
compared to like an 80 plus gold power
supply it's a much smaller number just
so you guys are aware Antec power
supplies are all rated for continuous
power that means you could literally run
at a thousand watts day-in day-out for
seven years and an tech says it will not
fail full cable management yes this is a
fully modular power supply which is a
first for an tech as well over here they
actually calculate compared to a non
80-plus compared to an 80 plus compared
to a high efficiency 80 plus how much
money can actually be saved on a yearly
basis in dollars as well as in euros
compared to blah blah blah so they have
a formula here so you can actually check
that out here I'll hold it still so you
guys can see it really well and do the
math for yourself see how much an
efficient power supply could save for
you okay continuous power guaranteed a
thousand watts 80 plus platinum up to
94% efficient save money power and money
sixteen pin socket yeah we'll talk more
about that later the 28 pin motherboard
socket 135 millimeter fan high current
rails a hundred percent 12 volt k
yap-yap multipy
see 6 pcs for concealed you know what
we'll cover all this later uh oh yeah
this this little chart some guys like to
see that so yes 12 for 12 volt rails all
of them rated for a maximum of 40 amps
so what that means is that antic is
combining the best of both worlds by
including all of the appropriate safety
protections and I mean all of the metric
is big into certifications as well as
doing things by the book when it comes
to power supplies and I say this because
I actually believe it they really do
they never skip out on something so they
combine that with so the safety of
multiple rails with the appropriate
protections with the convenience of
having high current rails which means
you can kind of hook things up
willy-nilly and you are very very
unlikely unless you some I mean give you
pretty yeah you pretty much couldn't
trip the over current protection on a
given rail by hooking it up to a normal
PC system if you hook it up to some kind
of load tester or something that's a
different story and that's kind of yeah
that's kind of on your own sort of hands
if something goes wrong at that point in
time so included accessories we've got
an included power cable which is a beefy
power cable we have a little product
overview sheet that comes with it okay
we've got a bunch of modular cables but
we'll get into those more later we've
got haha they've included black screws
nice touch as well as a couple little an
tech cable management cords core I
shouldn't say cords I should say cable
management ties okay just a sec let me
just see if I missed it you know let's
start looking at the power supply unit
itself so on the back we find sort of
the industry standard honeycomb mesh you
guys won't be able to see this but if
you look inside the power supply they've
actually completely eliminated wires
from their design so everything inside
this power supply is using solid links
that means there's less soldering to be
done so once again there's less room for
inefficiency and sorry guys slick is
sick and less room for any kind of an
error during the manufacturing process
so that is it said there you can
actually see a couple of the big solid
links back there very cool so that's a
ground I can actually see the label on
it can you
see that okay it's that silver one
that's kind of like there okay okay as
long as you guys can see so we've got a
hundred and thirty five-millimeter
double ball bearing fan so that's gonna
provide quiet cooling I already
mentioned the honeycomb on-off switch
okay on the side haha and tech has
figured out aesthetics that looks sharp
that looks really good we are not
looking at like racing stripe power
supply bang going on note we have a very
very clean looking side with just a
bright one bright yellow axon I don't
mind as long as we don't have a bunch of
bright yellow accents and the whole
thing looks like a bumble bee no this
looks really really good very sharp
looking fire supply okay we've got one
label on here which actually outlines a
bunch of the bunch of the safety stuff
as well as giving you the general specs
of the power supply now let's get into
the fully modular interface so the fully
modular interface has a number of things
about it that are actually very
interesting let's start with the
motherboard connection so the
motherboard connection goes a little
something like this one here so that's
your traditional 25 right there then we
have an additional one of these now why
would we have that you might ask and the
answer is because an Tek is anticipating
the possibility that there could be some
kind of a motherboard socket change and
they want to make sure that their
motherboard connector will be compatible
with it so they have built in the
flexibility in the capacity to change
the motherboard connector to something
that is higher than 24 pins very cool so
that modular connector is something
you'd probably have to purchase but at
least it would be available without
upgrading your expensive 80 plus
platinum power supply if you wanted to
upgrade some of your other components
what else we got going on here the next
thing we have is here we go I actually
want to find oh this is kind of neat
okay so PCI Express connectors here we
go
antek has built in with their modular
system 16 16 pin
modular connectors so we've got two six
plus two s that run off an individual
brick of these or check this out guys
we can also run individual ones with
these low-profile individual banks of
eight pin connectors with these
low-profile connectors that can actually
be installed side by side without any
difficulty so check this out we can go
here and then we can take another one
maybe we need so yeah so we need an
eight pin and then maybe we have another
graphics card running in our system for
PhysX so we need some more some more six
pin or eight pin connectors so we'll go
ahead and oh no that's okay well
whatever I can use this one so this is a
four plus four so we have now plugged
our motherboard power connectors into
each other it doesn't have the usual
access around the outsides so this gives
us a ton of flexibility in terms of
which rails we want to use for which
connectors so we've got 12 volt rail one
12 volt rail two 12 volt rail three four
very very very cool
okay so I'll flex from the most flexible
modular interface pretty much possible
even if they change the graphics card
interface all ntek has to do is say okay
you guys want to agree to the latest
graphics card we'll just release a
slightly wider or slightly more
different configuration of these and you
know you'll have somewhere to plug it
into very handy okay what else we have
here on modular cables I guess I should
just cover what we have included so this
guy right here is a modular three SATA
connector okay we have how many of these
one two three of those okay then we have
a couple with four pin peripheral
connectors one that has a floppy built
onto the end and one that doesn't and
then finally we have up to six PCI
Express graphics card connectors
available with this power supply so each
of these includes 2 6 plus 2's 2 6 plus
2's and then the one that I installed
already before with 2 6 plus 2's and how
in the world have they done this hold on
a minute
oh they've included a few a couple
four kinds of 6+2 so these are designed
to go to one graphics card and
interesting off a single cable and then
if you want to run two separate go for
whatever reason they get okay they give
any options they've given you the option
to either run it this way or have them
run side by side connected like this so
they've included both kinds of cables
there you go so I hold on a second guys
so two things I missed guys one is that
it uses all high performance Japanese
caps that are capable of providing their
full output even under very high
temperatures so unrealistic
well I guess I shouldn't say unrealistic
I mean the inside of a computer could
reach you know forty degrees I guess if
you live somewhere really hot and then
the inside of your computer is hotter
you know forty to fifty degrees
so either way this will provide a
thousand watts of output and the other
thing is that it is capable of
delivering all 1,000 Watts from the
12-volt rails so yes no matter how
graphics card heavy your system or other
components they rely directly on the 12
volt rail you will be able to power it
with this power supply without running
out of juice so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of what I think is
basically the cream of the cream antics
