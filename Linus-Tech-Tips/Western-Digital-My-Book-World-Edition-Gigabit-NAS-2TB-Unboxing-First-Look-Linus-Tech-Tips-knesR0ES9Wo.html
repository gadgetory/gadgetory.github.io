book world edition so this is a network
hard drive or an ass network attached
storage this is a tube terabyte drive so
it's a single three and a half inch two
terabyte drive in there you can do
backup and storage for all your
computers and it connects to a network
router it's thirty percent more
efficient than standard systems so
claims WD and let's see what else they
have to say for themselves okay that's
just showing the unit itself we're going
to check that out when we actually open
the box alright so you've got automatic
backup automatic and continuous back
I've never mind automatic backup share
so you can add centralized storage for
everyone to save and share music photos
videos and files on your home network
okay it's an ass so that's what it does
access so you can retrieve files from
anywhere anytime even when your computer
is off okay that pretty much goes along
with it being an ass and hey this is
good you can play movies and music on
your TV through your xbox 360
playstation 3 or digital media adapter
so here they have a little chart of how
your network will look when you have one
of these so you got your router here you
got your computer here you got your
wireless computers here including pc and
mac there is your my book world edition
and then here's a game console with a
television and you can use the USB port
to add more storage so you can plug in
like another western digital external
hard drive just directly into the my
book world edition and increase the
storage automatic them cool alright so
two terabyte gives you up to eight
hundred and eighty hours of DVD quality
movie 500,000 mp3s or 571 thousand JPEGs
and those would be big JPEGs too i mean
if you're storing small.jpg I mean that
would be more like on the order of
millions all right here we go so easy
set up three simple steps plug the drive
into your router insert the CD into your
computer use easy discovery tools to
recognize the drive on your computer's
okay well Nazis ago let's open this
thing up and have a look at it
it's white you know what they say rights
the new black actually apples moved onto
aluminum so maybe white isn't cool
anymore okay so here's a little manual
about your WD product systemvue making
it any how to use it with leopard and
tiger all right there is a software
installation CD and I'm going to
actually use that all right here's a
support numbers and next we have did you
know you can update the firmware over
the Len right that's good to know all
right let's open this thing up this is
quite yeah this could probably hold two
drives inside actually I might have been
mistaken saying it was one two terabyte
drive I'll make you one terabyte drive
here is a power adapter right fairly
standard faith next we have an ethernet
cable presumably is at least cat 5e so
it'll run a gigabit speed goes back in
there let's have a look that's in my
book world edition which is sealed yeah
I get to break another seal all right
got it really does add to the unboxing
experience the more unpackaging and
unboxing you can do the better all right
well there's a very very shiny WD logo
on the side right there is shiny shiny
white at the front you've got a little
not sure if that's a window or just a
grey grey bar and then on the other side
you have another shiny WD logo on the
bottom you've got four little rubberized
feet so it's meant to sit like this my
keys ok so it's meant to sit just like
that it's not going to slip because it
has rubberized feet and on the back very
simply you've got a power switch at USB
port and a Gigabit Ethernet port there's
a little hard reset as well as your
power in ok now i'm going to try
something here i don't know if this is
going to work so i'm not going to
televise it so to speak
hold on and try and get it open because
someone told me how to do it but I don't
know if I'm doing it right here or not
I'm not doing it right okay forget it so
inside we see one hard drive and then
lots of room for our ventilation and
other electronics so you I don't know I
don't know how you can see this but the
drive is right here there's lots of
electronics which are powering the
backplane here add the i/o and then yep
all of these are just straight through
vents where you can completely see the
hard drive so it is passively cooled
that means that if it's it's a little
bit up off the table which it will
because of these feet you're going to
have air just naturally flowing down
from the bottom and then up through the
top and then from the back because of
the heat generated by the components
inside so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the my book world edition
two terabyte network hard drive from
western digital</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
