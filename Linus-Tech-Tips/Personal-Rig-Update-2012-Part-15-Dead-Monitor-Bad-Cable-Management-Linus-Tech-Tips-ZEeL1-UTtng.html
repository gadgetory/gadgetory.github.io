this will be the saddest of all of the
personal rig updates so before we go any
further I finally got it pretty much
done there's still a couple small things
I haven't finished bleeding out the loop
and yeah mostly that we're pretty much
there I need to reformat my OS and stuff
like that because this is like a year
outdated at this point haven't used it
in a really long time so I actually had
my 30-inch monitor here in the room
while I was working on the rig I don't
remember why it was down here I remember
why it was down here we were probably
running benchmarks on it yeah we were
running benchmarks on it so it was down
here in this room it was just kind of
here and Rumble really wanted some
attention and he was you know just kind
of being a brat rubbing up against
everything jumping up on everything he
jumped up on my 30 inch monitor and it
fell right here and she whacked this
thing now when it was powered off it
still looked absolutely perfect so right
in the center there where it got hit
there's not a single mark but I powered
it on to test whether my rig worked and
I was greeted by this so my Samsung 305
T plus my 2560 by 1600 monitor that I
actually just recently tested and found
out will work at 75 Hertz with a
supported Nvidia graphics card and I was
really excited to try that out is dead
so I have to figure out on my monitor
situation sometime over the next little
bit here I'm going to check with Paul
from from new egg TV and see how he
likes that yah mikaze leonidas that he
got see if he likes it and we'll go from
there anyway I might as well show you
guys my horrendous okay this is probably
the worst cable management you've ever
seen
I decided by the time I was getting to
the close to the
into the build I was like you know what
forget it I'm not going to put quite the
same sort of care and attention to
detail into the cable management as I
originally intended so things got a
little crazy all up in here
so the things that I'm still going to do
you can see this just runs off to
nowhere this is the USB connector for
the key balancer which is my smart fan
speed controller so this I only have to
plug in to program it so I'm just going
to leave it here and then I can plug it
in to program it and then just take it
out and leave it back here this is for
the UV area the UV cathode that's in the
t-virus okay you don't have to see the
inside they don't get to see that yet
I'm going to do a final update when it's
like done done also because I didn't
have as much room with my cable
management holes as I had hoped because
a lot of it got taken up by these SATA
connectors which I was planning
originally to hide sort of down here but
it didn't really end up working that way
so instead they come through here
they're managed back here and then they
go into all these drives because I took
up a lot of my cable management room I
was only able to run a couple power
connectors up here so I think I only
have a single three molex connector
coming up here and it's powering
everything so I had to fashion myself
some random adapters so this is like a
molex to left angle theta and molex and
then I used some of the phobia quad SATA
splitters to to molex to power all eight
of the eff 120 SandForce drives that are
running off the LSI controller inside
normally I'm pretty good about oh yeah
the same thing like running all of the
fans so there's two fans in the front
four on the bottom two in the top two at
the back and they all have to somehow
plug into four fan connectors on the T
balancer which this is the only really
reasonable place to hide it so that
ended up being a bit of a nightmare as
well and I could fashion custom cables
but I just got to the point where I was
tired and I wanted to have a gaming rig
again normally I'm really good about
this and I end up with a loop that's
very easy to bleed but my loop is as you
might or may not be able to hear got
quite a few air bubbles in it so I'm
going to have to play around with the
angles of the case
little bit and I get that bled out so
I'd this barely closes guys like barely
closes and I can barely get the side
panel back off so once it's done and
it's closed I want it to pretty much be
done one of the other things that was a
real nightmare to get done was getting
this 3/8 tubing over the d5 pump as well
as the half-inch barbs that I have on my
thermal chill rat I also still have to
add some zip ties I mean I don't think
these are going to leak look how
stretched they are but it's always you
know better safe than sorry for stuff
like that all the not-quite individually
but two cables per sleeve cables go here
and I want to I want to tie them up a
little bit just get them into bunches
somewhat because you can see them
through the mid plate on the other side
I didn't get a custom mid plate so
that's the last thing that I want to
change on the back it's going to be
really quiet once I get it sort of
dialed in with the t balancer but there
you go so we're close and there's my
there's my horrendous cable management
you guys are going to be surprised at
how tidy the other side looks when you
see how awful it looks in the back here
but I've never really I've never been
really been one of those guys who puts a
lot of attention in detail into the
stuff that no one's ever going to see
even though I feel like I probably
should especially with some of the
awesome build logs that are going on in
the - tech tips forum you guys are you
guys are making me feel bad about taking
a year to finish this monstrosity but
anyway I pretty much have a gaming rig
again except I no longer have a monitor
and that's my personal rig update and
I'll add that and as always don't forget
