Corsair obsidian 350d micro ATX case
exceptional expansion and cooling
flexibility for compact high performance
PCs visit Corsair comm / obsidian to
learn more welcome to my unboxing of the
replacement for the gtx 680 this is the
gtx 780 and you guys won't be able to
but get a box quite like this but the
contents of yours will be very very
similar the gtx 780 is the second
graphics card to use the gk110 GPU this
is the same one that's used in the
geforce gtx titan and the same one
that's used in the tesla GPUs that power
the most powerful supercomputer in the
world the titan so what I find inside
here is a special edition collectible
sticker which may or may not actually
come with your retail card and I also
don't find any of the accessories that
would normally come with a retail card
either so normally you'd have some molex
to PCI Express adapters and some driver
disks and all that kind of stuff
this contains absolutely nothing so
don't worry too much about that because
the part that we're interested in more
than anything else is this guy right
here and you might be noticing some
other similarities to the Titan already
because this is one secksy graphics card
now the GTX Titan when it launched was a
bit of a strange skew because it didn't
even follow the normal numbering scheme
Nvidia basically came out and said this
does not fit into our regular product
stack so we're just going to call it
Titan because it performs way better
than anything else we have but it comes
with a significant price premium the GTX
780 takes that technology and brings it
down to a price point that's more in
line with a regular geforce card like
what we're used to seeing in the past so
you can see here i've illustrated on the
table kind of how this works the gtx 780
is almost as fast as a titan has most of
the same table has almost all the same
technology and is significantly faster
than something like a 680 about 35%
faster not only that but there's a
couple new things that in videos rolling
out so the GeForce experience which has
been in beta for a long time now is
going to be released wholesale it'll
come by default installed by default
with your latest driver download that
means you'll get automatic driver
downloads
and you'll get suggested settings for
popular games to make sure that you're
getting the most out of the hardware
you're using not only that but there's
going to be some other cool features
coming in GeForce experience such as
shadow play shadow play uses the h.264
encoder that's built into your GPU
to automatically record up to 20 minutes
of previous gameplay for you to cut
together and make gameplay videos what's
neat about it is that it comes with
about a 5 percent performance hit
compared to running something like fraps
which has huge files and potentially a
big performance hit and the files are
already compressed so they're much
smaller to deal with you don't need a
huge beefy storage subsystem so it's
really cool to see where Nvidia is going
because I know a lot of game streamers
who are investing in dedicated hardware
for game streaming when it might just be
a matter of buying a GeForce GPU to
record your let's plays or gameplay
videos or who knows I'm not promising
features and video is going to deliver
but let's see what they do with that
very cool little bit of tech the 780
really is intended to leave single GPU
competition in the dust but do so
quietly efficiently and it uses a dual
slot form factor so unlike some of the
non-reference cards that were likely to
see it won't take up unnecessary space
and it'll be compatible with 3-way or
four-way SLI now all along the top of
the card you can see the two sli
connectors that are going to give you
that compatibility the illuminated
geforce gtx logo that you can control in
software and a 6 pin and 8 pin PCI
Express connector on the back of the
card you see DisplayPort HDMI and two
DVI ports with full support for NVIDIA
surround plus an auxiliary display and
on the bottom of the card it uses PCI
Express 3.0 16x for the fastest
connectivity on the back of the card we
see some more of the Titan roots of this
particular graphics card because it uses
the same PCB design as the Titan see
that except ah there's ran missing so on
the back here you can see solder points
for the other three gigs of memory that
would be on a Titan which has six gigs
of RAM whereas the GTX 780 has three
gigs of six gigahertz gddr5 lengthwise
the GTX 780 is exactly the same as the
Titan so there you go there's the two of
them side-by-side how sexy does that
look
which makes it slightly longer than a
GTX 680 so you can see that little
difference there and slightly shorter
than a Radeon 7970 because it's got that
extra little bit of plastic shroud at
the end of it there just like the GTX
Titan the card is a marvel of industrial
design oh it's so beautiful
I mean the aluminum and the fins and the
just the fact that GPUs come with metal
coolers now when you pay hundreds of
dollars for a graphics card and it
really feels like something solid and
weighty and just absolutely gorgeous in
your hand I mean that combined with the
fact that the GTX logo on the top is
illuminated and you can control that
making it pulsate or you can change the
intensity levels according to things
like GPU power consumption so when
you're in games it'll be more intense
when you're not in games it'll be less
intense makes it a very very cool
premium feeling product to own that goes
beyond just frame rates
now speaking of frame rates especially
in SLI the GTX 780 compared to the
competition from the red team does
deliver a smoother experience I'm not
going to cover it in fold up now but if
you do a quick Google search for frame
rating you'll get a lot of information
out there that might be a little bit
confusing so I'm going to give you a
basic overview it's not all just about
frames per second anymore it's about the
consistency of the frames per second how
long was each frame on the screen that
determines whether the image appears to
stutter and or whether it appears to be
smooth and in videos drivers cooperate
with the hardware that they've built
into their cards to make the experience
smoother particularly in multi way
configurations because of its kepler
lineage the GTX 780 is extremely power
efficient but because it's still such a
powerful graphics card it's going to
require at least a 600 watt power supply
according to Nvidia now I know from
personal experience you can get away
with less than that but make sure you're
using something that is a good quality
lower than that power supply
realistically anything about 450 to 500
watts of it's an extremely well-built
power supply will be able to handle
something like a GTX 780 it inherits
some other really cool technology from
the Titan as well most importantly GPU
boost 2.0
now the old GTX 688 sort of offensive to
call it old I guess but the GTX 680 had
GPU boost which allowed the GPU to
overclock itself in response to the fact
that it wasn't consuming as much power
as nvidia set for it as a power target
you could turn that power target up a
little bit but this also always felt
like a bit of a weird relationship to me
because the thing that kills a GPU from
overclocking is heat and voltage so the
fact that GPU boost an overclocking tool
didn't respond to temperature was weird
to me GPU boost 2.0 is inherited from
the Titan and responds to temperature
voltage clock speed and power so it can
do all kinds of cool stuff you can say
okay
I'm not comfortable with the 80 degree
target that Nvidia sets by default I
want my GP to run at 70 degrees it'll
dynamically turn its clock speed and
voltage down in order to not go above 70
degrees then you can say you know what
I'm comfortable with a higher
temperature I mean I'm okay with 90
degrees and it'll turn itself up in
terms of what the power consumption it
allows and the clock speed and voltage
that it allows making it actually run
faster if you say you're okay with it
being hotter and it's a water coolers
delight which is very very cool so you
slap a water block on this thing tell it
any temperature any power any anything
is okay I'll give it all the voltage go
for it and the card will allow itself to
be at maximum clock speed all the time
and they'd integrated something new in
the software they're doing something
called limiting factors where it'll give
you a little indicator next to your
power or your temperature or whatever
else or your voltage that says hey
you've reached the max for this one this
is the one holding the card back from
overclocking anymore so it's no longer
guesswork so what is the GTX 780 with
2,304 cuda cores a 384 bit bus three
gigs of memory all the connectivity that
you can pretty much wanted am an
extremely high-end card and coming in at
a significantly lower price point than
the titan it's basically the premium
ultra uber high-performance card that
makes more sense than something like a
titan but is well still ultra high
performance an uber and overclockable
and all that stuff I mean you can even
overclock your display using the Nvidia
software thank you for checking out this
unboxing and first
at the GTX 780 let me know in the
comments if you liked our new style
which includes a little bit more glamor
footage of the card and close-ups and
cool stuff like that and as always guys
