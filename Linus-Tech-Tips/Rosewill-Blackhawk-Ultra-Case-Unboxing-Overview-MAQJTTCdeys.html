welcome to my unboxing and first look at
the blackhawk ultra from Roseville the
case that is actually almost the size of
a grown man at least a smallish and
grown man like the one you see before
you so we're going to go ahead and slice
this bad boy open Roseville includes
almost no information about the
Blackhawk itself on the outside of the
box so you can see that it's just a
plain black box this is their flagship
case and fits pretty much anything
according to their well according to
everything that I already know about
this case which is some wow it's heavy
okay so Roseville claims the gross
weight is around eighteen point six
kilograms with the net weight being
sixteen point six kilograms so folks
that add a conversion of about 2.2
kilograms per pound is about 35 pounds
empty and you can see that I'm actually
going to run into oh I almost ran into a
clearance issue with the ceiling just
removing the box from the case so you
initially see a big box for a case and
you go yeah but the case inside couldn't
actually be that big for the Blackhawk
ultra it it just is it just actually is
they're using an extremely high quality
foam which I love to see check this out
more than an inch of soft durable closed
cell foam around every side which is
great their feet sit in little things
here so they're not going anywhere this
is expensive foam guys I cannot I cannot
overstate that it costs Rosewell money
to put foam like that around their case
and protect it in the event of shipping
however I understand why they're doing
it because with a heavy large chassis
like this especially once you start to
load components inside it here's the the
other one especially once you start to
load components inside it the risk of
something being damaged in shipping
increases a lot compared
two smaller cases alright so here we go
the Blackhawk ultra which includes all
of the cooling options so we'll start
with you know what I'm going to remove
all this plastic and then we'll be back
in a moment
okay well that actually didn't take as
long as I thought it was one solid piece
of plastic which as someone who opens up
a lot of products I actually appreciate
because it's frustrating when there's
like a billion different tiny little
strips of plastic that you can like peel
off with your nail and you try not to
actually scratch the finish on the
product itself so the front of the case
pretty bare I like that I like a clean
look they've also gone with a mesh that
has kind of a finer mesh behind it so
you're not going to be too worried about
a ton of dust getting pulled into the
case by the front air intakes they've
got four or five and a quarter inch bays
one of which has a three and a half
inches yep I'll be back in a moment oh
there it is damn right let's take one of
which has a three and a half inch
adapter in it so you could put in like a
card reader or something else like that
so this is actually intended to be
mounted from the back so we're just
going to go easy on at this time so that
you can get a better pressure mount
anyway so that's for a three to 1/2 inch
device in the front the sides of the
front here are sort of a glossy plastic
that I wish was matte looking at the
case you know if it was for my own
personal use however it's at least not a
super fingerprint attracting black so
you can see even though I'm touching it
here many cases will it be a greasy
disgusting mess immediately and
especially things like routers have you
ever actually like tried to wipe a
fingerprint off a router you go you take
your shirt you lipe it off and you're
like oh now it's covered in micro
scratches fantastic this doesn't do that
so at least it's a good glossy plastic
for what that's worth on this side we
find a 120 or 140 millimeter fan note on
the back of the motherboard tray this is
great from other boards that do have
like heat sinks and cooling components
or even power phases on the back of the
board itself so that's really cool to
see included and on the top of the case
which I have no idea how I'm going
show to you guys here we go maybe we'll
just later fall right ah there's our IO
so while whopping 4 USB 2 2 USB 3
headphone microphone reset power this is
kind of cool because so many times you
see motherboards with like a ton of USB
2 headers and you're like ok that's fine
what are you gonna plug those into
exactly well you're going to plug them
into this case so there you have it as
well let's check that out that dock
right there could be used for either
three and a half inch or a two and a
half inch drive and it's aw it's a
little hot swappable dock so you just
check your drive in there and you can
use it for sort of mass storage without
actually having a portable enclosure so
it allows you to use the native SATA
interface for maximum possible transfer
speeds on this side you find that this
case is all about
the cooling so there's a 230 millimeter
fan there but check this out you can put
up to death that the 9 120 millimeter
fans on the outside of this side panel
which is sort of ridiculous wall of fans
I guess you have to have somewhere to
put those weird 9 by 120 millimeter
rating you know I don't know if you
could mount I bet you could probably get
a mount it that'd be kind of cool I
don't know if you'd get a fan on every
slot just because of internal clearance
but whatever still be cool look how big
this thing is like it makes me look like
a some kind of like homunculus alright
power supply mount in the top water
cooling grommets all over the entire
back I've actually never seen one
actually implement an external water
cooling system though so I think these
have a dubious value 120 millimeter or
140 millimeter fan in the back it comes
to the 140 10 PCI Express slot so you
can fit any kind of XL ATX form factor
even the longest nine slot ones with a
dual slot card in the bottom you've got
another power supply mount this one has
a foam piece right here which we'll
check out once we open it up whereas the
top one looks like oh yeah it does too
so that will help dampen noise a little
bit there on the top of the case you
find more grills more
- it's all about cooling up here as well
so we're going to open it up and find
out exactly what kinds of fans are in
there but it's a more open mesh and then
a much finer mesh so if you did decide
to use this as an intake which isn't
necessarily the way I'd recommend using
them then you could you could not worry
about bringing too much dust into the
case that way that looks like an 80 mil
fan belt bear just because on that other
power supply plate but yeah let's go
ahead and check out the bottom of the
case oh my legs on the bottom we find ah
I believe there's a fan filter on the
bottom somewhere but at any rate there's
more mesh and this really feels like it
can be removed yeah I think it can so
there's there's yeah there we go maybe
you're supposed to remove it I don't
even know let's remove it anyway Dooku
due to voyage of discovery time it's my
favorite thing about this channel
voyages of discovery where we're just
not really sure if we're supposed to do
things what we do it anyway yeah there
you go that's a filter it's probably
supposed to remove I have no idea I'm
going to get that back in but whatever
rubber feet on the bottom keep it from
going anywhere when you don't want it to
mind you with how much this thing weighs
I don't think it's going anywhere if you
don't want it to and let's go ahead and
open it up so the side panel mounts with
the the classic little latches and
you've got rubber grommets here that are
going to prevent unnecessary vibration
on the mesh side panel from the fans
that are mounted here it should be noted
that the side panel does have a fair bit
of flex you can see that it's hard to
avoid that when you have such a large
mesh window so that doesn't give as much
support a solid metal and when the panel
is so large in general but I mean one
strategy that you can use if you do have
any vibration of the side panel that
I've used in the past is a little bit of
blue tack up here here down here down
here down here and that will keep it
from vibrating against the case so if
you do run into trouble then you can do
that I'm not I'm not saying that you
will but to 140 millimeter fans here on
the other side of the hard drive cages
that looks like
to 140 millimeter fans at the front of
the hard drive cages this is a cool
configuration because you see a lot of
cases that have fans right at the front
and at the back of the of the hard drive
mounts and the reason for that is
because these are extremely airflow
restrictive there's actually not a lot
of space I don't know if you can see
that but between the heart you have to
reinforce these because they're going to
be full of what is one of the most
heaviest component the most heaviest one
of the heaviest components of your
system so if you actually fill this
thing up with really ten oh yeah with
ten three and a half inch hard drives
you would have a serious situation if
this wasn't strong enough and it flexed
and your hard drives all fell out so you
can't leave huge gaps so what they've
done is they've used a push-pull
configuration to actually manage to move
some air through this keeping your
drives cool as well as providing more
cool air to the rest of your system
these are using a very thick steel
construction so you can see there's
almost no flex to them whatsoever and
then they're using a rubber grommet it
melt as well so that should reduce
vibration as well as noise from your
drives assuming you're using mechanical
drives with SSDs and obviously not make
any difference inside here things are
just kind of ridiculous I love this so
this is this is appropriate they include
not one but two eight pin piece eight
pin CPU power extensions so you could
probably put them together but I think
what they really intend is if you're
using a super high end motherboard like
something like an EVGA sr2 or SRX or
something like that
you can actually extend both of your
eight pin connectors to make sure that
they both reach so that's cool
comes with wheels which is again
appropriate especially with the kind of
systems that some people will be putting
in a case like this little locking
wheels are very appropriate it'll
otherwise be quite difficult to move
around there are some looks like about
five black cable ties in there that you
can use for cable managing your system
and it comes with one of the largest
bags of screws I think I've ever seen
any case come with ever and I think a
big part of the reason is check out all
these huge fan screws see that these are
the biggest head screws I think I've
ever seen full of it so
there's 100 bajillion of those to
correspond to be 100 bajillion fans that
you can mount in this chassis alright
more features inside so we've got a
large CPU kado but honestly not that
large given the size of the of this
motherboard tray but think about it this
way guys an ATX board is actually going
to go from here down to here that's how
big an actual amount you know what I'm
going to go get one we'll be back in a
second so here's what a normal ATX
motherboard I brought an Intel board
because these are going to be a sort of
dinosaur soon that's what a normal ATX
board is going to look like in this case
so it'll support pretty much any
motherboard out there look at that you
can get form factors all the way over to
here I believe it's sports hptx but
here's what this is just for lulz this
is what ITX which is the sort of the
smallest mainstream board form factor
will look like in here so the CPU cut
out alone will actually be wider than an
ITX board so that's one PCI Express
expansion slot so XL ATX it usually
refers to boards that are longer than
normal so they'll still be about this
width but can go down to about here and
then EA TX will be about here and there
are maybe a touch longer than that I
think somewhere over here and then you
can go all the way way over here if you
want
so cable management this is kind of neat
rather than having these bang around
inside the case they're secured with a
little velcro strap here you've got USB
three for the front USB 2 for the front
more USB 2 for the front front panel
audio molex to power that that SATA Bay
up there as well as a SATA cable that
you can plug into your motherboard and
finally your front panel connectors for
power reset and all of that other good
stuff the case doesn't have a built-in
fan controller but what it does have
that I think is kind of cool
are a couple of little fan hub station
things so you can plug five fans into
each of them and this is just a
convenient power redistribution sort of
method I wish I'd I wish it was a little
bit I wish it was a little bit more
cleverly implemented though because some
kind of a speed control built into the
Power Distribution hub would be great
and the other thing is particularly
this one looks like it's going to be an
issue to plug a molex connector in here
without having clearance issues with
this fan so there will be a little bit
of kajigger that'll go on in order to
actually finish a build in this case
cable management holes I wish as well
we're a little bit a little bit cleverer
because they've got quite a small hole
here so you can take some of your cables
up through here so it's going to be your
24 pin your 8 pin your a couple of 6
pins for your graphics cards and then
that's pretty much going to be full by
the time you also bring up you know
there's your motherboard connectors and
stuff like that so I wouldn't have
minded seeing this whole space down here
open to bring cables up because it's
it's a one-to-one relationship at some
point right so if you've got all of
these holes that means that it all had
to come out again somewhere else and
there isn't really enough space for that
so there's that same same thing here so
if the normal bother boards going to be
about this width you're going to have to
run your SATA cables away from the board
all the way out to here in order to hide
them and bring them back around to the
to the hard drive cages
there's your tool free mounting
mechanism for your five and a quarter
inch base you don't have to use it
though there's mounting holes behind it
and two 230 millimeter fans adorn the
top of the case neither of which are
plugged into these power distribution
hubs so again there's going to be a
little bit of configuration that goes on
before you can finish with your your
system setup motherboard tray I would
have liked to see it a little bit more
stiff but by the time you actually load
components on it I think some people
make too much make too much of the
strength of a motherboard tray being a
huge deal because especially once you
throw a board on it it actually does
stiffen up a fair bit so we're going to
go ahead and pull the other side panel
off here all right see how much room we
got for cable management because if the
intention is to mount a massive system
with all the fixin's then they better
have enough room for massive cables with
all the fixin's so you got probably
about an inch of space back here it cuts
off a little bit near the bottom but
that's fine you shouldn't be running any
cables there anyway and there should be
plenty of space to run things like here
here's an example SATA cable you could
run like an actual bundle of SATA cables
probably about four thick by the time
you run out of space between this and
the edge of the side panel here lots of
here we go huh maybe not as many as I
actually okay yeah no there's a fair
number of them so lots of mounting
points so these little anchors these
loops right here where you can route
cables more permanently there's there's
enough of them I'd say to bring
everything over here keep it nice and
tidy bring your 24 pin up so you can see
they thought of that as well as to
secure your eight pin in the correct
place so this will run across the back
of the board here that 140 millimeter
fan was going to go right on the back of
the motherboard tray there and other
than that the other side of the case is
fairly nondescript so I think that
pretty much wraps it up thank you for
checking out this unboxing and first
look at the Blackhawk Ultra from
Roseville don't forget to subscribe for
this tech tips from boxing's reviews and
other computer videos and I mean here's
a fun challenge for you guys
how many ITX systems could you actually
fit in here 1 2 3 now there's a little
Ashley hold on there's one more thing
there's a little note here if your power
supply is equipped with the single fan
you have two ways to install it oh
really you mean just like every other
case ok don't forget to subscribe - tech
