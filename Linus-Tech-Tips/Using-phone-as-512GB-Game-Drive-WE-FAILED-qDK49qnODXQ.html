packaging right here but anyway we
reached out to the brand integral
because they have the highest capacity
microSD card on the market then it
arrived and we looked at it we went what
are you even gonna do with this why do
you even need a 512 gig microSD card and
then the answer hit me what if you could
use it to turn your phone into an
external game drive with your whole
steam collection on it let's give it a
shot shall we Mac Weldon whose underwear
I'm wearing right now wants you to be
more comfortable so if you don't love
the first pair of underwear you can keep
it and get a full refund with their
Tryon guarantee use code tech tips and
get 20% off at the link below
so to ensure that we have a decent
experience maybe not even a great
experience but a decent one there are
three things that we're gonna want
before we get started number one is a
phone with a micro SD slot the iPhone 10
and the oneplus 6 have no expansion
whatsoever I mean that's always been
true for Apple and then the Alcatel 3v
so it's a budget phone with very little
onboard storage so it makes sense it
would be expandable the galaxy s 9 and
the blackberry key to all do have
microSD slots then step two is that we
need to make sure that the phone
supports fast enough data transfer
speeds that you're going to be able to
load up a game in a reasonable amount of
time so that already eliminates the
Alcatel 3v because that right there is a
micro B USB 2 slot it's gonna be super
slow finally because USB type-c is kind
of a Wild West or like the pirate code
type of standard where you know it's
more guidelines we're gonna have to
actually verify that the port on here
even transfers data at USB 3 speeds so
for a 1.65 gig file that's looking
pretty good it looks like we are getting
USB 3 speeds so either of these phones
is a candidate except for one little
trick if you go and you have a look at
the full spec list for them you can see
here that TCL who produces phones under
the BlackBerry brand now is only
actually certifying the card slot for up
to 256 gig micro SD cards because for
all intents and purposes 512 gig cards
don't really exist yet like integral is
not the kind of brand that typically
finds its way onto a qualified vendor
list with all that said Samsung does
apparently say yes in fact the slot will
support up to 512 kin cards now as long
as they use the same micro SD standard
the odds are it'll work
both but this card right here actually
costs about 300 British pounds to buy so
it's okay it was just it was just the
adapter so this is not an insignificant
purchase and it's not the kind of thing
that you can just to try out in the
store and then return it there aren't a
whole lot of places where you can buy it
before we go any further I just want to
plug it into a regular reader make sure
it's working and also do a quick speed
test here so they don't give detailed
specs other than saying that it's a
class 10 card micro SDXC one v10 and
then they say up to 80 megabytes per
second if you read the fine print
transfer speed right speed lower okay
that's definitely lower hmm that's a lot
I can see why they don't want to put
that in their specs but they probably
should because it would be good to know
when you have 512 gigs of storage that
it's going to take you up 18 megabytes a
second sounds a lot better than one gig
per minute but it turns out they're
actually about the same so it would take
you like nine hours to fill this thing
up from empty have a look it means means
that well that's not bad that's well in
excess of our spec unless it's using a
cached version and RAM somewhere that's
still sitting there in order to transfer
this so I think it's actually possible
that this SD card is not cooperating
perfectly with my reader here so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna throw it
into the BlackBerry key - and see what
happens alright so it pops up right away
tap here to transfer media files bippity
Boppity all good
perfect okay so everything's going
actually exactly according to plan now
all we've got to do is fire up steam and
install some games library folder hmm
okay did not see that one coming
a sign drive letter to a smartphone so
after about half an hour I may have a
solution so there's a class of
applications so there's a couple here
that I tried I tried one called WebDAV
server and I tried another one called
DAF drive and WebDAV server has the
ability to reconfigure it to a different
home directory so I have chosen the
external sd card directory then what you
do is you start the server and it gives
you an HTTP address that's using like a
local IP ok then you get yourself a
WebDAV client on the PC so this guy is
called a net drive 3 I've got a trial of
it you go ahead and you configure your
storage type which is WebDAV I then you
go mount as I guess local drive whatever
letter you want mount on boot writable
on-the-fly uploading and Explorer and
you select a path yes you connect that's
a good sign
472 gigs free ok it's supposed to be
here nope that's a good sign too let's
try to put a file in it I haven't gotten
this far oh we've got write access let's
find out what the speeds are oh wow it's
low
one-and-a-half megabytes a second I have
an idea though I haven't actually tried
this in a very long time like not since
OTG was sort of the way you do things
because we are clearly not using the USB
connection you can see here where we're
using Wi-Fi I just disconnected it but
phones do support Ethernet theoretically
Ethernet loop and loop
yes I know all right it's gonna be my
pee in there 177 okay theoretically
that's up now let's go ahead and do
another file transfer test fat is
significantly less brutal tastic and
improving and improving and okay now
we're getting pretty oh come on all
right in the meantime let's go ahead and
try to add it as a library folder
h-drive new folder steam library select
oh we might be in luck here literally
hasn't loaded yet literally less because
I agree allocating disk space I'm
guessing that's not gonna be that fast
so I finally brought in an outside
consultant who had the brilliant idea of
what was it hard linking so yeah
documents so steamy should go to steamy
in the phone it doesn't it doesn't
and then my WebDAV server ran into
apparently a fairly well-documented
issue where it was having problems with
files over a certain size so it would
allocate the space for the game but then
wouldn't actually be able to transfer
them leading me to the what was too many
of you probably fairly obvious
conclusion that this just isn't a very
good idea and/or a realistic youth case
for a large microSD card and if you
really wanted to carry around your game
library on a micro SD card you would
probably be better off just plugging it
into a micro SD reader like a normal
human being
so you'll just have to copy files to it
which will take a long time so there you
have it
it's 512 gigs
it's the size of your fingernail and
we're not a hundred percent sure what to
do with it but maybe you guys can come
up with ideas let us know in the
comments below I can't believe we were
defeated speaking of not getting
defeated I fix its protec toolkit helps
you not be defeated by your broken
electronics it comes with standard bits
like Phillips and flathead but also
torques tripoint and game bits as well
and includes not one but two aluminum
screwdriver handles a hefty quarter inch
drive for full-sized applications and a
smaller four millimeter more precision
work both drivers feature magnetic bit
sockets and knurled grips along with
silky-smooth spinning tops and all
iFixit kits are backed by their lifetime
warranty
