Sykesville cloud-enabled IP camera the
IPC 465 n it uses h.264 HD format
recording which is pretty cool because
this is a consumer level product that is
wireless and records in HD very neat is
tablet compatible as well as smartphone
compatible so you can use those to
monitor your security system ok the
first truly consumer friendly IP camera
look at view anywhere no complicated
setup HD video works day or night so it
does have a built-in infrared emitter
and then it's also an infrared camera so
that will make it so it can actually see
the infrared light bouncing off the
stuff in front of it which is good ok it
has 340 degree pan range of motion so
that's like going around like this a
hundred degrees of tilt so that's
up-and-down cloud-enabled viewing
powered by eye security plus so you can
view magnet your camera directly from
your smartphone kepada love iOS or
Android yay free apps available
web-based viewing for your PC and most
flash naval devices
neat ok 802.11 n Wi-Fi 24/7 surveillance
infrared LEDs automatically eliminate up
to 15 feet in low light conditions HD
video ok package fondants which will
obviously see as well as setup utility
requirements web setup camera eye
security Plus Google cool cool
so they show a diagram the camera
connects to the home office network
connects to the interwebs which can beam
to you wherever you happen to be so if I
you know I'm at the office and I want to
know what my cats are doing on the cat
tree I can put this in my living room I
feel like
Shh and I can see the dignity from work
I can hang out with my cats I mean how
do you go wrong I mean I guess you could
also you know monitor for intruders or
like maybe user stuff I mean that's
that's a really useful thing about
something like this you know how
security companies will charge you if
there's a false alarm set up one of
these bad boys or set up a couple set
them up at your house you don't even
have to worry about like what happens if
you know they see something and it
doesn't notify you in any way or
whatever the case may be your alarm
company calls you you go oh well let me
find out if it's a problem log in real
quick on your smart phone even find out
if there's actually someone at the house
you can be like yeah there's someone
there though please I get them make them
go away and make them not and take my
stuff so all this is pretty clear I
think we've already covered most stuff
so let's have a look at what's actually
here in the package first we've got an
instruction booklet with key product
highlights as well as brief product
description Apple application scenarios
baby monitor oh that's smart actually so
not only sound but also video that's
cool and it uses infrared 90/10 camera
oh I came up with that one on my own all
right what else we got home slash
business security got it
and three prices around 185 whoo okay I
don't think that comes with everyone's I
think that was more for my yeah use
alright start here run disk first
download the latest from ZyXEL here's
the setup guide so there's a quick start
guide when you finished you can do a
bunch of things there's all your default
settings all in one convenient card very
nice moving right along we've got some
boxes which presumably have some power
adapters and oh what's this
Wireless and USB oh ok so it just uses a
USB dongle plugged into the back of the
unit in order to get the wireless Ness
of going on I wonder if you could even
just use this on like a computer if you
wanted to wow that is the ugliest like
yellow plastic I think I've everything
okay so there's that going on we've got
power adapter we've got mounting kit
we've also got an Ethernet cable should
you desire to run it wired and a
mounting bracket very cool
ok
this must be the power break there we go
so that plugs into the thing and then
this plugs into the other thing which
plugs into the wall and finally we have
the camera is what's that custom foam
package restraints actually it's not
custom you guys want to know how this
foam packaging works you just you you
have someone actually cuts these unless
they you know are fancy and they have a
machine that does it but then they
actually cut all the various layers down
to whatever they need to be in and they
stack them all together they glue em all
together and that's how you can do
packaging without the expense of doing a
custom bulb not mold light grows on
bread like molds like you know to you
know have something be the right shape
at the end all right so remember guys
we've got three hundred and fifty
degrees of rotation this way a hundred
degrees of panning up and down look at
that I can just move it that's very cool
so that turns all the way around there
look at that it's like it's like creepy
it's like horror movies I like
you should be broken but it's not okay
sorry indicator LED on the front there's
your infrared there's your camera
remember this is 720p HD camera metal
mounting plate on the bottom actually
makes it feel a lot more solid and
that's how you're going to pair it to
the bracket which has four little
mounting pot spots right there so you go
and you can put it my fat it kind of
look around like this and be like okay
let's look at the back so we've got our
land as well as what in the world is
that okay well moving right along audio
out microphone and say oh look at that
so you can plug in an additional
external microphone that's cool there's
the power in reset and a micro sd oh
that's cool no way does it support
actually recordings okay well we'll be
back okay we've got it all figured out
this is a light sensor the IR LED are
the IR emitters are inside here and
finally this is an i/o port of some sort
and this can be used for easy local
storage so what's really cool is you
don't even have to run Network to it you
can still record your microphone in is
here however it supports both external
microphone and external audio for
two-way communication so you put one of
these by your front door and you're all
like someone comes to your door and
you're like
dad should be breaking those not um no
no you wouldn't you wouldn't say that -
then you'd say who is this and they
would say oh it's me I'm here to visit
and you'd be like go away and that's
pretty much how it would go down so what
we really need to do is a video quality
test so I'll set that up at some point
but that pretty much wraps it up for the
unboxing don't forget to subscribe -
tech tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and that's where
the wireless thing goes you don't have
to use it though remember there's local
recording as well as network-attached
recording by a physical cable that plugs
into the back of the thing and then you
can turn it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
