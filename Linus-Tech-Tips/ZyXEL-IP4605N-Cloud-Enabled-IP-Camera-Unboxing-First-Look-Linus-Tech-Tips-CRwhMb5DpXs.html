at sykes wells cloud-enabled IP camera
the IPC for 65 n it uses h 264 HD format
recording which is pretty cool because
this is a consumer level product that is
wireless and records in HD very neat is
tablet compatible as well smartphone
compatible so you can use those to
monitor your security system ok the
first truly consumer-friendly IP camera
ok view anywhere no complicated setup HD
video works day or night so it does have
a built-in infrared emitter and then
it's also an infrared camera so that
will make it so it can actually see the
infrared light bouncing off the stuff in
front of it just good ok it has 340
degrees pan range of motion so that's
like going around like this a hundred
degrees of tilt so that's up and down
cloud-enabled viewing powered by I
security plus so you can be an amateur
camera directly from your smartphone
Battle of iOS or Android yay free apps
available web-based viewing for your pc
and most flash enabled devices neat ok
8.o 2.1 1n Wi-Fi 24 7 surveillance
infrared LEDs automatically eliminate up
to 15 feet in low-light conditions HD
video ok package contents which will
obviously see as well as setup utility
requirements web set up camera I
security+ okay cool cool cool so they
show a diagram the camera connects to
the Home Office network connects to the
interwebs which can beam to you wherever
you happen to be so if I you know I'm at
the office and I want to know what my
cats are doing on the cat tree I can put
this in my living room i feel like the
e
he
Shh I can see what do today from work I
can hang out with my cat's I mean how do
you go wrong I guess you could also you
know monitor for intruders or like maybe
use your stuff I mean that that's that's
a really useful thing about something
like this you know how security
companies will charge you if there's a
false alarm set up one of these bad boys
or set up a couple set them up at your
house you don't even have to worry about
like what happens if you know they see
something and it doesn't notify you in
any way or whatever the case may be your
long company calls you you go oh well
let me find out if it's a problem log in
real quick on your smartphone even find
out if there's actually someone at the
house you can be like yeah there's
someone there go please I get them make
them go away and make them not take my
stuff so all this is pretty clear I
think we've already covered most stuff
so let's have a look at what's actually
here in the package first we've got an
instruction booklet with key product
highlights as well as oh okay brief
product description apple application
scenarios baby monitor oh that's smart
actually so not only sound but also
video that's cool and it uses infrared
nanny / pen camera oh I came up with
that one on my own alright what else we
got home / business security got it and
three prices around 185 oh okay I don't
think that comes with everyone's I think
that was more for my yeah use all right
start here run disk first download the
latest from sykesville here's the setup
guide so there's a quick start guide
when you finished you can do a bunch of
things there's all your default settings
all in one convenient card very nice
moving right along we've got some boxes
which presumably have some power
adapters and what's this wireless-n USB
all ok so it just uses a USB dongle
plugged into the back of the unit in
order to get the wireless pneus going on
I wonder if you could even just use this
on like a computer if you wanted to bow
that is the ugliest like yellow plastic
I think I've ever seen okay so there's
that going on we've got a power adapter
we've got mounting kit we've also got an
ethernet cable should you desire to run
it wired and a mounting bracket very
cool okay
this must be the power brick there we go
so that plugs into the thing and then
this plugs into the other thing which
plugs into the wall and finally we have
the camera you saw what's that custom
phone package of frames actually it's
not custom do you guys want to know how
this foam packaging works you just uh
you you have someone actually cuts these
unless they you know are fancy and they
have a machine that does it but then
they actually cut all the various layers
down to whatever they need to be in and
they stack them all together the glue em
all together and that's how you can do
packaging without the expense of doing a
custom bulb not mold like grows on bread
like moles like you know to you know
have something be the right shape at the
end all right so remember guys we've got
350 degrees of rotation this way a
hundred degrees of panning up and down
all the cathodic and just move it that's
very cool so the trains all the way
around there look at that it's like it's
like creepy it's like horror movies all
like
snick it should be broken but it's not
um okay sorry indicator LED on the front
there's your infrared there's your
camera remember this is 720p HD camera
metal mounting plate on the bottom
actually makes it feel a lot more solid
and that's how you're going to pair it
to the bracket which has for a little
mounting pots pots right there so you go
and you can put it like that and then it
can kind of look around like this and be
like wow the next should be broken but
it's not okay let's look at the back so
we've got our land as well as what in
the world is that okay well moving right
along audio out microphone and say oh
look at that so you can plug into an
additional external microphone that's
cool there's the power in reset and a
microSD oh that's cool no way does it
support actually recordings okay well
we'll be back okay we got it all figured
out this is a light sensor the IR LED
are the ir emitters are inside here and
finally this is an i/o port of some sort
and this can be used for easy local
storage so what's really cool is you
don't even have to run network to it you
can still record your microphone in is
here however it supports both external
microphone and external audio for
two-way communication so you put one of
these by your front door and you're all
like someone comes to your door in your
life
chadds there should be breaking those
done um no no you wouldn't you wouldn't
say that too then you'd say who is this
and they would say oh it's me I'm here
to visit and you'd be like go away um
and that's pretty much how it would go
down so what we really need to do is a
video quality test so i'll set that up
at some point but that pretty much wraps
it up for the unboxing don't forget
subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and that's where the wireless
thing goes you don't have to use it
though remember there's local recording
as well as network attached recording by
a physical cable that plugs into the
back of the thing and then you can turn
it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
