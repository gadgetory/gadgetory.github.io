performance at 1440p and smooth VR
experiences many of us that don't have
the coin for higher res monitor or an
HTC vive might be left wondering where
the newer gen con good old 1080p gaming
our AMD has answered that question first
by rolling out the new Radeon rx 470
under the banner of its hashtag better
read marketing campaign and no AMD isn't
calling for the communist uprising
against the NVIDIA bourgeoisie but
rather focusing more heavily on the bang
for the buck rather than every ounce of
possible performance with its current
Polaris architecture so does the rx 470
have the potential to be the weapon of
choice for the 1080p proletariat let's
find out
gee fuel is the sugar free alternative
energy beverage to maintain focus and
endurance over long days and gaming
sessions save using the code Linus at
the link below
so the rx 470 is quite similar to it's
much ballyhooed Big Brother the rx 480
both use of Polaris 10 series GPU thoa
the 470 has 32 compute units and 2048
stream processors a bit less than the 36
and 23:04 of the 480 both use
conventional gddr5 memory with the 470
having a rather standard complement of 4
gigabytes with a bandwidth of 211
gigabytes per second at only 120 watts
of typical board power the card should
also be well-suited for lower end power
supplies with headroom to spare at 280
watts of power draw from the wall it
still has a little bit of catching up to
do in terms of matching and videos
current power efficiency but at 280
watts you can get by with a very cheap
but well-built power supply just fine
this specific version of the RX 470 we
have on the bench today is a Nitro+
aftermarket cooled card from sapphire it
features a dual BIOS switch in the top
left hand corner of the card which
allows you to switch between quiet mode
with a low tuned fan profile or boost
mode with a max clock speed of 1260
instead of the quiet modes 1206 the
button right next to that switch is for
LED modes which can do basic mode
changes on the fly to your lighting
system on your card or you can just use
the upcoming tricks 3.0 software to do
more specific alterations to the RGB
LEDs you can even remove the dual 95
millimeter dual bearing fans by just
removing one screw each allowing you to
clean or replace them with ease the
Sapphire version comes with two HDMI 2.0
and to display point 1.4 ports while the
reference Edition adds the third DP
connector at the expense of one HDMI and
speaking of which if you're more
interested in the reference version it
looks virtually identical to the 480 but
unlike the 480 which was billed as a VR
for the masses card the 470 is being
marketed as a really
HD gaming for all there actually hasn't
been a card released yet under 200 US
dollars at launch that can max out new
titles at 1080p so can the RX 470 be the
first let's dive right into our
benchmark results to find out starting
off with rise of the Tomb Raider at very
high presets the 470 got 64 fps and dx11
and 67 in DX 12 at 1080p
we saw similarly strong results in
hitman with our settings maxed out with
the card even breaking the 70 FPS mark
in DX 11 moving on to the classically
punishing title Crysis 3 we can find
that yes the 480 can run Crysis 3 at
60fps with very high settings in HD
66 frames to be exact but there's a more
interesting question to be answered as
well with this card how well does it
take advantage of Vulcan the new open
source API that AMD is backing fairly
heavily well there are only three games
currently out that we're aware of with
Vulcan support the most recent of which
is doom although it's not exactly the
hardest game to run Vulcan definitely
gave us a performance increase with the
RX 470 pushing 107 frames per second
with Vulcan as opposed to 86 with opengl
4.5 doom doesn't support Direct X in
case you are wondering notably it beat
out the more expensive gtx 1060 which
managed 101 FPS in vulcan and speaking
of expense cost is the only area where
we felt the RX 470 fell a little short
don't get me wrong at $180 for the
reference edition it's a very good bang
for your buck card and definitely not
what I'd have called expensive however
are only $20 cheaper than the more
powerful our X 480 the pricing is more
than a little confusing this card really
should have been a bit cheaper to be a
more enticing option however at $70 less
than nvidias current mid-range offering
the GTX 1060 the RX 470 may even
undercut a possible upcoming gtx 1050
only time will tell but at least for now
if you want to slay just about anything
at 1080p without paying
ton of extra for compute cores that you
simply don't need there isn't much
reason to go with something else even if
you're not chomping at the bit to tag
all of your tweets with hashtag better
read mass drop has brought back their
drop for the antlion mod mic 4.0 which
has been a community favorite for a long
time now
speaking of which linus has a review of
the mod mic which was posted two freakin
years ago at this point but if you do
want to see his review of that product
you can check it out up here the main
idea behind the mod mic is a way to turn
your awesome audiophile headphones into
a gaming ready headset without
sacrificing the awesome audio quality
that your headphones have it attaches
via a magnet system so it's easily
removed when you don't need it and the
magnets actually attach to the headphone
with 3m adhesive pads so if you ever
want to remove it you won't have any
sticky residue on your beloved
headphones you can learn more about the
at LAN mod mic 4.0 and any other drops
