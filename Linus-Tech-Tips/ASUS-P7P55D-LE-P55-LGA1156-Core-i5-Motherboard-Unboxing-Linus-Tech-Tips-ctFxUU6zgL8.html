today that we're going to be checking
out it's the s sous P 7 P 55 @dl e now
le can mean any number of things in this
case I'm pretty sure it means late
addition you've got a lot of the basic
features that you're going to want so
you've got your 8 phase power you've got
support for what is it there mem ok
Turbo v overclocking software mem ok is
actually one of the more unique features
we'll talk about that in a bit
so inside we've got our i/o shield
that's like that padding on the back
that's kind of neat you've got these
little ports that you can use to plug
your individual pins into then plug the
whole thing into the board the easy
connector or something like that we've
got an IDE cable to SATA cables and a
manual with the DVD inside so you can
see it's actually a very very basic
accessory package with this board so
let's take out the divider here and get
that out of the way and let's take out
the actual board itself so this is one
of the lower end boards in a Seuss's p55
lineup so let's go ahead and put that
down there you can see it's actually a
little bit on the narrow side so
normally you'd see that a board will
have one two three screw holes and it
would actually be a little bit wider so
this is a narrow board it helps them
save on cost and it helps them keep a
cleaner layout gives you a little bit
more space to work in
so let's do the general layout we've got
our 24 pin connector over on the right
edge exactly where we want it
support for dual channel ddr3 memory
like all p55 boards here's our LGA 1156
socket and here's our eight phase power
design up at the top of the board you
can see you've got an 8 pin power
connector for the CPU right there and
then let's have a look so you've got a
couple of PCI Express ports but we don't
have support for crossfire or SLI on
this particular board this is kind of a
neat looking hietzing here it's a very
unique I actually kind of like the look
of this board to be honest we've got 6
SATA connectors so if I can just get the
cameraman to have a look so 2 right
angle ones and then four of the more
classic style that comes right out of
the board and let's have a look at our
rear panel I don't really like the color
this PCB I prefer to see it like a jet
black but it's not too bad looking
okay we got two ps2 ports we've got
eight USB ports so one tooth and then
we've got digital audio eSATA and 7.1
audio so actually a pretty good a pretty
good isle port thing here oh yeah let's
talk about nem okay yeah before you zoom
out so that's the mem okay button
basically mem okay you press this button
and the board will default to super
loose super non-aggressive timings for
the RAM so you can make sure that you
can boot with any Ram no matter what the
profile is on the memory itself so thank
you for checking out my blog on the p7
p55 ble</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
