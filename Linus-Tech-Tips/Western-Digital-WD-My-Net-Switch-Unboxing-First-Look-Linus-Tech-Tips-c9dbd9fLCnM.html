the WD - which this one's gonna go
pretty fast because other than just the
general news that WD does networking
stuff now it's pretty much a switch so
let's get this up let's say the WD has
to say for themselves eight gigabit
ports okay
port based quality of service that's
cool energy-efficient okay so it
probably turns off ports that you're not
using and whatnot and turns down the
transmission power for shorter cable
runs these kinds of energy efficiency
features full HD okay any gigabit switch
it's capable HD Auto power-down for any
sports cable like the detection for
transmit power conservation called that
one more flexibility well now to design
an auto sensing ports on a duplex
detection port based quality service
okay so connect to your router power up
expand your network yes
switches are good for all those things
and let's open it up and have a look at
the my net switch great packaging what's
that black internals my net switch plug
the thing into the thing and then plug
the other thing into the other 10 3
steps very simple if you can't hook up a
switch then you probably don't have any
business running networking so don't
worry about it these are not smart
switches these are just plain old
switches I mean don't feel bad if you
couldn't hook up the switch my mom can't
do it she just calls me and then I deal
with it for her so you know if you have
like a nephew or a son or a you know
creepy uncle or something who knows how
to do networking then you can get them
to do it for you if you if you don't
know any good let's go ahead and have a
close look at the - which I'm just gonna
put down on the table and the diesel
kind of do is camera thing as he sort of
looks at it you get some you know as
much yeah he's giving me the shrug here
as much as you can do glamour shots of a
network switch see look at that look at
that shiny and then like not shiny so
there's a matte finish here and a glossy
finish here yeah if we have like a lazy
susan we could like put it on it and be
like not my arms are twisting see I'm
stuck I tried okay so on the back you've
got your eight gigabit ports look at
that oh this is
actually cool okay five five big do a
unique feature so what they meant by
port-based quality of service is you
actually plug in physically so it's like
completely dummy proof your higher
priority devices into the ports labeled
high your mid priority devices into the
ports labeled creatively mid and your
low your low priority devices into the
port's labeled cow low low its low
nightcap they weren't going for the
confuse I know I knew it said no I'm
just kidding
on the front you got your indicator LEDs
power in and it's a switch about cooling
