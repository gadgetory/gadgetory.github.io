down in San Francisco for the last
couple of days at their 2016 Developers
Conference to get our fingers on the
pulse of what's hot in the industry
right now and the answer pretty much no
matter where you look is VR there are
still a lot of challenges to overcome
way to the devices dizziness image
quality both in terms of frame rate and
resolution cost the requirement to have
a phone connected though Samsung did hit
they are working on standalone devices
but there is a lot of cool stuff coming
down the pipe that is going to help
continue VRS march towards mainstream
acceptance first up is the gear 360 this
is not the first time they've shown it
the actual unveiling was at Mobile World
Congress about a month ago but this was
our first chance to spend some real
quality hands-on time with it the device
itself is pretty simple on each side
you'll find a 180 degree wide angle F
2.0 aperture lens with combined 30
megapixels of sensor resolution behind
them though it appears that that
resolution is utilized only for Stills
and when it comes to video you'll be
limited to almost 4k or 3840 by 1920 the
unit we checked out isn't quite finished
so the side door was taped on but that
didn't stop us from popping it off to
have a look at the micro SD slot and
swappable 1350 milliamp hour battery
that's good for two or so hours of
recording the camera is dust and splash
resistant there will be an IP 68 rated
case available later and we're expecting
at the time of filming this it to cost
somewhere in the neighborhood of 400
u.s. dollars given its 350 euro price
across the pond that's cool Linus but
how does it work really well actually
this is an impressive little piece of
kit you pick your mode stills video
time-lapse or short looping video is a
separate mode from video for some reason
then with the camera paired to the phone
via Wi-Fi direct you won't have enough
bandwidth to save a file directly to the
phone this way but what you'll get is a
really nice live preview of what you're
shooting once you press record then what
you do is you browse the files on the
camera convert and copy them over to
your phone and you
can play it back a number of different
ways you can view the raw unstitched
file you can look around using the
motion sensor on your phone or you can
pop it in a gear VR and have the full
immersive experience considering that
it's priced similarly to a high-end
GoPro I can see a lot of creators having
a ton of fun with a device like this
speaking of fun it's time to go hit the
VR demos first up is gaming this Vulcan
demo was really impressive they got this
alien assault game that's reminiscent of
a VR game that I played at an arcade
about 12 years ago so weapon aiming is
handled by looking rather than actually
pointing the weapon the graphics are
fairly rudimentary and given it's a tech
demo it's impressive its playable at all
but the gameplay is pretty easy with a
blaster that takes out like ten dudes at
once in a secondary fire with no
recharge that drops an asteroid on the
entire assaulting force which doesn't
sound impressive until you consider that
this is running on a device that is
literally a thousandth the size of the
gigantic gaming booth that I was
standing in all those years ago and this
is in no small part thanks to Vulcan the
low-level API that is now supported on
the galaxy s7 is capable of volumetric
effects real-time shadows light
refraction anti-aliasing translucency
and in a nutshell a similar or better
graphical experience than what you could
expect from an xbox 360 a last gen
gaming console I mean sure you won't be
running this real-time star mass
accumulation demo in a VR environment
yet but seeing the performance
improvement from OpenGL es2 Vulcan gives
me more hope for the rate at which this
is going to improve in the future
downstairs we found a couple of more
impressive demos what stood out about
this one was the fact that aside from
using cameras to track the location of
the person they tricked out these nerf
guns with lights and actually I think
they're Bluetooth wireless triggers so
you could play another sort of drone
assault game firing the gun
independently of where your head is
pointed because it's wireless the
latency did make it a little bit
disorienting but then when accessories
like this come out for lower latency
solutions like the HTC vive
Oh Villar man very cool which isn't to
say that every game like VR experience
has to be all about the lowest possible
latency I think the most impressive demo
we saw was from Globo core they had this
sort of escape room with eight $3500
opti track cameras feeding into a six
core desktop running a gtx 980 and then
from there the positional data was
streamed over Wi-Fi to a galaxy s7 in a
gear vr that is actually running the
game itself the graphical fidelity of
which was the best we saw running off of
a phone here at the show the position of
rigid bodies their rotations and
positions in the scene are being tracked
by the cameras and to differentiate the
objects in the scene white IR reflective
markers are attached and unique patterns
so they can be manipulated and
reconfigured to solve the puzzle there
Indiana jones-style puzzle uses a total
of ten tracked objects including a
lantern that provides more or less light
to you in real time there are some
limitations here if you put the objects
too close together things can get a bit
janky and and the same goes if you
obstruct the camera's view of the IR
reflective markers but overall the
immersion was the best out of the demos
we saw and they even told us they had
problems with people trying to run out
of the room that they were trapped in
once the door lifted and had to
physically restrain people to keep them
from barging into a physical wall oops
