unboxing and NCIX exclusive this is a
yate loon fan okay Caitlin so they're an
oem these are direct from china so
you've got a couple things on the box
here first of all this is a sleeve
bearing fan this particular model so
this is the d 12 SL 12 the so that's a
low speed fan it's a 120-millimeter so
it is large 120 x 120 x 25 k that's
enough about the packaging let's get
this thing out of here okay so as I said
these are an NCIX exclusive and the
thing that makes them exclusive is not
that there yet Lin fan all kinds of
products and companies use a yate loon
fans for all kinds of things I think
Corsair uses them for their power
supplies they OEM for a lot of other fan
manufacturers but we have one that has a
black frame and red blades and it also
spins at the low speed so there's the
fan itself the thing about sleeve
bearing fans is you want to avoid using
them horizontally like this or like this
you want to use them in a vertical
orientation if you're going to be doing
it like this you want to be using a ball
bearing fan we also had them sleeved so
you can see it's got quite a long three
pin sleeved connector on it so it's not
going anywhere it's excellent and then
we've also got it included is an adapter
that goes from three pin 24 pin if you
want to plug it into a molex connector
on your power supply the last thing
that's included with this retail box fan
is for fan screws that you can use to
mount it to your case so just wanted to
give you guys the quick heads up on the
gate loon fin and thank you for checking
out my unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
