DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts welcome to part
2 of my coverage of solises play series
of network speakers in part one which
you can view here
I covered wired setup ease of use the
basics of their app and the sound
quality of the play one and the play
three this time we're going to start
with the wireless experience now last
time because apparently I'm an idiot I
hooked up every single speaker
separately via ethernet thinking that
you needed their bridge in order to run
wirelessly or you were stuck with Wired
I realize now that you actually only
need to plug any one component in via
ethernet and it will act as the
controller while the rest will simply
join a mesh style wireless network
automatically so you only need to run
power to them so the bridge is meant to
be a controller for folks who can't get
an Ethernet cable to any of their ideal
speaker locations to get the mesh going
or for folks who want to extend its
reach without installing random
intermediate speakers between two more
distance ones live and learn right haha
anyway well generally I'm not a big fan
of wireless networking
slow interference ridden
headache-inducing terribleness music
streaming isn't terribly demanding and
samosas solution which runs on the same
2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz
frequencies as Wi-Fi but uses a
proprietary communication protocol
actually works just fine it is slower
adding new speakers to the mesh
adjusting settings changing volume these
are all a little bit less responsive but
it's still very tolerable and reasonably
configurable so like if you're having
interference issues you can manually
select a channel if you want but I
didn't experience any stutters hiccups
or dropouts in my house with it on auto
and I think part of the reason for that
is they have a huge buffer on the music
that you're playing if you're streaming
off a device you can test this by
playing something off your phone turning
off your Wi-Fi and seeing how long the
speaker keeps playing for so there you
go this little white box with its two
ports which is something that I can
handy but very very optional because in
most cases the wireless speaker
experience is just as good without it so
let's move on to the other stuff that
they sent us oh yeah the play bar
speaker bar is designed to let you use
Sonos gears and replacement for your
TV's built-in speakers or a more
traditional aftermarket setup but just
like the room speakers the key here is
going to be ease of setup and once again
I was impressed the software made things
basically effortless I mean compared to
my Onkyo receiver and calf speakers
let's get this out of the way right now
soon as the solution doesn't sound as
good and actually cost about the same as
I paid for that but the simplicity is
very compelling and it's not just simple
to set up but also to use the play bar
can be added to your mesh to play music
in that room like any other sono speaker
then unlike my multi remote setup that
my wife constantly complains about it
can be configured to automatically
override wireless speaker functionality
when it receives an optical signal from
your TV
Media PC game console or whatever else
so you don't have to think about it the
set-up guide walks you through all these
steps including how to use your TV as a
pass-through for audio from all the
connected devices without using its own
poopy speakers and it also gives you
some helpful tips on positioning the
sound bar and this is the point at which
I notice that their logo is the same
right side up and upside down that blew
my frickin mind anyway once it was set
up I was pretty happy with it volume
control is handled seamlessly through
your existing remote and it sounds way
better than your TV stock speakers ever
will and the base it delivers is
surprisingly tight and loud on top of
that the play bar has a magic give me
back some of the mid-range vocal boost
button when it's running on optical that
I wish all of their speakers had all the
time because it really makes so Knossos
sound signature much more appealing to
me so there's my feature request in this
video so far so good with the play bar
though but it gets cooler than that in
the same way that you can link speakers
in multiple rooms together to
synchronize playback and create stereo
pairs of matching speakers within one
room you can add a sub to your play bar
and use software to control its
behaviors almost recommend standing the
sub upright or
laying it down under a couch and I'm
beginning to sound like a broken record
here but the setup is as easy as
pressing a couple of buttons and yeah it
was easy what that said I didn't really
feel like the sub contributed much to
the experience for me if you really want
to crank things then you'll appreciate
it but and this isn't a criticism of the
sub but rather an endorsement of the
play bar at normal TV and movie
listening volumes for me I found that
the play bar delivered Apple based on
its own the sub isn't the only thing you
might want to expand though you can add
a couple of play ones too with some
solid configuration options so you can
have them just join in full blast or act
as ambient music enhancers when you're
playing music in that room or you can
use them as surround speakers for movies
it works as well as any of their stuff
one viewer did specifically asked me to
see if the play bar would work with a
DTS 5.1 stream in XBMC and it handled it
just fine and surround so no complaints
overall but even if it works exactly as
advertised while you can expand the play
bar this way I didn't find this config
that compelling I'm not the right
customer in the first place I don't have
enough room behind my couch to play
speakers there at all but that's not
even my main problem even if I had space
I don't have a power outlet there so
once again I'm a bit disappointed by the
limitation that Sonos has imposed on
their gear by not giving the play ones
standard speaker inputs and maybe
putting a beefier amp with a couple of
speaker wire outputs on the play bar or
something this would make the unit
slightly less sleep perhaps but speaker
wire is a lot easier to hide next to a
bass board than power extension cords
I mean maybe to make things easier a
play one enhanced skew in the future
could have like a power pass-through so
you could daisy chain them with only one
of them plugged into the wall or
something but as it is I doubt I'm the
only one who will find a Sonos surround
setup impractical however easy it might
be to configure from a software side and
I guess that's it for Wireless and the
home theater setup stuff so I'm going to
conclude part two with some more general
thoughts on having my house so nosed up
it's not cheap but for me this really is
next-gen it works the way they say it
does you can stream tuned
dual speakers full rooms combinations of
rooms you can adjust volume as groups or
to each individual speaker within a
group expansion is easy and it all feels
so made to go together even something
like that failed mid-range I might not
prefer that sound but I have to
acknowledge that from the top other
speaker line up to the bottom there
delivering that sound signature
consistently so at least when I order
something from Sonos I know what to
expect and a big benefit here is that as
I walk from room to room it's not
jarring to hear something the same music
but playing very differently as I move
around my house I think really at this
point the only thing missing for me is
to add more options to the lineup I'd
love to see some better sounding
speakers some more purpose-built ones
like maybe a weather-resistant outdoor
speaker for example but that's all I
really have to say other than that I
wholeheartedly recommend so Knossos
ecosystem it's not perfect
like anything easy it's not the best
sounding it's not the cheapest but it
just works and I even got wife approval
on it and at the end of the day that's
the bottom line for new tech gadgets
isn't it alright guys thanks for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment let me know your thoughts on
