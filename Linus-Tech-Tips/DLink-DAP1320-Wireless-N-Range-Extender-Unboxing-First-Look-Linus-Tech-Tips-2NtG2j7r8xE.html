the d-link
da P 13 20 this is an N 300 wireless
range extender operates it up to 300
megabit per second gives you extended
range it is ready to use and features
advanced security so what do you need a
wireless range extender for well I would
postulate that the reason you might be
looking for a wireless range extender is
that you wish to feed your llamas only
the best grains grain fed llamas
actually produce the best milk which
according to my conversation with slick
earlier where I actually am not allowed
to just make things up and state them as
fact may or may not be true I actually
don't know that it isn't true but I
don't know that it is true but I want
what I know isn't true is that you would
be shopping for range extenders for
anything that has anything to do with
unless your llamas needed wireless
internet yeah or if you needed internet
while you're feeding the llamas then you
might need one of these so right right
right right right okay so how do you use
it easy push-button setup so it uses WPS
you press the WPS button on the router
then you press and hold the WPS button
on the wireless range extender until the
LED and the credit decatur starts
flashing then you release it then you're
successfully connected seriously okay
well apparently it's that easy so
there's a WPS button on your router
there's a WPS button on this guy right
here it plugs right into a wall outlet
so you just press and hold that until
the button I mean the button won't do
anything because it's not plugged into
the wall but it'll do something if you
plug it into the wall let's see if this
takes up the outlet next to it I'm very
curious about this because that would be
high does not excellent love to see that
thoughtful design good work d-link tip
for positioning these wireless range
extenders so the most important thing
guys is make sure you don't place it
right at the very edge of your wireless
range because even if it does work the
speed will be abysmal remember every
time you add a wireless range extender
you are effectively cutting the amount
of bandwidth you have in half because it
actually
that n 300 it has it's got to use half
of it to communicate with you and the
other half to communicate back to the
router so you're not going to have as
much available speed when you use these
but it does give you better wireless
coverage and I realized we forgot to
look at the included documentation
documentation is good check it out they
include one of these little cards it
tells you everything you need to know
about your little wireless range
extender they give you a written offer
for something sort seriously get out
here a quick install guide which is
basically covered already on the outside
of the box but apparently they feel the
need to give you a much more complicated
Quick Start Guide which booting probably
include instructions for not using WPS
I'll look at that they include two
little stickers you put a little sticker
on little guy please put that there then
you can do stuff that's smart thank you
