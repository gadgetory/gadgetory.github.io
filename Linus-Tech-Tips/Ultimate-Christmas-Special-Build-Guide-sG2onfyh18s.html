computer hardware he's wanted a rig
because he's used to like some ancient
laptop so he's been trying to buy
computer hardware for Black Friday and
Lou can I keep refusing to help him with
anything
yeah we're just like no no don't don't
buy that don't buy that uh yeah no it's
not a good deal it's not a good deal so
uh secretly down here working on putting
together a rig for him so let's go
through it we got we went through the
tickle trunk so to speak so we got an i7
4770k you gotta kick it by a 7/8 UD 5h
this is a pretty freakin high-end board
ok we dug up a 2 terabyte WD green
storage drive rachels SSDs go ok about a
Coppola we got 16 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance memory and then we grabbed a
couple of our test drives so we're gonna
do 2 and 128 gig drives in raid 0 2 SSDs
and raid zero for the boot drive he's
been eyeing the Corsair err 540 since we
got our hands on that but he recently
changed his desk so he can't use it
anymore so instead we're gonna use the
one we use for our ultimate video
editing build guide so that's the TJ o4e
w from silverstone and then power supply
I don't think we're quite decided yet
we're either gonna chuck this OC zzt in
there it's actually not a bad power
supply it's modular and 80 plus bronze
or we're gonna go like all out silent
and put the Rosewell 500 watt 80 +
platinum power supply in it we're gonna
probably pull apart the case because I
don't remember what ventilation around
the power supply areas like and find out
if that makes sense because I'd like to
make the system quite quiet if we can so
for our cooler we've got a dark rock to
from be quiet and then for graphics card
okay well we'll pay our graphics card
soon stay tuned guys so he's taking over
the motherboard man open so you can at
least I said no it's actually pretty
piece mother what see this they wanted
to go with a goal idea like a soos did
their gold motherboards this is how you
do a gold idea you don't make the whole
damn thing hold this
you just do it like a little bit and
it's okay it's fine that's good my
camera scope don't look good but it
looks good alright well you might as
well do a CPU installation guide you
wanna be the narrator sure so he he
spins it so that the notches are
properly lined up and elegantly pulls up
the arm and then very delicately places
it in the slot oh my god oh wow
impressive thank you finish him if you
could do that accurately that would be
kind of amazing so now we're revisiting
the cooler the cut line is this this is
the very cooler that in a different
build guy cut his finger open so this is
round two what he applies the thermal
compound
precision PRC skill determination yes Oh
actually that's not that great no no I
probably should have gone for a longer
thinner line
I'm sorry oh I don't know you could do
like a macro of like the header because
you won't be able to see it so the way
the heatsink actually screws in is
instead of screen and from the front you
screw it in from the back so you just
have brackets that are pre-installed on
the front and then you just tighten
these screws at the back in it
preferably a cross pattern going little
by little until it is completely
attached to the board so once that's
done we should have a pretty good look I
mean it's important for a capture PC to
be extremely quiet because you don't
want I mean obviously it's gonna be used
in an environment where video production
is going on so you don't want to be loud
and obnoxious right all our graphics
cards are upstairs so uh then he was up
here editing we couldn't really dig
through them so here we go but he got oh
yeah go with the 680 so Brandon uses
CUDA and then like a playback engine for
some of the stuff he does so we figure
it that's a pretty good choice so Luke's
working on front panel headers yeah good
work like we assign all the right jobs
because the guy with the like Gigantor
hands is plugging in front panel
connectors and I'm like plugging in this
fan so here's how to install a graphics
card you put the thing in the slot see
right there and then you put good screws
in the other thing so here's our 680
it's starting to come together hey yeah
that's uh nice looking Rick that guy is
still here editing our rampage for
extreme black edition things so we've
had to just kind of do this but there we
go oh actually do you want to grab the
back side panel just so that it's the
sexiness comes through properly so there
you have it guys
not a bad a little rig for someone who
wants to do some video editing and get
into gaming a little bit oh yeah oh yeah
and of course you know - sure
video capture okay just like that yeah
so cable management on the back is
reasonably clean but not clean enough
that we necessarily want to show it to
you there's only one more thing we need
to do here is just tuck these away and
then we are pretty much ready to rock I
mean I'm liking how few cables we had to
use to put this rig together we only had
to use one modular cable that was in it
has four SATA harnesses on it we were
able to plug in all of our drives and we
were ready to go so the only thing left
now is the surprise okay so it's not the
best wrapping job ever but my wife's
helping me kind of put like
like wrapping sort of looking thing on
it so that it will look somewhat nice
and then we're gonna surprise him
tomorrow morning so all right so Brandon
went out for lunch
so we're bringing out the system we got
the muscle handling that that aspect of
things let's bring it upstairs all right
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna like
barricade this door or something so that
week so that we hear them coming or they
call all pile boxes at the top of the
stairs cuz I don't use he'll be like
where are all the boxes blade piled up
the stairs pick it up okay
oh okay glass record a video
Oh Brandon we're good we're good we're
not filming I mean we are filming but
surprise oh it's your Christmas bonus
what seriously
we were trolling you so hardcore when we
were building a system with all your
favorite stuff and I'm telling you it
wasn't for you what we built this on
Friday what that's all we could learn to
convince you not to buy yeah we're like
to do please don't buy things you didn't
buy anything to do well thank you for
your hard work thank you and yeah it's
pretty much the ball Ernest this was
that B blog video that you asked me
about that was on the release schedule
oh really all right well congratulations
and joy Merry Christmas and all that
good stuff I wish you hadn't had a
little more patience because I wanted to
give it to you at Christmas but you're
like oh no I'm gonna buy sister like
I don't think I could tell you for a
month all right that's pretty much it so
