of mind
the match
in light
I can do PC build guides forever I
really could with the millions of
combinations of computer parts I could
make millions of these videos and none
of them would be the same as each other
today not the same is not good enough
and instead will be doing something
really different from anything I've ever
done before today's build guide is not
about the expectation that you're going
to watch it by these parts and put one
together at home just like it but rather
about the sheer spectacle of a gaming PC
made for one purpose wicked
CPU overclocking welcome to the ultimate
sub-zero PC build guide normally once we
start out to build at our safe
uncluttered static-free workstation the
only thing we really need to build a PC
is a multi-bit screwdriver but today is
a little bit different you'll need some
scissors I would recommend getting an
eye fix-it kit so you got some pokers
and pratas as well as a variety of more
esoteric bits and I could pair side
cutters a pair of pliers those kinds of
things will also come in handy in the
last one is you should probably grab a
magnetic parts tray to keep all the
little screws from getting lost now as
always before you begin assembling the
computer I recommend plugging the
components in together and powering the
system up once outside of the case to
ensure everything is working using the
motherboard box as a handy dandy test
bench for our CPU the choice was obvious
the core i7 4790k has a wicked 4
gigahertz clock speed out of the box
without even factoring in turbo boost
doesn't kick off a lot of heat which is
great for keeping temps cool and is
basically the top tier CPU of choice for
gamers everywhere who don't have any use
for extra cores that can be had on the
premium LGA 2011 3 platform now normally
I actually copy-paste the CPU
installation instructions you know not
today forget about lift the retention
arm put down the retention arm no really
forget about the retention arm we're
going to remove it use a size 20 torques
and remove these three screws from the
front place the CPU into the socket to
keep the pins safe while you're working
and then it's time to break
the needed or art eraser that we'll be
using to insulate the CPU socket area
it's very important that there is as
little air as possible around here
because where there's air there's
moisture and where there's moisture
there's condensation as soon as it
starts to get chilly and as soon as
there's condensation there's water on
motherboards which well I'm sure you see
where this is going
build up a thin layer of art eraser
around the outside of the socket put the
retention mechanism back on then install
the CPU again flip the board over and
cover the backplate with art eraser then
run the CPU mount bolt through there
steel backplate one of the included
neoprene insulating back plates then
through the motherboard
on each bolt use a plastic washer then a
steel one followed by a nut and tighten
them up nice now it's time to build up
the artery sir on the front until we're
almost even with the top of the CPU heat
spreader go slow focusing on eliminating
pockets for air to get trapped in you
can use a small poking tool to fill gaps
once that's done apply a layer of arma
flex neoprene adhesive insulation and
you're pretty much good to go
now there are a lot of different schools
of thought when it comes to socket
insulation and this technique is not
actually the best one but should be fine
for the temperatures we are aiming for
if I was doing something more extreme
like a two stage or even three stage
phase cooler or dry ice or liquid
nitrogen I would add some shop towels
between the eraser and neoprene direct
some airflow at the socket and even
consider filling the socket pins with
dielectric grease something that's gone
out of fashion lately due to RMA
concerns it's almost impossible to clean
out but that undoubtedly improves safety
at extremely cold temperatures memory
was an easy choice for this build the
theme is white like frost or something
like that so I reached out to our
friends at HyperX who hooked us up with
a massive 32 gig kit of their fury white
ddr3 1866 RAM for our system with that
selection finished all that's required
is to pull back the tabs on the memory
slots align each module according to the
notch in the bottom of the socket and
press firmly on both sides until the
latch closes fill the further sets of
color-coordinated slots before the
closer to if you're using only two
sticks of RAM now my original plan for
this system was to just find some white
K slap a system in it and call it a day
then I found this the PC v10 phase
change from LD cooling I mean what's
more white than a white case a white
case that makes it snow on your CPU this
bad boy features quad 120 millimeter
radiator support on the top a single 120
support in the back motherboard support
for XL 80 X 80 X 80 X pretty much any
ATX you could want
and is made of pure white powder coated
aluminum with the exception of the steel
base to support the integrated single
stage phase change cooler in the front
down there is the condenser which cools
the gas that then gets sent through the
insulated line up to the evaporator head
where the rapid evaporation of the
liquid inside an endothermic process
cools the CPU and the resulting vapor is
recycled back to the large black danfoss
compressor that compresses it and then
pumps it to the condenser where it all
starts again this is the same principle
that's used in your refrigerator at home
with the key difference being the
strength and rated duty cycle of the
compressor please don't try to cool your
computer with a fridge you're not the
first person to think of that it's not
designed to handle a constant heat load
and it will die there's some other
secret sauce in here as well
Eldee cooling has included their own USB
controller board that uses a type K
thermal probe in the evap head to
display temps on the built-in display in
the front delay system startup until the
phase system is up and running and to
automatically shut down your cooler once
the system is powered down they've got
some more stuff planned
- like fan control for example if not a
lot of work into developing this puppy
alright so start by removing the two top
side panels and the left side bottom one
with a hex head screwdriver and stash
them somewhere safe use for screws or
anti-vibration mounts to install a rear
120 millimeter cooling fan and install
your nine motherboard standoffs here
here here here here here here here and
here our motherboard choice was another
no-brainer asus is saber-tooth z97 mark
S sub Ronco board looks sick features
all the latest and greatest tough series
tech so lots of controllable fan headers
and temp sensors slot covers are
reinforcing backplate a five-year
warranty and of course I Suz his
legendary build quality and BIOS layout
press firmly on all four corners of the
i/o shield at the back of the case until
they snap into place hold the board in
place
laying phryges on their sides isn't
recommended so I'm not tipping this guy
over as a precaution while you screw in
the middle stand off then do the other
eight in these low
occations while we have easy access to
the board plug these two included cables
into the power switch and the check
12-volt spots on the USB controller then
run the other end to your power switch
header and a fan header on your
motherboard like so you'll also need to
plug in the reset switch and your LEDs
at this time this case has no front USB
audio or anything else like that though
so that's it
so I was going to choose a power supply
that comes in white by default and then
I was like ah we have the Corsair ax I
version of those like awesome
individually sleeved cable mod cables so
I gave Corsair a call and got their
excellent 80 plus platinum ax 860 I
power supply put in the mail for me it
arrived I took that sucker apart
immediately painted her white and put
her back together now with all of that
said for most users I would strongly
recommend just buying away power supply
since the internals of computer power
supplies can be extremely dangerous and
even kill you but man you cannot deny
how nice the results look put the power
supply in on the little pedestal in the
basement fan side up and install four
screws like this into the back of it
plug the eight pin connector into the
top of the motherboard and run it down
the backside of the motherboard tray to
the power supply then do the same for
the 24 pin connector you can also plug
in a two connector SATA cable at this
time and two PCIe cables for the
graphics card our drive selection for
this system is to Intel 730 series SSDs
running in raid zero SSD raid continues
to be the weapon of choice for
enthusiasts to want more than a single
SSD can offer but aren't willing to pay
the premium for PCI Express or n dot two
based solutions and 730 s are excellent
for raid operation thanks to their
exceptional performance consistency now
this case is native tuna 1/2 inch drive
support is mostly done by screwing in
through the front of the motherboard a
solution that isn't that elegant but
fortunately it also includes a dual
drive three-and-a-half inch adapter so
we're going to use two of these screws
per side per drive
to secure them to the adapter then use
these rubber grommets to slide our
adapter into the bottom most three and a
half inch Bay at the front now we can
run SATA data cables as well as SATA
power cables and that's pretty much it
now I realize this is becoming a bit of
a pattern here but the video card was
yet another SuperDuper obvious choice I
mean hmm
what video card is white enough to go
with our white themed build I guess
maybe the GTX 980 Hall of Fame from
Galax the only real question was liquid
coolant or leave the stock air cooler on
it and that question was answered for me
when the only company that makes a block
for it didn't have it ready in time for
filming and didn't reply to my emails so
there you go this case includes no PCI
slot covers a little bit can be
purchased separately if you don't have
any lying around so this process is as
simple as lining up the card over the
top PCIe 16x slot firmly pushing it into
place and installing two of the included
fine threaded screws finally plug in
your two PCIe eight pin power connectors
from before now normally I do the CPU
cooler much earlier in the building
process but in this case well I kind of
wanted to save the best for last
just for fun I fired her up before
actually putting her on the CPU to see
the frost form on the evapo near the
boiling liquid inside and down man this
stuff geeks me out so you're going to
want to cut a length of the included
insulation tubing and position it as a
boot under the universal hold down plate
like so apply thermal paste to the CPU
preferably Arctic cooling Sarah meek put
a plastic washer followed by a metal one
followed by a spring followed by another
washer and the included thumb screws and
tighten down the cooler use your common
sense as far as tightness is concerned
it needs to make good contact and you
know compress the insulation that's
around the CPU socket but you also
shouldn't be trying to break your
motherboard and a half finger tight only
no tools normally at this point in the
video I try to do some cable management
and finishing touches and try to do a
recommendation for a monitor and
peripherals that kind of go with the
theme of the build but frankly there's
nothing left to do
cable management wise other than plug in
this fan that I completely forgot to do
earlier and then as far as peripherals
go
well white monitors are pretty hard to
come by these days so there's not a
whole lot to say there and as far as
white peripherals go mild few ITA's
money Doritos as I do while you're
gaming I wouldn't really recommend white
peripherals so why don't you do yourself
a favor by some RGB stuff and set the
LEDs to white or something if you're
into color matching the line is tech
tips com form would be a good place to
go if you want specific recommendations
in your price range at this point you
can power on the system by pressing the
you guessed it power button on the front
and if the cooling system is already
cold you'll need to wait a few minutes
for it to warm up and once that's done
the PC itself will then power on and
you'll need to press delete to get into
the UEFI BIOS load optimized defaults
then switch to advanced mode in the BIOS
by pressing f7 and make sure that the
fan header your phase controller is
connected to is not set up to run with
any sort of a fan control curve at this
time we've actually got a full
overclocking guide for this particular
CPU which you can watch here but the key
difference in this case is that we have
the ability to push more voltage through
the CPU without causing instability due
to thermal limits and the inherently
better overclock ability of processors
that are running at cooler temperatures
and I guess that's pretty much it that's
all folks I hope you enjoyed our phase
change cooled white out build guide
because I sure did I was able to dial in
a 5 gigahertz stable overclock at one
point four volts with low temps in the
single digits and low teens in a matter
of seconds and I hope this glam footed
you guys are checking out of the system
turns your nerd crank as much as it does
mine because as much as a system like
this is beyond impractical I mean we're
talking a few percent better performance
in games and benchmarks in exchange for
a lot of noise and extra heat being
dumped into the room that the computer
occupies boy was it fun for me to play
with something extreme like this for the
first time in almost 10 years the last
time I went sub-zero was with a chilled
liquid setup that I built from a torn
down window air conditioning unit so
this is quite a lot more elegant
you've come a long way since then I hope
this was fun for you guys to watch
thanks again for watching liked it if
you liked it dislike it if you thought
it sucked leave a comment at the link in
the video description on the Linus tech
tips forum if you want to discuss this
particular builder you have any
questions about it that's a great place
to ask also linked in the video
description a place where you can buy a
cool t-shirt like this one give us a
monthly contribution or change your
Amazon bookmarks one with our affiliate
code so we get a small kickback whenever
you buy stuff on Amazon that kind of
thing helps us out a lot thanks one more
time to you guys for watching - well
yeah you guys for watching oh yeah and
the folks who worked really hard making
this video happen editing it shooting it
and all that good stuff see you again
