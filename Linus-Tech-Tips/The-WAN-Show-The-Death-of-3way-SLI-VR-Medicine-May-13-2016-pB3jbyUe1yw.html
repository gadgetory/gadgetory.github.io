hello oh we're now we're now we're
encoding frames there we go welcome to
the hot show pool show yeah really
welted ice and condensation show the web
show live streaming to you here from
beautiful ice and condensation show yeah
well that condensation can we enjoy
every ways on April Fool's we should
just change what the show is about and
be super hardcore about whatever it is
yeah I could be like that chicken show
like all the latest news about chickens
chickens chicken farming chicken
breeding is chicken breeding chicken
farming whoa cuz you like you like so
chickens and then you harvest chickens
what spectively well that's animal
husbandry yeah yeah that's right
welcome to the animal husbandry and
farming show we've got a lot of great
topics for you guys today including
Nvidia's GTX 1000 I didn't know if
you're ready for that one you took that
from me or also some bad news about the
GTX 1080 with respect to SLI
if you're super hardcore into having
like lots of graphics cards yes or not
that bad news but we'll talk about that
later
yeah Oxford study finds that virtual
reality can help treat severe paranoia
which is wheat and the Hyperloop one
shows us how fast we could get from here
to there kinda more at 11 also known as
now
oh I'm so
just sit in here everything about me is
damn
all right so in videos 1000 series oh I
was just gonna say it has been a
freaking week yeah he went to the
unveiling of the GTX 1080 and 1070 why
did they call it the 1080 yeah do they
enjoy creating confusion like the whole
time I was like okay no one's confused
yet but I've only talked to like
reviewers and like tech heads and then I
talked to Taryn and he was like wait
does that mean it's a 1080 card or a
fork a card can it play 4k games and I'm
like oh damn it and people are gonna
walk into a story okay and you're gonna
have a big box sales rep and they're
gonna say I want to buy a 1080 they're
gonna be like LG Samsung Asus and the
customers can be like uh Samsung is a
good brand I'll have a 1080 Samsung yep
and yeah it's gonna be bad because
that's not gonna be what they meant to
buy and it's gonna be a big problem so
for those of you doubting that we are
actually in a jungle that sound effect
could not possibly have been
pre-recorded and added into the stream
after the fact and we've got a doubter
that we're even live right now yeah
we've got hold on hold on let me let me
scroll back up for a second
yester 61 come on you are you are the
real gesture we are like oh my goodness
we are no one no one we get on this all
the time oh you guys aren't live all
right well we're gonna tell you lie like
every show about the GTX 1080 so let me
just that original poster here is Oh
apparently no one so I'm gonna pull up
the original article here from a non
tech get this on the screen
Luke was there though he doesn't need an
article from a non tech walk us through
what you ex Barry adds so one thing that
I want to address like immediately
because I think this is really important
is because it sounds awesome the
performance sounds great people aren't
benchmarking
you'll maybe hear about that later
super ambiguous no real details thing
but ya know like usual benchmarks yes
but they did claim two times the
performance of a Titan X and three times
the efficiency of a Titan X power
efficiency uh that I did have a little
caveat there that was VR specifically
and we'll get more into it later there's
like a software thing that they're doing
that's allowing them to get more
performance in VR which is still
interesting to me
super as someone who definitely has a
vive in the mail yeah not in the mail
yet yeah soon to be in the mail and
talking to some of the Nvidia guys after
the event J's two cents and I were like
yo you didn't talk about DX eleven or
twelve at all because honestly in their
press event I didn't see enough people
complaining about this they didn't
mention those performance metrics once
so we asked them what was going on there
and they said it should be 25 20 15
percent faster than two nine 80s or 92 I
or attend X which makes sense because I
mean if you look at the specs it's like
yeah it's got a lot more clock speed
yeah it's on a new process note 16
nanometer but they are pulling the same
thing that they've now done for three
generations including this one where
they released their second from the top
tier chip which traditionally would have
been like if you go all the way back to
the 400 series that traditionally would
have been a 460 okay like the equivalent
die size chip until they're releasing
that as a high-end and then they're
gonna follow it up presumably with I can
never keep dropping 100 yeah with a GP
100 G P 104 yes
so the the 1080 in the 1070 our GP 104
and the presumably Titan whatever type Y
yellow Titan Mexico Mexico edition I
don't know cuz it's hot so whatever that
is and the 1080 Ti and or whatever else
possibly will be the GP one
by the way I finally figured it out cuz
I was like they always have these
letters in the code names okay
it's GeForce Kepler number oh my god
he forced maxwell numbers that's why the
that's why the me that's why the p 100
isn't GP 100 because it's just pascal
100 it is not the gamer skew oh my god
that makes so much sense finally clued
me into it so that's your do you read
that
no I was just thinking about I was like
okay so it's called GP 104 now I get to
remember another stupid I don't I don't
know so that's gf Fermi GT yeah I know
but I got you yeah but finally it all
lines up I am an idiot anyway that's
probably telling us we're dumb I know
here comes it's always with the time
always with the time delay ah alright
what else you got from the event there
okay so there was four major features so
you guys almost the specs it was 8
gigabytes gddr5 X and that was on V 1080
and then it was 8 gigabytes still but GD
r 5 which is probably completely fine Oh
1070 1070 is just 8 gigabytes of gddr5
but that's probably completely fine
we'll get benchmarks of that at some
point sorry I had some paperwork
oh but at one quote that they have is
that the GTX 1080 and presumably 1070 is
built to make the most of today's
multi-monitor setups curved screens and
head mounted displays and that's like a
thing the reason why they brought that
up with simultaneous multi-project
which is something that they've been
working on where they can and they've
had stuff like this in the past but this
is much more so they're making it so
that they can render more than one like
viewing angle at once so basically if
you have a multi monitor setup
yeah this is super cool you're gonna
like this a lot if you have a
multi-monitor setup and I explained this
in the software video a little bit but
I'm gonna go into it more here your
multi-monitor setup usually with your
displays curved on the side because
you'd have them angled in towards you
you mean more like angled on this angled
on the size display is there a
difference and curved displays also have
this problem yes that's true yeah yes
lately different like I mean maybe not
most of the ones that are out there now
but like remember that prototype that
Alienware showed off that's super curved
one that would definitely suffer from
from distortion of the rendering and
sometimes even just having a crazy wide
screen like playing in 21 by 9 at all
yeah we'll have these problems it's not
as big of a deal I didn't really cover
this much in the individual video
because it's kind of a use case scenario
depending on what game you play and
stuff if they support that resolution a
lot of times they don't so it stretches
it and to stretch it you have these
warping problems yeah where the scale is
screwed up on a lot of the objects on
the side like the cockpit oh yeah the
bars for the for the window of the
cockpit are like this their master side
yeah yeah you play rocket League and
everything on the sides is warped out
and this happens when you have multiple
displays as well and it's even worse
because you angle them in and then
things like break as they go across the
screen because the angle that you have
them on doesn't look right and stuff
right
simultaneous multi-project should
theoretically fix all of these things I
don't know how and I'm sure we'll figure
it out eventually
yeah but the they can figure out that
the angle of your screens and I can
solve that problem and line everything
up for you so if you're aiming at
something even across angled screens it
will be flat that is incredible and and
they fix the there's no there's no more
skew there's no more warping going on
they fix all that kind of stuff the
scales fixed I should have put an
asterisk on that that's incredible
wow that's incredible tell me more if it
works if does it require game dev
support do we even know this yet
can we talk about this yet no if we know
that yet okay what else we got then
let's talk about the one you're stoked
on Ansel yeah okay so
angels' really cool I don't know if we
have the games that are supported for it
right now
this one does need dev support I don't
see a game list here I did mention the
entire game list in my video one of them
is like the division I'll try and pull
it up just talk about the feature for
now what angela is is essentially a
incredibly badass screenshot software
which when he told me about it I was
like okay yeah I had to asterisk that
with like trust me it's interesting in
the video as well because like no it's
actually really cool it can screenshot
things I don't remember the exact
resolution but it's up to up to 32 times
your monitors resolution and then
there's another resolution number which
is like whatever when you hit first but
it's like 65,000 by 32,000 or something
ridiculous now so they showed it off
with this ginormous canvas about 15 by 3
meters created using Ansel that has a
two gigapixel capture from The Witcher 3
now to be clear none of this is going to
make your game that you're playing run
at that kind of a resolution no that is
not how it works but in much the same
way that dynamic super resolution which
they launched with the 980 can take more
samples like it can kind of go okay what
if we were rendering the game at four
times the resolution then you're
basically running a render of the scene
yes and then instead of just having it
go from your view it's rendering
everything so the camera will actually
what you do in order to perform an Ansel
screenshot isn't just press print screen
they wanted to say this a million times
during the show yeah like no more print
screen button although hopefully you can
find it or something because that would
be cool but it like pauses the game you
get a free cam so say you have like say
I'm like punching you and my heads down
here you could change the camera so that
instead of like being out here and it's
a fighting game the camera is now
looking up at me an angle that you would
never be able to get traditionally it
would then move
once you tell it to take the screenshot
who then move the camera around and make
sure that it gets everything from
everyday different angle and one
situation that they showed with The
Witcher is they took a screenshot like
really far out of what I believe was a
castle for going off of memory yeah and
then they were like okay but because of
the insane resolution you can zoom all
the way in through this window and then
look at a book and see the printing on
the book which is really cool and this
allows you to do things like there's
really not that many notes but there's
something called EXR which for camera
people means that it has like amazingly
good color information it's basically
like taking a a raw photo right so you
could essentially like change the
lighting in the scenes right make it
basically b-day even if the photo was
taken like at night and you can do a lot
of really cool things in terms of
cropping you can even take 360 degree
photos so if you want to like one thing
that I thought of would have been really
cool you have to enable the game
developer has to enable it so this
wouldn't be paused so I've got that list
Witcher 3 was used to show it off other
games that have announced ants will
support include the division the witness
lawbreakers Paragon no man's sky Unreal
Tournament and abduction so there you go
there's the at the event someone asked
if it would work with shadow play so you
could go back into a shadow play
recording and then run Ansel and I said
that they would not comment on it yet
that doesn't seem like it sure doesn't
seem possible that really doesn't seem
like it should work has to know cuz I
thought the way shadow plays working is
it's basically just an h.264 yeah coding
of I was surprised that the guy seemed
enthusiastic when he said that they
can't comment on it yeah so I'm not
really sure how that works I would have
thought the answer would have been no
y-yes
like so but let me knows maybe they're
changing shadow play
maybe Nvidia hasn't been entirely
transparent about how shadow play works
yeah so I don't know that's that seems
pretty freakin to be very cool if you
could go like wow that was cool let me
go back and like make sure I have a
really cool render of that because
something I would have really liked is
uh I'm gonna talk about classic Wow
again when Myst rallies went down there
was all those like people gathering yes
and all that kind of stuff they
release something called mr. Elias
memories I believe it's called yeah
where you can go back in and like be
there again it would be super cool if
Angela existed so you could get like
crazy angles like way above where
everyone was right you have really
interesting views it's not built into
the game so it will not work but that's
the first thing I thought of was if this
was enabled way back right and it
definitely didn't exist it would have
been super cool to have those kind of
screen shots something that you could
relive and you could take a 360-degree
photo this is gonna make people so
hungry for like 16 K monitors and like
eight to ten times more powerful GPUs
because honestly going back and playing
games that you haven't played since you
were running you know like you know even
going back and playing something like
far cry 1 which you might have run the
first time on like a you know 6600 GT or
something like that it is amazing how
much more is left in those games when
you run them on more powerful hardware
and you really cranked up all the
details especially these engines that
scale well this is not increasing the
resolution of the game no not what
you're actually running yes
just taking a high-resolution screen
shot so it's what it would look like if
you could do that yeah so like one
really cool thing too is you can take
these photos and then there's an app for
your phone now Nvidia VR viewer I
believe it's called and you can send the
ansel screenshot to that app and then
view it in like a Google cardboard or
something they gave everyone at the
event Google card playful so that we
would be able to do that obviously
haven't been able to yet because don't
have it but that will be very cool 170
so there's some more VR features path
traced audio which is you know for
regular two-dimensional gaming also
applicable but for VR is particularly
important so and like needs to be
pinpoint accurate so that's very cool
that they're working on that one thing
that I mean I don't have a lot to say
about this there's a path traced audio
it should massively increase the
precision of you being able to figure
out where things are based on sound
which is super cool yeah you should be
able to tell if
things in another room yeah or if it's
behind some things or if it goes from
being behind something to being not
behind something yes exactly something
that like all of the 3d audio solutions
that exist today quite frankly just are
not good enough at from my experience up
there I've heard this is completely
hearsay but I've heard that one of the
main guys that they have working on this
used to work with like the US military
on like sound stuff in terms of like
taking the reverberation of sounds in
order to find snipers and tanks and
stuff within cities from like super far
away so like I'm glad he's working on
something important now yeah yeah well
I'm assuming he figured that stuff out
but like so he's probably pretty good I
don't know
so that should be cool and one thing
that I'm super excited for is I know it
sounds really lame visually but it would
actually be a lot of fun to do is if
they release like if Disney releases
like a small tech demo where you get to
do the training droid fight hmm so if it
like if you go to put your helmet on and
then becomes black and then you just
hear where the training droid is and it
takes shots and you have to try to block
that would be crazy
that would be so much fun it sounds so
stupid visually because you literally
put a headset on in order to see
blackness yeah but like it would be
really fun that would be really fun
yeah I don't know so of really fun this
was originally posted by a ln1 1/8 the
original article here is from OSI
overclocked 3d dotnet let's go ahead and
pull this baby up so remember a member
of the EVGA tech support team has
confirmed that the 1080 will be limited
and assuming assuming the rest of the
lineup will be limited to two-way SLI
and they said that we can confirm that
1080 cards only support up to 2-way SLI
and anything above this will not work no
matter the SLI bridge just to explain
that last point there's a new sli bridge
can you use an old one theoretically no
I've heard I don't know I no one really
knows I even contacted them seeing if we
could get another card to test SLI
because it's supposed to be new and
improved and stuff yeah and they're like
no no one's getting that yet
they will be eventually but they're like
well we want to keep fair ground so you
guys can't be the only one with that
slight test yeah now and I was told in
that that I would need the new s
leverage so yeah I think you have to use
the new s elaborate okay it hasn't been
like outright confirmed interesting but
yes Li bridge has been with us for like
10 years I think yes and 6000 series of
the holy crap and something that I did
notice was if you look you might be able
to pull this up right now maybe not if
you look at my coverage of the wind
we're having the talk with all of us in
the room I have some b-roll of a system
that was built by BS mods they're
awesome check them out and it has two
cards in it in SLI not three not four
only two and it has the new sli bridge
on it
yeah and it's big and that matters
because I was checking out my sample
card because when I first read this I
was like what's mine had two fingers on
it and it does I double-checked it has
two sli fingers on it but the SLI bridge
was big so I think what they're really
doing is just teeming the SLI lanes yeah
cuz they even said it's double them
really so they're just teaming me
slightly it's like I'm pretty sure it's
not confirmed but like that that the
bridge is big meaning it's probably
taking up both of them and there are two
fingers on my car I don't have it here
but like I guarantee do you think
they're gonna let us just put on two old
bridges or do you think they did
something stupid like like cross the
paths internally on the bridge so people
can't do that I'm assuming there is some
type of internal logic that teams them
together okay which but then is that I
don't know why it separately Pressley I
mean I don't know if motherboard many
fish is gonna include that especially a
different spacing really that's the
thing I love progress as much as anyone
but when you have such a staple as the
SLI bridge like who like I have like
multiple pins and SLI bridges I have
your favorite one I have like about yeah
like I got my old EFI LAN party one with
the black PCB like huh and
one thing that was interesting was I
expected before I went to the event that
in our like duty bag which had the April
Fool's energy drinking like yeah lift
bar and stuff which is actually kind of
funny they were gonna be giving us an S
lie bridge right the reason why I
thought that was because on the like
press signup page right it was a
question asking us what our favorite
motherboard spacing for two-way SLI was
and then no and then no yeah so I'm
wondering if they were pulling everyone
that went to the event to figure out
which spacings they should have more
available I hope this is from Nvidia
calm yeah that would suck I'm not okay
personally I'm not super worried that
we're now limited to - yeah it's 3 &amp;amp; 4
is pretty dumb we've talked about it
time and time again 3 &amp;amp; 4 is not good
even if the FPS number is higher like
people who send me their system config
and they're like yeah I'm getting 3 cuz
I'm a super BA do you you end up like no
actually you just get stuttering and
it's yeah and compatibility issues and
lint and it's just bad go out go back
and watch the compensator that had for
four cards yeah 4 9 82 for Tet tight for
tight Nexus I think I think so yeah
we're trying Nexus and like it was
unplayable in anything yeah cuz so much
stuttering and like just yeah it was
gross to play any things on anything on
that machine and I'm hoping that if
they're limited to two now they will
just analogous on to completely explain
the the limitation to two as well if
it's just too old bridge's yeah because
you couldn't yeah okay okay okay I think
you cracked the code I think so speaking
of cracking the code if you were
thinking yourself gee I sure wish I
could launch a new career as a code
cracker I actually don't know that
lynda.com has code cracking of course
but you could learn programming yes
maybe lead you into that kind of feel I
wasn't even gonna try and bring it into
something they actually teach we did it
though but we did it we did it so
they've got web development photography
visual doesn't you excel business where
you can store your crack

subscription speaking of unlimited we
don't monetize your unlimited time
in the day what are we talking about
fresh books yeah fresh books yeah
because you don't have unlimited time to
monetize your whatever he was talking
about let's just do them both fresh
books lets you stay organized
save time and make more money by
focusing your effort on your own
compressor whether it's plumbing whether
it's you know making arts and crafty
type thing and selling them whether it's
uh you know I don't know house painting
whether it's small IT service whether
it's on dogs you know whether it's dog
grooming fresh books is a cloud tool
that lets you track your expenses keep
track of your invoices for your clients
email invoices to your clients get paid
directly through fresh books and
basically make your life easier if
you're not the kind of person who
finishes a long day of teaching dance
lessons in your garage and sits it wants
to sit down from the computer and do
some accounting yeah that's which is not
a thing that most small business owners
are really that into because let's face
it if you were a small business owner
who was into accounting you would start
up a business as an accountant wouldn't
you that actually that actually makes a
ton of sense makes it Tennessee you know
what after a long day of doing
accounting you probably don't want to do
your own accounting isn't that such a
thing no let us seem like that drives
the Beanery quite legitimate yeah you
know it's really it's really funny
though like the ok mechanic driving the
beaters is less less less offensive but
like or are less not notley's more
offensive rather but like would you let
a dentist work on your teeth
that had really bad teeth oh but they
can't even work on their own teeth
anyway they could have they could be a
great dentist but how my attention there
was that Russian surgeon that operated
on himself in Antarctica like removed
his appendix or something that's the
exception ok maybe that guy's crazy
speaking of exceptions and not the rule
I'm just gonna fire this up most of our
content is available to everyone on
YouTube some of it like nerd sports is
only available on vessel and
so for hockey is out now I can't tell
you guys how to you know sort of manage
your manage your subscriptions to
services but what I can say is vessel
offers a one-week free trial that gives
you early access up to a week to a ton
of content creators not just all of our
channels and if you were to start your
one-week trial now you would be able to
check out I'm just gonna screen share
with you guys here I'm going to try not
to have it would allow you to check out
all four of the episodes that are
already up on vessel it would allow you
to have a subscription still when the
fifth and final of our first portion of
the series comes out teaser footage
that's the team we played against which
was and this is sort of more along the
lines of what you can expect from us
it's really low the connection here at
the hotel in mehico is not exactly that
great and we are streaming so brash uh
it's actually kind of a miracle that
that loaded it all so you can check it
out the links gonna be in the video
description over on YouTube but it's
vessel calm it's not exactly complicated
alright so let's move on to some of my
personal chat to some of our additional
topics here but I guess for the YouTube
viewers it'll be down below here we go
this is freaking cool so the original
here is from Giz meg I'm just gonna fire
this up here and start up my battery
bank again I think I'm triggering either
overheating or overcurrent protection
trying to keep my laptop juiced up here
so this is a very early test it's called
a propulsion open air test or poet it
does use electromagnets to propel a sled
at 115 M miles per gallon apparently and
considering Colton wrote it but it's
actually 115 miles per hour or 185
kilometers per hour which is pretty damn
pressive along a test track running
1,500 feet long so this isn't actually
to test like how fast it can go this is
more of like a stepping stone theory
kind of deal so we're gonna add on to it
and add on to it and add on to a noun
and add on to it and grow and prove the
theory as they grow this is just kind of
an early-stage thing so I know people
would be like I thought they were
claiming it would go much faster than
that's like 700 miles per hour and
you're right they were voices that and
that I don't know that was often I don't
know
and hopefully they will grow up to that
point but this is yeah this is their
little thing it's open air it's supposed
to be in a vacuum tube like one of the
main points of this whole thing is that
it's in a vacuum tube they don't have
that part going quite yet so yeah that's
it's fine they're just testing like this
the Sand Shark sled and all that kind of
stuff okay yeah so it's about ten miles
north of Las Vegas Nevada
claiming a bunch of stuff that we've
already heard about apparently the
experiment when the capsule is created
will be using a compressor to create a
stronger vacuum ahead of the vehicle to
cut out an air resistance all this kind
of stuff we already knew even the test
system will include a passenger and
cargo compartment and batteries to power
the system and contain a levitation
device to lift the capsule off the
guardrails which will probably be air
bursts or something along those lines or
airburst sorbet
magnets but I believe last time I heard
it was air burst so that should be
pretty cool we have a picture here which
I will try to bring up although I'm
using Linus's laptop I'm not sure how
things are set up so
I already did that
okay so no race there you go so there's
the sled which is obviously not gonna
carry huge amounts of cargo or people or
literally anything kind of looks like a
little cute spider thing but yeah like I
said they're gonna grow on that and move
from there so this is cool but it might
not have been what you expected but it
is still very cool their video for it is
like massively over produced which is
kind of fun but yeah all right Amazon
direct video service so this was
originally posted by sand al on the
forum the original article here is from
the verge challenges YouTube by offering
uploaders a cut of the ads which I don't
think is right at all that is a very
sensationalist and honestly a little bit
misleading headline because speaking as
a youtuber I'm just gonna throw this out
there I'm pretty sure that checks show
up monthly from YouTube where they give
us a cut of and I think it's to do with
the ads on the videos maybe the ads I
mean if it's not to do with the ads on
the videos becomes Larry Kaiser I'm just
gonna disable them from now on because
apparently it's just coming from magic
um
so let's let's go through Colton's notes
on this thing so you can be mystified
this is that will let video creators
share content and receive a cut of the
revenue okay
offering creators a variety of ways to
earn money including royalties through
streaming to Prime members that's cool
because right now YouTube does not have
a subscription service that gives
youtubers a cut of the royalties or the
monthly oh wait hold on a second huh
YouTube Roush is a huge red tube oh no
no don't go there
unless you want to but um and you're
overage um uh-huh sorry but with that
said with that said I mean if we had
Amazon Prime subscribers in our audience
and we were to do some kind of YouTube
read series or something which we don't
have which we don't have in the works at
all by the way I'm seriously we don't
we've done nothing going on with YouTube
red they wouldn't be able to access it
unless they had YouTube red as well
that's right so if we were to say okay
yeah it'll be on Prime and it'll be on
YouTube red all of a sudden we're giving
people choices and if they already have
Prime anyway because they chopped at
Amazon all the time then then that's
that's cool so the revenue sharing will
be through rentals purchases
subscriptions and ad impressions so it
sounds like it could be free to use you
probably won't need a Prime membership
and Amazon definitely has the video
serving horses to make something like
always happen so that's pretty cool
I don't I have I don't know at all but
just reading this and looking at what
Amazon's doing I'm getting the vibe that
they're not targeting people like us
right I think they're targeting more of
a Vimeo crowd than a YouTube crowd hmm
because looking at like the pictures
that they're using as their samples and
stuff yeah it's not like super fun we
did weird thing I don't know what stuff
is super popular on YouTube the kids
stuff react react things like it at all
I don't know it doesn't seem like any of
that at all it seems like little like
user-created shows like if rocketjump
made longer episodes some more like like
podcasts or like more like like so maybe
this episodic content the sonic content
we're like shows or like very very like
higher production value oh that's not
good it's that battery dying as well
think so uh-oh that could be bad we
might be an audio-only cast for a little
bit here while I summon while I summon
Brandon to bring us another battery
anyways I'm gonna keep talking it seems
like yeah higher production quality not
really like reviews are like short kind
of contained videos that it seems like
they're still leaving that market up to
YouTube
hello it's okay it's all good so yeah I
did I think they're still leaving that
kind of stuff up the YouTube I think
it's going to be yeah more high
production quality like like short
movies is basically what I kind of think
they're going for anyways moving on
Oxford study finds that virtual reality
can help treat severe paranoia
if you just like to share okay yeah that
kind of works
okay okay okay we're back nice we're
back with that connection um
no never mind never mind Brenda says you
can't I'm just telling him we're
switching to the webcam we're
improvising we're improvising in Mexico
all right so I'm gonna put the mic on
top of the computer it's when Showtime
again kids it's also like right in front
of your face all right not a worse time
I put it there okay so um what else we
got first topic serious yeah anyways
sorry Oxford study finds virtual reality
can help treat so awful ow I don't know
where to look closely by insanely secret
D on the forum by the way it's only
secret D that's a fantastic name the
secret anyways VR can help treat severe
paranoia by allowing people to face
situations that they fear now severe
paranoia is like oh yes I'm working on
uh is like one to two percent of the
population so that's actually pretty
significant if you go into total number
of people and it is like the mental
health issue it's fear paranoia is like
not cool anyways how they do it is they
have people face their fears in VR so
one they already did a trial one group
was encouraged to use normal defensive
behaviors and another group was told to
hold a long stare or stand toe-to-toe
with the avatars that encompass their
fears I guess and super cool over 50% of
the patients no longer had severe
paranoia at the end of their testing day
one day
day one day it says singular day I don't
know if like I haven't read super deeply
into the article I don't know if it was
a whole that sense of edible but it does
if it works at all if it does anything
at all even if you need like regular
regular therapy let's say for example
like VR therapy yeah I would I am so
excited about stuff like that
I mean using technology for gaming is
great
I am super down for using it for gaming
why am I looking at that camera still oh
yeah I'm super down for using it for
gaming but using it for using it for
making people's actual RL lives better
that is the real deal speaking of real
deal this was originally posted by Oh No
okay one thing I want to drop in over
50% of the patients no longer had severe
paranoia at the end of the day that were
I believe lowering their defenses and
standing toe-to-toe and the ones that
use their defenses 20% of that groups no
longer had severe paranoia and at the
end of the day you'll have to conquer
your fear yeah you still have to like
but you can go again in the eye knowing
that is not read that it's not real and
you're in VR and you know that
personally and it's that must make it so
much easier considering 50% of them were
able to overcome their severe paranoia
in a day it must have been easier for
them to do so so let's launch into some
rapid-fire topics here um so as agent
six has been announced it looks freaking
awesome
oh I was gonna do the micron one but
where is that even so as agent six it's
probably down a little bit there's like
no details on it at all they're they're
making it so that when you build your
city it expenses a little bit wow I'm
still looking at the wrong camera it
expanses so you don't just have like a
singular location and you have districts
so you have like your industrial script
in like your your-your-your food growth
district and your culture district all I
kind of stuff then people can attack
districts individually when they come to
fight you and it makes it so that like I
believe if I remember correctly there's
more inter trade between cities so if
you have one city that's in the
mountains it can be like totally
industry focus then you have one that's
like a long and nice River it could be
like
totally growth and food focused and I
can interchange with each other the
problem that might introduce is say
someone comes and wipes out your growth
city then your industry city is stuck
with no food right so they're trying to
make it so that each game is more so
rush the Great Wall and what's the
Colossus I think it's still a good
strategy probably four or five
iterations of the game but yeah they're
trying to make us that each game is more
unique so basically why your city is
placed will more greatly influence how
that city will naturally that is a
struggle for sale yeah it is so they're
working on that they're also working on
I think they call it advanced
multiplayer we're getting so much crap
for our crappy camera called you know
what we are streaming to you from Mexico
so sorry I'm surprised you've been
working yeah the miracle it's working at
all anyway I think it's called advanced
multiplayer we have no notes on this
it's supposed to make scenarios that are
easier to be completed within a single
play session with friends ah which is
also a huge thing that they need to come
over yeah because the long play like
have everyone come over for a whole day
I'm do it it's still cool risk is fun
but being able to have a smaller
contained experience it's also very
there's people who have time to play
save and then there's people with jobs
and families quite frankly I haven't
I'll to do a full play sieve game with
friends in a very long time
yeah and that's like one of my favorite
things so yeah Nvidia launches GT X 1080
with micron gddr5 X and micron has
officially ramped up full-scale
production of gddr5 X which shouldn't
come as any surprise given that there
are cards launching that have it this is
interesting this is supposed to oh that
was posted by almond Tech next one here
is posted by captain Gaz and this is
fascinating PayPal to pull payment
protection for crowdfunding sites on
June 25th they're basically saying look
if you haven't seen all the news
articles if you haven't been burned
already it happens
the episode of South Park Joe if you
haven't seen Luke's Neptune pine video
um we're sorry but we don't feel bad for
you anymore
when you give them that your money
understand that you are giving them your
money can we talk about how amazing this
title image is for a moment what it's
just like someone took like a not great
picture of like the side of someone's
phone that had a paypal ago on it yeah
just like that's good enough honestly
what it kind of is but like what how did
you even think of that like it's just
sort of table I I want you know what you
know what you know what I bet it is
because no one would be taking like no
one would be doing like phone device
photography with another phone camera
and you're like look how crap look how
crap this looks you know what I bet it
is I bet it is actually like a crop of a
video that they made another thing a
photo they took for a phone for a review
yeah that happened to have a PayPal logo
and the why they would even like why
that would be why they wouldn't just put
a PayPal logo at the top of the of the
page I don't know PayPal has like logos
for people be used to that kind of stuff
like here you go
Kickstarter notes about 9% of their
projects never deliver and that does not
account for ones that deliver garbage
sorry dad you'll get your hammer
eventually yeah um and there and if the
campaign just goes Buster doesn't
deliver you can no longer dispute the
charge so in a statement made to
Engadget from PayPal they said in
Australia Brazil Canada Japan United
States and certain other countries we
have excluded payments made to
crowdfunding campaigns from our buyer
protection program it's fine I don't
think PayPal can be expected to do that
be completely honest what do you think
no I think it's completely reasonable
especially given that you're not exactly
getting you know blindsided by this
anymore yeah um all right I've got
actually okay there's a couple more big
ones out the city of Zug xub oh lordy
it's Swiss so who knows this was posted
by data lab on the forum city of Zug is
the first government to accept
Bitcoin dun dun da this legitimizes
Bitcoin and well I don't know Swiss
Swiss it's Swiss Swiss Swiss Swiss bank
yeah what you doing oh you want me to
translate the page yes I guess I should
have done that city will world add to
Bitcoin pioneer boy nothing that you
officially did not help let the record
show that you were not help definitely
knew it so that was great
eventually all right let's get my notes
up here so the Swiss town is billing it
billing itself as a hub for the digital
currency industry will accept Bitcoin
for some payment starting this summer so
the Town Council Inzaghi approves up
every time I say it wrong I'm gonna be
the smooth buried alive here I was
already approved plans to accept
payments of up to 200 Swiss francs for
the municipal registration fee starting
July 1st part of an experiment and many
enzyme tout the town's reputation as
part of crypto valley um approximately
15 companies linked to the digital
currency business in crypto valley very
very cool this article doesn't show an
umlaut over it so like I would expect
that and then it to be zhuge but because
of that now I'm like
I don't know I don't know what to tell
you all right this was posted by Z mule
and this is freaking awesome Microsoft
has announced the original article
here's from ARS technica Microsoft has
announced removal removal of some of the
particularly stupid restrictions that
they've placed on Universal windows apps
particularly games that people were
complaining about things like that you
couldn't run native fullscreen you had
to run so borderless windowed mode
things like this and this is the one
that we're specifically talking about
here that was guy room artists here
requiring vsync why I don't want that
vsync leg please do not make me have it
it's super annoying because it's bad and
terrible so gamers will have better
control over performance and picture
quality trade-offs the latest update is
that you'll now be able to decide
whether or not to have vsync enabled and
you will be able to use g-sync and
freesync as well it's super good because
that would be so frustrating holding
like I don't own one yet I hope to
eventually hate to get one but owning a
g-sync screen or a free sync screen and
just not being able to use it because
it's better yeah it really really truly
is objectively better
speaking of objectively better the LAN
show normally so we're sorry about this
yeah that we got going on here but I
think that's pretty much it for the show
we will see you guys again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel totally
different bat location
oh no after-party today yeah no no
after-party well there'll be an
after-party but you guys aren't invited
