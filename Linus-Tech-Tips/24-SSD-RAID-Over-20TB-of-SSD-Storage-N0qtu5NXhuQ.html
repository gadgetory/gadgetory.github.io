media you've probably spent a fair bit
of your time lately feeling bad for me
about all of the SSDs that I had to
mount in our new 24 drive solid-state
storage server no all right well then
you've probably at least been hoping
that I'll make a video about it at some
point and talk about the performance and
that time is now this is the all-new
Wanek the fastest beast machine in our
office
of course rhx 1,200 eye power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet performance and corsair link
digital advanced monitoring and control
click now to learn more so our current
storage server ruskin uses Seagate 3
terabyte consumer drives in a raid 6
array to achieve respectable read and
write performance and some fault
tolerance the array can actually lose up
to two drives before suffering
catastrophic data loss assuming it's
able to rebuild before more drives fail
or an unrecoverable error occurs this is
all fine and good but the main problem
with it is that Ruskin was built for one
editor to work on 4k video files at max
speed and we now have a whole room full
of editors so while the Ruskin 10
gigabit network interface and sequential
data speeds aren't really bottlenecks
its mechanical drives are much more
suitable for a single person workflow so
I reached out to our good buddies at
Kingston with a crazy idea what if we
slipped free of the surly bonds of
mechanical storage and danced the skies
on SSD silvered wings to which they kind
of went how much silver Linus I told
them I wanted 20 for one terabyte class
drives and doggone it for some reason
they said yes I think the most
incredible thing about that story is how
much the landscape has changed in such a
short amount of time two years ago I
could have been the Pope in Rome and any
SSD maker would have laughed at me for
wanting 20 terabytes of redundant SSD
storage in a single server but in 2015
Kingston's just like yeah we've got the
enterprise-grade KC 310 it's got an 8
channel thighs and s10 controller 960
gigabytes of capacity ECC flash
protection for data integrity power loss
protection trim support although we'll
be relying on idle garbage collection
and raid anyway and it's under 60 cents
per gig I mean holy balls I'm actually
wearing the right shirt for that so
let's talk upgrade process then the
first thing I need
was way better raid cards yes cards ooh
not a single card
there are 24 port controllers in fact
the old server has one but since each
individual SSD is capable of 500 plus
megabytes per second read and write
speeds if you hook 24 of them up to a
single card with a theoretical total
speed in the neighborhood of 12 Giga
bytes per second you're going to run
into some pretty serious bottlenecks all
over the place so after removing the
placeholder mechanical drives from the
system laborious Lee mounting 24 SSDs on
sleds and connecting the SFF 8087
connectors each of which handles four
drives to their backplane in my Norco
RPC 4224 chassis and I love these things
on Kingston's recommendation I picked up
three LSI 92 7180 I eight portrayed
cards each in a PCI Express 3.0 X slot
this is where the x99 platform really
shows its value because you're going to
need enough PCI Express Lanes to handle
all that storage bandwidth something
that consumer-grade platforms simply
cannot provide now something a lot of
people commented on when I posted a
picture of these cards on Instagram was
that these cards run really hot and I
had them installed right next to each
other don't worry I'm using a 90
millimeter fan mounted directly on top
of them for auxiliary cooling and I'll
be bolting that in before I install this
server in our fancy rack cabinet at the
new office so with all the drives
installed the next step was getting
firmware updates and drivers taking care
for my controllers and configuring
arrays naturally the first thing I did
was throw the whole thing in raid 0 for
lols to see how fast it would go there's
a bit of a special process for this in
this case though you need to create a
raid 0 array of 8 drives on each of the
controller cards then use software raid
to put them all together so in my case
that required the use of disk management
in Windows to set each raid 0 as a
dynamic drive then stripe the whole
thing together so it's kind of like raid
0 0 0 something like
that the results were well if Shania
were here I guess she'd say that don't
impress me much read speeds were great
even for 512 K transactions I'm looking
at over five and a half gigabytes per
second I mean remember this is for video
editing so very little of what we deal
with is going to be smaller than half a
Meg with 4k transfers that's more than
two full orders of magnitude faster than
my old ten hard drive solution but those
right speeds aren't enough to saturate
the planned two by ten gigabit teemed
network connection the server is packing
if multiple users are writing large
files to the array either way
raid zero wasn't my final configuration
since I wanted some fault tolerance so I
figured if I'm going to troubleshoot
this thing I might as well do it when
it's set up properly so I through my
eight driver raise in raid 5 that allows
me to lose up to one drive per array and
then I also have a spare drive on hand
in the unlikely event of a failure which
is lots for a server that'll be backed
up nightly on the network then I striped
those raid fives together in software
for what is effectively raid 50 a quick
benchmark before the arrays were
finished initializing revealed worse
numbers than raid zero although that's
pretty much a given since any parity
raid puts much more load on the
controller card especially for writes
than a striping raid but I really hadn't
expected them to be this bad so I waited
for the arrays to finish initializing
and they got worse so it was about that
time that I realized maybe the right
cache setting on solid state makes a
bigger difference than on mechanical so
even though I don't have battery backups
for my cards or a UPS for my server yet
I enabled write back cache and there we
go there is the drawback of an
unexpected power loss causing potential
data loss with right back caching
enabled but we're just going to have to
get those batteries and UPS is going
because with that setting on we are able
to saturate the bananas out of any
connection we can make on the network to
this
when she's handling large streaming
reads and writes this array can do in
excess of 5 gigabytes per second when
she's handling extremely small
transaction she can still do just under
a hundred times the performance of
Ruskin and when she's able to queue up
those small transactions from many
clients hitting her at the same time she
can do well over 500 megabytes per
second I just need to drop another $600
on battery units for the raid cards and
wait for the network cards for my
clients to show up so that I can show
you guys how the network is going to
handle all of this then the server grade
stuff is expensive and very
time-consuming but it floats my geeky
boat to see numbers like this where a
PCI Express based Predator SSD is the
bottleneck in a local file transfer
speaking of stuff that floats my geeky
boat I fix it you probably know I fix it
from there tear downs of electronic
devices and they're fantastic repair
guides on their site that can save you
tens 50s even hundreds of dollars on
repair costs I've used them a number of
times on an iMac on a phone and I'm sure
there's something else but I'm not
thinking that at the moment what you
probably aren't aware of is that I fix
it sells professional grade tools as
well so they've got their there I fix it
54 bit driver kit they've got all these
little prying tools they've got
anti-static straps they've got their
magnetic organizer that I actually might
have any yeah I was using this the other
day that lets you write little labels
draw little diagrams and keep all your
screws somewhere safe when you're
working on a project they've got all
kinds of fantastic stuff whether you're
trying to take a part in intend ODS with
a tri wing bit whether you're trying to
take apart McDonald's toys with a
triangle bit or you need to take apart
something that uses security torques is
all that stuff they've got it and what's
cool is when you go on their guides they
actually list all of the tools that you
need for a particular guide the one to
probably start with though is the kind
of all-in-one Pro Tech tool kit pack I
use mine all the time it's 65 bucks and
if you use ifixit.com slash Linus and
then code Linus zere
row five at the checkout you save $10
off.that or any purchase of $50 or more
so it's ifixit.com slash Linus check it
out great tools great guides great stuff
so that's pretty much it guys thanks for
