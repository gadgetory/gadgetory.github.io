are fun but they often require a
similarly endowed wallet in order to
afford them this can make the achieve
ability of high-end gaming rather
frustrating enter the rx 480 which may
just be the remedy you've been looking
for at the impressive price of around
200 US dollars a dose
Coon masters master Casemaker five
features the freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade on your own make it yours at the
link in the video description down below
jokes about the new rx naming aside the
new Polaris architecture named after
what is commonly known as the North Star
features AMD's new and quite capable 14
nanometer FinFET process which should be
especially helpful on the power
consumption side of things the
fourth-generation GCN architecture in
the R X 480 features 2,304 stream
processors running at a boost clock of
1266 megahertz for a peak performance of
up to 5.8 teraflops the default memory
configurations will be 4 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory running at 7 gigabits per
second on the reference config and up to
8 gigabytes again of gddr5 memory but
running at 8 gigabits per second on
other possible variations AMD has also
stated that aftermarket configs may vary
but will always feature memory clocks of
7 gigabits per second at least all that
memory will be running on a 256-bit
memory interface with a bandwidth of 224
gigabytes per second in terms of
features we now have nananananananana
watt man what man
ok that was lame and that almost fell
but it's actually kind of cool at first
it looks like just a simple overclocking
utility and it can be but it also has
some other cool stuff as well like per
voltage point frequency offsets like the
ones we recently saw toted on the nvidia
1000 series GPUs this allows you to
increase the normally linear frequency
offset curve specific amounts per
voltage point being applied to the card
this results in more control over how
your card works great it also gives you
a histogram of the last twenty minutes
of your cards activity percentage core
clock speed memory clock speed
temperature and fan speed which should
make it easier to identify issues we'll
have more fun with wot man later when we
get some aftermarket cooled cards the
card features a cooler reminiscent of
the awesome-looking aesthetic of the r9
nano but just
more cheaply there's more plastic
incorporated in the design and it in
places where the Nano would have had
shiny metal the for ID features glossy
plastic it also features an extension
beyond the slightly longer than a nano
PCB in order to add some more heatsink
space and incorporating the fan due to
this the 6 pin PCI II connector doesn't
sit at the end of the card which some
people may not like overall on the
outside I actually think it's a pretty
attractive card for this price point if
you're going for something that isn't
too in-your-face at least
also note that naturally there will be
aftermarket cards if you don't like it
for connectivity on the back there three
DisplayPort outputs compatible with DP
1.3 HB r3 and DisplayPort 1.4 HD are
then the HDMI port is HDMI 2.0 B for 4k
60 and HD are now for the current state
of crossfire and videos SLI setup with
the 1000 series and DirectX 12 was a
public relations nightmare
AMD is going to be handling things in a
very similar way but leaning heavily on
out of driver control like in explicit
modes for link display adapter mode and
multi display after mode not much here
is changing for the vast majority of
users on the AMD side in in a visible
way so just check out my video on SLI
for more info as much of it is crossover
and it's probably going to be fine
but all the features in the world aren't
worth an election in North Korea if the
performance isn't up to par so let's
take a look at some numbers and be
promised a high level of performance at
a price point of just 200 dollars and
they mostly delivered on that
performance at 1440p was mostly on par
with the GTX 970 in current titles with
the RX for 80 breaking 40 fps in all of
our benchmarks with the settings cranked
and even blew away the 970 in hitman
though that is a heavily AMD optimized
title the RX 480 is even capable of
playable frame rates at 4k with the
settings turned down a bit to around
medium now this isn't a top-end card but
it wasn't designed to be the goal was to
raise the bar at the $200 mark and given
that the cheapest GTX 970 on the market
at the time of right
this review was $260 AMD has put forth
an extremely compelling card for
budget-conscious gamers who are looking
for the quintessential Millennium Falcon
of graphics cards something isn't flashy
but has it where it counts especially
when you consider that it matches the
GTX 970 a car that was considered the
sweet spot for high-end gaming until the
10 70s release a few weeks ago and for
significantly less money I go even as
far as to say if you don't have the cash
for a GeForce 10 series and just care
about Roth performance rather than
aesthetics or manufacture exclusive
features like Ansel or SMP or something
like that there's no reason to buy GTX
970 any more now that the RX 480 is on
the market the 40 was a smart move from
AMD competing gains in videos 1080 would
have been a little crazy shooting for
the value option was smart as it fits
something that people are actually
asking for and beating out in videos
recently price dropped cards handily in
the price to performance department was
a perfect target for them to shoot for
considering how their funds have been
trending lately hopefully the community
agrees as well the K 7 xx limited
edition ruby-red headphones which are
featured over on mass drop at the link
in the video description mass drop has
actually not just that but tons of cool
products that you can check out
everything from camping supplies to
keyboards to audio products like the k7
x-axis that I'm showing off now the
concept over there is pretty simple the
more people commit to buy a given
product the lower the price of that
totally authentic product from the
manufacturer or an authorized
distributor gets boom
lots of people buy price goes down spec
wise the headphones I'm featuring today
are the same as the ones that I reviewed
last year which you can check out over
here with the only real difference being
that this run uses red accents on the
ear cups and on the headband like many
drops this is a limited time at limited
quantity drops so if you want a pair
you're going to have to act pretty fast
so check them out at the link in the
video description if you're looking for
a really nice open back comfortable pair
of headphones if you liked this video
like it if you want a shirt you can
check that out in the video description
down below and if you want to join the
forum so you can hotly debate the
hot-or-not specs of the 480 you can do
that but like debated in a friendly way
or something I guess if you want to see
another video check up here that's our
new 1070 review which is like nearly
twice the price but pretty cool I don't
know how I want to char this I'm gonna
walk this way
usually I walk that way I don't know
where I'm going</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
