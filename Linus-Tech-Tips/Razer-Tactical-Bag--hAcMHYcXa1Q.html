do they even make backpacks is this
video even gonna be good
these are all great questions but if I
didn't think it was going to be good
would I make a video about it this
graphics card for $80 makes absolutely
no sense and nobody should buy it a
product that sucks
and is cheap this magnetic box is really
nice it probably costs about as much to
make as the headphones themselves inside
you get some stickers a certificate of
gullibility our excuse me sorry I
screwed up paying $200 for half-baked
products like Nemo Wow a whole 3-pack
for only $20 however will you make a
profit on that or is it the worst kind
of snake-oil nonsense that I've seen in
quite some time
better than useless fry the existing
logo off go to town with a reinforce
turn this I think it's safe to call this
an instant masterpiece five hundred
dollars to maintain seven days of
recorded video a product that is
supposed to reduce bulk has me carrying
fuel cells a reactor a recharge station
and then something to power the recharge
station with brilliant anyway never mind
that actually uh let's just get started
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilize the
nvme standard providing speeds never
seen before on consumer storage drives
click my face or this bag to learn more
all right so it's not often that we
tackle the backpack category and every
time we do I like to think that there's
some kind of a fresh reason for it there
was the one with an integrated battery
bank the one with a pelican grade laptop
compartment and before that a couple of
over key bags that were just playing
great value for the dollar but today's
video is not about any of those things
at a hundred and sixty dollars the Razr
tactical bag is not going to win any
performance per dollar awards especially
when you consider that the primary
performance metric for a bag is
literally just carrying stuff so we
could pretty easily create something
with a better price to performance ratio
but the reason I'm making this video is
because whatever you guys might think
about this fact as Linus it's pretty
darn easy for me to get a key per unit
of any product I want from a high margin
category like backpacks and for eight
years I have faithfully stood by my
Windows Vista ojio bag due to its
quality comfort timeless style and did I
mention quality that thing has been a
tank and I had no intention of replacing
it until it just kind of happened by
accident when I booked my dinner with
min tan from razor in March he
congratulated me on my new blade 14 and
asked me if I had one of their backpacks
to go with it to which I replied no and
before I could say and I'm really not
interested in one since that's just
another stupid thing to carry all over
Asia with me for the next two and a half
weeks he said oh okay cool I'll bring
one to dinner for you so he handed it to
me when I arrived and it was actually
kind of love at first sight I moved all
my gear over and haven't looked back for
a moment so then what's so special about
it frankly not that much it's just a
really well executed bag with lots of
versatile pockets and rugged enough
construction that it looks like it'll
last me another 10 years or more
just like my og oh not to mention it's
much more comfortable than my old bag so
let's take a tour of it shall we
all backpacks start for me at the
contact point with your back and the
tactical bag excels here it's designed
to be worn properly it features a chest
strap that makes you look like a Dorcas
but it's totally worth it when you have
a lot of weight in your bag and with the
shoulder straps snug but not tight and
restrictive there are decent pads
positioned on either side of my spine
and in the small of my back
I think I'd pay an extra 10 bucks for
these to be a denser foam but solid
placement of it made this backpack
comfortable even during long days
walking around bird sanctuary zoos and
like in Asia the same can be said of the
padding on the shoulder straps I do wish
it was thicker but the functionality of
it is still a strong point moving around
to the side we've got a buckle whose
purpose is unclear and the large side
pocket that I generally use for stuff I
don't want to get lost in the main
compartment but that I don't really need
to get to all the time like my
toiletries and medications while
traveling a great feature of these is
that even though they're held down by
Velcro nature's untimely point of
failure you can optionally run a strap
through the cover to lock it in place on
the bottom is a rain cover that thanks
to the water resistance of the bags
ballistic nylon construction you'll only
need in very wet conditions then at the
front there's this whoa that's a lot of
elk roe isn't it this velcro loop system
allows any front mounted pockets to be
modularly rearranged and allows you to
put the included razor stickers on it
wherever you want or more importantly
allows you to just take them right off
if you don't need quite as many logos
all over your backpack these pockets are
the perfect size for a mouse which is
nice but I think Razer missed an
opportunity to put a clever water bottle
holder here next we'll open up the
organizer compartment by opening the two
really nice smooth feeling zippers to
reveal a scratch proof tablet pouch and
four main organization zones one is for
business cards or other little random
things I wish these were deeper by the
way then below that is a neoprene pocket
that's perfect for my 10,000 milliamp
hour battery bank and the cup
dedicated USB Drive holders on the other
side is a mesh pocket random stuff you
need easily goes here and then below
that a similar pocket but with a zipper
this time for SD cards small adapters
and other stuff but you really don't
want to be fishing around for when you
need them
razor missed the boat on not including
anywhere to put a writing implement but
the good news is the rest of the bottom
of this pouch is big enough that I can
easily throw all my mini screwdrivers in
and a pen if I so desire the top pouches
are accessed by undoing the clips that
hold down the zipper cover and inside
the main compartment you'll find not a
whole heck of a lot there's a protective
divider in here that'll allow books or
documents to be stored safely a little
loop at the top for hanging something
and then once you remove the four most
people bulky and not super useful
headphone container thing it's just
straight up cargo space exactly the way
I like it which leads us finally to the
last pouch for your laptop or notebook
it can hold up to a 17.3 inch
monstrosity it features a little bit of
padding at the bottom but other than
that no extra gimmicks just a laptop
pouch which is surprising because I
would have expected no offense
someone like Razer to try and have some
of those geek backpack features like
headphone wiring cable management holes
and stuff like that but instead they
stuck with a practical no-nonsense
design as though the person in charge of
the product has actually had the
experience of ripping their earbuds out
when they forgot they had their discman
cable managed in their backpack in high
school not that I speak from experience
speaking of speaking I'm speaking to you
now about ting comm they're the mobile
carrier that is focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction first
you call them and you don't speak to a
robot you speak directly to a person you
pay only for what you use and that's at
a reasonable rate the average ting bill
is only $24 a month per device and if
you're stuck in a contract and switch to
ting they will cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to 75 bucks so head
over to ting calm and try out their
savings calculator to find out how much
you
save and when you sign up at our link in
the video description by the way you'll
also get $25 in service credit or $25
towards a new device I wonder if they're
gonna adopt that as their new slogan
ting comm whoa probably not anyway
that's the razer tactical bag did you
guys enjoy this look at a product from
an unusual category for us do you have a
favorite bag that you'd like to see me

want me to rub it around on it a little
bit for you
