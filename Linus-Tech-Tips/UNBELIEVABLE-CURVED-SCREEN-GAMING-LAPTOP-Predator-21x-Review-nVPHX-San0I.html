market has been expanding even exploding
in recent years and it seems now pretty
much everybody and their dog has a
laptop with a gtx 1080 desktop edition
or even two of them in sli so how do you
set yourself apart from the crowd
well Acer decided to conjure forth the
purest maddest gaming laptop ever
created gaze upon the predator 21x and
tremble puny mortals
the master keys pro keyboard lineup from
Coolermaster is available in three sizes
each in white or RGB flavours check them
out at the link below alright so we
really can't go any further without
addressing the display it's freaking
amazing
it's a 21 inch curved ultra wide display
on a laptop when you open this thing up
it is immediately clear it means
business while it does have a little bit
of backlight bleed it's bright has great
viewing angles and vivid colors and the
120 Hertz refresh rate along with g-sync
compatibility cements it as the laptop
gaming display to end all laptop gaming
displays and speaking of games if your
game dips below 120 FPS well you can
pretty much blame the developers since
this baby packs more power than your
average split atom dual power breaks
feed the two GTX 1080s in sli a core i7
7820 HK quad core 2 nvme SSDs in raid 0
and 64 gigabytes of ddr4 memory so these
specs and the monitor make playing
frantic games like doom extra awesome
with no perceptible input lag and colors
popping like the overripe pustules
dotting the cranium of a demon IO Palmer
edit is also near desktop class but
there's a bunch of way cooler stuff that
we want to get to so we're going to kind
of gloss over that in games this thing
crushed everything we threw at it
regularly getting into the hundreds of
frames per second while running it ultra
settings the ultra wide display made all
those frames even more sweet X
in Deus Ex in directx12 where things
outside of the 16 by 9 aspect ratio kind
of D rendered now since Acer was the
first one to include an ultra wide
display on a laptop we had to actually
step it down to sixteen by nine and
rerun all of our benchmarks in order to
do direct comparisons against anything
else
good news for Acer though even compared
to other top laptops the predator 21 X
took no prisoners although to be clear
it is still not quite able to take on a
desktop running GTX 1080s in SLI and it
should also be noted that these
benchmarks were taken with the fans on
what we call jet engine mode more about
that soon so if you expect it to be
quiet you might see frame rates that are
a little bit lower thermals then the
predator 21 X's thermals surprisingly
actually aren't that amazing when you
leave it on the auto setting it does
keep it nice and quiet but it falls into
the same CPU thermal limiting issues
that all of the hyper laptops seem to
run up against with a bit of throttling
when running i-264 but if you have the
fans to max aka
hope you have active noise-cancelling
headphones because that may teen is
taking off in your backyard mode the
internals are kept nice and cool which
you'd hope would be the case because
there are five fans and nine freaking
heat pipes I mean don't get me wrong
here with a machine like this I expect
you're going to love the noise because
this isn't Civic with a hole in the
muffler this is Ferrari v12 as it
screams at over 8,000 rpm and you can
make it roar any time you want with the
oh yeah four speakers and two subwoofers
this is the loudest laptop I've ever
heard in every possible way even the
keyboard is fully mechanical with Cherry
MX brown switches
and with the wrist rest attached it
actually feels like typing on a
standalone mechanical keyboard now the
astute among you might have noticed
there isn't a trackpad but have no fear
all you got to do is lift up the number
pad and turn it around if you've
forgotten your mouse pretty sweet
now the predator 21x also features Toby
eye tracking which allows for dynamic
lighting and aiming depending on where
you're looking
and as more games begin to support it I
can see this becoming a really cool
feature but at the moment it doesn't do
a whole heck of a lot routine
disassembly of the 21x is actually
relatively easy with only one screw
required to remove the top panel giving
you access to the spinning storage and
half of the RAM opening up the bottom
requires removing three screws and gives
you access to the four MDOT to drive
blaze plus the rest of the RAM this is
all that can be easily accessed though
and any other internal components are
only possible to reach through pretty
much a full disassembly so then by this
point in the video you must be thinking
to yourself wait a second line is that
17.8 pounds isn't portability kind of
out the window and the answer is No
fortunately Acer thought of this and
they included this incredibly convenient
custom Pelican case with every 21 X it's
compact size and ergonomic wheels and
handles mean taking the 21 X with you on
the go is almost simple and it can fit
in the trunk of your average van with
ease joking aside though the 21 X is
still considerably easier to pack up
than a full desktop computer and with
the hardware it's packing that is really
not an unjust comparison
so if you want full-on performance at a
LAN party or if you move around a fair
bit it's actually a pretty incredible
option I was slightly worried that the
curved monitor would be easily damaged
when more casual transportation though
like say in a backpack but during our
testing we actually found that it
remained quite sturdy even when you put
pressure on it using it on your lap go
figure it is a laptop still is
surprisingly comfortable that is to say
until your legs start to go numb and if
you roll up in the coffee shop to do
some work it does work even if you might
get a couple of funny looks but bottom
line then should you get one well really
it's more of a question of can you get
one to which the answer is probably no
first of all it costs $9,000 which is
enough to get you at this time 608
shares and Acer or to many trucks and
second they're only making three hundred
of them of which I already have one so
if you didn't order one already chances
are you're out of luck but the Acer
predator 21x isn't about practical
things like price availability noise
weight thinness general usability
professional appearance it's a
chest-thumping piece this was about Acer
delivering the craziest gaming
experience that anyone's ever seen in a
laptop and I have to say this mission
accomplished Acer I absolutely love this
thing
Dollar Shave Club the concept here is
very very simple hair grows out of your
face or other parts of your body you got

on the cheap and in a way that's
convenient
