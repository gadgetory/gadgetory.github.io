of effort and a lot of time to get to
three but now we know that at least it's
possible congratulations AMD on making
it to three even if you had to count
backwards from seven and skip a few
numbers in between meets risin three the
entry level su to the team in blue
browse privately and securely with
Tunnel bear the simple VPN app starts
your 7-day free trial at the link in the
video description so if you've been
living under a rock for the past six
months like I did that one time
this release might have snuck up on you
it's okay we get it
money doesn't grow on trees you got
bills to pay and mouths to feed my right
well AMD figures there's a lot of truth
to that and rise in three the final
piece of the puzzle comes in at a
hundred and ten to a hundred and thirty
dollars and if you look at what Intel is
done with KB Lakes Pentium lineup it is
clear that they saw this coming and felt
like they needed to react where Pentium
CPUs have been to core to thread only
affairs for several generations now the
CPUs that compete with rising three on
pricing are going to fourth red using
hyper threading for the first time
blurring the lines between Pentium and
core i3 which crap I guess I'm finally
going to have to redo this
three-year-old video but if Intel's
response even adequate rise in three
very pointedly doesn't have simultaneous
multithreading but is instead a full-on
quad-core CPU made up of two of AMD's n
compute complexes or CC X's this means
that while it has only half the
- of its rise in five and rise in seven
cousins it has all the same features
that they provide like sense MI
precision boost and XFR though since AMD
is still disabling course symmetrically
cache latency is technically higher than
if they had used a single CC X with 4
cores and as we showed an hour rise in 5
review while this method saves AMD some
cost it also reduces the amount of total
bandwidth available to the cache so the
question becomes will we see an
appreciable loss in performance and if
so can rise and 3 keep up with the best
team blue has to offer within this price
bracket well AMD considers the closest
price competitor to the rise in 3 1300 X
to be the core i3 7300 and the Rison 3
1200 to be the core i3 70 100 and from a
pricing standpoint this is roughly
correct as for performance though AMD
actually managed to pull out a solid win
thanks to rising 3 is a multi-threaded
performance especially at these prices
consistently in nearly every area that
doesn't involve purely single threaded
performance both rise and three chips
handily beat out both of their Intel
competitors unfortunately for AMD that
doesn't include most current games where
dual core Core i3 s are able to pull off
higher frame rates but with that said
our use of a clean windows image for our
testing doesn't tell us how background
processes might affect gaming
performance on a system that actually
has just two cores versus four true
cores but even ignoring that when you
crunch the numbers and look at the value
proposition Rison 3 makes a lot of sense
not only does the 1300 X never
or fall behind it's Team Blue rival the
risin three 1200 also makes a great
showing it is certainly looking very
bright
overall for risin three when you look at
the big picture and there's yet another
trick up rising sleeve and that's
overclocking unlike Intel whose CPUs
probably have a ton of headroom in them
but are locked for overclocking unless
you shell out for a K series rise m3 is
fully unlocked just like the rise in v
and rise in seven lineups and when you
spend a little bit of time doing some
tuning gaming performance comes much
closer to Team Blue not to mention that
it also further increases AMD's lead in
multi-threaded non-gaming benchmarks our
rise in three 1200 managed to overclock
past the 1300 X's stock clocks making it
an incredible value at this speed and
this price though as always with
overclocking your mileage may vary and
some additional investment is required
for overclocking you'll need an
overclocking compatible motherboard
chipset and a decent cooler the race
self included in the box is fine but
it's not enough to handle a voltage bump
big enough to comfortably overclock it
all the way to the Mac so be prepared to
spend a little more if you want to
squeeze some extra juice out of your
rise and three should you pick one up
and pick one up you probably should the
platform's matured a lot and Rises three
rips back the budget market that AMD has
come to rely on since Sandy Bridge and
while like the rest of its family it
doesn't exactly dominate it throws a big
ole Randy Johnson curve ball at Team
Blue and provides a legitimate
alternative to value shoppers who still
want great performance we are partnering
with razor at LTX 2017 to host a razor
goliath us most match design contest
the theme is well me we're going to see
who can design the best Linus tech tips
themed razor Goliath Espace
attendees of lpx will be able to submit
their designs online razer will select
the top four and then it will be up to
you to vote on which one is the best if
you haven't gotten your ticket for LTX
2017 you still can at the link below
we're hosting it here in Langley BC
Canada there's going to be tons of cool
stuff with some exclusive unboxings
including a very special one from Razer
and something about teasing an upcoming
review don't miss it I don't know what
that means
