actually wanted to do for quite a while
and I've received a number of requests
to do now I know that I unboxed the FTO
3 mini a long time ago and I promised at
the time of unboxing it that I would do
an ITX build guide in that case and it
took like months to get it done but I
would like to remind you guys that I
eventually did get it done so when I'm
committing now to do a micro ATX build
guide in the SGO 9 I don't know how soon
it'll get done but it will get done at
some point so there you go
I am committing that to you silverstone
has to be one of the most under
appreciated case manufacturers in a lot
of ways so number one is you guys have
no idea what it costs in terms of the
tooling and design costs to bring a new
case to market it is a boatload of money
and silverstone releases new case
designs all the time trying to
constantly innovate and constantly do
things differently they also do a lot of
stuff that only has niche appeal where
they'll be like okay let's build like
the craziest smallest ITX enclosure that
can hold a ball and graphics card like
they did with the FTO 3 mini and also
cools exceptionally well like they did
with the FT 300 ft or 3 mini or they'll
take something to be like let's turn
like the motherboard on its side 90
degrees and so they do like this crazy
stuff and they take they take Gamble's
because it costs them even if they never
actually sell a case it still costs them
hundreds of thousands of dollars to
bring that case to market which has
nothing to do with even so so let's say
even they sell a hundred case a hundred
cases are a thousand cases like they the
margin doesn't justify the development
cost in a lot of cases unless it really
takes off so they take Gamble's they
bring things to market and I think we
have to appreciate that because they do
unique stuff
so there's your sort of history lesson
on Silverstone and what they do and this
folks is the SGO nine which is intended
to be a super small super awesome
airflow micro ATX case so you can see
airflow is the name of the game with
this guy we've got huge vents on the
front huge vents on the side all down
the bottom here all up the top here huge
vent on the top these look like very
very large fan fan holes once we get it
opened up we'll have a better idea
what's going on and a 120 at the back so
this is like an air cooling box so let's
have a look at what silverstone has to
say for themselves and then we'll move
on to the case itself so dual speed fan
switch on the rear pane 120mm fan
included independent harddrive and SSD
compartment behind the motherboard tray
love it
supports full sized CPU coolers up to
165 mils air penetrator ap 181 fan is
included very nice very good fan slim
optical drive bay is included right up
at the top detachable front power supply
fan filter so your power supply goes
right in the front full-size ATX power
supply is supported dedicated triple GPU
fan slots with removable filter and four
expansion slots accommodate top-end
graphics cards up to thirteen point
three inches long which is about as long
as they get these days guys full
graphics card ample fans love bubble you
do Boo Boo's you okay yeah let's move on
all right
the case itself so that is the front
that is your power supply intake so I
have a feeling we're going to find a
very very unique internal layout here
when I go get my screwdriver and I can
take off the thumb screws on the back so
exterior first the front is plastic so
that is a plastic bezel however they're
using that brushed plastic that I happen
to really like so it's got kind of a
like a brushed feel to it the place
where it's missing that finish is up
here on that power supply intake as well
as here where the slim slot loading
optical drive goes so that's a little
bit disappointing but it's not the end
of the world it doesn't look too bad
I'd love it if it was a metal front but
this would be very expensive to do at a
metal Silverstone logo here power and
reset buttons on the left and the right
two USB 3 front ports as well as front
headphones and front microphone I
already kind of showed this but it's
okay so the
is probably something to do with the
motherboard tray back mounted SSD mounts
you can see how much room there is
behind the motherboard tray so I'm
expecting to find pretty good cable
management in there this up here looks
like it has a little like handle here so
you can yeah there you go you can get
batt get that whoopsy daisies get that
over there so it was an included 180
millimeter air penetrator if I recall
correctly yeah that's a 180 millimeter
air penetrator that's blowing air down
onto the CPU area as well as down onto
the back of the graphics card where
it'll be exhausted this way so they're
going for a little bit of a different
air flow layout with this case go ahead
and snap that back into place
then on this side there's that triple
fan thing that they set up so it looks
like a 120 and dual 80s that's going to
be dedicated to cooling the graphics
card as well as more ventilation here so
these were a little bit tight from the
factory but loosening them with a
screwdriver has got that taken care of
and this is something that I haven't
really seen before it looks like we can
remove pretty much every panel except
for a little bit down here to almost
completely open up the case for for
installations so you know what let's
just see if there's any documentation I
mean with the oh I think it was the gdo
8 as well as the fto 3 mini a couple
Silverstone cases I've looked at
recently they specifically said in the
instructions this is a unique case don't
even bother trying to assemble your
system in here without some help
so yeah something something carefully
prepared by yet and they do such good
manuals so they're like yep here here's
all the different things here's a little
addendum this is how you disassemble it
blown-up view of it how it goes back
together so eighty or ninety two mil
fans on the side there reset button 180
mil sent okay I'll be back in a moment
babies crying okay so I removed all the
screws from the back but I realized
there's actually one more that you have
to remove here to get the top cover off
so we were in the middle of figuring out
how the whole thing comes apart so this
is sort of one big u-shaped piece that
all comes off and I see much like the FT
o3 this case could present some
challenges even for experienced builders
because of the you
Niq way that it all fits together so
this guy is done with two separate
screws so you can either take it off or
not take it off it's totally up to you
and by two separate screws what I meant
to say was three separate screws because
there's one more on the bottom here
there we go so let's take those off and
then so we can either remove those or
not remove them and we are going to do
that just for the sake of getting this
going here so you can do either a 120
and you can see there's an air
penetrator included a 120 and two 80s or
92 s or you can do three eighty s or
three 92 s it's totally up to you I hope
that I'm correct about that and I'm
totally wrong so it's a 120 and and one
120 Bubba bla bla bla backwards
compatible with 92 and then 280 slash
not yeah it claims to be yeah okay oh
there they are there they are I see the
holes but it doesn't do 80s so you can
do 92 92 92 or 120 92 92 120 80 80 and
this case uses extremely fine fan
filters so they're almost more like a
nylon than an actual plastic you can see
there's some act like there's some
shiftiness to them here so these should
be doing a really good job of us right
it's just going to check the direction
there these should do a really good job
of filtering even very fine particles
out of the air that goes into your case
which is important for that concept of
positive air pressure so you can see the
way they've configured these fans
this guy's an intake this big guy up
here the big 180 millimeter is also okay
baby is also an intake and then the only
exhaust is this 120 at the back as well
as the power supply itself so that means
you're going to have overall positive
air flow combined with filtered intakes
you should have a very dust free
internal environment very solid
construction on this guy overall like
you can see there's no there's no flex
to the materials given that there's not
a whole lot to speak of here so it's
quite a thick steel all the corners are
rounded like that so you're not going to
risk cutting yourself or anything I
remember when I used to work with cheap
cases all the time I always used to have
the cuts just all over my hands and you
know people ask me what's going on and
I'd be like no no I'm fine don't worry
on the back we've got to
by two so for total two and a half inch
drive mounts then we have some
additional optional accessories which
I'm just going to have to go ahead and
cheat and look at the manual and I'll be
back in a minute as I said before the
guide included is so detailed it goes
through and gives you a mean it gives
you great little tips these are the
kinds of things you never find in
installation guides it has a dedicated
step called we recommend deciding
whether or not to install the right side
fan now and then there's another one
that's like awesome as well because it
basically just says this is this is the
point where you need to start thinking
about cable routing before you before
you keep going make sure you're doing
things tightly I don't remember where it
is anyway on the back you mount two
three and a half inch drives here and
you can see they've given ample thought
see you right there little bit of air
flows coming right over the hard drives
so that they're going to be positioned
in such a way that they're going to get
cooling and then the bottoms of the hard
drives have a little bit of space down
here where you can route the wires that
you need around here these guys right
here hold those for two and a half inch
and again it doesn't really matter that
much whether you have that much airflow
over here so I personally wouldn't I
really like this design it's great so
you can put that 80 mil fan here that is
not a filtered intake however it's yeah
is not so it's probably one that I
wouldn't really recommend using let it
be like a passive exhaust or install an
exhaust fan there as another option so
it gives you instructions for removing
the power supply cage itself so you can
see the way the power supply is going to
be positioned will have this plug right
here which is a right angle plug plug
into the back of the power supply it'll
intake at the front of the case and then
it will exhaust out the side of the case
right there so it'll come right out the
side and none of that air is ever going
to affect the cooling of the internal
components your slot load DVD drive goes
up here and guys remember we are going
to be doing a build guide in this case
so don't worry if you're if you're
missing any of these steps now that it's
down to the bare skeleton you can see
our internal connectors so we've got an
internal USB 3 as well as all your usual
front panel connectors including front
audio we've got fan connectors for the
included fans and you can also see here
just how much space there is they also
give you fantastic tips like a lot of
people ask me this and the answer I
usually give is well
depends on your case they say oh I have
a I have a case fan over my graphics
card area should I use it as an exhaust
or as an intake Silverstone gives you
examples of a variety of different fan
configurations that you can find on
graphics cards which hopefully I will
component size limitations they cover
all of that as well as here we go more
component size limitations types of
cables that are optimal so they
recommend using straight cables they
show you types of CPU coolers how to
recommend it there you go
so they say ok this this is how you do
it this kind or this kind this is how
you do it and they let you sort of make
your own best judgment that way they
also tell you you know don't use two
cards in SLI or crossfire that are
sandwich too close together so the way
that they recommend is say for example
you go to GTX 590 which is going to
exhaust some of the back and out here so
you'd want to use a couple here as an
intake and then this one has an exhaust
and let the passive exhaust go out the
back of the i/o for that side
motherboard tray is fairly solid about
what I'd expect from Silverstone and I
think that pretty much covers it so the
idea was for them to do a micro ATX case
which is capable of an SLI or crossfire
configuration within I think they set
out a design spec for themselves of 23
litres total internal capacity remember
guys this case is probably smaller
internally than a bit Phoenix prodigy
and actually accommodates a pretty
high-end configuration now it doesn't
have those same liquid cooling options
available but you would still be able to
get away with a thick 120 millimeter
radiator here and with some more
creativity you could probably do like an
80 mil rad there and who knows you could
even maybe ceiling mount something if
you put it sort of over here on the side
and figured out a way to mount it so
there's a lot of room in here for all
kinds of cool stuff thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the SGO 9 from silverstone don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for more unboxings reviews and I'm going
to have hard time putting this back
together and other computer videos I
think there's one more thing I haven't
showed you that I would like to show you
before we do wrap things up here's at
the back how do you actually connect
your power supply via the outside it
goes right there so that's that pastor
that I showed you that connects to
internal power supply which goes here
and then you can see from the front so
you better make sure you pick a power
supply that's not you know like great
and I actually did end up forgetting a
couple things guys so they even include
things like a little duct if you want to
use a 25 millimeter thick fan on the
side so yeah you can bridge the gap so
that it gets a little bit closer to your
GPU delivers the air right to it
includes rubber feet for the bottom so
those are super super grippy which is
good all your included screws I can't
believe I didn't cover this mine did the
actual unboxing USB 3 2 USB 2 adapter if
your motherboard doesn't have front USB
3 some cable ties this is cool so single
molex to 3 3 pins for those 3 fans right
there as well as one'd it's a bracket
for converting from 180 to 140
millimeter and this is for the slim
obstacle okay now don't forget to
subscribe
oh yeah in these these are evidently for
adhesive spacers for nine and a half
inch slim optical drive installation so
you get four of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
