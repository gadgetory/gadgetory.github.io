inch displays and let me tell you it is
a pretty cool experience I've got the
lights out I hope you can see the I just
got hit because i'm not paying attention
I'm yeah this is actually cool sorry
this is this is my first time trying it
like I haven't tried it before before
shooting the video so I'm just sort of
giving my impressions was that really
the whole fight it's been a while since
i've actually played this game so no
maybe Joker's going to send another wave
of baddies at me at some point but yeah
I'm actually using the Phantom lap board
which the cameraman wants to check out
is here in my lap so I've got the laser
mouse down below it right here and then
I've got the keyboard positioned sort of
comfortably on my lap you can use the
rotation to you know sort of hold the
mouse wherever you're comfortable and
then have the keyboard sit wherever you
like it too I'm just gonna sort of kill
some baddies here go boom leaping around
this is like way too easy on this game
though
anyway there you have it batman arkham
asylum in i don't know how many inches
that is we should find out I affinity</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
