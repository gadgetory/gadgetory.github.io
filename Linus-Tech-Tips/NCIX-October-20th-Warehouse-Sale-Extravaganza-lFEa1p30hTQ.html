stuff so this is where you'll find
things like business grade grade cards I
saw some of them before I'll find them
I'll find them don't worry I'll go find
them but you know more networking

four port 92 40 remember guys that is a
hardware raid 5 controller part here
we've got these are these are crazy
check these up so these are 4-way DVI
7.1 audio kvms so you've got three of
them they're a hundred bucks so think
about that that means you could have a
full home like three full computers
operating off of like a 5.1 or 7.1 audio
setup with DVI and that that's pretty
cool keyboards are good deals actually I
saw a couple that were outstanding
including the where'd it go where's ah

so this is off limits but Ian and I will
be just kind of going through there no
big deal
more cases wall no more cases Ian and

there and I'm gonna point out some of
the things that I think are outstanding

stuff look at this raven RV oh one for
90 bucks which is just an awesome
awesome case now I think that pretty
much oh no wait
here's a liquid-cooled thermaltake
level-10 GT so LCS means it has the
built in liquid cooling for 160 bucks so
that's kind of cool
personally I'm not a big thermal take
liquid cooling guy but it's okay
monitors lots of good monitor deals tons
of Pro Art Series monitor
a sous pro art series monitors are pre
calibrated so there's a few 23 inch ones
there's a huge one there's a 24 inch one
there there's I think there's a couple
more 24 inches here this is an IPS this
is a 23 inch but not pro art series
there's also I saw a couple 3d ones yeah
where's the 3d ones so here's a 3d 24 20
T for 160 bucks here's a 3d 27 inch from
Acer although if I was gonna pick one of
them I'd go with the Ben Q because this
one support slight boost whereas the
Acer one behind me does not as always
there are 1 bajillion and one cheap
motherboards p67 board for 25 bucks
you've got handy board for ya m5 a 97

we have any high-end stuff yeah here we
go so you can get Maximus v formula so
this is a z77 this is a current board
for over $100 off which is pretty cool
gigabyte z77 boards $55 actually those
are probably some of the better deals
I've seen so far for the motherboards Oh
what's this neck here 24 port gigabit
smart switch for one-third of regular
price huh web-based management interface
and the rack mount kit so if you're
looking for something like that that's
actually that's outstanding as well $10
video card what else we got here so 79
70s are around the 350 dollar price
range 7950 for 200 bucks that's a good
deal
what are these 68 50s those are okay

so GTX 680 for 319 bucks fantastic deal
someone better go for that one right
away uh what else
Radeon 68-54 79 79 okay 70 77479 that's
not bad actually if you're looking for
something more entry-level and then yeah
that pretty much covers it for those so
let's go around swing around the back
finish off our tour actually not quite
there still it's still a few more things
so here's all the big stuff weird stuff
like for you rack mount servers case for
15 bucks that's a Norco case sure why
not right cheap printers galore over
year so $60 multifunction laser printer
station and if you if you're sort of
pricing it by the pound then it probably
looks pretty good
a couple Lenovo all-in-one these are
neat oh this this is crazy I couldn't
believe this when I saw this 70 bucks
gets you a shuttle x58 bare-bones PC so
that includes power supply and
motherboard and case so you throw like a
nine-point like an old nine 20 in there
and triple channel memory kit that is a
fantastic deal lots of routers another

a couple a sue so play minis and then
more motherboards some Intel boards

the drone v2 is out now and notebooks
I'm going to see if I can find the 99
oldest hole someone's got to buy this
zonar dgx headphone amp sound card 19
bucks buy it just buy it because that's
a fantastic deal if you have headphones
just buy it so notebooks 149 for this
one what's that so that's an Intel
Pentium something 13.3 inch there you go
it comes with Windows Vista but I guess
you can always install another OS on it
if you don't like Vista these are cool
little wireless wireless air keyboard
thing you just kind of point it like
this to use the mouse pointer you're
using it at your TV for example the
other side more notebooks
so here's notebooks for a hundred and
seventy bucks what are these atom
notebooks and then we've got here's the
$99 one that's an Aspire One mini
notebook and got some Samsung some
ThinkPads let's go over here to the TV
so this is $600 which is apparently $400
off so it's a Samsung 6000 series 46
inch TV I think it was a demo unit yeah
there you go there's a demo unit before
so no no particular sort of beat up nice
going
hard drives Seagate Barracuda 2
terabytes 50 bucks
half price Seagate Barracuda 2 terabytes
50 bucks so there's lots of those highly
encourage you guys to check those I
would hit happy desk stars 70 bucks for
2 terabytes and we attach these Fitz is
a bit more of a premium in these things
these are kind of interesting 90 bucks
gets you surveillance grade hard drives
which are actually quite expensive these
