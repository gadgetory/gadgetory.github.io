new performance profiles and a graphics
card upgrade to the recently released
gtx 970m 3 gig we figured and msi agreed
but it was finally time to take the GS
70 stealth for a spin in our studio the
red anodized finish on this stunning
device didn't hurt matters either the
cooler master Neptune 240 M features an
exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more
we'll start with a specs rundown there's
a bit of a variety here but the one that
I've got is top of the line except for
storage it's got a Core i7 47 10 HQ
processor that runs at 2.5 gigahertz
nominal and 3.5 gigahertz boost 16 gigs
of ddr3 memory in two slots max 384 gigs
worth of raid 0 SSD goodness that was
able to achieve sequential read speeds
of well over 1 gigabyte per second for
the OS with a one terabyte hard drive
for larger programs and mass storage
hardline gigabit networking and 802.11
AC both with welcomes killer packet
prioritization for gaming and a gtx 970m
graphics card giving you more
performance than a last generation
top-of-the-line 880 and equipped
notebook with less power and less heat
output but none of this would be that
impressive if it wasn't for the physical
design of this gaming sheet yes I even
came up with a new name for pancake thin
gaming notebooks gaming sheets so let's
do a bit of a physical tour the profile
of the notebook is less than 2 point 2
centimeters and weighs under 6 pounds
thanks to its aluminum magnesium alloy
casing making it about as lean and mean
as anything else on the market this top
cover features a MSI gaming logo that I
actually kind of hated at first but it's
sort of grown on me over the last year
or so and an otherwise extremely clean
brushed aluminum finish the bottom has a
similar finish with a port for the
bottom subwoofer vent holes for the dual
side exhausting
I'm fans and this weird velvety material
that perplexed me at first and I'm just
sitting there using the thing of it oh
yeah it's so it doesn't slide off your
lap when you've got it sitting on your
thighs flippin brilliant and say
whatever you want about the red color I
personally think it's drop-dead gorgeous
and a very positive move away from the
standard black notebook with accent
colour that everyone's been doing for at
least the last 100 bazillion years it
manages to be extremely eye catching
without that body only 14-year olds
would like it look about it that many
gaming products managed to be stuck with
and if you don't like red well it's
available in black and silver too anyway
I guess in terms of Io both sides are
taken up with a surprisingly complete
configuration with the left side
equipped with the Gigabit Ethernet port
HDMI out dual mini DisplayPort yeah
that's a total of three concurrent 4k
displays - at 60 Hertz one at 30 Hertz
two USB 3 ports and gold-plated audio
jacks and then on the right side we find
a Kensington lock a somewhat awkwardly
placed power input for the 150 watt
power brick that's still pretty sizable
but at least similar in thickness to the
notebook it powers and finally an SD
card reader and two more USB 3 ports and
now it's time to get inside this little
beauty around the 17 inch display is
more tastefully plain designed with only
an MSI logo and a 1080p 30fps webcam
it's low light performance isn't as good
as its well-lit performance but I still
think that's a nice inclusion with the
way that webcams have turned into a spec
list checkbox item rather than a quality
Hardware add-on which leads us to the
million dollar question how is that 17
inch display well it's 1080p so if you
were hoping for a 3k or 4k display then
you will be disappointed but I
personally think 1080p is still a good
place for the 970m and it's TN so if you
were hoping for IPS then you'll be
disappointed by that - but there is some
good news here well the vertical viewing
angles aren't amazing at this size with
how easy it is to adjust the vertical
angle of a notebook display I don't
consider this to be a deal breaking
issue and horizontal viewing angles are
surprisingly good
if you're sitting on the couch watching
a movie with your bow you'll both be
able to enjoy it rather than you know
who gets to watch without the colors
inverted being an indicator for who
wears the pants in your relationship
speaking of colors I liked the
multicolored backlit keyboard by
SteelSeries the first time I saw it and
I still liked it today
each of the keyboards three zones can be
individually lit whatever color you want
at any of the four possible brightness
levels turned off or set up with a
variety of lighting patterns including
breathing and color cycling it's a nice
little touch of flair and
personalization and since it doesn't
have a negative impact on the keyboard
layout which other than the missing
media controls I really like by the way
nice standard key layout with proper
arrow keys and a full numpad or the
surprisingly solid tactile response now
I don't really see a downside since if
you don't care about it you can just set
it to one color forever and just use the
SteelSeries engine utility for rebinding
whatever keys you want setting up macros
or whatever else it is you want to do
you don't have to touch the color for
bloatware I was ready to give the GS 70s
Delta B - for norton being installed and
having links to wild tangent and MSI's
YouTube channel and Facebook page in the
modern UI start menu but MSI's
performance monitor that they also
include is lightweight and somewhat
useful and the machine comes with a 6
month license for xsplit gamecaster
included so i'm going to bump that up to
a B+ useful bundled applications with
trial periods that are long enough to
not just be considered a try before you
buy demo are actually worth marks to me
here which leads us to that useful thing
in MSI's control center at their new
shift functionality the general concept
here isn't really anything new different
performance and fan profiles depending
on your tolerance for noise and heat but
it works really seamlessly just function
f7 to switch between sport comfort or
green mode and you go from a higher
temps and pretty loud and whiny too but
with better performance down to lower
temps quieter and much less whining with
less performance of course it should be
noted though that these modes only work
when plugged into AC power but there's a
video
GPU boosts 2.0 when you're on battery
anyway which lets you throttle
performance depending on your tolerance
for lower frame rate targets and in-game
details when you're on battery in order
to get more on-the-go gaming out of your
PC in my experience it works for
anywhere from a negligible improvement
for really demanding games that we're
going to max out the GPU regardless to
well over 50% more life if you really
scale things back or you're playing
something that's not very demanding like
league of legends so conclusion time I
guess who is the gs70 still for well I'd
say anyone who's willing to pay a
premium over the more traditional brick
style gaming notebook for what is in my
mind a more portable and more visually
appealing design with similar
performance not quite the same but at
the cost of component temperatures the
outside stayed within reason but our CPU
got up to around 90 degrees in sport
mode with CPU and GPU benchmarks running
at the same time something that won't
really happen during gains where we
topped out around 65 degrees but might
be a concern if you're a content creator
who uses both CPU power and CUDA for
video or 3d production at the same time
the good news though is that our CPU
didn't go under 2.9 gigahertz turbo on
all 4 cores when stressing CPU RAM and
GPU so no throttling is a very good
thing now the laptops out of the way I'm
sure you guys are wondering what the
heck is up with the little dragon stuffy
that we've had sitting here his name
according to msi canada's facebook fans
is Emmis inferno because there's an eye
at the beginning it in front of hot
sorry and they're running a cool little
promotion with this laptop or if you buy
it in November you get one of these bad
boys a keyboard skin and the SteelSeries
flux headset with little MSI branding on
it and all that but if you are not
shopping for a notebook then you can
still actually get one of these bundles
they're giving them away to three
winners on Facebook and they're also
doing a grand prize bundle with this
polo shirt a mouse pad and a GK 601
mechanical gaming keyboard the full
