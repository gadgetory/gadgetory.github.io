for more details welcome to my unboxing
and overview it's not a first look
because not that I broke the seal
already this is the Razer edge gaming
tablet what makes a tablet a gaming
tablet well for one thing if a tablets
performance was measured by weight then
the Razer edge would definitely be the
highest performance tablet out there the
other thing is if a tablets performance
was measured by performance then the
Razer edge would be the highest
performance tablet out there so yes it
is a gaming tablet what comes inside is
pretty straightforward razors usual
attention to detail with the packaging
with their matte black whatnots and all
that the first thing we find is a power
brick so it's got a short AC cable right
here quite short thing when the about
one Linus arm lengths long ok so that
plugs into the wall wart which you'll
notice doesn't look much like a tablet
wall board this looks like a notebook
wall wart because this basically is a
notebook in a tablet form factor it's
got all the power you'd expect from a
notebook so it needs all the power you'd
expect to need to give a notebook now it
has a much longer thin cable so that's
the DC power cable that goes out to the
tablet itself and terminates in a
proprietary connector on a right angle I
would have liked to see some kind of a
connector that was non proprietary in
some way I mean I guess I can kind of
understand why Razer did this it gets it
sort of out of the way while you're
holding the device so next up inside
here we've got just basically some
documentation welcome to the cult of
razer and all that sort of good stuff
that they usually include with their
gear for gamers by gamers why do we make
these products because well no one else
did so we thought we'd do it there's are
some Razer stickers as well as you look
a little cleaning cloth for your product
that's all good stuff alright so that's
pretty much it that comes with the
tablet now this is the Razer edge pro
which is the $1500 version of the tablet
and this is the but wait there's more
moment because the $1500 version of the
tablet doesn't come with everything you
need necessary
there's a couple of other accessories
that razors been shipping out to the
press that really help you have the full
experience so number one is the edge
docking station so the docking station
is pretty straightforward you plug that
same proprietary power connector into it
you can plug headphones microphone so
dedicated headphone and microphone jacks
as opposed to the integrated one that's
on the tablet itself you've got an HDMI
port three USB ports so it also acts as
a USB hub the tablet itself only has one
USB 3 port and then finally the actual
dock itself yes right there so it's it's
just like that it's a little bit of an
angle so you could sit and use it
connected to the dock it's got some heft
to it so I would actually trust my $1500
tablet to not be dropped by it and it
has one of the best rubberized sticky
bottoms that I think I have ever
encountered if I put this down on the
table I couldn't move it pretty much no
matter how hard I tried so oh my
goodness it's like stuff look at this I
can't even lift it oh there goes
detached now so it's an excellent
rubberized grip I wish everything had
supple soft rubber like this on the
bottom of it it's outstanding so there
you go the dat the dock is intended for
people who are going to use the Razer
edge as something like a gaming console
where you leave the dock next to your TV
for example and then you plug in the
edge whenever you're going to use it
with a wireless controller say for
example now not everyone's going to use
it like that a lot of people are going
to go well if I wanted to play games on
my TV I could build a media PC or I
could use a console or I could do any
number of those other things that people
do to play games on their TVs so that's
where this one comes in this is the game
controller accessory so it's going to
welcome to the pelt of Razer piece of
soft foam inside and the game controller
itself so the game controller adds some
functionality that you don't have with
the tablet on its own for example it
adds a game controller which I'm sure
you didn't figure out based on the name
of the device so let's go through and
let's have a look at what buttons it
adds so you've got two Auxiliary I've
got auxiliary buttons here on the left
and here on the right handles you've got
a d-pad on the left with a bxy
buttons on the right so that's how you
could play your your legacy games all
right then you've got two analog sticks
one on the left one on the right nice
rubberized tops on them that feel like
there should be quite durable then on
the shoulders you've got three buttons
each so two top buttons l1 and l2 r1 and
r2 and then two triggers so left trigger
and right trigger you've also got an
extended battery included in this unit
that adds while in sort of a hardcore
gaming scenario probably about 45
minutes of extra battery life and while
not in a hardcore gaming scenario up to
a few hours of extra battery life and
then you've got an illuminated Razer
logo on the back you've got pass
throughs for all of the important
functionality on the top of the tablet
so your keyboard button your rotation
lock your power button your volume
rockers your headphone port and your USB
3 port ventilation ports here and you've
got nice little rubber pieces here that
are going to keep the tablet from
getting scratched up as you insert it
into the controller dock now it does add
and I'm just going to put this in you
can do it pretty quickly so you pop that
in pop this in here and then lock it in
from the bottom it does add a fair bit
of heft to the tablet in fact with the
whole setup configured I'm just going to
get box of the way oops
with the whole setup configured the
total weight in pounds alright is about
that pounds mm-hmm
three pounds 11 ounces and I can't
remember how many ounces there are in a
pound but that sounds to me like about 3
and 3/4 pounds with the whole thing set
up so it does get quite heavy and it's
not the kind of thing where you'd be
sitting and gaming with it like this
sort of like holding it up like this for
an extended period of time
so let's now that I've covered all the
accessories which I sort of meant to do
near the end let's talk about the razor
edge itself so it's over 2 pounds just
with the tablet alone it's thick so if I
pull out my HTC One I can do my
trademark size comparison here which
don't worry about getting too close to
because I'm going to do an overlay for
this and you can see that this is not a
thin tablet by any stretch of the
imagination
if you want a thin tablet you're going
to want to be buying yourself something
arm-based or something with an Apple
processor such as an iPad this is pretty
much a PC it has a core i7 processor
that's clocked at 1.9 gigahertz so this
is the pro model and up to three
gigahertz when using turbo boost which
means you've got great performance but
you compromise that thickness it's got
an aluminum backing which feels really
nice it feels really premium and it
should help to dissipate some of the
heat from the tablet itself particularly
when you're gaming this side acts as an
intake and this side acts as an exhaust
so what I found was that while holding
the device my right hand got
significantly warmer where my left hand
was actually cooled by the device which
created a bit of a weird effect but I
can understand why they did it this way
because it makes the cooling extremely
efficient they only have to have one
channel for the air moving through the
entire tablet see I wanted to call it a
notebook there because the back of it
really does look kind of like a notebook
and razor is going to have a keyboard
accessory that you can get in the future
as well so they've borrowed some styling
from their from their blade which might
my razor blade video actually got
blocked by YouTube because I had the
word switchblade in the description so I
wasn't able to put ads on that for a
long time but that's just a random vent
not really about anything ah the build
quality is outstanding it really does
feel like a premium tablet so you can
see here there's almost no flex to it
whatsoever no matter what I do to it
part of this is going to be a function
of the glass top and aluminum back and
part of it is going to be a function of
the fact that it's just the thicker but
remember guys thickness does not
necessarily make it well-built whereas
this one really does feel quite well
built the front is completely plain
pretty much exactly what you'd expect
from the tablet these days 10 inch
tablet wider than usual bezel which at
first I kind of went oh that's kind of
weird
but then I understood why it's got to be
a little bit thicker because of a couple
things it's a thicker tablet so the the
grip you have when holding it is going
to be maybe a little bit bigger and the
other thing is if you're gaming on the
device if you're meant to be sort of
holding it like this it's not
necessarily a bad thing to have a bit of
a wider bezel so I again I saw her I
understood why they did that other than
that in the front all you've gots a 2
megapixel camera and that you can use
for you know I don't know video calling
or whatever else and a dedicated Windows
button
on the sides of the device you find
nothing
so there's completely plain right side
completely plain left side on the bottom
you find two speaker girls which
actually worked surprisingly well
I love the front-facing speakers on the
HTC One and I think everything should be
front-facing however if we can't have
front-facing then I'll settle for bottom
facing because at least with bottom
facing you don't cover them up when you
hold the device by the side so many
devices do this same thing with back
facing a lot of the time you'll cover
them up when you're holding it bottom
facing I don't really see anyone using a
tablet like this so should be fine not
too worried about that then on the top
is where we find all the serious
business I oh oh a night okay so I
complained about the proprietary
connector I do understand why they have
it because it acts as a dock and an HDMI
and a USB hub and all that stuff I just
just don't necessarily like it that's
all that's all just throwing that out
there so we've got our power button our
keyboard button which is awesome
this was a lifesaver because the
keyboard button just is like okay if
you're using it as a gaming device how
often do you end up needing a keyboard
just to I don't know
just get out of a menu or navigate
something or whatever else because many
games for Windows are not optimized for
just a compute of ice so it was really
nice to have that dedicated keyboard
button you've got a rotation lock volume
rocker as well as a headphone microphone
jack and a single USB 3 port spec wise
like I said this is the pro so I
mentioned the core i7 processor it's got
a gig of ram a 256 gig SSD which means
you've got enough space to actually put
a fair number of games on it and it has
a geforce GT 640 le that's what makes
this tablet gaming grade as opposed to
just another tablet that's using the
onboard video on the processor built
into the Ivy Bridge prop CPU so okay
what does it 640 M really mean in terms
of a gaming experience I'm going to show
you guys how quickly it boots up there
you go you can you can thank the SSD for
that so what does that mean in terms of
what it looks like well that's kind of
funny my siblings were playing games on
this thing and apparently they left it
in a game which is handy for doing
product demos
there we go so let's reconnect that
controller and we got some dirt three
going on here
so what does that mean in terms of the
gaming experience it's legitimately
better it's way better than on board is
it a gtx titan no it's not a gtx titan
is it intended to be a gtx titan no I
mean this device actually doesn't cost
that much more than a Titan for the
whole thing okay it does cost more but
not that much more so what does it
actually do well it runs modern games
with the exception of super super
high-end games like Crysis 3 at
acceptable frame rates at the native
resolution so I've seen people complain
about the 1366 by 768 display on the
Razer edge and my response to this is
well what else were they supposed to do
it's not like they could put a Titan in
here and I would rather have a lower
resolution screen then deal with
dithering so if this had a 1080p screen
what you'd run into is you would have it
down scaling in order to run it
resolutions that the onboard GPU could
handle so you'd actually have to have
deci dithering I think in an
interpolation one way or another they're
bad things and you don't want to do
either those things pretty yeah
interpolation sorry my bad it's an IPS
display so while it wasn't the most
vibrant IPS display I've ever seen there
wasn't really any detectable motion blur
or ghosting as it's colloquially
referred to so it delivered a very
acceptable gaming experience so we've
got dirt3 going here and this highlights
sort of what I meant before when I said
the lack of a physical keyboard hampers
the gaming experience somewhat because
how do I alt enter I don't know how to
full screen a program without alt enter
I rely on my keyboard a lot in a Windows
environment and it's not the edges fault
it's just the way windows works they
expect you to control C control V so now
that the game isn't in full screen if
the game itself doesn't have an option
to go to full screen then you're just
kind of boned because you got control
you got I don't know where's like can
you shift where shift tab because shift
goes away when you go into the number
pad here so how do you get rid of
something like a steam overlay it can be
a little bit frustrating but once you
get past the the issues that are present
so we're going to
continue our race here lips and going
backwards there we go the gaming
experience is actually really cool so I
hope you can get in close enough that
you can see this I did turn the screen
resolution up so this is dirt 3 which
may not be the most hardcore title by
any stretch of the imagination but it is
a totally acceptable gaming experience
on a modern title that looks absolutely
fantastic which isn't going to prevent
someone like me from crashing the car
necessarily so I'm going to go ahead and
pause that and we'll move into what's
what's it what's it what's it like
overall using this thing so I was
playing around with it for a couple days
I again so more difficulty with things
like an SNES emulator that runs in like
DOS mode so it was difficult to navigate
through it with touchscreen things like
that but if you use steam big picture
which I found to be not that bad of an
experience I wish that steam big picture
was a little bit more touch optimized
but we know how gabe newell feels about
windows 8 and all that noise I wish
you'd kind of get over that and and help
us with the gaming experience as opposed
to sit and be upset about it but with
big picture was a little bit better did
make navigation a little bit easier
there are ways to add here we go so I'll
just click this button there are ways to
add your Steam games as tiles so there's
a couple of different apps that do that
in the Windows 8 Store and it was pretty
it was pretty darn cool the other things
to look out for is some USB devices
won't work with the game controller on
because of the depth of the connector
however I only had one in the house that
had that issue but check this out even
though it adds some some bulk to the key
off to the keyboard to the headphone
microphone jack I was able to plug in
right angle headphones without the the
mic not working or the headphones not
working or whatever else like that so
what does all this mean I guess graphics
you can actually play PC games on in a
tablet power that is really more
equivalent to something like a low-end
to mid-range gaming notebook in a form
factor that is phenomenally impressive
looks beautiful is different from
anything else that's out there but at a
price where really you got to pay to
play it's not cheap if you want this
unique device that is able to game in a
tablet like form factor if you're
willing to accept the hour and change of
battery life that comes with it when
it's actually running games and the sort
of you know three to three-and-a-half
hours that you're going to get out of it
when you're not running games it is a
completely unique experience that is
unlike anything else thank you for
