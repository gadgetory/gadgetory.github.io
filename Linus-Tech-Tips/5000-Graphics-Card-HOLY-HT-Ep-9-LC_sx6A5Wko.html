earth did Linus tech tips get ahold of a
Quadro em 6000 a $5,000 video card and
the answer to that is that I'm not going
to tell you all top secret no but what I
will tell you is but can it run crisis
intel skull Canyon Nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the
link in the video description but before
I answer the age-old question let's see
if we can't figure out exactly what
makes a $5,000 graphics card so freakin
special tastic I mean it's got a GM 200
Maxwell architecture GPU on it so you
can't see it it's on the other side but
you go ahead and try good for you that's
like your effort over there it's got
3072 cuda cores it's clocked at
somewhere around 1 gigahertz a little
lower on the base a little higher on the
boost it's got whoo look at this 4
DisplayPort outputs so you can have 4 4k
displays running off it at the same time
also there's lonely old DVI up there
that can also run VGA if you're into
that sort of thing although I don't
think too many people running $5,000
graphics cards can't afford a monitor
that was made in the last 10 years in
terms of ok you got SLI and sync
connectors as well as a stereo connector
if you work in stereo 3d content so
that's pretty cool
and this is really exciting boom the
power connector is a single 8 pin on the
back of the card over there yes on the
back of the card my friends which I
guess is important if you're mounting it
in a rack mount case where there isn't
always clearance for power connectors
that come out the side like is popular
on desktop models the more you know but
hold on a second Linus all that sounds
awfully similar to the Titan X a
graphics card that costs $4,000 less I
mean ok there's an HDMI port instead of
DisplayPort and like and it's got an
extra power connector on a different
spot but this one has like LEDs and what
makes this better well we missed one
small detail it has 24 gigs of DDR 5
memory and not only that but that memory
is capable of running an ECC mode for
like super you know less chance of
something going bad
let's put it on a bitch angels singing
so maybe we get like lots of amazing
options inside Nvidia control panel
deciding how to use our GPU know we can
view system topology we can set up
mosaic which is like surround and we can
we have a dedicated tab for changing the
ECC state hard to make this exciting
just won a game I'm methodically getting
very high right now whatever I didn't
change anything screw off let's do the
crisis benchmark so the benchmarks over
prepare to be amazed and awed and I'm
talking like oh not like Oh in Crysis 3
the Quadro and 6000 scores 104 yes
even good so we're back at it with the
tight necks and I have to confess this
feels like a very similar experience
okay moment of truth time 105.5 FPS well
okay then
but come on Linus what were you
expecting quadrille cards aren't made
for gaming well truthfully that's
exactly what I was expecting because
while it is true that quadrille cards
are not designed for gaming I mean the
gaming performance of them is right on
the spec sheet the GPU the clock speed
it runs at I don't know where this whole
myth comes from that quadrille cards are
meant for specific workloads in are not
meant game and like to know a GPU is a
GPU it just means that quadrille cards
are also need for other things so let's
have a look at some rendering benchmarks
or maybe some you know high-end video
production benchmarks and see if we can
better justify its high price tag okay
so this is a octane demo a little
outside my comfort zone in terms of
products that I hope control-z okay all
good render target there we go so we're
using let's see 1.6 gigs of memory and
we are processing at 7.2 to 7.3 million
pixels per second those pixels oh what
they are okay well I'm not going to sit
here and watch this go for half an hour
so let's try something else before we
put the tight necks back on DaVinci
Resolve let's watch some freaking sharks
alright we're getting about 12 frames
per second with like denoising on and
such again presumably that is very good
but I don't know that is very similar
that is faster so far that is
the same but maybe DaVinci Resolve then
I want to see big FPS oh now come on
that doesn't even make sense no that
can't be right wow that's shark just
like a two fish
okay so DaVinci Resolve with our 6k
footage on a 4k timeline performed much
better on the tight necks but of course
you could afford much more than one
tight necks for the price of an M 6000
let's see if the story changes with more
tight Nexus 8 pin to 6 pin to dual molex
okay I have used adapters wait what
why is this not lighting up is it
working is like the light just unplug
did someone screw up and not plug in the
light on this wait no this doesn't make
sense because this was my first one how
could that not be working
whatever the indicator LEDs might seem
to think all three video cards are
showing up and we are not running an SLI
because a I don't have a 3-way SLI
bridge handy and B because that's really
not the point of what we're doing we are
not looking at gaming performance we are
seeing how the Titan X compares to the
Quadro in more quadrant like
applications three Titan X's is much
faster
wow that's scaling though look at that
it's estimating that it's only going to
take about eleven minutes to finish this
scene of course I still don't have
eleven minutes because when show started
28 minutes ago let's fire up resolve and
see how that does you've got to be
kidding me
I think that would have worked I think
we had all three GPUs engaged but we
just triggered over current protection I
mean the truth of the matter is that
none of this really affects the
conclusion anyway
why does the Quadro M 6000 cost $5,000
in the olden days I would have told you
that it's for its F P 64 double
precision compute performance because
prior to the M series that would have
actually been true it performed more
like a Tesla in that regard but these
days it actually performs just like a
g-force there too with 1/32 of the
performance of what you can expect in FP
32 computations so if you were say for
example doing financial analysis or some
kind of physical modeling you wouldn't
choose one of these either no my friends
the Quadro m 6000 the reason that Nvidia
and P and y both refused to send one to
me even though I explained that I was
going to explain all this that they're
not for general consumers they're not
for gaming in fact they're not even for
this the purpose of these is simple if
you need to render scenes that require
more than the amount of memory that
you'll find on a consumer-grade graphics
card you will need to buy one of these
so let's say for example your Pixar or
you're working on the Angry Birds movie
or whatever the case may be if you are
anyone else then you would be better
served by a bunch of these and like a
lifetime supply of M&amp;amp;Ms and maybe throw
in a power supply that doesn't trip the
OCP when you try to actually engage all
of them so that's pretty much it then
thanks for watching this episode of holy

online is tech tips if you guys dislike
this video hit the dislike button but if
you liked it hit the like button get
subscribed maybe even consider checking
out where to buy one of these or maybe a
more sensible graphics card we'll have a
link in the video description while
you're down there you can also check out
our merch store where we have cool
shirts like this one as well as our
community forum where you can ask all of
your technology related questions and
get answers better answers then no you
can't game on a Quadro the true answer
is yes you can no you probably shouldn't
because you just spent $5,000 for the
gaming performance of it and that's
ignoring the 980ti which performs
exactly the same as the tight necks for
$1000 graphics card thanks again for
watching
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
