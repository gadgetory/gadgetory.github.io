brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries hey guys we're here at
the Indy mega booth checking out as tez
I had to check this game out not only
because the art style looks amazing but
there's blood everywhere and that's just
awesome so what can you tell me about
this game so asses is it's actually two
games it's a beat them up and also a
strategy game so the idea is that you
can go back and forth between the two
and have some fun real-time beat-'em-up
segments and then kind of make some
decisions and think a little bit the
reason we did that is because we're
tired of the standard beat-'em-up
formula and just want to see something
new so for sure what can you tell me
more about the the building motor that
the the nation controlling mode so
you're basically going to be looking at
a giant map of the Aztec empire shortly
before the Spanish show up and the idea
is that you're going to be pushing on
the boundaries of the Empire trying to
expand it but also managing chaos so
when it happens you're going to enter
one of the many city environments and
and knock some heads around so you know
it's kind of the way the Aztecs did
things yeah so basically if someone
messes with your turf you go knock them
out but sounds pretty cool yeah exactly
now one thing is when you go to know if
these guys out you can control different
characters can you tell me more about
that you're actually controlling a like
special forces unit almost so this is
just like a very very powerful get in
there make a mess send the message get
out but when it's all said and done
you'll be able to look however you want
you'll be able to use one of four
different weapons we want it to be very
expressive and feel like it's it's you
know you're making decisions and it's a
reflection of you but but it is just say
a nondescript Special Forces warrior so
that's cool that's cool I notice again
that you said making a mess as I
mentioned earlier there's blood
everywhere what can you tell me about
the blood mechanic so the reason there's
a blood mechanics was the Aztecs were
very very big on blood it was actually
part of their religious belief system
they believed that the Sun was moving
through the sky on an engine of blood
which is why they were so crazy about
sacrifice like those aren't legends they
actually does that a lot so we figured
it would really pipe into what was cool
about the Aztecs to have the blood to
actually be a part of the game so the
way it works is that in the game you're
spilling blood constantly because of the
fighting you can absorb it and
and based on different factors it will
do different things for you always
advantageous but it's just a way to to
make something that's always there
actually be useful yeah right and that
ties into the combo points an amount of
hits you can get in what way it depends
sometimes it will give you health back
sometimes it'll extend your combo meter
we're thinking at this point it's not
finalized yet but we're thinking at this
point you want to give you a choice what
do you want the blood to do so that's
great and like with the combo stuff Wow
sorry I just had to point out that was
an insane amount of blood that just flew
through the scree certain like every
once in a while you hear an echo sound
and the guy jumps up is that just the
jumper is that something else going on
and we're trying to give every single
enemy attack a distinct tell that means
a very specific visual in a very
specific piece of audio so when you're
hearing that Eagle scream that basically
means that is the specific attack that's
about to happen so what kind of gives
you mentally prepared for what's
happening in the next second right and
the whole mental preparedness this is
not a game that's based around button
mashing if you notice when he just
whiffed right there a whiff is when you
miss a person so you kind of grow up
your combo you're trying to get all
those extra points you with you lose
your combo so it's more about strategy
listening to the key points like you
were just talking about and making sure
that you land all those hits because
that is how you can get more blood and
more points one other thing that I had
to touch on is the art style because the
second you walk past this booth you
notice it's very unique what can you
tell me about that so the reason we have
an art style that looks like this is
because a I thought it would be a cool
challenge I've never really done
anything like this before and I'm the
only artist on the project okay so the
other reason something like this makes a
lot of sense is because if we had a very
very complex art style would be
difficult to create a lot of assets so
we had to do something that would make
us stand out and that also made sensor
from a production point of view and
that's kind of why we ended up here the
only other reason is that it sort of
makes sense and kind of looks as techy
at the end of the day so it's just it's
it's what ended up making the most sense
for us yeah it looks fantastic and
you're definitely right it does look as
sucky but there must have been some
amount of challenges and running this as
well because making things pop out must
have been interesting was that difficult
oh yeah I mean it took
time to get it to the point to where it
was both interesting and not difficult
to look at so I mean people compare it
to mad world a law which I totally
understand but the thing about mad world
is that there's no gray it's actually
very very difficult on a lot of people's
eyes so I was trying to get as far away
from something like that as possible
because obviously don't want to create
any physical pain in anyone playing my
game but it did take a while to get it
to the sweet spot so it's a really good
point about the gray because when you
look at this game it's not it's sharp
contrast but it's not sharp because it's
still comfortable and smooth to look at
it's really cool that you were able to
capture that yeah for sure I mean it the
trick is really that the characters and
the effects are black the foreground is
like a dark gray and then it just slowly
creates us fake sense of depth by just
lightening the gray so it is it is
ultimately so very simple but it's
helping create the distinction of the
layers for the eyeballs so yeah that's
really cool and one thing that they also
added in is that you can play this on
oculus rift luckily in unity it's not
really that hard to add riff support so
they added that and honestly if I was to
play this game I'd love to pick up an
oculus rift so I'm super happy that you
guys implemented that they've slightly
changed the angle so that it makes a lot
more sense what can you tell me about
that so the only thing that we really
did is that we brought the camera a
little bit lower and a little bit closer
into the characters so what that means
is that you've got to actually look to
the left and the right to see what's
happening around you and it's just very
compelling something about it made it
much more engaging it made it much more
interesting but since you have to look
around it also makes the environment
much more alive and so that was the only
change we made in five minutes or like
let's try this an editor being awesome
so we're sticking with it but yeah i
mean like i said its unity it's an easy
implementation so you'll be able to play
on the rift when the game is out yeah
that's great to hear a recurring theme I
find with this game is that you guys
made something that seems simple I
changed that seem simple that made all
the difference and mate will make in my
opinion will make this game which is
really great to hear thank you for
running us through the boot yeah thank
