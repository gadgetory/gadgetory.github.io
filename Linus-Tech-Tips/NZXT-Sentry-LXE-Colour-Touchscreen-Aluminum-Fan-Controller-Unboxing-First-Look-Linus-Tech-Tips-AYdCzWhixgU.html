speed controller from NZXT this is the
sentry LXE it's a high performance
touchscreen fan controller supports up
to 8 watts per channel I mean an 8 watt
fan is a pretty beefy fan so this is
gonna support most of the fans on the
market without any difficulty
it displays our PMS for 5 fans which
stands to reason because it is a 5 fan
control fan speed controller you can
also get 5 temperature displays you can
get a touch screen monitor which you can
press to control everything anyway
alright
I think that's pretty much oh that's
interesting it says 10 watts per channel
on the back so I wonder which of those
is correct maybe if someone someone
knows which is correct they can they can
tell us interesting
so there's a desktop external
temperature meter through a PCI card
interface touch interface intuitive rpm
control auto emmanuel mode operation hey
it displays the date time and day of the
week it has a brushed aluminum frame and
a screen on/off switch it also features
an alarm system which it has in common
with most fan speed controllers because
the whole point of a fan speed
controller besides controlling the speed
of your fans is to alert you if anything
goes wrong and it loses control so the
alarm will tell you if fans go below a
certain rpm or worse yet if they stop
altogether and in theory
that'll alert you alarm you yeah it
should alarm you but in theory that'll
let you know that the fan has failed and
you need to do something about it quick
test and hurry before your stuff
overheats and dies so here's the user
manual which is really one panel no two
panels ok well there this is the English
one right here so it shows you you
connect the little PCI card here you
connect the three pin fan connectors to
the board and the fans you want to
control and detect you plug a little
this is interesting people here well why
don't we pull this out and have a closer
look okay well hold on let's see what
else we have here so here's the touch
screen interface usage so they show you
the places to touch in order to select
fan channels hold this button to turn
off the screen oh you can turn off the
screen that's cool because if you're
sleeping or whatever
it's pretty handy touch the switch to go
between auto and manual modes modify the
time having a manual like God is really
useful because I remember I was trying
to use one of the touchscreen fan
controllers a while back it wasn't an
NZXT one I don't remember which one it
was exactly but it was just a nightmare
to try and figure out how to do anything
on it and I mean I'm not exactly you
know this isn't my first computer
component I I can usually figure things
out fairly easily but this one was just
ridiculous I couldn't figure out how to
do anything with it every time I tried
to adjust anything I ended up like
triggering the alarm or something stupid
like that it was not a very good
experience but hopefully this one would
be better so you got a couple of
different mounting options for this guy
I think maybe you don't I'll open it up
and find out oh no you don't know this
is interesting okay well what I was
expecting was for this to be a dual five
and a quarter inch Bay fans beach
controller but what it actually is
and I guess I should have known this
somehow yeah you can see the stand right
there on the box I mean it should be
pretty obvious but this actually sits on
your dentist's can it looks quite nice
you've got the brushed aluminum finish
that they were talking about before
you've got kind of a chromed accent
around the screen itself and then you've
got the touch screen right here and this
is I mean this is thick too this is just
gorgeous metal because what you
typically see unlike a cheap component
that's gonna sort of sit on your desk
like this is you'd see aluminum maybe
half the thickness of this usually steel
never mind aluminum but it would be just
like thin thin stuff wouldn't look very
nice but this is actually got like a
it's got a plastic back on it but I
don't think that really matters because
they've just got a gorgeous piece of
aluminum on the front here these bottom
pieces I'm not sure if they're stickers
or not no it looks like they're just
rubber so they're non-slip rubber on the
bottom here to make sure that it doesn't
slip okay
if you were to put it down on say for
example a park bench you wouldn't have
to worry about it moving around too much
see I can put a little bit of force on
it and it won't move too badly all right
so let's have a look at the accessories
that are included with the LXE first of
all we have this wow that's a long cable
look at this I think it's longer than I
am Paul which isn't really saying much
but I guess it's gonna be yeah Wow it's
gotta be like six and a half feet tall
okay interesting I guess we'll find out
what that does it evolved it and then
what other cables do we have so we have
our PCI control card that's pretty cool
all right so here's all of our
temperature sensors five temperature
sensors coming out of these temp 1 temp
2/10 3/10 4 and temp 5 headers here and
then here we have what's this this is
probably power I guess
let's find out we'll take this twist tie
off and this thing actually looks pretty
cool I haven't seen something like this
before it's quite unique fan speed
controllers are one of those things that
it's really hard to find a good one like
I actually spent Wow after International
shipping I had to buy it from like
Germany or something ridiculous like
that but I actually spent about a
hundred and fifty dollars on my fan
speed controller just to get something
that worked the way I wanted it to so
anyway here we have the five fans that
we can control and then there are all of
the cables for them so you can run these
to any part of your case quite easily
you can see these aren't quite as long
as that other cable we were looking at
but they are pretty long assuming you
mount it somewhere near the top of your
PCI slots and then the last one here is
yeah that's power so you've got a 4-pin
molex power connector here and then
there's a battery spot and they include
a battery for you so I'm guessing you
plugged that battery in and it keeps all
of your settings stored when the system
is powered off and it does not have any
power profiles and speeds and your time
and all that it's going to be stored
without having to worry about it
we have a couple of temperature sensor
I'm sure why we have additional ones
because there aren't anymore ports but
yeah it looks like we have two more
attempts sensors how interesting
okay I'm not quite certain that I can
figure out why they're here but they're
here so you have two more attempts
sensors maybe it's just if you want to
run them somewhere else in your case
because the other ones are all kind of
grouped together maybe if you don't want
to use two of them okay and I figured
out what this cables for so this cable
goes from the back of the PC I mounted
card here so it keeps would only go
within one way so you can see it goes in
that way so goes from there to wherever
you want so it goes out of the back of
your computer assuming your computer is
positioned somewhere sort of around here
and then it plugs into the back of the
touchscreen display and then you put
that wherever you want
that's actually really classy looking
look at that anyway I like it thank you
