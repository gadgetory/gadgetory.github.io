unboxing here to do I'm unboxing the MTR
320 Q P stack so there's actually two
different MCR 320 q PS and i'll get into
what that is in just a moment it comes
in a plain brown box and yes this is yet
another water-cooling i don actually
working on on a new water-cooling build
right now so this is all stuff that i've
actually bought for our system that i'm
building in the corsair obsidian 800
deep so for starters let's get into what
comes in the accessory package first of
all we have a wide variety of rubber
o-rings looks like it comes with six we
have these are great for little tiny
stubby fittings so these are half-inch
are they all half-inch yes they are all
half-inch fittings so how this is
designed to work is if you have two of
these stack radiators or a stack and a
non stack you would actually do two just
so these o-rings are for all the
fittings that you would need to stack
two radiators together with two fans
sandwiched in between you use the little
stubby fittings in here and the water
actually flows in parallel between the
two rads and you use two of these worm
drive clamps in order to make sure that
the tubing doesn't slip off in between
not that I would worry too much about
that but it also prevents leaks if you
use a worm drive clamp okay so we have a
stackable series radiators informational
guide now I'm probably gonna throw this
unboxing up on the product pages for
both of the two different rads however
where this is obviously the stackable
one so there are suppose some specific
instructions including how to attach one
stackable and one normal rag in order to
get the benefit of additional cooling
capacity there's also a quick guide here
on how to use the little fasteners for
attaching fins to the radiator and but
it okay and then there's your standard
MCR xx
so whichever NCR series round you are
using installation guide so that shows
you how to use a screw to attach the fan
to the radiator and caution do not poke
the screws too far and pierce the
radiator fins is probably what that is
cautioning you not to do yes it is okay
so in this little cardboard
thingamajiggy it's protected by
cardboard so that these screws won't
bounce around and puncture the radiator
in transit
we've actually got 12 long screws and
four short screws so the 12 long screws
would be used to attach three fans to
each mounting point on the rad and then
the four short screws will be used to
attach this entire radiator and fan
assembly up into the top of the 800 d
case which I will likely show at some
point in the future I'll make an
annotation here if I ever get around to
it so here we have a nice sort of paper
e-cloth e shroud over a tissue paper
shroud over the radiator itself so Swift
xmc r-series rads are a quiet radiator
so what that means is that there's a low
fpi or fins per inch count so that means
that it is optimized to work best with
quiet fans versus any a competing
radiator which might have more densely
packed fins which will perform better if
you have high CFM fans but not nearly as
well if you have low flow fans so I'm
going to be using relatively low airflow
fans and the eight limbs so this is
definitely the optimal setup for me you
can see we've got our threaded mounting
points sorry excuse me twelve six aside
okay
and then we have the same thing on the
other side of the rad now what you may
or may not have noticed when I flip that
over is that there are actually mounting
spots for the barbs on both sides of the
stackable radiator so that's what I was
talking about before I was saying you
can actually use either two stackables
or one stackable and one non stackable
in order to set up two radiators next to
each other with just fittings in between
a normal radiator would only have
fittings on one side so thank you for
checking out my video blog and unboxing
on this
Tech MCR 3:20 quiet power stackable or
non stackable depending which product
page you're looking at radiator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
