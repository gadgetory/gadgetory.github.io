fun we actually came in on the weekend
and cleaned out the server room and one
of the things that I noticed was that
these shelves which are supposed to be
the shelves that hold the pending
projects for our writer and stuff Wow
indelible marker these shelves which I
wish that would come off easier to which
are supposed to hold the projects for
our writing staff basically haven't even
been looked at in months and so I was
watching other youtube videos I wasn't
really watching them I was more
scrolling through titles and thumbnails
and I saw someone's video something
about extreme declutter and you know
what I was inspired we were gonna do
extreme tech declutter and James is
gonna be my love ass
it's short for lovely assistant story
blocks video blocks offers you studio
quality stock video clips for a fraction
of the cost
check it out today at the link in the
video description
so when you say declutter you mean I
mean everything that we are never
actually gonna make a video about needs
to come off these damn shelves
thermaltake pumps Jake this looks more
like a monitor bracket to me wow this is
oh this is from RGB water cooling this
is like why is it on whose shelf it's on
James's shelf over there so here's the
plan then we're just gonna take this
James bin and we're gonna make it into a
things James will have to deal with
off-camera bin what is this oh you're
gonna love this an Atari hat not just an
Atari hat a hat with speakers in it hey
that's creepy yeah what what's the point
though is it a webcam I think it's like
a selfie camera ya know it's like kinda
hard to what is the rhythm this is the
exact same situation I was like no
thanks not at this time and they were
like guys try it and so that is like a
personal biometrics
recording device I don't even know what
it measures I tried to look up it's all
it doesn't have a pot it's all acronyms
no this is an engineering sample oh dude
we ended up with serial number one and
we never did anything with it okay we
should make an eBay pile a legal keypad
for lawyers on the move meet the legal
pack you can press half the key down
without actually activating the switch
oh I'm not impressed so this one's much
city too but you can see it's a normal
accordi but on the numpad side it all
these weird little legally as symbols so
you can more easily write contracts
it's a lawyer keyboard some lawyer
keyboard for lawyers who don't feel like
being able to hit their Enter key with
their pinkie yeah it's it's American
legalese with a nice European friggin
layout brilliant oh my god is this a
wireless music light bulb you know what
we should do we should get the audience
through their up votes in the comments
to pick four items for the next handy
tech under 100 so this will be a
candidate what are these is this an
entire pile of keyboards yeah
and it's a split keyboard oh so there's
like a telephone while a choir kind of
cable that connects them and they
connect with these magnets those are the
contact points and then these are steel
rails so it's a pretty sturdy connection
yeah once it's on there that's not bad
and where we just were we gonna review
it and then just didn't get around to it
exactly it's a nice keyboard it's got
there's different switch types you can
order most of them are kales but you can
get cherry
I think greens and whites or something
clear
interesting the yeah that's one of the
coolest things is when it split apart
you can get these other modules that you
plug onto here they give you like give
you like thumb controls touchpad track
point trackball so those are all for the
right side yeah and then on this side
you can get one that's like got just a
cluster of keys maybe some table do a
few hundred twenty-five dollars and the
modules are 60 bucks did they just send
us all the tilting stuff but none of the
modules those modules are so cool yeah
ultimate hacking keyboard if you're
watching and you want to send us even
more expensive stuff that we might never
do anything then that's on my wish list
what is the key Z and how old is this I
think it's supposed to just look old
it's these things are awesome actually
so if you have a fob for your apartment
you can program it onto here and it can
learn up to four different low frequency
RF IDs like it's 125 Hertz things so
let's say you're at Airbnb slumlord and
you have five or four different
apartments you can put them all on one
flop how much is this like 40 bucks 44
or 45 bucks okay so we can throw this in
the handy tech under 100 candidates the
Kesey oh god the system is broken
no because this is to be dealt with this
we're naughty bang this bracket gonna be
oh that was probably gonna be the handy
tech bin okay so this is the bin to
reconcile later boom all you failed
you're supposed to write that and then
look up in the camera so the editor
could put sunglasses on table reenact it
deal with it so this is a web cam cover
for privacy the privacy cover it slides
and they were nice enough to make - tech
tips granted ones so here's a shout-out
steagle so your shelf was actually
pretty clean that was the easiest one
yeah I'm not dealing with this guy's
stuff oh this anything no he gets his
own bin they get their own reconciled
you volunteered to help oh my god that
is for a build that we've been planning
to do for over a year but well it has a
rise in five sixteen hundred exited the
build literally got outdated in the time
that we were thinking about actually
doing it yeah like I said over here
pretty sure it was Halloween last year
that we started looking at this 8 Meg's
of video
good thing that's on the shelf taking up
valuable self real estate okay I
actually know the story behind this so
this is a motherboard for the the
bare-bones Super Micro server that we
used for 10 gamers or eight gamers
depending how you count it one CPU oh my
god so half of your shelf is stuff from
Brian's basement we need to do a tech
hoarders episode on Brian's basement
remember the guy from the lake a local
electric car charger video hello is this
an actual Commodore 64 yes does this
work
actually this would be a cool sleeper
Stefan Apple - you get
one shelf for das gaming PC okay
anything that doesn't fit on the one
shelf goes back to Brian or free geek or
whatever so you heard it here first guys
we're doing a DOS gaming PC well it's
not anymore oh this is the cheapest
monitor on Amazon right oh my god we
should do this video yeah oh yeah no we
have a look at your shelf oh let's why
don't we start with this so that's the
singularity's I know what it is
I'm just for the viewers that might not
know be careful with that it's it's one
of a kind no I think he's made quite a
few at this point well yeah but this is
the first prototype so is this the way
we should be treating it then oh my god
you're getting a call
hold on hold on hello this is James's
answering service Arie I'm driving sorry
about that I gotta go bye there are
still SSDs in here yep
what the hell are these the 850 pro 1
terabytes these are labeled that's what
these are isn't it probably these are
labeled missing in the system Oh what
the hell man all these are this has been
here for like six months
this is just found yeah you know how
much these were worth when it was lost
do you know how much they're worth now
about the same no Alex this is where all
the Noctua industrial PPC fans are backs
all right what's this is this just the
box for this blatant thumbs-up retweet
if you want these what is this that's
from the rave PC but it stills a fully
functional laser light show no yeah we
couldn't find it
reservoir in peg yeah that's gonna be
super your problem to figure out where
the packaging is for it here we go
nailed it all right smart guy then
where's the package for this one
yeah more harder question yeah you think
also remember how I was running around
the office looking for one of those
molex to AC power adapters that are $40
each that we ordered more of to replace
them today well here's one key listen
there's a bin over there this whole
thing is it yeah that whole thing is one
adapt I'm gonna cable tie it thank you
go through stuff oh my god this is like
almost as bad as Anthony's this this is
the ITX form factor of PC from like a
decade ago which you can be considering
popping into your system after a turn I
was yeah you know I was yes you said
it's not completely stupid okay with
Windows XP okay missing something is not
completely stupid it's not the same is
me considering putting it in my car so
basically it's a computer that goes in
your dad mini Dean yeah gently and what
even that this is gift-wrapped lighting
because the stock guitar tubers like the
bright so custom like this yeah dog is
that much can read lines maybe here dog
come okay Steve so this board needs to
go back to whichever kind viewer sent it
to esta yeah gentle this is my price
graphics card collection why is it yeah
because I never took it home after doors
display the LTX
that was six months ago I know I am a
well aware it's a graphics card with
ethernet jacks all over the back of it
yeah why do you still have all these
old-ass gaming machines why are they all
here all of them are here answer is 42
do you have any gaming pcs at home left
yes they're not as old but quite as
obsolete show me the hand strength oh my
god it still has the peel on it this is
vintage in here man can't peel that
they're all on oh this this was the
board to have when I was getting into
being a PC nerd so this is the old WD
Velociraptor this was the pinnacle of
hard drive performance back in those
days back when hard drive performance
was not an oxymoron oh my god 2006 pipe
dream Products Inc you know what I'm
gonna do it you're doing would you say
that only in my dreams balls that go in
the mouth oh it doesn't taste very
Jake's is actually not as bad as I
thought it was gonna be my expectation
for him was very low it's because he
takes his junk and puts on other
people's shelves like that part straight
from the beginning rush huh huh gotta
wait for the camera actually it's like
he's actually this annoying all the time
this is copper tubing why does it say
RGB build yeah it says this crap do you
build there you actually did a good job
of putting away the cooler for your card
sort of mostly what that's an excellent
job I blame Matt James you blame James
means your rebuttal he was too lazy to
put it up in 101 so he dumped it in my
hands and then I put it on my shelf in
the meantime you didn't even tell me
what this was for
I literally you know I asked you and
then I was like oh wait I don't need it
in there like oh well too bad you got it
and then you walked away you give me a
hangout that's what happened you still
have that wall mounting oh here's the
problem one that only arrived today
yeah well I'm where's the banner well
you know what I'll do a favor I'll put
this back on the shelf for you yeah do
me a favor yeah yeah yeah do yourself a
favor well that I don't this worse that
was entirely your fault okay so this is
basically just a bin of garbage inside
another bin of garbage bin
which brings us finally to the cleanest
and most organized of all the shelves
all right Linus how do you explain this
someone's screwing me over here no oh oh
why'd you step away Oh what are you
wearing socks and sandals that work so
basically this is completely like
working it's still dripping and like
ready to go it's been upgraded to a gtx
1070 that hasn't actually been submerged
yet because the other one likes parked
in the middle of the video that we're
making about it the motherboards been
replaced as well I think yeah it's the
original power supply so the issue we
had was that the case for it you can
drop it right on my toes I'm wearing
real shoes oh yeah those are gonna
protect your toes so much no no the
audience believes me it is leaking oh
okay yeah that's why that bag was there
thank you don't get your socks wet okay
so here I'm gonna put this oh yeah it's
yeah okay okay
so the problem was that the outer
acrylic aquarium for it was leaking we
actually solved that problem so here's
the original castle and everything that
was inside it this paint held up
surprisingly well
by the way and this is actually a new
aquarium that Puget systems gave us out
of their reception room because their
mineral oil PC finally died and so they
they dropped this off for us I think is
this the one they dropped off for us
Jake yeah so this one is new so it's
just a matter of like putting it back
together and I've had on my shelf
because I thought maybe it's a video but
like it seems like a short video
literally just taking that putting it in
there yeah we could stream it let us
know in the comments you want to see
mineral oil resurrected live stream
that's pretty sweet
okay yeah so in that case yes this is an
active project you'll say anything to
keep this stuff on the shelf
well I just I don't want to get rid of
it it's got a lot of sentimental value
to me I'm out - what when did that I
thought we have a new record here before
any of you worked here if you guys
worked here before you probably have
that older stuff - all right so that's
the benefit of if you like something a
lot he says no everyone else who works
under you that is to take this stuff and
pack it up literally the definition of
an ongoing project we're gonna make a
video about it you decide who makes the
bigger livestream it on Friday
one-of-a-kind this is a prototype of an
AI oh okay so this is a prototype of an
AI Oh cooler that doesn't require a pump
oh yes yeah so I was thinking do you
want to see a video about it it doesn't
really like work properly it's just a
prototype it's like a proof of concept
it doesn't perform well but you guys
want to see a video like it does work
right no fine go ahead you try you can't
team up on me like that that's it I'm
done oh yeah what about all this stuff
