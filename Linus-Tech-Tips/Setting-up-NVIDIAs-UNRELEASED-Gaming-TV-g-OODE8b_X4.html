lounge slash employee happiness Center
we got this place pretty much ready to
watch movies 77 inch TV from Samsung 950
series super high-end sound bar from
Samsung with surround we've got the
couches in now these are freaking
awesome the only problem is that what
are the odds that you guys are gonna
hang around at the end of the day and
watch a movie together yeah not good
so today because we are constantly
tinkering with things it's like a
compulsion we are getting this place
gaming ready and when I say gaming I
don't mean like some PC master-race
oh no Xbox for life it's fast and it's
it's easier whatever no no everything
okay
PlayStation 4 pro Xbox 1 X Nintendo
switch PC obviously and we are changing
out the TV we're actually going down in
size from 77 to 65 inches but this right
here is one of the first ones to go
outside of Asus headquarters this is a
VF GD a big King gaming display excuse
me I mean big format gaming display
with glassware you can instantly see
your current and past Network activity
detect malware and block badly behaving
apps on your PC or Android device use
offer code lion√≠s to get 25% off
glassware at the link below yeah your
your energy is terrible first thing
we're gonna do there cross that off
you're gonna deal with the receiver
later so actually dbrand hooked us right
up with a whole bunch of this console
gaming stuff because let's face it we're
we gonna spend our money on consoles
okay there's a there's a touch of PCM
our mentality around here we weren't
going to do that so you do game consoles
and games and I will do
grown men things and we will get the TV
unpacked and mounted to the wall hope
you're not expecting a lot from me I
only signed up for exactly what's
happening right now yeah let's go James
come on come on oh I just heard the tape
coming off the walls think it's a little
frozen mount or what kind of should be
fine maybe just over there against the
wall or it could be balanced on top of
these boxes what put that soft ass
blanket down let me just put on the
floor there we go just yeah yeah just no
yeah no yeah yeah no no yeah so what's
so exciting about this thing for us is
the fact that BFG DS are able to not
only run at 4k but they can do it at a
hundred and twenty Hertz with g-sync
on a supported graphics card and they
have extremely low input lag so if we
were playing like you know Super Mario
World for example is a game that is just
almost impossible for me as a kid who
grew up playing it on a CRT to play on a
modern TV theoretically this should be
able to handle that just fine because
it'll have nearly imperceptible input
lag
super excited about this this thing is
so girthy oh she's deep yeah hold on
hold on you can't pull away from me has
a stand on an already oh now that is
Tula set up other than you too I guess
Wow awesome oh yeah that's right I
didn't even mention that before so we
are going to put a VR setup into this
little pseudo living room as well so
that was the reason that we put a plug
up there so we can run our lighthouses
without having to deal with any cable
wiring mess the stand on this TV is
probably like half of the weight really
oh my god this is pretty dang yeah I
know doesn't it look sick it looks
floral like you said let's go how did it
might be 30 on that's awesome
yeah yeah that's moderately sturdy
I hate ladders beats the former Wow I
just got that I was like what what is
the what was the ladder oh damn it
what do you reckon I reckon I'll be
alright mate that is a very long screw
for how heavy that thing is we got to
make sure it's tight cuz once there's a
bump and sub in here we don't want it to
vibrate away what kind of sub did you
get 500 watt 15 inch stuff yeah yeah I
never knew that the bfg would be so B
yeah it's really thick it's a thick boy
Oh Lord he'd come in it might be a
little high now for this that's where it
goes no one more one more yeah
so I totally forgot about this what we
haven't torn down the world's fastest
gaming machine hero is that twenty
eighty guys this is 220 ATT eyes with a
9900 kay it's this is literally as fast
as it gets
alright and conveniently because a Sue's
hooked us up with this monitor it's not
full of like msi stuff
oh so that worked out this a monitor
wait it does have an MSI motherboard if
I recall correctly yeah it does but Asus
graphics card so there you go I'm
totally in the way oh you're probably
gonna need this your mom's favorite
cable DP Wow
don't put that in the video it's gonna
go in the video now goes in everywhere
else
so one of the things that you need in
order to run the vibe wirelessly is one
of these puppies so this uses 60
gigahertz Wireless which is the only
wireless connection that's fast enough
and low latency enough to handle like vr
gaming without a wire what was our plan
for all these HDMI devices well the
sound bar has HDMI switching right yeah
it's got a couple inputs but that's it I
think all right so we got to use the
receiver good thing we have a harmony
yeah so this is like pretty much the
best like money for performance 7.2
channel you can get cool it's just
perfect for the five point one point to
set up we'll be doing later nice cable
managing all this gonna kind of suck I'm
just working on my 13th controller over
here oh my god I almost pull aligned us
oh my God look at this these almost look
like they're little like hi my name is
name tags just right down there do you
mind moving back a little bit that whole
table I need room for my ass your ass
nothing about VR makes you look like not
a nerd how do I look like a nerd nerd
like a big like not not a nerd Wow like
Rudolph the like nerd nose mask-wearing
nerd so what's going on i straight-up
cannot figure out how to turn this
display on because it's the switch yeah
but like then what there's buttons on
the bottom yeah I see the buttons but
like they don't do anything did you plug
everything for improperly you had the
HDMI plugged in Hey okay public of
gamers let's hit it
hey hey alright Big O it's Emma sighs
stupid they think they're ROG but it's
MSI elite gaming I don't know thank you
okay so I come bearing networking things
I figure we go hardline for everything
right that's pretty nice
hell yeah it's not gonna be long enough
that one is that one's not gonna reach
not gonna lie it looks like the people
over they were having way more fun than
us hey pay attention
to move she waited been asleep go walk
to a town she can really get I think
maybe it's not gonna ever fall off I
think I need a Linus tech tips cable tie
Hey oh this feels very sturdy are you
being sarcastic it feels okay to me no
okay do you find these tips helpful no I
don't leave I don't know how this switch
other's way on a more different switch
done dbrand done thanks deep brand I
think we need to like actually play some
video games yeah good luck alright your
device is ready to go boom this
controller suck do we have an Xbox
dongle in there oh wait are you saying
you get the Xbox one yeah there are
enough PlayStation controllers for
everybody he could use one we all got
one why would I want one of those why
would why would we all I don't want one
give me an Xbox one I'm gonna go into
device manager and disable the Xbox dog
community it's not even working is there
gonna be any rules or regulations about
washing your hands before you use
controllers or are we just gonna have a
disgusting mess of greasy controllers oh
we're probably gonna have a disgusting
mess of greasy controllers and I'll put
some wet wipes over there I'm never
coming here well I have a rocket
launcher I have a flamethrower
and a headbutt and a bomb or even bad
guys in this game yeah like how is it
supposed to be difficult or is this just
like one of those games were no I've
just you literally just run and shoot
things they don't even try and shoot
back this I just killed the devil why
you totally just sniped that do we die
everyone's supposed to get on it you
duck do we die if we don't get on oh
yeah this game sucks last yeah what the
hell
alright I don't know how any of the
characters work
Wii Fit trainer what really fit trainer
really what are you typing right now oh
your name God's God's dick oh god what

Jew supply babe

single fire mode yeah you're still
Murphy oh oh I suck indeed

revive himself after and we're lagging
again no no and you're dying I'm dead
that's it that's all you want to play
yeah I'm done I can't blame the gear at
least though because should we get a
roster review out of ten of Apex legends
apex legends you know what jury is out
for me but I am loving this setup that
was instead of ten
this is pretty sick I'm loving it
honestly like even though I we haven't
actually played any games that I'm
particularly good at like bro for us I
was playing a little while ago on my TV
at home of which does not have great
input like makes such a big difference
yeah the input delay on this is freaking
awesome I didn't even think about it
it's that good yeah ting is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction
imagine that imagine a phone company
that when you phone them they pick up
the phone
Wow and you don't pay extra for the
privilege you pay for only what you use
and the average ting bill is just $23 a
month per device if you're stuck in a
contract and you switch to ting they'll
cover 25% of your cancellation fee and
they've got lower mobile data rates than
ever just $10 a gig beyond the second
gig to find out if you'll save money on
ting just head over to Linus ENCOM and
try out their savings calculator you
enter your last couple of bills and how
much you paid and it'll show you how
much you'll save on ting we actually
used their voicemail to text service by
the way and published our number one 833
565 LTT VM to hear some messages from
our viewers I unfortunately don't have
access to think here in the UK but I
would love to get it would save me
roughly around about 10 pounds if you
were to convert it so I really hope
they're able to come over here into the
UK so lower your phone bill today at
Linus ENCOM and get $25 in ting credit
or towards a new phone in the ting shop
