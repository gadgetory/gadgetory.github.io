brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys we're at the
huge massive glorious Sony booth
checking up their head mounted display
and this really caught my eye because
when I first saw it I actually thought
it had something to do with oculus but
it's not really like oculus so what's
the main differences I can't I can't
speak for what it's not I can't speak to
what it is this is our second generation
of the head-mounted viewer the hmz t3w
it's it replicates really an indoor
theater but it just sits on your face
what's different about this one than its
predecessor it's completely portable so
we were talking earlier about gaming
gaming is a truly immersive experience
in this but so is watching a movie or
what have you
projects the equivalent of 150 inch
movie screen from about 12 feet away so
sipping this thing on when you're on the
airplane plugging in your audio the
content source for the video whether it
be from your tablet your phone PC or
what have you sit back on the plane and
enjoy a truly immersive the movie
experience
so essentially wherever you go if you
have an HDMI plug you consume whatever
media is on-air essentially yeah here at
the CES demonstrations we're doing where
we have a plugged into both the
PlayStation 4 and then tablets and
mobile phones it takes an HDMI IN so if
you're going from a tablet or what have
you I might use a MHL to HDMI connection
or if you're coming from your cable box
at home HDMI HDMI perfect now they have
two demos here one standing demo one
sitting demo the standing demo you were
just consuming content of a movie and
that was really interesting because like
you said on the plane in a car ride if
you're in the backseat hopefully not the
front seat wherever you are you can
consume me to media very easily and very
well it's it's I was surprised because
when I tried out the oculus I know sorry
the picture quality's not quite there
yet I know they're not released on all
that kind of stuff but you can
definitely see the pixels on this one it
was it was different I could see things
very clearly the display was really good
now can you tell me more about the
display yeah the displays are two OLED
panels and there are inches away from
your eye there's 720p panels engineers
tell me that the reason they're not
1080p is there to be a wasted resolution
since those panels are so close to your
eyes so twin OLED panels inches away
with
knows in between it just great 3d so
when this this product first came out in
the u.s. we called it the 3d viewer
people thought well I don't want to
watch 3d you don't have to so now we
name it they have not this play that was
probably pretty smart because when I
first said 3d viewer that's exactly what
I thought it was when I was playing the
game it's it's you weren't necessarily
controlling the car I know that's not
necessarily a thing yet but may possibly
be in the future
but it was cool because the car was
ripping down the racetrack and you could
look around as if you were the guy in
the in the vehicle so looking around
checking everything out and with that
crisp of a display like it's it's
interesting because oculus the one I've
tried it's also 720p and this is 720 120
feet but it's a completely different
experience
oculus you can see the pixel grid like I
said early on this one you cannot so
it's definitely awesome and I definitely
recommend trying it out so the
convention closed all we're trying to
finish our sony head map to display
video so we returned to canada i retired
the suit and now we're finishing it up
for those of you that are looking for an
oculus this is not an oculus in my
opinion if you're looking for an
extremely immersive VR experience you
should probably be going with an oculus
if you're looking for a really high-end
media consumption device say if you're
using a lot of public transit or
something like that this is a really
good idea it's really nice for movies
the picture quality is amazing but it
does have a price tag as well it's
looking around $1,000 plus depending on
where you live I know a few of you
Europeans are not going to be exactly
happy with the price tag at the end of
the conversion rate and stuff like that
but it is a really high-end device OLED
displays 720p that close to your face
looks great
etc etc thank you for watching our CES
2014 content if you want to see the rest
of our CES 2014 content I would navigate
to the channel and view everything
before this because I think this is
going to be the last video if you want
to see all the rest of our content that
we're gonna be releasing for 2014 as a
whole I would subscribe to Linus tech
tips and thank you to our sponsors title
