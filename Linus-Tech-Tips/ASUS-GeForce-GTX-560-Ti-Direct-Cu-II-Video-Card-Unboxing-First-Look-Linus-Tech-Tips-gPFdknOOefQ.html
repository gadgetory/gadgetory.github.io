to unbox for a little while this is the
gtx 560 TI direct see you too so
basically this is an aftermarket cooled
gtx 560 and once we open this up i'm
actually going to find out if it is also
a non reference PCB gtx 560 so the only
way to find that out is to open the box
which i'm a big fan of doing so the dual
fan design is evidently up to 20 degrees
cooler it uses direct GPU contact in
order to ensure that it gets well direct
contact with the GPU for the heat pipes
for better cooling performance it also
has super alloy power which blends
select elements under a sous exclusive
formula resulting in a 15% performance
increase 2.5 times longer product
lifespan and 35 degrees 35 degree cooler
operation that's quite a bold claim
voltage tweak technology allows you to
boost the GPU voltages via a sous smart
doctor to achieve up to 50% faster clock
speed over clocking capability may be
varied by different cards of platformers
fruitfully news reports which you
percent pastor okay ah something about
the card general technologies yes this
is a geforce card so it does support
cuda sli 3d vision
it supports even 3d vision surround when
you are in sli mode it is a 1 gig card
so it has a standard configuration as
far as memory is concerned and we're
gonna go ahead and get this opened up
ooh nice box look at that matte black
box with nice gold font on it I like it
I've come to appreciate fine boxes oh it
gets even nicer when we get inside look
at that you know how expensive it is to
bake a box of black on both sides you
guys have no idea
compared to just like a white box or
just a plain cardboard box it's much
more expensive so yeah as soon as really
put everything into the packaging of
this product nice to see them care you
know you can see the card itself is well
protected by nice closed cell foam here
ok what do we got here we got video
drivers ok gamer OSD smart doctor ok so
some asou software download the latest
from the isuzu website instead
ed okay here we've also got a quick
set-up guide look at that in color
I'm impressed again very impressed color
setup guide here you've got our
accessory department so that's its own
little box that's are going after raiser
at this point I look like amazing razors
pretty good pretty good packaging so
here's kind of a neat thing this is a
mini HDMI to HDMI adapter you can see
it's actually twist it at a right angle
so that plugging an HDMI cable in won't
interfere with plugging something into
the next over DVI port here we've got a
DVI to VGA adapter and to dual doable X
to single PCI and six pin power adapters
finally we have the card itself which
does not come in an anti-static bag so
I'm going to go ahead and assume but
this is anti-static phone this is a very
nice-looking part I'll tell you guys
that right off the bat here cuz it has
my favorite thing in the world
well my favorite thing in the world but
I really like it matte black PCB Bravo a
sous matte black PCB love it especially
with some of the new motherboards out
there on the p67 platform featuring
matte black PCBs this would go with it
just nicely you can also see they've got
tastefully accented colors to go with
their matte black so there's a little
bit of oh okay please don't do that
cats trying to steal the phone he loves
foamy such a brat no no there okay so
they've got tastefully accented colors
to go along with the matte black so you
can see the aluminum heatsink here that
is part of the direct see you cooler
right there you can see where the heat
pipe goes and if I can get exactly the
right angle here you might be able to
see where the GPU is down there there
that's the GPU that you can see through
the crack there okay and then they've
got a couple of suits logos which are
also nice like silver one of them is a
little bit askew but we can fix that
quite easily there we go we've got dual
6 pin PCI II power connectors required
to run this board and we've also got a
single sli connector
here at the top of the PCB so what that
means is that you have support for
two-way SLI
but not three way and not four way okay
duel fans these both look like eighty
millimeter fans and this is a kind of a
unique layout okay so you can see this
is oh this is kind of neat it's like
kind of a hybrid design so this is a
heatsink okay this is a heatsink with a
fan and then what a soos has also done
so that directly cools the GPU there's
actually slots in the heatsink or here
here and here where it looks like I'm
just going to look for them yeah it
looks like that's to give direct
ventilation here I'm going to try and
get a little bit more light for you guys
here to the memory chips see the memory
chips in there so that gives you direct
airflow over the memory chips instead of
relying on heat sinks to cool them which
can often just insulate them more than
anything else see more memory chips here
which are also have direct exposure to
airflow very clever little design choice
to make and then what you can see
they've done is they've actually put
those direct touch heat pipes down there
right over the GPU and then made a
little fin arrangement so this is it's a
heatsink but it's also a heat pipe
cooler so that means that both of these
fans are able to be effective at cooling
that GPU over there without a soos
actually having to use so many heat
pipes to spread out the heat load
because they're using a direct heat sink
and the heat pipe cooler so that's
pretty neat so this is the direct to you
tube cooler we've got some little red
accents that look quite nice we've got a
PCI Express 16x interface down here at
the bottom with a standard lock so I did
answer my own question when I saw that
it was a matte black PCB because in
video reference cards you don't use a
matte black PCB I don't see what else we
got here there's a little dedicated
heatsink here you can see it right there
for the MOSFETs that is for the voltage
delivery so that's on that side and you
can kind of see it from the top there as
well it's that one right there and let's
see what else we got
this is a nice metal shroud too they're
using a metal shroud for the cooler so
what that means is that it's not cheap
it's not plastic very very nice and
what's this this seems to be just a
plate for making the card more rigid
which is smart so you can see that this
is bolted into the PCB here in here and
it's also bolted into the i/o shield
here so that's going to give your card
instead of just being held in by the PCI
Express slot and the two screws here
it's going to give it a little bit more
rigidity so it'll actually sit flat I've
had many a card installed in my system
that kind of looks like this when it's
installed because of the weight of the
cooler okay
let's have a look at the back of the
card you can see that the directs you to
even though it has a slot here he's not
going to be doing non focus focus focus
you stupid thing it's not going to be
doing a whole lot of exhaust out of this
vent because the fan is actually like
way over here and there's no direct
airflow path from the fan to the vent so
this is mostly going to exhaust the air
inside your case so you do have to make
a trade off you got to decide what's
more important to me
do I want lower GPU temps over also more
overclocking on my GPU or do I want
lower case temps now remember you can
combat the internal exhaust just by
having a well ventilated case versus
having an external exhaust design for
your card like say for example the GTX
580 reference card that's over there
where it exhausts all of the air outside
of the case and I think that pretty much
covers everything I wanted to say about
the GTX 560 Direct see you - there's our
DVI ports there's our mini HDMI port
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of this card and I will do a follow-up
comparing it in terms of temperatures
against the reference design gtx 560 TI
that I also have oh I didn't even
mention yes this is a factory
overclocked card so it comes clocked at
eight hundred and thirty megahertz on
the core don't forget to subscribe guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
