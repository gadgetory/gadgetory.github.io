you use as your guiding principle for
the bill do you just kind of grab parts
that have similar looking boxes or do
you find like one part that you like
like say for example this GT X 1080 Ti
right here and then build everything
else around that no most people start
with some kind of a youth case or an
application like I want to build a
workstation PC or video editing one or I
mean this is probably the most common
one for our viewers what kind of
computer do I need to play poorly
optimized but super trendy new game du
jour on high settings
that's why NZXT reached out to us to
sponsor a showcase of their new let's
build configuration tool which we used
to order this puppy right here so let's
see how well that worked out for us
okay so the best way to describe how I
built this computer is going to be to
actually just show you so I'm gonna go
to lets build calm and begin by hitting
the big start button OOP
now we're looking at twenty-one popular
PC games across loads of different
genres including fps open-world realtime
strategy and of course battle royale so
the idea here is that you pick either
the exact game or games or type of games
you want to play you select your
monitors resolution your approximate
budget we entered fifteen hundred
dollars and then you choose a and D or
Intel so check this out we've got a rise
in base PC built around our price point
and right here an estimation of the
number of FPS that this system should
reliably get in our selected games and
NZXT is actually guaranteeing these
approximations to within ten percent of
what you're actually gonna see once
you're up and running of course though
we wanted to test that so we hooked our
machine up which with the one-page
instructions and corresponding stickers
on the i/o plate means literally anyone
can do and download in fortnight which
like lots of people was the one and only
game that we cared to optimize our $1500
gaming machine for according to the site
we're supposed to get around 98 FPS
playing at 1080p with the game's highest
settings epic and right out of the gate
quite frankly it looks like NZXT has
pretty much broken their promise because
we're seeing as high as a hundred and
thirty one hundred and forty hundred and
fifty frames per second that's looking
not bad I don't know what's my squad
doing haha they're all talking oh good
luck you guys like what kind of towns
are these we're like literally every
building is full of like guns and stuff
My partner is apparently still alive
somehow oh there's more guys
I think there's going to be oh they're
shooting at me oh I'm gonna die okay I
did 50 damage in the night time to go
off the edge so my team placed 11th
that's pretty cool after a few rounds by
the way we did end up with an average of
106 FPS once we accounted for all the
dips and loading screens and whatever
else so that is within 10 percent and if
this was the end of the video that would
still be pretty cool and this would be a
neat tool but it actually gives you way
more control than just the three broad
build outs you can step up or down
through more granular price points and
see how the FPS is affected in real time
or if you want to tweak your components
yourself like changing your case or
getting more RAM then you can do that
too so then you have all the information
you need you can just close the NZXT tab
and head over to newegg.com and order
all the parts right well they don't
actually want you doing that and there
are a couple of good reasons not to
starting with pricing so looking at the
complete price breakdown they give you
something that you won't necessarily get
if you buy a regular pre-built machine
from Best Buy for example so you can see
that you're getting all of the
individual parts at MSRP which is not a
guarantee across the board especially
for GPUs like the gtx 1070 that's here
in our build and second okay yes there's
a $99 additional cost in there but
that's not just like some weird made-up
fee they actually give you a unified
warranty on all of the parts and labor
for two years and they haul but to ship
your order out within 48 hours best of
all they actually build it for you with
by the way some pretty darn nice cable
management even in the parts you don't
see so then if you're looking for that
DIY control but you don't actually want
to or don't know how to build it
yourself and dexies let's build tool is
one of the easiest ways to order a
computer out there so thanks to NZXT for
sponsoring this video keep on building
cool tools for PC gamers
see what I did there that's bold humor
and I like my men like I like my
font:bold wait what are we talking about
so thanks for watching guys if you just
like this video you can hit that button
