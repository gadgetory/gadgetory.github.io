boundaries far beyond what anybody asks
for like when we brought you the PC made
of radiators cooling insane hardware
with zero fans what ever since then
we've wondered what would it look like
if some actually smart people tried to
achieve the same thing well today we get
to find out because the good people over
at Monster labo have done just that
creating a case that supposedly is
capable of cooling up to an intel eight
core ninety nine hundred K and an RT X
27 T completely passively but don't pass
by private Internet access private
Internet access gives you a safe and
protected IP and it's got loads of other
features as well check it out at the
link below
with this being monster lavas first
product actually it's even called the
first we were naturally a little bit
skeptical but now that we've built an
entire system inside it there actually
is some truth to their claims but more
on that later starting on the outside
the first has an understated look well I
mean ours does have a custom paint job
so it's visually a lot louder but
normally it's painted in either black or
white satin metal finish along with a
metallic accent piece which kind of to
me makes it look like a mini-fridge
but I'm not mad because with everything
else these days turning towards rainbow
barf I personally appreciate this a more
subdued look up top we get dual USB 3.0
audio and a British power button that
frankly just loves to get stuck around
back there is access to the psu and
that's about it with the motherboard i/o
relying on pass through cables limiting
you to five ports max on this oddly
unfinished backing piece it seems like
this was kind of an afterthought
especially since the included
DisplayPort pass food doesn't have
mounting holes and the HDMI pass-through
didn't come with screws but enough of
the boring stuff inside is where things
get interesting
after removing all three outer
clamshells and their accompanying 14
screws we finally get to get a glimpse
of the internals and right about now it
also starts to become apparent that this
case isn't for first-time builders or
even pretty experienced ones since we
ourselves were kind of lost at this
point but okay we're humble why not just
consult the manual because there is no
magic no monster labo instead opted for
a series of assembly videos which are
way more annoying to scrub through than
a regular print manual but nevertheless
they did help us find a few more screws
that were hiding behind this weird
fabric tape that we quickly introduced
to the trash bin once it is open up
though man is it ever cool-looking I
mean literally look at that heck and
heat sink its massive and the heat pipes
the head pipes oh he piped
both the CPU and the GPU each get six of
their own evenly spread throughout the
heatsink now I'm starting to think their
claims might actually have some merit
alright so time to throw some hardware
in it and boot it up right well because
of the first totally non-standard
mounting and form factor planning ahead
is kind of a must
thankfully monster lava has vetted a
bunch of hardware already with
compatible parts listed on their site
including what motherboards and GPUs
worked and what brackets or
modifications are necessary in our case
the triple found our TX 2070 we chose
was supposedly a non-issue all we should
have to do is remove the cooler and
strap-on monster llamas provided BRM
heatsink but it wasn't that easy the
screws for the vrm cooler weren't long
enough so we ended up having to use zip
ties to hold it all together it is worth
noting though that this accessory isn't
yet available so hopefully they'll have
all that ironed out by launch and then
again maybe quirks like this are to be
expected in this wacky realm of custom
cooling as for our X 470 motherboard it
to call for some minor modifications but
thankfully both went to subscribe first
it requires the use of their custom
riser which is only included on the
premium model so watch out for that and
second the audio chipset had to be
removed as on this board it's installed
on a riser and would otherwise block the
heat pipes this sucked so again plan
ahead don't be like us
we suck hopefully on Monster Lobos
second case the heat pipes are
positioned to better comedy boards like
this as daughter boards aren't uncommon
on ITX motherboards things did start to
look up though when it finally came time
to put all the pieces together that is
until we went to mount the motherboard
and found that there was no mention
anywhere of which bracket to use for
AMD's a.m. for socket fortunately though
monster lavas customer service was
pretty quick to respond and they
informed us that a.m. for boards
actually used two of the brackets in
tandem which was easy enough after we
figured it out once that was out of the
way the rest of the assembly was pretty
straightforward you might have to bend
the heat pipe just a little bit and
slide the motherboard and GPU mounts
back and forth in order to make sure
everything lines up properly but that's
apparently pretty normal installing
Coursera's SF 600 sfx power supply was a
walk in the park and if fan doesn't even
spin up at full load with this setup
nice storage wise we opted for a Samsung
m2 SSD for the first does advertised
support for three two and a half inch
drives along with one three and a half
inch drive if that butters your biscuit
just above the PSU is where the included
140 millimeter fan can be mounted or it
can be removed to accommodate full ATX
power supplies a nice touch but who
cares about all that we want to know
about performance and as you can imagine
with a high-end set up like what we
chose temperatures are simply not going
to be as low as with a fan cooled setup
but for something that's entirely
passive this is pretty impressive we did
notice when running without the fan the
2700 X loses some boost o'clock while
hitting 84 degrees Celsius under an eye
264 CPU load but if you remove the top
cover panel like they recommend it's
really competent monster Lavo does
mention that the actual passive TDP
rating on the first is only 215 watts
but you'd be hard-pressed to find an
application that would actually load
both parts to 100% power drop
consistently hence why you could run a
higher end config like we did once the
fan is added into plate temps are a lot
more comfortable
we sat hours to run at 700 rpm which was
inaudible even as close to a foot away
from the case speaking of inaudible the
coil wind from the GPU is not because of
the way it's positioned the GPUs power
distribution is right near the big fat
opening on the top of the case and
without the higher noise floor of a
typical fan cooled build the video cards
high-pitched whine is surprisingly
irritating even from a sitting distance
it sucks and I guess that's kind of
where the concept of these passive cases
starts to fall apart for me
coil whine IMO is actually way more
annoying than the low hum of a fan and
frankly with a decent a i/o on your CPU
and the gargantuan GPU coolers of today
most regular rigs
tend to be pretty inaudible anyway so if
it were me I'd stick to the a prevention
fan setup but if you're not an audio
file or just hate hearing your PC you
can find a GPU that doesn't suffer for
much coil whine and if you don't mind
your hardware running a little hotter
than most
this can be an awesome way to achieve a
nearly silent PC as for the first itself
for a $400 plus case it's kind of a hot
mess but honestly I love it I just like
it I don't know that I'd recommend it
full-on clearly one or two corners were
cut but it's just so freakin cool I kind
of looks like a like a build-your-own
