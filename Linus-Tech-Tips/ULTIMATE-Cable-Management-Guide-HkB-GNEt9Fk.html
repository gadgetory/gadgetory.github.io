infamous series the workshop we did an
episode where we demonstrated that cable
management tucking away all your cables
in most cases pun intended has no
tangible effect on performance or even
cooling so then when we set out to do
this cable management guide sponsored by
our buds over at Kim law we figured well
hell if deep down it's just about the
looks let's make sure it looks as good
as it can so here is how to cable manage
like a pro
the first thing we needed was a test
subject so we borrowed our triple headed
VR project machine it already looked
reasonably clean from the front but as
for the backside well eivin's excuse was
I was Russian now in fairness to him
though
this machine has six hard drives seven
RGB fans with individual leads to their
respective light controllers and to make
matters worse it's older-style
900 D chassis has no power supply shroud
so there is a visible rat's nest down at
the bottom to tame the overgrowth then
we'll need some tools we recommend a
pair of side cutters a set of small and
large zip ties and some double-sided
tape and also some basic cable mesh or
sleeving goes a long way
next you need to visualize remember guys
to have your wiring looking its best you
need to avoid any diagonal lines and try
to minimize crossings so you can't just
start tucking things away without a
clear end goal in your mind's eye in
fact this is so important that if you're
having trouble I would legitimately
suggest that you draw it out in paint if
you need keeping in mind of course that
due to small variances it is likely that
you'll end up having to make a few
tweaks as you go next assuming that
you're working on a system that's
already built begin by yanking out the
larger cables completely to get them out
of the way and cleaning up the small
ones with your small zip ties you should
use existing case crevices to hide these
small cables and you can also use that
empty cavity behind where DVD drives
used to go remember those
oh that's that's a good spot to hide the
extra length of front i/o cables on the
motherboard side use memory slot lines
to hide your runs and then while you're
at all of this keep in mind where your
thicker runs
go you can use those to hide your thin
runs later on planning
pro tip number one leave the SATA cables
for last because the drive side
connectors in particular are really
flimsy and they are surprisingly easy to
accidentally break off while you're
running or tightening something else
pro tip number two sometimes rotating a
fan can give its cable a cleaner run pro
tip number three label your fan
connectors this makes it easier to
reconfigure your airflow and your RGB
patterns once it's not obvious anymore
which cables belong to which fan pro tip
number four if you have a modular power
supply hide your unsightly power supply
side modular cables in the cavity behind
the psu tip number five if you can't
hide a thin cable run some basic wire
mesh makes it look a lot more
professional and flattening the run
beforehand helps to avoid snake meal
mesh bulbs tip number six replace your
existing double sided tape on things
like your RGB controllers it might still
be residually sticky but it is much more
likely to fall off after a reapplication
than not hot glue is also a pretty good
one here if you've been following along
so far you're well on your way but
you've probably run into some situations
where you have no choice but to commit a
cardinal sin
sometimes your stock cables are simply
too short to avoid diagonal lines what
would you do so one way around this is
to use the area between the motherboard
and the cases motherboard tray wherever
possible this technique is also popular
for making the front i/o cables look
cleaner on the motherboard side just
make sure you don't put anything too
bulky in there flex is not good for your
motherboard as for your graphics card
you got a couple of options here you can
run the power cables from the top down
for a little bit of sag support or you
can run them from underneath for a
cleaner look we opted for the straight
down method
since the extra two PCI Express power
pins ended up looking really ugly
otherwise there is also the new option
by the way of using a vertical GPU
adapter but these are for single card
setups only they are somewhat reliant on
case compatibility and the last issue
our machine has more than one GPU so a
time lapse later and using all the tips
that we just gave you you can behold
then the fruits of our labor our system
looks way cleaner both from the front
and from the back so thanks for watching
it no actually I'm just kidding this
wouldn't be much of an ultimate guide
without some custom cables from kala mod
would it now for many people only front
side looks are important so cable wat
extensions are a quick easy and
relatively inexpensive way to spruce up
your machines looks you only need a few
of them to make a noticeable difference
to the look of most machines for others
though extensions are about like putting
a park bench on a Civic and calling it a
spoiler so for them there are the
prepackaged cable mod replacement kits
which are available in a variety of
colors and patterns and for pretty much
every modular power supply model under
the Sun we are going one step further
cable mods ultimate offering custom
length and colored cables so to cut out
your system the first thing you need to
do is measure your run lengths but you
can't just do this any old way like
don't use a string we actually recommend
using a wire so we cut a 12 gauge wire
because this helps simulate the way that
the custom cables will actually Bend
once they're installed we're also gonna
try to address the clump of PCI Express
cables by the power supply by
calculating which cables we can run
hidden behind others it's important to
get each length of run exactly right and
make sure you're checking exactly the
terminal that you'll use because if you
measure the model to the same one
the end result might not align as
perfectly as you might like with our
lengths at hand we dialed them into the
configurator which allows details like
the number of pre-installed comb
and distance between SATA connectors and
then about a week later our pro cables
with thicker wires and pre-installed
combs arrived when you're looking these
up we actually suggest pre bending the
cables into the desired shape before you
install them it helps more than you
might think then right last but not
least we mentioned cable combs but you
should probably explain those cable
combs can be used not only to keep your
individually sleeved wires apart but to
ensure that parallel runs are indeed
parallel and they stay there ok then so
since all the cables were pre-made to
lengths installing them was an absolute
breeze and this is our real end result
so as you can see the front looks
cleaner er
the clump on the bottom is minimized and
then the biggest difference is on the
back especially when you look at the
before and after I mean it went from
something that we'd really rather hide
to something we'd actually want to show
up I mean maybe that's the next trend in
computer cases windows on both sides
oh wait they've actually been doing that
so thanks for watching guys if you just
