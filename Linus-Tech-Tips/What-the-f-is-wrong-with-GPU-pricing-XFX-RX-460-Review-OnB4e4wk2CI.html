cards it just doesn't seem to be what
you guys want I mean seriously in the
last year of graphics card launches our
most successful video covering them is
Linus being all like holy to a five
thousand dollar Quadro M 6000 and our
second most popular is the launch review
of the 1080 a card most viewers can't
afford not knocking you guys it's just
really expensive and not a great value
compared to its little brother the
bottom line is that it seems like the
internet would rather watch us react to
a Lamborghini then give a square
level-headed review of a Civic but that
won't stop us and we're back at it again
with a review of the rx 460 a video card
designed for mainstream and eSports
games at 1080p and aimed squarely at the
100 s dollar price point the sort of I
guess I'll need to address the absolute
mess that is graphics card pricing these
days
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description let's begin with the
look at graphics card pricing that I
promised the current AMD rx product
stack officially goes from 99 US dollars
for a 2gig rx 460 all the way up in
pretty well spaced increments to 239
dollars for the 8 gig RX 480
but this is all according to the
suggested price list that they give to
us when we're sent a card for review
which is the only pricing reference we
have when making a video for a card
before its release
so in our launch reviews when you see a
price to perform its comparison these
are the numbers were using their
official they're supposed to represent
the baseline price for this GPU and they
should be correct fortunately we're a
bit late on this card and it's already
available in stores which gives us the
opportunity to ask why the when looking
at newegg.com
is there only one single card in AMD's
entire rx product stack that is at MSRP
a reference rx 488 gig and I'm not just
going after AMD about this nvidia gtx
1080 no cards on new egg at $5.99 gtx
1070 no cards at 379 from any brand I'm
just mad about it because some people
make purchasing decisions based off
price to performance graphs it makes
sense and we make some of those graphs
based on the numbers that they give us
which has resulted in them being
unintentionally misleading this isn't
good for me then it's especially not
good for you but enough about that let's
dig into Polaris 11 in its desktop
flavor the RX 460 it's a
fourth-generation GCN architecture chip
on Global Foundries 14 nanometer FinFET
process it's got 14 compute units and
896 stream processors with reference
boards running at a boost speed of 1200
megahertz and a memory speed of seven
gigabits per second with a peak
performance of 2.2 teraflops less than
half of the RX 470 but still a lot
better than the hundred ish dollar cards
we've seen in the past it comes with 2
or 4 gigs of
five RAM depending on the variant you
purchase with a rated total memory
bandwidth of 112 gigabytes per second on
a 128-bit interface the suggested ports
are one DisplayPort 1.4 connector one
HDMI 2.0 B connector and one DVID
connector a fairly future-proof loadout
a typical board power is below 75 watts
meaning that like the beloved 750ti a
great upgrade card at the time for folks
with pre built systems it doesn't need
an extra connection from the power
supply and can daintily sip on it 75
watts of power through the motherboard
which brings us to the specific variant
we have today the XFX double dissipation
for gigabyte Radeon rx 460 with a metal
card extender an added PCIe power 6 pin
connector 2 large fans and a whopping 20
megahertz factory overclock it also
features easily removable fan clips but
not easily removable fans confused so
was I XFX has a technology called hard
swap detachable fans which features
these same clips and fans that connect
by touching contact points instead of
being directly wired in a really great
feature which looks the same on the
outside as this one but when you remove
these fans they just kind of dangle
their cool I guess but not as cool but
when's the last time you thought to
yourself gee yeah sure wish I could hot
spot my computer fans anyways
let's talk about benchmarks in DirectX
11 with Crysis 3 and rise of the Tomb
Raider it trails the r9 270 and the GTX
950 but does unsurprisingly wreck the
750ti moving up to DX 12 however we see
a bit of a different story it edges much
closer in Tomb Raider and actually beats
all but the gtx 950 in ashes of the
singularity and you can check out my DX
12 and vulcan video here to learn more
about why moving on we have some new
additions to our test lineup that i
specifically included because of the
positioning of this card
dota 2 counter-strike go and overwatch
all of these are mainstream games and
relatively easy to run but because there
is a highly competitive component
serious players are still willing to buy
a dedicated video card so they don't see
any day
sir stutters in the game and the most
interesting story here isn't necessarily
where this card slots against others in
the list it's more the fact that it's
theoretically anyways a very low-cost
option which manages to play all three
of these games at near 100 FPS or above
with medium to high settings that makes
the RX 460 a great choice if those are
the kind of games that you really want
to play and based on the kinds of views
that are value AMD builds from two years
ago have that's probably a lot of people
but the conclusion of this video isn't
that simple because this card costs a
hundred and fifty dollars only thirty
less than the MSRP for the arcs for
seventy a much faster card making it
much harder to recommend not that those
cards are actually available at MSRP
anyways mass drop in a nutshell they
take eager buyers lots of them and eager
companies with products to sell and they
connect them and the idea is that the
more people agree to buy the product the
lower the price goes that is to say to a
limit unfortunately you will not be able
to get the red scarf two custom keyboard
that we're covering today for zero
dollars but you will definitely be able
to get a better deal on it so this is
the virgin virgin ah this is the version
C of the red scarf - it is designed
without the ten function keys of its
predecessor and features a unique 68 key
layout it consists of a PCB and a CNC
aluminum case plate and feet and allows
for customization of the lighting layout
including ISO and ANSI it's fully
programmable allowing the user to
utilize the unique layout as they see
fit and there are a variety of choices
of anodized aluminum colors it comes in
black gray red or silver you can also
add a set of standard layout blank or
laser etched front printed PVD key caps
in Cherry profile and the lighting can
be controlled via a remote so to check
out this one and other drops check out
that link in the video description mass
drop has all kinds of great stuff
everything from keyboards to camping
gear so you can be a keyboard
warrior or a weekend warrior anyways
guys thanks for watching if you liked
the video like it if you disliked it
dislike it get subscribed all that fun
stuff if you want to buy a card that
probably isn't this one check out the
Amazon links video description down
below you can also see the link to buy
our shirts down there those are cool if
you want to discuss the value
propositions of different cards and
maybe the pricing in your area we can't
talk about the pricing in every
different country here but I know
there's crazy stuff going on all around
the world not just in the States and
we're even Canadians and there's crazy
stuff going up here too so yeah let us
know on the forum and I'll see you guys
next time watch this video which is our
review of the rx 470 a probably more
sensible card to buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
