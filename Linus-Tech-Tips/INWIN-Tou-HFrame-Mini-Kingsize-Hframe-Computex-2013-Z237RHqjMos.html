XCOM hey guys we're here at in Wynn to
check out the tow I hope I said that
right as far as I know it's Japanese
that's what I've been informed of and it
looks very very sharp it had some very
very thick glass panels are nice it just
said very a lot I got called out for
that in another video sorry it has some
extremely thick glass panels there we go
I mix it up and aluminium framing it
looks very sharp I can get b-roll to go
over to the side here to check out the
rest of the case as you can see on the
inside of it dimmed out there we go as
you can see on the inside it's not it
doesn't have all the features that you
might want in a case other than just
sheer amazingly good looks it looks
awesome they've water cooled it so you
can do that
although like I just said there isn't a
ton of room it looks very good
awesome aluminum framing very very thick
aluminum very very thick glass and a
very very thick price at $799 so you're
gonna have to have an awesome wallet to
get this awesome case in the front you
can see the front panel the normal front
panel there's a power button reset
switch dual USB three front audio
headers and I'm not entirely sure what
that LED mentions but it's there they
have an Odin Esau here although I would
not use that if I were you and then they
have touchscreen buttons I know they
touch me button for power I'm not gonna
press that just in case anything bad
happens touch screen button to control
the fans which is nice and to touch game
buttons to control the lights on the
inside now if I turn the lights all the
way down I'm gonna get be able to go to
the side here if you go to the side of
the computer you can see right now you
can see everything but when I turn the
lights down it actually disappears
that's very very very cool it's kind of
like a stealth mode they definitely did
not call it that but I'm gonna call it a
stealth mode it's cool it looks very
cool but that depends on how much you
think that's worth the coolness of the
case may not be worth seven hundred
ninety nine dollars for you or it is
that's off you decide we're gonna move
on another thing I had to cover here at
the end when booth was their new H
frames many of you will be familiar with
their original H frame which is right
here and it's standard blue and silver
form but the first one I'm going to
cover is the H frame many
it looks a lot like the original H frame
with a few less angles but still the
same general idea
just like cutouts of metal and a lot of
them going in a row with some glass it
looks very very industrial this will
look very cool on a desk although it may
not be the most functional case you can
see it comes with a power supply that
you're gonna have some trouble swapping
out but they will be available so the
power will run through its own rail at
the top here if I can angle the case and
get to the power supply in the front I
think I almost just cut my finger
not quite those are a little bit sharp
but that makes it look sharp so I guess
that's entirely fine then we're gonna
move down a little bit here to the king
size H frame this thing is nuts it has
the name king size for a reason I'm not
going to move their headphones although
I guess it comes with a headphone hanger
that's kind of insane I actually didn't
notice that last time I saw this case it
looks very Gundam although I'm not very
well versed in Gundam so I'm not sure if
that's accurate as an OTT slot up here
if you switch this red thing around you
can put one in or you can leave it the
way it currently is for looks there's
all the USB 3.0 headers you could
possibly want at the front with a reset
switch I believe that is and a power
switch with front audio headers that is
six USB 3.0 on the front that's nuts
we're gonna move up the stairs your old
didn't trip that is impressive to see
the inside of the case I know this glass
will not make it easy to see but there's
an Ares two in there and it Dwarfs it
this case is huge it's absolutely
massive there's tons of three and a half
inch base and two and a half inch base
in here for a lot of hard drives not all
the hard drives but a lot of hard drives
can get six hard drives in here at three
and a half inch and two at two and a
half inch and they have hot-swappable
back planes at least in the three and a
half inch bays although it's very hard
to see in there so I'm not sure about
the two and a half inch bays this is a
massive case that is a tiny case and
that is a see-through case thanks for
