unboxing of a very high-end board for
masseuse now the WS series of boards is
a little bit different from their
extreme Republic of gamers branding so
it's more of a workstation w/s
workstation oriented board but what you
will find here is actually I'll wait
till we get inside okay first of all
let's tell you what it says on the front
this is a core i7 or z on board so it's
an LGA 1366 board
it supports Tesla with CUDA of all
things okay again a workstation feature
it supports SLI and CrossFireX so it's
perfectly gaming ready all right it has
5000 hour vrn the blahblah 100% Japanese
made solid capacitors it has sass on
board again a very workstation oriented
feature because you do need a SAS
controller if you want to run 1500 are
15,000 rpm drives for example 16 + 2
phase power for your CPU EP 6 engine and
7 Gen 2 PCI Express 16x loves that is
what I was going to give away which is
that the 7 in the name but I guess they
spoiled the surprise on the front okay
they have Express gate super hybrid
engine it did it to do okay what do we
got inside first we have support for
3-way SLI and crossfire best choice for
intensive CUDA parallel computing so
those seven PCI Express slots you could
theoretically install as many as seven
single slot GTX 260 s which do exist
which would be a folding machine on a
board like this okay so 16 plus Q phase
power SAS onboard okay this is all the
same stuff from the front I'm not going
to bother to list it again this is the
same stuff from the front again that ok
so let's have a look at the board itself
in terms of accessories first so we've
got one of those firewire and USB 2.0
combo back plates ok thank you for that
then we have an SLI bridge remember you
don't need a crossfire bridge to come
with your motherboard because it should
come with your video cards then we have
what is this I'm gonna have to open this
to find out what it is because I haven't
seen this before okay it's
kind of small PCB okay oh cool
all right neat okay so this has the
onboard power and reset switches as well
as a diagnostic LED display okay so I'm
assuming that plugs in somewhere on the
board and well I'll put that aside for
now so that hopefully I can show you
later where it plugs into then we have a
3-way SLI bridge hopefully you've seen
one of those before you know what that
looks like
okay SATA cables we have six SATA cables
three of which are right angled and
three of which are straight then we have
one molex to 2 SATA power adapter then
we have oh we've got a couple of those
neat okay so these are these are kind of
these are SATs cables basically this is
designed to be a more secure connector
I've seen people use them for SATA as
well because remember a SAS cable is
pretty much the same thing as a SATA
cable so it plugs right into both the
power and the data and then off the back
of it you've got the power cable and
then a data cable so the whole thing is
built into one unit supposedly makes it
a little bit harder to dislodge then you
got the isuzu q connector okay in most
cases they come in blocks now anyways so
charm that big in the deal
there's your i/o shield here is your
user's manual which is which is
uncharacteristically thick you've also
got your suitcase badge as well as your
driver DVD don't use this download the
latest off the assist website all right
here we've got a lot of information in
probably a few different languages
no it's wow it's all English check that
out this is one thick all English manual
that's impressive okay let's get the
board itself up mmm which is very shiny
I like it already
there you go so like all LGA 1366 boards
this does support an LG a 13-6 CPU
you've got a load socket there in case
anyone cares there was some rumors going
around about load sockets being superior
so a Sue's has not gimped on the socket
right off the bat you've got support for
triple channel ddr3 memory up to 24 gigs
if memory serves then you have your
power
in its ideal location along the right
hand edge of the board
now these heat pipes I can't even begin
to tell you exactly what they're cooling
but I'm gonna go ahead and start taking
some guesses first of all I'm gonna
guess that this is cooling the power
delivery mechanism for love the ramp
okay so that heat pipe is coming out of
the chipset area where I'm assuming
they're using some size some sort of PCI
bridge chips probably at F 200 in order
to provide all of these PCI Express
lanes because the x58 chipset does not
support this many PCI Express lanes
natively ok so then moving on down the
board we've got six SATA connectors
which are powered from the x58 chipset
as well as two SAS connectors which are
powered off a third-party chipset so you
can see they're labeled here C 2 1 2 3 4
5 6 and SAS 1 &amp;amp; 2 then over here we have
our 7 PCI Express connectors now I
haven't done my research ahead of time
to be able to tell you which ones are
running at which speed let's see if
they've been nice and labeled them for
me no they haven't so let's just assume
they're all running at some kind of
mixture of 16x and 8x down here we've
got our USB headers as well as a
firewire header and front audio header
then we have the cooling solution for
setting an attached anything oh yeah
that is attached to something let's
attach to a Marvell chipset okay and
then it comes all the way up here and we
have more cooling radiators for the
voltage delivery system for the CPU then
we have our 8 pin power connector up at
the top of the board exactly where it
belongs top left and then let's move on
to the i/o at the back so you've got one
of those ps2 keyboard mouse combo ports
I love those then you have 1 2 3 4 5 6
USB 2.0 ports this is a bit of an older
board so it doesn't have support for USB
3.0 you have both coaxial and optical
digital audio out 2 Gigabit LAN 2 eSATA
which is really nice to see and 7.1
audio on the back you've got your
standard LGA 1366 backplate and they've
got the little stack cool to label here
which is basically allowing the PCB to
dissipate heat more effectively
throughout itself by using more copper
so it's a way of keeping things a little
bit cooler so thank you for checking out
my unboxing
the Seuss p67 workstation supercomputer
motherboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
