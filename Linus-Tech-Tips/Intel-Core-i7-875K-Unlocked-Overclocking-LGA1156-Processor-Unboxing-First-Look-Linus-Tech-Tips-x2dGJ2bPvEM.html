these two processors together because
they're very similar but I said no this
is going to be the unboxing of the Intel
Core i7 87 5k LGA 1156 processor this is
as I mentioned in my NCIX tech tips
episode about overclocking this chip one
of the coolest things out of Intel in
probably forever this thing is so sweet
because it is unlocked now unlike AMD
Intel hasn't really figured out the
performance cool looking box they still
got their standard blue and gray box but
that's their corporate colors none other
scissors here cameraman is trying to
hand me a pen to open the box but I had
a plan already
I was I was checking over there for the
scissors actually while I was doing the
introduction for this video so okay
carefully let's have a look at what it
features so Intel turbo boost technology
Intel hyper-threading technology smart
cache integrated memory controller dual
channel ddr3 LGA 1156 socket and this
this is a new one I haven't seen this on
a retail chip from Intel except they're
mobile processors thermal solution
required this tiny box does not include
a heatsink you have to get your own
heatsink Oh graphics card required
that's a cryptic thing for them to put
on the side of the processor box but I
guess they're there dual cores do
include a graphics core if you have an H
55 board okay fine Touche Intel Touche
so let's see what we've got included
here we've got a regular core i7 badge I
wouldn't have minded seeing like an
unlocked Edition or something on there
but it is what it is three year limited
warranty now this is a cool one too
because it used to be you had to use a
standard Intel om heatsink in order to
even qualify for their three-year
warranty on a retail chip now you don't
because they're requiring you to use a
different one um yeah a little bit more
on until not including a heatsink this
is the standard LGA 1156 heatsink this
thing sucks
this thing is designed for overclocking
and this is not good for overclocking so
as far as I'm concerned you're not
losing out on anything by them not
including this thing because you just
throw it away anyway
so here is the CPU itself okay it is a
quad-core it runs at 2.9 3 gigahertz it
has 8 Meg's of cache and I'm going to go
ahead and take it out here other than
the fact that Intel's worked their magic
special sauce into the inside to make it
unlocked which means you can adjust the
multiplier up and down you do not have
to adjust the base clock in order to
overclock this chip it is the same as
the i7 870 so it has 1156 pads on the
bottom and it has turbo boost all that
good stuff now the one really really
cool thing about this besides just
regular overclocking unlocked
overclocking which we've had on AMD
black editions as well as intel extreme
editions for quite some time is the fact
that you can overclock using turbo boost
and you should check out my video on my
NCIX comm channel to show you exactly
how to do that so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the i7 8 7 5k</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
