of routine for me first I switched to
the device entirely then I use it as my
daily driver for anywhere from two to
six weeks maintaining a Google Doc where
I dot down anything about it that pissed
me off
finally when it's time to actually write
the review I sit down with my list of
annoyances cross off all the ones that
were resolved either through software
updates or experience and then create
the script that I will eventually read
to you like this
well the Galaxy Note 9 is bunning up my
formula here because this is all I got
so let's see if we can pad that out into
seven minutes or so pub G Mobile is a

video description
I covered most of the surface level
stuff about the note 9 in my unpacked
video but now that I've spent some more
time with it I have some thoughts to add
economically the boxier shape of the
note 9 compared to the s9 plus that I've
been using as my daily driver has been
an adjustment as has the additional
weight but one of the most meaningful
tweaks that Samsung made to the form
factor was widening the bezels this
results in a slightly worse screen to
bezel ratio which is a risky move at a
time when competitors like Oppo are
going as far as to put in motorized
camera mechanisms so they can keep
pushing the envelope but from a
usability standpoint it's been a
noticeable improvement especially when
reaching across the screen the other
economic stand out to me is the Bixby
button now I assumed that there would be
first party support for disabling it
again
but for some reason Samsung as of the
time we're recording this has removed
that option overall though like I don't
actually hate Bixby she runs locally on
the device which means that on top of
the additional functionality that other
assistants can't handle like executing
voice macros she is noticeably faster
for transactional things like turn on
the flashlight but that's a double-edged
sword because compared to the Google
assistant which runs in the cloud Bixby
is still over a year later far less
likely to understand me the fingerprint
sensor has been moved into the center
just like on the s9 series but I
actually didn't notice it that much
since I ended up using intelligent scan
Samsung's unique combination of iris
scanning and facial recognition most of
the time anyway so now we're at the part
of the video where usually I list out a
bunch of specs but it's a little bit
complicated this time which processor
you get under the hood of your note 9
will actually depend on your region now
the good news is that it doesn't
actually matter too much we only got one
so we couldn't do a head-to-head
comparison but basically the snapdragon
845 Adreno GPU is stronger for your
gamer while samsung's internal tuning of
the Exynos 98
ten CPU seems to give it the edge on
that side of things honestly though
we're kind of splitting hairs at this
point and Samsung knows it they hardly
even talked about performance in their
keynote because phones have basically
succumbed to the same failing of Moore's
Law that we've been dealing with on the
PC side for the last five years now so
whether you're running a note 9 or a 1 +
6 for literally half the price you can
expect basically the same performance in
your pocket at least from idle now the
water cooling marketing nonsense aside
the big heat pipe that Samsung is using
in the note 9 does actually result in
relatively little throttling even in CPU
intensive tasks and that I think right
there is the most remarkable thing about
the note 9 not the heat pipe
specifically but the fact that it's
bigger than yours and they managed to
squeeze that the s-pen the four thousand
milliamp hour battery that's big enough
that even with the weird battery drain
bug that I get sometimes I still managed
to make it through the day they crammed
basically everything into this phone
other notable inclusions up to 8 gigs of
lpddr4 memory that's in the 512 gig
storage version ip68 water resistance
NFC high speed wireless charging microSD
expansion a headphone jack and stereo
speakers Samsung by the way with their
spectacular HDR OLED displays and
flexible audio connectivity continues to
deliver hands-down the best mobile movie
watching experience so here's the thing
almost always when I'm working on a
phone review because I actually switched
to them as my only phone I wish that I
you know had the form factor of phone X
with the features of phone Y and the
camera of film Z or something along
those lines most recently I was actually
working on my full review of the Oppo
find X and I was crestfallen when I
realized that it doesn't have NFC I mean
that's apparently not a big deal in
China but I use NFC for two-factor
authentication on a very regular basis
it was a real bummer for me and
no.9 the camera hasn't changed much
since the s9 series but that's not
really a terrible thing it's low light
performance is still outstanding and
everything from well-lit indoor stills
to more challenging scenarios like
poorly lit video came out as well as I
would expect from any flagship
smartphone today as for the new
Bluetooth enabled s-pen as a not really
a stylist guy it's mostly a handy little
bonus and you know you can write on the
screen even when it's off I guess that's
pretty cool
but I mostly didn't find many occasions
to use it even including the remote
camera shutter functionality with that
said I expect some really cool things to
come out of the s-pen once the sdk lens
until then assuming that you can afford
one because it's not cheap the note 9 is
gonna have to settle for being just the
zero compromises smart phone a
designation that I have never given to
any other handheld thanks to pub G
