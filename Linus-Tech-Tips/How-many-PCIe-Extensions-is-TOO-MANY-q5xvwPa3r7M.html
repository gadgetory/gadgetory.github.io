pewter wall computer wall Peter get it
anyway one of the challenges was having
the graphics card on the opposite side
of the frame versus the motherboard I
mean this thing was so far away that
there wasn't a single PCI Express riser
cable on the market that was able to
reach so the solution use war PCI
Express risers we actually ended up with
a one meter thermal take premium
extender chained to a 30 centimeter one
and we pulled it off with no performance
degradation whatsoever the system works
perfectly fine which got us thinking
just how far can you go before things go
haywire stick around while we uh snake
our way to the conclusion
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel bear the simple VPN app starts
your seven day free trial at the link in
the video description okay so to kick
off the experiment we rigged up our
standard GPU bench machine so it's a
known good machine our PCI Express
signal integrity should be about as good
as it can get
then we needed an extra piece so we also
hooked up a separate power supply for
our GTX 650 Ti graphics card this is so
that we don't actually run into power
cable length limitations if the
experiment goes completely off the hook
also having an excuse to call out to
eivin like he's far away is a bonus so i
hit the power switch check off so I did
cache that can you repeat hit this I'm
right here
oh engaged in exhilarate hour now thank
you
Roger don't have recognition I'll turn
on the system so to kick things off
we're gonna be using a single one meter
extension plus an additional 30
centimeter extension that's a total of a
hundred and thirty centimeters this is
the same as what we did for the wall
puter one more lower there you go
stress us go so it's running perfectly
as expected which means it's time to
kick it up a notch baby let's take it to
a hundred and sixty centimeters would
you look at that still no dropped frames
let's add more look at this ridiculous
yeah
down down down right there yep Oh 1.9
meters our PCI Express extensions are
almost the height of Darth Vader
okay so we're adding another forty
centimeters this time you can tell those
thermal tape guys have a lot of
confidence
if they sent us this much pci you riser
I am excited this was the best PCI
Express riser technology we had around
here so these aren't even shielded these
you legitimately can't go very far with
like I tried daisy-chaining even two of
these together and I had trouble with it
so oh do we have failure okay let's try
disconnect and reconnect just to make
sure that we're being fair to it come on
baby is the 650 TI PCIe gen3 yep okay so
maybe our load just isn't demanding
enough maybe we need to bring out the
big guns
a Titan XP ok so let's shut it down and
let's try again
so look at this ok so do you remember
back when they launched this thing there
was a bunch of press around the missing
PCIe pins look check this out so these
are power and then this is all data and
Nvidia swore up and down
makes no difference makes no difference
now we don't know if this is because
it's gen 3 or if it's because it
actually has all the pins but what we do
know is that our 650 Ti didn't go as far
as our Titan XP at the same resolution
I mean arguably this is a bit of an edge
case but no one can say this scenario is
some little friend stretch I think we're
gonna have to go even further straight
to 3 meters should we do it Yolo okay
this is ridiculous I mean why would
anyone need to know we need more table
we need more table you have to hold the
monitor now this is what happens done
the other thing even out there in the
relationship how many times I have to
say it not yelling at you I'm yelling
with you okay be honest with me though
are we expecting this to work no comment
it's on no artifacts or anything this is
crazy
how's it doing though 120 FPS same as
before we're still getting the same
frame rate no weird anomalies three
meters that's like 10 feet for Americans
add 30 or add 60 do I really have to
scream Yolo
okay monitor over on the other side and
then just hold the graphics card here
this is insane that's the last piece we
have yeah three point six okay no one
come through this door
no it's still working
no way wait maybe that's all we got oh
oh it's at postcode 40 now same as last
time same as last time okay hold on
let's shut it down though let's I'll do
a quick reconnect of all the things okay
hold on
also keep in mind that these are not
powered so perhaps it's not even signal
loss is just power loss oh you could be
right three two one blast off no look at
this look at this
3.6 meters you could literally have your
graphics card in another room okay hold
on I gotta run fur mark though
show me the 120s Oh No
Oh no-ho-ho the FPS is going up though
it's at 55 after 86 25 14 oh no it's so
borderline
oh just chases me every time welcome to
that oh okay well I think we've reached
the limit ultimately we failed when we
tried to Yolo too hard but I still
consider this a success
three meters of PCI Express extension
and we managed to get it running at a
and equivalent to having it right in the
socket 120 FPS so thanks to Thermaltake
for providing all these PCIe risers and
thanks to the slab for holding the
graphics card how's that 85 degree GPU
right there I stay holding my hand
against a HUD backside today's video is
brought to you by LG's share the art
promotion featuring their ultra
lightweight LG gram laptop LG works with
a coffee artist who came up with three
pieces of artwork inspired by the Graham
