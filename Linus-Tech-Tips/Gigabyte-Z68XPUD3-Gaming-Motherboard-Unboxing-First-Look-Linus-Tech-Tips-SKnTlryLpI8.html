innovative z68 boards out there this is
the Z 68 XP ud3 from gigabyte gigabytes
usually pretty good at calling out their
key features on the packaging so here
you can see it's the biggest feature
there there's an onboard M SATA
connector whistle what that means is you
can use intel's srt caching feature
using a little onboard M SATA Drive
rather than installing an SSD in the
actual system drive base so it's very
very compact very very cool feature okay
so it has a three year warranty in the
USA and Canada has ultra durable three
supports nvidia sli as well as AMD
crossfire x it uses touch bios to
support three terabyte plus drives it
also has dual BIOS which enables you to
restore the BIOS even if you corrupt it
during a flash drive or MOSFETs all
ferrite core chokes all lower RDS
MOSFETs and all 50000 our Japanese caps
mean that even though this is a UD 3
value board it has very high build
quality finally up to four times faster
performance using Intel SRT technology
means that you can install that M SATA
SSD get way better performance and you
don't actually have to buy a
high-capacity SSD for your system let's
see if there's anything on the back they
have to say for themselves 3x USB power
is a great feature it allows you to run
a hub or run higher powered devices off
of your USB ports it does support USB 3
as well as say 2 3 6 gigabit per second
so let's get this baby opened up here's
our little guide telling you not to
install an 11 56 CPU that's good advice
we have a user's manual and i/o shield
with color coding as well as a driver
DVD which you should throw away and
download the latest off 2 gigabyte
website Intel Smart Response technology
so up to four times faster performance
these are this is actually has a basis
in reality unlike some manufacturer
claims on products yes it does perform
way faster using an SSD as a cache then
with only a hard drive you've got a
multilingual installation guidebook
Dolby home theater sticker as well as a
powered by gigabyte sticker an SLI
connector black flexible my favorite
kind as well as two straight and two
right angle SATA 360
a bit per second cables here on the
motherboard itself we find a motherboard
let me try it from the other side yeah
there we go ok so let's take it out of
the package now this is a value oriented
board but high fault high build quality
and good features mean that you can
actually build a very very decent system
we run something like this throw a 2500
K in there Oh give me a sec throw a gigs
around in there throw a gtx 560 or an HD
6870 something along those lines you've
got a very potent little gaming system
so here you can see the power design is
a six plus one phase power we've also
got a nice little mosfet cooling
heatsink up here in terms of the overall
layout it's pretty standard you got your
LGA 1155 socket supporting core i3 i5
and i7 processors you got your eight pin
power in its ideal location up at the
top left edge you've got support for
dual channel ddr3 memory these are
clearly color-coded so you won't install
them in the wrong slots your 24-pin
power is all along the right-hand edge
in it's also ideal location we have
eight SATA ports ok so these guys are
running off a third party chipset those
are SATA 3 six gigabit per second ports
these are running off the Intel chipset
all six of these the white ones are SATA
three six gigabit per second and the
blue ones are SATA 2 three gigabits per
second and apparently SATA port five
will be disabled when the M SATA slot is
in use so those are wired up to the same
port on the chipset itself in all
likelihood here's your front panel
connectors here's your front USB three
there's the front powered USB two so
that can be used to charge tablets even
high powered devices we have two more
front USB headers front firewire as well
as a front audio header in terms of the
PCI slot layout we've got a pretty good
layout here we've got two PCIe 16x slots
although this one is wired only for 8x
so if you're running SLI or crossfire
you're going to be running at 8 X 8 X
speeds we've got two one two three PCIe
1x and 2 PCI now if you install two dual
slot cards you're going to be left with
one PCI and two-piece
ie 1 X slots and here is the M SATA
Intel Smart Response technology port
here so you just use the little
retention clips you plug in an SSD there
and you can use that SSD in order to act
as a cache for a hard drive that you're
using as your system boot drive so
that's in some ways a little bit more
convenient and a little bit lower
profile than actually installing a
separate drive running a separate cable
and that's kind of more of a hassle than
this ok moving along to the back we've
got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 USB 2.0 ports a ps2
keyboard mouse combo port optical audio
out firewire HDMI 2 USB 3.0 ports
Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1 audio now this
HDMI port is very useful because you can
use it in order to run lucid virtu which
means you can use the onboard video on
your CPU for things like transcoding and
use the dedicated graphics installed
down here for your gaming needs now the
fan headers on this particular
motherboard we've got our CPU for pin
PWM up here we've got a 3 pin right here
we've got a 3 pin here a four pin PWM
down here and that's pretty much it this
is a value board so you tend to see a
little bit less in terms of things like
fan headers don't forget to check out my
