in the one and only slicks room Betty
breads and apparently he's seven doing
his car strikes much cover no seriously
though here we are he claims he's taking
it down this weekend but I don't believe
it for a second because I know he loves
thick composure welcome to my unboxing
of the Radeon HD 7970 dual X OC from
sapphire this is an overclocked card
that is based on the 7970 GPU which
means you've got three gigs of gddr5
memory at ludicrous clock speeds you've
got a 28 nanometer GPU supporting all of
the latest technologies you've got dual
BIOS which means that you can set
different overclocking profiles within
different biases and it also means that
if a flash fails for whatever reason you
can recover it relatively easily
compared to prior cards the fact that
it's got the dual X cooler means that
you've got significantly better cooling
than the stock fan and I'm going to be
covering that in an upcoming video where
I compare the dual x cooler especially
in an overclocked scenario against the
reference cooler and okay cooler and
quieter overclock ready PCI Express 3.0
is like you know what won't we talk more
about the technology once we get the
card open because I'm sure that's what
you guys want to see not like you know
this and you know
that kind of thing you guys are
interested in the graphics card because
I know what you guys are all about all
right so here we go
we find the video card inside I'm just
gonna put that away and force you guys
to learn about the accessories before
you get to see the graphics card itself
I haven't actually seen one of these yet
so I'm kind of excited to check it out
we've got an HDMI to DVI adapter so that
means the card will support dual DVI out
of the box no problems we've also got a
mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter which
means you've got all the adapters you
need it's this active or passive that's
an active adapter so you got everything
you need to run umm Eyefinity out of the
box
you've got 4 pin molex to 6-pin PCI II
adapter and then a Oh a dual molex to a
pin PCIe adapter these are rare I'm
gonna hold on to that alright what else
we got here mini DisplayPort to sideways
big DisplayPort
good thinking sapphire and I'll show you
why that's important actually I set
aside crossfire bridge DVI to VGA
adapter and finally an HDMI cable so
that is I think they even say how long
it is on the front includes
HDMI cable haha that is a 1 point 8
meter HDMI cable so that's about 6 feet
driver installation CD don't worry about
that download the latest off the AMD
website ok registration card cool and
finally a quick start guide showing you
how to quickly start it's a guide
alright ah so let's go ahead and throw
that back in there you know what let's
just let's just get all this out of the
way completely ok so this is the 7970
you know what I just realized it doesn't
actually say anywhere that this is an
overclocked card so I guess we'll find
out if it's an overclocked card I know
that it's very easy to turn it into an
overclocked card actually just a sec
sorry guys so yeah it's very easy to
turn it into an overclocked card using
em back to the front of the box the
Sapphire tricks tweak and overclock
utility for sapphire graphics cards so
you can use that
turn up the clock speed of the car and
79 70s are already renowned for being
phenomenal overclockers so I've my
expectation is you'd be able to achieve
a fairly significant overclock with this
card so this uses as you can see a
completely non-reference cooler so this
is their dual X cooler this has dual 92
millimeter fans five heat pipes
including two fat you know pH 82 fat
heat pipes and the reason that they're
using the two thicker ones is because
these ones have further to carry away
the heat so they need to be a little bit
more efficient than the ones that are
located directly over the GPU core
itself you can actually see where the
GPU is right down there can you see that
cool the sec nope never mind um
and those ones are going much closer to
where they're going to be cooled
directly by the fan so you can see we've
got two going off this way and one going
off this way positioning them right
under the fans also these fans not only
cool the GPU self but also the
components on the PCB so that means your
memory which is covered by heat spreader
so I'm going to show you the sort of the
heat spreader as up here and over here
and kind of there yeah and it's you can
see it here you can also see it down
here you see that heatsink right there
that's that's covering the vrm here
these ones you can see are covering any
of the memory chips any other
miscellaneous chips that need cooling so
they're going to be directly cooled by
these fans as well so finally let's see
what else we got here as far as cooling
goes that's oh yeah sorry okay so I
always like to cover this compared to
the reference cooler which is a blower
design which exhausts all of the air on
the back of the case these perform
significantly better and we're talking
up to 1520 degrees under load better
than a reference cooler they're also
quieter due to the dual fan design and
the like phat ludicrous heat pipes that
are going on however the drawback is
that if you don't have a case with
adequate ventilation these can be a bit
of a problem for the temperatures of the
other components in your system so make
sure you got a decent case and then you
have nothing to worry about okay moving
on what
up here dual-x is actually a pretty
slick looking card slicker looking on
slicks broom right not going to stop
harping on that
ah so power requirements we've got a six
pin and an eight pin power connector at
the back of the card in their usual
locations on the back of the card we see
we've got a black PCB which in my
personal opinion is more attractive than
pretty much any other approach to that
we've got dual crossfire connectors so
you can configure these in any number of
manners in crossfire there's our
switches for BIOS one and two there's
your little switch so you can switch
between different BIOS profiles that you
load onto the card next we've got our
PCI Express 3.0 16 X slot providing up
to double the bandwidth vs. PCI Express
2.0 however that does not turn into a
doubling in performance so that's you
know I mean you might see a couple
percentage here and there where you are
bandwidth limited but usually that's not
the bottleneck where this is even more
of an advantage is on platforms like Z
68 or the upcoming z77 where your SLI or
your crossfire slots are going to be
running an 8 X 8 X mode now pcie 3.0 8 X
has the same bandwidth as the last
generation PCI Express 2.0 16 X so
that's where you really see that play
out well for you okay so in terms of
Eyefinity you're going to want to use
one DVI and too many display ports
because if you're running a 120 Hertz
1080p panel or anything above 1080 or of
1920 by 1200 HDMI won't be enough to
drive it however if you are running
triple 1080 PS then you can go DVI HDMI
and one mini DisplayPort although the
card does support up to 4 outputs using
all four of these connectors bearing in
mind though that if you want to use DVI
and HDMI you have to use an active
adapter for the DisplayPort ports let me
go see if there's anything I've missed
here so crossfire X is red AMD Eyefinity
2.0 so that's the next generation of
Eyefinity including support for stereo
3d we covered three gigs of memory three
gigs of memory is a big advantage versus
the competition so the GTX 680 does
outperform the 7970 at stock clocks
however once you start over
walking especially if you're not
comfortable over bolting as you guys may
or may not have seen in my GTX 680
review the performance gap narrows
significantly and the 7970 starts to
look like a better performer then
there's the fact that it also has three
gigs of memory onboard what that means
is if you're running a triple monitor
setup you have to load those textures
into the memory of your card regardless
because yeah it's not running a triple
monitor setup we're laughing at his
monitors they're awesome
um right you have to load all of those
textures into the graphics memory um
even if you have multiple cards it all
has to go into each graphics card so the
higher the resolution you're running at
the more you need that memory especially
for modern games and upcoming games so
that's a big advantage I think for the
7970 for multi monitor gamers and I
think that pretty much covers it it also
supports 4k displays as well as HDMI
with 3d and thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the sapphire HD 7970 dual
X graphics card I look forward to doing
a little bit of an overclocking
comparison as well as cooling and
acoustics comparison verses the
reference 7970 and I can tell you guys
now my expectation this is going to
absolutely blow it away don't forget to
subscribe for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos sorry guys I
promise to talk about why this was so
important and I totally forgot so this
is important because once the card is
installed in your system and you go like
this if you had two adapters that went
this way or even one adapter that went
this way you'd be blocking other ports
with the cable that plugs into it and
with the wideness of it so that's why
this is way smarter than other
implementations that i've seen of these
kinds of adapters in the past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
