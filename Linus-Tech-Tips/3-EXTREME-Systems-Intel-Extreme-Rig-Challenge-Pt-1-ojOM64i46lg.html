competition where system builders work
to create the most extreme gaming rig
utilizing intel's unlocked 7th
generation Core i7 processor and their
600p SSD Intel asked us to visit and
check out six of the final systems that
you guys voted for
my name is Alexis Roselle and I'm the
social media manager here at Origin PC
we flew all over North America and the
US and Canada to take a look at the top
six films for the Intel Extreme read
challenge and the people behind them
Origin PC was founded by Richard Hector
and Kevin they were part of the first
ten guys that started Alienware when
Dell came over and took took over
Alienware they decided to stick to their
roots and create custom high-end pcs I
think what excites us the most is being
able to become completely creative with
our builds design something entirely new
mostly just create something that's
never been seen before so in this
instance we looked at last year's rig
that we submitted for the Intel rate
challenge we thought how can we do it
even better this time we want to do the
world's first two VR systems in one so
that friends can play together in the
same location we want to always do
something that makes us stand out from
the crowd and do something completely
different from your standard rig the way
we do our builds for example the new kV
Lake from Intel is very very efficient
so we don't have to go as hardcore on
the cooling giving us more space in our
bills to do a bunch of unique and new
things that we haven't tried before
Intel's new m2 they're fantastic because
they're very space efficient so we can
put them in a much smaller form factor
so our desire for every PC leaving our
facility is that it handles whatever
stone at it whether it's 4k gaming or vr
gaming at the highest settings or if
it's a workstation PC we wanted to be
able to handle rendering and engineering
or anything that they want to do with it
we want them to feel secure that they
were able to customize it to their
liking to make it their own we want
their service from beginning to end to
be phenomenal and something that they'll
always remember I think will win because
we have something completely different
that we haven't done before we have two
high end systems and one got LCD side
panels which can display what they're
seeing in their VR helmet or just create
an awesome screensaver that will show
off the system if something completely
new I think it really makes us stand out
I know that we're going to win this
year's Intel rig challenge then it was
time for main gear in New Jersey well
you really won oh what'd I do
what's up guys I'm Wallace I'm the
founder from inger I oversee every
design from its inception to all the way
down to production as a matter of fact
in 2017 I will be signing every single
manual that leaves the company nice are
we doing that rocking the extreme rich
challenge allows me to go beyond what we
normally do what we normally do is
already beyond what most manufacturers
do we're set apart from other system
builders not just by the product starts
at the product we need to make sure our
products are unique right and when we
seek inspiration from the automotive
world the way the systems are assembled
here in our factory it looks like a
Ferrari shine we have mechanic car's in
the shop even down to when you unpack it
the election fresh car we spray new car
scent in every single system these
little touches is what we do really
really well so all the hands has been
that renewed I had going for one man one
machine and all the ways to get out of
boxes spins you need to make sure that
you actually feel good when you open it
and it smells good I'm just lifting your
system when you get it pretty cool I
don't think anybody else knows that
direction on the body shot just to paint
these computers
all right so like the color choices from
a 750 horsepower Hellcat the fittings we
wanted to make it look like a mod like a
car and that's that's a little the
principles that we apply to every system
in this case the r1 is actually
inheriting a lot of these features a lot
of the these aesthetics and will bring
me from you know from that world we're
actually bringing to this system this
mod it's being done for you it's not
coming off an assembly line that has a
parallel loop cooling system the CPUs
getting fresh water inside the defeated
sting time we play to win we design the
system to make sure that we win every
category has over twelve hundred dollars
in fittings this is just chrome fittings
the expenses but it's worth it pretty
much next door to our office in Richmond
British Columbia is NCIX my name is
Nathaniel and I am the our Dean project
coordinator for NCIX PC meaning I like I
like to build computers or like for
people to notice the small things that
nobody else sees through all the cable
management and the raving work on
everything it's the little details that
really pulled together that I want
people to appreciate and notice I
designed the new systems play around
with new technology figure out how it
works and how we can offer it to
customers with the engraving I wanted to
tied into the Zeus
Gladius and spatha Mouse and I was just
really inspired by the design that they
put on those keyboards mice and I wanted
to carry that on to the PC to make it
feel like it's one entire package what
really sets my computer apart is that
it's on a vest arm and it's floating
above the debt like it's a gift from the
computer job I am such a stickler for
detail that I redid the two being twice
and I rebuilt the system three times
because I didn't like a particular bend
or it wasn't perpendicular or it wasn't
parallel with the rest of the system
and just being ready to play with its
moment it comes out of the box seeing it
go off into the wild what's another
person makes me a little distraught but
I know that they're going to take care
of it and I know they're going to love
it and enjoy it as much as I do the
winner will be announced at PAX East and
there's still time to get out there and
vote each vote enters you for a chance
to win one of these systems so go now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
