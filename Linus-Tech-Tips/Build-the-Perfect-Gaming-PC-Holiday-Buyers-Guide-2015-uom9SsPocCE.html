punishment or maybe it's because your
strong objections to my component
choices but I am back with another
holiday buyer's guide for the gamer in
your life who's been really really nice
this year whether that's your child
brother sister or just yourself
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
in the video description to learn more
as usual we'll be targeting three
different price points in US dollars
before operating system under $500 nine
hundred to a thousand and about two
thousand dollars I'll be using pricing
from Newegg us as guidance since they're
sorting features are excellent and their
pricing is generally very similar to
other sources like Amazon calm and NCIX
and I will have a link in the video
description to all of the products
mentioned so let's start with just game
a high quality capable 1080p gaming box
that doesn't sweat small stuff like
upgradability or future-proof Ness if it
doesn't make the FPS number go up it
does not go in this rig so for our CPU
choice here
Intel has priced themselves completely
out of the race with their least
expensive quad core a must for some
modern triple-a titles sitting at 185
dollars us over a third of our budget
AMD by contrast has a variety of budget
multi-core CPU options including the
athlon x4 860 k which is 70 bucks for a
chip with 4 steamroller cores and a heat
sink in the box
it supports dual channel ram but because
our msi a 68 hm e 33 v2 motherboard only
has two RAM slots we for went dual
channel operation with a single 8 gig
stick of kingston valueram here this
gives us the option to upgrade to 16
gigs of ram and dual channel in the
future if we buy a similar stick and
have a little bit of luck for the case
and power supply I generally don't
really recommend combo bundles because
the power supplies included in them are
frankly usually barely worth the metal
that they're housings are made of but
coolermaster is somewhat of an exception
here so we went with their elite 350
case with an included 500 watt power
supply it's nothing too sexy but it'll
get the job done and it has the
appropriate 6 pin PCI Express connector
for our gtx 960 2 gig graphics card that
one was a tough choice because 2 gigs is
about half the frame buffer that am
he offers on competing cards like the r9
370 but at a price like this we're
likely sticking with 1080p gaming for
the foreseeable future
and at the price is that Nvidia partners
like EVGA are clearing to gig cards to
make room for the more expensive four
gig models I think I have to go with the
20% better raw GPU performance versus
AMD's offering for storage I am one of
and apparently one of the only ones on
the planet but I'm one of the people who
leans towards a hybrid or sshd Drive on
an entry level system Seagate's
ST 1000 DX 0 0 1 1 terabyte hard drive
with 8 gigs of mlc SSD cache gets my
choice here now compared to last year
system we saved $6.00 use the same case
got twice as many al biet slower CPU
cores opted to save a bit on storage by
skipping the boot SSD but we turned that
savings and our RAM savings into nearly
double the graphics horsepower by
reallocating that budget to the GPU so
I'm confident that in modern games this
year's model is anywhere from 70 to 80 %
faster than the one from last year's
buyers guide for our next system future
expandability features and usability
beyond gaming are much bigger
considerations it's for this reason that
we decided to kick things up a notch
with an Intel quad core not one of those
fancy skylake ones that are so hard to
get your hands on but a last generation
has well based Core i5 4460 I mean sure
you lose out on the better onboard
graphics and the lower power consumption
and it doesn't have hyper threading but
it's still a quad core that boosts to
three point 4 gigahertz and we get to
save a few bucks on our motherboard and
RAM since we're using a last generation
16 gig kit of g.skill ripjaws X ddr3 on
an MSI b85 g-41 note that I actually
went with MSI's non-gaming branded b85
board in this price range to get
something with four dimm slots and
dedicated ports for all audio channels
and to avoid a killer network card my
personal experience with them is that
the extra features they offer
are a trade-off against just plain
working all the time so I don't want to
pay extra for one of those for our power
supply we ended up with an EVGA B 500
watt a much better not to mention 80
plus bronze unit for only seven dollars
more than the CX 430 we went with last
year thanks EVGA for that our case
choice once again didn't change much and
we went with the NZXT source 210 it
really is a great value case there's not
really much else to say about it and the
GTX 970 rears it's three and a half
gigabyte head once again coming in at
290 dollars so about 10% cheaper than
last year for the same performance
although it should be noted that an r9
390 is a slightly faster option at a
higher price if you bat for the red team
storage was a bit of a toss-up for me
for this one a 960 gig value SSD like an
OCC tree on 100 goes for pretty much the
same price to the dollar as a 500 gig
samsung 850 Evo and a 4 terabyte Seagate
hard drive and while both are valid
options I eventually decided that
because this is a desktop it's more
likely to act as a file repository for
other devices in the household if you
don't have an ass and the the one to
solid state mechanical punch is my best
bet a DVD writer also made it into the
thousand dollar machine just in case you
need one so compared to last year's
model then we spent the same amount
almost to the dollar and and well gaming
performance actually didn't change more
than probably 10 to 15 percent in CPU
limited titles what we did get though
for our money was a much faster CPU for
multi-threaded workloads like light
content creation a much better power
supply and twice the solid-state storage
on our boot drive meaning that fewer
games will need to be relegated to
living on the hard drive not to mention
that we also jumped from 3 terabytes of
hard drive space to 4 for our last
system we are assuming that the buyer is
one who cares about getting a longer
life out of his or her system is one
that wants the utmost in performance and
is willing to pay a bit more for it and
is potentially a computer performance
enthusiast
side of gaming whether that's content
creation or some other demanding
workload so the cpu choice was a fairly
obvious one I didn't want to pay as much
for a CPU as I did for our entire entry
level gaming machine so the 59 30k with
it six processing cores and forty PCI
Express Lanes was out of the question
but fortunately this generation the
step-down 5820k is still unlocked for
easy overclocking and has the same six
physical cores with hyper-threading
technology so the only thing missing is
12 of those PCI Express Lanes which
won't matter much unless you're trying
to run more than a few high bandwidth
PCIe devices and some CPU clock speed
which are knocked to a Nhu 14s CPU
cooler and a few minutes of tinkering in
the BIOS with the help of this easy
overclocking guide will easily take care
of 4 ram ddr4 is the only choice on the
x99 platform so I went with 32 gigs of
Corsair Vengeance lpx quad-channel
memory at 21 33 megahertz it's not
setting any speed records but since
we're locking ourselves in to up to 64
gigs of ram in the future unless we want
to pull that out and replace it I don't
think we'll be running a crap ton of
virtual machines on this PC in the
future anyway and that speed especially
running in quad-channel should be enough
for the motherboard I opted to pay the
$50 Asus tax in this case and got the
x99 a USB 3.1 it lacks some of the bells
and whistles of the deluxe model that we
use here at the office like high-speed
AC wireless but it's got the same
overclocking capabilities SLI and
crossfire support for multiple graphics
cards and USB 3.1 10 gigabit is a nice
touch I also like the color scheme and
that it goes nicely with our Corsair our
MX 750 watt power supply and air 540
white Edition case I know it's shallow
and I just spent a little more than I
had to on those components but past a
certain point case selection in
particular is less about fitting the
hardware inside it and more about
personal taste and if we're going to be
spending this much it doesn't hurt to
have a rocking black and white theme
going to the build that especially
combined with our msi gtx 980ti
is going to look absolutely
the Sikh tastic so on that subject then
I opted for a single graphics card this
year because I realized that while my
dual 970 setup last year would perform
very well likely better in many cases
than a single 980ti where sli scaling
and the smaller video frame buffer
aren't issues it still meant occasional
sli compatibility woes and it completely
lacked a sensible upgrade path something
that I can see folks spending 2 G's on
their pcs wanting so that single more
powerful graphics card provides that
upgrade path and that hassle-free
operation with the option to go sli down
the road if you really feel like it
although if you see that in your future
I would recommend an 850 watt power
supply versus the 750 in our base config
for storage I really think people
spending this much on a desktop should
also have an ass in their house for
redundant network storage and backups so
a single one terabyte class SSD should
be plenty but just in case I put
together two options here a 960 gig OCZ
vector 180 or a samsung 850 Pro lb at a
lower capacity with that same Seagate 4
terabyte drive from the last config this
machine also by the way gets an optical
drive so although it could be easily
remedied by going dual 970 s again our
top tier config is the only one that
actually gets slightly degraded gaming
performance for 2015 I also stepped down
the hard drive from 6 terabytes in size
again anyone keeping that much data on a
single drive in their computer needs to
re-evaluate his or her strategy but the
machine also got a few very significant
upgrades it'll look awesome be nearly
silent and I doubled my solid-state
storage to one terabyte more than most
people will need for a while I stepped
from 4 non hyper-threaded CPU cores to 6
with hyper-threading and I doubled my
system memory that's going to make this
machine a freaking beast capable of
performing better in content creation
tasks if using all of its horses or just
as well as last year's model in general
tasks if its resources are being split
by running v ends in the background
maybe something like this on raid setup
that we showed a little while ago where
Nazz operating system and a gaming
machine running Windows are both running
off of the same hardware so that then
concludes this year's holiday PC buyer's
guide I hope you guys enjoyed it and
remember that these selections are not
hard and fast rules they're just
guidelines this year for example I
didn't assume except at the very high
end that the user would be overclocking
so your best cooling and motherboard
choices might be a little different if
you plan to do that and this is really
important for commodity items like RAM
and video cards my component choices are
not set in stone in my shopping
methodology is pretty much as simple as
sorting by lowest price and scrolling
until I find a brand that I trust so
feel free to mix and match these things
to get the best deals from wherever you
end up buying your new system although
on that note if you decide to use this
guide I'd love it if you shopped using
the Amazon or NCIX links in the video
description we don't get any sponsorship
money from PC hardware vendors for doing
these buyers guides because that would
be a huge conflict of interest but using
our affiliate links is a way that you
guys can support us directly regardless
of whose parts you end up buying
speaking of regardless of what parts you
end up buying you'll probably need a
place to put them all and updesk has got
you covered there with a wide range of
powered standing desks available on
updesk dot-com what almost all of them
have in common is the high quality dual
motor electronically controlled height
adjust system that lets you either
manually raise or lower the desktop
surface or pre-programmed three
different heights for sit-stand and okay
actually don't know what the third one
is for but it's there so so whatevs
the one that I've been using ever since
up desk equipped our office is the large
size powerup a fairly standard gently
curved on one side affair but the
benchmarking room is set up with a
couple of there squared up l-shaped
corner desks to allow Luke and John to
work on a couple of things at once and
they've got some other really cool
options as well like the upright that
has a dry erase board for the surface on
the top so whether you're just trying to
get in the habit of shifting positions
periodically throughout the day or you
want to get some real
health benefits out of your new desk by
putting a treadmill under it check out
op desk over at my up desk dot-com

thanks for watching guys if you like
this video do that thing if you just
liked it do the other thing and wait if
you liked it back to liking it again get
