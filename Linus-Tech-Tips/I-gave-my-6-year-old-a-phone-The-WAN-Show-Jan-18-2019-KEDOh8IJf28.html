super super weird and I hope that's not
echoing there's a problem there's one
minor problem there's a minor problem
those headphones I don't know where to
unplug them ah they're like pretty low
you hear that yeah I hear it hopefully
the audience can't are we live is it are
we live right now yeah it's when
Showtime yeah actually the video I was
working on just now sounded super cool
really cool so um have you seen that
that like what is it like ten year
challenge hashtag or something
oh yeah I just phone Oh for that that's
hilarious right I'm close to 2009 2019
so we did one but like not not my old
facebook pictures or anything because I
don't post on Facebook but LTT okay
because l 2009 versus 2019 yeah so LT t
actually just celebrated its 10-year
anniversary and then the funny thing
about that you're right that is really
loud yeah okay like we gotta unplug them
so l TT actually celebrated its 10-year
anniversary not that long ago so it's
effectively a look at the entire history
of the channel yeah because the only
things that were posted in 2008
honestly were not what L CT would be
over the next three years okay so I
don't know if you know this but at the
time I was working with Keaton who was a
writer slashed the video guy for
hardware canucks okay so a lot of
hardware connects viewers probably won't
remember this but fixed e or fixed was
the the both the video personality and
the shooter and editor for hardware
connects videos for some time before
dimitri came onto the scene yeah
so he was shooting for you so so the
original idea with Linus tech tips was
that it was gonna be like a lower
production value thing but Keaton who I
am quite certain is not watching this so
yeah
I don't have to worry about I don't have
to worry about here but Keaton had sort
of uh I don't know if you'd call it a
disorder or a compulsion or thank you I
don't know what you'd call it but he
just couldn't let anything be so he's
just good enough so the original idea
behind Linus tech tips was that it was
supposed to be like the cheapo
run-and-gun as fast as you can get it
out as fast as you can pump a mouse
thing like my quota was 45 videos a
month on top of light I had a real job
on top of the four to six NCIX tech tips
I remember one of my favorite things was
it was super important when I pressed
record and when I press stop record
because we were not gonna edit it so
like if I if I didn't if I if there was
a huge delay between me pressing
recording you starting to talk it was
awkward and if I'd let it run for too
long after you stopped talking to his
awkward so that was like we've run into
trouble sometimes we're like Luke would
think I was done and I would think I was
done but then I'd be like oh except for
one and laughs sorry I depress record
let me be like okay so Keaton couldn't
do that so so the first couple of line
is tech tips videos actually from like
an an effort standpoint anyway we're
quite a bit higher production values
okay like the first one has a laugh
track so like there's actual editing in
it I don't know if I've seen the first -
tech tips video I nursing the first NCI
executives video oh yeah
the first line is probably do I talk to
our AMD rep into allowing us to do a
pre-release video I've seen that of an
undisclosed processor and he was like
well you can't leak any useful
information about it so the only thing I
was essentially able to say was I have
it but there's actual electrical tape on
the screen to ensure that no you know
you know how okay you know how if you
have like an image and you like scribble
over it you know you can come in
scribbling
is a guy who swirled this face in the
FBI us world it yeah like yeah zero
every okay
electrical tape stuck to the screen
could not see what was under it yeah but
it was just like oh there's a processor
and then the second one was like the
idea was there of it being like cheapo
unboxings that were just these very
brief looks at a product where it was an
unboxing of a rampage three extreme
webpage like really hold tortoise
I'm page two extreme I don't know it
doesn't matter the point is it was it
was a rampage board and it had this
goofy little like knob on it that was
supposed to be like an OC knob - OC up
or down so like a shifter so the
beginning of the video starts with me
holding the driver just like this I like
pretending to drive it
I liked that kitchen Asst I know I know
it wasn't good but like it was bad I I
found it entertaining the best part of
like people complaining about yeah the
sex jokes or the dad humor or the cringe
or whatever else I remember when Linus
detectives didn't have any of this stuff
like oh okay no what are you watching
this
clearly my electives it was terrible
literally in the first 10 seconds of the
first video ever uploaded to the channel
there's a laugh track
okay that's brutal I turn around in my
chair
basically like uh-oh didn't see you
there a moment and I bumped the table
and a laugh track goes off and I'm like
Oh in the first 10 seconds i guess i
100% have seen this video but i just
don't remember that I remember you
hitting the table but I don't remember
the laugh track my brain just like
edited that out it's like no you're not
allowed to no no bad it can't happen you
know what there's no love we don't
really have any good topics today though
has cult we did the land show dot it's
just watchful we're just gonna we're
gonna watch this video I mean I mean
that's what twitch streamers do these
days anyways there's gonna be a lot more
insight in the in the like 2009 to 2019
video you know what's really what was a
really cool thing about that video I'm
pretty sure I can talk about this now
like I don't think there's an
the a or anything but it's sponsored by
P and H oh cool yeah yeah so like oh boy
so like half the content in that video
is gonna be like yeah cuz that's the
point that's the point they knew what
they response okay we have a point she
was scratched lands okay like it was and
I was doing that Co nation is bad so um
no no they they know it's all good so
like part of the cool thing about going
through this progression is that where
we started out compared to like BH
wanting to work with us
oh it's like a ten year change in terms
of like the both the business side and
the production values the fact that B
and H will even pick up the phone to
talk of us lead they wouldn't have know
we're still trying to just like you know
run around with a cell phone hey what's
this fire truck oh I hate that that
video is still the top viewed video on
the panel what's it at now it's over 10
million oh all right so so this visit I
don't actually know if you guys are
gonna have audio capture from my
computer so good luck everybody else I
also don't even know if this is gonna
work yeah and test it yeah that's that's
the intro yeah how do you like that four
by three aspect ratio there baby
also it was only a minute twenty see I
remember that I very clearly remember
that but I still don't remember the
laugh track I'm actually kind of happy I
can't hear is this what YouTube does to
4x3 videos now just make it like weird
and squish letter and pillar boxed
that's pretty weird okay so we showed it
running at 3.6 gigahertz honestly though
this one's not as cringy I don't know if
they have audio mic cliping
something something where's the sound is
there no sound Oh apparently the sound
is too low
Luke's ducky vid was great it is but
it's not going to be in that 2009 2019
thing because that was not technically a
Linus tech tips video
that was when I was like still planning
on doing my own thing okay he's happy I
didn't do that that would have been a
disaster I don't know that that video
seemed pretty good oh yeah yeah I mean
for the time it seems pretty legit I'll
be boat par I mean considering how bad
like my stuff was at that time like
everything was kind of bad back then
yeah everything was terrible sorry I'm
just loading up floatplane stream so I
can see comments from these got a title
and here's wrong because you weren't
logged in oh yeah
dang it yep sorry everyone all right
apparently you're too close to the mic
yeah but I can't really like like did
someone come in here and like make
changes to this or something okay
apparently the audio it wasn't why why
do people make changes I specifically
said on my way out from lunch yes I know
it's kind of too quiet don't make any
changes are you just moving it away yeah
okay I'm probably gonna be too loud
regardless but your Toula yeah no I've
got people saying audio is clipping like
just audio is clipping so that's a big
actual problem and that's very
frustrating because this is why this is
why I say these things there's too many
dials I don't know all the dials we just
have way too much like the fact that
we're running a singular mic and we have
all this junk is ridiculous my streams
audio always sounds significantly better
and I just have one mixer yeah like I
don't I don't it shouldn't be this hard
I don't know the frustrating thing is
everyone in chat in flow plane though is
saying that the stream looks amazing so
heck yeah there we go oh good yeah we
have that yeah so we're just said turn
all the dials if we just randomize
everything it might end up better
alright well I'm just I'm just gonna be
relatively quiet and I'm gonna hope for
the best
okay we do we do have technically a land
show document this week do we not there
are
there are news I know it's I just got
signed out but Intel discontinues core
plus octane processors wow that was that
was not gonna eventually happen for sure
the mother of all breaches exposes 773
million emails and 21 million passwords
Facebook is apparently secretly building
lol a meme hub isn't Facebook already a
meme hub but this is the thing that kind
of blows my mind
it's like Facebook's like yeah we need
to purchase whatsapp to get into the
like like messaging private messaging
game but then but then Facebook message
is your thing and like apparently people
use like Instagram as their social
network now yep can I help you you wanna
are you the one who adjusted this who
touched it I'm trying to not throw
people under busses can you can you find
who touched it maybe that would probably
be really good I just yeah the problem
is that then you're gonna end up
adjusting the compressor and it's really
better not to touch the compressor okay
fine then do whatever you want I know
how they work too but that doesn't
change the honestly I don't even think
that one works properly like I think all
of that just needs to go in the garbage
and you just need one good yeah well the
issue is that two weeks ago Jake added a
preamp with the goal of making the audio
quality better and then that was when
people started complaining the show was
too quiet and then he went on vacation
and then called in sick today so he's
not here to fix his stupid preamp and
he's the one who put it in and the way
it's hooked up is complicated and so
someone else came in and tried to fix it
and they did
this is the best watch oh there's also
just doing this is that better hold on
stop Alex I'm just gonna turn it down in
a in OBS no no stop stop stop don't lose
everything clipping on here stairs but
it seems to be getting better so just
keep okay alright well hopefully it's
getting better you guys are witnessing
real time real time editing of things
now we're a bit too quiet
oh wow you know I just I give ya I give
up no way I'm show today I'm done I'm
done uh people say it's fine now so just
don't touch it
you're still touching it you're still
touching it we're just we're just gonna
go with what we have I don't even care
all right Karen it's it's Trevor s says
at least it's not ear rape leave it
print help oh boy
okay all right okay okay don't spam
please all right so why don't we jump
into our core plus opt-in processor so
you guys the original article here is
from kick guru and I don't know where
Colton got all these news items but it's
obviously not the forum because he's not
crediting people on the forum and it
doesn't look like he's looking at the
tech linked items for this week so
there's there's a spot actually on the
win show dock for both items that make
it into tech linked and ones that are
sort of notable but don't make it a
detect linked okay so I just like I just
don't even know know what he was doing
but anyway this is over on kit guru and
do you remember core plus vaguely do you
know what it is no I remember the
branding I don't really remember care so
core plus was a brand that from my
understanding was mostly intended to
only really exist on mobile but then
what's interesting here is that it
appears as though there were actual
desktop processors including an eighty
seven hundred eighty four hundred and a
quarter
that also had it and the idea was that
the processor was bundled with obtain
memory so its core in that the processor
is just a regular old core processor
core processor okay I seven I five or
whatever yeah and then it was plus
because it because it came with opting
now to be clear I'm not I'm not down on
obtain very cool technology I've been a
proponent of SSD caching sand
it first showed up in Intel's product
stack with what rst I believe there were
solutions before that in fact Wow
thinking back it really has been a very
long time OC said how to drive that I
think they called this in apps ah
synapse Drive does that sound right ocz
synapse yeah is that is that right yeah
okay so they had a caching drive that
came with like this weird third-party
software and it was designed with twice
the spare area so it was like it had
half the accessible capacity that was
actually on the drive and then the idea
was that it could easily sustain high
performance over time because this was
back before I think this is before trim
even existed so it could run garbage
collection because it had so much spare
area and it would last for longer
because it had more spare area and you
had to install this software and I don't
even remember if it worked on a boot
volume like it might have just been
something that you can do on like a
storage volume I don't even remember the
details it didn't it didn't sell well
because it's like super expensive anyway
Intel moved it more mainstream with rst
or a Rapid Storage Technology and I've
been a proponent of it ever since
because I think it's a great way to get
better performance out of magnetic
storage whether it's for your boot drive
or whether it's just for your game drive
like we actually did one recently where
we compared we ran obtained on AMD which
was kind of cool but using third-party
software that has come a long way in the
last ten years and actually worked
really really well like better than
AMD's first party solution store am i
sorry one quick thing yeah and I do that
thing again because there's a lot of
questions in here which thing the stream
thing it's a dream thing okay so I'm
getting a redonk amount of quite
probably more than I have any other week
which is kind of surprising but if
there's people that have questions about
flow plane that are fully members or not
come to my stream after the stream and
asked me then because I have to partake
in the win show yeah and is important
yeah yeah core plus yeah so no it's one
random little thing I want to add I
still have that synapse drive do you
really yeah the 30 gig one Wow yeah why
I just
I don't know you should use it as a
cache I mean it'd be slow as hell it's a
2 - isn't it yeah yeah I think so it's
really old yeah cuz that's isn't that
like priests and force that's that my
careless because I remember you gave it
to me when I used to live there ha and
then I guess I stopped using it so it's
like still there was it one of those
like I never want to see this again
things or no I used something to deserve
it I think it was I don't want to deal
with this ok yeah I think that was it so
anyway long story short I'm cool with
caching I think it's great however yeah
the branding behind like that core plus
branding is terrible I honestly the
branding and the marketing around almost
everything that touches obtained has
been really rough there's a lot of
things that they could have done to just
make it yeah just make it better and
easier to understand like locking it
down less and like I don't know anyway
will be funky octane is cool this
solution selling it bundled with a
processor is super dumb they should just
sell it as a processor and an obtain
module yeah you'd even sell it as like a
bundle just say that not core plus yeah
cuz core plus sounds like like it like a
case Q style thing yeah you know what I
mean or it sounds like it has more
course yeah sure yeah you know again
everything's got like a 10-year theme I
think it was like 11 12 years ago that
intel released their core series
processors I'm still mad it's so stupid
why do I have to say core i7 quad core
processor why do I have to say core
twice it's so dumb I actually liked the
i7 I 5x3 thing when it first came out
really when it first came out and I
justify it no I'm listening
it helped categorize things for me when
I was trying to do explain things to
other people and I know I know actually
proper defining lines between the
categories categories have always been
really weird
but in general most things kind of line
up pretty well do they I don't
necessarily want to follow this story
but like if I was if someone was like
what's the difference if someone who
knew basically nothing was like what's
the difference between high 17 high
fives with Sandy Bridge what would you
say I would say go watch this excellent
video over on the channel taken by the
Sandy Bridge so pre techie okay I could
tweet a quickie I talked to I would say
a core i7 is maybe gonna have more
memory channels okay but although they
don't know anything they don't know what
memory channel I'm talking total layman
I worked it best buy it this time I'm
selling laptops okay I would say and
like core i7 might have onboard video
but might not it's a laptop a laptop
well there were desktop ones yes there
some of them were triple channel memory
some of them were dual some of them were
architectural II a generation ahead of
the other ones that were on the high-end
platform we sought we sold like a
desktop a week laptops were selling like
this so what your experience inside Best
Buy is all that matters and no I was
saying it was useful to me at that time
okay but couldn't they just as easily I
didn't say it was good okay I didn't say
it was good couldn't easily gone okay
gold silver bronze yep the gold one the
gold - yep the gold - ah they could have
I'm not saying I don't I'm not saying it
was good not that I'm saying that's good
either what they've done with the Zeon's
gold silver brought it's terrible it's
terrible scenario so also really big
yeah I just in general it was helpful to
be like that one has this stuff extra
there you go
it has hyper-threading yeah that's the
answer you where we wanted from me is
yes and you avoided it the whole time
but that's that's all I needed to say to
most people and okay what's
hyper-threading Wow but it was still
sort of helpful but the core part
actually frustrated me more yeah I was
stupid
yeah the iSeries has its own huge swath
of problems you know that's the really
dumb thing to it's like I actually
because I'm not really an auto person I
actually blamed Intel for this crap it's
BMW three five and seven series
oh my god it's all BMWs fault
see I'm a computer person I thought it
was the other way around no that makes
as if BMW would copy intel cementing you
know the crazy thing is until used to
have like respectable branding to do to
do yeah like until inside people used to
like there was kids at my school who
were not into computers who had Intel
Inside shirts cuz like it was a thing
and the old int onside commercials were
like very memorable until inside was
huge
yep and you you still remember the
jingle and like there's there even other
stuff that I thought they did really
well Centrino I thought was a stroke of
marketing excellence maybe not genius
but definitely excellence because what
it did was it achieved a sales goal so
it incentivized laptop manufacturers to
buy not just the CPU and chipset but
also the Wi-Fi module from Intel it
improved the state of wireless
technology for consumers in general
because all of a sudden it made it easy
to buy decent Wi-Fi over craptastic
Wi-Fi that just like basically wasn't
gonna work it had until networking it
had a battery life message behind it
because it had to include their Benyus
core core M processor
[Laughter]
and so it had like it had this strong
technology and sort of quality of life
and also sales kind of message so I like
I had to respect it as as sort of
excellent marketing yeah a well crafted
message yeah but it just it feels like
they're just struggling and I have to
wonder if maybe part of the problem is
that they just don't really have
anything new to sell more Korres doesn't
okay so what like AMD is like we
actually don't know what to do with all
these cores it's all inside well am be
outside there's got two records to fit
inside it should steep that should be
their branding okay I can't carry all
these course
yeah but CPU so efficient you can go buy
a pickup truck and kill the environment
with it if you buy your cores in the bed
drive around just drive around to work
commuting in that pickup truck you got
all your core isn't it I just want the
most Texan personified to do this video
I specifically make sure that they have
no idea what a core is is have them be
like super into it won't even be helpful
anyways the outside I don't think them
not having something new to sell
justifies butchering all their branding
yeah because they if they kept up from
that I know I was I was crushed when
Squarespace change their branding back
in the day from build a beautiful or
whatever the other one was because there
was two that I really liked oh man
you and I played off this make it crazy
make it something I think and I would
always jump in and say the word Oh what
it was I don't remember
wow I don't remember yeah maybe it
wasn't that good oh well okay they
dropped it pretty quick cuz they used to
switch branding yes super fast you
should yeah
[Laughter]
you should go view that was amazing so
like thank you they change the branding
way too fast and I don't know I've never
actually thought that was that great of
an idea especially if you find one that
gloms on really well yeah and like maybe
you should only calm down with our audio
were just like yeah maybe but Intel
Inside was very Universal and that was
all you have to update stuff and I have
to confess I didn't like their newer
logo until I like went back the other
day I could see some updating the logo
though but I would keep my Intel Inside
Intel side was huge do they still use it
at all like I think they definitely
still protect the trademark I'm sure but
like yeah trademarks Intel insides brand
logo mark name on my network this is
relatively new branding ish yeah okay so
they still put inside on stuff but it's
not doesn't have the same kind of punch
here's a sample usage chart I mean maybe
they just don't emphasize it the way
that they used to yeah amazing I always
get such a kick out of this I remember
we we worked with well I guess it'll
never happen again because I'm talking
about this now but we worked with the
IOC at one point oh and the guidelines
they have for this kind of stuff are
just like they're actually crazy yeah
look at this amazing things start with
Intel Inside is correct amazing things
start with Intel inside your PC like
look for Intel Inside okay oh it's got
this I think I was gonna say I think
that's the problem with that one too I
don't think it's the PC
I think it's that Intel's the trademark
is on Intel I don't know whatever
they're not they're not
oh shoot did we have an echo in the
backlogs doing that oh my bad I'm sorry
you guys they probably did crap oh well
welcome to flow plain UNIX night yeah
well welcome to the land show everyone
we just complained about into a brothel
yeah every week do we even have a show
today is this even a show is anyone
gonna watch this yeah yeah 7500 people
watch into YouTube yeah it officially
doesn't matter anymore
let's saw actually we should probably do
our sponsor spots holy crap we started
so late today
oh yeah spectrum yeah uh-oh hey new
packaging I want the vector is this the
oh there's a dress there's a clip-on
you don't have glasses though so you
don't get the clip-on oh this is the
blue light blocking oh these look nice
glasses yeah these look actually quite a
bit better almost all your driving
decisions are based on what you see
spectrums new lumen driving glasses with
the L um to ten lens claim to make it
easier to see road marks stop signs
street lights and more to help reduce
your risks on the road this is actually
something that is pretty like well-known
using a like a yellow tinted lens while
you're driving is supposed to increase
visibility they also block a hundred
percent of UVA and UVB rays and if
you're unsatisfied with your lumen
glasses within 30 days they'll give you
a full refund no questions asked so go
to and shoten ah use when shoten on
their Amazon listing oh we have a coupon
to just buy the one Amazon that's kind
of crazy I get 10% off your order at LM
GG g / looming LM dijon LM g g g / lumen
how do these look are they a little wide
for my face uh I'm really bad at that
I think barely but like maybe not I feel
like if I had trendier hair I could
actually rock these but my hair is so
bad that was actually another thing that
was kind of fun for the 10 year thing
like looking at your hair through the
ages and the great thing about it is
that there was just like not really a
clear improvement no oh no there's
periods of like truly spectacular ly
awful there's dips but there's not
really anything better it's like I have
such unpopular opinions about certain
things about you I don't find your voice
annoying I've never seen your hair is a
notable problem oh it's a problem I know
a parent yeah oh it's like I'm just bad
it's objectively a big problem I don't
see you know who else's sponsor today
humblebundle heck ya find great deals on
amazing games books comics and more at
Humble Bundle they believe you should
pay for what you want and they even give
you the ability to decide how you want
to divide your payment between the
creator's charity and even to Humble
Bundle themselves you can either
purchase specific titles at their store
or through their bundle sets and they
have monthly bundles as a subscription
service so find out what you could get
this month through our partner link LM
GG g / humble bundle that's pretty cool
i've used humbled by the lots of times
me too I've bought a lot of games I
never played
yeah but I've also got some games that I
did play yeah and I didn't pay very much
and it was probably like cheaper as a
whole anyways yes now is the beauty of
Humble Bundle but they have this like a
normal store now - which is pretty cool
yeah technically there's a private
Internet access spot in here
get private Internet access I don't have
a lot of time you would show is gonna be
we've got a better link than that what
is it LM g ja GG / dia when yeah LM GG g
/ p IA when we gotta get those things
updated yeah oh you know what else I
really really have to update you guys on
okay so we've got a couple of updates we
actually forgot last week to look at the
blog oh so there's a couple updates
posted by Stephanie Potter ways to get
to LTX 2019 Xtreme hack lots of options
if you're flying into Vancouver the
closest airport is Vancouver
International Airport YVR it's in
Richmond don't worry it doesn't matter
if you plan on staying in Richmond or
downtown Vancouver there's a great there
are great public transit options it's
called the sky train so there's three
lines that branch out from actually very
close to where LTX is if you are
anywhere not on the sky train our public
transit sucks and we don't have Ober so
I would strongly recommend finding a
hotel that is near a sliding station so
the Waterfront station is about five
minutes from the Vancouver Convention
Center walking and pretty much
everything can get to waterfront if you
live locally or plan on renting a car
there's ample parking located under the
East Building of the Vancouver
Convention Center road-tripping to the
great white north if you're taking i-5
up from CF from Seattle you'll cross
into Canada
gee Sarge border-crossing which is open
24 hours these are actually really great
tips you guys are gonna wanna go check
these out over at LTX Expo comm and
we've got some information about hotel
accommodation and options um yeah we
don't have lyft or uber week I cannot
make that clear enough we do not have
ride share here because the taxicab
mafia is still somehow winning it's it's
unbelievable Mexico and taxicabs are
kind of garbage here too yeah if you
stay in downtown Vancouver it's roughly
a 20 to 30 minute walk max
and then there's always taxis or public
transit as options it's a decent City to
walk through though um so there's some
four and a half five star for 600 to 800
a night that's pretty expensive if the
rest of downtown is a bit of a mixed bag
ranging from 80 bucks a night for
hostels to hotels in the 300 dollar
range and if you're looking at Airbnb
zs-- there's options from single rooms
to full apartments in the 125 to 350
range if you don't mind traveling more
or you want to rent a car cuz you're
gonna run around and see the city like I
know Steve from gamers Nexus ended up
going up to Whistler and doing some
biking and stuff since he was in town
anyway
um you can stay outside of the downtown
core and it's quite a bit less expensive
so like hostels as low as like 50 bucks
a night so uh yeah that's pretty cool
what Colton it's gonna be it's gonna be
sick
these are from spectrum they're they're
driving glasses oh they're actually
they're actually like tinted kind of
like differently than their regular just
like blue light filters this isn't
during the sponsor spot anymore so I'm
gonna I'm gonna go into it the style of
them reminds me very strongly of destiny
skins really yeah they're like gold with
the carbon fiber and then other matte
black this is a really sporty very
destiny skin style this almost looks
like like an impact resistant like
sports goggles to me yeah this one
doesn't this one's more like like
stylish like I could actually like I
could actually see myself like just
wearing this when I'm I could see you
doing something active you could see me
wearing them yeah you mean literally
yeah thanks Lou no no
[Laughter]
we have news in other news the oh really
was there news in the first place Lenovo
might be releasing their folding phone
yeah the Razr name oh that's great
seriously oh they gotta have like all
the colors again like chocolate so it
might be making a comeback as a $1,500
foldable phone according to the verge
will remember the razor wasn't cheap
that's true
but like like wow there was nothing
amazing about it though like calm down
you know I don't think it's gonna get
any better so here's the thing I think
it was for the first time last year
global phone unit sales dipped well like
they still have executives to pay you
know ya know I'm I just gotta go I can
CLE they do so we don't know anything
about this thing no screen size no specs
no yeah really anything we just know
that it's not the phone in the picture
that's yeah no that's the original
Motorola RAZR yeah um so I was hands-on
with a foldable phone down at CES
did you happen to see that video no but
I've seen many photos of that phone he's
terrible yeah I kind of assume yeah I
was like it was one of those things
where it was kind of like the ya know
quit okay so a question is it terrible
as in this will always suck or is it
terrible as in like wow this is a really
really rough year zero but I see the
future
it was terrible in that it was it's a
really rough year zero but I see the
future but they are going to suck for a
while yeah okay cuz here's nothing I
know what I was thinking you think think
back to how long it took laptop
manufacturers to figure out palm
rejection on the touchpad I'm like not
having a VCR inside which is a
relatively simple problem yeah
it's very horrible compared to like a
dual sided foldable device where you are
at times going to be touching the other
folded side of the display in the course
of your regular operation of it like
this is not simple and it's gonna look
stupid if it's not if it doesn't you
know have stuff on the back like it's
not gonna look cool and space-age it's
not gonna work for marketing purposes
unless they try to keep the whole
display on the whole time so so there's
there's the whole touch rejection thing
to get over there's the fact that if
that display is anything to go by the
quality of the OLED panels themselves
might be trash now it was it was bad
like I honestly that booth was one of
those ones where I wanted to be as nice
to them as I could because I was right
up in their grills while I'm talking
about this product yeah but I also tried
to get my point across that like even
though this product is for sale like
don't buy it it's got some issues some
issues yeah as they say the other one
that was like that was the the VR shoes
that I saw while I was down there do you
see that video yes I'd liked them I know
but it's ed ed likes them until I told
him how much they cost how much they
cost guess okay so just okay so you
haven't seen the video there VR shoes
where you like go like this on the floor
or like backwards and you spin in your
chair and like you walk in this
direction and then you like spinning
your chair and you walk in this
direction but you stay seated the whole
time so my brain like rollerballs on the
bottom it it's effectively ball most
technology in 2019 on your feet it's not
quite ball Mouse technology because it's
only 2d so it's more like scroll wheel
technology scroll carry on it's even not
as advanced as ball most technology in
2019 so it should cost like like 50
bucks a foot but I'm going to guess it's
like three
hundred three hundred fifty bucks for
the set and at that price would you
consider it to be something worth buying
no and if you liked it
no it's four hundred dollars oh oh okay
oh the main reason why I would say no I
wouldn't find it because it's gonna be
good in such a select amount of games
because so many games are not gonna
expect you to have that type of movement
Dhoom like they had there I'm very not
surprised they picked doom yeah because
it's probably pretty good and do but
like I can't imagine if you need to
travel for very long distances like if
you're in like oh yeah what a pain yeah
I have to run across this whole freaking
map just trying to like run in my chair
the whole damn time like that's I can't
imagine that would be good like it's one
of those it's one of those things where
it's like did joystick waggling with the
we ever displace traditional controllers
no because no one actually wants to do
that and if you're gonna if we're gonna
play an exercise game then I'm gonna
play an exercise game not uh like
shuffling my feet back and forth yeah
game like that's not an elite Sabre oh
sorry go ahead
I I also partially understand the cost
because they're gonna sell like four of
them more than that obviously I'm
exaggerating by a lot but like yeah if
it was just like two dudes or something
I'd be like yeah you guys can make her
go oh this hey you took a trackball
almost and you put it on people's feet
how do software work yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah in other news yeah in other news
the pi max isn't bad anymore oh really
yes that's actually surprising it's very
surprising cuz did you you never tried
it no but I listened to you I was really
frustrated because there were other like
I'm not gonna name any names
partly because I don't remember what
they are but I was getting thrown under
the bus because there were other like
much more credible VR enthusiast
youtubers who are focused on VRS that
were saying that
amazing sure and I was sort of the the
dissenting voice being like no actually
this is garbage like they cannot ship
this something something I've been sorry
I'm gonna kill ya something I've been
thinking about over the last little bit
it's like a lot of the vrq think you are
Linus you can interject your home point
a lot of the VR community a lot of the
hardcore VR community kind of hates us
because we're dissenters to a certain
degree right I think the problem is we
can't be their champion right well I
guess I sort of could now but it's also
not my space anymore but like Linus tech
tips can't be their champion his last
actives is technology review yes and
it's like early on and really rough and
like people that are buying them are not
using them and like etc etc etc so like
gotta keep credibility and be a proper
reviewer it's we can't yeah champion VR
I think we both would like to I want it
to be better than it is
I want it to do better than it has yeah
and we both wish it the best yes and are
both highly interested in it the thing
to is even in the time since VR became a
consumer product like with the with the
vibe I don't mean like there has been dr
consumer products before but yeah even
in that time - tech tips has also gotten
a lot more mainstream in terms of the
technology that it covers but also the
perspective that i am trying to provide
because like i've been i've had my eyes
has to be impartial it's not it can't
just be your view i've had my eyes kind
of opened to that there's so much more
to the world than technology enthusiasts
even within people who who love and live
in brief technology like of the top
interest of my twitter followers is dogs
not tech there you go tech is a very
close second but dogs is first of dogs
is first um i mean and here's the thing
like even i was watching the mkbhd
livestream today and he said he got rid
of the mast
that i hooked up for him in favor of
this jellyfish one because it was like
simpler and i was like okay
this is just something that you know was
hard for me to imagine ten years ago
yeah the theme of today's stream yeah it
was hard for me to imagine ten years ago
but like that even among people who are
technology lovers they're sort of this
there's this friction when it comes to
like working on technology it's like no
saying why the sensors don't work
physically note etcetera just like
there's there's people who would
consider themselves into cars but who
don't change their own oil yeah they
just like driving them so so anyway like
we've we've tried to take on and it's
not it's not always easy for me like
sometimes I'll end up nerding out over
like a header on a motherboard and like
I can I can feel the hundreds of
thousands or millions of eyeballs or
maybe not eyeballs but certainly
eyebrows just kind of going right what
but it's something that I've actively
tried to do and from a more mainstream
perspective VR is not very interesting
like I got I had Yvonne try beat Sabre
last night cuz I've been I've been
having a blast in it because really I
had her try it last night and she played
for seven minutes and was like yeah I'm
feeling a little sick I'm tired of
having something on my face and went
back to like browsing Facebook on her
phone and that's not because she likes a
voter's wasn't good at it or something
it's because VR just has like a really
long way to go and has some real actual
obstacles that I'm sorry will make it
not mainstream period like the fact that
you need all this space lots of people
don't have space yeah even if they did
have the money and so people will get
mad people will not like it but we got
to stand by the stuff my man we can't be
the champions for that I don't I don't
agree with a lot of the VR community's
defenses of VR I love it
I've actually I've been using I've been
using my vibe more than for LA so I've
been using actually quite a lot lately
I've been using
like at least every other night for this
I wouldn't punch my ceiling in beat
saber I would probably be using it all
the time as well that it's it's very
cool but we can't put our own opinions
too heavily into the wall okay again I
don't do this anymore but line
effectives can't put their own opinions
too heavily into this kind of stuff I
mean I can include it I just can't like
that can't be the conclusion of the room
you can't just be a champion for it yeah
just in spite of whatever is in front of
my face yeah um speaking of champion
beat saber not savor facebook fall
champion wait what is this this is not
the right there's not the right thing
Oh interesting apparently Facebook is
investing into news partnerships over
the next three years I guess they don't
want to elect to trump again huh that's
really interesting
Oh Oh speak oh there was like there was
like some like Mimi thing that I had one
Facebook lol it's a TechCrunch article
down I don't know I was looking for a
different thing now I'm over that one
okay uh-oh you know what I really want
to talk about sure forget it I don't
feel like talking about that okay um so
I hooked my yeah um the title of the
stream yeah yeah um I'd like to know
before I sort of explain why what's your
gut reaction he's six he's six to six um
I'm not I'm not a father I don't
Intendant being a father
mine does matter but I'm still judge
Internet it scares the heck out of me to
be completely honest so part of the big
part of the problem too is I feel like
when I was growing up the internet was a
little bit more divided
there was like porn sites and then there
was the rest of the internet it was a
little harder to find the porn sites it
was a little harder to find them and
like mainstream websites didn't
effectively have it all over the place
or at the very least extremely
sexualized content where it's like maybe
there isn't nudity but we all know why
you're here
that's everywhere now yep
and the rest there's tons of other stuff
internet that scares the hell out of me
too in terms of a very impressionable
small child that scares me
yeah if it was just a call and texting
plan situation mm-hm sounds like it may
be a good idea but the internet scares
feet that is a very interesting
perspective here's an alternate look so
my wife and I are Yvonne I guess most of
you know her name so we actually talked
about it a fair bit so one of the
reasons that okay sorry I want to throw
another job but there's other obviously
positive parts the internet as well he
could share location if for some reason
he's ever lost automatically
automatically believe it or not I can
just check his location right now
Oh see like that's cool yeah and like
it's like that kind of stuff is oh yeah
what's not yeah I'm not gonna show it
yeah I was just making sure sometimes
hey I'm sleek on-stream updated eleven
minutes ago that's exactly where he's
supposed to be right now yeah I'm like
that's awesome huge amount of peace of
mind like it's just so there's there's
the great part and there's the that's
scary kind of part but overall I don't
think it's a negative thing that you
give him a phone so I would not judge it
that way I was convinced that my kids
probably weren't gonna get a phone until
around the time that I did which was
when I turned 16 if I recall correctly
okay which admittedly was probably
pretty old fashioned like yeah when the
newsletter came home when he started
school like real school not preschool
when he started school and the
newsletter came home with like a cell
phone's policy I was like this
elementary school what do I need these
kids have cell phones for so the thing
that made me come around to just
approaching the idea and that sort of
opened up the discussion with the wife
was that I'm gonna start taking him with
me when I travel sometimes okay just so
that we get to spend a little bit more
time together when daddy's traveling
that's cool cuz did you travel a lot
that's cool yeah so I want to start
taking him with me and if for whatever
reason we got split up in an airport or
whatever I
don't want to have a phone like period
because there's like it's really funny
like if my phone battery is dead or
whatever else
iris must have been a couple months ago
I was running around the superstore
trying to find Yvonne in the kids cuz
they were shopping and I was doing a
thing that I used to do where I would
walk down the entire thing looking down
every aisle to figure out where they are
and you can still miss people because
they could be like in between aisles as
you pass through or whatever else and I
was like it has been so long since I've
done this because if I ever don't know
where Yvonne is and then I find out yeah
and so I was like okay just for the sake
of location I'd like to know where he is
sure also a really cool and interesting
side effect has been that I have ended
up talking to him more something about
text communication especially while I've
been traveling so he actually texts me
all the time okay that's cool and
without his own means of communicating
with me how was he supposed to do that
yeah and it's not like I don't still
talk to him in person
when we're in the same room but you know
if he's on his way to skating lessons or
something he'll just text me and be like
on my way to skating lessons gonna have
fun hope your days okay that's pretty
freakin cute oh jeez alright and it's
pretty it's pretty neat because you know
I can you know text back be safe and and
all that stuff let me know how it went
you know send me a picture of they were
working on this homegrown Crystal kit
thing well that was easy yes
like hey send me a picture of the
crystals and like it's really fun it's
interactive it's all the reasons that we
like text communication why it's
completely taken over the world
super wholesome um another thing is we
have put all of his relatives in his
home book so he's just like staying in
touch with his family in a way that I
just didn't do when I didn't have my own
couldn't way of communicating because
all that you had was the landline which
when I was a kid you shared with your
internet connection to we'd be playing
games
dude which was which was lame yeah no
games were cool but having them shared
yeah yeah um now in response to the
Internet I will say this because of who
he is specifically I'm not that worried
about it if I say don't go to any
website other than the websites that I
say hey I can whitelist sites like I can
actually go that draconian if I need to
but if I say don't go to any web sites
other than these ones he actually
wouldn't
now that might change as he gets older
he might get a little more defiant
little devious um but I mean there's
other stuff too there's actually no way
I tried to override it I cannot
there's no way to install a full YouTube
app on a Google kids account oh so he
cannot watch my videos this is what I
was gonna say those like even really
mainstream sites like YouTube there's
stuff on it that was like you know can't
get to YouTube okay yeah like the eyes
you bring twitches bundled in with that
well he can't install an app without it
pinyin me to improve it but it couldn't
you just go to the website like
YouTube's ah no I doubt it okay I can I
can I can I don't know anything about
the kids I can double-check that but I'm
not that worried about that I think it's
very unlikely the other thing too is I
get a report of what apps he's in what
is web browsing history is how long he's
been in ReactOS meantime I can do it day
by day so he's spending some time in
whatsapp and apparently someone let him
watch Netflix today for half an hour I
can just like lock it I can just lock
him out of it I can set the hours of day
that he's allowed to access it and I
don't know it's it's one of those things
where it's actually been really cool to
see him learning how to communicate
digitally because there's stuff that
there's like texting etiquette things
that I kind of take for granted like
it's adorable he feels like he has to
reply to every message you remember that
yeah okay cool
I was I was someone brought up a
runescape the other day and I brought up
that I used to have such a hard
time playing my game because the first
MMO style game I played and every single
time I walk past anyone all
communication then was speech bubble
above your head yes so every single
speech bubble I saw ah I thought they're
talking to me so I would like walk up to
two random people having conversation to
start replying out of nowhere I was like
that versus how insufferable by gamers
hate kids so much yeah pretty much
for me I'm like but then like I remember
what a little like okay so Diablo 1 not
realizing that there was no godly plate
of the whale that was purely at Reynard
item I tried to convince someone that
mine was legit at some point and they're
just like look the server says no
trainers no hackers get out of here I'm
like no no this is real it's mine it's
mine there was that was not a real item
like so dumb anyway so I did it I'm
really happy that it's been a positive
experience because to me that would be a
pretty scary thing yeah that's cool I
intend to keep an eye on it
I don't think he's even opened a web
browser yet it hasn't even occurred to
him he mostly just uses it too oh no I
know when he watched Netflix he watched
it this morning before school because I
didn't feel like getting up yet that was
my bed he mostly uses it to whatsapp his
relatives which i think is pretty good
so seems pretty wholesome yeah yeah um
so I think that's pretty much it for
when show we'll see you guys again next
week same bat-time same bat-channel
that was a wild show and yeah like we
can play the insurance oh wow we didn't
you know what let's do it now outro
oh wait wait oh we should really do some
super chats hey bad idea
also yeah there's still tons of
questions coming through holy crap go to
my twitch after this I don't know how to
pronounce this name or what 300 rubles
is and the message is hey there Linus
and Luke I bet you can't read my name
why did that happen what even just even
what okay uh yeah
cheapo hi hey Aaron hi
Yasin hi Coffeyville cheese monkey got
it ah max LTX VIP tickets I want to book
hotel in flight in advance but when will
the VIP meetup take place last year it
was a day before we'll be at the spirit
will be at the same this year not sure
stay tuned
oh crap that might be a bit of a problem
because VIP tickets there's not gonna be
a ton of them we really like we don't we
don't want there to be a ton of them man
probably gonna have to pay those fees
those that eventually yeah I don't know
what to do because I hate how expensive
they are but if we don't make them
expensive they sell out in like 30
seconds yeah yeah max I'm sorry I don't
have a solid I don't have a solid answer
for you yet red slash Ace how much is
Abu that LTX interested in showing off a
smell device for gaming uh I have no
idea you'd have to reach out to :
- tech tips at gmail.com it sounds like
a fun interactive that actually does
sound pretty fun yeah David hey there's
something I really want to say to you
how you literally saved my life but I
don't have enough money to fit in a
super chat so I'm putting it as a
