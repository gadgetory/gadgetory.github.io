dear support is your company's name
really pronounced is there a back
story or was it just because it was
funny I got a reply from audio
co-founder Jason Stoddard personally who
happens to be in the process of
chronicling their journey as a tiny
startup over on head 5 which I'll link
in the video description if you're
interested and you took a moment to
share a very relatable moment with me
where early in the process of product
development on the ass guard his wife
got so tired of hearing him say no I
can't do that I have to do that one
day she said why don't you just call the
new company since that's what
you're always doing and that's the back
story as a fellow small startup I
definitely lolled my wife definitely
didn't anyway from a grab your attention
standpoint I can see why they did it it
makes you go did I just read that and
the slogans that they can make up to
market their amp and dak products which
range from $100 each all the way up to
units that are highly upgradable and
cost 750 dollars each are pretty much
endless alright so with that out of the
way what do I actually think of their
entry-level amp and dak offering the
industrial design is something that
you're going to love or hate it's a
clean and utilitarian steel box with a
curved front and some ventilation holes
applied as needed if I had to complain I
guess I wish that they stacked a little
more gracefully rather than just having
one sit on top of the other with little
rubber feet on the bottom but the
subdued white LED illumination that
they've got is a nice touch the units
each compact in environmentally
responsible boxes that are pretty much
all cardboard that include just rubber
feet a little pamphlet and in the case
of the Magni an AC power adapter that's
it I would have liked a USB cable with
the Modi and maybe a short RCA cable
with the Magni but I understand that to
hit these prices with almost all
manufacturing including the PCB
and production in the US they needed to
keep cost down besides while I don't
care many audio snobs will prefer to buy
their own fancy cables anyway so when it
came to listening tests the main
competitor I compared to was an
objective to an O DAC combo unit from
Mayflower electronics a more compact but
slightly more expensive solution to the
combined stack on paper their specs are
priming pretty similar at least they
look like it to me and while I through
pretty much everything in my arsenal at
them from my HD 600 switch I happen to
have handy right here all the way down
to random gaming headphones in my IE 80
in years when I was done there wasn't
much to say they both sound great to me
so great that I just couldn't tell the
difference with my wife switching them
back and forth on me while I wasn't
looking I don't have any ortho dynamic
headphones yet so I wasn't really
pushing either of them to their limits
and my conclusion is just going to have
to come down to features both solutions
are entirely driverless on your PC and
pick all the right boxes in terms of
specs with their low output impedance
making them suitable for everything from
very difficult to drive 300 plus old
headphones down to IMS the o2
stand-alone can be run off of 9-volt
batteries but is more expensive than the
Magni the o2 has a gain switch to toggle
between quieter and louder output while
 basically says I don't know use PC
volume control or exercise caution with
the volume dial when you use your IMS
the wall wart for the price equivalent
oh - from Mayflower at least plugs into
the front of the unit which is kind of
unsightly but uses an unusual
AC wall wart so it actually goes from
120 volt to 16 volt AC so you can't
easily replace it so they both kind of
have some trade-offs with the only
simple solution to get more features or
not deal with the trade-offs being pay
more this is a value solution that
sounds great let's love it for what it
is and quit complaining all right I get
that speaking of paying more I really
like the style of the guys
they've got expensive stuff but with all
the usual nonsense in the audio world
they take a surprisingly down-to-earth
no-bullshit approach to their marketing
for example right on the hundred dollar
mag knees product page it says it may be
the only amp you'll ever need and
they're three hundred and fifty dollar
Valhalla tube amp product page doesn't
wax philosophical about the superiority
of tubes it just says and I'm
paraphrasing a bit here it's a tube amp
if you like tubes you might like this
and if you don't liked it then you can
swap the tubes up for something else
enjoy love it love that approach another
thing I liked about them is something I
usually can't test but I bought the
stack so I was just another customer to
them I emailed in about an issue with my
HD 280 s that was causing some
interference in the left channel
whenever I adjusted volume on the Magni
they promptly replied and offered to
cover shipping for me to send the unit
back gave me some sensible
troubleshooting steps and explained that
some headphones can act as an RF antenna
in certain cases it was isolated to my
HD 280 s out of 10 plus pairs and only
while turning the volume knob so I
didn't bother exchanging it overall
solid product solid folks over there
making it and highly recommended if you
like their particular flavor of
trade-offs versus the objective 2 and
