West 2016 check the link of video
description down below to see the Razer
Blade stealth today at the Coursera
booth we're checking out the crystal 460
X and in this configuration the crystal
460 x RGB you may be able to tell
through the insides of the case that it
is heavily inspired by the corsair 400 c
but now there's tempered glass on the
side tempered glass on the front because
that's apparently just what happens in
2016 when you're building a case and
they have their cool new RGB fans
including a fan controller built into
the case which has seven different modes
three different speeds and a bunch of
different colors although if you want
access to the sixteen point eight
million different colors that are
supported you will have to use the
software tool in sync with the hardware
tool the lighting controller that's in
here is the same one that comes with the
SP 120 RGB or HD 120 RGB so it can
support up to six RGB fans that's due to
a power limit through SATA because of
all the damn LEDs and powering the fans
and all that other kind of stuff it just
can't support any more than that and
that's honestly pretty much it if you
want to see the rest of the details
about this case go check out 400 C
coverage the rest of the inside is
exactly the same the fan filter in the
front has changed a tiny amount but only
really aesthetically just to show off
the RGB fans in the front now that it is
a tempered glass front of the case it
still has the same basement the same
drive support all that kind of stuff
moving on we have the M 800 people eros
which is a mousepad with 15 individually
controllable RGB zones but never fear if
you just want to set one profile for
everything like I just did with rainbow
wave you can still do that so you can be
lazy and enjoy your sixteen point eight
million colors too alright guys thanks
for watching our coverage of the
Coursera booth at PAX West's 2016 and
thanks for razer for sending us here
this year check out their link at the
video description down below that link
is the ultimate Ultrabook comm and it
sort of makes sense considering it's a
little tiny little laptop and it has 16
gigs of ram and a whole bunch of other
cool stuff so be sure to check that out
I'll see you guys next time stay
