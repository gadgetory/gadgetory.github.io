mailroom which means that it's mail room
no females girls you know let's unpack
some cool stuff that's sitting here in
the receiving area and actually a pretty
special surprise that was that you were
just here for that gag thanks for your
help
cooller masters new master keys Pro L
and Pro s keyboards features 16 point
seven million color RGB backlighting
genuine Cherry MX switches and an
industry-leading
ARM Cortex processor learn more at the
link in the video description so let's
kick things off with the stuff that's
here for our own internal use and for
some upcoming video projects this it's
like hundreds of dollars and Brandon
insists he needs an entire bolt not to
mention he wants a dispenser for it of
this black fire retardant cloth
apparently for controlling light to
which my reply was and is always why do
you make light just to waste it do you
have any idea how much electricity costs
he's always turning on lights and then
putting diffusers on them in clots
covering up certain parts of them we did
a project recently where one of the
cable mod LED strips that we were trying
to use turned out to be defective and
that's why the LTTE edition build had
green lighting in it instead of orange
so they sent us wheels upon wheels of
their RGB lighting kits so now we have
all the RGB not to mention controllers
for them all oh this is great so razors
launching their core external PCI
Express graphics card enclosure and
we'll be getting one very soon but of
course what do you compare something
like that to well we finally got our
hands on one of those beasts external
PCIe things that you can plug into your
laptop with an MDOT two connector from
banggood.com so we're going to be
running that comparison which we are
really excited about all we're waiting
on now is the Razer core this is awesome
so this is actually the same motherboard
that I used for a project a long time
ago why do I need another one of them
you might ask because we are going to be
doing a collab with nerd fusion you guys
might know said that√≠s so 7 us and his
gang saw our ball in you know storage
and transcoding setup and we're going to
be building a similar machine using
unread with a bunch of Seagate drives
with a
or inator from 45 drives calm and super
micros throwing in some hardware and I
am super stoked on that project we're
actually going to go down to Seattle and
install it for them this this is
exciting so LG sent us another care
package or eight so this is their 27 UD
eighty-eight 27 inch 4k IPS free sync
monitor it's got a gorgeous aluminum
stand why do we need eight of them the
follow up to seven gamers one CPU is
coming very very soon this time we're
going to have the machine in a server
room somewhere and we're going to be
running all of our clients little ZOTAC
low powered boxes with these 4k monitors
streaming games off of the server all at
the same time so they provided us a
bunch of monitors for that but the big
surprise for this video and for me
actually was that I asked our warehouse
helper Jake to start putting aside
anything that looked like a letter
addressed directly to me or any of the
LMG team in like a fan mail bin around
the time we did the last mail room where
we read that one really nice letter from
someone who watches our videos and I had
no idea because he never tells me when
things arrived that this thing is
freaking full holy crap so uh let's have
a look at what we got going on here some
people even send packages so I'll use
opening up all these packages as an
excuse to show off the progress on
Brandon's new b-roll area we're gonna
have like RGB lighting in between these
hexagons and there's like for some
reason there's like a gangplank up there
that you can walk anyway like every kid
on Christmas morning I'm gonna start
with the biggest one this is from
Kenneth Kenneth sent us a soup receipt
which appears to be one of those
honeycomb pressure point reduction
things
thanks Kenneth alright so maybe biggest
was a mistake let's go with the smallest
package next all the way from Australia
from king of soldiers $30 to ship this
thing Wow people ask why it's expensive
to buy Linus tech tips t-shirts when
they live in Australia that would be why
Oh once again I have chosen poorly Dairy
Milk Bar with Vegemite only in Australia
they have resealable chocolate bar
packages in Australia what the fuck that
is awesome I guess in America they just
assume that they're gonna man the whole
frickin thing in one sitting which we do
smells ok I hope it's not just like a
big old like hunk of Vegemite in the
middle oh why okay I think there's a
less melty side that was surprisingly
edible I don't know that I would
personally pay thirty Australian dollars
for them but I appreciate that
king of soldiers sent them to us and I
will definitely share those with the
rest of the team not as bad as I thought
it would be though oh this is from
Alexandria Ontario um this is just a
movie I ordered okay let's try again
here our next letter is from Nathaniel
to Linus Colton Luke Nick the other Nick
Yvonne Dennis Taryn John Brandon and

Linus themed hats enjoy all the way from
Prague Czechoslovakia dice a UK slang

wearing this for the rest of the video
this one's addressed from Salt Lake City
to mr. Linus Sebastian CEO and host from
Theodore dear mr. Sebastian I'm writing
to you and your team to thank you for
all you have taught me about modern
technology I have learned an
overwhelming amount of facts I would
never have known I'm a 12 year old 7th
grader whenever I get home I jump on my
couch and see if any recent video
uploads her up and to see if the LAN
show is on apart from all the learning I
enjoy watching Burkle and the rest of
the crew on channel super fun hosted by
the unfathomable Nikki B they always
make me laugh I look forward to meeting
you Terran Luke Colt Nick van Berkel
John Dennis Nick Etzel and Brandon in
the near future
thanks Theodore whoa this is long dear
Linus I am writing to you to express how
grateful I am for you and all the LMG
crew for changing my life from what it
used to be a year ago to what it is now
I used to have a really difficult time
at school however I started watching
some of your videos after remembering
some of your NCIX videos I watched a few
years ago
once I started watching
on a regular basis I learned a lot about
technology and that inspired me to start
doing more with myself than just playing
games which gave me a lot more
self-confidence in day to day life this
really helped me overcome the fact that
I was always feeling quite down and
become the more sociable and
knowledgeable person I am today around
six months ago I built my first computer
by doing something very similar to
Austin and scrapyard wars 3 sorry to
hear that by bridging the 24 pin on one
PSU to provide enough power to the 780ti
I put in this cheap HP workstation
unfortunately the 780 Ti was too big for
the side panel to fit on it so I took
advantage of this by upgrading the CPU
cooler to a shadow rock - very nice
here's a picture of the computer now
love it the reason I'm telling you this
is because all of this wouldn't have
happened without your amazing videos and
advice today I'm still hyped for ever
release online as tech tips tech quickie
and channel super fun I watch her videos
daily I watch the lancha live and
somehow became a mod on Luke Stream sick
man
I also included a UK 50p coin to do
whatever you want with very nice I was
wondering what the wait was in there
alright our next letter is from giuseppe
dear linus i'm from italy and would say
you a huge thanks for all you do every
day I'm studying computer engineering
and before I found you I was interested
only in software now thanks to you I'm
beginning to learn something on hardware
and how the PC works before becoming
Linus tech tips what do you study and
how do you learn all the things that you
do I do not pretend that you reply me
because I know seeing your videos that
you are too busy I just hope you read
this letter because too many times I was
disappointed so I'm sure that you'll
read this letter in June maybe still may
if you read this letter I'll tell you
that I find interest in the project free
week and I'll open a shop in my garage
with my old computer and computers that
other people give me all the money I'll
use for helping people very cool so to
answer your question Giuseppe and it's
may still not June I flunked out of
university and pretty much everything I
know is basically either self-taught or
with tutorials and courses online so
there you have it Bryce right
read on camera please all right now
market Roenick dear linus if you are
reading this i want to say thank you for
taking the time to read this you're
welcome
i'm going to send you an email I was
going to but I wanted to make sure it
didn't get lost well these are more
likely to get lost based on what I've
seen here my name is Bryce Meacham I
have all these YouTube channels are
second bazillion of them yes I just took
the Linus out and put in my name before
your comments section starts freaking
out you wouldn't be the only one Bryce I
love what you do and I want to make the
computer technology community bigger and
I'm inspired by your name therefore I
wanted to continue the trend of Linus
tech tips the reason that mailing is
because I love your videos and I wanted
your input on my channel search it up
and can you possibly an official Linus
tected shirt or a win stealth shirt in
your smallest size with the team's
autographs please
show this on camera my custom setup this
is my real background got the Linus tech
tips background going on my filming set
up you do not have to read this on
camera it is your choice thank you for
the letter Bryce I will I will find some
time to drop you an email in the next
little bit alright this one is a Royal
Mail Nottingham no return address oh
it's from the tech team GB guys beer
line is part of the sloppiness here I
just got released from hospital and I'm
on morphine trauma dulled and an IV of
Wow holy crap I saw the mail video you
did a few weeks ago I thought you might
like this one I've been watching your
videos since 2011 and I've learned an
incredible amount I used the video you
did on the AMD vision black system built
to help build my first PC and have used
a lot of your reviews to make informed
buying decisions you were the reason
that four years ago I started my own
YouTube channel to take a look at cool
tech gear and it's been awesome I know
you must get a lot of requests from
other channels so I won't ask for that
apparently around here but I've got
around 10,000 subscribers around 2.3
million views one last point I wanted to
make was that I feel the need to thank
you last year I went through periods of
suicidal depression and anxiety but
seeing a new entertaining video from you
every morning helped a lot especially
when it got me to smile well you are
very welcome Andrew and thank you for
sending the letter
as well as a surprisingly professional
looking business card other than the
part where you like crossed out stuff
and put other stuff on it nice man so
that's it that's all guys thanks for
checking out this episode of the
mailroom and maybe I will see you again
on the next one but you know what my
favorite thing to get in the mail is
cheques from sponsors and today's
sponsor I don't know sure to it this is
what this is on the mail room oh I don't
know I think it's pretty funny master
opcom is wish oh it's like it's so awful
I can't even say it
ah but it's funny I don't know I could
piss off everyone okay okay okay sorry
I've got my composure I got to keep a
straight face
I guess but you know what's almost as
fun is opening up these great letters
from you guys opening up checks from
sponsors like masse drop and masse drop
is featuring thus entrants dak port Slim
today it built on the success of the dak
port classic features a maximum power
output of 450 milliwatts 109 decibels of
dynamic range point zero zero three
percent total harmonic distortion a low
and a high gain setting depending on
what kind of cams or IMS you're plugging
in and it includes a three foot USB
cable and it drops all the way from a
hundred and fifty dollar MSRP to 9999
because that is the value of mass drop
they find authorized distributors and
manufacturers and they find many eager
buyers and they put them together they
go hey if we connect you two together

guys commit to buy boom so this
particular one is limited to 180 units
