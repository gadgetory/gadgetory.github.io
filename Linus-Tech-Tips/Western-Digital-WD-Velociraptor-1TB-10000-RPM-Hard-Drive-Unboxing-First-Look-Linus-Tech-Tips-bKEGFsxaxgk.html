is bucking the trend this is the WD
velociraptor one terabyte so you guys
remember the Raptor okay so the Raptor
first arrived on the scene in a capacity
that honestly was unusable to thirty six
gigabytes it's like I mean that's that's
like when SSDs first showed up and
you're kind of looking at going well
okay so I could put my OS on it and like
one game mind you at the time you could
put more games than one game because
games were smaller but now that games
are like 17 gigs or more for certain
games I mean my Dragon Age Origins game
is like 30 gigs or something like that
so I'm okay so okay we've determined
that the Raptor while it was fast and
cool and relevant at the time is now too
small too slow and hasn't existed for a
very long time now the Velociraptor came
along and rejuvenated the Raptor line
the Velociraptor was available in higher
capacities it was faster and more
efficient and even then at the time was
still not that relevant because SSDs
were getting higher in capacity they
were getting lower in price and they
were so much faster that you're kind of
looking at it going well like it a lot
doesn't really make that much sense this
looks like a game changer this is the
Velociraptor one terabyte so we're a
long way away from high-performance SSDs
that are one terabyte and come in at a
reasonable price the Velociraptor one
terabyte comes in at a very reasonable
price
remember magnetic storage is still many
times cheaper per gigabyte compared to
solid-state storage
what's the application of this is it for
a boot drive personally I would say no I
would say still this has a very valid
place in a high-performance system
whether it's a workstation or even a
gaming rig where you're using an SSD is
your boot drive and you're using a
velociraptor one terabyte or even you
know a rate of multiple Velociraptor 1
terabytes in the context of needing
high-performance storage that also needs
a lot of capacity so if you're using as
a scratch drive working on very very
large files if you're using it to store
your Steam library so maybe you've got
windows installed on your SSD a couple
key
patience but you've got a huge steam
library of games that is always
expanding well you can't keep that on an
SSD and honestly your storage system
doesn't make that much of a difference
except maybe with game loading times
when you're popping into the game in
terms of actually launching games and
playing single-player especially it
doesn't make that much of a difference
although it's nice to have the little
boost especially well like I said when
you're loading games particularly for
multiplayer so yeah okay useful for
gamers but most of the focus is on
professionals professionals need the
capacity professionals need the speed
but don't necessarily want to compromise
too much in either direction so that's
where the Velociraptor 1 terabyte comes
in we're actually going to be doing full
coverage of this on NCIX tech tips so
don't forget to subscribe to my NCIX
Khan channel but I just wanted to take a
couple minutes open her up show you guys
what a Velociraptor 1 terabyte looks
like this is a two and a half inch thick
drive so you can't just take it off the
included adapter and throw it in a
notebook it most likely won't fit it
comes with a heat sink because this is a
10,000 rpm Drive so that's where I guess
the additional performance it also gets
additional performance from its form
factor the fact that it is a two and a
half inch drive compared to a three and
a half inch drive means that the
platters are much smaller smaller
platters means that your access times
are much lower as well because the head
physically doesn't have to move as far
in order to access the data that you
need the faster spinning platter also
gives it additional sequential
performance on both reads and writes
which is again another advantage of
magnetic storage over solid-state
storage if you're doing something very
right intensive a Velociraptor is
probably a better solution than an SSD
just due to the fact that SSDs do
eventually die I recently had an SSD die
in my Windows Home Server actually which
is a very write intensive application I
was using it as my boot drive and it
also throws it into the drive pool so
for an application where it's going to
get beat up like crazy magnetic and that
may still be the way to go so there you
go thank you for checking out oh right
okay I should finish showing you guys
the heatsink so it's got like this
beastly heatsink on it which looks
amazing awesome cool there you go it's
also got an adapter right here so you're
taking the smaller SATA interface and
you're kind of moving it a little to the
left it's actually a full-size SATA
interface you're moving it over here
where you can easily plug it into a
three and a half inch Bay in your system
okay and right so why the heatsink
because 10,000 rpm drives will run
hotter unless you're cooling them so
this takes care of that don't forget
