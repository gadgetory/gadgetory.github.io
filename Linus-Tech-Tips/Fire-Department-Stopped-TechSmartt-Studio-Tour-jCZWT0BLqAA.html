find that bastard well you know what I'm
gonna steal his Segway he's not charged
say--we I can still balance on it hold

really not as good as I remember some of
that Irish whiskey got a drawer full of
light bulbs these are literally all
broken do you put broken ones in here or
do you store them poorly and do they
break well I'm not really in a position
in most cases to criticize people for
their footwear but this is some pretty

trade in my shoes for Keaton Stiles
