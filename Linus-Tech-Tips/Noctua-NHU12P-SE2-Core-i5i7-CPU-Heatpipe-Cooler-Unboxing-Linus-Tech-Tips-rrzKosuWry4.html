are called special-edition and you know
what I like even more I like special
edition - okay this is the Noctua NH
you'd fall tea very popular cooler this
is the second special edition of this
cooler so basically what that means is
inside the box you will find core i5
core i7 and AMD mounting hardware in
addition to that you're gonna find an
extra fan just like the original se so
why don't we have a look at the
accessory package here first let's get
this open and find out what we've got
inside so here's our AMD mounting
hardware it comes
oh wow this is kind of neat it comes
with a screw driver so you have
everything you will need to install this
cooler here is the common part so these
are the parts that we're gonna use no
matter what we're installing so let's uh
let's get that open and have a look at
it so here you'll see you've got fan low
voltage low noise adapters four five and
seven volts
you've got nth one premium thermal
compound you've got a knock to a case
badge as well as four screws which
you'll need to fix these little screw
down brackets to the cooler okay so then
you've got the screw down brackets which
will fasten into whatever adapter you're
using then you've got oh this is kind of
neat so you can plug both of the fans on
this special edition cooler into one CPU
header on your motherboard then you've
got the little wire mounting brackets
four of them for your two fans and then
last but not least it's kind of stuck in
the bag here you have four little rubber
strips these rubber strips sit in
between the fan and the cooler to
prevent it from vibrating very cool
little feature okay let's see what else
we got in here so you've got an NF p12
1300 rpm fan this is their their most
popular fan according to all the data
we've been able to collect very very
nice fan great static pressure which is
good for pushing through a dense fin
arrangement here's your Intel set so
that's your Intel mounting hardware you
can see oh actually this is kind of neat
I haven't seen this yet they've made
some adjustments to the way they used to
do the mounting holes so you can see
you've got seven seven five
11:56 and 1366 mounting holes for the
bolt through very neat so then we can
put those aside so here's your this is
where your what the pegs that you're
actually going to put through the bottom
of your board and then you've got your
spacers and the little thumb nuts that
you can use to secure it and then you've
got a backplate oh this is hell this is
cool too actually
which includes four seven seven five
users rubber a rubber piece for the
center but since 1156 and 1366 have a
backplate you can remove it and just use
this standard secure firm backplate
pretty sweet okay that is it for the
accessories package here so we'll get
into what's inside the actual big box
here so there's what your second fan and
if I could figure out how to get this
open I would most certainly open it
because that's what I do I open things
okay
finding this quite confusing now but
we're too far into this shot to
potentially redo anything so well press
forward there's your other fan identical
to the first and then here is the cooler
itself so you can see this is a four
heat pipe cooler one two three four it
doesn't have heat pipe direct touch but
I'm sure the camera can see what a shiny
flat finished that is so we'll put show
do the the obligatory finger shot so
it's very very flat there we have it
