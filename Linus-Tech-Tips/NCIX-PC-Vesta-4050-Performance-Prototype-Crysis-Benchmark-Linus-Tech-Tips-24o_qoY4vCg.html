NCIX pc 40-50 so this is the performance
package here now the performance package
has a couple of differences over the
base package for one thing it takes the
6850 that comes in the base package and
upgrades it to a 6870 it takes the 1055t
6 core processor and upgrades it to a
10-9 dt it takes the OEM style memory
without heat spreaders and fanciness and
it adds well heat spreaders and
fanciness so that's pretty cool and it
also bumps up the power supply to AC
sonic 6 20 watt power supply which is
extremely quiet extremely high quality
and just generally extreme good sleeping
and all of that good stuff so what the
NCIX pc facebook guy as you may or may
not know him i actually have no idea
what alias he uses but he's the one who
does a lot of the work on our system
prototyping and evaluation so he's got
me running the crisis benchmark here
what he wanted me to point out about
this particular system is that here i'm
going to go ahead and quit this we had
that running so crisis benchmark with
the latest ah with the latest patch is
he wanted me to show you with 4x
anti-aliasing all details maxed this
system at this price point is actually
able to achieve average frames per
second of over 30 FPS but that's not
really the most impressive part the most
impressive part is that the minimum
frames per second is actually 25 FPS so
if you check out some of the videos on
my blog about the 6870 i actually did a
performance review and i apologize but
my graphs did not include minimum FPS
for all of the benchmarks iran but they
probably should have because the average
FPS for the 6870 looks very competitive
but when you bear in mind that when you
get into a very crowded area or anything
bad happens in general the frame rate
tends to dip well really that's your
performance bottleneck in terms of your
frame rate so if you have a card that
runs at average 30 frames per second and
another card that runs an average 30
frames per second but this one only dips
as low as
and the other one dips to 10 when things
get crowded well it's pretty obvious
which one's a better card so that means
that even though you can say average FPS
30 isn't good enough if it only dips to
25 in the most intense parts that's
pretty darn good he also ran Vantage
with a couple different configs I think
but this is the one for the 6870 single
card so it scores a performance score of
about fifteen point three thousand and
we'll do a separate video once he's
actually got it installed this
particular system is going to feature in
the half 922 case so it should look
pretty sweet once it's installed in
there by masseuse motherboard so you've
got the cool design elements on all of
the MOSFET coolers all of that good
stuff very stylish-looking as well as
the 6870 that's they're all reference
cards right now so no matter which 60 70
you get it's going to look like this and
personally I think the reference cooler
looks pretty sweet don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips and don't
forget to check out the NCIX pc facebook
page we can totally create more
characters so henceforth the guy holding
the camera I can tell you this is not
actually cameraman that's not cameraman
this is our NCIX pc guy and he's not in
front of the camera so he gets to be
whatever I decide to call him so
henceforth his nickname will be crazy
Russian crazy Russian has reminded me
that the performance edition also
includes a WD caviar black hard drive
with 64 megs of cash while as whereas
the basic edition does not include a
black series hard drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
