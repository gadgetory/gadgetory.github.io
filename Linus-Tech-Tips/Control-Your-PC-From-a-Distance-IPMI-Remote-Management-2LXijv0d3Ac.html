to turn your computer on you press this
button on the front you want to see what
the computer is doing you look at the
monitor you want to reset the computer
if it crashes you press this other
button on the front but do you know how
to do all of those things if you're a
thousand miles away oh I know I know
okay well good for you smartypants
here's a gold star for everyone
else stay tuned
donal bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you use the web as
though you're in one of twenty different
countries learn more and try total bear
for free at the link in the video
description so there are a huge number
of reasons that you might want to be
able to access or control your computer
from far away it ranges from totally
mainstream stuff like needing to grab a
file off your desktop for the homework
assignment you were planning to print at
school before handing it in which yeah
whatever I think you still understood my
point to enthusiasts stuff like
realizing you want to share all those
birthday pictures you took of little
Joseph while you're visiting it
Josephine and your FTP is down to IT
administrator stuff like realizing that
someone put windows on one of your
servers and you need to throttle
everyone else in the building's internet
connection so not a moment is wasted
while you download your favorite Linux
distro now to this virtual media install
it and restore order to the universe so
let's start with more basic solutions
and work our way up to the cooler but
regrettably more expensive ones the
first one shouldn't cost a dime because
if you already bought a decent PC in the
last 10 years there's a very good chance
that it has a feature called wake-on-lan
so the way wake-on-lan works is as long
as the computer is plugged into wall
power even if it's in a shutdown state
it actually consumes a little bit of
electricity illuminating power indicator
LEDs on your motherboard or power
supplied even enabling functionality
like charging plugged in phones or
tablets over special USB ports and you
guessed it keeping your network card
juiced up enough that it can wait for
what's called a magic packet and bring
the whole computer to life wake on land
can be configured a handful of ways you
can set it up in the UEFI or the bios of
your motherboard or you can actually do
it from within the network card
configuration panel in most modern
operating systems you can even specify
if you want a magic packet to only work
in sleep versus when the machine is
fully powered down wake-on-lan has
though it requires either a separate
machine that you can remote into using
something like TeamViewer to use a
utility to send a magic packet or a VPN
or some firewall and routing rules to be
configured for it to work from outside
of the local network on top of that
wake-on-lan is not capable of shutting
down the computer that needs to be done
through your operating system so
wake-on-lan does nothing to help you if
the system hangs and is stuck in an
unresponsive state or fails to boot for
one reason or another which leads us
then into some jenkki solutions to this
problem covering a bit of a range in
terms of difficulty and expense first up
is a solution I actually really like
this is a Belkin Wemo you may remember
it from the channel super fun prank
where berkland I made the LMG staff
believe they had triggered the building
alarm you want to check that out here
this one is relatively cheap and I
already had it lying around but any
smart home power socket that can be
remotely switched on and off with an app
will work for this so these things are
intended for something like a bedside
lamp but by configuring the computer to
turn the machine on
after AC power loss and every non laptop
that I've encountered has this option
buried somewhere within the BIOS you can
do a hard shut down using the Wemo by
just cutting power to it and then turn
it back on if for whatever reason it
fails to boot and the machine should try
to boot again well what if I don't want
to spend $50 on a clever wall socket
good question the way a PC powers on and
off is simply by bridging two contacts
on the motherboard power switch allowing
electricity to flow so it's a short
press to power on and to safe power off
and a long press for about five seconds
for a hard forced shutdown so get
creative here's a great thread on the
Raspberry Pi forums that covers some of
the ways folks have used Arduino
and raspberry PI's to wire up the power
on and off switches for their remote pcs
and actually Luke even told me once
about a solution that he created for
someone who didn't want to spend a dime
or any time but who happened to have a
spare a laptop with an external five and
a quarter inch optical drive where he
put the optical drive next to the
server's power switch so he could remote
into the laptop and eject the disk tray
causing it to bump the power switch not
an ideal solution but definitely
creative and the sky is pretty much the
limit here but none of that stuff allows
for the computer to be fully managed in
the same way that you could if you were
sitting in front of it and that is where
ipmi comes in this Super Micro
motherboard actually a super sexy
soon-to-be-released micro ATX model the
support for up to 22 core processors
four sticks of quad channel memory and
dual onboard 10 gigabit network cards
the x10 SRM TF
comes with a dedicated additional
network port that is just for ipmi or
intelligent platform management
interface you assign it a static IP
within the BIOS then you can use any
computer on the same network to navigate
to that IP login and assuming you've got
your job up to date and your security
settings all configured you'll be
looking at a whole wealth of freaking
cool tools and functionalities you can
see the system hardware you can monitor
server health to see if your CPU is
running cool enough and if it's not you
can check if your fans are still
spinning or you can set up a different
fan curve you can do event logs you can
mount virtual disks and drives you can
of course power on or off the computer
in any way you please and you can even
do advanced things like updating the
BIOS or the IPMI firmware and adjusting
BIOS settings using the real-time view
of the VGA output that's on the back of
the board the problem is that SiC
features like a real-time view of
exactly what the machine is outputting
often require special Hardware aside
from just that network port to be built
into the motherboard and while
motherboards with add-on ipmi modules a
soos has a number of them available do
exist they mostly come with IP mi or
without it there are K VMs that are
remotely knowledgeable but they are much
more expensive than investing in IPMI
capable Hardware in the first
place and they won't support everything
that an IP my board can do now to be
clear IPM is not perfect and poses some
serious security risks I mean remember
when someone has physical access to your
machine it's not your machine anymore
but it's the king when it comes to
remote management and it saved me quite
a few late-night trips to the office
