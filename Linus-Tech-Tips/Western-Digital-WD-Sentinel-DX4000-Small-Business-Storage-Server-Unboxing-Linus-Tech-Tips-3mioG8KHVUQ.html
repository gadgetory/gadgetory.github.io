the small business owners delight this
is meant to be a turnkey storage and
backup and data access solution for
small businesses who basically don't
want to lose all of their data this is
the WD sentinel DX 4000 outer brown box
and have a look at the inner brown box
so that's the shipping carton so let's
start by saying that this thing is not
cheap this is a value proposition but
not a price play this is not really
meant for consumers we gave you guys
some idea the four terabytes q which is
the one that we have here is around 800
bucks and moving up to something like a
12 terabyte version you'd be looking at
closer to 1500 to 2000 dollars so what's
the value proposition here well for one
thing it includes actually in a
weightless
let's okay you guys will get the value
proposition later and I should preface
this by saying if you want a far more
detailed look at this we will be doing a
follow-up video on the NCIX comm channel
where we take a much closer look at it
the product like this is not served
correctly by a basic unboxing but we
might as well film an unboxing if we
have to open up the box so let's start
with what WD has to say for themselves
on the outside so the package contents
is the small office storage server AC
adapter rj45 cable okay system
requirements are basically you need an
internet connection and a router okay
that's pretty basic two Gigabit Ethernet
ports two USB 3.0 ports those two
Gigabit Ethernet ports are very
interesting because they are failsafe
which means they are redundant so even
if you lose an Ethernet port you will
not lose access to your data uses an
Intel Atom d5 25 dual-core processor
with 2 gigs of RAM and runs Windows
Storage Server 2008 r2 essentials now
when you break down the cost of this
unit including the hardware they're
using that Intel processor as well as
enterprise grade Intel hardware for the
rest of the infrastructure that supports
it plus they've actually got a copy of
Windows Server on it
us some of the other stuff that they
include it starts to look like a very
compelling value supported client
operating systems
hold on top rating systems pretty much
everything that most people would care
about supported web browsers pretty much
everything those people would care about
Network puppet Network ah great it
supports Active Directory so if you have
an existing Active Directory this will
integrate easily into that due to its
Windows due to its Windows basis network
protocols ok foster raid levels aha raid
1 and raid 5 so this is a 4 terabyte
skew which means it has 2 2 terabyte WD
re series drives inside these are both
1.2 million our mean time between
failure drives because this isn't meant
as the server not as a consumer product
and there is no room for failure of data
in a server so this oh yeah this this
what's more telling about all of this is
what's absent here
there's nothing about je baud nothing
about raid zero nothing about anything
but raid 1 and raid 5 the fentanyl does
not support drive configurations that
are not safe and redundant so this 4
terabytes q will automatically be
configured in raid 1 which means that in
terms of actual usable space we're gonna
have two terabytes to start with and
that if we add an additional drive will
go up to 4 terabytes and it will run in
raid 5 automatically it also supports
online raid level migration and capacity
expansion which means I can continue to
use my data
I'll be at reduced performance while I
throw in my third drive and upgrade my
storage space very cool
other features share folder level access
control bare metal backup and restore
for up to 25 computers oh that's unreal
another really cool thing so the way it
does backups is actually purely
incremental which means if you have you
know let's say you max it up you've got
25 computers and you've got let's say
the 12 the 12 terabytes q so 8 terabytes
of usable data realistically can you
back up 25 computers on a terabytes no
except that you can be
it is only it is not starting any
complicated data so the Windows
operating system files for example are
only going to be stored once and then it
can use those same files to restore any
of those 25 computers also when it takes
multiple snapshots of a system it's only
going to copy any changes in the data
rather than recreating the whole thing
so it makes very efficient use of the
storage space that it has moving right
along
file folder level restore front panel LC
for search establish built-in DLNA
server so yeah so if you do
presentations in your office for example
so this is not the same use of a deal
and a server that you'd have at home
where you want to stream videos to your
iPad not about that it's about you know
training videos and any other media that
you might need for your business not for
not for our home use okay USB UPS
support okay so supports USB UPS and
check this out guys so this thing is
serious business so with them let's
start but you know what no let's do
accessories first
so there's your interviews your Ethernet
cable there's your power brick well that
fsp know no name power brick okay
there's your cable for that and that's
pretty much it technical support
warranty guide okay that might be
important you want to hold on to this
especially if you're a business user no
WD has designed this thing from the
ground up to be as simple as possible so
you don't necessarily have to have an IT
guy at your business in order to use
this now we're gonna be testing it and
making sure that that's actually the
case but WD seems very confident that
almost anyone can use it
here's an administrators quick install
guide which explains a little bit about
what the Sentinel is all about and how
to use it shows you how to connect it
shows you how to configure it okay so
this is uh not all English actually oh
that's relatively quick there's only a
few steps how to connect your computers
to it including different os's
authenticate and join our and connect to
the server okay so what makes this
server great hardware we've got a
cooling fan servers need cooling that's
good we've also got
dual power in these are failsafe which
means if you buy an additional power
brick even if your power brick fails
even if your internal power supply on
the Sentinel fails you will not
experience any downtime two USB 3.0
ports for auxilary storage as well as
for you know running a UPS over USB and
then there are your dual again failsafe
Gigabit Ethernet connections on the side
you got some ventilation holes on the
other side you got some more ventilation
holes on the bottom you don't see
anything really out of the ordinary
actually hold on a second
so what makes this thing you know really
enterprise-grade server grade a few
things there are your redundant power
supply input so if you grab yourself an
additional power supply making sure that
you use the appropriate the appropriate
spec for your Power Grip you will
actually experience no downtime in the
event of a failure even of the internal
components that are on the other side
here so that's pretty cool
there's your USB port for any you know
additional functionality you need
whether it's using it as a print server
or whether it's using a UPS for backup
and there are your failsafe dual Gigabit
Ethernet ports we've also got a cooling
fan on the back as well as your serial
number and information Kensington lock
spot is right here some ventilation
holes on the side some ventilation holes
on the other side especially if you load
this thing up with four drives you're
gonna want it reasonably well ventilated
on the front you can see it opens up
here and there is a drive so let's not
fuss with that one let's instead one of
the empty ones so in terms of drive
mounting it's actually very
straightforward now this is cool because
our Sentinel is is sort of four gig or 4
terabyte but WD sent us an additional
drive now it should be noted that it is
a special SKU that goes into the
Sentinel WD is taking the data security
of small businesses very seriously you
can't just use any re drive there's
there's a matrix available I think it's
online which shows you which drives you
can use in order to upgrade the storage
of your Sentinel so for the same reason
it does not support running outside of
raid 1 or raid 5 it does not support non
enterprise-grade hard drives okay
you're not does not meant to be
achievement as where you're using
consumer grade hardware for a business
use this is a business class piece of
hardware so anyway they sent us an
additional two terabyte drive and the
upgrade process is as simple as even if
the machine is powered on lining it up
there's no mounting screws no nothing
dropping it in I mean don't drop it be
careful to hard drive hold on
ah there we go pressing it in and
closing it that is the upgrade process
you can do it while it's on and it won't
even affect your ability to access your
data and it's gonna start putting this
in raid 5 mode which will double our
available capacity by switching from
raid 1 to raid 5 I'll take that out for
now though because we do want to have a
look at it running in raid 1 mode when
we do our full tech tips before we go
much further into that okay so there's
on the front you've also got our LCD
readout we've got activity LEDs for the
four drives as well as navigation
buttons for here as well as a power
button so that's you know what let's
call that it for the unboxing and I want
you guys to definitely check out the
full video on this on NCIX com
maybe this isn't for you but if you're
like the tech IT guy in your family you
know anyone who has a small business
slick was showing me some pretty
terrifying statistics it was something
in the neighborhood of forty to sixty
percent of small businesses never open
their doors again after a catastrophic
data loss think about that for a second
and if you know anyone who has a small
business where they're still using you
know I don't have a thumb drive on me
but where they're still using thumb
drives to move critical business data
around it's not the right way to go
thumb drives can fail I personally had
one fail a little while ago that was
very inconvenient for me this gives
everyone remote access to the data they
need you can set everything up based on
you which users have access to what and
when and all of all those kinds of
settings this is more along the lines of
what people should be using so thank you
