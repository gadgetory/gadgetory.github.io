a data recovery company but not in the
way that you might think like you can't
just drop in with your dead hard drive
and ask them to fix it for you their
business is developing the software
hardware and the techniques that are
used by everyone from mom-and-pop shop
technicians to huge data recovery houses
right on the other side of this wall is
actually the classroom that they use to
Train police and other government
agencies on data recovery so they
sponsored our trip out here to do two
things one to show consumers how to save
money on data recovery service and
number two to show repair shops how they
can dramatically improve their chances
of recovery for their customers
scenario 1 of hard drive failure is
clicking and clacking noises sometimes
without being detected by the system
okay this happens it's probably a
physical problem so if the data is
important don't do anything
unplug your drive and send it to a pro
immediately or your chances of a
successful recovery will be dramatically
lower or possibly even zero a pro is
going to use tools like these and a
laminar flow workstation like this one
or even a full-on cleanroom like the one
that I checked out over at Dr savers to
physically swap components into the
failed drive from donor drives sometimes
this needs to be done multiple times in
cases where one bad part is causing the
other ones to fail prematurely they'll
also use professional tools from
companies like deep spark so I didn't
know it but I was actually using disk
imager for when I performed my own head
swap in that video scenario number 2 is
an electronics problem maybe a broken
SATA connector or a burned chip on the
PCB could be causing the drive to not be
detected by your system the most common
symptom here is total silence now
sometimes you will need to call a pro
for this and if the data is
mission-critical
you should always call a pro but for
waste to have rather than need to have
data this type of failure actually
exposes the platters of the drive and
therefore the data to much less risk so
in some cases you can attempt a home
repair if you're handy with a soldering
iron
now deep spar had this whole demo plan
for me the the
cBS chip actually handles overcurrent
protection for the drive and can fail
due to an external issue so just
removing it from the PCB can possibly
brick the drive because you're removing
the overcurrent protection but in many
cases it can allow the data to be
recovered if it's hooked up to a known
good system and power source but we are
throwing that demo out the window
because I brought these far an
unexpected present this is Terrence
personal dead hard drive that failed
when we hooked it up to a faulty power
supply cable while he and I were at the
office late upgrading his system now he
would likely be quoted three to five
hundred US dollars minimum to fix this
and since he's Terran and he doesn't
remember exactly what's on it he's not
gonna pay that much to get it back so
we're gonna see how we do with a DIY
grade repair Derek you ready so what
we're gonna do first is we're gonna
verify the diagnosis now I'm already
pretty sure that we're gonna power up
this drive and we're gonna hear a whole
lot of nothing so that means there's a
good chance that this is an electronics
problem okay so we power down now
unfortunately swapping out a PCB on a
drive isn't as simple as going to the
hard drive PCB store and buying one yeah
if only life were that easy right look
at him he's defeated he's defeated so
eBay and Craigslist are your friends now
fortunately in Tara's case he already
had a donor drive that looks like it's
gonna be suitable so there's a couple
things to watch for you need the drive
model to be the same so not just this
drive model but also this model number
right here so these look good and you
even need the PCB revision to be the
same now these two are a slightly
different color here but that's not
important what matters is that they're
both revision a and they both have
exactly the same model so these
should theoretically be suitable okay
now we're at the point where most
amateurs would screw up this kind of a
recovery they'd go okay well now we take
the good PCB put it on the bad Drive and
bippity Boppity off to the races right
wrong data density on modern drives is
so high that the manufacturing
tolerances are nowhere near good enough
that every drive will just work out of
the factory so they have to build in
compensation and calibration that is
unique to your individual drive it's
usually stored on a little 8 pin ROM
chip that looks like this and that
specialized data has to be brought over
so want to show us how to desolder and
resolder a ROM chip all right let's do
it let's not screw these up which ones
which D on this one okay we're good
there's a pro tip right there my friends
better to market first
now we're ready to put the PCB back on
and we can go test it right yeah all
right here goes nothing it's not picking
up do you want to have a look at it
okay so unfortunately sometimes when you
hook up to a bad power source it kills
more than one thing so we fixed our PCB
problem but we're still getting this
zero capacity nonsense here and we're
getting kind of like a chirping noise
and Jarek like drive whispered with the
horse whisperer for hard drives over
here and told me that what he thinks is
that it's the preamplifier chip that
right so that's a component of the drive
head which means that we actually need
to dig a little deeper on this thing
we're gonna take it over to the
landowner flow workstation and tear it
apart so what this station does is it
uses a really thick filter here to pull
all the dust out of the air and then
you've got this constant flow of clean
air so that none of the contaminated air
around us can get into the drive that's
really important with how close the head
is to the platter even the smallest
speck of dust could cause catastrophic
damage to the platter as it's flying
over it so now we're swapping the known
good heads from the working drive into
our bad drive
and actually now that I come to think of
it by known-good I mean I have no idea I
have not actually tested this drive
presumably Tarun checked it before he
gave it to me if it helps it all for the
tension of this situation I still don't
know that this will actually work the
way we want I mean we could have screwed
something up right what's your
confidence level right now
that's not bad
alright let's go give it a shot so this
is it moment of truth
now I'm not superstitious but I'm gonna
cross my fingers I'm not gonna knock on
wood though cuz then we might like bump
the dress hey no you think we're gonna
get it now that's actually a really
important point just because we are able
to read data off of this drive does not
mean that teryn can take it pop it back
in a system and start using it again
this is still a dead drive so what we're
doing right now is we're pulling a bit
4-bit copy of all of the data off and
we're putting it on to a new one we are
imaging the drive a 97 megabytes a
second sorry okay so I have to do this
for another six hours scenario number
three is a firmware problem now for
unusual issues deep knowledge of hard
drive firmware design and a professional
tool like a PC 3000 is necessary but the
fees that you can expect to pay to
someone who can interpret this matrix
level stuff right here would be anywhere
from $500 to easily thousands of dollars
depending on the complexity of the
problem the good news is that many
common firmware issues can actually be
solved with pretty much a button press
and that is where deep sparse tool the
rapid par
wow this is taking a really long time to
detect drive still works fine oh here we
go it's um a second those ages yeah
we've got a petition it's not three
partitions off of it already though and
then we're just waiting on the dishes to
loading what a frustrating and tedious
line of work but you get to deliver
people their data back right but but
someone gets their data back there we go
okay so now then we're good it's just
that every time we have to plug in this
drive it takes a lot of time to detect
it so wait so everything is slow like
this funny story I was actually here two
weeks ago and but we lost part of the
data from that shoot last time we were
able to show that the data was
transferring at such a speed that it
would take infinitely long to get it off
meaning that the drive would be
guaranteed to be dead by the time we
actually managed to recover anything
from it but it's going even slower why
it's just getting bogged down doing
something that it's not supposed to be
doing so instead of giving us the data
it's just
and this is completely custom hardware
and software is that right correct who
you build everything from this from
scratch it's made of Canada the reason
is that off-the-shelf operating systems
make certain assumptions about the
hardware namely that it works so as soon
as the hardware doesn't work it starts
running into issues and that's why any
software product is going to get stymied
by certain drive malfunctions whereas
when you build your own thing from the
ground up that expects problems well you
can have a different experience
so what Serge is doing right now in
their software is he's running a
diagnostic test on the drive to
determine what exactly the firmware
problem is so this process takes a
couple of minutes and what it's doing is
it's going through and it's finding any
discrepancies and the firmware of this
drive compared to what's supposed to be
there and then it's overriding them and
that doesn't make it so the drive loses
any data no no okay so now all that's
left is power down the drive touch
interface
nice touch then theoretically we pop
this guy back into our drive dock here
and now oh I thought I heard sorry okay
power on the drive Hey
there it is oh that's way faster of
course though the acid test is a file
copy
can we get data off of this drive now
now that discovery process is going
faster hey there we go this is much
better
awesome here we go there we go fantastic
so with the rapid bar we went from not
being able to copy the data at any kind
of reasonable speed to now we are
copying all the data off this drive now
one of these guys does cost about $2,000
so end-users aren't expected to buy one
but since it's so simple to use if you
the end-user can find a shop that has
one you should expect to pay about 300
bucks for a recovery that it can handle
so I mean maybe that's still not worth
it for photos of that night of binge
drinking or whatever but if your tax
records and your will are on your hard
drive it's worth considering in scenario
number four we're gonna see another
solution that you can actually try at
home and this time without any
specialized tools all we need is a USB
Drive doc our drive and a computer so
this is an example of logical corruption
we're gonna go ahead and plug in our
drive and power it on and you're gonna
see something that you might have seen
before so this can be caused by
accidental formatting viruses or Windows
errors see this you need to format the
disk and drive D but hold on a second I
had data on this okay
step number one don't click format then
we're gonna use a software called our
studio but there are actually free
options out there that are somewhat
similar we're gonna go ahead and we're
gonna click on our drive here we're
gonna double click empty space and if
it's not actually a hardware issue
da-da-da-da-dah so no bad sectors and
look at this here's all our files they
are ready for recovery fantastic this
type of software can also help us
diagnose scenario number five so the
thing is is that unless you drop it or
something
a hard drive doesn't generally go from
working perfectly to completely dead in
an instant-read instability almost
always comes first and these types of
drives these mostly dead drives that
haven't fully failed yet make up the
majority of cases that get sent in for
data recovery the symptoms of these
drives can include not being detected in
the BIOS preventing the computer from
booting spitting out random errors well
just getting so slow that you can't do
anything with them anymore
you shouldn't have any noticeable
knocking or clicking yet and that
exactly the situation so we're gonna
fire up our studio here and oh that's
interesting our computer is completely
frozen up one of these partitions has
shown up but this one's just not
populated here's a little Windows hack
that you might be able to use to get
access to a drive like this all you need
to do is start up the command prompt as
an administrator start up Windows is
built-in partition tool oh I got a right
the computer's completely locked up I
got a power down this Drive first there
we go now ever thing seen how everything
comes back then we just need to run a
couple of commands auto mount disabled
and auto mount scrub with our tweak
what's gonna happen here is that Windows
isn't going to try to load a drive
letter and that's actually a good thing
because it can hang the entire operating
system while Windows tries to mount the
file system and it will try and then
timeout in the know it'll restart and do
it forever doing more damage to what is
already a damaged drive in the first
place so now that we've done this we can
open up Disk Management and boom there
it is there's our 300 gig drive and we
can actually launch our our Studio
software now because the system isn't
completely locked up in cases where the
drive doesn't have a ton of bad sectors
we actually can attempt a recovery
that's looking for oh this is taking
longer than it should so this is the
point where as a data recovery
technician your gut feeling should be to
stop what you're doing because we're
only 17 percent of the way through and
this drive has many bad sectors which
are taking anywhere from one to three
minutes to detect each time now the
problem here is that this is a typical
software behavior where the drive
encounters are read error and it just
keeps trying and keeps trying to keep
trying this puts a lot of strain on the
drive and can cause it to fail right in
the middle of this type of recovery
attempt so we're gonna switch over to
the rapid bar and
about that method so all we're gonna do
is plug our drive in here go ahead and
power it up and then there are a couple
of things that might make us think that
this the Rapids bar is going to work
better than a standard computer for one
thing if it encounters a bad sector
instead of Aria tempting Andrea tempting
wearing out the drive it will actually
cut off its reattempt after a couple of
hundred milliseconds this dramatically
reduces the stress on the drive for
another it actually borrows a lot of DNA
from their higher-end products of this
is the disk imager so when we set our
source drive parameters here we select
the brand and the interface and what
it's doing is it's actually taking
information about the behavior of our
drive as it scans it and it's uploading
it to deep spar servers where it
compares it against the database their
server then sends our rapid bar some
recommendations for how to deal with it
to help accelerate the recovery pretty
cool right so we can double click
partition one here and boom we're
running a scan so you can see here we
already hit one of those bad sectors but
instead of trying for two minutes it's
only gonna try for a couple of seconds
before it moves on now we're never gonna
get back any data that was on those
sectors but at least we can get back
whatever is on either side so check this
out we didn't get everything you can see
there's some corrupted stuff here but
even though this drive had hundreds of
bad sectors instead of taking two
minutes every time it hit a bad sector
this whole scan only took us about seven
minutes much less wear and tear and
there's some other cool stuff too for
this trick we need a drive that is in
much worse condition let's go ahead and
power this on
that's the hard drive that's less fine
that's not fine at all yeah yeah turn it
off but the rapid bar has another
borrowed trick up its sleeve so all we
got to do is plug this in but we're not
gonna power the drive on right away
because we don't want it to start
thrashing instead we're gonna let the
software interface power on the drive
and then start eating commands to it
immediately so that it doesn't get a
chance to try to click itself to death
here so it's powering it on and then
hopefully we're not gonna hear a ton of
clicking cuz that would mean the
potential for our dead head to cause our
other head to fail that's something
that's really common once you've got one
head gone the other ones tend to follow
soon
smart failed ok that makes sense now in
a moment here it's gonna start checking
the heads and media we're probably gonna
hear a couple of clicks here because you
can't check if the head works without
trying to move it not good
Diagnostics are done now so 19% of our
tested sectors do contain data there's
something to recover here as we expected
one of our three heads is that 46%
health now we're not getting back
anything that's on that platter with the
bad head unless we do a head swap and
put a new head in the drive so if this
stuff isn't mission-critical what we're
gonna do is we're gonna build a head nap
here then we're gonna disable that head
and see how much of the data we can pull
off all we got to do is click this skip
anything on head one click apply and now
we're getting a new sector map by heads
comes our files and directories and boom
there it is file tree baby love it and
through all this accessing you don't
hear any clicks anymore because that
head has been parked as long as we're
using the rapid fire so this thing is
really cool but to be clear the rapid
fire is also not magic so of the jobs
that come into your shop some of them
are gonna be solvable with software and
then of the ones that remain about half
of them
can be dealt with with the Rapids bar
and then the other half are still gonna
have to be outsourced to a professional
that's armed with more powerful tools
and probably a clean room so disk imager
for along with the software that
accompanies it allows very fine control
of things like the reattempt threshold
it has a ton of configuration knobs that
a professional can tune and can be used
to work on drives that the Rapids bar
can't even interface with yet like for
example a PCI Express nvme SSD the
Rapids Bar can handle a regular SATA SSD
which by the way can have bad sectors as
well so that's pretty much it so
hopefully whether you're an IT manager
or you run your own shop or you're just
an end-user
you've gained some knowledge about the
data recovery business and how it works
behind the scenes
now of course deep spark just want to
throw this in deeps for our values your
business but any video about data
recovery would be incomplete without a
reminder that in a perfect world you
wouldn't need it please backup your data
because the deeps bar guys would love
nothing more than to live in a world
where no one loses their data and they
can just sit on a beach somewhere
drinking cocktails instead of hanging
around with me all day so thanks for
watching guys if you disliked this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit like get subscribed and maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff that we featured in the video
description this would be a great
addition to any tech shop out there
while you guys are at it we've got our
merch store listed in the video
description as well and a link to our
community forum which you should totally
join you look very satisfied right now
yes this Drive is broken exactly the way
I wanted it to be for this demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
