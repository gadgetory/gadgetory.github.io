cooler which you can see to my right
your left thermal right also sent me a
fan to go with it the ex silent 140 now
the Spitfire six is compatible
out-of-the-box with either a 120 or 140
millimeter fan but I thought I'd just
take a moment and unbox this particular
fan for your unboxing pleasure so it is
high efficient and low noise by 11 wings
design so what they mean is that it has
11 wings ok our wings up blades run
wings liquid state bearing in 50,000
hour long 50,000 long life hours 7 volts
of power usage can be adjusted via fan
control device ok
it is a 140 by 140 by 25 millimeter so
there's a standard thickness fan it has
a liquid steeper I don't know what
liquid state bearing is to be perfectly
honest with you
startup voltage is 7 volts that's pretty
good typically very very very good fans
will start up around 5 volts but 7 volts
is still very respectable for a 140
millimeter fan especially because I'm
thinking in terms of 120 Mills rated
current rated speed is 900 rpm you can
read all this why am I even reading this
out there you done reading good okay so
let's unbox this fan and then I'm
actually going to show the procedure to
install it on to the Spitfire six
graphics card cooling so 140 millimeter
fans actually let me grab a 120
millimeter fan that I tossed out of the
way when I was clearing my desk so I'll
just grab that so this is a 140
millimeter fan versus a 120 millimeter
fan you can see it is quite a lot bigger
so that means that just like moving from
80 to 120 millimeter you can just spin
the blades slower and still get the same
amount of cooling so this is kind of a
smoked gray acrylic sort of look to it
it's kind of nice and you've got a
thermal write logo up in the middle here
the frame itself is more of a more of an
opaque black and this is interesting
there are whole oh I get it heard there
are holes around this fan because this
is not the LED version but it looks like
you could you could actually probably
jury-rigged LEDs into this fan if you
really wanted to let's look around at
the back so on the back you can see
we've got the basic specs for the fan
alright I've had enough talking about
the fan
let's talk about the sleeving on the
cable so the sleeving on the cable is
reese actually this is pretty darn good
quality sleeping hey you know what so
few companies have this figured out
where they use a good quality sleeping a
good quality heat shrink and then the
cable you can't see the color of it so
you can see they sleeved right up to the
end and you cannot see the color as the
cables inside at all so I'm gonna set
this up so that the fan is actually
pushing air down onto my heatsink okay
so I pull back the wire clips just like
this I've already inserted them into the
holes and I'll get the cameraman to have
a look at some at the one on his side so
give me two seconds here cameraman and I
will get around to that side to show you
so you can see there are holes on the
side of the Spitfire six there are two
at the either end extremes so those are
the 140 millimeter holes and then there
are two more one here and one here right
above these two heat pipes so that is
four 120 millimeter there's one more
here and I have no idea what that's for
so why don't we go ahead and put the fan
down and you know what to be perfectly
honest I had pretty sure that thermal
right includes little rubber strips to
dampen the noise but they would be in
the in the box right now and I don't
have that handy so you can see it mounts
quite you know what I wonder if that's
what the foams are for well I'm not
gonna stress about it
let's turn on the system and you can see
how loud this fan is I don't have it
plugged in yet but I'm gonna plug it
into one of the fan headers on the
classified motherboard that I'm running
here now something to note is that the
compatibility for the Spitfire six I was
a little bit confused about it when I
did my original video and so the
compatibility is with the 58 50 and the
58 70 and this vrm module is also
compatible with the 58 fifty and fifty
eight 70 but what thermal right doesn't
tell you because it's possible that they
don't know is that this heatsink is also
compatible with the Eyefinity six
edition 58 70 so that's the 2gig version
of this card so if you look around at
the back of the video card itself you
gotta kind of get down at this angle
here cameraman sorry about that thermal
rate has actually included so many extra
memory
thinks that I was able to not sorry
about that that I was able to install it
on the four on the 2gig version of the
card without having to buy any
additional memory heatsink so good on
them for for going ahead and doing that
anyway I wish I could show you some
temperature settings but I don't have
the drivers installed but thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the X silent
140 as well as the installation onto the
Spitfire six</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
