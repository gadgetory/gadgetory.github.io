the ruckus our 700 enterprise-grade
access point $1,000 AC wireless access
point as a standalone AP and then
compare it against a reasonable
cross-section of other AC access points
including ubiquitous and muraki's mr 18
I had this
Gigantor spreadsheet where I was going
to put all the data and everything and
then I took a step back and realized I
was tackling too much at once the first
thing I need to establish before I start
evaluating you know which business grade
Wi-Fi gear is best from an enthusiast
perspective is whether enthusiasts
should care about this product category
at all or if they should keep spending
all their money on graphics cards so
that's what's coming in this video
oh and coming soon is our review of the
Logitech G 9 10 RGB mechanical keyboard
but first the intro from December 13th
to 20th 2014 you can save on select
until CPU Schnucks and SSDs with special
holiday rebates from select retailers
click now to learn more so where would I
get the idea that any individual
consumer might want to spend this much
on an access point raucous thought it
was stupid and refused to even loan me
one to do this kind of a test but I
really wanted to try it so I actually
bought one to do this video I was
inspired by an awesome article that I
read on WLAN proz.com while researching
solutions to my ongoing issues with
periodic hiccups and NVIDIA games dream
and HD movie streaming to my media
center in the article they investigated
the performance of a variety of high end
ApS in a classroom environment and while
the nuts and bolts of the results you
know which model one which test etc have
lost some of their relevance since there
are newer products released now the
realization that I had while reading it
was that most router tests are basically
being done in a vacuum so to speak to
control variables a perfectly reasonable
thing to do many reviewers will pair a
single client to the access
point measure the speed and then if
we're lucky they'll do it again from a
few different distances so we can get
some idea of how that performance scales
over on an area but this doesn't address
what kind of performance you can expect
when multiple clients are running
intensive tasks concurrently something
that can happen easily in the real world
if you've got a few family members with
their own mobile devices in your home so
I designed my tests and I can already
see having finished the data now that
they've got some issues but it's a start
with the intention of determining not
only the performance at various ranges
of a high-end router with an integrated
access point like a consumer-grade thing
versus a top-of-the-range business AC
access point but also the performance at
a fixed range when there are many other
clients across the network putting load
on it so I'll start with the range data
the range on the r700 is truly
exceptional inside the house and even
from the front yard speeds were less are
similar to what my Linksys wrt54g
location but once I got across the
street in front of the house it was 30%
faster and then when I walked down to my
mailbox a total distance of about a
hundred and twenty feet with the
neighbor's house directly between my
Droid turbo and the access point it was
still able to achieve acceptable
sustained speeds for web browsing and
even light media streaming next we'll
look at our four scenarios that I used
to evaluate performance with other
clients using the network in the light
test every access point configure I
tried worked fine but we can already see
performance of the iperf test fall off a
little bit especially on the wrt just
from having google play music a twenty
seven fifty kilobyte twitch stream
running at source quality and a PC
refreshing a basic webpage every three
seconds running to simulate what it
might be like when a few family members
are on their phones or computers on an
average evening in the medium load test
I add a second video stream running on
the
same PC that's doing our internet
browsing test it's a 20 megabit 1080p
video the kind that many people download
to an ass and then watch from a computer
there were no interruptions to any of
the devices in the medium test either
and any config in the heavy load test we
add another 2750 twitch stream and a 20
megabits 720p and video game stream
stream and this is where the men gets
separated from the boys with game stream
decent throughput is necessary but
latency is of paramount importance
because the user is interacting with a
remote PC in real time in our case and
in a Sai gaming notebook this was the
last test where the r700 achieved
perfect performance at 2.4 gigahertz
before running the stress test and once
the stress compress got turned on it
turned to crap with one of the twitch
streams being interrupted and gaming on
the shield becoming impossible so that
is something to bear in mind as you look
at the throughput numbers in these tests
if running the stress test causes other
clients to stop working then it's not a
representation of how much the network
can handle on top of what it's already
doing at 5 gigahertz the r700 handled
this flawlessly even completing the
stress test with only occasional
choppiness
in the game stream test but the same
cannot be said for the wrt not only did
it put up much worse numbers during the
stress test but before the test even
started on 5 gigahertz one of the PC
video streams failed outright and game
stream was hitching periodically which
leads us to the torture test where we
found that we could reach the limits of
the r700 by throwing another laptop
running at 1080p YouTube video and a 50
megabit 1080p network video stream and
an Nvidia shield portable running a 3000
kilobit per second video stream and even
then it actually has performed
reasonably well now I did manage to get
this 50 megabits stream to glitch out a
little bit earlier in the day but now
everything is running flawlessly even
with the torture tests so that means we
are
pretty much at the limit now when I run
the test itself for the throughput when
I run the throughput test Tomb Raider
will chop and then this video will
definitely turn off but overall a very
impressive job is being done by the r700
of managing this workload another cool
thing to note is it even with all this
running if you run a speed test on
another computer completely unrelated
somewhere else in the house but
connected wirelessly you can still get
like seven millisecond ping times to
nearby servers which is about what I can
do on a wired connection so just
something here will suffer but it does a
great job of managing all that the
inaudible you RT was a total mess in
this test though so I'm reporting 14
mega bit for the iperf test but it's a
completely meaningless number I mean
even without I perf running both PC
video streams cut out the YouTube stream
cut out and game stream was completely
unusable only the twitch streams managed
to hold together so closing thoughts
time do high end access points make
sense for enthusiast consumers honestly
I think the answer is mostly no not
really anything anyone with a large
house like 2500 square feet or more and
multiple stories who doesn't want to
deal with slow range extenders or
multiple access points and then the
lousy connections sometimes and handoff
issues that are associated with that may
actually benefit from one of these but
they are paying a lot for features that
they'll never use like the ability to
add a dedicated controller somewhere
else in the house and more access points
to build a managed array of access
points for most people adding additional
consumer ApS on different channels and
then switching between them manually
especially on 5 gigahertz where there
are so many channels available will be
much more economical and as long as the
clients are more spread out than they
were in our torture tests higher
performance overall anyway since you can
spread out too many more of those
available channels so I don't think I'll
be following this up with more
standalone high-end AP videos unless you
guys feel like it's really necessary but
I'm still glad I did this
you know I learned a lot and in spite of
some frustration it was kind of fun to I
hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I
did speaking of things you might enjoy
it's the holiday season and our sponsor
for today's video wants you to have an
AR s x7 pro gaming notebook for
Christmas I mean okay they're not giving
it away or anything but if you're in the
market for a beast super-thin gaming
machine now or maybe right after the
holidays with your Christmas money it is
definitely worth a look it's got top of
the range specs including a core i7 quad
core and dual 970 ends in sli the
performance of which we checked out in
our showdown a little while back which
you can check out here
