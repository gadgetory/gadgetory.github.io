requested many times there's a lot of
anticipation going on yes this is the
unboxing of the AMD FX processor so I've
only got one of them here today but
there are actually a number of different
FX processors so there's the 8 core
fx-8150 which is what I have inside here
at least I think so there's the slightly
slower 8 core FX there's also a 6 core
FX so that's a 6000 series and then
there's also 4 core FX and that's the
4000 series so what FX processors all
have in common is that they are am3+
processor so these are based on the
bulldozer architecture from AMD they are
all unlocked for ultimate overclocking
and I guess that's pretty much it we
have more performance more unlocked CPUs
and just generally a lot of excitement
going on right now on the AMD side so
what I find inside the there we go unbox
oh I mean unlock the world's first 8
core desktop CPU which it is right here
ok maximum performance more cores the
power you crave at every price point
cool innovative architecture so this all
new architecture for maximum flexibility
and efficiency is funny they should
mention that because that is one of the
key things about the bulldozer
architecture so each of those 8 cores is
not necessarily a full core in the
traditional sense but what AMD has
allowed through their creative
engineering is almost eight full cores
of performance by sharing certain
aspects of two cores together ok so two
cores will share sort of one component
that gets used less and then will have
dedicated components so that they can
still spit out most of the performance
of a full core so very very cool stuff
next industry-leading price per
performance that's not really a new
thing we're all used to that on the AMD
side all AMD FX process
are unlocked to allow the maximum
tunable performance so mg is basically
going okay you know what forget the
whole lockdown thing we're going back to
the Athlon XP days folks because every
one of these CPUs you can overclock just
by adjusting the multiplier adjusting
the core voltage and testing for
stability
there is no tuning FSB or tuning base
clock or adjusting Ram dividers or
whatever whatever finicky stuff nope you
take it you turn up the frequency and
then you're happy that's it comes with a
t-shirt at least this kit does and also
comes get this you guys because you love
this with an epic Bell Buckle so I'm
gonna go ahead and show you guys like
how big this here belt buckle
is I mean you know if AMD what if we
didn't already know that AMD is an
Austin texas-based company I think we
know now so there you go alright let's
go ahead and take my first look and
probably one of your first looks
depending when this video comes up at
the AMD FX 8 core 8150 sorry 8150 I
believe yeah 8150 CPU so there's some
seals on here that I'm gonna go ahead
and break got it and this one got it
okay oh there's the CPU
there's CPU I can touch it I can touch
it now it's got plastic over it is okay
experience supercharged responsive
gameplay and mega multitasking
performance with the AMD FX 8 core
processor Black Edition world's first
week or desktop unlocked in
overclockable
and it has an D turbo core technology
which allows the cores to overclock
themselves even if you're not
comfortable overclocking the CPU on your
own in spite of the fact that with an
unlocked CPU overclocking is quite easy
ok please read this first prior to
installing your AMD FX CPU go to your
motherboard manufacturers website and
download the latest bios this is very
very important alright we've got an
instruction manual
inside you'll find a certificate of
authenticity 3-year warranty and
installation instruction
we've got an AMD am-3 plus 8150 cpu
which I'll show you in more detail later
as well as an unlocked FX sticker for
your case and finally we have an auntie
approved
heat sink fan combo made by AVC
evidently hey a pretty nice one too okay
we've got four heat pipes on this guy
and a 60 mil fan and here is a very
fascinating fact for you guys look at
this
does it look familiar this look like
every other AMD heatsink from like the
last five years that is because am3+ is
fully compatible with a.m. 2 a.m. 2 + +
a.m. 3 and even many socket 939 and even
many socket 754 heat sinks so as long as
it can handle the thermal output of the
FX series chip which is actually not
that high by the way it is capable of
fitting on an am3+ board and CPU very
cool alright so let's take out the chip
itself and have a quick look actually
there's something else I want to show
you guys really quick ok open this up so
we have a Prospera board here so this is
part of AMD's 900 series tips and boards
this is made by a soos so there's a
black socket that is an am3+ socket so
if you're not sure if your socket is
am3+ compatible all you have to do is
check the color although there aren't
any natively am3+ motherboards at this
time that are not featuring 900 series
chipsets so that is nine seventy nine
ninety x or nine ninety FX is what
you're going to want what's cool about
these platforms too is andy is really
taking gaming very seriously with this
platform so not only do you have eight
cores of unlocked overclockable goodness
but you've also got full sli and full
crossfire compatibility on the 900
series boards where the manufacturer
licenses those technologies so the
crosshair 5 formula is crossfire ready
sli ready supports dual channel ddr3
memory and
words an eight-core cpu in a single
socket so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the 8150 FX cpu from Andy it
sure does feel good to see that FX badge
on the top of the heat spreader again
