h61 boards that I'm unboxing so the h-60
one is basically like the h 67 except
cheaper so there's a couple small
changes like it only supports two memory
slots
unlike the aged 67 which supports four
and I'm pretty sure there's something
else too oh yeah I don't believe there's
any support for say two three six
gigabit per second which to anyone
buying sort of an el cheapo chipset
board probably doesn't matter that much
so this is a gigabyte board it features
ultra durable pou which is like sort of
last generation ultra durable including
Japanese solid capacitors four plus one
plus one phase power which is pretty
basic I mean that ok let's set our
expectations somewhere realistic for
this board it is 2011 select it uses the
b3 stepping which means that there are
no issues with the SATA 2 ports so that
is really important basically any h61
age 67 p67 board you buy you want to
make sure it's using the b3 stepping and
it features a twice on most Gontier
something spanish which is interesting
because this is something that i pulled
out of our warehouse but i think what
they mean is three year warranty and
that applies to North America as well as
Latin America as far as I know so there
you go nothing different other than the
language here we got dual BIOS as well
as three terabyte plus hard drive
support with hybrid EFI technology which
means it doesn't use a fully UEFI BIOS
but it does have some of the benefits
108 decibel sound to noise ratio okay
three times USB power which is a really
neat feature basically allows gigabyte
boards that feature that feature to
deliver more power to the USB ports
which means if you have multiple devices
plugged into a hob or if you're using a
high-powered device that requires more
energy to charge then a gigabyte board
will be more capable charging it than
another board so here there's a little
warning don't use socket 1156 CPU thanks
gigabyte users manual as well as a
driver of utilities DVD one IO shield
silver Jew SATA cables one right angle
one straight blue and some environments
they friendly cardboard packaging and
finally the motherboard itself so basic
board like this we're not going to find
any fancy-schmancy heat sinks or you
know gaming features or SLI or crossfire
we're going to find a basic board that
does what it sets out to do it is also
kind of a smaller than standard micro
ATX port so you can see it has four
slots like standard m ATX but it's not
as wide as a normal n ATX board let me
grab one just to actually here here's an
ATX board no this is an m-80 export
which is also a no-no this might be a
standard with one now I think this one's
a little bit narrow too okay give me
give me a sec give me a sec your guys
there's a standard width board so that's
an ATX board but they should be the same
width so basically what gigabites doing
is they're saving a little bit of money
on the materials and also making it so
you don't have to put in as many screws
because it's a fairly basic board design
especially now that motherboards don't
really have memory controllers on them
or North bridges there's a lot less
logic so you can easily build it onto a
smaller PCB so let's go and have a look
at the layout so here's our 1155 socket
the 861 chipset does not support any
overclocking so you're not going to need
a whole lot more than the four plus one
phase power design that it is designed
to deliver I mean you can't overclock
okay even if you have an unlocked CPU
you can't overclock it so bear that in
mind
we've also got a four pin power
connector up here in the top left and
it's ideal location we've got two ddr3
memory slots a 24 pin power connector
over here on the right in its ideal
location we have four SATA to three
gigabit per second ports we have one
PCIe 16x slot and it claims ATI
crossfire X although I can tell you guys
now it's not going to perform very well
because you can see that this PCIe 16x
slot is only actually wired up to 4x so
you're not going to get all the
bandwidth to that bottom slot although
apparently it will work in crossfire
mode it should you so desire here we
have two PCI slots which is appropriate
for a board like this because many
people using these entry-level boards
are going to have legacy PCI
bird that they would want to install
your front panel USB is here there's no
USB 3 on this particular motherboard
you've even got look at that you've got
a parallel printer port header so this
is really for the upgrader market
there's your front ports so your power
reset LEDs front panel audio they've
moved it this is a good location for it
compared to up here which we're used to
seeing on gigabyte motherboards in the
past here we go we've got two ps2 ports
once again aimed at that upgrade market
VGA as well as DVI HDMI and DisplayPort
won't be necessary six USB 2 ports so
that coupled with the two headers gives
you a total of 10 USB 2 ports I well I
guess it's Gigabit Ethernet
why don't we double-check that because
uh it's like I said pretty entry-level
so it may not actually be Gigabit
Ethernet so we are going to consult a
user's manual which happens not very
often on my show we're going to find out
yeah Gigabit Ethernet there you go real
tech Gigabit Ethernet and finally 5.1
audio out thank you for checking out
