2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm guys were here at the
BitFenix booth where they have an
unbelievable a number of two of two more
than two unbelievable number of cases on
display so this right here is the Ronin
it's also got what is possibly one of
the most cool things that they're
showing off this is an updated version
of their fan controller so it's touch
screen you can change the color you can
adjust your LED brightness on the fans
you can adjust your LED brightness with
alchemy strips you can adjust your fan
rpms whoa check this out there's
actually an open-source software utility
that lets you also do all that stuff in
the windows OS itself so you can change
the color to whatever you want you can
also go ahead and see ok LED brightness
control mange its turn ziggy's the
little dial very cool not only that but
check out this case so from the side
you'll notice it looks extremely clean
so that's because they've added like a
stealth sort of cover here so even
though it's got a large window you don't
have to stare at the side of your hard
drive cages with all the heck cables
hanging out the back and I'm probably
doing this wrong but thank you I
appreciate that so once you move that
out you've got what looks like otherwise
a fairly standard interior full support
for a 240 millimeter radiator in the top
and then you've got your five at plus-2
but it looks like six hard drive cages
these top ones are removable so if you
need to put in ridiculously long
graphics cards or anything like that you
won't have any difficulty this guy right
here doesn't have a name but you can
sort of see the prodigy heritage of it
and there you go see this is totally
totally pre-production sample so you can
see that's that side I oh who knows if
that even makes it to the final one but
it has a really classy looking chromed
strip all along the top and the bottom
it's got a very very clean front so
single five and a quarter inch Bay again
you see that prodigy heritage here and
then on the left side again with the
chrome strip as well as the ventilated
side for your graphics card who knows
when we're going to see this what it's
going to cost or what the features will
be nobody knows which brings us up
to the Fen mmm this one's quite a bit
more finalized this is going to be an
ITX case that is going to be very very
clean-looking optimized for something
like I don't know you know file server
or if just someone who wants a much more
a much more clean looking computer it's
got again so prodigy based so you see
that same interior with the five drive
cages as well as full support for long
graphics cards if you really wanted to
go that route by removing the top drive
cages which brings us to the Colossus
end this is going to be an M ATX case so
this one right here is going to use you
all hold on a minute so this looks an
awful lot like that sort of that prodigy
heritage as well matx case that's kind
of confusing what in the heck you've
also got adjustable art you've got
adjustable LED so go ahead and see if I
can figure out how to do this can't tell
if they're can't tell if they're working
it's sort of the disadvantage of how
there we go there's a blue LED in the
front there's some different brightness
levels there might be different versions
of the colors who knows but that brings
us to this guy right here so people have
been saying for a bit fair fair while
here well prodigy is a pretty big for an
ITX case why don't you guys try and put
an M ATX board in there bitfenix has
pulled through and they have done
exactly just that so 2 120's in the top
matx inverted motherboard in the back of
the case as well as what appears to be
able to set a 230 millimeter cooling fan
200 millimeters oh yeah no 230
millimeter down in the bottom 230 works
this is a 200 thank you okay we've also
got a 120-millimeter cooling fan in the
back 140 might end up being in the back
hard to say remember guys these cases
are not finished yet and then that mesh
front that we've seen on the black
prodigy already so here I'll just give
you guys another look at that SSD mounts
on the back of the motherboard tray
gives you a fair bit in terms of options
for mounting your drives and I'm
actually not a hundred percent sure
where hard drives are going to go to
hard drives on the bottom of the case
you can actually and I just dropped
something no idea what it was but thank
you if you want to remove that magnetic
strip right there you can actually mount
hard drives with anti vibrational rubber
mounts down there on the bottom and one
more in the back of the pc so this one
right here this has no name this
arrived on Monday so to give you guys
some idea how last minute it was
computech started on Tuesday so it has
no name it has no price what it does
have is a very beautiful ID so ID for
those of you don't know isn't always
identification sometimes it means
industrial design it kind of reminds me
of a seuss's vento chassis from way back
in the day but much classier that thing
was like it kind of bulged out at the
bottom and it was like glossy bright
friggin colors whereas this uses bit
phoenix's classic soft touch feel on the
top as well as the front I don't know if
this front panel even opens like guys
this is there will be a door but this is
a very very early sample absolutely
nothing about it is final but I think it
looks pretty darn nice which brings us
finally to the shadow this one is an
entry-level quiet case so you've got
noise dampening material right here in
the front and you've also got check this
out turn the LEDs in the bottom on and
off and you can also change the color
between red and Lee very very cool stuff
now cases we were expecting from
bitfenix but headsets threw me for a bit
of a loop because that is actually not
something that I was expecting this is
the BitFenix flow headset and what
they've done what they've attempted to
do here is they wanted to build a
headset that is optimal for gaming but
without blowing out the base without
creating that that inevitable problem
that we seem to have with 99% of gaming
headsets out there where they're
optimized to make explosion sound really
rothman really manly but they actually
don't deliver a very satisfying music
listening experience so trying to move
away from that and deliver a more
balanced sound with an ID that you're
going to be comfortable wearing outside
of your house and away from your pee-pee
see where it doesn't really matter if
you look like a total dork now if I
didn't want to look like a total dork
there's a good chance that I shouldn't
have picked the pink one and don't worry
the chain is an optional accessory you
do not actually have to have that no I'm
just kidding this is an anti-theft
device they don't want people walking
away with these so the main features
here are you've got your inline volume
as well as microphone mute and you might
say oh but minus there is no microphone
on that headset well this again is in
line with the concept of having it be
possible
to move away from the pc so see if I can
do this not looking at it that'll be the
test of how good it is there you go so
you can attach the microphone like that
it has a limited amount of adjustment
wouldn't mind seeing something that you
can like really snake around but
honestly for me the problem is that a
lot of headsets have such long boom mics
that they end up sort of right in the
middle of your mouth which is actually
not the optimal placement for them you
want them instead by the corner of your
mouth and that does happen to be where
this ends up on me the headphones
themselves are self adjusting which
means we're normally I would show you
guys the adjustable headband I I can't
really because you put it on your head
and it say I can't even like figure out
how this works without the without
actually putting it on so you put it on
your head and it adjusts to where it's
supposed to sit I like the approach
they've taken with the headphone strap
here because so many times you see
lightweight headbands that compromise on
the material or they compromise on the
amount of padding in order to achieve
the lightweight pneus instead they've
gone with a flexible strip with a little
bit of padding on the inside and kept
the structural integrity parts right
here which are actually made out of what
feels like are these metal with plastic
on the outside yeah metal with plastic
on the outside so you maintain that
lightness without actually adding sort
of like you know chains to them live
without actually adding any bumps that
are going to dig into your head it comes
with a two-stage cable which means you
can leave one end plugged into your PC
so you can see this has quite a short
cable on it I'm going to see if I can
like steal their their ipod here so it
has a short cable but there's another
cable that acts as an extension and
plugs into the back of your PC so you
can just plug it in and go away as you
see fit personally I love these two
stage cables because I don't actually
plug anything into the back of my
computer ever when it comes to
headphones there you go guys there's the
two-stage cable so that means you've got
your split microphone and headphone
jacks here and then you've actually got
eight and then you've actually got a
four pole that's on the microphone
itself that goes into the single adapter
on the other end I prefer this because I
use ah here we go so I'll get you good
look at that I use a DAC as well as a
headphone amp at my computer so having
the option to not have this long cable
loop because I'm never going to actually
run it around to the back of my computer
anyway is really convenient for me
