supercomputer in the country it will be
serving researchers across Canada
budding the human genome in
bioinformatics particle physics
materials research even Humanities
Research
it's called theater it costs the federal
government through the Canadian
Foundation for innovation over 16
million dollars and we get to be the
first to unbox this
savage jerky is created without the use
of nitrates or preservatives use offer
code LTT to save 10% at the link in the
video description so see here is a big
data Musti it takes up a quarter of the
5000 square foot data center it occupies
meaning actually that there's room for
it to grow but right now it has 27,000
Intel Xeon processing cores 190 terabyte
of RAM 64 petabytes of storage 584 GPUs
and a whole power draw of 560 thousand
what though with that said its
efficiency is a shocking 1.07 on the PUA
scale where one would be perfect and a
typical data center would be one and a
half to two we get into how they did
that a little bit later though so our
tour starts right here behind me are
what they call the high availability
rack so everything back there has dual
power supply for redundancy
with a battery backup for that and a
diesel generator backing up that
everything back here is mission-critical
things like networking login servers and
management servers are all here and this
is also where you'll find the bulk of
Peters storage let's get in for a closer
look at Peters connection to the outside
world this networking appliance from
Huawei has a street price of around a
million dollars Wow and right here this
is where it gets really bananas
these guys are cedar is a dual 100
gigabit connection through Vancouver and
then as if that wasn't enough these
orange ones here are dual 40 gigabit
connection
through nearby furry just in case
somebody puts a backhoe through one of
these other fiber lines and they would
have otherwise lost their internet
connectivity I think that's their backup
backup
but Ethernet it's not really the way you
want to connect high-performance
computing those this this right here is
the true networking heart of theater
these are 48 port on the path switches
and they're configured in what's called
an island topology so the island is in
almost all cases 32 compute nodes each
of those compute nodes is connected to
32 ports on one of these switches in its
rack then the remaining 16 ports come
back to here that means that every
island gets a dedicated line to each of
the core switches giving you failover
and massive bandwidth each one of these
fiber links right here is capable of 100
gigabit per second so even though
between islands we are let's say
bottleneck by our 16 connections not
only half the total theoretical speed
within an island we're still talking
over a hundred gigabyte per second so
stops really an issue
ok now let's move on to SFU and compute
canada's versions of petabyte projects
boiler alert there's a better in every
conceivable way so in the five cabinets
behind me we bought Cedars 50 petabytes
IBM tape library system they have a 40
gigabit link to the rest of the
supercomputer and each of the five
thousand ten terabytes magnetic gates
inside can be grabbed out of storage
moved with like a robotic arm into a
reader and the
can be accessed when needed and this is
done automatically cool right
okay yeah but due to the slowness of
that swapping process this is still what
we would consider to be cold or archival
storage next up here is general purpose
storage land where any data that's being
used for any current research project
would be housed so here they're using
off-the-shelf 5u rack each of which
contains if we can crack one open here a
total of two kind of trays here and 84 8
terabytes of public here enterprise
capacity SAS drive from Seagate but
there's actually more to this system
than meets the eye
every 4 of these storage node requires 2
nodes of what they're calling object
storage servers these act as a
high-speed cache with their SAS 10,000
rpm drives as well as kind of like a
traffic cop for everything behind it so
every single read or write to the hard
drive actually goes through these nodes
so right now general Ford land is 10
petabytes but in the mirror mid future
it will be expanding when P and K
now that DIY approach to storage is
great for scaling up at a little cost
but when it comes to performance they
went for this data direct network
storage appliance because it has got the
real good now in the rack next to this
brain will find a mere four petabytes of
actual storage due to its higher cost
but thanks to its proprietary hardware
custom software and solid-state burst
buffers this thing can handle up to 40
gigabytes per second of the same
throughput making it perfect for data
intensive applications that rely on
humongous data set now let's get into
compute there are about half a dozen
different types of compute nodes all
connected to the same high speed on
these half network backbone that are
optimized for different types of
research we'll begin with the base
compute no very whopping 576 of these
each of these is a computer so there's
actually four in a single to you shell
each of which contains two xeon e5 26 83
16 core processors 128 gigs of ram and
about a terabyte of raid 0 SSB storage
for scratch so each rack here contains
two islands so that's a total of 64
compute node giving us a whopping 2048
compute units per rep so these nodes are
the basic workhorse of Peter handling
everything from monte carlo simulations
for material science to simulating
dynamic processes in nature with a high
degree of randomness like no fall or
rainfall they would also be used in any
highly parallelized workload because if
you need you know 10,000
CPU cores for one job there aren't
enough cores and any other class of
servers to handle that kind of load
moving right on up we've got the big
memory nodes there are 48 of these and
half of them are just like the basic
node except with 512 gigs of ram while
the other half of them these copies have
one and a half terabyte of system memory
these ones make up twice as much rack
space though each of these one use is a
single dual pocket system because you
know what there just wasn't enough
gocbar room for all 24 64 gig memory
modules that are required for that much
ram personal problems yes these guys are
really special these are the aptly named
three terabyte notes there are only a
handful of them but these are quadrant
socket machine beyond 48 o9b 4 4 of them
way to pick those are only 8 core
processors these don't even have more
processing cores then those little tiny
ones that pick up half of you what's the
deal here well it turns out that some
file informatics workload like genome
sequencing don't actually scale very
well with more processors they just read
massive amounts of memory to hold the
datasets that they need to work on so
while the team here probably isn't super
stoked on using up for use just so they
can stuff more memory into the system
until Intel octane reaches a higher
level of maturity this is the only
choice they have now finally we're
getting to my favorite notes the most
expensive notes these are the GPU note
and while they're actually quite similar
to the base note with respect to their
CPU and RAM configurations what got the
researchers in the fields of molecular
dynamic AI and machine learning all
amped up about these are the quad nvidia
tesla p 100 graphics cards that they
have crammed into each one i mean
seriously with 1500 watts of power being
consumed by each one of these is it an
innocent engineering marvel that they've
crammed enough power and cooling to make
this whole thing work so actually now
that you think about it how exactly did
they do that
so the key Knight among you might have
already caught a couple of hints earlier
in this video but the secret lies in the
rear doors on the server rack look how
thick this is yes my friends this entire
door is a gigantic meat exchanger so
their servers don't actually have water
blocks that would be more expensive what
they're doing is they've just got the
front of the rack all sealed up so
there's no back rack pressure
and they've got normal air-cooled
servers that pass the air from the front
where they just grow in room temperature
air in here and it comes out hot like
30-plus degrees and push it through the
heat exchanger where it is actually cool
to my skin that how efficient these are
and that cooling system is massively
expendable - you can actually see above
me I am standing where we bought a
blooming green
cooling pipes connected to a whole bunch
of quick-release fittings ready to add
more racks right here but to see what
they actually do with the heat we're
actually going to have to go upstairs
where we'll find the final and perhaps
the coolest stuff in our tours here this
is a mechanical room where the pumps and
these freakin pipes
take all the water from downstairs and
dump it into three cooling towers
outside the building out right now the
weather is favorable to cooling the
ambient temperature is quite low so it's
just operating as gigantic radiators but
get this when the conditions become less
favorable in the summer they kick things
into high gear with an automated system
that sprays water onto the fins of the
radiators in the cooling towers and if
you watched our long cooling video which
you can check out right here you'll be
familiar with this concept already but
this is called evaporative cooling and
by these means even in ambient
temperatures up to 30 degrees Celsius
they can achieve the 17 degree coolant
levels that they need to without
employing the massive chiller unit that
they have over on the other side of the
