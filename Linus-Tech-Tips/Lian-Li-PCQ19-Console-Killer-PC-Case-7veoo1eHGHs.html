got my request for a sample of this case
was wow that's the fastest I've ever
gotten a response after sending out a
product announcement PR email I was on
it like that and why was I so excited
well because I thought the pc q 19
looked like the closest thing that we've
ever gotten to a console killer case
that has you know a very similar form
factor to a next-gen console actually
about the same width and depth as an
xbox one although it is quite a bit
taller and these great modern living
room friendly looks with this gorgeous
brushed aluminum finish speaking of
gorgeous aluminum finish this by the way
we have a video coming on the msi gs70
stealth 17 inch gaming laptop beautiful
aluminum finish anyway make sure you're
subscribed so you don't miss that but
back to this guy did it meet my
expectations well I guess you'll have to
find out after you watch the intro the
Coolermaster neptune 240 m features an
exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more so the PC in cue 19 is the first
case in a while that I haven't actually
been able to figure out how to open just
by looking at it I mean it's beautiful
it's completely clean looking without a
single screw accessible from the front
top bottom and right and left sides it
includes this fantastic aluminum stand
that complements it perfectly and is of
such high quality that I would feel
legitimately bad about using the
included rubber feet to lay it flat and
then hide it in my TV console this case
demands to be shown off upon consulting
the manual which comes in lots of
languages but isn't particularly clearly
written and even contains some errors
like instructing you to unscrew the PCI
Express riser that actually ends up
coming in a baggy not screwed in I
discovered that you just pop the side
panels off they use a similar mechanism
to the BitFenix pandora and I was ready
with my red marker to take off points
for this because with the Pandora we
actually had problems keeping the side
panel
until I tried to take these ones off and
realized we are dealing with a whole
different grade of pushpins here so full
marks for these side panels leanly
I mean let me tell you those sockets you
wouldn't want to put your penis in there
you'd never get it back inside the case
it's classic Lindley everything is made
of the usual wonderfully finished
aluminum that keeps the case lightweight
and classy looking keeps your fingers
and cables safe from cuts and enable
some incredibly creative designs without
the sales volume requirements that cases
with plastic chassis components require
motherboard and power supply mounting
was pretty simple at first remove both
panels and all the removable bits the
power supply takes an air directly from
the side and exhausted out the back I
used a 600 watt Silverstone SFX modular
power supply and the motherboard sits on
a nice rigid you know support structure
thing that gives really easy access to
the back of the board for easy cooler
installation and then I hit a potential
snag and a real one first I noticed that
the ATX connector doesn't fit through
the hole into the bottom compartment if
it's a full 24 pin design without the
four detachable pins but mine has four
breakaway pins so that was okay and then
I realized that not one combination of
the Mini ITX boards and sfx power
supplies that I owned would allow the 24
pin connector to reach the plug so I had
to use a 24 pin extension fortunately I
had one lying around and there's a fair
bit of room in the front of the case to
store the now extra length that I had to
deal with actually had the opposite
problem as well with the front USB three
header so the cable wasn't long enough
to route around my CPU cooler and it had
to sit over top but that was that was a
minor issue and everything else here was
fine drive mounting is solid with anti
vibrational mounts in the three tuna
half-inch locations and one three and
1/2 inch location and cable management
was mostly easy with the only potential
snafu being the spacing of the two
stacked two and a half inch drives
making an adapter if your power supply
has left or right angle SATA connectors
also of note while you guys are watching
the b-roll is
one of the drives is in the correct
location but not actually screwed in
don't don't mind that it does screw in
there if you're not lazy I just threw
that in after I was done building now I
was very pleased to see these sick
magnetic fan filters over the
motherboard and flour supply areas flour
supply filtered intakes are a very very
good thing but I was pretty disappointed
to see how poorly planned the cases
airflow strategy was in general the 120
millimeter fan behind the top filter
needed to be turned around to keep the
cases internal pressure positive so that
you're forcing dust out of the little
gaps in the case rather than into them
drawing in dust check out this video to
learn more about this concept and the
graphics card mounting while it's super
sweet with this PCIe riser card and
compatibility with up to 24 centimeter
graphics cards plenty of room for
gigabytes new ITX GTX 970 by the way
it's just kind of like the cable cut out
only being suitable for low-end 20-pin
ATX connectors I mean it's it's in there
rather than feeling like it's an
important part of the case design and
that lie cleanly actually expects anyone
to put a high end card in the case any
dual slot cooler design is obviously
going to start for fresh air with a
blower style putting the fam right up
against a non perforated side panel and
an open design simply scattering hot air
around at the CPU in the nearby hard
drive which leads into both my
conclusion about this case and I guess a
bit of a rant
it's a beautiful case I can never fault
me in these craftsmanship but
unfortunately it's more geared towards
light in middle weight media PC use and
it's not what I wanted as someone who
wants to see a proper console killer
case truthfully even though I like the
case that's making it really hard for me
to give it a positive conclusion here
because it just feels like such a missed
opportunity given that even the lowly
7850 that I have in there runs at 81
degrees on the cpu at 87 percent fan
speed and we're talking about 110 TDP
card here 110 watt excuse me and the
thing that makes me most upset about all
of this is that the case that I
wanted this to be should already exist
or be due for release very soon ten
months ago I met with Nathan from
Coolermaster and I'm calling you out
buddy and gave him my idea for how we
could take actually a very similar
design to this one obviously before this
came out so it was innovative at the
time but with the motherboard on top
no three and a half inch drive mounting
points you'll rely on SSDs or two and a
half inch hard drives the graphics card
on a flexible PCIe extension on the
bottom so the intake would be on the
same side as the CPU intake and an
external brick style power supply set up
maybe with dual bricks or something like
that I've seen this done before now as
well as soos with their latest ROG thing
g20 or something like that and then so
the idea was that we'd be able to get a
full custom adequately pooled ITX gaming
PC into a form factor about the size of
the ps4 but they've been sitting on
their asses for almost a year now with
this idea so I'm putting the idea out in
public now guys let me and coolermaster
know in the comments if you want to see
something like that because if it turned
out well that is the kind of thing that
I would love to do like a sick Linus
edition case of or something like that
anyway good case not what I expected
thank you guys for watching like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment letting me
