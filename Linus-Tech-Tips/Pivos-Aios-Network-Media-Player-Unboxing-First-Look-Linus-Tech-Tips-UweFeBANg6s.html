player box to unbox and this is from a
new brand that most of you probably
aren't familiar with but based on what I
know about the company and the people
involved I am I have very high
expectations for this particular product
so let's have a look at what we've got
on the front here in terms of features
so it's HD ready full 1080p ok supports
hard drives up to 3 terabytes
we have optional optional the ability to
add wireless-n okay we've got Gigabit
LAN USB 3 that's a cool feature supports
blu-ray disc ISOs very nice 5.1 and 7.1
are both supported supports UPnP as well
as DLNA we have support for sub titles
including srt SMI and SS a we can
download files from HTTP SMB or FTP it
says all in one here and what I think
they mean is in terms of a file format
so they got TS and kV Emily and PEG all
of that on there it has a browser it
supports web TV it supports BitTorrent
and supports RSS so this is the AOS
from pibbles let's go around to the back
it supports USB wired or wireless
keyboard and mouse here's a bunch of the
services that it can be used with this
little unit right here including Picasa
Flickr YouTube html5 Google Talk Yahoo
alright moving right along the box the
box that brings you the best of HD so
the AOS HD media centers a full 1080p HD
playback capability combined with the
latest surround sound and digital audio
technology provide the best in home
entertainment experience for you and
your family can share files via
connected storage devices network or
Google Talk with an intuitive file
management system plays the most popular
media file formats that include ISO
blu-ray ISO with navigation and many
many more streams online media ok plays
from anywhere play your favorite video
audio photo files from USB storage flash
media external storage network attached
storage or networked computers connects
the web and your friends so you can
actually sit on your TV on your couch
watching your TV and you can use Google
Talk or whatever else and you can
download the Bluetooth up
yeah because BT means Bluetooth
this context BitTorrent files like I
said I mean the boxes for these Network
media players can say whatever they want
but at the end of the day it's gonna
come down to the software and like I
said from what I know about the team
behind this one I have very high
expectations for this box all right so
let's pull out the unit itself and put
it aside for now and then I'm gonna go
ahead and have a look in here at what
we've got in terms of accessories so
first thing we find is a very large
remote so unlike some of the bare-bones
remote you see with these Network media
players this guy's thought all of the
numbers we could want oh you can well
it's not like record button oh this
stuff here going on okay so I'm not
gonna go too much in detail about which
buttons are on there but you can feel
free to start of here I'm gonna get in
close and then just do like a pan shot
at everything that's on the controller
okay runs off double-a batteries pardon
me triple-a batteries and it comes with
a couple of triple-a batteries for you
to use next we have a power brick pretty
standard looking power brick nothing out
of the ordinary here and a power cable
for the power brick plugs into the brick
and powers the box finally we have a USB
3 cable and that oh okay that's handy so
the USB 3 cable presumably plugs into
the AOS unit itself and allows you to
yeah to plug into your PC and transfer
files to the internal hard drive that
you've installed very nice very nice
feature so you'll be able to transfer
things much faster than competing
players we've also got a composite cable
which I would definitely not recommend
you use we've got a couple of hard drive
screws but yeah you should definitely
use HDMI with a unit like this it is HD
ready after all
here's your user guide including how to
install a hard drive connect things to
it stream by the UPnP all that good
stuff so that you can see everything
that's in there alright and next we have
a Quick Start Guide get acquainted
what's in the box how to connect it to
various things including your router
your nas all that good stuff tips tips
and more tips
and let's have a look at the unit itself
so the front of it is a very sort of
clean slick professional look it's
glossy on the front and then it's got
kind of a brushed aluminum brushed metal
finish on the sides here it's got a
little readout for time a little readout
indicating that is playing back there's
a USB connection
there's your IR receiver for the remote
on the top you can see we've got a
brushed metal finish there as well very
professional look for AV equipment look
at that look how easy it is to install
hard drive wow that's cool so all you do
is you throw the drive in with these two
pegs and the right spots and then you
put one screw here and one screw here
and slide the oops you gotta be right
side up to do that and slide the whole
thing back into the unit yeah very easy
cool I think I did it wrong yeah after
all that I did it wrong again
there we go that's how it goes back in
nice and flush this time okay so moving
along to the other side not a whole lot
going on there we got rubberized feet on
the bottom once again very nice brushed
finish overall to the unit there's a USB
2.0 port didn't see that before so that
you can just have this at the front of
your media center you can go ahead and
plug a USB stick in there or whatever
the case may be and you can easily play
off a USB stick now in terms of output
options you've actually got a very wide
variety on this unit because of its a
slightly larger size than some competing
solutions that gives you a little bit
more room on the back for different
options so you've actually got component
composite coax and optical digital audio
out LAN here this is Gigabit LAN mind
you two more USB 2.0 ports so that was
the one on the front and two on the back
HDMI out USB three for transferring
files to the internal hard drive that
you can optionally install finally power
in and an on/off switch it does have a
fan and I hopefully I'll have a chance
to let you guys know if it gets loud but
I wouldn't really expect it to there's
not not too much in here that you need
to have
like a tornado style fan going on in
order to get the full functionality out
of the machine so we actually give me
one moment guys so I missed one other
handy feature there's actually an SDHC
reader on the other side of the unit
opposite the USB 2.0 port so if you take
a video on your camera for example and
you want to show it to everyone you go
ahead you take your video you pop it out
you throw it in there and now you can
play it back so with the included html5
browser you can access all the best
content on the internet with your
network share capabilities you can
actually access all the content that's
on here from elsewhere including your
other computers at home with the file
with the network browsing on the unit
itself you can access files that are
elsewhere on your network and finally
you can access files that are put on the
internal hard drive so it's a very fully
featured network media player and I hope
to have some time to check it out in the
near future thanks for watching my
