player box to unbox and this is from a
new brand that most of you probably
aren't familiar with but based on what I
know about the company and the people
involved I am I have very high
expectations for this particular product
so let's have a look at what we've got
on the front here in terms of features
so it's HD ready full 1080p ok supports
hard drives up to three terabytes we
have optional optional the ability to
add wireless n okay we've got Gigabit
LAN USB 3 that's a cool feature supports
blu ray disc ISOs very nice 5.1 and 7.1
are both supported supports upnp as well
as DLNA we have support for subtitles
including srt SMI in SS a we can
download files from HTTP SMB or ftp it
says all in one here and what I think
they mean is in terms of a file format
so TS and kV Emily and PEG all of that
on there it has a browser it supports
webtv it supports BitTorrent and
supports RSS so this is the AOS from
pipo's let's go around to the back it
supports USB wired or wireless keyboard
and mouse here's a bunch of the services
that it can be used with this little
unit right here including Picasa Flickr
YouTube html5 google talk yahoo all
right moving right along the box the box
that brings you the best of HD so the
AOS HD media centers a full 1080p HD
playback capability combined with the
latest surround sound and digital audio
technology provide the best in home
entertainment experience for you and
your family can share files via
connected storage devices network or
google talk with an intuitive file
management system plays the most popular
media file formats that include iso
blu-ray I so with navigation and many
many more streamed online media okay
plays from anywhere play your favorite
video audio photo files from USB storage
flash media external storage network
attached storage or networked computers
connects the web and your friends so you
can actually sit on your TV are on your
couch watching your TV and you can use
google talk or whatever else and you can
download bluetooth up yeah because BTW
means blue too
this context bit torrent files all right
let's open up the box and have a look at
the fat like I said I mean the boxes for
these network media players can say
whatever they want but at the end of the
day it's going to come down to the
software and like I said from what I
know about the team behind this one have
very high expectations for this box
alright so let's pull out the unit
itself and put it aside for now and then
i'm going to go ahead and have a look in
here at what we've got in terms of
accessories so first thing we find is a
very large remote so unlike some of the
bare-bones remote you see with these
network media players this guy's thought
all of the numbers we could want ah you
can sound like record button all this
stuff here going on okay so I'm not
going to go too much in detail about
which buttons are on there but you can
feel free to start here I'm going to get
in close and then just do like a pan
shot of everything that's on the
controller okay runs off double A
batteries pardon me triple a batteries
and it comes with a couple triple-a
batteries for you to use next we have a
power brick pretty standard looking
power brick nothing out of the ordinary
here and a power cable for the power
brick plugs into the brick and powers
the box finally we have a USB three
cable and that oh okay that's handy so
the USD free cable presumably plugs into
the AOS unit itself and allows you to ya
to plug into your PC and transfer files
to the internal hard drive that you've
installed very nice very nice feature so
you'll be able to transfer things much
faster than competing players we've also
got a composite cable which I would
definitely not recommend you use we've
got a couple hard drive screws but yeah
you should definitely use HDMI with a
unit like this it is hd-ready after all
here's your user guide including how to
install a hard drive connect things to
it stream by the upnp all that good
stuff so hope that you can see
everything that's in there alright and
next we have a quick start guide get
acquainted what's in the box how to
connect it to various things including
your router your nas all that good stuff
tips tips and more
tips and let's have a look at the unit
itself so the front of it is a very sort
of clean slick professional look oh it's
glossy on the front and then it's got
kind of a brushed aluminum brushed metal
finish on the sides here it's got a
little readout for time little readout
indicating that is playing back there's
a USB connection there's your IR
receiver for the remote on the top you
can see we've got a brushed metal finish
there as well very professional look for
AV equipment look at that look how easy
it is to install hard drive well that's
cool so all you do is you throw the
drive in with these two pegs in the
right spots and then you put one screw
here and one screw here and slide the
oops you got to be right side up to do
that and slide the whole thing back into
the unit yeah very easy cool I think I
did it wrong yeah after all that I did
it wrong again there we go that's how it
goes back in nice and flush this time
okay so moving along to the other side
not a whole lot going on there we got
rubberized feet on the bottom once again
very nice brushed finish overall to the
unit there's a USB 2.0 port didn't see
that before so that you can just have
this at the front of your media center
you can go ahead and plug a USB stick in
there or whatever the case may be and
you can easily play off a USB stick now
in terms of output options you actually
got a very wide variety on this unit
because of its slightly larger size than
some competing solutions that gives you
a little bit more room on the back for
different options so you've actually got
component composite coax and optical
digital audio out LAN here this is
Gigabit LAN mind you two more USB 2.0
ports so that was the one on the front
and two on the back hdmi out USB 3 for
transferring files to the internal hard
drive that you can optionally install
finally power in and an on/off switch it
does have a fan and I hopefully I'll
have a chance to let you guys know if it
gets loud but I wouldn't really expect
it to there's not not too much
in here that you need to have like a
tornado style fan going on in order to
get the full functionality out of the
machine so we actually give me one
moment guys so I missed one other handy
feature there's actually an SDHC reader
on the other side of the unit opposite
the USB 2.0 port so if you take a video
on your camera for example and you want
to show it to everyone you go ahead you
take your video you pop it out you throw
it in there and now you can play it back
so with the included html5 browser you
can access all the best content on the
internet with your network share
capabilities you can actually access all
the content that's on here from
elsewhere including your other computers
at home with the file with the network
browsing on the unit itself you can
access files that are elsewhere on your
network and finally you can access files
that are stored on the internal hard
drive so it's a very fully featured
network media player and I hope to have
some time to check it out in the near
future thanks for watching my unboxing
