something together we made an SSD out of
a bunch of micro SD cards and this PCB
we bought off some Chinese site
it was super dumb overall I'd say it was
a waste of both time and money but not
to be deterred by little things like bat
we are back at it again with another DIY
memory product today we will be making
our own USB thumb drive will it be
awesome or will it be awful I'll let you
know after I tell you about the zotac
mech 1 a compact desktop PC built for
gaming and featuring a sleek robotic
style design you can check it out at the
link below
okay so we've cleared away everything
that we don't immediately need so let's
go ahead and crack open an MS o9 this is
a brand new one haven't used it yet come
comes with a little screwdriver little
screw comes with a little enclosure
that's about it so there are other MDOT
two enclosures on the market
that let you turn a regular drive into
an SSD but what we like about this one
is that it doesn't require an external
power cable in addition to the USB plug
on it and it's got kind of a actually
it's got kind of a nice sort of aluminum
sandblasted finish on I mean everything
Silverstone does kind of has a nice
aluminum sandblasted finish on it but
that's not that's not a terrible thing
to be known for this assembly fairly
straightforward oh my goodness
this piece pushes this piece which has
little nubbins that stick into the PCB
it's the whole PCB that slides back and
forth that is a that is not the least
janky mechanism I have ever seen in
their defense maybe they all work that
way I don't know I haven't taken apart a
whole lot of USB drives but that doesn't
seem like the best solution all right
now let's go ahead and get our MDOT to
installed we picked a random m2 that we
had on the shelf downstairs you can't
quite go full random this particular
drive right here is not compatible with
nvme m2 SSD so that means that you
either have to use one with a B key or a
B+ M key so as long as it's one that is
SATA or AHCI and it should say that
somewhere on the SSD and it's 40 to 60
or 80 millimeters long it should
theoretically both fit and function the
other decision we have to make with
respect to our SSD is which size to go
with so we went with a 500 gig for a
couple of reasons
so yeah this little guy just kind of
goes on here again this is not this is
not the most amazing mounting system
I've ever seen this screw goes in here
then reason number one was that we
figured by the time you're spending 35
bucks on just the the raw PCB and
enclosure to make your own USB Drive
you probably want something that's got
more capacity than the you know
commodity one that they were handing out
at the last convention you were at and
number two we wanted to see the best
possible performance out of our DIY
drive and higher capacity drives do have
a tendency to perform a little bit
better than the lower ones and you can
actually get a full explanation for why
that is in the tech quickie video up
here oh wow
why is there an extra screw anywho with
all of that said I'm still not expecting
to get anywhere near the speeds
advertised on the Box turn gigabit per
second because of an inherent limitation
of the product an aged CI or a SATA m2
SSD can only go as high as six gigabit
so at best the benefit we're getting
from a Gen 2 chipset is another gigabit
per second but I mean hey any benefit is
a benefit and I'll take it it's got some
performance tests going it's got some
performance tests going ok so let's meet
all of our contestants I'm gonna have
this guy plugged in here just for
convenient size comparison as we as we
go through let's start with a regular
old USB Drive you can see by comparison
it takes up very little of the space
around it and doesn't stick out nearly
so far off the back of the system
obviously now in terms of our tests
we're gonna keep things pretty simple
today and just copy a 10 gig file to and
from our drives now this would not be a
suitable test if this was a boot SSD but
because these are just external drives
and this is absolutely the intended use
case it's perfectly acceptable in this
context alright so out of boat 55
megabytes per second right
and just shy of a hundred and forty
megabytes per second reads even our
commodity drive is definitely taking
advantage of USB 3 versus USB 2 but it's
a low capacity drive and those right
speeds if you actually had you know a
500 gig drive would be pretty painful if
it was a drive that you used very
frequently to fill up and then offload
data from because it would take you over
two and a half hours to fill a 500 gig
drive at these speeds even if the
offload is not nearly so bad almost
three times as fast let's plug in to
travel to the GT now if you were gonna
actually plug this directly into the
back of your computer even with the
skinniest possible device you can see
I'm nowhere near being able to put that
in there I actually can't even access
the ones next to it on this side and
even the type C port I cannot get into
if there's like any sleeve whatsoever on
the cable here so yeah that's why they
include this thing so you can hang it
off the back of your drive okay that's
not bad right speeds are a little slow
but read speeds are very good at over
350 Meg's a second so if it weren't for
the cost and that it's just not much
more convenient of a form factor
compared even to an external drive with
a dongle this would be a lot more
compelling for our next trick we've got
the t5 portable SSD now this has the
advantage of easy access to all the
ports around it and even the ability to
use different connectors like if you
wanted a type C a type C like the one
that I have right here but the drawback
is that you always need a cable that was
faster than I was expecting
that is more like I was expecting wait
no also very very fast how did James get
those other
results our pre video preparation failed
us
we still had write caching enabled for
this drive so let's go ahead and change
that which for some reason requires a
restart we'll be right back and thanks
to the magic of video editing we are
back immediately that is more like what
I was expecting actually that's still
better than I was expecting but this is
within the realm of possibility
so with results like that it's no
mystery why these things have gotten so
popular let's find out if our DIY SS the
USB solution can compare Oh interesting
so it shows up as the WD SSD but a USB
device how cool not bad and read speeds
are really good these are actually the
best results we've seen so far Wow not
too shabby bottom line then you do lose
out on the ability to install regular
USB S or even type C's with the extra
space afforded by them on either side of
it but you can easily put something even
something fairly bulky right above it if
you don't mind them kind of going like
this a bit and in terms of performance
per dollar with our HCI MDOT - it
actually looks not bad oh it should be
noted that your mileage may vary if you
put a slower or cheaper drive in here
maybe you ended up getting one of these
because you had an MDOT to drive lying
around from before an upgrade or
something like that then your results
will be different but from our
perspective the big winners are really
well honestly everything but this cuz
these are cheap and like kind of good
enough this is really compact and offers
pretty darn good performance but comes
at a price premium for its compactness
this has a dongle but performs really
well and is very affordable by
comparison and then this is flexible
big a little bulky but highly
configurable and also reasonably
affordable tunnel bear tunnel bear is
