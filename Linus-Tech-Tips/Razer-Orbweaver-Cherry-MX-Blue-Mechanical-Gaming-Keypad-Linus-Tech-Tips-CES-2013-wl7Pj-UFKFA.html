out the orb weaver this is a very
premium we're talking over a hundred
dollars dedicated game pack
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Vince's it offers some functionality
that a keyboard just plain can't because
of the ergonomics of a gamepad like this
now they've also taken some of the
design concepts that came from newer
products like the Ouroboros in terms of
allowing better ergonomics depending on
the size and shape of your hands so what
makes this a premium gamepad well it's
got green LED backlights it's got a
beautiful matte finish other than that
check this out guys Cherry MX blue
switches all over the place these are
all fully custom key caps so that you
can comfortably reach all of them and it
is fully mechanical even the d-pad on
the side right here is mechanical it is
eight way mechanical so it's not kind of
an emulated in between diagonals no it
actually has dedicated diagonals it's
fully compatible with synapse 2.0 which
means you can program any key to do
anything you want to whether it's just
remapping it whether it's a macro you
can even it even has a shift
functionality so if you want more than
20 fully programmable keys you can go
shift over here and program another set
of 20 key functions so you can do 40
things with this gamepad alone which is
very very impressive now I want to show
you guys how the adjustability works
down here you got a couple little
buttons you got one right here so you
can pop this out there's four settings
from XL l medium small and then this guy
right here as a button that slides out
in four settings right here the unit is
extremely well built overall and it
feels very solid which is good because
the gaming peripherals can get thrown
around a little bit and it has look at
this this is a rubber surface these are
rubber surfaces these are rubber
surfaces you put this thing down
it's
not going anywhere I'm pushing on it
really hard okay so there you go
adjustability wise so I'm gonna put it
down as low as it goes there you go
I can reach comfortably I can reach t3 I
can reach 18 no problem now what we're
gonna do is we're gonna put slicks hand
on this thing yeah that's not gonna work
that's not gonna fly folks no not gonna
work okay so we're gonna go ahead gonna
expand it for his baseball mitts slick
tell me what you think now that's a lot
better there we go
that's more like it so it actually will
work no matter what your hand size is
and I'm just trying to think if there's
any uh yes I'm missing one more thing
about the customizability this pin right
here pop that out and you can actually
adjust the positioning of the palm or
the inside of your palm rest as well so
if you want a more flat profile where as
you could see the way slick held it was
more like this I would probably hold it
more flat however you can even put it in
free play mode by simply pulling out the
pin and then you can adjust it so
however you want and just have it just
sit there and well I already called it
free play mode and that's what it's
called so I don't have another word for
it I think that pretty much covers
everything that we can say about the orb
weaver from Razer don't forget to check
