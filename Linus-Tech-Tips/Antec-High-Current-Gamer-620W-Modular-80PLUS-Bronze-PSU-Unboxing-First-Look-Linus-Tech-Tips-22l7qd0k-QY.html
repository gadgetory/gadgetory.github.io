high-current gamer m 620 watt for man
text so this is once again a bit of a
departure for man text traditional style
of not focusing as much on modular power
supplies to the point where now they are
focusing more on modular power supplies
I am a huge advocate of modular power
supplies yes there are drawbacks such as
for example they are slightly less
efficient due to the modular interfaces
on the inside although there are been
advances there as well as due to the
cable connections that will slightly
reduce the efficiency of the power
supply however I believe the benefits
far outweigh the drawbacks
so I yes I like wonder the power
supplies I'm happy to see an tech move
in this direction with their PS use this
particular unit we're gonna find a bunch
of interesting stuff about it on the
outside so one is that it uses a one
hundred thirty-five millimeter dual ball
bearing fan this is another huge
improvement that an Tek has made over
the last couple of generations where
they went from using 80 mill fans on
their high end power supplies to using
almost all 120 plus millimeter fans
thumbs up all ntek power supplies are
rated for continuous power so not peak
power not burst power not like the fairy
dust power continuous power high current
cable management okay that much is good
and fairly evident Universal input okay
let's find if we can see anything high
current output okay 12 volt single rail
very nice single 12 volt rail okay
ATX this advanced hybrid cable
management continuous power well this is
all stuff that we've already seen before
my hot japanese brand capacitors it is
80 plus bronze certified which is also
kind of nice as well so remember 80 plus
bronze is a step above 80 plus and a
step below 80 plus silver so most sort
of mid-range power supplies are 80 plus
bronze these days and the advantage of
80 plus in general the higher you go in
terms of 80 plus remember and
Tech has products ranging all the way up
to 80 plus platinum with their high
current bro website high current pro
1000 which has a max efficiency of 94% I
mean you can hardly call it 80 plus and
that means more like almost 90 plus so
you do have a wide variety of options
this is just one of them with 80 plus
bronze so let's have a look at me in it
itself on the side we see pretty much
your sort of standard like you know it's
got a label and it has an end text down
fine actually this has a pretty high
quality paint finish on it - that's nice
it's one of those little things right
where it has a bit of a texture to it so
it's not going to be easy to scratch
which is really important because one of
the first things that you can do to
totally bork a power supply is go ahead
and like install it this way and then
realize that all the cables don't reach
and then you flip it over install the
other way only to realize that the top
of it is all covered and scratches from
putting it in the case so if you have a
high quality paint finish on the unit
then you don't have to worry about that
as much I mean you the flip side of that
is you could just be careful but you
know not everyone's careful all the time
so write label one hundred thirty-five
millimeter dual ball bearing fan with a
very aggressive very high pressure
looking blade design actually that looks
just like beastly what kind of fan is
there it's an add a fan fascinating
nothing looks beautiful okay an tech
design continuous power since 1986 and
tech is officially about as old as I am
okay you can see on the other side how
would you normally install this so oh
that's a shame okay so an attack hasn't
figured out the whole like label going
the other way thing unfortunately so if
you were to install this in a bottom
mounted system well even if in a pop
mounted system no matter what if you
were installed this way this label would
unfortunately be upside down I mean I
guess you could peel it off and put it
back on but you can also put it this way
all right here you see the general
general specs and stats so we have up to
forty eight amps on a single 12 volt
rail and is 80 plus bronze this is all
stuff that we have pretty much covered
already the 12 volt max load is 576 watt
so that means this particular power
supply design does have actual dedicated
circuitry for the 3.3 volt and 5.5
rales it is not just converting 12-volt
in order to get those other voltage
output now let's have a look oh you know
what we didn't even cover the
environmentally-friendly packaging this
is one of those things that some people
might not care about but personally I
think context is right to be making an
effort to do this kind of stuff so they
have found a way to pack it to almost
all of their power supplies these days
in corrugated cardboard instead of using
phones that don't biodegrade and will
pretty much still be there when your
grandkids and your great grandkids are
throwing away their styrofoam hopefully
have a better solution by then but yeah
and this is also made of like a papery
material so all of this stuff is
relatively environmentally friendly when
you compare it to super heavy on the
styrofoam and plastic packaging
solutions from competitors so we don't
have a ton of included cables I wouldn't
have minded seeing a few more of these
but we've got one triple molex cable
these are all Hey look at this this is
using their um shoot what do they call
it hold on I have to cheat some kind of
like stealth cable something or
something like that
stealth wires yes all wires darkened for
minimal visibility so an Tek is all
about they're very by-the-book like as a
company these guys are just like like
by-the-book kind of rigid I mean not in
a bad way but what they basically were
like it's like oh well our competitors
are doing cables with all black wires
well we don't believe in that because
it's not safe because there's a chance
at the factory or when an end-user is
Reese leaving the cable or whatever else
for these wires to be mixed up now what
an tech solution to that is is wires
that are half colored and half black so
check this out see yellow on the one
side black on the other side so what
that means is when you wrap them in
sleeving they look almost pure black
because they're only half colored
compared to having full colored cables
inside but antec maintains that same
standard of safety and consistency that
they strive for so it's one of the it's
it's interesting things like that where
you know you see that that rigidity that
unwillingness to to bend on something
like a safety standard but with the
adaptability where they want to go okay
but we need to address this need in the
market for our cables to look
exercise that's kind of cool it's kind
of a neat story when you when you hear
about it
thermal manager in advance low voltage
fan control for optimally knoweth
management up to ninety two point nine
percent power available on the 12 volt
rail but also remiss in here stealth
wires and tech quality three year
limited warranty on all partisan labor
as well as full speed of industrial
grade protections you can actually I
mean if you google around the nook you
can find plenty of incidents of other
brands of power supplies just like
catastrophic lee failing especially over
current protection is the big one all
anti power supplies actually have over
current protection not all of their
competitors even some of the bigger
names that you might not expect to do
have over current protection so moving
on right we have one with three molexes
one with three molexes and a floppy in
case you still have something that uses
that whether it's a card reader or
whatever else we have a power cable that
has included a nice flexible one it
seems to be reasonably high quality for
installation screws wouldn't mind if
those were black but I guess it's not
the end of the world 3theta cables there
are three SATA connectors on one cable
three SATA connectors on another more
different cable and finally two PCIe six
plus two pin cables so you can connect
up to one high end graphics card or two
fairly low end graphics cards like sort
of 7770 class we have a 24 pin cable
effectively a nice thin thin connector
also using their stealth wire so you can
see that is so much less obtrusive than
then like the more traditional you know
what I should look around and I should
see if I can find like a more
traditional approach to power supply he
says this one well I guess that's easy
Axios power supply so you can see the
wide variety of colors that are
available in there mind you they've done
a pretty good job of sleeping it right
to the end anyway so okay let's go back
and moving right along to the last one
we have a nice long approximately let's
see it's about one Linus farm length
four plus four pins so that's good for
your CPU power connector so this is a
six twenty one power supply you won't be
powering any high-end dual graphics
configurations and you won't be powering
any high end
dual CPU configurations so the one thing
I wouldn't mind seeing improved is maybe
one more one more
SATA connector something along those
lines that would be that would be kind
of nice to see but other than that it's
not the end of the world this is cool
dope check this out
so in order to give you lots of options
an tech has allowed you to either go for
very few peripherals and four PCIe
cables although you'd have to source
your own cables I'm trying to check that
out so we can put in our two PCIe cables
and then they've given you this sort of
modularity where you can go okay well
hey what if I only have one graphics
card but I want to have like for
peripheral connectors well what you can
do is you can plug them in here or you
can plug them in here so they give you
the option to use the connectors the
modular the modular sockets for
whichever cables you want which is
pretty neat on the back you find your
traditional honeycomb as well as your
on/off switch and your power input and I
think that pretty much covers it thank
you for checking out my unboxing your
first look at the high current gamer M
from an tech this is the 620 watt
version all those is available in a
couple of different wattage capacities
