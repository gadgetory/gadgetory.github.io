believe the second fanless power supply
that I have unboxed but what's really
special about this one is the fact that
it achieves its fanless design not by
the use of extremely heavy heat sinks
but rather through incredible efficiency
so this is a 400 watt unit from C sonic
and it is 80 plus gold certified we're
starting to see more and more 80 plus
gold certified power supplies but this
is the first one that uses that
incredible efficiency now remember
efficiency means how much power it can
produce versus how much excess random
heat that it outputs so it uses that
efficiency to output so little heat that
it can just run without a fan at all so
you can see here we have a summary of
the connectors always this is also
really cool single 12 volt 33 amp rail
so this is a single rail design 80 plus
gold fanless power supply let's have a
look at the back here so see sonic has a
slightly different design for the output
okay you know I'll just let you look at
the diagram because I haven't really
studied that ahead ton ahead of time but
basically what they're able to do is by
keeping the amperage is lower within the
power supply overall they're able to
lose less efficiency that way so they
have high current gold-plated terminals
I guess we can start the unboxing now
high reliability 105 degree rated
capacitors conductive okay so solid
solid capacitors and a five-year
warranty on this unit is fanless zero
decibels so this would be great for a
media PC or this would be great for
almost any PC because the reality of it
is if you're running a single graphics
card like single PCI b6 in or a pin
connector and you're running like almost
any almost a CPU on the market like if
you just need a computer with like good
CPU lots of RAM you throw an SSD in
there a hard drive in there and you
don't need like a high-end video car
anything like that this is like perfect
because you can just have perfect
silence for your power supply and 400
watts really is enough for almost any PC
unless you start throwing like
overclocking and high-end graphics cards
into the mix so far is that okay and
only should operate in a well-designed
system chassis that provides good
ventilation for modern computer
components so you don't want to throw
this in a sealed box is basically what
they're saying need to use a proper case
that has probably at least one fan in it
to provide some incidental airflow to
your power supply so here's a summary of
some of the extra features while special
features gets all of two pages in this
in this manual out of eight in English
so go ahead and pause the video and read
through that if you so desire alright
here we are a little bit more about it
their whole x-series so it goes all the
way from 400 watt for fanless units all
the way up to 1200 Watts just incredible
let me see warranty and disclaimers or
safety notes very nice just a modular
power supply dude look at that
modular okay Cinci sonic cable ties very
nice we get some zip ties and then we
get a nice little C Sonic sticker
powered by C Sonic alright let's have a
look at the power supply first for a
change I don't really look at the cables
first but we're gonna do it the other
way around
next sticker there very many sticker
feels like quality okay so I actually
don't have my tripod propped against me
today so maybe I'll just pause the video
for a second alright as soon as we take
the power supply out of the satiny
sleeve that it comes packed in we see a
sticker on top with that says install
with the ventilation top cover facing up
and please remove this label before use
so let's go around to the side where we
also have some more ventilation here at
the front we have the modular interface
we're gonna go ahead and remove that
label on the other side we have some
more ventilation holes so I guess
presumably the way this works is simply
by a convection so as components in here
heat up the heat gets
exhausted out here just because of the
simple fact that he does rise and then
see sonic has strategically placed the
intake holes which are presumably at the
back and here along the sides so that
and the front so that the air comes in
cools the most critical components first
and then once it's heated Rises at the
top of the power supply so it's very
cool looking you know it's not nearly as
heavy as as the other fanless power
supply that I had a look at which is
kind of kind of refreshing in some ways
because it means that your system
doesn't already weigh as much as a like
wheelbarrow full of bricks before you
even start putting other components in
it so there's the full specs there I
think we already showed this on the side
and you can see even at the bottom of
the unit there are a few ventilation
holes so these are likely strategically
placed so they can get a little bit of
airflow to some critical component that
needs to get a little bit of cooling
done so let's have a look at the modular
cables that are included the 400 watt
supply all right so inside here we will
find one modular 2 2 for up to a 4 + 4
pin power connector so that's either a 4
pin or an 8 pin depending on what your
motherboard requires then we have a PCI
Express 6 + 2 pin as well as a 24-pin
power for your motherboard in the next
bag
and again the cable holding bag we have
okay we've also got a power cord for the
back of the unit and then here you will
find
Ceyda and molex cables okay clearly see
what I'm doing all right what do we have
so this one has to set up this one has
this is a molex to too floppy adapter so
you can use that if you still require
one of those connectors we have a triple
theta connector and then we have three
molex and a to molex so that's all the
modular cables now I'm just gonna check
really quickly if you can actually plug
in all modular cables at the same time
and it looks like you cannot so you're
gonna have to decide which which three
of these four connectors you are going
to want to plug in so you can either
have five SATA and three molex or five
ml x + 3 theta so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the C tonic X series
400 watt 80 plus gold power supply and I
love those gold heat sinks in there just
a nice little accent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
