gets featured on the when show bill
blogs the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it welcome to my unboxing and overview
of the latest and greatest from Ben Q
this is the twenty four twenty te whose
main advantages over the previous
flagship twenty four twenty t slash
twenty four twenty TX for the one with
the built in transmitter is the fact
that it's capable of a 144 Hertz refresh
rate versus 120 Hertz so while the 144
Hertz refresh rate isn't necessarily
needed for something like 3d vision if
you just want as many frames displayed
on the screen per second as freaking
possible then you'll want that it also
has what they're calling their zero
flicker technology which means that at
any backlight setting you're not going
to have annoying flickering which can be
fatiguing on the eyes particularly
during long gaming sessions and those
are kind of the key differences here but
we'll walk through the rest of it as we
keep going here so it's LED backlit it's
Windows 8 compatible I should sure as
bloody heck hope so I had some video 3d
vision ready including light boost
technology which dramatically improves
the 3d vision experience making it much
brighter and less blurry and sort of
gross in general they're the official
tournament monitor of Intel Extreme
Masters and I believe this is also an
MLG endorsed model as well so it has
some gaming sort of optimized features
including the ability to set different
profiles for particular games in fact it
comes pre-loaded with a couple of
different FPS modes optimized for CS 1.6
and CS source of all things there are
other FPS that people play these days
but whatever and then you can also
download profiles from your favorite
gamers which is kind of neat it comes
with a little controller here so you can
either use the redesigned on-screen
display or and with the buttons on the
side of the monitor control it or you
can actually thumb through things with
the wheel here select things go back and
press different profiles and change
things on the fly with the controller to
actually kind of
good implementation we've used it before
on the 24 22 comes with a disk so you
know what to do with that a dual link
DVI cable because this runs at 1920 by
1080 with a high refresh rate it does
need a dual link DVI cable for optimal
performance it comes with a built-in USB
hub so there's a USB to USB B cable as
well as a power cable VGA cable you can
throw that away with the disc as well
and then we've also got the height
adjustable stand and a dust cover which
they include with many of their premium
grade gaming monitors these days they're
using a hard foam however it is
extremely well packed an extremely thick
hard foam with lots of cushioning around
the corners so you can see right there
that they've got about a good inch and a
half of corner protection which is
extremely important because that is
where things like this tend to get
broken so we'll walk you through the
assembly process here really quickly
line the three holes with the notches
here there's a little arrow that
indicates where you want it to end up
facing front so we'll go ahead and put
that in there meaning when you need to
and then turn it until it locks and once
it's locked you can go ahead and rotate
it freely just like that to lock it in
place you can either use your hands or a
flathead screwdriver to go ahead and
tighten that next up we peel all the
plastic off of it I really wish they'd
just stop putting glossy surfaces on
these things entirely because it's more
work to protect them with plastic more
work to take the plastic off when I'm
putting it together and then more work
to keep it clean later on after the fact
and it just doesn't look any better but
whatever okay so let's go ahead and show
you the final assembly step which is to
go ahead and click it into place like
that and you might have gone Linus how
are you going to show me all the
interfaces on the bottom if you've gone
and assembled it first it's going to be
more difficult no no don't worry I'm
getting to that so it has height adjust
so actually a fairly wide range of
height adjust quite nice indeed
you've got your tilt okay you got your
swivel okay which I showed you before
already and finally ah
there we go pivot love to see pivot is
something I actually only really used to
access the ports because I'm not a
photographer and if I wasn't
photographer I wouldn't be using this
monitor because as far as color accuracy
goes and color depth this is not going
to compare very favorably to an IPS VA
or pls panel it's mostly optimized for
speed which is great for gaming but not
a professional sort of video or photo
work here's the built-in hub so there's
the input for that as well as a single
output and then the other two are
actually sorry I'm going to go ahead and
do this too you are on the side of the
monitor right here as well as a
headphone pass-through if you're using
HDMI in it's kind of nice to have you've
also got two HDMI in so that's another
thing that makes this kind of gaming
optimized is that you can have your ps3
and your Xbox and your PC all kind of
hooked up to at the same time switch
between them pretty easily you've got
that useless VGA port please please for
the love of whatever you believe and
don't plug anything into that and
finally you've got DisplayPort which is
not dumb and then last but not least
you've got the little control pod thing
that actually docks with magnetically to
the side of the monitor which also has
plastic on it there you go so it sits
there held in by like a little magnet
thing and you go ahead and plug that in
if you do decide to use it but you don't
have to it's completely removable should
you prefer that approach last but not
least you've got a Kensington lock which
I think is more for like tournament
people than actual like regular people
who don't usually lock down their
monitors but if you have a little bunch
of these set up at a tournament that's
not necessarily a bad idea to have
implemented and then check this out
another gamer optimized feature is the
headphone hook on the back of the
monitor so I'm going to run and grab a
pair of headphones so I can show you how
that might work in a real world scenario
boom so that way you can have your
headphones hanging behind your monitor
instead of on the front of your desk
wanted them oh yeah it also has a
carrying handle so the carrying handle
is kind of sturdy but will not kind of
sturdy it's very sturdy but the thing I
don't like about it is it's not very
well balanced so you can see when I hold
it like this it kind of hangs like that
but I don't really know what else they'd
be able to do about that other than
repositioning it to the top of the panel
for example which might cause it to lose
some of its strength so I think that
pretty much wraps it up for the actual
unboxing portion so stay tuned guys
we'll be right back whoo
l√©a crap it's the first 120 Hertz
monitor that doesn't have color depth
then color accuracy that looks
completely balls unbelievable I actually
love the 2420 te I'm extremely impressed
by this monitor normally the compromises
that get made when you amp up the
refresh rate is generally with respect
to image quality particularly in terms
of color depth now color depth refers to
that banding that exists when you have
similar colors that aren't quite the
same and the monitor just isn't capable
of reproducing enough in between so you
end up with like these chunks of colors
you'll see this a lot of the time with
movies and things like dark scenes
you'll see like big blocks of like
slightly lighter brown and big blocks of
slightly darker brown because either the
bitrate of the file is very low or the
display you're watching on isn't very
good
so that is not a problem on this monitor
which I'm extremely impressed by not
only that but this is more than a 120
Hertz display this is a 144 Hertz
display and it's really the first one
that I can recommend without an
asterisks because before I'd say yeah I
recommend 120 Hertz monitors if the
refresh rate is really important to you
if it's really important and then what I
would always say is I personally prefer
higher resolution and better color
accuracy for a more immersive gaming
experience
now I'm only actually left with one of
those points are you going to be doing
any professional you know Photoshop work
by the we have the star citizen hangar
module running on here are you going to
be able to do any professional photoshop
or like color correction work on here
the answer is no it's not that good but
it's so much better than the typical TN
gaming monitor that I'm going to take
that caveat away from my recommendation
so the only thing that's really left is
you still can't get high resolution
monitors that are also high refresh rate
and this is due to a limitation in the
bandwidth that can be delivered by most
of the display interfaces we have today
so something like HDMI 2.0 or better
DisplayPort 1.2 implementations could
address this in the future but for now
this is what we've got and as far as the
24 20 te goes
I am extremely impressed guys I
wholeheartedly recommend this monitor
it's expensive but it is so much better
than the last generation T and T X just
due to the fact that the color
reproduction is dramatically improved
that I mean I just kind of gushing about
it for another three minutes I don't
know what else to say Ben Q's got a
winner on their hands here and compared
to other 3d monitors that I've seen this
is hands-down the one to get don't
forget to subscribe - tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment if you're as freaking surprised
as me that this thing doesn't look bad
okay I mean no offense to you know
everyone else who tried to build a 3d
monitor that was high refresh rate but
what can I say and I think that's pretty
much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
