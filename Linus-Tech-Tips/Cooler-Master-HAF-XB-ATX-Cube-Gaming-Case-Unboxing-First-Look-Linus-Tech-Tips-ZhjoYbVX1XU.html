what should be fairly evident based on
the outside of the box this is the hath
XP from coolermaster which is a
continuation of the ever popular half
series so it started with a half 932
which was an ATX mid tower that offered
extreme airflow for the price and for
the form factors I mean the whole thing
was basically like mesh and fans and
making sure that all your system
components stayed cool then we saw the
lower cost half 922 then I believe we
saw the half X and then the half nine
one two now we have a half a cube case
now cute cases are more common with some
of these sort of boutique e case guys
like we've seen a cube from Lee and Lee
we've seen cubes for mountain mods and
pace labs over the years but most of the
mainstream guys don't really do cubes so
I'm really excited to see what sort of a
a more experienced case maker like
coolermaster can do with this form
factor the cube form factor is sort of
unique because what it does do is it
gives a lot of room but you normally
don't find in an enclosure above and
potentially below the motherboard
because the motherboard usually takes up
a lot of space inside the case not
because it is actually physically large
I mean a motherboard is thin but it
takes up a lot of space inside the
chassis because you can't really put
anything over top of it it's it's just
sort of it's sort of full so what you
can do by lying the motherboard down
flat is you can get access to sort of
unique ways to use the space so first
where you see the packing material so
you got a little about an inch and then
a little more than an inch on the sides
and I mean honestly for our pretty this
is a pretty light case considering its
size and the steel construction it feels
very very sturdy like you could probably
yeah just put all your weight on this
thing I mean like I said an experienced
case maker like Coolermaster
don't expect them to make any new
bearers like it being kind of flimsy
like you see with mountain mods and
closures although those are all aluminum
which is harder to make more rugged and
more strong so the first thing we're
going to do is I get all these panels on
screwed actually not quite all in
because I want to show you the outside
first so on the side you find
ventilation you expect that from a half
series enclosure you also find handy
dandy handles that can be used for
carrying the case around and you can use
to maneuver it quite easily these are
not levers so you don't pull up on these
to open up the side panel the side panel
is removed by removing the screws and
then sliding it back so those are just
for airflow and for handling the case
the other side is identical same thing
you got handles you got airflow holes so
nothing that you haven't seen before
like ten seconds ago all right on the
back we've got a 120mm fan more
ventilation again as we've come to
expect 280 mill fans standard seven PCI
slots as well as it appears to be a
cable tie and a protruded power supply
mounting cage so what that does is that
gives us more room inside the case for
things like cable management because
remember your power supply is going to
be like this long and then you're going
to have a bunch of more space on the end
for where the cables need to come out so
by doing this case manufacturers instead
of making their entire chassis another
inch deeper can just protrude the power
supply a little bit and I guess sort of
sort of cheap give you a smaller
enclosure that way with just a little
bit of a bump up the back in the top you
see what appears to be a 200 millimeter
fan mounting fan mounting spacing with
rubber grommets and what is a very
see-through mesh so while I like to see
windows to see into my chassis and see
what you know the cool leet stuff that I
put in there I don't mind a thin mesh
like this because you can as you can
hear as you can see you can see through
it quite clearly so you'll get a very
good aesthetic even though it's not
using a window on the front of the case
we've got two 120 millimeter fans with
more mesh to five and a quarter inch
base to hot-swap three and a half inch
drive sleds which are really cool
because here
so they're compatible with three and a
half inch or two and a half inch so this
is that standard rubberized grommet
mount thing that we've seen with
Coolermaster in the past you can put a
two and a half inch drive in using these
holes more ventilation on the drive cage
itself and instead of bending it like we
used to
you actually just slide it open and then
clip it into place just like that with a
drive on it this allows it to be a lot
more sturdy
whereas on those other ones like I don't
have commented on this a lot in the past
where I say yeah it looks really flimsy
once you put a drive in it it's okay now
I no longer have to say that it just
doesn't look flimsy and once you put a
drive in it should be that much that
much more okay so those lock into place
quite nicely you've also got your front
power reset endicott excuse me power led
you've got hold on nope power led is the
illuminated button here that's your hard
drive activity LED microphone headphone
and 2 USB 3 ports USB 3 is finally
standard on pretty much every single new
case which is great I remember it was so
frustrating for so long you know half
the chassis didn't have USB 3 the other
half of them had it but with a
pass-through that plugged into the back
of your motherboard so in order to put
together your half XP you're going to
want it
look at that Wow considering the price
of this case that is a very very solid
side panel I mean that's the big again
guys like color master they do not screw
around when it comes to the overall
build quality of the case so even though
it's pretty light it's not like they're
using lightweight material mean look at
this they've punched out most of this
panel but it still has only this much
flex to it and I'm putting a lot of
force on it you can see from oh yeah no
still good yeah you can see how much
force I'm putting on it it does not bend
at all extremely rigid love to see that
because it just means that there's going
to be less strain on the components if
anything does happen if you're shipping
the system which is a concern if you're
a system builder like NCIX you know you
look at you go oh well you know huh
that's going to put a lot of strain on
the motherboard when that when that gaze
flexes like that not gonna have that
happen with a well-built chassis so in
terms of
included accessories you've got tons and
cable management ties this is way more
than I'm used to seeing with a case you
have a whole whack load of two and a
half inch drive sleds and I'll show you
where these go in a minute included
speaker as well as all the screws you'll
need to assemble your system so once we
get inside let's start on this side
check this out dedicated two and a half
inch drive mounting so with those two
front hot swaps you can mount up to six
SSDs in this case completely natively
all you do is throw your SSDs in the
little rails slide them in and it's
pretty much what you're used to seeing
in terms of hard drive mounting except
it's an entire dedicated two and a half
inch cage and again extremely well-built
at the back of the case remember those
two 80ml fans those are going to be
directly cooling your your SSDs here and
honestly I probably wouldn't install
anything here I'd just use them as
passive airflow the five and a quarter
inch base are completely tooless so you
open them up lock them just like that
and you can remove them very easily and
this is a design we've seen on the half
series before just by folding back these
little tabs which don't even look like a
tab they're very well integrated into
the aesthetic design of the case which
is very industrial and then you use the
tool list mounting in order to throw
your five and a quarter inch drive in
there lots of space at the back for
longer optical drives and cable
management speaking of cable management
there are tons of cable management
options in this case check this out
cable management loops here I love these
things they're awesome they help you
keep things tidy look at all the cable
management loops that they've popped
into the bottom here so you can see
those here all the cables that need to
write even like they've even put in
dedicated cable management loops for
these fans at the back so you can go
cable here tie it down here tie it down
there and get everything over to the
power supply area where you can see more
cable management loops more cable
management loops the interface for the
hot-swap 3 and of 3 and a half inch
drive bays in the front so single molex
power then you run two SATA data cables
in order to activate those you've got
noise dampening foam so this is under
the power supply as well as a removable
filter that goes under the power supply
itself
they've also lifted the power supply up
a little bit and I'm glad to see that
because I recently had
power supply died in in an older define
r2 case from fractal this was totally my
bad but what I did is I put a 120
millimeter fan power supply in it fan
down and I put the case onto a carpeted
area yeah that thing died
it totally starved from air Floyd didn't
even think about it as I was kind of
throwing it under a desk and not
thinking I was using it as a file server
so this would have saved my power supply
right here because even though it
wouldn't have been optimal it would have
been able to grab some air from the
inside of the case by bringing it up
through these gaps so it wouldn't have
completely suffocated so that ya would
have saved my bacon let's move up into
the top of the chassis where we find a
couple cool things so number one is the
removable motherboard tray which you can
take off just by removing four screws
here and lifting the whole motherboard
tray out that'll make it easier to cable
manage the bottom of the case as well as
you know install all your components
outside of the case and then put them in
personally and I'd probably try and do
it without it because yeah my hands are
pretty small but I can handle it if you
have larger hands though that could be a
boon for you
huge CPU cutout so you'll have no
problems installing the back plates of
larger CPU coolers yeah even when the
even when everything is still in the
chassis even when the motherboard is
already installed on the motherboard
tray you can see also that those front
120 millimeter fans also have 140
millimeter fan mounts and the spacing
looks right for a radiator which is
outstanding because you could put a dual
120 millimeter radiator here looks like
you could pretty easily fit ah yes you
could easily fit another 120 millimeter
radiator here that looks like enough
spacing so you could have at least a
triple triple radiator water cooling
setup in here with no problems at all
aesthetics are awesome I mean if you're
going to have that nice loose mesh on
the top so you can see everything inside
the case then you better make sure
you're including things with black
cables so black cabled fans that are
either either three pin or molex another
black cabled vent and all black cables
for the front panel connectors including
the audio the power the and the LEDs the
USB 3 as well
as yeah that's pretty much it hold on a
sec guys here's something cool guys
check this out with a little bit of
modding you could install a seven a
seven PCI slot motherboard but you could
install a dual slot card in the very
bottom this is a big deal if you want to
do sort of massive sli configurations as
some boards don't have the correct
spacing to put your last dual slot card
here because it just doesn't really work
that way so check this out you can put
it here and then all you'd have to do
very high panel on you can see the cards
going to get lots of ventilation through
these holes right over here so no
problems there so all you'd have to do
is in order to use the rear exhaust on
your card potentially if you have a rear
exhaust card is I'd probably you know
Dremel some holes kind of here so that
you can you can get access to that
airflow so very cool stuff the crazy
Russian spotted that he's guest helping
me film today so kudos to him for for
noticing that that's awesome and I think
that actually pretty much covers it I
just want to show you guys yet more
cable management loops right here in
here above the five and a quarter inch
and the three and a half inch cages I
guess if I had one thing to caution you
guys about before buying this case is
make sure that you have an external
storage solution because it only really
supports two three and a half inch
drives other than that this guy is
completely ready for SSD more than
anything else thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look at the half
XP from Coolermaster don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from Roma
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos here's something I didn't notice
until we were putting the case back
together but check this out so those
super sturdy plastic handles I showed
you on the outside are actually
reinforced by this piece of metal here
that's part of why they're so strong and
they're not going anywhere because
you're picking up the chassis by the
actual chassis not by a piece of plastic
that's attached to the side panel which
is attached to the chassis good stuff
again just great design choices overall
in this case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
