game at your house yes
do you like the gaming kind of unusual
places hell yeah okay whoa dude okay I
was kind of thinking like in a hotel or
coffee shop
anyway the point is if you are gaming on
the go you're gonna have to make some
kind of sacrifice be it performance
weight or battery life so today we're
gonna investigate which option makes the
most sense for mobile gaming but not
until after our sponsor synergy synergy
allows you to combine your desktop
computers laptops for that matter into
one cohesive system by allowing you to
share your mouse and keyboard between
multiple systems check it out at the
link below
now there are really three approaches
for gaming on the go huge honkin gaming
laptop thinner gaming laptop or thin
enlight notebook with an external GPU
and today's objective is to find out
which one is the best objectively the
best option so let's meet our contenders
coming in at a whopping ten point three
five pounds this laptop has been
described as a shot of adrenaline a big
heavy beast of a laptop and barely even
portable the Asus G 703 is possibly the
only mobile asterisk device on the
market that can actually take advantage
of Intel's Core I 989 50 K some people
have even gotten it to do five gigahertz
on all six of its processing cores
and when you combine that with a GTX
1080 32 gigs of ram and a raid zero nvme
storage array this laptops banks most
people's gaming desktops then over on
the other end of the spectrum weighing
in at a featherweight 2.9 pounds is the
razer stealth which is well for being
honest basically useless for serious
gaming that is until we hit it with a
gtx 1080 in an external enclosure via
Thunderbolt 3 now it's rocking a quad
core Core i7 16 gigs of ram nvme storage
and of course the GTX 1080 that we just
duct-taped to it helping it kick gaming
laptop stereotypes in the balls by
combining extreme portability with
extreme gaming performance also an
extremely useful sometimes touchscreen
finally the middle weight in our bout is
the Razer Blade 2018 at four point six
three pounds this laptop is on the
heftier end of what we might call total
but it does have the muscle to make up
for that junk in the trunk it's got a
six core i7 87 58 and a gtx 1070 max-q
which some might say is the perfect
compromise for gamers but then again
some people also love the Olive Garden
but like you go there and at first
you're like stoked about the unlimited
bread but then you get your pasta and
it's
well basically it's more bread so then
we have designed a few challenges for
these machines to compete in so without
further ado let's get ready to ride not
allowed to say that because I will get
in trouble now challenge number one our
three contestants arrived with their
laptops in their backpacks at some
destination let's say the gym huh just
kidding
these guys um then they need to game so
they got to get it out and ready as
quick as possible
Ready Set goldfish all right
so Colton Oh Colton's got the G 703 whoa
that's gonna be a bit of a challenge
here the Chimera
the Chimera has a whopping two power
chords for him to set up to power bricks
for him to figure out how to manage but
it does make up for some of that with
its massive IO where it blows pretty
much everything else out of the water
it's got Thunderbolt 3 it's got USB 3
it's got an SD card reader it's got an
actual Ethernet port James meanwhile is
already completely set up the blade
strikes kind of a middle ground so he's
got ample USB he's got it he's got no
touch screen unfortunately on this
machine I'll help you out with I'll help
you out with that there he's got
Thunderbolt 3 he's got mini DisplayPort
and HDMI along with Thunderbolt 3 so he
can do multiple displays out and Alex
are you set up now yep
Wow so coming in first is the thin
gaming laptop coming in second actually
is the ultra light with the external GPU
enclosure I mean you do give up some IO
though it's only got 2 USB ports plus
that Thunderbolt port and a headphone
jack so but then again if you're willing
to carry this around you do get
additional ports including Ethernet over
here and coming in dead last poor
Coleman are you even at the desktop yet
though no one can see what you're typing
it's pretty clear that the winner here
in terms of setup is our thinner gaming
laptop but now it's time for round two
the drag race of the computer world
Cinebench which hopefully colton will
figure out how to open at some point
look we had we had Riley
we had Riley cast for this spot and it
just like he was busy with teklynx
anyway on your marks get set bench it no
Colton wrong one fortunately you have a
super fast machine so we can just cancel
that run the CPU one you'll probably
still finish before them so you can
actually see here colton six core 12
thread processor has already overtaken
the blade Seldes quad-core 8 thread
processor has remember there's more to
it than just how many cores and how many
threads you have there's how high it'll
turbo and how long it'll stay there in
fact it's even closing in on the blade
although this one does look like it's
gonna come in slightly ahead with about
a thousand points finishing well second
in time but that's only because of
Colton with nearly 1200 points the
chimera is clearly the fastest machine
here when it comes to multi-threaded CPU
intensive processes and the blade
stealth does show some of its weakness
because there's only so much cooling and
therefore curbing up that you can do in
such a thin and light chassis there we
go about five hundred and thirty points
so when it comes to getting serious work
done on the road you're pretty much
stuck with something at least this class
with more serious work being most
suitable for obviously the most powerful
machine now it's time for the main event
gaming performance so let's get shadow
the Tomb Raider fired up here make sure
you guys are all on the high presets and
fight whoa did Colt and get the game
launched both well before everyone else
looks like that raid zero nvme is
working out for him over there
alright everyone set up and good to go
everyone's on high yeah everyone's on
directx12
go see who manages to load in first pull
pull out wide so we can see
Colton's out ahead with the loading
times followed by I mean this is
basically what we expected I can't act
too surprised right now now what's
interesting here is that even though our
chimera has the same GPU a desktop grade
GTX 1080
as our blade stealth does in its
external enclosure the frame rates that
it's seeing are significantly higher
because you're gonna be limited not just
by the PCI Express 4x interface /
Thunderbolt 3 here but also by the fact
that the data has to be sent back from
the core to the display over that same
link causing a little bit of
bottlenecking also this processor
doesn't turbo up to 5 gigahertz or
whatever so what that means in the real
world is that the blade which also has
the benefit of a nice fast 120 Hertz
display compared to our blade stealth
ends up with better real-world FPS at
the same resolution even though it has a
gtx 1070 max-q so that's like a neutered
1070 so no real surprises in shadow of
the Tomb Raider or in any of the other
games that we ran while we're at it
bigger is more batter when it comes to
gaming performance but with that said
our razor blade stealth and therefore
the Ultrabook category in general is not
down for the count yet because our final
category is portability as I alluded to
before the G 703 has terrible battery
life like you could put the largest
battery allowed in it and it would still
barely have juice for over an hour
as for the razor blade well it does a
bit better but even if you're just
watching YouTube videos or using Excel
you're still looking at around 4 hours
of battery life max not to mention that
both of those laptops are heavier than
I'd like to carry around with me all day
the stealth on the other hand is easy to
cart around and has a battery that lasts
over eight hours with light to moderate
use that is over double the blade and
almost eight times the G 703 and this is
where things kind of get a little bit
tricky so we set out to determine which
one was the best gaming laptop but you
could make a pretty strong argument for
the clear winner being having a gaming
desktop at home and a thin enlight for
when you're traveling with that said for
people that travel a lot or are on shift
work or our truckers or whatever else
the case may be
that might just not be an option so for
me personally a big part of me is
leaning towards the external GPU because
I hate carting around a gaming laptop a
lot and probably 80 to 90% of what I use
my notebook for is kind of writing
scripts on the go so that gives me the
flexibility to do what I need to do
during the day without running out of
battery but still be able to have the
full experience when I'm able to get to
a desk with that said it's just hard to
recommend to most people because first
you need a notebook with a Thunder pool
3 X 4 port then you need to buy an
expensive enclosure then you need to get
a GPU knowing that there isn't going to
be enough bandwidth over thunderbolt to
take full advantage of it meaning in the
end you have paid top dollar for a
middle-of-the-road gaming experience so
for the time being I'm gonna keep
rocking this but will have to let you
guys decide and let us know in the
