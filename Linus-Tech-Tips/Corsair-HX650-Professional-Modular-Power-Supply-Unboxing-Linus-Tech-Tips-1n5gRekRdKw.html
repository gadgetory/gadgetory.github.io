unboxing the corsair HX 650 watt
Professional Series power supply so
compared to their older HX 620 this is
actually the replacement unit so let's
start getting this thing open so besides
the extra 30 watts the other main
benefit of this over the 620 watt
version is actually that it comes with a
longer warranty
so the 620 had a five-year warranty and
this one comes with a seven-year
warranty Corsairs warranty services
excellent I've actually got a HX 620 of
my own although knock on wood I've never
actually had to RMA it anyway so inside
we're gonna find the user's manual right
on the top comes in a bunch of different
languages very very dry reading then
inside you will find a powered by
corsair sticker along with some black
zip ties for managing your cables you're
gonna find a power cord then just hold
on to things that would work a lot
better for black screws for mounting the
power supply in your case and then let's
have a look at the modular cable package
so it comes in a little corsair baggie
that's sealed by velcro so you can store
things in it and open it and close it as
you please so here we go modular cables
it uses the same connector as the old HX
620 so you got your little 5 pin there
so we've got one two three SATA cables
then we have two six plus two pin PCI
Express cables that are modular and then
we have oh wow another two six plus two
PCI Express that's a lot more than used
to come on the HX 620 and then we've
only got two molex connectors so that's
actually a good move I think on Corsairs
part the old one used to come with I
believe four and it's kind of necessary
these days so here you're gonna find
something quite quite strange indeed and
we will find the pre-attached cable so
you've got a 24 pin cable here so that's
your 20+4 pin it's actually detachable
if you need to attach to a 24 pin
motherboard or a 20 pin sorry and then
we have a 4 + 4
so that's an 8-pin EPS connector now
here I'm actually a little bit confused
here I have to confess as to what
exactly these cables are oh I see this
is brilliant so this is actually a Y
adapter cable so you plug in one six pin
here just like that and then it actually
splits out into two six plus two pin so
that gives you a total of four six plus
two pin or eight pin PCI Express
connectors that's pretty neat actually
and then you can plug in all of the
modular cables for SATA and molex that
are included by just plugging them all
in here it's a very clean little
interface let's have a look at the unit
itself so on the front of it here we've
got a little shiny you know this is made
by Corsair
don't pretend you made it if you're not
Corsair sticker then we have these
labeling on the side this is actually
quite a small unit compared to many of
the high end power supplies that I've
seen in the past so on the back there's
no 115 or 230 volt switch so that means
that it's got active power factor
correction then on the other side we see
another label so if you install I
noticed if you install this in the
Corsair obsidian case you can perfectly
see their label so you can tell it was
designed with that in mind on the top of
the unit we'll find the specs so you can
see we've got 52 amps on the 12 volt
rail that's gonna be one of your most
important specs so you can actually draw
624 watts of the 650 from the 12 volt
rail so it's terrific to see that on the
bottom we've got a 120mm fan cooling the
unit and if it's anything like course
there's other power supplies it'll be
extremely quiet so just as a quick size
comparison against just a typical cheapo
power supply you can see it's only a
little bit longer than your standard OEM
power supply just that's about as long
as a warranty void if removed sticker is
wide so thank you for checking out my
video blog on the corsair HX 650 watt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
