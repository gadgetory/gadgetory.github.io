asked me many times for gameplay videos
so I'd like to share my favorite game
with you I got to warn you though if I
lose sometimes I get a little bit angry
ah
I'm really sorry that you had to see
that I think that it's just the fact
that you know I I lose my cool when I'm
not using a proper mechanical keyboard
for gaming and these membrane key
switches just it didn't help so I don't
want you guys to have to experience
gaming on a membrane keyboard anymore I
am announcing a video contest I will be
giving away Wow good throw thank you
five Corsair Vengeance k9d LED backlit
mechanical gaming keyboards however
there are a few stipulations yes this is
another video response contest the rules
are here your video must be named it
must start with Linus nerd rage giveaway
then whatever you want to call it maybe
your user name for example it must be 30
seconds or less one video per person it
must be submitted as a video response to
this video or I will not see it
I'm not accept 31 seconds is fine but
I'm not accepting anything that does not
meet these criteria because I get so
many entries I can't go through the
exception ones do not email me your
video do not private message me your
video if it's not a video response I'm
not going to see it okay the deadline is
November 11th which is Remembrance Day
in Canada so yay
you know veterans they worked really
hard for us to enjoy what we do today
entries will be judged by Linus slick
and diesel the following criteria will
be used to judge creativity humor and
style so you can interpret that however
you want but basically if it doesn't
tickle mine slicks and Diesel's fancy
then you probably won't win and it's not
always about production values
necessarily make sure you make it fun
subtle Corsair brand inclusions are
encouraged for bonus points since core
there is helping us to run this whole
contest so you know hey if you give them
a shout-out as part of your actually we

care if you live in Timbuktu submit your
30 second video response and for the
love like everything please don't ask me

keyboard that we destroyed they're all
