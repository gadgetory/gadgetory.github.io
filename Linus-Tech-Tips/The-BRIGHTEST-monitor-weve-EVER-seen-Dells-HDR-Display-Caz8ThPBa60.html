next big thing in display technology for
what seems like forever now I mean he'll
our first video about it is from 2014
and it's hard to find a decent TV
without that feature these days and yet
HDR is still far from a mainstream
feature on PC monitors but are we on the
cusp of a revolution sitting unknowingly
at the bottom of a looming s-curve about
to be forcefully catapulted into a
utopian future of well if we were then
the Dell U P 27:18 Q would be that
future it's a 4k monitor with full HD R
10 support and 1000 nits peak brightness
let's see if it's time to start giving a
crap
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel bear the simple VPN app start
your 7-day free trial at the link in the
video description when it comes to looks
the ultra sharp 27 4k HDR from Dell land
in the Goldilocks zone of understated
sophistication not too flashy for an
office and not too dull for the $1,500
price tag it's got a space gray.we let's
say that it's got a grey plastic finish
one of the easiest to use on screen
displays in recent memory and a generous
amount of mobility the stand can tilt
swivel pivot and whatever that word for
adjusting the height is let's go with
elevate but also the opposite of that
there are two HDMI 2.0 a ports on the
back the a is for HD are both regular
and mini DisplayPort 1.4 Forte's also HD
already an audio line out and a pretty
sick integrated USB hub with six USB 3
ports two with fast charging and dual up
links that so the U P 27:18 Q can be
used as a KVM switch to quickly move
between tasks on two systems neat and
there's a bunch of impressive specs
inside the display too it's got a 4k 60
Hertz
IPS panel with true 10-bit color and an
incredible 384 local dimming zones that
is what allows it to produce super
bright points with dark areas right next
to them and those bright points can be
really bright up to a thousand nits
fun fact nits is another word for the
unit Candela which is equal to the light
output of one candle so this is
basically like the output of a thousand
candles in your face sort that's the
peak brightness typical brightness
sustained across the whole screen is 400
nits which is still brighter than most
displays so all this Kuhlman
then in a truly professional grade
monitor with high contrast ratios
accurate colors with Delta ease under -
and excellent coverage of even the most
demanding color gamut it even comes with
a nifty color calibration report in the
Box Pete okay then
so you're stoked as hell and you've got
the windows 10 creators update and
you're ready to bask in the glory of HD
are you hit the toggle button then hey
why does it look so drab isn't HDR
supposed to be uh what's the technical
term again the huh welcome to the HDR
rabbit-hole HDR is an awesome technology
but windows 10 implementation of HDR
really demonstrates just how unsettled
the dust is so the colors wet dull when
HDR was turned on for two reasons the
first has to do with color space most of
the content on your PC is likely to be
in the sRGB color space which has fewer
colors than rec 2020 the color space
used by the HDR 10 standard so when HDR
is on colors need to be remapped to rec
2020 and since srgb has fewer colors in
the gamut it's not all these ugly fit
the second reason that looks bunk has to
do with brightness with HDR on windows
is imposing a ceiling of a hundred nits
on the screens brightness the colors
don't actually change they still have
the same hue it's just that your eyes
perceive them as less rich or saturated
well okay but that's pretty crap Linus
why would windows turn the brightness
down because if it didn't you would get
blasted when the non HDR content is
remapped if the whitest whites were
allowed to be represented by a thousand
nits of brightness a blank white page
and say Microsoft Word would be blinding
plus all the other colors would look
super saturated and
long so you might think then that it
would be better if windows could leave
all the colors alone until it detects
HDR content that's being viewed and then
it could just adjust them on the fly but
that's just not how it works right now
okay so then the solution is to just
switch it on when you're watching HDR
content like stuff on Netflix or Amazon
Prime video or YouTube not so fast
those guys offer HDR content but due to
browser limitations it's actually only
available through the apps on your HD
already smart TV for now fine then - at
least there's gaming right ok this one
yes Mass Effect Andromeda looks sick in
HDR unfortunately if you also like to
play other games right now you're bound
to end up disappointed at the moment HDR
games are few and far between and many
of the titles you see advertised as HDR
only do so on the Xbox one S or the
PlayStation 4 or 4 Pro where that TV HDR
ecosystem is more mature HDR games are
coming though so in due time this
monitor will be great for gaming kind of
and it's a beautiful monitor but it's 4k
is capped at 60 Hertz and it's response
times at about 6 milliseconds are not
that competitive with the top gaming
displays so then if you're a gamer who
needs a monitor today your money may be
better spent elsewhere and if it's HDR
you're after then hooking up your PC to
a giant 4k HDR TV for the same price
that might make a fair bit of sense so
then is the yupi 27:18 cue a solution
looking for a problem no actually not at
all unlike Dells own 8k monitor this one
has some very real applications today if
you're a content creator you might want
to consider the investment wide coverage
of multiple gamuts you
you the flexibility to produce in
whatever standard your project demands
the KVM switch is super elegant not to
mention very convenient and compared to
the pricing of professional-grade
calibrated displays honestly you're not
really paying that more for HDR and
Dells solid reputation for monitor build
quality and support if you're a Content
consumer on the other hand well it's
back to the s-curve we go right now I'd
say we're about yeah and I'm going to
say maybe wait for about yeah okay
