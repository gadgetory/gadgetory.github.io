2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair alright guys I'm here at
distance which is the spiritual
successor to Nitronic rush
I've actually been following this game
for a long time ever since he was a
school project back at PAX Prime so what
can you tell me what is your game become
over that time so nitronic we released
actually in back in 2011 it's actually
released on 11/11/11 which was the same
day as Skyrim ironically and but yeah
and since then we've actually graduated
from DigiPen and we've we formed a
company called refract studios and since
then we've actually been working on
distance and you know we actually did a
Kickstarter for it
last last year in October two years ago
in October and that went over really
well and ever since we've been plugging
away and then primarily it basically has
a game it's a just what we're calling
survival racing game and you actually
have a bunch of abilities as a car like
boost jump and fly and you're trying to
navigate like treacherous obstacles
around the tracks and yeah so today's
actually or this practice is our first
time we're ever really showing it
publicly and it's gone over really well
so we're really happy with it we're
gonna be releasing the beta hopefully
pretty soon and then yeah and we'll keep
it going from there I'm actually really
excited because that's some of you guys
know I used to be a huge fan of the
really old Need for Speed game so I
needs to love them but I've never really
been into that many racers in general
and ever since theme for Speed has gone
completely in the trash in my opinion
sorry if you like it but in my opinion
I've been looking for another racer and
I've been really excited for this one
because I have played it a few times now
what can you tell me about the adventure
mode which is a fairly new mode that you
guys have introduced yeah so we're
actually showing a venture mode for the
first time here at PAX and basically
what it is is kind of like a short story
mode where you're like going through and
you're learning how the car works you're
learning the abilities you're kind of
discovering the world and hopefully
you'll see kind of a short story unfold
as you're doing that
I'm sure that can help because this
isn't necessarily a traditional racer
you can like go parkour and get chopped
in half but still be racing and flying
and all that kind of stuff so I'm sure
something that could help a new person
into the game how can someone get this
game or get into the beta so right now
you can actually pre-order the beta
survive the distance calm
we're gonna be on steam so we're
releasing on Windows Mac and Linux and
you know once the beta comes out then
we'll see we're looking into options of
potentially doing like an early access
you know or or just waiting until the
final games done so yeah
awesome thanks a lot if you want to see
all the rest of our PAX East content be
sure to subscribe the line effectives
and as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
