about you but I'm having basically kind
of the roughest week ever we killed the
dual socket board Anthony yeah you
killed the dual socket board that's Alex
Alex killed the dual socket board
Anthony got pulled out of the office on
a particularly busy week for an event
that ended up being a complete and utter
waste of time thank you Intel i I just
you know it's funny did the average
viewer out there there seems to be this
perception but when a company like
invites you to a product event that it's
like free travel you just got free
travel in hotel you guys are so you guys
sold out so hard like there's this
perception but what they don't seem to
realize is that it costs me money to
have myself or someone else out of the
office not just money but time time that
I might have spent with my family spent
clipping one of my toenails that's a
little long right now and is kind of
catching on the inside of my sock and
there's a little uncomfortable you know
the things that things that we might
have wanted to that I might have wanted
to do and in this case like I would I
would actually prefer not just in this
case but in most cases I would strongly
prefer having a company get on the phone
with me so I don't have to sit in an
airport for three hours sit on a plane
for anywhere from you know two to five
hours sit in an airport for another half
an hour waiting for my baggage and then
do the whole thing all over again
I would strongly prefer if they just got
on a phone gave me a PowerPoint
presentation where I can understand the
product and just sent one over so we can
test it in the comfort of our lab with
all of our equipment and all of our
staff that we can mount ideas off of all
of that good stuff and you haven't even
mentioned the opportunity cost of
Anthony not being here Anthony being in
an airport instead of being at his desk
being productive exactly so
audio issues persist is that where
you're laughing / dying
if you think the audios bad read my lips
apparently it's very quiet that's all
you're getting but we are weirdly we are
getting all the way into the yellow
territory so I don't know what to tell
you I can't turn it out because it's
gonna clip I can't do anything we're
just gonna have to live with it this is
your problem man turn it up when the ad
comes on and blasts you and you get a
noise complaint and a strata bill slash
condo fee bill alright so anyway it has
just been a rough week having people out
ivenn sick this week alex is gonna be
out next week so one of the videos that
he was supposed to get done this week
but he was busy breaking a motherboard
didn't get done this week so it means we
have to do more next week next week I'm
gonna be out of the office two days
actually we've got some really cool
videos that we're gonna be shooting next
week I love it when you're the office
don't okay well on one of the days I am
actually gonna be in the building I'm
just gonna be really busy so I don't
know if you guys remember the murder box
yeah it was sort of an unfortunately
named like boutique system integrator
that existed around eight nine years ago
anyway Charles the guy who was running
it eventually decided to do just a case
the MDP C X no X forma okay whatever I
can't remember it's called it's freaking
awesome though it looks incredible so
he's got a full system built up in it
including metal hard line tubing metal
hard line tubing with like these
gorgeous bends and stuff and what we're
gonna be doing is we're gonna have him
come into the studio and do like a
teardown of it so it's gonna be kind of
like like disassembling a supercar on
camera it's gonna be badass like a
supercomputer but not a supercomputer
because that's the specific thing and it
isn't that when I first saw that system
I was like I didn't even know such
things were possible like in Gladiator
when they see it when he sees the
Colosseum I didn't know men could build
such things
they weren't pc and gladiator times
okay
so let's jump into our first topic of
the day this one is we talked about it a
fair bit last week apparently my
explanation of it was very confusing
because a lot of the comments on the
windshield last week were just saying
that people were having a really hard
time understanding what the crap it was
that I was talking about exactly but the
GeForce Partner Program Nvidia is
claiming that this is all about reducing
confusion for the consumer but according
to an article written by yeah I know
according to an article written by hard
OCP it appears to be a means for Nvidia
using its stranglehold over the supply
of the GPU chips that its partners need
to survive using that to basically force
them to favor Nvidia products over AMD
products in their marketing specifically
in their marketing that talks directly
about gaming so our source here is this
was originally posted by clads in on the
forum and the original article is from
reddit seems to suggest although this is
of course in our slash AMD so take it
for what it is but seems to suggest that
the first victim of the GeForce partner
program may have already been unveiled
so gigabyte just introduced a new AMD
orden oriented external GPU box and the
branding is different from their other
external GPU box so we've actually got
one of the GT X 1080 based ones and it
uses the ARS branding while these new
AMD based ones wow this is like a how
deep do I have to go in these links to
find the actual where is the there you
go if the branding isn't just different
it's just way way way more basic yeah so
so worse and just rx 580
with that said it does have gaming in
the title which hopefully is an
indication that contrary to the rumor
partners will at least be able to use
like game or gaming in the branding for
their AMD products that's a descriptive
word isn't it MSI that the gaming is
actually their line of gaming they won't
be able to do that
well the or they'll have to take a
little TM off the top of it yeah so the
rumor was though that Nvidia would be
forcing their partners to actually
rename product lines that had gaming in
them for products that were not geforce
so it's still a work in progress though
because if you look at some of the
Amazon links to these these products
that have been otherwise D branded in
physical form the Amazon titles still
have those monikers in there like I'm
assuming they're gonna be taken away
eventually so maybe it's still like a
role out here that we're witnessing yeah
so it looks like there's some things
that still haven't been updated so some
Amazon product names apparently have
been updated now not for insignias like
ROG Strix and MSI gaming but for the
actual product names themselves some
have been updated and some of them
haven't do you have any examples of that
if you go to the forum thread there's a
bunch of examples now not just the Auris
one all right let's go ahead and pull
that up here so update number two yes
MSI seems to have removed all their
gaming from AMD graphics cards only
Nvidia ones have the gaming branding on
them now let's see if we can find yeah
this wow this thread is like really
going here we go
check this out no so this is an example
of one that has not been changed yet so
asus rog Strix radeon RX 560 now with
that said one of the things that I would
have to wonder is that given the the
complicated nature of updating the name
of a product that's out there in the
wild already is it possible we're not
seeing the full effect yet is it
possible that in video would be waiting
for like the next rollout of products
like like a 600 series graphics cards
you possibly retro actively like hey
best buy hey Walmart update your product
names on your websites I mean you could
ask for it but I mean what there's so
many channels yeah there's I mean
there's the websites there's the little
like tag on the actual shelf there's
flyers that they would be working out on
there's all kinds of promotional
materials that would be very difficult
to change and there's multiple
marketplaces like Amazon isn't even in
Australia presumably Australia has some
other you tailor that's big
they'd have to yeah I mean gay with is
PC PC case geared the Amazon PC online
I'm trying to remember who the big ones
are down there wait why did I search for
Amazon Australia it's just best really
is on such a weak man like such a weak
scorp tech is one of them that's one of
our mods on the forum used to work at
scorp tech but doesn't anymore so that's
that's really all I know about them did
you used to be Australian isn't anymore
no no still Australian no still super
Ostrom that can happen alright this was
originally posted on the for me I have
one question yes
there I saw some fear you talked about
the the supply that NVIDIA has on the
market being a bit of a stranglehold do
you think that applies to people like us
influencers and media who don't want to
speak out or disparage this move by
Nvidia because they're afraid that
they're not going to be sourced the GPUs
that they rely on to make reviews an
editorial content okay so that is a good
question here's the thing NVIDIA has to
if they're trying to create a
competitive advantage for themselves
they have to do so without creating a
bunch of negative sentiment amongst the
consumer base sort of I'm not actually
convinced like NVIDIA I I would describe
as sort of not the individuals that I
know they're everyone that I know that
works in Nvidia I really like on a
personal level but to describe them
corporately I would say they are a
little bit
Riggins but I'm not necessarily saying
that they haven't that they haven't
earned it in a sense like comes with a
market share yeah it comes with having
what I think it's like 75 percent market
share or something like that and
discrete graphics and that's in terms of
unit sales not in terms of dollars which
given that they have much higher end
products than AMD has it this time are
pretty significantly different so I'm
not saying that they haven't kind of
kind of earned it but we are the
stewards of that right a minute right so
here's the thing
Nvidia doesn't really have to care about
the sentiment now because at the end of
the day what else are you gonna buy you
know you can't find stock of anything so
people are basically buying whatever
they can get for one thing and for two
and videos in a position where in
certain segments they really are the
only product that makes any sense
especially at the high end so but but
but with that said Nvidia still seems to
somewhat care about their public image
because you never know when an AMD might
turn around and release something that
turns the market on its head and if
people had like this pent up negative
sentiment towards Nvidia it could it
could backfire on them then when you say
at the high end what are you talking
about are you talking about h EDT yeah
yeah I'm talking about well that's if
you're talking about likely Intel uses
that terminology yeah if you're talking
about server stuff then I don't does
this really apply because this is isn't
this about consumer grade yeah I'm
talking about high-end consumer I mean
AMD doesn't have anything competitive
with the 1080 TI
yeah all right and I mean as as for Vega
Vega 56 and Vega 64 I mean even before
the mining craze they they weren't they
weren't that competitive like they were
okay Vega 64 wasn't mega 56 was but you
haven't been able to buy a Vega 56 like
what where where are you supposed to get
a Vega 56 and you really think that when
they were deciding whether or not to
to make this move and how to spin it and
whether or not it would give them bad
press they thought you know what right
now nobody can buy anything cause a
crypto they really considered the crypto
mania and the availability of GPUs and
they're like ah we can probably get away
with this
I think so so so I think that the timing
is a big part of it and then I think the
other thing is like why not try to get
the press to buckle well it's because
they have far less of an impact on our
livelihood than they do on their
partners who rely on them for chips like
if so we I would be more worried about
YouTube than I would about Nvidia if
YouTube were the kind of company where I
didn't feel like you know they could
accept criticism as it is you know I can
I can I can tell our YouTube rep stuff
that I hate about the platform to his
face and his job anyway is to take that
feedback and actually try and make it
actionable and try and try and improve
things believe it or not YouTube does
actually care where his client yeah it's
it's where his client but he's also our
you know that's that's actually an
interesting way of looking at it so
we're his client but were his client in
a way we're in videos clients are not as
much because Nvidia could just find
someone else whereas once you reach a
certain point as a creator in much the
same way that YouTube doesn't really
focus much attention on the small
creators that that are replaceable they
do focus attention on the big ones that
are difficult to replace well I think
from invidious perspective
pretty much everyone can be replaced at
this point like they've literally done
it XFX
used to be a major nvidia partner
especially in north america back in the
day it was like 1 2 EVGA XFX
now ever since XFX
defected to AMD back in i think it was
the 4000 serious days don't put me on
that might've been 3000 series anyway
back then ever since then and video
basically went well ok you know where if
you're gonna defect if you're gonna go
from being exclusive Nvidia remember
this was at a time when in video was in
pretty rough shape with some hot running
cards it didn't perform that well if you
they're gonna turn tail and run into the
arms of AMD good luck with that we'll
just find someone else to replace you
and they did when BFG disappeared so BFG
was another sort of talked to your
partner for Nvidia in North America one
of their big things was that they
offered a lifetime warranty when Nvidia
discs are one BFG disappeared
Nvidia didn't you know they didn't run
out and try and find you know try and
like quietly fund through you know
venture capital someone to take over the
brand and continue it they just kind of
went yeah them's the breaks and if you
think about it that has been the
strategy with board partners since the
dawn of time like I could probably name
half a dozen board partners off the top
of my head who existed at one point at
least in North America and don't anymore
let's try well there's a PFT so I
already got that one there is chain tech
there's another one there is let me
think
gain word there's another one gain word
used to be like kind of like halo halo
tear products a bit
I think dabbled in GPUs at one point
they're gone entirely now from the
motherboard business - dang is that all
I got that's pretty good shoot I think
that's all I've got I mean and then
there's like there's like the really old
stuff like like back when like 3d labs I
think used to do graphics cards but I
don't think they ever did in video ones
for ati firegl diamond oh yeah diamond
multimedia sorry that's the one that I
was thinking not 3d labs diamonds okay
whatever that's fine that's fine then I
did have to Google one of them so it's
kind of cheating but that's not really
the point the point is I think Nvidia is
in a position where they feel like they
need their partners a lot less than
someone like YouTube apparently does
with us so let's see how this continues
to play out so they still have that
power and they don't really care it
doesn't matter this the sentiment is a
drop in the bucket compared to the power
of their market position so yeah but I
think that they are I think that they
wouldn't also risk going to press
directly with some
with some kind of an agreement that you
can only mention gaming with Nvidia
products and then a gag order if you
talk about it because if they ever
showed something like that to anyone in
the press it would be out there yeah
let's remember that it was AMD who
originally kind of leaked this or let it
be known because the press has so much
less to lose within video like worst
case scenario I've got to buy a half a
dozen graphics cards a year I mean at
the rate that we're going lately with
them releasing like two three graphics
cards every year bleh it's not even that
bad so yeah sure whatever go buy a video
yeah but I used to buy video cards but
the price of those video cards okay
that's true - Media Group's bankrupt had
to buy three graphics cards : really
Colton's got fired he's laid off alright
why don't we why don't we jump into one
of our one of our quick ones let me talk
with this one you want to talk about the
first put oh I've been following this
since it broke alright hold on we'll
talk about that in a minute first we got
to talk about our sponsors for the day
they might be behind us you're
vegetarian right yeah so I'm the only
one eating savage turkey today yeah
that's a real shame cuz it's pretty
delicious yeah so I'm gonna I'm gonna
jump right into the savage turkey spot
just because that's the that's like I'm
I'm actually not as hungry as I normally
am on the land show because I was
because you spent half of the wine show
eating in people's ears in 7.1 oh they
sent so many packs of maple buffalo
bacon this is like the highlight of my
week oh yeah they have other flavors as
well including some super spicy ones and
that's good let's get let's get through
the talking point so I get like I'm
drooling salivating savage turkeys jerky
is made with high quality ingredients
without nitrates or preservatives the
goal was to create a snack that's full
of flavor and not bad for you we've got
13 different flavors of jerky including
maple buffalo bacon the Moho is really
good the traditional is really good the
good 100 cracked pepper and sea salt is
really good and then they've also gotten
super spicy ones like the ghost pepper
one the Reaper one
I'm also salivating for the record they
also make barbecue sauce hot sauce and a
spice rub their Carolina Reaper hot
sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in
the world I can attest to that the ghost
pepper
just kidding it's the Carolina Reaper
duh it's called Carolina Reaper hot
sauce and you can use offer code LTT to
save 10% on all of their products
legitimately looks like a piece of bacon
it is B the bacon what do you think it
was oh well what's it Oh bacon jerky
it's bacon jerky oh I didn't know that
was a thing it's a thing it's a good
thing all right jumping into our next
topic or into our next monster this is
also a good thing so ek has introduced
the Phoenix and if you had noticed that
their previous modular water cooling
system sort of went away Phoenix that
name what does that mean that makes us
reborn right so this is their
next-generation improved AIO water
cooling solution it's designed around
quick disconnect couplings bringing a
modular approach to connecting and
expanding your loop so it gives you the
freedom to decide which components you
want to cool down with water and all the
products not only come with blocks and
tubing all be assembled they actually
come with water and really high-quality
quick disconnects I believe these are
some colder yeah I don't actually say on
it but I'm pretty sure when I looked
into the best quick connects way back
when I was doing like system development
back at NCIX I came across these they're
super expensive but they're like they
lose like point one or like point zero
one mils or something like that like
when you take them apart basically just
the surfaces are damp to the touch and
that's it Wow and the flow drop is
you know it's measurable sure it's
significant but it'sit's not that bad
compared to other design it's really
cool it like bridges the gap between the
super simple AI oh yeah to the more
intense enthusiast ones I like it so
it's enthusiast performance but with AI
o simplicity so they come prefilled so
you can just clip them together and the
CPU cooling module and GPU cooling
module can be connected to the radiator
core module in any order separately or
together so you can check that out an e
KY ekw be calm or through the link in
the video description bringing us to our
last sponsor wait where did where did
this thing go it's behind you yes yes oh
and behind me as well are you gonna are
you gonna do the demo like is this setup
I think the plan is to do a demo oh okay
oh well is this is this spoiling the
video alright not fine doing good okay
so our third sponsor for today is Sewell
direct their HD link HL 24 HDMI over any
two conductors product allows you to use
whatever cable you've already got
somewhere like maybe you've already got
wires running through a wall or whatever
you can use any two cables to send an
HDMI signal it's gone up to a two-mile
range with a good conductor and it can
work on literally anything that is
conductive so James is about to demo it
we hope in water so we've got a laptop
behind me James is in the way of it so
it's kind of hard for you guys to see I
think you just can't see it it's way
over there oh look you can see the
keyboard there you got a laptop we've
got a wire right here going into a tray
of water and then we've got blinky green
light is this just on the wrong input
they'd be then we've got James trying to
do a live demo any time you try and do a
live demo it doesn't work it's like it's
got to be like some kind of law Colton
did you that's not cool
Wow not gonna be your problem
it wasn't even set to duplicate oh eh do
mine well we've got a video coming where
we did have it working it's receiving
signal the problem is the monitor that's
weird why yeah definitely we're getting
enough for sure here we go yeah no no
that's cuz I power cycle though doing no
I don't know I don't know why it's not
working is it trying to run it not 1080p
or something like I don't know what's
going on here alright in the meantime
why don't I do another topic do you want
to do you want to try and fix it or oh
oh we've got the monitor we used
yesterday right there go alright next up
this is apparently old news but the Xbox
one is getting free sync the original
article here is from Forbes let's go
ahead and pull that up and this is
absolutely huge news from my perspective
I'm so thrilled about this because on
the PC side of things if you're not able
to hit 60 frames per second then okay
like that sucks but worst case scenario
there is a solution you can spend more
money I guess I know that's one of the
criticisms of PC gaming is that it's
kind of a sinkhole when it comes to how
much you can end up spending on it but
at least there is a solution with a
console if you want to play some kind of
a console exclusive and it happens to
have you know hitches and the anima
animations or it happens to not run
completely smoothly at 60fps some games
are coming out that do actually allow
you to alter the detail levels but not
everything does so this is great the
Xbox 1s and the Xbox one acts are both
going to get free sync support so on a
supported display with HDMI 2.1 you'll
be able to use free sync 2 which means
that if you
to dip in your framerate the TV's
refresh rate will actually drop to match
it perfectly which has a real world very
significant benefit to the smoothness of
the animations now right now James when
we recorded this initially the first
time because we had to restart the show
a couple of times due to audio issues
James brought up that right now there
are no TVs on the market with support
for the HDMI 2.1 but you know from my
perspective you have to start somewhere
and I mean I would I yeah okay so that
is a bit of a drag I'll give you that
but you got to start somewhere and at
least this gives us an opportunity to
move towards that in the future I mean
especially trying to run like games at
4k on you know nothing against the Xbox
1x great console got a really positive
review here but trying to run games at
4k on anything is demanding right now
and trying to run them on the Xbox one X
is well particularly demanding this has
the potential to be a real game-changer
in terms of animation smoothness on
consoles that actually leads kind of
nicely into another topic we have here
which is that the Nvidia g-sync 4k 144
Hertz monitor is that you may have seen
at CES last year in 2017 but which were
subsequently delayed are supposed to
finally being being released in April
but the question why I think this is
there was a good segue there is like
what the heck what card are you gonna
use to run something in 4k at 144 Hertz
right now the only Oh at 144 Hertz
oh nothing like you're not gonna get
anything yeah it's the frame rate about
hi to use it's kind of a funny product
because it's like it's kind of like the
product for no one so it's high frame
rate or a high refresh rate for like
eSports titles but then no one playing
League of Legends is actually running at
4k like you you just you just wouldn't
do that
why would you like I would rather if I
was a pro gamer if I was a programmer
I'm not if I was I would rather have 240
Hertz at 1080p and from my understanding
a lot of pros don't actually prefer
these gigantic large format displays
because it actually makes it so that
they can't see everything that they need
to see at once it seems to me like it's
just the first product that has this
suite of features that they're all gonna
have eventually they're just first yeah
and then the flip side of that is if
you're more into like the sightseeing
games you don't need the refresh rate
you don't need that refresh rate because
you're not gonna be running those kinds
of games at more than like 60 frames per
second now
with that said though we don't know how
the upcoming GPUs whether it be they
ampere or Volta or whatever Nvidia ends
up calling their GTX I guess whatever
they end up calling them we don't know
how powerful they're gonna they're gonna
be so that might be even the Buffalo
Bacon's got a little bit of spice and it
kind of went down my windpipe there I'm
good I'm okay I'm not gonna die on one
gel I don't know anything about why
these monitors were delayed but could it
have been to do with the HDMI 2.1 spec
like is this thing gonna use two cables
or wow these are DisplayPort so as far
as I know and this is just based on
rumors that I read on the Internet as
far as I know it has to do with delays -
in videos latest g-sync module ok you
know what I think I giveaway was 144
Hertz correct me if I'm wrong but I
think even hdmi 2.1 is max out of 120
that might be right back check that I'm
still alive I'm still alive everyone's
like rip lgt in the chat no I'm still
alive I'm okay well then all right in
the meantime why don't we go on to your
big your big topic here
well so this happened I was supposed to
buy delicious
on the forum the original article here
is from rt.com the first pedestrian
death has been not just like it's not
just happened but has been recorded from
a self-driving car well naturally the
thing this is really sad so 49 year-old
Elaine
Herzberg was struck by the self-driving
Oberer last Sunday night at 10:00 p.m.
it was dark out she was crossing the
street with her bike in Tempe Arizona
naturally a lot of these self-driving
car testing projects are in Arizona they
made some attractive terms for to
attract companies and they have pretty
nice weather it's kind of easier the car
was going 40 miles per hour an hour
which is 65 kilometers and this is an
SUV it's a Volvo xc90 SUV so there was a
backup safety net kind of driver a human
driver in the vehicle and when the story
broke we didn't have the footage of what
the camera saw the dashcam footage as it
were so we didn't know why didn't the
backup driver react well I didn't the
human driver hit the brakes how was it
possible that this woman was struck the
original details were just like
irrelevant things like it was dark out
and she wasn't a crosswalk neither of
those had any impact of whether or not
the car should stop
so Bella dine lidar said it won't be
advising its customers to halt tests in
the wake of this death because they
don't believe the accident was due to
the lidar which often it works even
better at night due to less interference
less noise they think it's possible they
don't design the software Hoover does so
it's possible that it's how the data was
handled in the software end it's still
unknown why the car didn't stop when the
dashcam footage was released it became
clear that there was if the dashcam
footage looks like what it really looked
like that night there's no way a human
could have reacted she basically is not
there and then they're like she is
crossing the street like in a shadow or
something like that
even though the driver there's interior
car footage and you can see that the
driver is looking down and not paying
attention even if they were paying
attention there's nothing they could do
and a lot of the media was focusing on
the driver and how this person has like
a previous criminal record and whether
or not boobers like policies like should
have hired them it's completely
irrelevant what we were wondering now
it's like obviously this is a big
setback for the self-driving car
community in industry and what's gonna
happen in California California was
about to initiate programs like this
there so it might take a little longer
so uber has halted tests in San
Francisco Phoenix Pittsburgh and Toronto
man like so here's the thing on the one
hand you're gonna have the I forget the
terms for them but you're gonna have the
the the pragmatists that are gonna go
well you know what's one human life in
the grand scheme of how many can be
saved in an autonomous future but I'll
chariot thank you but on the other hand
if this was like my kid like there's no
no amount of no no amount of like other
people getting to survive in the future
does anything to make this any better
for me
and from my perspective like I'm reading
an article like this and this is us
someone who really wants to see
self-driving cars succeed and wants to
buy one as soon as humanly possible I'm
glad they're not allowing testing here
in my neighborhood you know as soon as I
read this I go well I'm glad this is
being I'm glad someone else is the
guinea pig and maybe that's the wrong
way to think about it but well this is
exactly why I said her name and age in
this story here because when I posted
this on my Twitter when it first broke
it was like I expected a lot more varied
comments than I got the only comments
were like you know in the future it'll
be good but this is like a real person
so regardless of state to say the tests
that occur without a driver present in
the car which are I believe legally
allowed in Arizona yeah but we're on the
cusp of being allowed in California are
gonna be delayed man that's rough uh in
other news Oh Congress passes cesta
slash FASTA which sounds like like like
kind of like a hip bill that's like a
pasta bill you know it's like pretty
foster you man
yeah awesome actually we should start
using it as like a cuss word yo that's
pretty fast asan okay yeah I'm down yeah
I think Foster this should mean good
like geebo means bad like oh that is
some fastest no you think it's good
faster faster yeah I could see cess by
just saying like zesty yeah but that
okay yeah no come on man
this is a bill that ostensibly curbs
online sex trafficking but there are
some critics that say it's gonna
increase online censorship stifle
innovation and make everyone less safe
online so progress past it it's just
they're just waiting for presidents
Trump's signature for it to come along I
can't imagine him not signing anything
that he can list in like his
accomplishments like I actually think he
would sign anything mind you with that
said I think the the news that I looked
at most recently said that he'd might
not sign the the bill that funds the
government for the next year or whatever
the omnibus bill or whatever they're
calling it right anyway whole other
whole other conversation so here's
here's the here's the issue that they
okay so on the one hand if we're
actually preventing human trafficking by
by creating what is in effect sort of a
responsibility on these websites for the
content that B is being posted by third
parties if we are actually helping
people by doing that that's a good thing
the problem is that what this creates is
a burden on website owners and operators
to be responsible for everything that is
posted on their sites not just
everything that is present on their
sites on an ongoing basis but everything
that is posted on their sites and as
someone who hosts a user-submitted
content forum I can tell you right now
it is basically freakin impossible to
police every single thing that someone
might post on a website Craigslist has
already removed its personal section for
fear of a cesta transgression that would
affect the entire site which
demonstrates right there that the
community is interpreting this as too
heavy of a touch to do you want a risk
yeah to even want to want to like have a
chance of running afoul of and that's a
big part of their website the personals
ad is a is not a trivial part of
Craigslist really tell me more oh you
know that's how we met no I don't think
we posted our a job posting on
Craigslist and what certainly wasn't
impersonal job posting oh boy and then
so the argument though is that well you
know if you have a site you should be
responsible for what's on it and so you
know companies like Facebook or Twitter
for example might be able to build you
know AI or algorithmic protection
mechanisms to keep offensive content
from being posted but one of the
arguments against cestus that says it
could stifle innovation is that small
companies like say for example
floatplane Media Inc might not what's
that might not have access to expert
lawyers and the same kinds of monitoring
algorithms that a large company would
and might just run the risk of having to
say you know what look we can't afford
to get
buried in legal fees because we're like
enabling online sex trafficking because
like something went up on our site and
we didn't see it for 20 minutes and they
might just shut down which could hurt
the ability of the next Facebook
competitor to spring up out of nowhere
which I mean you know I don't think
anyone sees anything on the horizon like
that but putting more barriers in place
is not the solution and and I can tell
you right now like it's already
challenging so floatplane had a heck of
a time getting credit card payments
approved first the payment processor and
this is all because of their
underwriting bank that was requesting
all this crap anyway blockchain so their
pit so their payment processor wanted to
see a finished site before they would
give us access to the actual API hooks
to integrate into the site bit of a
chicken and egg thing isn't it what are
you develop a whole site and then have a
payment processor go and say you know
that blue that's a little too blue um
you know we're gonna pass we're just
gonna pass so they wanted that then we
had to get on this conference call with
them where we had to explain a couple of
things number one is how we were going
to write how we were going to monitor
user posted content and we're kind of
sitting here going well like it's it's
it's us like our sister company and like
our friend Kyle that are uploading to
right now like I don't think this is
gonna be an issue that count like
comments are under that umbrella are
they not yes but comments are a little
bit easier to moderate because you can
but again though it comes down to
imposing on websites the the the
restriction that you'll just have to
kind of narrow down like you'll have to
effectively make the comments a little
less open and a little less free because
we could crack down on people being able
to post gifs for example or we could
crack down on people being able to post
links links those are those are pretty
easy ways to keep you know
traffic and a spam filter for certain
diction yep um but but that will that
will make an effect our comments more
sensor than we otherwise might have
preferred to have them so anyway the
other than the other thing we wanted to
know is what our plan was to keep adult
content off the site Merc is sitting
here going look I'm not gonna name any
names because I'm just it's just been it
has really been that kind of week um I
hope he's been fine I don't great good
so I just don't like I don't want to I
want to get into it but we're kind of
going ok hey there's nothing in your
Terms of Service this is anything about
adult content for one thing to which
their response was well we can't keep
our Terms of Service updated at all
times I can't go what are you what are
you talking about they're like well you
know that's why we have us to explain
the internal terms of service to people
and I'm like so you have internal terms
of surface and external terms of service
here's an idea why don't you just have
one terms of so what else is on that
internal terms of service great question
what it would it would a tremendous
question that you have well what a great
audience yeah um and so we want one okay
you don't have that in your Terms of
Service and two we know for a fact that
there's at least one major site that
does offer adult content that uses you
as a payment processor and has for years
more that's why what is the deal
and anyway after the whole the whole
interrogate interview process we did
manage to get approved we're getting the
code integrated naturally the sandbox
API is totally doesn't jive with the
actual one so it wasn't just plug and
play like it's supposed to be but that's
why Luke's not here he's working clean
that right now but we're hoping to have
credit card processing working pretty
soon but but anyway coming back to cesta
Fausta the issue here is that putting
more barriers in in the way of small
online companies has a real impact like
every week that we spend dicking around
with some kind of regulatory thing is
another week
that we can't be developing products and
services that make creators and their
viewers happy and it's very frustrating
with that said you know the human
trafficking is a travesty and a living
nightmare for the people that are
involved in it well on the one end of it
not the other end I don't think I think
they're probably probably sleep fine at
night somehow and you know you want to
see something done about it but it just
doesn't really seem like this is it
here's another non-answer there are an
on way to go this is kind of related
have you seen this this is state
legislation pending in Rhode Island
which would force Internet service
providers to block sexual content by
default until the Internet user does the
following requests in writing that the
capability be disabled presents
identification to verify that that
particular user is 18 years old or older
acknowledges receiving like you've got
to wait for something to mail that
receive a written warning regarding the
potential danger of deactivating the
digital blocking capability of this
sexual content and page twenty bucks as
a digital access fee I don't know about
you but if I really wanted to look at
porn on the internet
hey I wouldn't pay $20 for it and be I
could not wait that long and yes we
didn't talk about this last week all
right well it still sucks for anyone in
Rhode Island all right
so this is supposed to by sc2 Mitch on
the forum Elon Musk has gotten involved
in hashtag
no way so the original article here is
from the Guardian hit us with the facts
on this well this is lazer James this is
the deep context source this is like if
you don't know why Facebook's in trouble
to begin with we're going here so what
happened was Facebook sees itself as a
platform instead of just an ad company
so they don't care about giving away
tons of personal data which would be
very valuable to an ad company like
Google they don't mind giving that away
to developers who are gonna develop
Facebook apps because they want to be a
platform like Microsoft so what they did
starting around 2010 was if you're
building an app for Facebook you can get
access to a ton of profile data and not
just data from the people who use these
apps but data from their friends so what
happened was a psychologist professor at
Cambridge made an app paid a couple
hundred thousand people to take a survey
which is what the app was for thereby
getting access to all those users data
on Facebook and all their friends which
amounted to about 50 million different
profiles worth of personal data that
data then was against Facebook Terms of
Service given to Cambridge analytical a
company it's against the Terms of
Service because once you get this data
you're not allowed to use it for any
advertising purpose which is what
Cambridge analytical ended up doing they
use it to make highly targeted ads to
target these people in a very specific
way all these 50 million people they
served ten thousand different nuanced
ads to to kind of sway the American
election well attempt to attempt to sway
it can't prove it worked we don't know
we're not experts so now this has all
come to light Facebook's in trouble
a famous hashtag delete Facebook has
been started by one of the people who
benefited tremendously from Facebook the
founder one of the cofounders of
whatsapp Brian Acton he started delete
Facebook hashtag he and then
Elon Musk uh called out about the delete
Facebook hashtag and he said oh that
exists okay let's just take down our
SpaceX and Tesla Facebook pages which
they've done and we don't know if musk
is trolling cuz he kind of does that or
if he believes in the cause or what in
other news
we got rekt by gamers Nexus what the
heck what you talking about look at this
we were number five serve gunslinger and
gamers Nexus all knocked us off of the
leaderboard for the NVIDIA Titan be-what
leaderboard is this this is 3d mark on
sly extreme Oh that rat bastard hmm well
no promises that will take another crack
at it but I don't like seeing I don't
like seeing that Canadian flag all the
way down there that's no fun that's weak
sorry this everyone's up 7 baby yeah
dude yes but-- oh but no penalty no
comments on the Facebook thing it was
quite a segue you just handed me um no I
don't I don't really have anything to
say on that one
apparently the audio is a mess again I
don't even know I don't even know what
to tell people um I want talk about
ray-tracing no I don't know elses day
you know what I'm done all right I got
enough in this week so goodbye forever
until next week same bat-time same
bat-channel
goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
