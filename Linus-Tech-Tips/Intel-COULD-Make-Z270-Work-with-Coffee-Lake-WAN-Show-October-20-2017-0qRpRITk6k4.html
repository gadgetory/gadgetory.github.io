we're gonna get our spacing right here
there we go perfect oh you always push
me away from the mic so you're way
louder than me
no I'm wait ladder than you because I'm
weight ladder than you I pushed you away
from the mic because I'm the one who's
actually you know looking at the show
and okay look symmetric you know what
here just a second hold on let me let me
let me explain let me let me explain
something something here let's go ahead
we'll we'll give you guys some screen
capture to look at here instead of James
there you go okay so oh that that really
doesn't work very well what I'm doing
right now okay that's not really the
point the point is look at the distance
here see this distance not enough
distance you got a fair see I'm not sure
isn't there was a no mansplaining rule
on the wine show no no you're allowed to
win spleen that's we've been through
this so we've got a lot of great topics
for you guys today topic number one
where is Luke which is I'm sure the only
one that you actually care about at this
point cuz this frickin can you take
those off I'm not taking them off oh you
have to take them on man I feel like JC
Denton he's not using the laser
okay so Edie can you can you come up for
us for a second here can you just show
them what the heck is going on such that
James figures he needs Wow thank you I'm
sure glad I had a professional camera
operator do that that's much appreciated
so that right there look at that he
knows how to use the focus ring and
everything
so that right there is our new laser
cutter and these no no no you can't wear
them the whole show let me tell you the
whole the whole sunglasses during a tech
video podcasting has been done no one
likes it my vision is augmented have you
even played Deus Ex
this is sick this is harsh
I have played hold on a second which one
is
Pacific wave looks like yeah it cuts out
all the BS and leaves you with awesome
no can you know no can I at least just
continually put them on like
periodically throughout the show you can
only keep them on for a maximum of 30
seconds at a time deal star okay and and
they have a ten minute cool down cool
down by the way yes I have played Deus
Ex but I only played the widely regarded
as kind of crap sequels little war I
actually enjoyed it having not played
the original and never playing one since
I actually really enjoyed it yeah I
really don't want to miss badminton this
guy's trying to send me on a freaking
also you didn't Center our camera way to
go add or did he no not quite it needs
to go a little bit more towards James
thank you he's trying to send me on a
business trip during my badminton night
I get one night a week one night a week
when I get to go out and do something
fun and this guy wants to send me to
where are you trying to send me LA
one syllable cities that's two syllables
LA all right so we've got a lot of great
topics for you guys today
gigabyte responded via email I hope I
hope I hope I can talk about this I
think it's kind of a it was kind of a
statement so they responded via email to
my question about exactly what the heck
is going on with motherboard or with
coffee leak performance from motherboard
to motherboard and I've also heard from
a sous so we'll be talking a little bit
about that Activision has patented a
technique for social engineering
microtransactions in games I love it
it's way more evil than it sounds and it
sounds pretty damn evil so that should
give you some idea what else we got
oh I can talk now yeah yeah yeah ah
reportedly Apple has cut down production
of the iPhone 8 for November and
December by a large margin
Wow cut cuts axed and a pixel to excel
color issued that last may or may not
have experienced I actually want to know
I'll get there you know what I haven't
okay yeah you know what why don't we
roll the in trouble talk about it later
we'll talk about it later
Juancho and it will also do that first
topic I promised where is Luke
I'm wearing the song of us and that with
the 30 seconds doesn't count until I am
sure you have one fan have or x95 likes
you
lots of people like me yeah let's not
get ahead of ourselves you have one pen
that's not true
oh do you want me to send you
screenshots daraa bullets James just
know that guy doesn't count that's a
child die wolf lost where is Luke that's
cuz he's pleasantly surprised to see me
then blogger says you're sick and I
think he means like disgusting not like
good that's both those are both good to
me no sponsors I forgot we were silly
intro intro scream there I don't know
how I'd manage it how hard is this okay
this much frame it's like there's like
this much extra I always tell the camera
people I'm like can you censor the arm
in the frame and they're like yes and
then they don't do it I think they're
just messing with me I think at this
point people are actually just screwing
with me when they do things wrong
alright so why don't we get into coffee
like performance first have you looked
have you heard about this have you seen
this for yes I read egg so it comes down
to a feature yeah that is enabled by
default on some boards but not enabled
by default on others yep so a Susa
statement was actually I'm gonna have a
quick look at my email here and make
sure that this is on the record because
it's one of those frustrating things
where sometimes we actually we actually
know more than we can say because
industry contacts don't want to get
themselves in trouble mind you there's a
pretty funny story actually about a soos
and being sort of on the record when you
thought you weren't on the record no no
no tama√±o
no what am i I'm not going to being on
the record when you didn't realize
you're on the record and saying
something that kind of through Intel
under the bus we'll get to that later
but first up yes I actually asked do you
guys have an official statement on the
whole Auto overclocking thing so the
whole discrepancy between it was a
especially visible and heavily
multi-threaded tests like Cinebench
between you know one reviewers results
with coffee lake and another's where
people were getting up to like 300 point
differences in Cinebench seems to have
come down to some motherboard
manufacturers most notably a sous
enabling a feature by default on their
boards that effectively overclocks the
cpu right out of the box running all of
the cores at the maximum turbo rather
than just one or two or however many
were supposed to be enabled at that
particular speed so I asked and this is
my subject line so I think I've absolved
myself of any responsibility for this
being something that can't go out to the
public for an official statement from
Asus on the whole auto overclocking
thing but I actually you know what I
should probably talk about gigabyte
statement first so they proactively sent
this to me and they're basically just
like good luck no no I can read this
they're basically just like hey I just
watched your ran show that's that's cool
gigabyte watches the lan show like you
guys are the way and show you guys make
the news I'm just like blah blah blah
like this about it just wanted to
comment on the variants and scores
there's been some discussion over Intel
turbo policy and enhanced multi-core
performance I'm sure you are aware this
is a feature that pegs all cores at the
max turbo frequency so in the case of
the 8700 K this is 4.7 gigahertz across
all course now something that's really
happened over the last couple of
generations of Intel's turbo boost
technology is that the difference
between base clock and max turbo clock
has increased a lot so it used to be
that if you had a multi-core enhancement
feature and you just boosted everything
it was just a little bit and the reason
they've done that is so they can get
higher efficiency better battery life
some higher efficiency CPUs overall yeah
basically so the idea is that Intel's
going okay well here's what we're
comfortable rating it for when all the
cores are operating and we want to tune
it better and better and better for
lightly threaded workloads so you can
get more performance out of just like a
game that only utilizes one or two cores
or any other single threaded application
so you can
but they wouldn't have rated the CPU for
4.7 gigahertz on all the course at the
thermal and at the power consumption
targets that they have so there's gonna
be a stability issue there and that's
what this person from gigabyte is
hinting at yeah the reason they don't
you know don't put it on by default
there's potential for stability issue
because it is in effect overclocking and
it produces more heat and so this is why
our 8700 K review had our chip consuming
a lot of power compared to what we might
have expected and we probably should
have investigated that further so we
were using an asus board we were using
an asus board so we've typically used
asus boards for our launch coverage of
any new CPU for I don't know the last
five fiver skills and CPU launches see
yeah we drinks water to buy himself time
I drink asus water but the reality of it
is that we've found it has really more
to do with the pre-review support for us
the fact that we can email anytime night
or day and we're getting a response
within like 20 minutes and that has
really made our lives a lot easier when
we're trying to iron out what are often
bugs with the CPU with the RAM with the
board being able to get new biases that
address these or get answers when there
is no BIOS to address it helps us out a
lot and that's the main reason that
we've been doing that so we had a we
were running the board at default which
we assumed is kind of okay so here's
here's my response from from isus well
we've been doing it that way for a few
years so they're basically saying I like
hey this isn't really anything new so I
really don't know what there is to say
we the motherboard makers in general
this is kind of the statement we get
slammed for enabling it then we all
disable it then we get slammed for not
doing it because it's kind of free
performance and kind of within spec then
we place warnings on enabling it and
that gets ignored so I guess now we're
back to not enabling it where
some new BIOS updates next week do you
have an opinion on whether or not they
should enable it I'm standing here I
think you should have it off by default
it's still a feature that's included it
is just a switch you turn on and the
BIOS so it's easy to do if people those
long people know about it that you're
not losing out on that free performance
you'd still have it available to you if
you want it but how would people know
about it I would argue that the average
user even the average user who builds
their own computer isn't gonna touch a
feature called multi-core enhancement
sounds pretty sweet to me yeah it sounds
pretty sweet but there's also like a lot
of stuff within a BIOS that might seem
sweet on the surface but you turn it on
and your computer doesn't boot anymore
until you you know because remember
you're a novice user you go into your
manual you figure out what the hell up
see most reset is you go find that
stupid button or header and you you know
15 minutes 30 minutes later you've got
your computer back on you can't go oh
well I'm not gonna touch any of that
stuff anymore it would come down to
marketing but you can't market something
that's just yeah I guess you kind of you
can but they don't want you using that
anyway like if you're a Seuss or
gigabyte or em aside they've all got
over Auto overclocking tools that are
much more sophisticated than that built
into their boards that are like turning
up the speed testing it to make sure
it's okay turning it up some more
testing it again and they want you using
that stuff so how do those features
reconcile with this feature if you
haven't both on um it's a good question
truthfully haven't played around with it
a whole lot yeah so honestly I don't
really plan to because I don't really
personally recommend either of them as
the most optimal way to overclock I
still believe that doing it manually
yourself is the best way to overclock so
yeah apparently we're slightly out of
focus I just I don't even I don't even
know I don't even know why we have
camera people anymore
speaking of which I need a camera person
right now alex is taking the well oh wow
taking WoW focus wheel
actually that's not bad damn girl that's
not you should have seen the celli he
just did I can't do it but he did that
that come come show them that weird
thing that you do give us this alley it
weirds me out I look great you only do
it twice alright the next one oh yeah
let's take care activision I don't want
to do that topic oh I do those yeah well
do that topic alright alright alright
we'll talk about it so this was
originally posted by WM groom a K on the
forum the original article here is
actually from Rolling Stone of all
publications well there was a more
original one but it the site had that
slideshow format so I wasn't messing
with that okay so James how on a scale
of one to AIDS Plus cancer plus leprosy
where would you put activism
Activision's research into using
matchmaking tricks so you guys know in
game matchmaking like pairing at one
party with another using in game
matchmaking tricks to sell in-game items
if I work there if I'm an executive or a
shareholder this is awesome do you own
shares Oh sick inactivation no I don't
okay so then how do you feel about
gaming perspective it's all over folks
throwing the towel games suck from now
on this is a brutal direction there is
some good news they've actually patented
the technique so not all games suck
hopefully no one else can do this just
all the huge major titles from this
giant company so okay let's get into
this Activision was granted a patent
this month for a system it uses to
influence players in multiplier games to
purchase game items through micro
transactions so the system uses it
alters the matchmaking process
so typically players are putting the
games together based on a wide variety
of factors including skill level
internet latency and your availability
friends the way it should be you should
be skilled so that everyone's playing a
fun round of you know
counter go source or whatever it is that
the kids are playing these days right
but now they've added a rune craft extra
vector yeah
this extra vector of market into the
matchmaking process that basically tries
to get you in the game with people who
have bought stuff that you haven't
bought yet so that psychologically you
kind of see them using it and you want
to buy it
and it also so the the article also
describes part of the technique being to
take inexperienced players and
intentionally put them in close
proximity to players who are good at a
skill that they aspire to be good at and
who have an item that appears to be
related to that skill so let's say that
a really skilled player has like a great
sniper rifle for example then they're
gonna they're gonna pair this player who
and you can you can tell so much about
people from the way that the game
actually well you mean you can tell a
lot about how how they want a game
anyway so someone's like always playing
sniper classes but sucks you can tell I
don't even think it's skill level I
aspire to be a sniper
no no well there's that too there's
there's multiple aspects of it right so
they'll take like an unskilled sniper
who wants to be good at sniping they'll
put them near a good sniper who has
great equipment like hat of plus one
that they favor bot or whatever um stuff
that they paid for that they paid for
and kind of watch right and then
continually retool it and re optimized
to get more people buying
microtransactions if my children ever
pay for an in-game item I'm cutting them
off they're out of the will they're
gonna be out dude they're out of the
will that's gonna happen really soon you
guys heard it here first out of the will
can I get in there because digital like
in-game items I don't know see you were
old school we energy kind of cool we
used to justify a game and have the
whole game then expansion packs came out
and that was just bonus and awesome then
it all went to and now it's poo
video DLC is just like how you get the
whole game okay
hold on hold on so what I realized when
I was talking about cutting my kids out
of the will is that I think I've
actually bought digital items before no
I know I know so they won't be cut out
of the will but but but if they spend
too much on them what's two months and
they're cut out of the world that can be
written in the will too much is too much
is you know I think I think more than
you know what that is a really good
straw poll question once you okay so I
wanna I want to frame this in a pretty
specific manner because there's a couple
of different ways you can define too
much like I would take a free-to-play
game where the in-game items are purely
cosmetic and it's not a pay to win and I
would kind of look at it and go you know
what buying a skin or - or a character
here and there to support the developer
who's running a free-to-play game but
has a lot of cost associated with it
big-time
probably okay but if we're talking
triple a title like we're talking like a
$69.99 oh yeah $79.99 triple a title or
or worse yet like a collector's edition
that came in a tin so you've like
already spent a hundred and thirty
hundred and fifty bucks on this thing
and you can't even put the Master Chief
helmet on because it's actually mini
right and you run out and you blow like
another 50 bucks hundred bucks on it I
think that is totally different so I
want to create a specific scenario for
you guys because we're talking
Activision Blizzard here so we are not
talking about free-to-play games okay
you pay for the game so so let's say
let's say a $50 game just for the sake
of argument okay I know that's almost
nothing is 50 bucks anymore it's either
more because it's triple-a or it's like
20 30 bucks because it's indie but let's
say $50 game acceptable amount to spend
on microtransactions I think you should
attach a time frame here because if I'm
playing wow for like 6 years and I spent
$300 whatever but if this is a period of
6 months or something like that
okay yeah that's fair career first year
let's do per year
okay so first a for you hard course out
there I'm putting in the zero dollar
option okay don't worry I'm putting in
the zero dollar option
okay Coors or cheapskates okay so I've
got uh okay while you set that up I want
to talk about another thing that this
algorithm does that's a this even just
takes it to the next level once you do
make an in-game purchase so they put you
in a match the expert sniper
you were totally attracted to it you
ended up buying this sniper rifle once
you made that purchase they're then
going to take actions that make you feel
good about that purchase they don't want
you to regret the purchase so on your
next match they're gonna put you in a
game where you're you're not in a close
quarters match you're gonna be put in a
game where that purchase is advantageous
they're gonna put you in Blood Gulch or
whatever a sniper friendly match so you
can actually that's the last time you
played that's old-school man people like
the chef that I like the throwbacks I
know what it is oh yeah it means it's
old-school that's a classic blood goes
to me they make that map for different
times it's in every game every Halo game
okay anyway they're gonna put you in
blood into a map where you switch chat
is flipping out to Blood Gulch they love
it Wow okay okay go go go go go fire
James fire James okay that guy is too
young to know of luck I'll just you
should be getting an Xbox on eBay just
so you can play it even if you weren't
born yet and you may need a line this
tech tips halo 1 server Booya agreed
that'd be sweet okay do you guys you
guys would be down ok I'm not so old
school that I am advocating using like
the original fatty controller that
controller sucked you're allowed to use
the xix control shil Gulch she'll go go
go
halo 1 is still like $30 Gulch tip you
can still buy it
halo 1 customers just $30
in forever it's terrible terrible um
okay all right all right imma let you
finish i'ma let you finish but basically
the thing that sucks about this is that
you can tell from the language in the
patent that this is not just going to be
affecting in-game purchases like skins
and aesthetic things yeah the language
talks about weapons and that just means
that the developers are going to have a
monetary incentive to make it play to
win so to me that this looks like this
is the direction we're all going thing
about this kind of play to win is it's
like a sicker more insidious play to win
because instead of it being okay instead
of it being our Desolator win pay to win
instead of me being able to pay more to
just have better crap than you and walk
in and stomp you I have to lose to you
hold on it'll be it'll be pay more and
get a fake Oh ego boost because they're
just gonna pair you with crappier
players I can imagine that when they
first roll this out trick you when they
first roll this out you're gonna be on
the team are you gonna be on the same
team as the guy with the awesome gun but
then they're gonna find out that it's
actually more effective if you're on the
opposite team and you just get lit up by
this guy with the awesome gun you're
tired of getting so pwned that you you
go and buy the gun yourself and then you
get to the awesome feeling of wrecking
noobs I mean at what point do they then
take it a step further and they start
actually fooling you into thinking
you're playing against people you're not
like what if they could use like a
neural network to figure out which
people in game you actually know and
which people you don't so they could
have you playing against the guy you're
playing against the guy who's ripping
you apart with a sniper rifle from the
other side of the map okay
um or the guy that like literally gets
out of the Banshee and like manages to
drop it on you every time Oh terrible
it's all halo all the time so hail all
the time from now on okay and then in
your next game they just like overlay
that person's real avatar and real
on-screen name with like this guy and
you like destroy him now that you bought
your new gun
do you think they could get that evil
why not I mean it's just a no it's just
a digital identity that it actually is
actually ultimately pretty meaningless
as far as it goes if they take two
randoms who don't know each other they
just sprinkle Boston just sprinkle
super-advanced BOTS and that just are
just pimped out swagged out they got the
guns are shooting hot pink bullets I
think you know is this where we're going
holy crap ah jeez this leads us pretty
squarely into another topic we have
that's it all right yes it does
speaking of AI that's just so killer it
can wreck you every time remember
alphago the deep neural Neck net that
managed to swamp all the world's top
alpha our top go players in the last
year ah so this is from Gizmodo here
there you go all right
tell me about it okay so alphago the
first artificial intelligence to defeat
a grandmaster at the game go just got a
major upgrade in a tournament that
pitted AI versus AI the regular alphago
got completely completely wrecked 100
games to zero by the new version of
alphago
called alphago zero why did they call it
alphago zero if it gets a hundred and
not zero because of singularity baby how
is zero singular what you're not the
singularity is yeah it's like converging
to 0 I'm making this up what I'm trying
to justify the names you're talking
about okay the thing that's cool about
this is the original alphago had a
training data set of thousands of
previously played go games played by
humans that were amateurs or
professionals that go this is a
completely unsupervised like
reinforcement learning algorithm that
had no training data set no training
data set it started only with the rules
of the game go and in three days could
beat the original go then it's saying so
it played 4.9 million games against
itself to acquire the expertise needed
to beat the original alphago for
comparison the original alphago had 30
million games for inspiration Wow after
40 days it defeated a more sophisticated
version of alphago called alphago master
and that was the version that defeated
the world's best go players last year it
gets even crazier it did this not only
is it better it's not even that they
just like threw more computing power on
it it's way more efficient the original
alphago master had 48 TP use or tensor
processing units this one 440 P use
that's an order of magnitude more
efficient now this is like not generally
AI at all yeah this is playing a game
but it's like it's it's yeah okay hmm
well this thing could wreck you at Halo
- I don't know K it'll smash you with
banshees every time you're getting stuck
from across the map noscope headshots
alright one more topic before we go into
ads this was originally posted by Jami
scone
Jimmy's Jamie's gone whatever on the
forum Jamie's original Oh Jamie is gone
the original article is from kit guru
dotnet no I don't want your
notifications Apple reportedly cut down
iPhone 8 production already I mean if it
if it wasn't a strong enough indication
that iPhone 8 isn't doing particularly
well that there were literally no
lineups like that was a big thing with
the iPhone 8 launch this seems to be
this seems to pretty much drive the
point home
apparently iPhone 8 and 8 plus
production has been reduced by about 50%
for November in December which are
typically pretty strong sales months for
mobile devices and this is what
apparently the first time Apple has
reduced iPhone production
so early in the cycle this is really
worrying considering like the bright
side of this would be to assume that all
these people who aren't buying the eight
are just waiting to buy the ten but but
they probably won't even be able to buy
the ten and the other issue is that
apparently a lot of people are opting
for the iPhone 7 instead of the 8 which
is frankly a decision that ok a makes a
lot of sense to me in the first place
because the iPhone 7 inator really not
very different you're getting way more
eyes per dollar and number 2 the more
people go out there and buy the iPhone 7
the longer the support cycle we are
likely to see on that product because
and this is this is something that I
that actually comes up fairly often when
I'm talking about you know what tech
product you should buy a lot of the time
it doesn't work out to be in your best
interest to go and buy the most
expensive motherboard because a lot of
the time what can end up happening is
because they sell so few units of that
model it might end up with a very short
support cycle and a much smaller install
base of people to call in to tech
support and complain if something goes
wrong they might end up with more
compatibility issues down the line
because of that smaller install base
installing a wide variety of hardware to
you know find out if there's any issues
and report them to the manufacturer so
owning the like the popular one can
actually be really good because the
iPhone 7 here's another thing if there's
a huge install base even not directly
from Apple even if we're talking from
app developers if there's a huge install
base of these iPhone 7s because Apple
was effectively selling them for two
years at full paw or at full speed then
you're gonna see app developers really
focus on optimizing for that phone for a
longer time into the future as those
iphones start to have their screens
broken or start to be replaced it's just
gonna take longer before you aren't
worth investing in anymore so the fact
that there's this momentum on the iphone
7 become sort of a self self-reinforcing
positivity snowball and the
people realize that the iPhone 7 is a
great choice compared to the eight the
more it will be a great choice compared
to the eight that's where I was coming -
that's your positive fashionable that's
my positivity snowball so I mean I ended
up just by chance with a couple of those
types of devices so the iPad one was a
big steaming pile of beta it didn't end
up being supported for very long it was
thick the battery life sucked it was
super slow iPhone - actually I thought
good I pad okay good
iPad - way better in every way like
fantastic and made a ton of sense as a
product for quite some time because even
the ones that came after it we're adding
things like high resolution displays
that actually ended up hurting battery
life as much as they increase the
resolution of the display they ran
hotter like the iPad 2 had stuff going
for it for like three or four
generations and afterward it wasn't
until the air I think that we've got one
that was higher resolution and better
battery and RAM cooler was like better
in every possible way
so my iPad 2 ended up getting supported
almost forever
and the same with the iPad are with the
iPhone 4 and I ended up with like both
of them at the same time I was like this
is great apples well yeah like four or
five years is awesome but it doesn't
always work out like that so it's really
nice when you end up with something like
that and it looks like the iPhone 7
could be another one I personally wish
it had been the 6s because it has a
headphone jack but sorry oh oh yeah the
Apple watch what about it oh you're just
upset because you lost that playlist
feature yeah so Apple right does not
behave in this way every time you have a
second gen yeah 2nd gen yeah and just
lost a feature that was deprecated
seemingly and we have no you know
insider knowledge at Apple or anything
but seemingly to make room for a new
version of the feature that is only
available on the new one that has LTE
connectivity so you're just gonna buy
the new one aren't you
yes you are aren't you these are are you
already wearing it did you already buy
the new one did you already order it are
you going to the Apple store after this
weekend he's already on the Apple Store
right now then you'll sell that one and
get the new are you really gonna get the
new one Oh see you are everything that's
wrong with and feeling me he's one of
those Apple people you actually need
something or what can I do for you I'll
- where do i when do I have to decide
wait today I don't know probably not
let's go now I don't know we'll talk
we'll talk about it later okay ah right
right we've got to do our we've gotta do
our sponsor
a sponsor number one is I please put
those glasses on what all right try it
you'll like it I will wear they're not
even know they were stolen um I'm
serious they're not they're no sponsor
number one is I fix it I fix it is all
about the culture of repairing your own
stuff because why should you pay a
manufacturer a bunch of money or throw
something out contributing to waste in
our world when you can repair something
yourself for often a fraction of the
cost so I fixed that has tons of great
guides for taking apart repairing and
putting back together your electronic
doodads be they phones or computers and
they've got tons of amazing tools

bringing us to savage jerky
you know what Luke isn't here to make me
suffer this week we know we get it so
I'm actually just going to mal on my
favorite savage turkey the maple buffalo
bacon yes stereotypical yes it's only
it's only a two star two star
hotness level but quite frankly you know
what was my drawing power anyway do you
really think I'm more than a - OH - what
oh wait a minute is this the maple yeah
I think this is the one
like do they have more than one
maple-bacon it doesn't even offer me a
they might Wow
this is really nice to know mine well
you're vegetarian I still want to smell
the bag here you can have some of you
want unbelievable hmm oh yeah this is a
new flavor this is nice so it's like at
least waft yeah you come on yeah it's
really good you cab you probably won't
be able to sky the maple damn that
smells good you can't swear on the show
we've been through this what are you
counting as swear words now heavens to
Betsy you can say heavens to Betsy are
you sure so savage jerky is made with
the best ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives the goal was to create a
snack that's full of flavor and spice
but that isn't bad for you and they've
got 13 different flavors I'm a huge fan
of the Moho maple maple bacon that's
friggin awesome
the year is it original what they call
yeah original that one's really good the
salt and pepper tree really you know
what they're all really good and if
you're not into just tasty and you want
stuff that will like melt your mouth off
then they've got they've got Jerky's
they've also got hot sauces made with
like Carolina Reapers these are like
some of us these are some of the hottest
hottest peppers in the world trust me
they will they will let your mouth on
fire they will let your butt on fire
I can ask I'm gonna test yeah you can
use offer code ltte to save 10% on your
butt fire over at savage jerky dot-com
so that software code ltte save 10% and
all orders this week will get a koozie
or sticker if you use our code leading
us you're one of those koozie people a
koozie person you don't say cozy you say
koozie oh I I had never heard it said
aloud oh yeah you've never been to a
barbecue but no one ever invites me to
things yeah last weekend you should hear
about it on Monday when I come back Wow
speaking of you know what hold on a
second we're going to do our next one so
spot in a little bit we'll move on hold
on because I got a side rail us for a
little bit here you went to WWE this
week yeah nobody asked me about that I
went to SmackDown live I actually have
check this out check this out
here I sent an email to myself remind
myself really ask James about WWE
because here here it is here it is so I
sent this to myself on October 17 three
days ago because I the day after cuz I
was like super I was super curious what
was WD I mean you're not like a WWE fan
right no so you think it's kind of
ridiculous
I watched it as a child and then watched
it for way longer than I would have
because my friend was super into it
really no I'm just joking of course you
know it's fake it's kind of like it's
kind of slapstick II slapstick comp
there's a couple lol moments watching
you live actually none of the big super
stars that I know of were there of
course cuz they're all retired now like
stone cold it's not gonna show up so it
was all like no names to me so I felt
more like I was at like one of those
Mexican wrestling events just cuz they
were all no names and they're doing
stupid stuff and one guy actually had a
Mexican wrestling mask on so that can
you be to the feel family fun and really
pretty entertaining how much was it 20
bucks that's why I went who's sweet
alright it was sweet so tell me how
sweet was it was it sweet in a this was
a great way to turn my brain off for two
hours on a Tuesday night way or was it
great you know like I'm gonna start
finding out who these guys are in
following the storyline it's not a
chance
it was a great in the like I get to hang
out and like have dinner and spend the
evening with my childhood friend who I
only get to see like every quarter kind
of way and it was only 20 bucks he was
50 bucks wouldn't done it no not a
chance
sorry childhood friend I'd hang out with
him without but not by
I just want to Gwen to that with him but
yeah I was sweet best part was the voice
announcer guy yeah I love that like the
ability to like grab the microphone and
the you know like that lets get ready to
rhumble kind of guy are we even allowed
to say that I know we can't do it with
the intonation yes I try like trademark
yeah the intonation yeah just say it
like Stephen Hawking style ready too
much I don't even know if you can say it
at all oh my one of those things like
the whole the whole copyright on happy
birthday but actually recently was that
one was overturned but weird like nobody
even realizes that you you like can't
say this stuff cuz they'll actually go
after you you know that Rudolf was
invented by coca-cola no let that bake
your noodle for a second huh they also
made Santa Claus red enjoy coke how
about that how about up alright um okay
let's do our last sponsor spot now sorry
for that totally unrelated to side sue
will direct this is a new sponsor right
connect anything in a nutshell they sell
all sorts of audio-visual equipment
cables extenders they specialize in HDMI
cables extenders which is splitters have
speaker wire banana plugs IR remote
control extenders and they cut out the
middleman by designing and manufacturing
the products themselves which they sell
directly to you so we've got a couple of
their HDMI extenders so all these are
you okay yeah these are cool I've seen
these before
these are HDMI over cat5 adapters so
basically instead of trying to run a
super long HDMI cable which either
doesn't work or you have to get a
special active cable alright what you do
is you plug your HDMI in then you've got
this this active module here that needs
some was it yeah five volt power then
you're on Ethernet and you can actually
run it quite a lot longer than you would
be able to so this guy right here wow
this is the HL 10 I want to say let me
just double check I don't wanna say
anything incorrect
oh yeah this guy will do a hundred and
seventy-five feet with a 1080p HDMI
signal over cat5e or cat6 with zero
compression and they've got other stuff
that'll actually do
Wow 390 feet pretty cool so two senders
and two receivers each sender can be
sent to one of 64 channels by the
buttons on the front or a remote and you
can check out all this cool
oh yeah that's a sleek little monolith
that's that that's the baller one that's
the boom this is the 390 that's the HD
link hl21 HDMI extender plus matrix over
network is this the one that goes
through under 90 feet so any receiver
connected to the channel that you select
will receive the video signal
this one is h.264 compression though so
you can check out these videos are these
videos these products and more at the
URL shown on screen so you'll direct.com
slash Linus it's got that that new HDMI
over IP smell I actually like the smell
of new electronics get a sniff yep hmm
it's got that it's it's that fresh PCB
smell you know when they let me
manufacture it and then they put it into
the bag it stays all sealed in there you
know even if the bags not sealed even if
you can't get it back in the bag app
sees in there it stays in there pretty
good
alright and give up on that good good
work James um all right what else we got
here like what's interesting did you
know that Google's first system on a
chip designed in-house is in the pixel
to that you've been using all week know
you didn't know because they just
announced it now really there's a chip
in there that you don't know about the
pixel visual course this was originally
posted by Z Ramsey on the on the forum
and the original article here is from
the verge Google's first mobile chip
that's not an SOC that's an image
processor dang it what tell me the verge
is wrong hold on a second what are these
what are they saying okay hold on hold
on hold on pixel visual core SOC purple
the purpose in this case accelerated oh
okay so my understanding of the
definition of an SOC is that it has to
have basically all the elements of a
of like a more traditional like CPU
motherboard GPU I oh wow
especially among academics SOC is
sociology why don't we look for a much
more better definition Wow
it's pronounced oh Sh yeah I'm gonna
have to double-check the definition here
because I wouldn't think an image
processor would be an SOC so it
integrates all components of a computer
or other electronic system may contain
digital analog mixed signal and often
radio frequency functions all on a
single substrate okay well if they're
calling it an SOC maybe there's more to
this thing than I necessarily thought
but here we go we've actually got a
we've got a look at it here so the
coolest aspects of the pixel visual core
may be that it's already in Google's
devices they both have it built in but
laying dormant and activate yes it's
laying dormant until they activate over
the coming months so right now it's used
just to process hdr+ stuff way faster
faster than you've experienced it it
hasn't been activated yet interesting
and that's not all they're actually
gonna use it from more applications than
just that they haven't told us what but
we'll see more image and machine
learning enhancements being added to the
pixel two over the coming months very
interesting so here's a here's a look at
it so here's the course here's the link
to memory
pcie Wow ha it's super interesting to me
that they didn't announce this that
they're made by Google Hardware event I
guess they didn't have it ready in time
but they still ship devices with it they
didn't have the the software
implementation ready in time so they
just laid low until now you would have
thought they would have at least
announced it like when reviewers had
hands on so so they're saying each of
its eight processors has been tailored
to handle hdr+ duties resulting in hdr+
performance that is five times faster at
one tenth of the energy of current of
the current implementation now when they
say current implementation there do you
think they mean what your pixel can
currently do yeah before this is turned
on yeah that's smooth baby so they say
they'll enable it as a developer option
in the preview of Android Oreo 8.1 Wow
and that there's gonna party hat apps
will have the ability to handle HDR
photo so we'll see more imaging and
machine learning enhancements added to
the pixel - so the pixel - is already
getting a pretty good review that went
up on floatplane last night and will be
added to YouTube I think on Sunday is
when we're gonna see that video go live
so right now floatplane has got
scrapyard wars parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 then tomorrow
it's gonna get scrapyard Wars part 4
when YouTube gets part 2 and it's also
got and you're in scrapyard Wars yeah so
am i you're in scrapyard worse kinda
you're in scrapyard Wars just talk about
just the voiceover oh you're the
voiceover oh that's nice yes listen oh
that's it is nice I like doing that
listen up keep your ears peeled if you
can peel in here for the this whimsical
voice so also over there we've got the
MSI vortex g25 review we've got the mast
drop vast 35 inch curved gaming monitor
you worked on that one we've got our
video of the let's have a look here what
else have we got over there Oh LG
wallpaper TV part 2 away that's up on
YouTube now Oh
first ever sli setup still isn't on
YouTube so with our voodoo SLI that's
over there right now and I think that
pretty much that pretty much covers it
there's some tech quickies as well all
right what else we got for topics here
oh right if you guys want to know how to
join flow plane you should probably go
check out this link that I'm about to
post in the chat you wanna move on to
our next topic and I guess though sorry
I was just talking to a prime of an
upcoming build guide oh yeah is that the
the value value gaming build guide with
rising the rising 5 best bang for your
buck build bide cool I just want an
extra be in there yeah so I may have
almost screwed up this build guide but
fortunately James had the foresight to
listen to what I was saying and
carefully ignore it beginner's mind
beginners beginners yeah you familiar
with the concept no is it like
beginner's luck but no beginners mine is
when you're like because you don't know
all the minutiae you kind of don't take
things at face value your question stuff
anyway this is actually next topic is
total full circle for us because it's a
kind of part 2 of a topic that you and I
had discussed a couple weeks ago so what
we had discussed was that senator Al
Franken submitted like a letter a bunch
of questions to Apple about their face
ID technology and now Apple has
responded and has answers direct to his
questions one of them I put in bold cuz
you didn't know how the heck Apple did
this and now we get to know so here's
just a bunch of bullet points I don't
want to say Al Franken's questions
because his question will become obvious
when you just hear the answer yeah
answer number one face ID data including
mathematical representations of your
face is encrypted and only available to
the secure Enclave this data never
leaves the device it is not sent to
Apple nor is it included in device
backups cool ah they're just face face
images captured are discarded once the
representation is calculated for
comparison meaning that they can never
surrender it to the authorities though
FBI can't ask for it cuz Apple just
never has it they oh this is cool so I
are in depth images were collected in
the studies conducted with participants
informed consent so we had we had talked
about you know how exactly did they
train the bloody thing because they said
they use billions of images and Linus
was asking well where the heck did they
get these billions of images and it
turns out they actually just took them
themselves it's not they haven't said
that they've taken taken photos of a
billion different people that seems
silly they probably took thousands of
photos of hundreds of people I mean
they're Apple they could conceivably pay
every single person on earth like 60
bucks mm-hmm all right like they could
pay a billion people like 60 bucks to
take a picture of them send us a selfie
yeah so they took multiple pictures with
multiple different types of sensing
technology including IO IO and cool
presumably you have like 360 views there
you go they are taking security for it
pretty darn seriously a next topic
posted by NumLock 21 on the forum this
well boy someone at a soos actually we
know specifically who Andrew woo the ROG
motherboard product manager somewhat at
asu's Andrew woo is in a fair bit of
trouble right now this is some serious
under bus throwing yeah this is some
this is some foot-in-mouth being run
over by the wheel of the bus with the
foot in the mouth so the head gets run
over too and the foot just gets yeah
further in there yeah like it like the
heels up and the wheel it rolls over the
heel and jams it through the back of
this not even gag because there's too
much foot yeah so in an interview with
bit tech bit tech basically well we'll
give you kind of the rundown they
basically go can you explain in
technical detail why coffee lake won't
work with Zee 270 motherboards MPM the
PM goes oh it's it's Intel's decision
bit tech says so it's not a physical
limitation Intel said it was to do with
the power delivery PM goes not really it
power delivery makes a little bit of
difference but not much
so--but tech goes so what are they
referring to that the 20 or so unused
pins from before he goes yes so if you
wanted and Intel let you you could make
z2 70 compatible p.m. goes yes but you
would also require an upgrade from the
management engine a BIOS update until
somehow has locked the compatibility
whoa
okay um it basically just comes down to
stability then and so I'll just did this
for this ability so this is one of those
situations where I run into trouble
because I know things that were told to
me off the record yeah well no yeah I'm
just it's not about that just messing
with you I know things off the record
that they're not they don't conflict
with any of this information because
what he said was that here maybe maybe I
can help the audience infer based on
what he said because all the information
is really in there if you read between
the lines so Intel said it was to do
with the power delivery and he says not
really it makes a little bit of
difference they did change something why
did they do it surely Intel would have
saved themselves some cost and changed
nothing if they didn't feel like they
had to change something for some reason
because if we're going to attack this
problem from the tinfoil hat mindset of
these money-grubbing companies don't
want to spend any money and they want to
take ours
surely we can all agree that Intel would
have done absolutely nothing if there
wasn't some reason that they perceived
that they had to do something so they
did something
it according to this interview had to do
with the power delivery also according
to this interview a soos could make it
compatible if Intel wasn't locking it
out for some reason maybe related to why
they did something it's all in the
interview I haven't said anything that I
wasn't supposed to pass along is there
any possible way that we could like hack
it and make it work no okay
even a soos can't do it because Intel
would have to update
Emme okay second question and you the
BIOS update do you think that Andrew
here kind of backpedal is at the end
where he says you know it's it's not
that big of a deal anyway because people
who bought z2 70 just ten months ago
when it came out they're probably not
likely to be the type of consumer who's
gonna upgrade anyway it's people with
older systems who are gonna upgrade so
to me it really has nothing to do with
that because you know when when KB Lake
came out you know for a long time when
once until launches a new CPU for a long
time sometimes like right through the
entire time it's available you can buy
the last generation chipset which
actually usually has the same features
because they don't change much if they
don't have to you can you can buy those
old ones for a little bit cheaper so if
you wanted a z170 board with a 7700 K
you would get overclocking unlocked for
your K series chip you get just as many
SATA ports you'd get this you get that
and overall performance would in most
cases be very similar in something Carl
and Scott oh no someone set off the
actual alarm is that in 101 or is that
here do you mind investigating thank you
sir the alarms are going off in here uh
yeah so sorry about that guys we get
installed this is a job for laser James
haha they laughed at me they're still
laughing at you that's why I'm yet
thank you that looks like my work here
is done
good work laser James I have known
blockable soil so anyway um from this
interview reading between the lines of
this interview they probably could have
made it compatible there is some reason
related to the power delivery that they
decided not to and not only decided not
to but also decided to do actual work on
Z 370 attack you're an expense
now do I necessarily think then that
this makes Intel some kind of a white
knight no because what they have also
done is they've released only a single
300 series chipset Z 370 the highest
priced one in their stack right so you
don't even have the option to buy you
know like an 80 400 for example and pair
it with a cheapo board because because
it doesn't it's not unlocked for
overclocking anyway so yeah that's
pretty greasy so are they clearly trying
to extract more value from the customer
yeah if they felt bad about it they
would have done like the bare minimum
like just like almost that cost okay
like eating it see if they had no margin
on them on the mobos then alright so
there they're clearly trying to you know
you know do corporate things you know
rise you know average cart price or
whatever those metrics that eat Ahlers
look for drive attached you know that
kind of stuff they're clearly doing that
but I'm also not necessarily one of the
people holding a torch going you should
be able to plug a coffee lake into a Z
270 because there does appear to be an
actual physical change that they made
that they felt was necessary for the
most stable and optimal operation
honestly I think one of the big reasons
that we only got Z three 70s until was
fully aware that coffee like supply was
going to be extraordinarily limited and
they figured well if people like if we
can't keep them on shelves anyway then
we might as well sell them to the people
that we're gonna go out
and spend the most on the best chipset
and the top-of-the-line that's not what
he's saying Sentra
he's saying that people are just ready
to upgrade who didn't upgrade to z2 70
can upgrade now but they're gonna have
to do that's a great expense yeah I mean
that's that's that's his whole thing and
I'm not I'm making my I'm drawing my own
conclusions here about what exactly
Intel was doing with their strategy so
I'll leave it to you guys to sort of
come up with your own your own answers
here but I do want to show you your own
answer something we discussed there yeah
let's go ahead and pull up our
microtransactions poll from earlier in
the show $50 game how much is it
acceptable to spend per year on micro
transaction so first I Alex how much per
year is it acceptable to spend nothing
okay so you are actually the second most
popular answer 38% of our voters think
it's okay to spend up to $10 on a $50
game so like a little treat it's a
little something for yourself horse
armor you know yeah sorry you'd do that
in a $30 $30 Canadian that's like that's
like signals is that okay
31% of you are saying zero dollars
period 22% of you 50 bucks and 10% of
you must be like some kind of mega
ballers because you think it's okay to
spend between 50 to over $100 on
microtransactions you get are you for
real I can't even imagine spending that
kind of money on microtransaction MLG
baby you know hardcore yeah that much is
how much I mean I didn't even spend that
much of my car look at my car it's not
even worth $100 seriously I took it down
tried to trade it in new straw pool new
straw poll how much would you pay for
alliances car I bet I bet you could get
more than a hundred bucks I am yeah okay
those so that's okay that's a bit of
there's an issue with that though you're
taking all those phones what's that one
on the bottom
oh the pixel Oh okay so hey guys this is
another cool teaser so those of you who
aren't subscribed over on floatplane
won't actually know this yet but brandon
here is going to be working on a first
for our channel a smartphone camera
roundup but why are you what why are you
doing this this is this is how i'm going
to be on the show now you're behind the
mic yeah good stay there stay there
because those are those are so
ridiculous so anyway um I've never
really done in-depth phone camera
testing because frankly I mean you're
not a camera person I'm not qualified
Thank You Brandon so so with the pixel 2
and the iPhone 8 and to a lesser extent
the essay but definitely the node 8 the
camera was like the thing they wanted to
talk about so Brandon's gonna be doing a
dedicated video sometime probably next
week on floatplane hopefully maybe the
following week really picking these
films apart and figuring out which one
is more camera for your dollar attached
to a phone and you're throwing a DSLR
into the mix aren't you yes oh boy well
we'll see many many is that almost a
separate video I don't know the whole
like should you still buy you know a
$600 $700 DSLR you want to talk about it
maybe we should just bring you on for
like a win show segment or something I
don't know you know my favorite part
about this whole thing is Brandon hates
smartphone camera commentary he hates
when people talk about it he hates when
this video is about the iPhone camera he
hates it now he has to do it to clarify
I do not hate the iPhone and smartphone
cameras being good I do however hate the
thousands of articles I have seen over
the years about things that are shot on
the iPhone being making it seem like the
iPhone was the best tool for I get I get
it it's good enough
for this use case and it can work
perfect all riled up but there is no one
who can sit there and tell me that the
iPhone is a better camera in most use
cases for a professional situation
Brandon just your pills I can tell you
that I won't have any credibility but I
can do that
just just to get his blood pressure up
no he's not even gonna make it into work
on Monday he'll have had like four heart
attacks also I just realized why aren't
we calling the pixel XL the pixel the
pick sickle the time I sold Cole the
pixel double XL alright so thanks for
