exciting day I have been waiting and no
exaggeration over a year for this moment
hold on I just got to pull this into our
epic like shade thing okay there we go
all right let's go ahead and put this
bad boy down now I first laid eyes on
this at Computex 2017 so I think that
was somewhere in the neighborhood of
about I don't know a year and a quarter
ago I'm almost two years ago now and it
was one of those things where I I walked
up to the the rep and the booth and I
was like yo I want that thing and they
were like what is even wrong with you
like what what hey why would you even
want it and be why the hell would I give
it to you that's ridiculous
do you have any idea how big it is do
you have any idea how much these things
cost and I was like yo I'm gonna have
that and this is this is one I'm like
this is one of my favorite reps okay his
name's cliff he's a good guy good guy he
was like I'll try but like it's not
gonna happen and I was like okay fine
whatever so he tried and long story
short it actually it didn't happen you
know that the approval process just
pretty all right they're gonna you know
break some break some crate here the
approval process didn't go through and I
was like ah you know that sucks but
you know you win some you lose some
what's up I know there's screws on the
side dingleberry I'm stalling for time I
got a got an electric drill right here
smart guy with the right bit and I know
there's screws on the sides that is
super tight or something
thanks guys I'm not an idiot
well okay let's be really careful with
like these you know be-all and end-all
black and white statements I'm not an
idiot might be an idiot but I know I
know how to disassemble a crate
well I didn't want to break the crate
but like I was prying the thing and it
just kept on okay fine I'll do it I'll
do it properly
anyway anyway so it didn't go through
and I was I was pretty disappointed
sounds like this thing is pretty cool
then you know yeah I'm gonna finish the
story of how we actually got it later on
in the stream because first I think
we've gotta get this puppy opened up so
that we can you can deal with some of
the suspense that I'm sure you guys are
all feeling about what is in here so to
be clear this wasn't free we didn't
actually pay the brands for the item but
it actually cost me I think this is
probably the most that I have ever spent
on a purely decorative anything because
what's in this box has no purpose all it
is is like cool and I really wanted it
and then by the time I found out how
much it was gonna cost me in shipping to
get it here I was kind of like committed
and it was sort of like you know I had
to do it for the means at that point but
this cost somewhere in the neighborhood
of seven to nine hundred dollars or
something like that do you member how
much this thing cost to ship you don't
know yeah so it cost like seven nine
hundred bucks something stupid like that
just to ship it here because the
contents of this crate are hailing from
the beautiful islands nation
of Taiwan oh yeah I guess we can't we
can't upload this stream in China at
this point then yeah excuse me the
beautiful island of of China Chinese
Taipei whatever Taiwan number one okay
so uh I think this is basically all I
have to do to roll this thing out I
think no no don't stand there Brandon
I'm what just happened to my bit
retracted bit syndrome RBS it's a
serious serious disease
don't laugh Jake okay so I think what's
gonna happen here is this is just gonna
fall down okay that is not what's going
to happen so we are going to have to
continue to investigate the construction
of this crate actually Brendan here you
come around this side this side this
side should be safe so if you want to
give people let people kind of guess
Jake let me know what kind of guesses
you see for what's in here you can kind
of try and have a look at it from the
side there but I think I need to I think
I need to hop up here oh boy ah okay so
I think there's another six screws I got
to get that up here and I realize I'm
not in your carefully laid out shade
thing anymore Brandon but I don't really
think there's anything I can do about it
oh this is kind of not on even ground
which I guess it's fine Oh see this is
why we fast-forward this kind of thing
when we edit the videos oh okay ah yeah
hold on
I'm good I'm good what are you calling
me fat dick Oh
oh I'm sure some of them do but they
might be wrong we've got someone thinks
it's a giant Pikachu that would actually
be pretty sick no it's not a dog give me
give me some more give me some more
guesses here an old IBM server I wish
that would be pretty sick okay I think
I'm about to kick this open Brandon you
ready here comes the moment Wow okay
that was supporting a lot of the top
okay
Jake can I borrow you off the monitoring
station there for a minute there and
just grab that there drill there but all
the other but thanks there but okay okay
yeah should be fine okay thank you
oh boy all right what's holding it now
oh so this kind of crate I guess is like
you know well engineered crate that has
support braces in here check this out so
I actually have to remove these before I
can get you've got to be kidding me
okay that was almost in there in such a
way that I couldn't get at it and then I
got to do these ones because they've
actually got support braces running all
four ways here really like freaking
really oh this oh there's like nine more
okay I wish I had done the bottom ones
first come on
hold on you got to speak up I can't hear
you Jake
but what Gaelic or Dalek Doctor Who Oh a
Dalek no it is not a Dalek that would be
pretty sick to go mainframe nope no
mainframe chat blowing up giant though a
tunnel Bert no no tunnel there ha ha ha
ha yeah oh what a cooler for thread
Ripper 3 no no I think you're thinking
of Intel's upcoming 28 core ok let's try
this one more time
ha well that was the desired effect
right boom that's what I've been waiting
for that dramatic crate fall oh man so
just I mean I'm a bit of a homunculus
and all that but this should still give
you some idea of how friggin big this
thing is like this is this is no joke
some cool stuff in here and it is holy
crap is it ever heavy so these are the
support braces I was talking about we've
got to going across this way and then to
going across this way and I guess the
idea is to keep this from shifting
around and shipping I really hope that
in spite of their best efforts it wasn't
damaged in shipping because that would
be extraordinarily disappointing right
now alright is there any point in me
trying to keep track of all these screws
is that just a losing battle I mean
realistically I'm not sending it back so
there ya go there you guys how you do it
it's a shame it's made out of like
shoddy wood cuz that seems like it broke
off pretty easily
I bet we can just do the rest of them
like that oh wow look at this just came
apart like that
Taiwanese wood okay good electronics bad
wood like here let's go get a close-up
of this one when I rip it off from
through the slats through the slats
there check that out
like I'm not even gonna put a lot of
force on it it's like okay well that one
actually held up reasonably but still no
so I stand by it
ha where's uh okay we're gonna go for
see if we can kick this one off I think
this thing can support me at this point
right nope I mean yes it can but ah come
on let's try the other side
you know what I don't even need to
remove that one okay ah let's get this
out of the way I can't wait to tell you
guys the story of how I finally got this
thing I'll tell you one spoiler though
my razor rep is either gonna laugh or be
so pissed off that he's not gonna talk
to me for like at least a quarter
Manship I should probably take those
ones out too man this is a lot of
packaging Harambee no rip harambe but
this is not not a stuffed Harambee
unfortunately or fortunately depending
on how you look at that Jesus I'm sure
someone's keeping track because don't
take this the wrong way but like our
audience is nerdy like that how many
screws have I taken out at this point
it's ridiculous it's ridiculous
screwing competition actually I mean if
we're being honest I'm secure enough to
just say that all right there we go huh
you know there can be a lot of reasons
why you know your wife decides to settle
with you and I'm just saying you know
for some of us it's some things and for
some of us it's that Wow does that just
start sliding holy crap I don't think so
oh yes it is on wheels
okay I mean I guess that kind of makes
sense cuz it's like really big and heavy
and stuff but how do I get it down now
justjust yellow it boy it's it's
reasonably heavy part of the problem
though is cuz it's still in the
packaging I don't know if what I'm
holding on to is fragile no oh okay uh
it's just I have a knife over there cuz
I kind of feel like I'm gonna need one
come on look okay I think we're gonna
get these wheels blocked here alright we
just kind of I don't know oh they have
brakes
they got brakes their brakes are hard to
press come on go we'll break yes okay oh
I'm so excited
I haven't even actually seen this thing
since over a year ago when I first like
kind of impulsively they Alex used the
word impulsive impulsively decided that
I wanted it it might not even be that
cool like I might just have kind of
built it up in my mind over the last
little while here all right well well
Jake works on finding a knife here
you're gonna start dealing as much of
the plastic
as I can I still can't even believe that
they sent this it was so ridiculous Oh
totally unreasonable thing to ask for
and like no one no one thinks this is a
good idea like my wife is super
irritated brandon is super not impressed
Jake thinks it's a cool idea right
yeah okay well Jake's with me their
magic Jake's kind of a two-hole son so
kind of shows what company I keep on
this particular one JK Jake 31,000
people are watching this Wow
oh yeah yeah dog I mean if you're if
you're supporting this endeavor here
yeah okay you know what why don't you be
helpful in the way that's a little more
helpful maybe huh what do you think it's
like many hands makes sometimes very
inefficient work okay
should we let people take a couple more
guesses before we all right secrets out
here it comes
should I go to bottom to top or top to
bottom what's the right way to undress
it just take it off I don't even know if
it's like facing forward or anything oh
man there's like a whole other there's a
whole other layer oh wait no I thought
that was another layer there it is baby
I got my very own lucky the dragon yes
Taiwan number one
oh man right let me cut this so Jake
asks where on earth are we gonna put
this and that is that is the reason that
lots of other people are sort of mad
about me getting this not even because I
wasted a lot of money but also because
it has the potential to take oh oh man
you know what you know what though for
the memes if it's for nothing but the
means I'm still so glad I did it I do so
few like just stupid for the memes
things that I figure you can kind of let
me have this one right so okay wow it's
still in perfect condition so the
initial response to me was like - yo do
you have any idea how much it costs to
create these kinds of like one-off
promotional pieces because this cut this
is not mass-produced like I think they
have only one of them and like it's it's
hand-painted if you're looking like
clothes here I have no idea how they do
the molding for something this big but
it is it's not a non complex thing to
both design and manufacture they did
absolutely a fantastic job of it whoever
built this for MSI and I was like yeah I
know but then I was like well I mean
like come on realistically what are you
guys gonna do with it it's huge like you
can't you can't store it all the time
like you can't just take it to every
show cuz it's super expensive to ship
realistically like what do you guys even
what do you guys even need it for you
should just send it to me and they're
like well will you put
in your studio I'm like oh god you know
like maybe like I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna like just have it in all of our
videos like Oh Linus tech tips brought
to you by MSI I got myself all over that
that MSI or anything like that but like
yeah I don't probably show up once in a
while because it's like it's sick look
at this guy but um so the way that I
finally convinced them was actually
about a year later
oh hey Vaughn can I borrow you for a sec
I was just telling everyone on the
stream that you were you were really
impressed with my decision to purchase
this how much how much was it again do
you remember how much the shipping was
something like that okay okay ladies and
gentlemen out there you got a you got a
pick a side here okay Linus with the
dragon or Yvonne who thinks it's a
dinosaur and therefore clearly doesn't
understand the value here okay some key
differences between dragons and
dinosaurs my dear okay for one thing
dragons are real how do we know because
we can see it dinosaurs the fossil
record that's a scam that's how they get
you paleontologists that is that is like
that is a crazy racket okay difference
number one different - excuse me
I lost track there's so many differences
that I could talk forever difference
number two dragons have wings dinosaurs
don't count nope nope and also remember
those are fake fake dinosaurs reason
number three dinosaurs are not red and
Dragons are well they could have been
but there's no way of knowing and also
they were fake so thank you thank you
very much I think I think the audience
has probably made their decision now
what what do you guys think get get get
out of here right
look at this obviously this is Mario
right okay I don't know what the
mushroom is all about but yeah okay so
right this is the part in the stream
where finally I reveal what happened do
you know the story okay oh yeah that was
yeah okay so you know what stick around
stick around yeah you can correct me if
I get anything wrong so guys it's been a
year since I've even seen this thing at
their booth the previous year and I go
up and we go through their booth and I'm
like yo man all this stuff's pretty
boring I don't know if we're even like
making a video here this year and then
you know after after a while he shows us
like all the new products I'm like yeah
these are like basically just slightly
tuned refreshes of what you had last
time it's been kind of a slow Computex
well I think we're just gonna focus on
walking around in the rain and whining
about Intel and what they're doing no no
that was the year before you know it
doesn't it doesn't matter yeah it's hard
to keep track because it like you
spanned an entire year last ten years
has just been one long year for Linus
yeah leading up to this moment
so anyway finally we find like the cool
thing that MSI was doing with their
laptops where they're bundling that that
Android emulator but they're kind of
like the rebranding it they're adding a
little bit of functionality and they're
like including it with their laptop so
you can play on droid games on their
laptops I go this is pretty this is
pretty cool actually but the issue here
is I don't know what to title it and so
we were like spitballing titles in the
booth I think it was you me and Anthony
right no we were spitballing titles in
the booth and I forget who said it but
one of us blurted out like we should
call it Razer wishes they thought of
this uh-uh
and anyway so cliff who I'm not going to
name by name in the video here cuz I
don't want like his phone to blow up
after this video goes up so so he's like
come on you gotta call it that I'm like
oh man I I don't know it's pretty like
it's pretty click Beatty he's like yeah
whatever you click bait all the time
anyway I'm like you know what screw you
cliff I use stronger words though screw
you cliff tell you what if I call the
video that you got to get me that dragon
this is no this is the dragon and he
goes oh man
cuz I've been chasing him about this for
like the last year right he goes oh I
told you I told you they don't want to
give you the dragon cuz they're worried
that you're gonna like say or like do
something inappropriate or you're not
gonna treat it properly you're like man
that's like that's our brand and I'm
like yeah but that's my dragon that your
brand is on so I'm gonna need that
dragon the ball I don't know I don't
know where the ball went but uh anyway
so he's like okay look give me a give me
a few minutes he goes away
and then he he comes back he's like okay
I'll get you the dragon but you got to
pay for shipping oh my god yeah man I
told you I pay for shipping I told you
I'd buy it I don't even care you gotta
pay for shipping this is friggin awesome
so anyway it took another what is it is
it October now so it took another almost
four my June July August September
October it took over four more months
but here it is
I still have absolutely no idea where to
put it it's so wide it's not even gonna
fit through like a person door like it
has to go in through a Bay we're gonna
have to like clear a path like Tyler is
probably even more mad at me than Ivonne
because he's the one who has to like you
know dude shipping receiving for this
crate and have it taking up quite
literally all of his receiving area
space for the last couple of weeks here
but uh you know what I pissed off a lot
of people and I didn't really get
anything sort of meaningful in return
other than self-satisfaction and maybe
that makes me kind of an asshole but I'm
a happy asshole right now happy asshole
so with with a dragon
dragon asshole it's my dragon energy
right here so thanks for watching guys
if you just like this because you could
hit that button I wouldn't blame you but
