head and I have my hand on the mouse but
that's entirely unnecessary
um now something that I've always
wondered about is those crazy guys who
wear tinfoil hats and the claim has
always been to me that that will block
the government satellites from reading
your mind so I designed an experiment to
test once and for all
whether a tinfoil hat can truly block
out the government's brain reading
brainwave reading satellites this is the
tinfoil hat that I will be wearing now
bearing in mind this is aluminum foil
because pretty tough to get tin foil
these days all right and then I will be
using vania's mind wave reading ability
to test my hypothesis that an aluminum
foil hat will prevent the government
from reading your thoughts so what we're
going to do for this experiment is we
are first going to install the NIA and
then run the biometric scan that is part
of the setup wizard for the NIA so here
we go remember this is the NIA plus not
the not the regular Nia that's available
in the market right now okay so it is
now officially installed and we're going
to rerun our scan here is the aluminum
position between the Nia and my head
okay we got to move the Nia up a little
bit that's fine that's fine I can dig it
okay how are we doing for installation
now we good we're good okay so here we
go now we find out once and for all
whether those guys are crazy or not
scan in progress the skin was successful
however ha the truth as usual lies
somewhere between the tinfoil hat
blocking the mind waves and the tinfoil
hat not blocking it so maybe they're not
so crazy after all there seems to be
some truth to this you see the scan was
successful and we are getting little
jumps of brain activity here ok
but we're not getting nearly the same
level of activity that we would get
without the tinfoil hat installed so I'm
going to go ahead and remove the tinfoil
hat okay so here's my tinfoil hat
Exhibit A and we are going to reinstall
the NIA with no tinfoil hat and observe
the difference in the relaxation range
here we go scan in progress so now you
see my relaxation is much lower because
I was not able to successfully block ocz
or the government or whoever's trying to
read my brainwaves from reading them so
thank you for checking out this NCIX
tech tips on brainwaves and whether or
not the government can monitor them</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
