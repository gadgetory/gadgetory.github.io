the latest triple-a games at high frame
rates or if you need the extra muscle
for video editing 3d rendering or
computer assisted design but if we're
being honest for most people a thin and
light basic laptop is more than enough
these days and comes with the extra
benefits of portability and convenience
that you simply don't get with a desktop
the real bummer is when you end up
having to buy both a desktop for your
gaming or your heavy work and a laptop
for when you're out in a boat
I mean why bother having two full CPUs
installed on two motherboards when you
can only really use one at a time
if only there is a solution
we're just by plugging one cable into
that laptop you already own you could
extend it with a full-sized desktop all
the peripherals and expansion you could
want and even a powerful graphics card
and I mean while I'm dreaming
what if wireless charging was simply
built right into a desk oh wait it is
and we did hold that stuff and we're
gonna show you exactly how it works
after this message from our sponsor
origin origin PC builds custom desktops
like this one over here that we were
actually using for a video earlier and
laptops with free 24/7 lifetime tech
support and high quality components like
samsung's 970 evo m2 SSD check them out
at the link in the video description
so step zero for making your very own
one cable desk doc thing is having a
compatible laptop you don't get dual 4k
monitors 10 gig file transfers and 85
watts of charging through a regular old
micro USB port and cable no for this to
work you need a laptop with at least one
Thunderbolt 3 port and we would strongly
recommend finding one that has a four by
PCI Express Lane interface so
Thunderbolt 3 looks like a normal USB
type-c port except for this little
lightning bolt emblem that isn't even
always there so the Thunderbolt 3 port
on our 2018 razor blade stealth for
example is totally unmarked if you need
to double check your device you can
always search for it on the Thunderbolt
technology website now for step 1 plan
your layout
at a minimum your desk talk is going to
need a Thunderbolt 3 hub for everything
to run through luckily for us Cal digit
was kind enough to send us their
flagship PS 3 plus which can provide 85
watts of power that's enough to charge a
MacBook Pro and it's got enough ports
for your peripherals wired internet and
a 10 gigabit external drive o also up to
2 4k monitors now you could just get a
device like this and call it a day
with no other parts necessary but to
make our setup really special we wanted
to add an external graphics card
enclosure so that our desktop not only
makes our laptop easier to use with a
monitor and peripherals and you know
lots of ports and all that but also
substantially more powerful so that
ended up making things a bit more
complicated for starters
while Thunderbolt 3 does support daisy
chaining up to six devices off of a
single port you can't just plug your
graphics card into your dock unless
you're a GPU is the first device in the
chain you'll get awful latency at best
and at worst random crashes or total non
functionality
okay so we just switched the order then
right laptop to eg PU eg PU tada Oh
so at the time of writing the odds of
your eg PU having two ports on it for
daisy-chaining
are pretty low the only options we're
aware of are the Blackmagic II GPU which
only works with Max the acquittee oh no
duo which is designed to hold two cards
but at only half the bandwidth each and
the Acadia node Pro which is exactly
what we ended up using it solves our
problems but it has a gotcha even though
our ts3 + hub can deliver 85 watts of
power your laptop only receives power
from the device that it is directly
connected to so in our case that's the
node pro whose Thunderbolt 3 ports can
only deliver up to 60 watts of power so
machines with higher power demands like
the MacBook Pro could end up trickle
charging fortunately for us that is not
the case for my blade stealth 20:17 so
our journey continues step 2 then choose
a suitable desk as you can see our
finished desk dock is completely stealth
meaning that even though it's got
integrated wireless charging and a
freaking graphics card you can't see
either of those things when you're
sitting at the desk and that is only
possible because of the planning that we
did back in step 1
so we limited our options to ones with
enough cabinet space and thickness to
contain all of our devices and our
cables with obvious cable management
runs for bonus points this one fit the
bill nicely and we're mostly thrilled
with how the finished product looks but
we're gonna stop short of a
recommendation here because the desks
build quality is a bit of a
disappointment it's basically IKEA level
it even uses the same dowels and
hardware but it was at least twice what
you'd expect to pay at the
blue-and-yellow store and it is full of
little oversights like these holes here
that aren't even big enough to
accommodate the screws that are included
with the desk now it's time for power
tools
three is to hide the e GPU inside the
desk somehow our desk arrived before our
EGP you did but the on paper specs
indicated that it was just a bit smaller
than the cabinet that is as long as the
drawers weren't in the way so we made
room by shortening the drawers this
created an empty space at the back of
the cabinet while maintaining the
original look and what's really cool is
that these drawers can still be used to
hold a couple of pens or like a single
banana when it actually arrived though
we did find out that once you accounted
for cables and drawer rails there really
wasn't enough room for the giant EG pu
chassis fortunately we were able to
extract the parts that matter and then
prop them up on a Genki frame made out
of scrap wood that did fit inside the
hollowed cabinet one more thing we
learned from our last desk project that
cooling is super important so we used a
hole saw to bore a four fan breezeway
then used fan splitters to connect our
fans to the single fan header that was
already on the node pros PCB step three
was installing an invisible wireless
charger now the original plan here was
to simply cut a charging pad sized hole
in the top of the desk and then have the
exposed pad kind of poking through but
then we remembered hey we have a giant
CNC router and an alux so he programmed
a basic design including a cable channel
and after a couple of test cuts to make
sure that this low-quality chipboard
didn't just explode on contact with the
blade we were able to carve out a recess
for the charging pad to nest into from
the bottom leaving the surface of the
desk intact but as thin as possible to
maximize the charging pads effectiveness
then we added these classy dots to show
you where the heck thing is cool right
step four was mounting the Thunderbolt
three hub so the ts3 plus has i/o on the
front that we wanted to be able to
access so we used velcro tape on the top
to mount it to the underside of the desk
this gives us both a discreet slick
looking finish and the ability to pull
the device off easily
instead of contorting our spines in the
that we need to plug something into the
back step 5 cable management our desk
did come with cable management holes in
the middle but we added a few more of
our own so that we could route all of
the cables from the inside of the desk
and the cabinet as one low key umbilical
cord behind the table leg
once you're done then the only loose
cable that you should ever have to
interact with is the Thunderbolt 3 cable
that you plug into your machine and this
is cool it can actually go on either
side of this divider down here thanks to
the hole that we drilled at the back
that means that it doesn't matter which
side of your device your Thunderbolt 3
port is on so that's how we did it but
let me show you guys how it works so
first I have to configure my laptop to
not go to sleep when I close the lid now
obviously I could have set up the desk
so that the laptop goes here and then it
just stays open and I could use it as a
second monitor or whatever else but we
were going for the cleanest setup so
once it's powered I can go ahead and
close the lid and it's not going to go
to sleep you can just kind of tuck it in
there now we give it like somewhere
between 5 and 10 seconds and our monitor
should come to life
our peripherals should come on baby
start working there we go and check this
out if I hop over to device manager we
might even be able to catch it showing
up here no it's already there GeForce
GTX 1080 Ti so because this is a quad
core ultrabook that means that we are
actually in a position where we can play
triple-a level games on our ultra book
just with this one cable so I'm gonna go
ahead and fire up rise at the Tomb
Raider one other really cool thing that
I don't actually have set up here is
that with some of the other high-speed
USB ports on the back of this Cal digit
device you could also do something like
have a high speed either SSD or hard
drive that you've got pre attached and
then just like I don't know taped to the
top or even just hanging out back there
like plugged into something like this
and then what would happen is even if
you didn't have a ton of storage on your
laptop you could plug it in
and boom your steam library with you
know hundreds of gigabytes of games
would automatically be remapped and then
accessible to you that's something that
actually already works fairly well so
let's go ahead and continue our getting
here so this is rise of the Tomb Raider
running at mostly high I've got motion
blur disabled and a couple of other
things that I just kind of prefer but
this is that mostly high details running
at 75 70 to 75 frames per second and the
coolest thing about it is actually
something that probably won't be obvious
to you guys watching right now and
that's this so my microphones right here
it's basically silent so for peace of
mind next time around I'd probably put
an 80 millimeter fan in the back and
just have it draw some air across the
laptop but honestly we left it running
for over an hour yesterday in a game and
our CPU never hit about 65 degrees so it
was chilly in our warehouse but
basically at room temperature you'd
never see above about 75 and then our
GPU stayed downright frosty with all
those cooling fans circulating air in
the cabinet honestly the loudest fan in
this thing is the one in the included
power supply from the Akio node Pro so
to do it again I'd do the cooling fan
and then probably swap out that power
supply silverstone has some really great
options for semi silent units they've
got like an 800 watt that I think the
fan only turns on if you draw over like
2 or 300 watts of power so something
like that would make this whole setup
not just stealthy to the eye but also
still think to the ear all right so now
because we kind of have to let's fire up
fortnight and have a look at what it
thinks will be the ideal settings for
our system here 50% off what do I have
to pay for that you got to be kidding me
what is this
so it has defaulted us to our I don't
know why there's a framerate limit you
know what I'm just gonna do this myself
motion blur off No
I want that alright not bad so we're
running in the neighborhood of 70 to 80
FPS I've seen dips down to 55 or 60
let's go ahead and jump out of the
battle bus here yep so around 50 at the
lowest as we're falling so I could
probably improve that by dropping a
couple things down to medium but overall
very playable and remember this is at 38
40 by 1600 resolution running off of a
laptop CPU super-impressed
good I mean I could take his plane right
yeah bye loser I'm definitely getting a
little bit of chop that I wouldn't be
expecting I think there's a little bit
more tuning required to get this running
as smoothly as I would expect for the
FPS that we're getting we got to get out
of here we gotta get out of here oh damn
so maybe a couple more things to tweak
here now that I've seen this fall down
once some kind of reinforcements so it
stays in place better probably a good
idea also using a mouse directly on a
desk surface is not something I'd
recommend if we had thought for certain
that there was no way we were gonna
damage the table what we would have
really wanted to do was route out
exactly the shape of a mousepad and then
have it recessed in the table that's
something we'd probably want to do on a
v2 but I mean other than that I'm super
proud of the result here I gave James
the task of creating the cleanest set up
Bar None and as far as I'm concerned
mission accomplished I think the only
thing left now is maybe to do like an
updated version for our you know MacBook
user viewers with maybe a couple of the
tweaks that we've talked about but we'll
see let us know in the comments if you'd
like to see a follow up and now I want
to thank our sponsor for today's video
mass drop they collaborated with costs
to bring their original 1984 design and
update it to make it modern and durable
while remaining light so these are
portable on-ear headphones that can be
folded up in different configurations
from compact for easy storage they use
they use oxygen free copper voice coils
for great audio and a warm smooth
experience and the single button control
lets you skip tracks make calls and
activate voice commands through the
noise cancelling mic it's backed by
causas lifetime warranty and you can
join the drop today and grab yourself a
pair of these for thirty seven

thanks for watching guys if you dislike
this video you can hit that button but
if you liked it hit like get subscribed
or maybe consider checking out where to
buy the stuff we featured at the link in
the video description also down there is
our merch store which has cool shirts
like the one I'm wearing and our
community forum which you should totally
join and yes the animation smoothness is
way better as soon as I dropped the
render resolution down a little bit I
think it was just struggling a bit at
basically 4k</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
