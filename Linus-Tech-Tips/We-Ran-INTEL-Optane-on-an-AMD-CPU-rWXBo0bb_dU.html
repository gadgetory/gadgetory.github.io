of their tiny capacity these things do a
great job of accelerating anything from
boot hard drive to even something like a
steam game drive only one small problem
Intel only officially supports octane on
its own platforms and even then only the
latest ones but did you know that AMD
has a competing solution called store mi
store mi aims to do the same thing as
obtain caching but with the added
flexibility of using any SSD you want
like this one or this one or this one
so naturally we wondered what happens
when you try and run intel design opting
memory modules in a competing platform
origin pcs evil 15s weighs only 4.3
pounds and features a smooth 144 Hertz
1080p display along with an NVIDIA GTX
1070 max Q graphics card check out their
latest deals by clicking the link below
as usual Intel's and AMD's approaches to
the problem of tiered storage have a lot
in common
so both take the hassle of managing to
separate drive letters smaller C Drive
that's faster for your OS and your key
programs and then a big drive for your
games and media files so basically
you're combining these two physical
devices into one virtual one that
intelligently moves the most frequently
accessed data to the faster of your
drives this technology is called tearing
and it has a long history in enterprise
storage but there are also some key
differences since AMD's motherboard
division doesn't have an SSD business
unit breathing down their necks to sell
more more caching modules store EMI can
be used with any SSD TM as long as this
either less than 256 gigs or you
artificially limit it to 256 gigs and as
long as you have an X 470 motherboard
presumably so AMD can absorb the
licensing cost of the third-party fused
drive software AMD is a smaller software
development team would be another key
difference but honestly that's okay for
us anyway since we're going to be using
the same octane memory module for both
platforms and this thing is only 32 gigs
well within the limit since a my setup
is pretty straightforward you pick two
drives that's the maximum in the
included version you assign one to the
fast tier and the other to slow and then
the program goes in does its thing so
we'll be using the exact same method as
we did for obtain testing in order to
evaluate it launch six games one after
the other time the load times
reboot
and repeat what just happened
okay so the first run was slower than
loading from just a hard drive but
that's normal
while the caching software learns but
then the performance on the next run not
only didn't improve it actually got
worse except then when sometimes it
didn't it honestly analyzing these
numbers was like doing post-mortem on
like what the dog had for breakfast
they're scattered all over the place
with in some cases no discernable
pattern whatsoever I mean then to make
matters worse at some point you play
kicked us out for game assets violation
and when we ran steams integrity checker
tons of the files were missing what
happened okay it's possible we dropped
the hard drive who knows things happen
around here
so we've grabbed another one and then
believer in but things got even weirder
even after unti hring the drive before
moving it to the other system it was not
visible to the other machine other than
in the UEFI BIOS Windows couldn't see it
at all the only way for it to detect was
by brute forcing a form out of the drive
using Paragon then while investigating
we hooked up a second drive back to the
AMD test bench cheered then uncheered it
dropped a couple files onto it move that
to the second machine only to have it
also not detect then we had to brute
force format that to make it accessible
again and then we dumped this team
folder onto it and upon hooking it up to
the first machine we were greeted with
like a ghost of the old Drive contents
and then this unexpected error
preventing us from accessing it okay so
TLDR if story my touches your drive you
cannot access it on another machine
without a full format now in phase
to AMD there is a one-liner warning when
you're tearing the drives up but it's
still pretty frustrating with that
behind us though we rebuilt a new tiered
Drive and got to benching again and same
thing numbers all over the place and
frenetic hard drive activity to get a
tick but then other reviewers were
getting sense and I to work so what's
the pattern here
well other reviewers tested launch times
back-to-back as in run one app reboot
observe scaling so could that be it
actually yes so when we used the same
approach we finally got our octane
module to work with store mi but then
even then it took three or four runs to
see the improvement and the results were
nowhere near what we expected so then we
got to thinking maybe store mi uses a
more rudimentary caching algorithm that
simply runs out of space on such a small
caching drive that might explain the
hard drive thrashing popping a Samsung
960 pro into the machine confirmed the
theory performance improved 2 SSD grade
by the both the second run and then even
further on the third and was right up
there with our Intel platform + octane
so we were satisfied store my grade
product actually no we were only
temporarily satisfied because the
untiring process took over an hour with
a 12 terabyte drive and a 256 SSD so
store my works but it comes with a lot
of limitations unless you shall out
extra money making it far from ideal
and then Intel's own solution is
relatively locked down so now what is
there a better way
perhaps we scoured the LTTE forum which
you should totally
nuts and found out about primo caps it
comes with a 60-day trial so we gave it
a shot and oh my god first of all its
flexibility its head and shoulders above
the other two so you can configure
control and monitor multiple arrays you
can actually mix partitions from
different drives within the same array
you can set detailed options for each of
your configurations and you can even add
drives to be cashed into existing arrays
and furthermore it can even use part of
your system memory as a super fast extra
cash and it provides monitoring of key
stats like cache hits and usage
second of all it's non-destructive that
means that what primo cache seems to be
doing is copying files to the cache
rather than moving them that means that
uncashed
is a matter of a few clicks and a few
seconds of waiting since you don't have
to sit there while the files recopy from
your fast storage back onto your
freaking slow storage and then finally
there's the performance not only did it
manage to be on par with the other two
solutions it also made an octane cache
on AMD sing the song that store mi
couldn't unfortunately taking our
best-case scenario on primo cache and
topping it up with eight gigs of our
system ram that we had to spare didn't
make a noticeable difference to our
testing but we're still really impressed
so there you have it all three solutions
can achieve similar performance so
obtain works really well with platform
lockdown limitations Stora my works well
with some headaches
not to mention platform lockdown
limitations or that cheddar and primo
cache works on everything with
everything with no side effects that we
observed but does cost $30 for a license
after the first 60 days
but that said you could just buy a
cheaper board instead of an X 470 and
then just spend that 30 bucks on a
license yeah why not do that

this one and our community forum which I
would say occasionally but it happens
more often than you'd think
teaches us as much as we teach them
