our criminal group our cabal or that's
called
sire to your incriminated but we
appreciate you risking everything to go
and get us another drive you did get one
that was still IDE we so appreciate that
toe somehow it still had the same issue
and we had three drives that didn't work
and so so I guess all's had to say for
any of you at home we did what we did
because we had no other choice I was
able to delete the the volume and then I
just told it to do a quick format mid
format suddenly just disappeared it's
like the format failed just be gone I
think it might be the adapter it is yeah
an old adapter
whoa the drive edge will stole isn't
working so pollen counts and dead will
to get them another Drive but this time
they get caught
Red Hat what's this what's going on are
you stealing hard drives for them it is
stealing hard drives for them
what what is this ed ed what are you
crazy
what do you got what you got going on
over there yeah I don't really know how
it all turned around but basically we
just figured well we want to put
something out there we want to get a
system that we can compete with so if
what we have to do is resort to a bit of
skullduggery then that's what we'll do
looks like these quality thing to wear
but if they're going to use this
external hard drive from polished
personal stash they're gonna have to
cover the track right there if I'll
never know heated at the back you think
eating your tagging up lady cheating
that yeah I can feel the back of the
site go on and I'm gonna bend that one
of these and that I can fish is
participating maybe I can just set it in
the bottom there you go is there any
other
I mean at this point we're screwed
anyway so just matter of either tryna
get away with something the contents of
that that you'd like some belt whether
we can like sort of stabilize the
driveway are you to tape it down with
gas tape yes
I'm liking how this is coming along so
far I think once the side panels are on
everything will sort of come together
and it'll at least be eye-catching do we
have an optical drive screw there's one
awesome okay what needs to be done okay
I still need to mount the hard drive on
the front needs to go on oh hold on not
yet front can go on very soon if you
tighten these screws the front king
Galanos and we're good is this a hard
drives that day oh well all right
it can be whatever you want it to be
pony boy let me run this first he's not
yeah that that was the plan it came all
by I don't know if the GPS benefit
anymore on that hard drive now he's just
a little boy it might it might just on
the balls it just wait
what no well okay that's come out for
now that much is clear
can we can we just mount it on drill
some holes mountain bottom we can
breathe we can but and not actually
about a powerful beach because of your
optical drive just unplug the optimum no
I'm not unplugging it just wait okay
hope I'm just hold on let me get what is
this oh no this is fine this is good at
the time these stupid thing
no I don't think we have time to remove
it so hard to line up cat now I just
have to make sure that I don't push down
but that went in didn't it yeah okay
okay okay okay fine you plan for the
hard drive then you gotta unplug the
optical drive hold on cuddly on the
bottom hold on you think it's gonna
reach maybe Jesus Christ I'm naturally
like sad that it reaches good okay this
drill bit for screws this is what you
used I love your sadness was that we use
a lot I'm relishing the sadness right
now okay like you're slowing us down
I'll hold on which one this one yeah
that please but hold on hold on hold on
hold on let me actually check the spot
first imma bust things simple using the
game is almost get things done
it would be so late if it wasn't for
your hard drive we wouldn't be so late
if it wasn't for you
well I people this habit no no nod see
it doesn't help it's um it's uh I hit
the radiator okay so yeah we could go
there we believe I can't do my optical
drive though this table it came and find
things where the hell of the scissors go
I know they're like right under my nose
you live like right did you take the
scissors no I'm blind I'm going crazy
going crazy at that time of day yep the
hell does scissors go all that uh taping
sort of worked up an appetite it's not a
bribe something for him to don't believe
what what I did look with it working
hard tired just trying to get this
bribed I mean like sludge I just won I
just came from England from and
everything
I do this all the time if I use this put
the hop hard drive on top of this put
that in the bottom back to burn okay
active break and I present to you your
hard drive stance that's screwed in okay
okay I don't know how to fix that down
we need more screws I guess and more
drilling more screws market or we take
the crap out of it we have no tape we
don't have any tape that would be useful
so no no way it's a hard drive we can't
we actually cannot have fast amount okay
so if it went on like that it would sit
you can even flip it over to give
yourself a little bit more height like
that I don't think we could've gotten
you pulled any more perfect if we'd
actually measured them properly is that
I can't and it knows more yeah yeah move
on move on here here here gonna be get
it turned on or something it'll hold
yeah I got I got a screw didn't I got to
plug it in first anyway so we need a
minute double-checking everything 1 4
pin connector is good friend panel
connectors all good yeah hit it punch it
Chewie
artists
ah
I want to see them windows before you
fatty ways half now Lillian oh my god
could it cover the gash and the no not
quite
- we don't have my kid anymore I lost my
kid yeah we have we have Brandon Neil
Brandon's kid I mean if there was a
judging category for creative use of
sponsor product hey not bad
you know let these holes down here don't
look bad at all okay so the bench is
done I'm pulling up real bench okay so
if we were to just wrap it you've never
built it you can open um yeah and like
what if we just what if we just wrapped
it in RGB I was kind of thinking even
just like the top I don't know if we're
gonna be able to make those kinds of
yeah no there's no way like dad okay uh
so so if we're done with our benchmarks
do we have like enough time to just
rerun them now or do we only get one run
what settings you guys is exactly the
ones that we're agreed upon at the
beginning of the yet do like screen shot
GTA settings are like uh yes we can
render screen shots with all the
settings you use okay sure GTA we're
starting with tomb raider so for tomb
raider we haven't set the very high fxaa
okay very high ethics AAA and is there a
dead cut-off time for when benchmarks
could have to see slide 5 5 yeah so then
something five ish okay
got it cool thanks ah but can you hear
me those like immediately we got a run
presence numerator now yeah I'll send
you three so yeah we're all like all
iron folic we're actually still
transferring the games to the internal
or internal hard drive which you take
another five ten minutes it's about
three four no it's for forty four forty
honestly I got to say I'm surprised that
they're that they've got their
benchmarks run and are asking could be
apparently will Eadie probably stole the
hard drive so you think their hard drive
is like no well their hard drive isn't
working and then we gave them ours and
we know that would have taken a lot
we're taking a while to get out of there
and then you have to get all the games
on it and you have to install them so
they're not running off that drive
many bad people many people yeah oh well
there's this gap in the side of it now
before you punch me no we need to hear
back from them can you can you go follow
up with them like yo we really get the
benchmarks winner more than I need to
know what settings you guys are using
cuz like we have to rerun them if
they're wrong so what did you do for
Ashes hey guys what do you do for ashes
never run it yet we're probably gonna
have to do standard because have you
have you tried the harder ones they're
like insane okay cool
standard dx11 did you want us sending
you guys settings like are you guys
building up and you haven't actually run
anything yet pretty sure that's what
that was I'm pretty sure that's what
that was - okay so should we just like
should we just take the backing off and
like Yolo this I don't think there's any
other option
socially could you have five meters it's
gonna like take off yeah we have to go
around this thing like five times
yeah well I was hoping to kind of do
here can you can you hold it up yes but
I'm gonna have to stop every once in a
while win like this finally mmm peace or
something that takes good this is so
stupid
this is not gonna win us a bet like I
feel bad even taking valuable time out
of our celebrity judges a day to look at
this what I had imagined my head was
like like like tight all the way haha
it's not even real yet it gets worse
natural God hey hold on just hold on
this might be the best place to start
where's the other end where's the
controller box it's taped to the bottom
who controller box of Texas
so I wish we just got flowers even if we
just like walked up and handed them to
Jay okay you ready
what if you do here honestly I don't
think we have time we actually have
seven minutes to have benchmarking
finished I could do around the base
under the HP logo right here with titer
bars Luke's I am resigned to this why we
still have multiple games to run we so
basically what happened was the hardest
possible location any time for that we
are we're just not starting benchmarks
you're just now starting benchmark yeah
okay well that's not too bad we're not
too bad I mean we have a functional
system and you know that
I've been in dance for you okay l LD so
are they like they're starting
benchmarking now starting benchmarking
them okay so this is very interesting
we basically can decide now because we
agreed that over one hour of
benchmarking you got ten percent of your
score deducted per ten minutes it is 507
there's the ish we're done benchmarking
now right oh we still have one more game
can we finish it in three minutes well I
think we get to decide when the issues
but yeah we all figured it's convenient
we also didn't start benchmarking till
4:30 I don't turn that but I mean that's
not an hour of benchmarking I think the
big thing to do even that they're just
starting their benchmarking now rather
than to duck 30% I think the big thing
is to go in confident held and look you
can have all the time you need I kind of
want to destroy their hopes and dreams
no no no will destroy their hopes and
dreams later we said five ish and we had
also said when we laid out the rules at
the beginning that every ten minutes
over the deadline was minus ten percent
I believe to your score that's correct
we did say that
so Luke and I have discussed this and
we've decided that we are so confident
that we want to we want to go up against
your guys's full score okay that's
that's quite noble of you that's how we
feel well I appreciate that for sure
yeah but um okay well that's that's good
to know
I can't use those how is it sharp we're
just gonna we're gonna go back to our
garage where things are same the world
makes any sense and we're gonna kind of
pack up and get ready to head over to
the celebrity judges okay well I feel
even better that was a real pick-me-up
you know that might legitimately be
better than telling Sharpie I saw some
apparently apparently they're under the
impression now that we've covered eye
system assurance I think it's much much
less turbulent I think they might have
just jumped the gun of it it's pretty
bad but it might be better than color
shirt what
that better not be before I imagine ated
more than that but if they did any more
than that than 10% won't help so like we
actually helped them a lot I think it's
going to take them like half an hour to
actually run all their benchmarks so
that's literally 30 percent right there
and then we gave them a hard drive they
wouldn't have been able to do it you did
say maximum 30% per overtime but they'd
have to like cope by our trucks if I
didn't have any money for you yeah
that's true
no I guess we said they get money back
for failing components but they would
add like it would have taken into like
late tonight do you think I dropped it
would be ironic some to lose rap guard
wars against me because you are awesome
oh no there is so much promise in our
build Oh No so I just got done doing the
back side panel upside down I think I'm
gonna go shoot myself legit really Paul
do you have a gun no I'm having that as
Matt purchase well hopefully Jane has a
sense of humor Enzo will do well have
we'll have we'll have a system facing
this way right but he'll come in this
way and then we'll flip the villain no
no I know be like Jane look at the back
and like like this
Ingram's over there yeah totally
naturally and then again we designed it
that way I don't even know like take it
off it flipped over
did you peel it off yeah I guess I could
all right I mean I gotta run all these
benchmarks sure sure sure
you just double-check okay I'm assuming
assuming it will be the side panel after
an event or to a pancake oh my god oh
it's gonna be such an ordeal okay
I don't know man okay yeah I have to do
it there's no choice I literally have no
choice this is a big biggest derp this
goes beyond there
and can't even hold the camera studies
bad so bad oh my gosh okay so I have
just finished reorienting all the
letters for our side panel here and it
actually looks pretty good you wouldn't
even notice that something went horribly
wrong
I still have to kind of trim out some of
the tape here on the tops just to give a
little bit more spacing some more
Headroom but for the most part I think
Jay still gonna enjoy this and let's
just you know let's hope that he prefers
to be on the bottom than the top so when
Luke and Linus came out and agreed to
drop the time penalty for me and Paul
because we're taking so long
I was super relieved obviously because I
was like there's no way we're gonna win
this contest if we're getting penalized
30% on our score for taking half an hour
longer than we should it gave me more
time to actually focus on the RGB
elements of the case I was able to like
trick it out a bit more and put some
more thought and effort into the whole
design of like just taping it like crazy
and making it look really nice which
like okay if we can at least win the RGB
theme portion and when the 10% modifier
to that that's still going to outperform
what they were what they were able to do
with the overclock so overall I felt
pretty good about it I do already feel
drawn to this one a little bit I mean
I've got a be a little partial to this
okay so I had absolutely no idea what to
expect going into this I wasn't even
really told of a team other than RGB and
scrapyard Wars with RGB already skin
kind of a stretch the cool thing is I
honestly can't even begin to guess which
team made what well the one of the right
eye kind of reminds me of Legos which is
already kind of kind of a throwback I do
like the message the message is true
the case also is a bit of a throwback I
like the floppy
I do wish it was blowing though but then
again RGB this is red green blue right
doesn't have to be lighting necessarily
I got an Intel box on the front right
here I'm assuming this is I'm sort of an
advertisement potentially of what's
inside making sure what this is yeah
this seems like something Kyle would do
I'm just saying I mean I ever I feel
like I'm lying my instincts of lying to
me
because I'm trying to guess who would
created what but I do I don't see Linus
approving this to be honest so I'm a
little conflicted I do like the glowing
beam over here this one has a lot more
labor involved that's for sure
so I I do wish that this had actual
lighting in it but I feel like there was
a there was a bit more attention to
detail on this one here I do feel like
this one's lacking a little bit of glow
though Wow so we do
Wow oh my goodness yeah I like I like
that response all right okay let's take
a look there's color the electrical they
only got onions yellow is not red green
or believers Y is a combination either
is white neither is neither they are
byproducts of those colors neither are
these different colored water than RGB
that your LEDs experience your looks
like it's in bondage like the long strip
yeah also requires external power that
is brass that's that means not evoke
light an interesting video card you guys
in toxicology I can't actually look into
yours
yeah it had a window or something
appreciating the hardware getting a good
look at it but I'm like no I want to say
that I accurately guess whose computers
with who based on the comments because
it all came down to this I said Linus
would have never approved this
Oh j-just a quick distraction I mean
nothing oh nothing to do with the
Honorable I also know there's a couple
things I thought to myself to him like
this seemed like a Linus tactic I think
I said that but then I went and it's
really bringing boxes down with him I
don't think so
so I don't know where the boxes came
from but I just know for a fact this
message would not have been approved by
the ball okay I'll get all right all
right all right okay so let's let's
let's put up let's put up or shut up
here you guys got your scores ready Hey
yeah spin a bench for the bench 671 you
are joking 672 oh no way but with the
weighted scores that's pretty much brick
well I'm gonna venture to say it doesn't
have a 3960 yes they are the RGV show
okay I'm a champion
Wow okay none of the same real bench why
don't you guys go first on this one okay
ninety-three thousand seven eighty three
eighty nine 346 you want to go ash's
first sure we had fifty five point six
oh my god people 1.10 when the first
gaming result came in I was devastated
absolutely devastated how could they
possibly have a gtx 980ti how could they
possibly have gotten that and the
processor they did uh always should have
taken the 30% down from the thing we're
actually gonna win I mean that first
score that was read off when we beat
their Cinebench score by one point I was
like that's good and then we started get
to the gaming benchmarks in particular I
mean if one gaming benchmark you went on
you're probably going to do well on the
other so obviously for us you
tomb raider why don't you guys wanna go
first time sure okay
109 point eight Hagan 109 point eight
I okay so I tested I tested yes it's
true I tested res the tomb raider myself
however I just taken over for Paul he
had been running benchmarks of rise the
Tomb Raider for the last half hour or so
and I just hopped on it was like okay
it's good good change something and he
just said it's good to go just go ahead
and click run just leave it as is that's
obviously not a good score then
nope yeah it's a 59 point came to 92 so
I think it's a 59 point night with vsync
on I don't know cow iraq-iran that one
you told me to just run into default
whatever will you just not even running
it all day and I was like what am I do
you're like just run it a dude
the residue term rating score clearly
had vsync on it was only 60 frames per
second we didn't have time you check to
catch that and then when right back the
other direction and we're gonna have to
hand it right back to Luca - because
with the weighted scores that right
single rise of the Terminator scored
dragged us down so far that suddenly
they were beating us you said just run
it as oh alright that sounds like these
things otherwise could be intervening
that's what EPA Drive what do you got we
have 117 frames
yeah we're 101.9 nine for honor for
honor one thirty point one eight one
twenty three point seven five we still
don't know the average the average score
so we actually have two yet doesn't
really punched it that's right of the
tumors coordinate driller hurt okay is
everything else vsync on every time I
install it so no idea 39.92 I know
oh yeah weird weird whispered oh yeah I
don't know you were ahead of oh no I
don't know you guys let's just okay so
hold on a second hold on a second okay
I'm kind of critius
you spent a while son Felix a Nimba 574
65 team RG beast 550 for point fish
obviously disappointment from our side
no it's all done
we have the RGB factory with RGB fected
I think we have no the RGB Factory okay
okay
before I continue I love everybody in
this room's gonna be a lengthy
controversy together I gave it to RGB
because this just was a this was phoned
in this was like this was an effort
it was the labor that went into the
taping of this that sold it so RGB comes
away with six hundred and ten points and
Tina in BA comes away with 574 yeah
alright not bad someone say home-field
advantage of a matter in this one I
think that was Wow that was illustrated
that was like back and forth so I think
we have to be the big men here and
present them with their trophies check
it out you guys
you officially one scratch are worth
even five I'm very proud and thank you
the guy on the top is ripping open his
ribcage as you're saying we're really
not sure looks really bad like the alien
seed in there that's strange
he's showing us it's inside yeah well
we're I'm very honored I have all read
up scrap yard where season five winner
you played hard and you're up get it
and our awesome on our murderers up did
you guys plan later yeah yeah hold on
well thank you all right well I think
I'm gonna get in skimp and just bail on
the winner
and I'm not glad we gave them the 30% so
thank you guys for watching scratch art
war season 5 huge thank you to Paul and
Kyle for giving us that their their
space for three days for competing hard
and I'm not going to thank them for
winning but uh thank you guys thank you
guys
thank you huge shout-out to our
celebrity judges who ultimately dealt us
to defeat but I'll take his hand anyway
I swear I didn't know going into this
thank you guys for watching and being
part of it and we'll see you again next
time thanks to our fix using the fresh
books for sponsoring this season of
scrapyard worry starter a 30-day free
trial of fresh books over at fresh books
calm forward-slash scrap yard Wars and
use coupon code Wars to get five dollars
off any purchase of $10 or more over it
I pick sitcom forge / - yeah we paid 15
bucks how much did you guys pay for your
SSD but is this it is this an external
drive this isn't even the one we gave
you hold on a minute now when you gave
us hold on a minute now are you guys
using hardware that you didn't buy well
technically
whoa whoa whoa the hard drive we were
Apes that we didn't buy was defective
blame not drive well we had it is all
her fantasy has to be has to be only
clover - there's no mountain yeah it was
last Drive dude so that's when you stole
no that's not what were you where did it
come from
it came it came from the hard drive
manufacturers we went through the great
ventures including the one you gave us
and none of them none of them I think
you should go get the other one the baby
sense there's a system oh thank you we
continue - ah maybe we can revisit this
one like we already shot the Astra oh
that's the magic of video editing my
friend it has come to my attention that
team are the beast in the RGV only has
the moon hmm
there is an essence they have three dry
snow as you me we have an optical drive
an SSD and a hard drive oh and they have
an SSD and a floppy drive and a hard
drive but their hard drive which was so
very cleverly concealed Sherwood their
hard drive was not actually obtained
with scrapyard wars money so hold on to
these for a minute because I would like
to ceremoniously take them back and
declare victory 14 in Bob can I can I
just say that I don't wanna be
associated with the TV and that I do not
endorse their power as it did what is
magnetic yeah there's magnetic so I'd
like you guys to read out your new
trophies here okay
it's so scrapyard worth season 5 loser
you lost at least you got to be on the
show I have my eyesight isn't working so
thank you to everyone thank you to G our
special celebrity judge for helping us
out staying so late after these guys so
inconsiderately kept
you suck your hours after I change my
vote ha ha ha thank you to Luke for
being my fantastic partner thank you to
our camera people you guys weren't you
guys were awesome Thank You camera
people awesome fantastic thank you to
our audience for watching and I think
that pretty much wraps up the faces you
guys need it from
who was it what who what should you was
it how could I had time to do that when
I was so clearly doing all of it
oh this was that bus is bearing down on
me I should all right so here's when I
came down to obviously we were running
over time haha I'm obviously the
decision we had to make was basically
concede and you know avoid all of the
textual and drama that we provided for
all of you wow this is Evan conductor
the consideration Beverly then we have
to make this a challenge and it was very
close they should take he goes back so
yeah yeah I mean we didn't have enough
