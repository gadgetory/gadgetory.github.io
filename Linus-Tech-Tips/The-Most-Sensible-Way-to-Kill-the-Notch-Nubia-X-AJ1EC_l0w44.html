you by D brand the D brand grip case and
prism screen protector are available at
the link in the video description I'm
finally on hands with the Nubia X and I
gotta say I am really impressed by a lot
of aspects of this device given that
this is from a brand that I have
personally never actually been hands-on
with before so everyone's got a
different sort of concept for how we
move towards an all screen phone whether
it's a foldable device or a pop-up
selfie camera or a facial recognition
scanner or whatever the case may be
their solution is the one that I
actually personally think makes the most
sense with the technology we have today
they just went and put an OLED display
on the back of the phone so instead of
having to have a dedicated selfie camera
at all you just use your rear camera in
order to take a selfie you go ahead and
hit that selfie button and boom now
you're on the OLED screen on the back
ooh I'm in pretty mode you know what I'm
gonna go I'm gonna go full not pretty
yeah we all knew that wasn't gonna be
pretty anyway then you go ahead and flip
it back around and there it is now the
cool thing is that it would have been a
lot of added cost to put a 5.1 inch OLED
display on the back of the phone just
for the sake of taking selfies but
they've actually built some really
interesting other functionality into it
as well if you are into it for whatever
reason you can actually switch to it and
use it as the primary display of the
phone just by flipping it around you can
configure that to not happen
automatically though if you want so you
can put a add a gesture where you just
press these two buttons and it'll switch
it around or you can actually set it up
instead of in mirror mode to be in a
mode that they're calling multitasking
mode so obviously this is a bad example
but I went to lunch a game and I think
it was looking for a data connection it
didn't work it's okay don't go oh hey it
did work so here you can have the game
running on your primary screen and then
you can flip it back over and go yeah I
got a reply to a quick message but you
don't actually have to do that drag down
minimize your game whole thing and you
could use it for really like any number
of things that is an absolutely
incredible idea another thing that you
can do is you can configure it as an
additional input so you can set
zooms here that you can use as for
example this is also a gaming
application as triggers for firing a
weapon or whatever the case may be
that's pretty neat too
so as shocking as this feels to me it's
actually more than just a gimmick as far
as I can tell now I'm not crazy
impressed with the quality of the rear
camera so we're not necessarily solving
the problem of taking the best selfies
ever by putting the screen on the back
of this particular phone but the overall
fit and finish of this thing is just
surprisingly good in the specs are great
too so snapdragon 845 up to 8 gigs of
ram 512 gigs of storage they're quoting
6 hours of screen time 6 hours of
continuous use with a 3,800 milliamp
hour battery yeah that's right a 38
hundred million power battery and
there's even one more cool thing that is
kind of up oh hi oh hi did nobody else
ever think of this thing you look at the
front you go ok there's no room for a
fingerprint sensor there obviously it's
not in screen unfortunately at this time
if you look at the back you can go oh
well there's no fingerprint sensor there
either so they've done a side
fingerprint sensor like we've seen
I mean Sony's done that in the past
that's not particularly new but this is
new they put it on both sides so I
initially thought oh it's ambidextrous I
can do it this way or this way
and use my thumb every time but what
they're actually using it for us to
increase the security of the device so
it now checks not just one fingerprint
but two fingerprints so that you can
instead of having it what is it whatever
it is like one in a million or 1 in
100,000 or whatever the chances are of
an accidental fingerprint match now it's
checking two fingerprints increasing the
device's security pretty freakin sick
finally we've got a feature that's less
futuristic and more of a throwback but
definitely one I'm happy to see it's got
an IR blaster on it hell yeah
so there's gonna be the guys that are
like huh what's that who cares and then
there's gonna be you guys that are like
it's amazing so if you're into it you're
into it and if you're not you know and I
totally get it but there's one thing
that we should all be into our sponsor
deep rent the deep brand grip is they're
super grippy case that's basically Linus
proof in terms of its drop resistance
got precision cutouts for all of your
you know cameras touch sensors all that
good stuff
and of course is customizable with the
deep brain skin of your choice also on
the D brand website very very new is
their prism screen protector so that's
got an included applicator that allows
you to put it on perfectly every time
it's got shocking impact resistance and
you guys can check out both of those
things at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching don't
miss any of our CES 2019 coverage you
guys by making sure that you are
subscribed to line this tech tips it's
really responsive too especially
compared to the foldable phone earlier
mmm it's like fidget gyroscope screen
