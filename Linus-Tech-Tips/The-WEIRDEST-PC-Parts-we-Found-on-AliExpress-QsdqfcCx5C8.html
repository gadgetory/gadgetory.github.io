at a motherboard and I'm like alright so
you got all these PCI Express slots
right the graphics card goes here but
then you got all these other ones what
are people actually putting on these
things so I start clicking around on
Aliexpress I'm like wow there's some
really weird stuff that you can put in a
PCI Express slot so I a challenge
actually rather I asked Jake to issue a
challenge to four other members of our
writing staff to scour eBay wish
Aliexpress and more and find what they
believe is the weirdest PCI Express
expansion card we've provided no
definition for weirdest it's going to be
down to judgment from your peers
who managed to find the weirdest thing
and I'm participating as well so and
dice is here in spirit and the winner
gets a trophy right yes and it's
engraved in everywhere is it you know
what's not a surprise the fact that I'm
gonna segue to our sponsor right now
with pulse weight you can remotely
monitor manage and control all of your
Windows Mac and Linux machines from one
app create your free account today at
the link in the video description
- alright Riley you're only first
alright
okay Riley's first see how nonchalant I
am about this because that's the amount
of confidence I have stop it only I can
not one not two not three these just
blood for sirs listen it's a cool one
but you had to buy these this is a small
very small PCIe card ever seen something
like that
what's that USB ports yeah that goes in
there
yeah USB into a USB yeah do you know the
potential of this no you just keep going
forever
adding more and more let's find out pci
card this look that goes in here can we
just wait wait whoa the bench is on me
no I turned it off for the power supply
off you know that's not going there that
can't go in there
yes okay no I don't think this is a PCIe
x16 no what you were buying no I didn't
okay so our USB graphics card is working
so what is this like a plx chip here
yeah that's definitely what it is yes
please
I have no idea like what is the pin
mapping here though like this is what
you call it there's only nine there's
only nine conductors well hose you don't
need that many okay well well it works
so like does it have ray tracing yeah so
this is an RT X 27 T on what is this an
8700 K so we should be expecting
somewhere in the neighborhood of 250
plus FPS okay
well let's see how we do here then shall
we yes so basically what's happening is
instead of just converting PCI Express
to a USB cable which is kind of like
just using a PCI Express riser except
you're using the USB connector and cable
it's taking the same PCIe 1x interface
using some kind of a PL X or a hub chip
of some sort or switching chip and then
it's turning the single 1x interface
into 4 1 X interfaces and so this is
probably fine but if we were to hook for
graphics cards up at the same time and
all four of them are actually doing
something we beat you
we'd be we'd be not and you don't want
to do that right now
Gaming I don't want to try it but
daisy-chaining no I don't think there's
any point daisy chaining them but
running all four of them yes good let's
do it just try change the chaining at
once okay turn the power play all right
if you factor out the shorting out the
board Oh a Power Move you know what it
did it that FPS though is not this was
not ideal oh wait wait wait wait wait we
just caught our FPS in half and just see
how many noobs you can poem that's
pretty rough oh man your time traveling
for your consideration you have before
you a system that could enable you to
place a GPU anywhere in your house while
keeping your regular PC right next to
you so pretty awesome but at what cost
at the cost of a few frame a few what is
that what are frames and here we have a
PCI oscilloscope whoa wait it's PCI oh
wait how does that work well I assumed
you would get at least a PCI Express
card oh excuse me I thought there was
sort of a minimum bar here for like you
actually you told me specifically PCIe
or PCI that's true this was the
conversation yeah yeah okay well then
why didn't your test bench have a PCI
slot on it smart yeah I wasn't expecting
anybody to do it especially for
something that costs $600 more like
seven $700 are those PCI's know those
are pci-x see you later
what are those
that's not a PCI right oh wait what
you can't yeah nothing about that yeah
this it doesn't post with it in it so
there's nothing that we can reconfigure
to so this is something that is actually
pretty cool for me so that's of 7950 GX
- yes I thought this was super cool
because I had never seen that this is
how they used to actually do dual GPU
cards basic it's literally to Riley
didn't write it no I think it's cool
yeah so that's never seen this instead
of like your Titan Z Zed whatever if
you're Canadian or not how they had
those two GPUs on one card they actually
just gave you two cards that were like
duct-taped together and you get one slot
and you just stick it in and that's how
you did Quad SLI back in the day GPU
seed way two of these yeah so this one
apparently worked but when I got it
actually had one of the capacitors
knocked off and then this one was like
falling off did you hot glue it on and
all that I stole this capacitor from
another mother board because the leads
were broken and then to kind of keep it
from breaking I put some hot glue on
there as I sort of silastic so hopefully
it works I put a lot of that genuinely
took me like an hour this was back when
they used to really falsely advertise
they really these cards so it's got 1
gig 512 bit on the back but I'm pretty
sure what they mean is 2 times 512 well
let's let's check her eBay a 256-bit oh
and I'm looking at the card and said to
I'm saying art eBay seller was an honest
guy okay he said to buy half the cake
okay guy oh my god I don't know getting
pretty close to Alex territory here hey
the computer turned on that's true
that's pretty different yeah you're on
the podium believe whatever you want
there's no way there's a Windows - I'd
be surprised if there's a Windows 7
driver for this that's a dead video card
he said it was working so these look
like these look like dead pixels kind of
but they're not please don't waste time
Dede Ewing it just you can try and
install your driver but like
it's not gonna work and your card is
broken lets you select it and then it's
like yeah I can't believe how much money
you guys spent on $70 and not working
hardware's damaged in shipping over 30
bucks you don't sound convinced
yes oh and this is the deluxe nice
really nice it's like a horse race where
the horse and race in first hey so you
have other problems coming for you
though
no raids to find what OS were you
planning to boot here I have Windows 7
32 bit oh yeah on that drive oh yeah
yeah oh yeah is that not gonna happen no
no okay what what do I boot on this XP
oh Jesus
look at these pads okay to be fair it's
like this graphics card transports the
character models back to the era it came
from are you telling me right now that
this is working because I'm physically
holding a capacitor in the place on the
graphics card let's try that and go in a
minute like is your finger comfortable
are you good it's kind of warm but I'm
yeah I'm fine all right how do we save I
don't why would you can can you please
play oh I think this is starting to burn
my finger yeah tag me in buddy
oh you got like what that's what did it
it just stopped it stopped as soon as
our like oh this thing is holding on the
power oh that's that's Jake right there
Oh God there we are literally repairing
this graphics card with scotch tape in
the same
wait are you telling me that the tape is
doing a better job than Riley ever could
my finger was burning what do you want
me to do about 8 FPS on I got my
assistant okay no artifacts no artifacts
it's the best GPU no artifacts to speak
of this is exactly what we need right
now you plug this in it's a fan up
sensibly it just blows air right away
and the bonus part of it away
it can cool down your glute on
capacitors and make your other stuff
work what value on value was this plan
no that's just how handy these are you
need this in your life right now let me
show you how this works do you know
what's really good about them I'm pretty
sure the plastic is UV reactive we
really need it this is how those
infomercials always start look the
package says light it up does this even
count it doesn't even have anything we
might need to modify it this slot like
yeah it's lots it's for PCI this is
super old oh we can use it to cool my
stuff I think it came with Amazon Prime
actually this was in stock ready to go
I'm confused as to like what why does it
look like it's a children's toy from a
dollar store because this used to be the
style when it came to like hardcore PC
modding I'm not even joking unlike some
people I only spent $20 but wait there's
more look at this little dial go from
low to high yeah does fit in a PC I use
one sorta so it's gonna blow air at the
front what about the sofa
thank goodness for our og shielding's
okay um here we go ladies and gentlemen
I'll put it down on the low something oh
my god
and it turned off but the lights are on
a little lower a little lower yet is it
too much
one fan words wait really
it might not be enough power you know
it's plenty of power barely even blowing
any hair okay so James is done I still
need to go but in the meantime we have
an update over in Alex land we have a
hard drive detected we have an optical
drive detective and theoretically we
have a Windows XP boot CD have you ever
seen an ethernet card this small yeah
the one that I had Oh an Ethernet card
this is how I intend to plug it in now
you'll have to give me a moment
gentlemen
so first I will be needing yes the vac
eand
mini PCIe two PCIe converter Wireless
this oh hey wait that's not that
interesting all right I need and I fix
it kit as well I I have my sincere
doubts as to whether or not this is
going to work at this point we have gone
from PCI Express 1x to mini PCIe to
PCMCIA I just need this here here we go
so this goes in this is PCMCIA it was an
old laptop expansion standard going this
way or this way don't actually know that
way yep
okay well I like that spring action to
USB
what hold on ladies and gentlemen
okay two dual PCI Express 16x then we've
got a PCI Express 4x interface at the
bottom of this card here that we have
adapted using this card to you dot two
then we've got a u dot 2 2 m dot 2 board
installed in that which has an m dot 2
to u dot to the other end like mini SAS
HD whatever this is called
then we've got a mini SAS HD to u dot 2
over here plugged into a board that does
u dot 2 to PCI Express 4x where finally
we have installed a network card now
will this work I have no idea something
just burned hold on a minute no I still
have an entry because I did convert back
to PCI Express at some point I can cut
out some parts of my chain here my
submission is a PCI Express to u dot 2
to m dot 2 to u dot 2 to u dot 2 to PCI
Express 4 X 2 network adapter get out of
my way whoa disrespect
well the slot that I wanted to plug into
is broken because of my previous attempt
I wonder if my network card is dead ok
cuz even that didn't work this should be
pretty straightforward this is just PCI
you to know if now on just a gosh darn
minute here is it just a bad network
card cuz that's why it that's why it was
gonna
fire right okay wait for it this is it
ladies and gentlemen my time to shine
you know what you know this is like let
me speak your language it's like in for
tonight when you get shot and you're
crawling around but you're not dead yet
but there's no way you're gonna win this
log out nope why turn your computer off
I'm installing drivers as we speak I am
moments away from having this bully
operation okay
my entry is this graphics card what I
mean
network card isn't it adorable that's
cute yeah Wow
you didn't kill anything in putting that
in
got a link can be a close up meanwhile
over in Alex land how are we doing so it
seems like it is working here it is I
think yeah so now we just need a program
to use it you didn't even know what
program so we we would need to install
LabVIEW and then it should work just
fine how much does a LabVIEW license I
don't know okay I think it's I think we
just have to do the voting now you have
to vote for two people and the
competition is without any real
guidelines the weirdest PCI or PCIe
device so weirdest starting with the
most disappointing thing of tonight me
and James with just one vote oh and then
you get Linus with two hey I'm on the
podium baby with two yeah and then it's
Alex before so we all said yeah so I'm
happy to present you today that's it
just shut up I don't know how to open it
but this is a quality we have scissors
no it's good we're good this was the
