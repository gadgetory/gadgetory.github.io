brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital this you guys is not
your average Corsair k70 keyboard this
is the world's first fully RGB backlit
mechanical keyboard featuring Cherry MX
switches now you might say to me
Linus we have tons of RGB backlit
keyboards why would we care about
mechanical in which case I would direct
you to any of the other videos that
we've ever made about why mechanical
keyboards are vastly superior and
particularly Cherry MX is a favorite of
all the staff here at Linus tech tips so
you cannot replicate the quality at
least from what we've tried in the past
with other differently branded switches
it just doesn't really happen they're
still manufactured in Germany and
there's not much stuff you can say that
about these days all right
so onto this keyboard first up well okay
it's RGB backlit second up what I was
kind of expecting to see was
programmable backlighting and you could
just kind of change the full backlight
to any color maybe like WASD zone to go
along with one of the other zones or
something like that what we got is
probably one of the most complex one of
the most complex keyboards ever I mean
they're actually using a digital signage
processor from Panasonic the first time
this has ever been implemented in a
consumer-grade device in order to drive
what is effectively an LED display I
mean that's what this processors for
it's for digital signage large format
LED displays and that's what we're
looking at here so I've seen sixteen
point eight million color RGB backlit
keyboards that really when you tinker
around with them and you configure all
the settings in the in the you know the
color dials is probably more like 256
colors that is not the case here we have
an extremely wide variety we've also got
okay alright let's talk about the LED
reliability so you've got all these
colors and one of the things that I was
really concerned about when I first
heard about this keyboard was you see
you see LEDs die I have a K 90 that's
got a dead LED on it's like yeah it
still works just
find the keys which works but it's not
perfect anymore and that doesn't make me
happy so what I was informed of is that
they're using a completely different
method of mounting the LEDs in order to
dramatically increase reliability now
the way that leds on keyboards
apparently usually die is actually from
ESD so electrostatic discharge and by
mounting the leds within the key switch
rather than to the PCB of the keyboard
you can virtually eliminate that so in
spite of the fact that the LEDs are much
more complex we should still be looking
at a situation where it's very difficult
for them to fail even over an extended
period of time now in terms of lighting
patterns courser has pretty much
everything under the sun you can do your
standard you know wave or breathing or
fully lit here or color zones or
individual colors on each key or you can
have you know reactive reactive fade-ins
and fade-outs and you can adjust the
timing of that or like you know laser
beams friggin zapping across the thing
and they have a very complex piece of
software that's going to launch at the
same time of this this keyboard that's
going to allow you to configure a lot of
that stuff don't worry there will be
like an easy beginners mode for just
like well I just want an orange keyboard
can I just have that no one's ever made
an orange LED backlit keyboard before
why can't I have that if you want that
then that's still just fine or you can
do some of the more advanced stuff or
because they're keeping the software
architecture open you can even code your
own way of lighting up the keyboard and
have it do whatever you could possibly
want you can share that with friends and
courser is encouraging the modding
community to just kind of take charge
and run away with it if that's what they
want to do in addition to being fully
programmable in terms of the lighting
every single key on the keyboard is
fully programmable we've seen this with
SteelSeries is latest SteelSeries engine
software and it's something that I'm
personally very excited about I think
it's great so not only could you remap
one to seven if you wanted to you could
remap it to control seven so you can do
macros you can do straight remap things
whatever you want every key on the
keyboard can be changed into something
else if you prefer it that way now of
course
the question you're going to be asking
me now is Linus how many hundreds of
dollars am I going to have to pay for it
and Corsair is being very wishy-washy
about it they won't tell me a straight
price I was like okay tell me this
here's our 200 is it 250 and they said
okay we won't tell you but we will tell
you that there are RGB backlit membrane
keyboards that will cost more than this
which to me means under 200 although I
could be wrong but I hope I'm right
because if this comes in around 150 to
170 I think it is a knockout punch to
pretty much anyone who is not delivering
such an advanced LED backlit mechanical
keyboard it's going to be available in
red switches black switches and - no not
black switches red switches brown
switches and blue switches at the start
and so that addresses one of my other
complaints about Corsair keyboards and
that's that they seem to always lead
with red and I'm more of a brown guy so
there you go guys if you've always
wanted an Easter themed keyboard Corsair
will be delivering it sometime this year
don't miss any of our CES 2014 coverage
here guys our trip to the show is
powered by NCI XCOM your source for
great technology selection and service
as well as our other sponsors Corsair
which has nothing to do with why I'm
raving about this keyboard if you guys
will notice I was actually raving about
this before I even seen it yet because I
was super excited and a Western Digital
big thanks to those guys for allowing us
to be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
