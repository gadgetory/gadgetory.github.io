brought to you by western digital Intel
and steelseries hey guys I'm back at the
Indy mega booth with Scott for the game
called necro now can you tell me more
about what this game is really about
sure so necro is a game about playing an
undead necromancer right so you
basically summon a bunch of monsters
and then go raid innocent villages and
utterly destroy them so basically it's
the best premise for a game ever i
noticed i watched the trailer on the
indie mega booth trailer that's kind of
an interesting thing to say but that's
exactly what I death right yeah yeah and
what it reminded me a lot of was when I
was a kid and played warcraft 3 I know
it's kind of weird but I was getting
played warcraft 3 when you turn as
Arthas one of the first missions you
have is you get this huge army and then
you just wreck a town yeah that's really
what this reminded me of is did you get
where did you get inspiration from you
just nailed it basically for warcraft 3
like I mean the whole undead faction I
love the end of action like the little
meat wagon like we have something
arguing called the meat bag which is
basically like this bag on your back
full of limbs and you throw them at
people like it just came straight from
the meat wagon which is like a big
corpse train it's amazing but our main
inspirations were basically really like
late 90s games Dungeon Keeper is my
biggest one ever i love like just
monsters and you know each monster game
has its own personality its own AI
patterns like it really acts different
than every other monster so that adds a
lot of the strategy of our game but it
also makes every creature feel like it
has you know its own identity and that's
I think huge in a game like this where
it's all based on monsters so I mean
dungeon keeper was a massive influence
for me just because of that alone and
then I don't know if you heard of this
one but myth the fallen lords bye Bunji
before you know the other Bungie game
yes oh my god but that was one my
favorite games of all time and basically
in that game anytime something was
destroyed it like just turning all these
little jibs and the battlefield like
staying the blood and the blood never
went away the whole entire time and all
the jibs like you end up with a battle
where you just had this massive amount
of disgusting meat everywhere and I know
that sounds absolutely terrible but like
it was so cheesy and fun I just I loved
it so I mean those are my main
influences workout three you know
Dungeon Keeper myth a lot of games from
the late 90s I just absolutely loved
that's awesome late 90s games nothing
wrong with that now one more thing to
ask is you are the bad character in this
game but it's a bad character you can
still be a protagonist what
the antagonists in this game there is an
evil king so I basically when I say evil
is relative because everything in our
game is evil right everything is dark
the world is completely corrupt but you
used to work for this evil king right
and essentially a he was very arrogant
and wanted to live forever so you were
this you know badass alchemist you make
him a vile that will make him live
forever but in order to do so it has a
curse that you have to first die so he
hated that sentence uses death and
basically he throws the vial on your
dead corpse and brings you back to life
so now the super corrupted king is out
there and you're chopped in this world
of not living and not dead so the only
way to bring yourself to the land of the
dead is to exact revenge on this super
evil king so you go do horrible stuff
two guys done horrible stuff to you so
it's just like the super epic battle of
revenge on both parts right that's cool
now one more question what is your
personal favorite part about this game I
absolutely love just the creature
interactions it is a action game it's a
strategy game it's a tactical game like
everything about it is its own identity
and like I've just I've not played a
game like it and I'm not just saying
that because I'm developing it you know
like it really has its its own feel and
its own kind of style to it that not a
lot of our games do and I love that
about it so i think i think it's
basically that it covers so much ground
it the minions interact with you in a
different way than in any other game and
you're just able to do things in this
game that you can't do in other games i
love that that's great to hear we've
noticed a trend and I know I've said
this in other videos but we have
definitely noticed a trend into indie
mega booth that these guys are doing
stuff that's new they're doing stuff
that's innovative like you said he
hasn't played a game like this before
it's probably true he probably hasn't
played a game like this before because
all these guys are driving innovation
and trying new things thank you for
showing us your game if you like next
