Razer Kraken now when you look at the
build quality of these headphones alone
you'll sit there and go wow really it
only costs $300
yes $300 is extremely expensive but what
Razer sought to make with these
headphones was their first truly
audiophile grade headphones so when we
open it up we find a nice little letter
welcoming you to the cult of Razer and
no driver disk because unlike many
high-end headphones from gaming
companies these are not USB which I've
always felt is a real problem with
high-end headphones from gaming
companies is that USB sound cards just
really aren't very good and most audio
files are going to have better solutions
on their own so Razer has gone ahead and
implemented a fully pure analog high-end
$300 headphone here it comes with an
awesome card carrying case that has kind
of a leisure leather ish outer material
to it the individual headphones are hand
assembled you can see that they're not
forgetting their gaming roots here they
do fold up to make them a little bit
more compact in the case and they open
up with a nice little satisfying snap
there they are made out of machined
aircraft-grade aluminum with
animal-friendly leatherette which is
actually among the best leatherette that
i've encountered there's leatherette
that feels like plastic stretched over
foam and then there's leatherette that
actually feels like oh yeah okay if you
weren't telling me that this is leather
I'd have had a much harder time figuring
out that it is there's a supersoft thick
coat of foam on both of the ear pads as
well as on the headband this is
something that just gets overlooked too
much on headphones look at that nice
wide head been because distribution of
weight is important and nice padding on
the underside of it now with that said
when I say distribution of weight I am
NOT talking about a trivial amount of
weight here folks because of the
aluminum construction they are not
particularly lightweight they've got 40
millimeter neodymium drivers in each ear
cup and only 32 ohm impedance so that
means that they'll be usable not only on
your gaming PC with your more advanced
audio solution but also on something
like a smartphone or whatever well
and for that reason razor includes two
cables one that's just a straight vert
well it's K it's a smaller I think this
is a two and a half mil two three and a
half mil two detachable cable and then
the other one which is replaceable with
the other one now this is getting
confusing two cables one that just goes
to three and a half mil for just
headphones on a second that's a 4-pole
so it supports both headphones and
microphone and then finally eraser also
includes a nice little three and a half
mil two quarter inch adapter I mean if I
just told you what they look like then I
wouldn't really be doing my job here
would I so first I adjusted them to my
head which has a very satisfying metal
adjustment mechanism like I said guys
these are built like headphones that
cost several times as much they're
extremely comfortable look at this I'm
going to show you guys a quick demo here
so I'm going to push these in and you're
going to see how much plushness there is
before the things even touch my ears
then I burned them in for about 36 hours
just putting them on the back of a chair
and running my music library on medium
to high volume continuously once they've
been broken in a little bit I fired them
up using an objective 2 amp /o dak combo
unit so that I have a nice reference
audio source and then for my comparison
testing I used my AKG K 701 s my Denon a
HD 600 s my Bayer dynamic DT 770 Pro 80
ohms and my Sennheiser Momentum's which
all cost between 200 to 320 dollars on
Amazon as of today
now guys to be clear I'm a top 40
listener so let's get this out of the
way flax mp3s
some obscure format you rip all your
music - if you listen to pop or that
style of music with upper range male
vocalists or female vocalists and
there's any bass in the song honestly
the clarity is not really there in the
mid-range and is masked by bass that I
just don't feel is tight enough to call
punchy but feels more like what I would
describe as boomy all of this is
especially problematic for me when I
compare them to other sort of bass head
approved products like these Sennheiser
ie 80s that I've been listening to a lot
lately if you don't like IMS of course
you don't like I am so those are
completely off the table but it's just
something I have to think about when I
go well these are also available for
about $300 okay but Razer knew all of
this when they created the product so
just like hammerhead which I did not
find to my tastes this is not aimed at
my tastes when I handed my hammerheads
off to a friend of mine who loves beats
and Skullcandy products and loves lots
of bass he was like yeah these are
awesome because it was a step in the
right direction towards better audio
reproduction but with a sound signature
that he enjoyed so what I did was I
changed gears and asked the audio
subform on - tech tips comm for some
playlists to hopefully let these things
shine I ended up with some electronic
music with heavy bass lines
lots of drums and the like and they
definitely sounded better but any time
vocals came into play they really did
feel like they were being overwhelmed
somewhat enough music though how do they
perform for gaming if you're going to
test a product from a gaming centric
company like razer i guess you'd better
play some games you know what the gaming
experience actually gave me some
significant additional insight into the
way that these headphones were tuned of
course a gamer centric company like
razer if you're buying $300 headphones
from them wants you to have a great
music listening experience but they also
want you to have a great gaming
experience and explosions sound great
gunfire sounds great the gaming
experience on them is great I guess I if
I had a complaint about these headphones
at this point it would be that I wish
razer had created them from the get-go
as a gaming headset and put a proper
microphone on them rather than just
giving us an inline that would have
added for me to the value proposition of
a $300 pair of headphones that really
handles only a certain genre of music
well but handles gaming extremely well I
mean you could make the argument that
most folks spending $300 on headphones
might just be willing to pony up for a
better microphone solution such as a
blue snowball anyway and you would be
able to make a very solid case for that
but with their closed design so that
means that sound doesn't really leak in
from the outside and doesn't really go
out from the inside as well as their
great performance in gaming and great
performance in basing music I just wish
they were being marketed as more of a
gaming headset ok so this is the
conclusion part normally I don't really
talk about pricing much because I you
know it can fluctuate but these are
expensive headphones and headphones
don't really tend to chain
so we're going to factor in that these
are $300 headphones so let's start with
the build quality these are the best
looking and feeling headphones that I
have laid my hands on in anything close
to this kind of a price range I would go
as far as to say that they are the best
you can get for $300 they justify the
premium that razors commanding for them
with that said they're a little bit too
heavy to call the comfort the best but
the comfort is still a very strong point
of this headset and the reality of it is
while the materials are nice and plush
and soft and they're very comfortable to
wear for an extended period of time
they're made of aluminum so there's
nothing you can do about the additional
weight they definitely sound better than
anything else from razors lineup so if
you like the razor sound signature and
you just want more of the same these are
going to be a fantastic choice for you
but on the other hand if you're you know
a discerning audio snob that seeks flat
frequency response curves then I really
think you're going to be sorely
disappointed by these headphones but the
reality of it is you guys knew that
already razor has a characteristic sound
to them so I don't really know why
you're even still watching this video at
this point so guys go ahead like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment if you think
that you know if you're a discerning
audio snob or if you prefer a more bassy
experience and let us know how you feel
about it so I'll know what to tell you
guys in future videos about these sorts
of products and as always don't forget
