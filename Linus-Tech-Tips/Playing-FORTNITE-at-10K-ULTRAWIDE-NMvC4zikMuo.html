a massive success well you might say
that if you measure success purely by
how many views something gets on YouTube
because the usability of that thing who
left a lot to be desired we know so ever
since we first unveiled it we've been
waiting for the right moment and perhaps
more importantly the right hardware to
bring it back to life better than ever
with hopefully a decent actual gaming
experience this time and that day thank
you Jake has arrived
LG sponsored this video and sent over
nine of their flagship curved ultra wide
monitors so all we need to do now then
is uh go see how the old set up has
survived its long slumber here in the
storage unit holy crap this is a
freaking mess I mean the good news is
most of the wiring is still in place but
like even the underside is that dirty
all right so let's get this let's get
this cleaned up for redeployment here
as many many of you pointed out the 4x4
arrangement of monitors in 16k gaming
made the majority of games pretty much
impossible to play because any kind of
crosshair ended up being hidden behind
the bezels right in the middle of our
display array and the abominable frame
rates didn't help either I mean even
though we were running for quadrille p5
thousands one for each of our four rows
of monitors last time and those are
about equivalent to gtx 1080s but with
16 gigs of video memory almost every
game ran into some sort of processing or
memory bottleneck it was just it was
just too many pixels csgo wouldn't even
run fortunately though a couple of
months ago
Nvidia squad row team who launched the
GV 100 a $9,000 beast of a workstation
GPU and they graciously lent us a few of
them so now we're cooking with gas maybe
these puppies have about 2.9 three times
the transistor count so they are much
more powerful and they each come with 32
gigs of high-speed HP m2 memory okay so
first things first we need a system
thank you that is worthy of those
graphics cards so I wanted to use a 70
900 X but the last one we had didn't
survive addy lid so we're using a 79 60
X instead for us first problem I guess
so the clock speeds are a little bit
lower on this one but let's be realistic
here I mean even in this new
configuration every card is still
running the pixel count equivalent of a
5k display so the bottleneck is still
going to be the GPUs and not the CPU for
our motherboard Asus sent over their
rampage
six extreme which is going to be paired
with naturally a hundred and twenty
eight gigs of vengeance RGB ddr4 memory
Wow this receipt is this is getting a
few four zeros on it here then I had
really hoped good thing of course Aaron
ACS graciously provided these things and
then for power the obvious choice was
Corsairs a X 1600 I with some sexy cable
log pro style cables to match our icy
table now cooling is actually
surprisingly not a huge concern since
our desk PC case is quite open for the
GPUs and we're not going to be
overclocking our CPU so we're gonna be
using an NHD 15 now then it's time for
the monitors as I mentioned earlier the
gaming downside of even-numbered monitor
grids easily outweighs any advantage so
a three by three grid looked like our
best option cuz five by five was just
not gonna be a thing but rather than
simply do a 12 K setup which was our
original plan to make the rig somewhat
playable we opted to try something new
so these our LG's 34 you see 99 W these
are 34 40 by 1440 curved IPS Ultra ones
they've got USB type-c input and free
sync and this is cool they run it up to
75 Hertz so any less demanding games we
might be able to get even more than 60
fps and the aesthetic here actually
helps our cause a lot to check this out
even the bottom bezel is not much bigger
than the sides on the top now this is
less of an issue in a standard desktop
configuration but when you start
stacking them it makes a huge difference
quite literally huge and holy that curve
hey there we go this one's over your
scalings a little a little want a stick
there
got that big start button and that small
start why do they all have a start menu
mosaic is not up yet so we need to
configure mosaic okay make it one big
display oh we can play something this is
beautiful
I just love standing right here like the
sound of my voice echoes back at me and
video why you do okay there we go there
we go
and then the last piece of puzzle bezel
correct bezel correction cool yes okay
what we're doing is we're trying to
align the road here that's not bad
actually no it's not even close what
does need like a hundred pixels what do
you mean not even close no that's off
you're too far stop stop stop stop you
can't look at just one of them no it's
not look at them you can look at
whatever one angle it's a little bit too
far on that one but it's not far enough
on a couple oh I see tweak you can do it
per monetize the launders aren't aligned
perfectly yeah like so basically because
Jake done goofed are you just so hyped
to play game yeah too bad
Nvidia says no games these are Quadros
these are not for gaming professionals
have patience the professionals getting
paid to set this up are getting paid by
the hour anyway
what do they care whoo Wow I get to
really drive Jake follow me we broke
another tech accessory out of the
mothballs upstairs this is our oboe
revolution cockpit with a Logitech G 920
racing wheel that is going through it's
a pre-flight calibration here and we've
got a shifter because jake assumes that
i know how to drive manual which i do
yes okay so i stalled I know how to
drive manual how do I restart the car
well
oh my food yeah damn shift don't go down
shift that's okay I'm pretty good at
over I never played over okay it's
basically Team Fortress 2 though okay
like a little different oh yeah oh yes
like 30 hero
oh yeah their button it'll have unique
things whereas oh look at that you got
an endorsement for being a good teammate
right but I have to be on the email I'll
shoot your left shift at though at the
door there my what see if they're gonna
come and kill you oh my god so worth Wow
oh come on it's like you're eat oh you
damn it yeah
this is good at overwatch who knew does
anyone know how to tell if someone's on
my team nobody's on your team your
remember we talked about this oh so this
is like this is like complete
free-for-all
yeah oh you're gonna get you're gonna
get destroyed like oh okay so I just
need to hide right here forever okay
well that's not interesting that's sort
of left I guess gasps all the way low
alright whatever this doesn't run that
well so let's try something else
look at that this is 75 so there I want
to try a hundred Hertz but he's gorgeous
alright okay do we have anything else to
try can it run crisis law okay what
graphics settings are we at whoo oh that
low that's a suspect low that texture
low we're not even trying to like run it
well then hey alright
we're at 48 fps and we haven't even
actually rendered anything other than a
black screen with some green text on it
yet this game games very optimized okay
we are at seven yes wow he looks nice
here does that look like all your Garmin
so it's just the other character models
that get completely you're gonna stroke
but your hump your hand is like high
quality I don't know oh wait what just
happened there how did I not fall down
it's like first it
are you going oh my goodness isn't this
where I'm supposed to go oh we're done
okay as much as we love using enterprise
grade hardware for unconventional things
like gaming Nvidia did ask us very
nicely to talk about what these cards
are actually made for so have you ever
seen the multi hundred foot video walls
in places like Times Square or in Tokyo
or while watching your favorite sports
teams live well they're usually made up
of many smaller displays like our set up
here and even though they're intended to
be viewed from far away so their pixel
density is comparatively low like all of
these look great from even just a couple
feet away their overall resolution can
get very high along with their demand
for video memory and processing power
and of course the images all need to be
synchronized even if you're just playing
back video so the sync card would come
in handy there and for a more apples to
apples look at the processing power
improvements because gaming at different
resolutions it doesn't really mean
anything
we try to Chronos as v-ray ray-tracing
benchmark and found that it actually
runs in half the time compared to our
last set up and bear in mind guys we are
running one fewer actual graphics card
in this setup so that's pretty much it
now we just got to pack this thing up
and take it to LTX yeah so huge huge
thank you to LG for making this project
happen if you guys like what you saw
from these monitors you can pick one up
or 9:00 at the link in the video
description or if you want even more
pixels stay tuned because LG is
launching their new 5k ultra wide nano
IPS display soon so you can check out
the link to that or just google LG ultra
wide for more information on their
latest ultra wide displays thanks for
watching guys if you disliked then you
clearly hate technology but if you liked
hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link below also
down there's our merch
which has cool shirts like this one and
our community forum which you should
definitely join how's it going there
not great all right in bastion we just
can't oh did I get more kill some you oh
yeah yeah
look my team won a limb is gold I chose
while my team is playing right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
