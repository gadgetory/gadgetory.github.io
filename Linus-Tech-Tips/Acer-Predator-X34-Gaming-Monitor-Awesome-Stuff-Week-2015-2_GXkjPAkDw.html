sponsor entry to awesome stuff week 2015
and and this keeps freaking happening to
me I am always declaring some new
monitor to be the best thing ever
compared to other 3d monitors that I've
seen this is hands-down the one to get
it might just be the best I've ever seen
only the lack of JPEGs prevents this
from winning my coveted Editors Choice
Award the only choice for someone who
wants all about 4k is off my wish list
and large format for one by nine is on
it my new top choice for a Productivity
minded workstation display in the XR
3501 is my new top dog gaming monitor
and then someone be it a sous LG Acer
BenQ whoever keeps standing up and being
like um excuse me
ours has a high refresh rate or like
ours is IPS or ours is bigger or ours is
curved fool well today it's finally over
because the x34 predator is here from
Acer bringing perhaps an end to my quest
for the perfect monitor let's find out
if it succeeds shall we
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more physically it
seems like whether it's through careful
market research or pure trial and error
acer has improved a lot in terms of
their performance II looking industrial
design because the x34 predator manages
in my mind to look gamer II without
crossing the line to tacky starting at
the back I do wish that the entire
industry would lose the infatuation with
glossy surfaces but there's an optional
base amount adapter and the tilt and
height adjustable stand has these kind
of sharp angles and lines to it and with
only a tiny orange accent on the cable
management pass-through to reveal that
it's a gaming monitor the bezels are as
slim as they can be while keeping that
required chin bar to house electronics
and even the front logo issues a
brightly colored affair in favor of a
monochrome one with a subtle orange
backing material but enough about how it
looks on a shelf let's talk specs and
see if the x34 predator ticks all the
right boxes 34 inch curved display okay
not as curved and therefore immersive
feeling as the Ben qxr 3501 but better
than flat IMO check eh IPS panel
technology for superior color
performance and viewing angles big check
34 40 by 1440 resolution much more
difficult to drive than 2560 by 1080
more on that later but a much finer
image and way better for regular desktop
use check again so that sounds great so
far Linus but hold on a second none of
this is anything we haven't seen before
in fact what the hell is the difference
between this and the XR 341 CK that you
reviewed literally two months ago great
question and here's the answer the
things that set the x34 predator apart
from anything else that I've ever seen
is that in addition to all of that
it features g-sync technology which you
can learn more about here but basically
it eliminates stutter and screen tearing
during game rendering on supported
GeForce graphics cards and
it can be overclocked from its stalks
60-hertz refresh rate to a whopping 100
Hertz for a very noticeable improvement
in how frequently updated frames can be
delivered to the gamers eyes so that's
it acer has officially delivered
everything that I've been asking for
since first laying eyes on an ultra wide
one and a half years ago everything else
at this point is just gravy which isn't
to say that gravy is bad revisiting the
rear of the monitor we've got a bit of
an unusual i/o layout there's a four
port USB 3 hub power input for the
external brick an audio pass-through
that maybe someday a monitor
manufacturer will put somewhere usable
and what's this ah perhaps some gravy
Acer has implemented not only the
standard DisplayPort 1.2 that's been
required for g-sync operations since the
technology was first introduced but also
an HDMI input that along with the 100
Hertz refresh rate capability of the
display suggests that the predator is
running something more than just the
original g-sync module the secondary
input is limited to 50 Hertz by default
indicating that to my disappointment it
is an HDMI 1.4 rather than HDMI 2.0 port
but it's redeemed somewhat by my
successful overclock to 60 Hertz on a
gtx 980ti and it's still a heck of a lot
better than nothing if you have a
secondary PC or a console that you want
to plug into your main monitor
periodically and speaking of display
overclocking how does that 100 Hertz
overclock work
well actually the process was too
straightforward for me and I got
confused I should probably explain that
people who are familiar with display
overclocking know that it's done through
the graphics card control panel not the
monitors on-screen menu well not on this
bad boy to achieve the advertised up to
100 Hertz overclock you just navigate to
it in the menu confirm a reboot of the
monitor and configure your shiny new
refresh rate in Windows the same way
that you normally would which of course
instantly made me curious to see if it
could be pushed even further using the
Nvidia control panel
and no not even one Hertz Acer has
already put their balls to the wall so
to speak 100 Hertz is all you get so
then let's change gears and talk about
what it's like gaming on my ultimate
monitor well to put it succinctly it's
super awesome but that doesn't really
get my point across properly I mean I
guess it's just hard for me to deliver
that amped up you know like yeah yeah
I'd like skin Rox speech here because
for me none of this is a surprise I've
experienced g-sync I've experienced high
refresh rate and I've experienced curved
ultra-wide I've just been patiently
somewhat patiently waiting for someone
to put them all together so the
experience here is more akin to getting
home sitting down after a long day and
taking that first bite of my wife's
amazing homemade pizza than it is to
ripping open a surprise present on
Christmas morning this is a deeply
satisfying amazing gaming experience and
everything from racing to shooters to
third-person to anything it's the bomb
which doesn't mean I'm not going to try
and find problems with this monitor
starting with input lag testing the x34
predator managed a mere 13.7
milliseconds with my Leo Bodnar input
lag tester so that won't be an issue and
picking up with panel color performance
well damn when did gaming monitors get
so good at this I mean no it's not
perfect but at 98% coverage of srgb and
color accuracy falling in the Delta II
of 2 to 4 range pretty much across the
board this monitor of gaming aside is
even suitable for prosumer photo and
video editing in the bog standard
default user mode without any
calibration
hot-diggity there's a touch of backlight
bleed on a black background but nothing
out of the ordinary and I feel like the
anti-glare coating while not the most
glare reducing I've ever encountered
strikes a good balance between the
clarity of the image and the reduction
of reflections so then my only real
complaints that I can find are in the
on-screen menu the monitor
ax√© any ultra-low motion blur settings
for controlling back light strobing
something that I don't personally use
because it can't be used at the same
time as g-sync right now which I prefer
but it's been a staple on modern g-sync
monitors for quite some time so it's
disappointing that it's not there
and my second complaint the on screen
menu is just generally really clunky to
navigate it's hard to tell what button
you're pressing and it takes forever to
get anything done but I guess that's
about oh no there's one more thing the
price the x34 predator may be amazing
but it comes in at a whopping
$1,300 u.s. MSRP not to mention that
because it runs at such a high
resolution that to even benefit from its
hundred Hertz refresh rate you are going
to need some serious graphics and CPU
horsepower for modern triple-a games at
high settings but if you're a baller I
can say with confidence this is the best
gaming experience you can put on your
desk and here's a cool side note if
you're a baller
thanks to this video's inclusion in
awesome stuff week 2015 there should
actually be a new ad unit on it that
YouTube is testing that allows you to
see where to buy it from right within
the video for most of us this is
probably a non-factor but if you've got
a couple grand burning a hole in your
pocket then I guess it saves your mouse
and keyboard a little wear and tear and
on that subject mass drop you guys might
have heard of mass drop before or you
might not have but if you do want to
check it out it's draw ups slash Linus
tech tips and they've got all kinds of
great stuff whether you're looking for
like a cool new knife or an audio
recorder a pair of headphones a keyboard
they've got all kinds of great stuff and
the way it works is simple the community
gets together and says hey we've got
this amazing thing that we want to buy
but it's a little expensive mass drop
takes those requests back to the
manufacturers and distributors and gets
authentic products that the more people
commit to buy the more mass the lower
the price drops for when they all go
ahead and pay at the end of the draw
up and ship out to everyone very cool
model and it is definitely worth
shopping if you got a couple bucks and
you don't mind finding something cool
and spending it because I have certainly
fallen into that trap before like oh
this is cool oh that's really cool no
way that's the drop price done so check
them out at draught ups slash Linus tech
tips and that is linked in the video
