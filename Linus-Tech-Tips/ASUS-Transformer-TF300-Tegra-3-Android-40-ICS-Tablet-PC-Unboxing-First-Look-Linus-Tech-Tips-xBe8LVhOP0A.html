Transformer Pad TF 300 I know I'm a
little bit late to the punch on this
particular unboxing but I think you guys
will find that it is worth the wait
because the TF 300 is pretty boss so
there's not a whole lot that a suit this
is this is not a new unit by the way
guys we're just gonna and we're gonna
pretend that it's new by me making it
look more new see there we go now it
sort of looks like you know not like 18
five-year old ball sort of we're
touching it
there we go so there's not a whole lot
that a suit says about the unit on the
package powered by nvidia tegra this is
critical HDMI okay cool nothing and very
simplistic packaging is shows the
different bat colors so there's red blue
and silver and this one is apparently a
blue one so we'll verify that in a
moment
so the Tegra part is key because the TF
300 basically is attempting to achieve
almost the same performance as the
transformer prime which was the update
to the original transformer which was
with the Tegra 2 processor however it
does so without some of the extra fluff
that doesn't add performance so the TF
300 for example forgoes the metal back
that had the same concentric circle
pattern and instead replaces it with a
plastic back the end result I don't know
if you guys to remember if you've
watched my transformer prime unboxing
and first look but the end result is
actually quite nice I personally prefer
tablets with a plastic back to those
with the metal back for a couple of
reasons number one is fingerprints
fingerprints are pretty much impossible
to remove from an aluminum back to
device and a lot of the time they will
stain over time so the back of the
device we'll just look grubby no matter
what and then number two is in terms of
comfort these are can hear that these
circles are slightly ribbed so what that
means is when you're holding on to it
with your fingers and the
cool thing about the circles is no
matter where you're holding on to it
it'll always be exactly against the
grain of your fingers so you actually
get a little bit of grip a little bit of
resistance to your fingers slipping from
the plastic back I personally prefer it
it does have a little bit of weight and
it does add a touch of thickness about a
millimeter if I recall correctly to the
transformer prime spec so you got like
your eighties logo your ID back mounted
camera you got your speaker going on
here let's have a look at the overall
sort of i/o and let me just see if I can
figure out how to turn it on give me a
sec guys so while we wait for it to
build up a base charge we might as well
have a look at the the outside of the
unit so we already showed the rear
camera so that's an 8 megapixel camera
up here is the microphone pinhole and
the power button and that's pretty much
it for the top so it's very clean
looking moving around to the side we've
got a volume rocker switch micro HTML
micro sd as well as a hard reset button
so that's handy to have because even the
best OS locks up once in a while and
that that's something that I've really
felt is missing from other tablet
products that exist so here's our three
2.5 millimeter headphone jack and that's
it for this side on the bottom we find
the power dot connector as well as a
couple of clips for the optional
keyboard accessories so just like the
previous generation TF 101 as well as
the prime it has an optional keyboard
that you can plug it into which gives
you additional i/o additional battery
life as well as a full keyboard so the
less things that I met so far were the
front camera as well as the ambient
light sensor so that's gonna give you
access to things like automatic screen
brightness and and whatnot that way it
knows how how bright everything is I
think that's pretty much it for the
outside of the unit so until it turns on
we're gonna have to hold off for now
alright guys so we've got it booted up
now it only took about it took about an
hour to get enough of a charge I think
it was just because it was really dead
because it was a
they had it running like right down to
the very end so it's got a boat yeah
it's got about a 50% charge after only
about an hour of charging so it's good
to go
so the 1280 by 800 IPS screen is you
know it's it's not quite the brilliance
and vibrance of the one on the prime the
prime is an IPS plus screen whereas this
is an IPS screen however it is still
really good so I'd say before you see
any kind of an issue with brightness or
color I'm able to turn it to about here
and then to about here so that gives you
some idea of the angle if you're using
your tablet from this angle you are
probably doing it wrong anyway so so
that kind of thing is not that big of a
concern for me so it uses a slightly
downgraded GPU but the same CPU as the
prime so what that means is in terms of
snappiness responsiveness the Tegra 3
processor in this one is going to give
you that long you can clearly see that
responsiveness that response to that
snap unfortunately our Wi-Fi is down in
the tech tips room right now so I'm not
going to be able to show you guys that
particular actually give me a sec guys
for products like this other than the
build quality as well as basically the
build quality as well as the features it
comes down a lot of the time to include
software as well so they include a
note-taking software as well as a
polaris office suite as well as asus is
my cloud so my cloud allows you to own
look at this got a little introduction
what does my cloud do it allows you to
carry around music videos and documents
in the cloud so you don't actually have
to physically throw them on the device
but you can still access them as long as
you have an internet connection so that
gives you a ton of flexibility it's
available in 16 gig and 32 gig
capacities which means you can store up
to that much on the device itself it's
got a microSD slot so you can store up
to that much more again on the device
itself plus you've got your cloud as a
place to store things that like
documents for example that you never
know where you're going to need them
from exactly and it's really handy to
have them when you need them so right
let's do a little bit about Tegra 3 cuz
I haven't talked about it for a while so
Tegra 3 uses 4 plus 1 CPU cores so it
has
for performance CPU cores and then one
low-power CPU core so when I'm doing
nothing when I'm sitting here like this
that low-power CPU core is keeping the
power consumption of the device at a
bare minimum so performance while I'm
doing nothing might be less which is
fine because it's not doing anything and
as soon as I try to do something as soon
as I launch a demanding app it will kick
in as many of those other cores as much
as is needed in order to give me the
performance that I need on demand now
while I did say that the the transport
the something 30l sorry the GPU in here
is slightly let the t30 elf is slightly
less powerful than the one in the
transformer prime the t30 it is still
about thirty percent faster than the
Tegra 2 GPU so you're still going to be
able to run any games even H with HDMI
out to to a TV or to a projector or
whatever else you want you're going to
be able to run any games that you could
run on your Tegra 2 device even smoother
than what you can do on here so thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at the masseuse oh right now
I forgot about there right right they
completely re-engineered the sound
solution on this one so one of my
complaints about most tablets is that
the sound is tinny and and awful so they
had their sound team work on their
stereo solution which is two small
speakers but behind this one grill here
that a sleuth claims is actually
significantly better in terms of audio
quality and accuracy compared to
previous generation products so that is
pretty darn cool so even though our
Wi-Fi is down I decided to just feather
my phone so that we can quickly show you
guys the browsing and overall
responsiveness of the machine now bear
in mind yes the internet speed is not
what it would be because not only are we
running off of 3G but we're running off
of terrible 3G because there's so much
interference in the tech tips room that
almost nothing I'm not I'm gonna come
back sorry that almost nothing runs
correctly in here when it comes to
wireless so I'm just gonna put my phone
here which gives me like an additional
two bars of reception
and hopefully that'll be what we need in
order to get this to actually function
here so a soos let's go to the soos
global site yeah that's right oh look at
that so if you've used a tag or two
tablet you guys know that that is a lot
smoother the Tegra 3 processor just
blows away the Tegra 2 when it comes to
responsiveness I mean little little
things you can tell almost immediately
when you sit down and use a tablet how
fast it is how responsive it is how
usable it is well one of my personal
favorite benchmarks is going to the
YouTube non mobile site youtube.com and
then trying to read comments because it
just destroys my iPad 2 as well as my
Galaxy Tab 10.1 so where is it desktop
site so let's see how the Tegra 3
processor handles it like I can barely
even scroll on a video and read comments
it's just brutal browser so fast though
remember guys I'm running on 3G right
now
oh I don't want it to be trying to load
a video in the background and oh yeah I
never even mentioned it but this is ice
cream sandwich of course so the latest
google OS so you can see there's still a
little bit of delay but it's actually
way way better than Tegra 2 so Tegra 2
I'll like swipe and then I'll do like
three steamboats in the middle go for me
it's it can be very very slow times
especially if there's a lot of comments
so you can see even this one is is
dragging a little bit so there you go
blah blah blah the zooming and all that
stuff looks really good screen looks
really sharp actually oh it looks
fantastic
I have it out full brightness right now
as well mmm I missed
there we go screen accuracy feels pretty
good as well that's the first miss I've
had in terms of clicking so we're at at
least sort of 95 percent which is about
all I all I really expect well someone
