this is the heat 77 X which as you guys
might imagine uses the z77 chipset from
Intel ud5 HUD implies that there is
ultra durable technology but wait it's
not ultra durable five because that's
not out yet the highest ultra durable we
have is ultra durable four and this one
has it so moving along we've got their
3d bios logo here which includes the
dual UEFI bios with their unique
graphical interface that allows you to
actually click on the various parts of
your board in order to access them so
you want to access things about to say
the parts you just click on the SATA
ports a bit more intuitive then you know
shoot where do they usually keep that
see I can't even remember where they
usually keep the same options because
all over the place it can be in like
integrated peripherals sometimes what
does that even mean integrated
peripheral SATA port anyway so gigabyte
wants to make that simpler it also
includes 3d power which is they're all
digital engine meaning they are using
all digital PWM for this particular
motherboard this supports the latest
Intel Core i7 third generation
processors on the 1155 socket z77 chips
that we covered PCI Express gen3 is
supported by this board so you want to
run your latest gtx 680 i guess by the
time you watch this video might not be
the latest plus 680 or radeon HD 7970
and get the absolute most out of it yes
the extra 1% or so PCI Express gen3
is the way to go it's more important for
SLI or crossfire though and I'll cover
that more later the M SATA connector is
on board which I'll cover more once
we've opened it up and ultra-durable 4
so this is a bunch of stuff high
temperature protection humidity
protection using their new woven glass
fiber or sorry woven glass fabric PCB
which can be relevant if you are in a
high humidity environment such as say
for example Taiwan or I mean you know
I've had situations where I've
accidentally spilled water on a board I
hope it would help with that although
you know no promises there guys
electrostatic protection so they've
integrated circuitry that actually
protects the board from being damaged in
the event of an electrostatic accident
and power failure protection once again
design choices that they've made to help
to get the risk of that permanently
damaging your motherboard so we'll leave
that there so that we don't miss
anything okay
and let's open this bad boy up so the
motherboard comes first but I'm gonna
make you guys wait for it
and we'll go through the exit no no no
calm down slick will do the motherboard
later I'm gonna go through the
accessories first so we have two right
angles data cables one right angle
catered SATA cable and a straight SATA
cable so three right angles and one
straight then we have a USB 3.0 front
panel three and a half inch Bay user
manual as well as driver and utility DVD
don't use this download the latest from
D gigabyte website there's also huh look
at that they they opened it up to the
page with the box contents and the
motherboard layout see those are the
little touches that you gotta appreciate
gigabyte sticker multilingual
installation guide book with more
languages than I can speak we have a
flexible black SLI bridge it's the very
best kind we also have an i/o plate that
is handily color-coded love color coding
love things that are black and love
small finishing touches so far gigabyte
a plus as far as the included
accessories are going next let's get the
board opened up here this is a reseal
board it's a sample board so yeah yours
won't look like that unless you buy this
one
haha no just kidding you won't get this
one here we go so you know what let's
shift our angle a little bit here
I meant turn the camera off and we're
ready all right so at the very center of
the board the very focal point for me is
the new well not new LGA 1155 socket
supporting the new Ivy Bridge codenamed
intel core i7 and i-5 and i3 generation
3 processors the thing we also find
right next to it is another cool Intel
technology that is Intel Smart Response
technology you can throw a little PCIe
SSD in here not going to take up any of
your PCI slots or any of your SATA ports
and you can use that to run Intel srt
caching off of a drive that you have
connected to the system very very cool
alright we've got our power delivery
delivery circuitry here along with beefy
heat sinks that are connected by a heat
pipe to the beacon you'd think that is
also installed on the chipset itself we
have our 8 pin connector in its ideal
location at the top left of the board
and we'll go around and count the PWM
fan headers at the end of the video
this right here is dual channel ddr3
memory supporting up to 4 dims that so
that is a chipset thing guys this is not
a replacement for x79 this is a
replacement for z68 so we still see dual
channel ddr3 we have a c MOS switch as
well as a reset switch and a power
button built into the most sensible
possible location up here at the top
right of the board now this is axel if
this excellent this is only AUD 5 level
board so this isn't even a top end board
but look at this it's got all of your
voltage check points that's that's like
outstanding I cannot stress enough how
outstanding that is you can check all
your voltages with a multimeter even on
this like sort of high-end but not quite
like AUD 7 or or a g1 series board very
cool the 24 pin connectors and it's
ideal location along the far right of
the board and check this out if you want
additional power for your graphics cards
you can use a SATA connector instead of
a molex and I think this is a great
design choice and I yea appreciate that
as you
all right here we go SATA to port will
be disabled when
mSATA slot is in use so there you go it
is running off of the okay so you do use
up a port but I guess you get the
benefit of it like it looking badass and
you don't have to use up an actual day
in your case so there there's the
benefit all right these guys right here
are SATA 3 6 gigabit per second these
ones right here are stated to three
gigabit per second and these ones are
also oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
these four are SATA 2 6 3 gigabit per
second and then these four are SATA 3 6
gigabit per second this one is also say
2 3 6 gigabit per second and check this
out 2 front panel USB 3.0 ports so this
is interesting because according to the
Intel 3 front panel USB 3.0 ports this
is interesting because according to the
Intel spec the front panel USB 3 port
like the Intel the Intel USB 3 ports
have to be integrated with two in the
front two in the back so on this
particular board you're gonna be allowed
to choose whether you want to run off of
the Intel USB 3 chip or off of the
third-party USB 3 chip we have another
SATA 3 port I think I mentioned that and
here are all of our front panel switches
front USB with extra power for faster
charging front panel USB 2 with not
extra power for charging we have our TPM
slot as well as front firewire and front
audio gigabyte has started putting front
audio at the bottom of the board kudos
gigabyte it used to be here and this is
better alright having a look at the back
of the board so the z77 chipset supports
onboard video on supported Intel Core I
whatever you know processors that do
have onboard video all the Ivy Bridge
ones do so we've got VGA DVI HDMI and
DisplayPort so the full gamut of options
and what's cool is that with lucid virtu
MVP
we actually get a lot more options in
terms of a how to connect your monitor
because you can connect it either to the
discrete graphics card or the onboard
graphics card and you can choose V mode
or AI mode whether you whichever one is
connected to it doesn't matter also you
can use okay assuming the game supports
it it comes down to software support
again assuming that the game supports it
you can use virtue MVP to actually
dramatically improve the performance of
the discrete graphics card by having the
onboard GPU handle basic tasks and
leaving the more complicated things such
as tessellation to your DirectX 11
graphics card interesting paint all
right moving on we've got optical audio
out two USB 2.0 ports an additional USB
2.0 port okay
firewire four USB 3.0 ports the two of
these are off the Intel chipset two of
them are off a third party chipset two
Gigabit Ethernet ports and 7.1 audio so
right I said I was going to go back and
count all the PWM fan headers so here we
go one two
don't come in too close so that they can
see where they are I think one two three
four five uh five PWM fan headers so
don't forget oh oh right right right
right right sorry I almost forgot so
it's also got integrated creative
soundblaster x-fi mb2 audio which has a
built-in headphone amplifier so this is
not quite as advanced to the scientists
they've used on the past on their g1
motherboards but it's going to be a heck
of a lot better than your standard
onboard audio and then what else are we
missing here hold on let me just make
sure I didn't miss anything guys Intel
Gigabit Ethernet right yes one of these
two built-in lens is Intel so as opposed
to a third-party chipset which a lot of
users do prefer
and finally you know what let's go back
to the back of the box where they do
have some of their other stuff sorry
guys this is in lieu of notes so that
outline actually yeah you guys can just
look at that if you really want to that
outlines the benefits of ultra-durable
for which has continued to bring you
know the same standard things like two
ounce copper BCD which is for better
heat dissipation as well as less
interference along with a whole bunch of
other cool stuff so I think that pretty
much covers it thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the g77 execute e5h
and don't forget to subscribe to Linus
Texas for unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and don't forget you can
always benefit from all digital power
that is the CPU the VTT the memory and
the Intel HD graphics which are all
digitally powered yes the slot layout
sorry guys I forgot three PCIe 1x slots
- PCIe 16x lala okay three PCIe 16x
slots but more on that in a minute
and one PCI slots so I mentioned that
PCIe three support was going to be
important for an SLI or crossfire users
on this platform that is because these
are not both full 16x it's 16 X or 8 X 8
X if you have two cards in them as per
the same limitations as the z68 platform
its z68 right yeah Wow dirt moment there
guys uh-huh right
so remember pcie 3.0 8 X is the same
bandwidth as PCIe 16x 2.0 so that means
that if you're running PCIe 3 on your
cpu remember you need a PCIe III CPU as
well as your graphics parts that 8 X
bandwidth is going to be the same as
last generation 16 X so there should be
no performance bottleneck there at all
finally this PCIe 4x lock requires an
Ivy Bridge third gen CPU for more
information please refer to the user
manual so there you go 16 X 60 r88 or +
4 X assuming you're using an Ivy Bridge
CPU</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
