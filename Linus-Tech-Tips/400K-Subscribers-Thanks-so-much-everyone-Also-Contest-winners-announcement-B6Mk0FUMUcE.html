winners of the giveaways so we're going
to start with the 900d giveaway this was
sponsored by Timmy tech TV you should
check out Timmy tech TV on youtube
hopefully we'll do an overlay for this
or something like that but youtube.com
slash Timmy tech TV he contributed a
900d to our forum community and it was
won by none other than so Pete oh so
soapy toad get in touch with Timmy
through YouTube private messages to
collect your prize including having it
shipped to you so that one was us only
however now we open up into 'don't danta
the big giveaway so first up is the WD
computex giveaway this was sponsored by
western digital and steger dynamics
basically WD asked hey get your viewers
to watch as much of your computex
coverage of the western digital booth as
possible and we'll give you a whack ton
of stuff to give away to them so we did
not really hit any of the targets WD
gave us however there were four tiers of
prizes and they honored three of the
tears so that means we're giving away a
bunch of internal drives a bunch of
external drives and to full-blown gaming
systems from huge it systems so lets you
can check out the full details of the WD
computex giveaway in the giveaway winner
list thread within the linus tech tips
forum will also link to that in the
video description so here we go my
passport ultra winner sigh Andre merius
nortec play leet and you better not my
book studio winners are kitten ignition

kitten ignition one terabyte
velociraptor winners are wild turtle and
and corian chi and then 3 terabyte WD
red winners remember these are optimized

four terabyte WD black winners remember
these are very high performance drives
our new music and Jonah 873 the to puget
systems winners are these are the
biggest prizes we have to give away here
guys these are core i5 systems the gtx
660 s marine and rash danville good job
guys y'all are
our winners if you were a winner you've
probably been private message through
the forum if you are a winner and for
whatever reason you believe you have not
been contacted do reach out to slick
about claiming your prize all fake
claims will be completely ignored
because it's pointless yeah I've had
people try I really have like like a
slight variation of the youtube name and
then sending me a private message hey
you said I won but i didn't get
contacted yeah i know you didn't win
alright so the HTC phone giveaway we had
four phones to give away the full
details are in the thread that is linked
here you actually get to pick your phone
and anything but an HTC One pretty much
so there's quite a few recent generation
phones our winners are I coils aik oels
Joel the zombie 15 Brad's coolio and
Jose 7 1-3 so congratulations you guys
remember the best way to win these
contests that we run is to not only post
in the forum but also share on facebook
share on twitter and i believe we often
give a 4.4 sharing on an additional
platform and that gives you at the end
of it four times the chance to win
compared to if you only post in the
forum so we saw quite a few of the
winners were the ones who shared because
the way that we pick the winners is by
dumping the names as well as the weight
of their entry into a randomizer and
then pulling out one of the winners so
effectively you get more entries into
the pool by getting more points for the
entry so thanks everyone for
participating huge thanks to our
sponsors western digital HTC as well as
timmy tech TV for allowing us to do this
giveaway and until the next one guys um
sayonara adios bon voyage à bientôt

cheating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
