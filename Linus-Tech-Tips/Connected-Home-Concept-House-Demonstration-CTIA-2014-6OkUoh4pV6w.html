brought to you by AT&amp;amp;T alright guys
welcome to the AT&amp;amp;T booth or we are
currently checking out 18 t digital life
the idea behind digital life is home
automation and home security so
essentially you're you should be able to
alarm your house remotely away from home
let's say you leave home you can alarm
your house from the car make sure all
the lights are turned off and all the
doors are locked then you come home the
home should know that you just arrived
in your connected car it should disarm
the house unlock all the doors open the
garage door for you maybe start playing
some music turn the lights on start
coffee depending on what time it is that
you come home all those kind of small
mundane tasks that you realistically
shouldn't have to do yourself in the
connected future another kind of cool
example that I personally appreciate is
the master bedroom private time mode
where if you close the door on the
master bedroom this is of course
programmed by yourself in their app if
you close it on the master bedroom it
will then automatically lock that door
will automatically alarm the house maybe
turn the lights off in the house start
playing some nice smooth sensual jazz
music and maybe dim the lights above the
bed so you can have some cool little
adult time with your significant other
other things that it can do is say a
sense of water leak under your sink so
if you and your significant other are
away at work and maybe the kids are at
school or something like that and
there's a leak under your tap it can
detect that and turn the top off with a
valve cool functionality and they have
everything ranging from touch sensors to
camera motion sensors and everything
like that available in their app so you
can set up run programs so you can say
run that master bedroom program I was
just talking about remotely from
anywhere or just automatically through
the rim and you can kind of monitor
different rooms so if you have a camera
that watches say the patio you could set
up the patio as a room and you could
have different you could see all the
different sensors that are in the patio
the camera that's on the patio all of
that in a customizable dashboard within
their app very cool functionality to
talk about how the connected home and
the connected car can work together I
had an awesome conversation with Ralph
de la Vega if you think about it today
you leave your home you have a voicemail
system in the home and I voice command
in the home you have a different one in
the car you have a different one you get
to work with AT&amp;amp;T Drive we're trying to
put all those things together so have
the same voice command set
in the car and in the office to make it
easier for everyone to interact with
their homes with their cars and
everything in between
