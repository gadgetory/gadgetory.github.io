you by D brand check them out at the
link in the video description so they
tricked us out of the regular filming
area but there was no way I was going to
leave the Dell booth whatever you call
this thing without covering the XPS 13
to in one so if you guys are looking at
it going gee that looks an awful lot
like the regular XPS 13 then that would
be definitely intentional so still here
are the Infinity bezels so the super
slim bezels still here is the aluminum
and carbon fiber construction and still
here is the light portable feel and the
very good keyboard and build quality
especially considering the size of this
device I'm just going to manhandle it a
little bit here but they had to make a
lot more changes than you would probably
think in order to get a two-in-one hinge
in it so you get your laptop mode you
get to put it down like this mode you
get your tablet mode in order to do that
they had to make the device thinner so
they were able to save some space by
going from a u series processor to a Y
series processor do we lose some
performance yes however a Y series
processor is a 5 watt processor in
Della's using some voodoo magic to run
it at 7 watts pretty much all of the
time with no active cooling whatsoever
so they save some additional space
inside for that they also did reduce the
battery size a little bit but they see
this as a product for a different
consumer and that's why both products
are going to stay in the lineup together
another cool fun fact is while your
plugged in it can actually boost up to 9
watts for minutes at a time closing the
performance gap further it's available
with up to 16 gigs of RAM and up to a
one terabyte SSD and in terms of i/o I
think they found a pretty good balance
you get a Thunderbolt port on the left
that can also be used for charging with
a headphone and microphone jack as well
as their trademark battery life
indicator and then on the right side you
don't get another Thunderbolt they would
have needed another controller for that
but you get a type C and you get a
microSD slot which is great for content
creators since you can easily adapt a
microSD up to a full size SD for your
camera if you're into that sort of thing
they include a CTA adapter in the box in
case you just want to plug in a mouse
and that's all you really need and
they've made some other tweaks that I
really like as well so 1080p screen or
1800 P personally I'd go for the 1080
for the extra little bit of battery life
and they've moved the camera which
supports Windows hello just like
freaking awesome like hello all other
manufacturers can you guys all please
start doing this because it's freaking
sick they moved it from the bottom left
to the center so you don't look
off-kilter
when you're on a conference call or
whatever else speaking of conference
calls it's kind of a business oriented
skew they've got a fingerprint reader
and dedicated page up page down keys
which I'm told is important though I
personally am not a huge fan of that
everything else pretty much I like about
it so let me know in the comments you
guys want to see a full review of this
puppy I want to hear from you guys and
thanks for watching don't forget to
subscribe and a huge thanks to D brand
for allowing us to be here at CES 2017
if you guys like your device you
probably like the idea of throwing a D
brand skin on it whether it's marble
carbon fiber you know matte finish color
you can use their configurator hell yeah
you can even do this if you're me they
don't actually carry this color anymore
but you can use their configurator to
see what your device will look like
makes it look cool protects it from
scotts and scratches they do support
some of the XPS lineup so that's a
pretty cool thing right there and for a
limited time only they're offering $1
worldwide shipping so check that out if
