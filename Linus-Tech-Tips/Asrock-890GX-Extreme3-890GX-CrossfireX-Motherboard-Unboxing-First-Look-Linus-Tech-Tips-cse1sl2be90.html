for mass rocket as part of their true
three three three series I'm not sure
who they got that marketing thing from
but they mean USB 3.0 SATA 3 and eSATA
three this is the 890 GX Xtreme so it's
part of AMD's latest 800 series chipsets
that means it is six core CPU ready
phantom 2 x6 Athlon to Windows 7
crossfire X and integrated Radeon HD
4290 graphics are some of the some of
the technologies included they also have
support for true Blu ray as well as
unlock core unlocking they use Japanese
made long life capacitors and they also
have eup which is less than 1 watt and
off mode very cool so it's an energy
savings feature let's move around to the
back where we have ok they basically
reiterate most of what they said on the
front already awesome so let's get this
board open first thing we find inside in
terms of accessories is the guide to
their instant boot application ok I'm a
cold spot like that it comes in six
different languages then we have a
little a little pamphlet on there
intelligent energy saver so this is a
little application that shows you looks
like how much power your systems pulling
how many power phases are enabled very
neat ok and then ok here we go so we've
got included 1 2 3 4 included SATA 2
cables then we have an i/o shield which
is color coded for your convenience then
we have one molex to SATA power adaptor
and one eSATA bracket very cool then we
have a user's manual which includes a
drivers and utilities DVD don't use this
download the latest this is all English
holy cow this is oh no it's not oh good
ok the language is changed because I was
gonna say this thing's like a novel so
the manual shows you all the basics
where to plug in your front panel
connectors a little oh color picture
guide to the motherboard that's very
nice I don't think I've seen a color
photo inside a motherboard manual before
something every day you know you
encounter for the first time alright
itself is not sealed
let's pull this baby up now as rocks a
bit of a value brand but a lot of the
time that doesn't prevent them from
bringing a product to market at a value
price with all of the high-end features
so let's have a look at what they've got
included here they've got a typical am-3
socket with support for a dual channel
ddr3 memory up to 16 gigs at this time
there are eight pin power connectors and
it's ideal location up at the top left
and then I've actually had questions
about what makes it an ideal location
the reason is that that's the easiest
place to route up behind the motherboard
tray most of the time and then there 24
pin power connector is also in its ideal
location along the right-hand edge down
here we're going to find the Southbridge
cooler is kind of a just at our fin
cooler a very standard affair but it's
going to do a good job you can tell just
looking at it you've got our six SATA
three six gigabit per second ports here
as well as a post debug LED
thingamajiggy here's your front panel
connectors they've also included onboard
power and reset buttons very high-end
features once again despite a more value
image to this particular brand we have
four USB 2.0 front panel headers here's
your clear CMOS jumper and USB pw3 to be
honest I can't tell you what that does
okay so here is our slot layout we have
one PCIe 1x slot three PCIe 16x slots
although this one appears to be wired
for 4x only and then we have three PCI
slots so if you're running crossfire
you're gonna want to use these two blue
guys in fact this one is wired for 8 X
only so you'll be running 8 X 8 X which
does not impact performance
significantly and then if you wanted to
run 3-way crossfire I wouldn't really
recommend it because this is a 4 X slot
the Northbridge cooling is a pretty
again a pretty standard affair you've
got just a nice little tower heatsink
here with a little asrock logo one heat
pipe connecting it to the MOSFET cooler
which is again very standard very
functional let's move around to the back
of the board where we will find all of
our i/o and here what do we got so first
we've got 1 2 3 4 USB 2.0 ports then we
have a ps2 keyboard port VGA DVI and
HDMI interfaces for the onboard graphics
Hey
a back panel clear CMOS button that's
awesome considering that this is a value
board then we have an eSATA port
firewire USB 3.0 one gigabit ethernet
optical audio out as well as 7.1 audio
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the ass rock don't shoot you
know this doesn't happen to be very
often but I forgot what it's called the
house rock 890 GX Xtreme 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
