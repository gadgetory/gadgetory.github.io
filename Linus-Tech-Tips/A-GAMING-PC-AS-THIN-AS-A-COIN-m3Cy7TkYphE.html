is brought to you by the Corsair one and
synergy check them out at the link in
the video description we're here in the
msi booth checking out one of the
coolest desktops that i've seen today
mind you this is only the second Ruth
we've seen but trust me that doesn't
mean it's not cool if so it's called the
g25 because it's two and a half liters
of internal volume it weighs only two
point five kilograms and it is only 25
millimeters thin as they say so what
have they crammed inside here they've
got an overclockable quad core Core i7
up to 64 gigabytes of ddr4 memory with
for sodium expansion slots they've got
up to dual MDOT - SSDs running in raid
in addition to a two and a half inch
hard drive for actually tons of internal
storage and this is the kicker they've
got a gtx 1070 MXM so that's the mobile
variant but with full desktop grade
performance because opening this copy up
you can actually see that the top like
almost third of it is taken up by three
internal heat sinks and somewhere
between eight and nine heat pipes I was
having a hard time counting them because
apparently while I'm allowed to take the
panel off I'm not allowed to take things
apart in the MFI hoops anymore
apparently I got people in trouble at
CES and they won't let me do it but it's
okay because I'm not upset about that
and I'm not salty you can tell from the
tone of my voice going back to the
outside for a minute here we've got the
full complement of front i/o so your VR
power as well as HDMI you got dual type
a USB 3s as well as a Type C and
analogue audio out and then around at
the back you got well power in yeah
pretty beefy power in I think for a 1070
inside optical audio out another HDMI
you've got gave it Ethernet to more USBs
and a fundable 3-4 for pretty much any
expansion you'd want in terms of how you
deploy one of these you got a lot of
options they've got an early sample of
kind of a bottom stand here
you can stand it up kind of like a
PlayStation 4 or it's got feet on the
bottom here so you could lay it down
slap but watch your thermals because all
the air intake is on this side so if you
lay it down flat obviously you're not
going to have quite as good an
experience on the subject of experiences
because of all the power of this thing
they thought it running a triple monitor
demo over here which has this like weird
prototype like bezel eliminator optical
illusion thing and over on the other
side oh my god I'm all over the road
where they've got an unnamed product
that for now we're just going to call
the MSI VR racing simulator or something
this thing is not going to come cheap
it's going to be somewhere in the
neighborhood of five to eight thousand
dollars but it at least includes the
vortex v25 that's under the hood but
basically this is MSI's attempt to show
they can do more than just a gaming PC
box everything about it even the
software was written by MSI for VR
gaming
oh boy okay I think I just crashed so
then thanks for checking out our
coverage here at the msi booth you can
tell i'm like actually like crashing on
the gravel right now thanks to corsair
