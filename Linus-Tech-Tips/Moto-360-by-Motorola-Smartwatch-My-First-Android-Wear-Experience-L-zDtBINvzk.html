worked with me very briefly when I did
my Moto X and Moto G reviews then they
went silent for a bit and frankly I
didn't care anyway then the Moto 360 got
announced and went holy crap I need to
get in touch with Motorola again and
apparently so did every other reviewer
on the planet because I finally got one
a couple of weeks ago just like we
finally got the go-ahead to publish our
Sennheiser factory tour soon yay and so
here are my thoughts on the Moto 360
specifically and Android wear in general
I guess the Coolermaster Neptune 240m
features an exclusive pump design and
their new Silencio fans to provide
impressive near silent performance click
now to learn more the setup process with
the Android wear app is really simple
and pairing my phone worked effortlessly
but what exactly did I just pair my
phone to Hardware rundown time on the
inside of the watch you'll find 512
Meg's of RAM four gigs of storage
Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy a pedometer and
heart rate monitor dual microphones a
vibration motor a three hundred and
twenty milliamp hour battery that
supports wireless charging with the
included duct and finally and this has
been the source of much discussion about
this device even though it doesn't seem
to have a performance impact a Texas
Instruments TI OMAP 3630 processor which
is a four-year-old CPU design built on a
45 nanometer manufacturing process so
the speculation is that Motorola could
have potentially extended battery life
with something a little bit newer onto
the outside I've got the stone whore
Wien leather band online which i think
is pretentious hipster for not
waterproof but very lightweight and
comfortable dyed cowhide but if you
don't like leather that it's available
in a variety of well ok there's a
different color of leather but also it's
available with metal bands although the
tinkers among you may want to pick up
the leather model anyway and then a
pebble metal band for 30 bucks they're
actually compatible and you can do the
swap yourself if you're a little bit
handy the watch body itself is ip67
water and dust proof something you can
learn more about here if you feel like
it and features a heart rate monitor on
the bottom a state
the steel housing around the round watch
face with a microphone port on the left
and the watch's lone physical button on
the right then finally the main event a
1.5 6-inch 320 by 290 backlit LCD
touchscreen display covered in Corning
Gorilla Glass 3 I think this is a good
opportunity to say I was really
impressed with the watch's ruggedness
overall I'm pretty careless and in spite
of me wearing it every day for two weeks
the Moto 360 you see in our close-up
footage is in basically perfect
condition excellent considering that
this is what my daily driver watches
tend to end up looking like even if they
have Gorilla Glass the display is good
its 205 pixel per inch pixel density is
noticeably non-retina
but not enough to be normally
distracting in day to day use and
viewing angles are very good with full
brightness and a watch face with high
contrast between colors but in ambient
mode when the display is on but dim you
will need to look at it a bit more
directly what is ambient mode you might
ask well instead of just having the
display off or max brightness with a
very deliberate motion gesture required
to wake it up and the mode is much more
loosey-goosey about waking up when you
gesture more casually and then it stays
on I'll be at a lower brightness for
longer after activation allowing you to
use the watch more naturally you know
tilt it toward yourself on the couch use
it while lying on your back you know
pull up your sleeve before checking it
and lots of other stuff that doesn't
normally work very well in the regular
mode if you're using ambient mode you
can probably still get through a full
day on the battery but it's much tighter
and you can basically forget about using
a lot of the Android wear functionality
that's being added like running apps or
even games directly on the watch oh yeah
Linus Android wear how is that anyway
honestly right now pretty buggy
thankfully there were no outright
crashes or anything but while none of
this stuff happened consistently enough
for me to reproduce it on camera
here are some irritating bugs I've
encountered over the last couple of
weeks in no particular order refusing to
take voice commands while running
turn-by-turn navigation
failing to display incoming calls on the
watch even though I can clearly see
they're coming in on the phone and they
are connected switching to a playlist of
the ringtones on my phone when I receive
a text message while listening to Google
play music over a Bluetooth headset
displaying gobbledygook instead of
proper characters in place of weather
and date data and the list just goes on
and at times honestly the stuff that did
work correctly wasn't a lot better
thought out if I get text messages from
two different people in between checking
and responding to them not only can I
not do useful things like respond with
voice or marques read I can't even read
them hangouts handles this much better
with swipes to the right opening the
message that you start your swipe on but
not everyone likes hangouts Google and
another great example of this broken
functionality is Twitter direct messages
and mentions just pile up with the only
option being open on phone there I also
dislike the way information gets managed
sometimes music control is one of those
situations where if I'm listening to
music I probably want the control of it
at my fingertips and it'll get buried
under other cards as new notifications
roll in another is if I'm on a call it
would be nice if there was a
notification card for it
I can accept a call with the watch but I
can't terminate it I mean what if I used
my watch to take the call because I was
planning to use a speakerphone like if
I'm driving or a wired headset if I have
to take the phone out of my pocket to
hang up then the watch is very purpose
of me not needing to take out my phone
was defeated there is really great stuff
too though
reading hold emails instead of being
stuck with previews like the pebble is
almost a switchable advantage in and of
itself
Google now voice recognition worked
great for me indicating solid integrated
mics Dropcam notifications complete with
a snapshot of what's going on are
awesome for checking on the baby and
discovering that I could have my
turn-by-turn navigation on my wrist was
another almost switchable moment for me
and probably a lot of people who don't
have car mounts for their phones and
that's just that's just the tip of what
Android wear will be able to do in the
future and you can already get
cool stuff like third party watch face
managers I used face er which you can
use to download and create new watch
faces to augment the utterly anemic
stock selection although I have to say
it is appalling to me that you even need
a workaround with a third party tool for
this but I digress and then there are
other useful apps including the usual
SmartWatch you know ring my phone buzz
me if I go out of range and health
tracker stuff but also you know some
Android II stuff in there like custom
launchers which you can learn about here
calculators a Google keep integration a
network status change notifier a screen
lock or so errant water drops don't fire
up Google now all the time if you're in
the shower for example and even this
super handy spin-the-bottle app if you
happen to be a daring adolescent okay
that one's not that useful but at the
point is we're going to see more in the
future so bottom line though is it
awesome Linus are you ready to abandon
your pebble steel for Android wear the
answer is unfortunately no part of this
is the hardware I continue to believe in
the importance of multi day batteries
for mobile devices even though the
convenient wireless charging dock takes
some of the sting out but the biggest
part of the problem here for me is
software smart phones won me over to
single day batteries by giving me
doodles of functionality that my old
flip couldn't and while being able to
run apps in the background on a watch
something that pebble can't do opens up
a whole new world of possibilities
I would still personally hold off a
little bit more until Android wear
continues to mature because it will
mature I can already see it's going to
be awesome this isn't like the last time
the industry tried to tack extra
functionality onto what is classically
just a timepiece and a fashion statement
speaking of extra functionality our
friends over at the board have some
pretty sweet deals going on for a very
limited time just head over to Z board
shop calm slash Linus to save up to $300
on various editions of the Z board I got
a chance to check out the San Francisco
special edition of the Z board back in
July and you can watch my review video
of it here spoiler alert it's badass and
actually improved since then as well the
board itself is thinner and lighter
making it even easier to commute with
and start your destination and they have
a new urethane wheel upgrade available
that increases both the top speed and
the range of the board on a battery
charge very significantly pretty amazing
stuff they've got deals on all three
versions of the board as well as the
wheel and LED upgrade so you can
properly kid out your board for optimal
visibility and efficiency so head over
to the forum post link in the video
description where you can get the full

bet most of you didn't even notice that
they're offering as well as the full
details on the giveaway that they're
running for one of each model of the
board it's a great product I use mine
all the time these are great deals and
they're also just genuinely nice folks
