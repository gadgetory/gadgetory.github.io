model of starting out Hawking Ram sticks
with China heat spreaders on them and
then expanding into other product
categories but what they've certainly
done is made an art form out of doing it
well so while of course there isn't the
first of the companies that made
enthusiasts PC memory to try to enter
the graphics card space the recently
bankrupt and acquired by Toshiba ocz
claims that dubious honor maybe just
maybe they'll be the first one to do it
successfully because against the odds
that's what we have here today the hydro
gfx gtx 980ti
a collaborative project between corsair
and msi to make an all-in-one
water-cooled video card let's find out
how it performs
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster check out
the link in the video description to try
it for free
now having originally been released
nearly six months ago the gtx 980ti is a
bit of a known quantity at this point so
I'm not going to spend too much time on
the technology but it is worth
reiterating that it's a nearly full fat
GM 200 Maxwell chip so the same
underlying tech as the Titan X but with
a few CUDA cores and texture units
missing and a mere six gigs of gddr5
memory instead of 12 it's got a 250 watt
TDP and the reference card is clocked at
a thousand megahertz base ten
seventy-five megahertz boost with the
RAM at seven gigahertz regardless of
what GPU boosts 2.0 is doing to balance
the thermals power consumption and core
clock speeds and that right there is
where corsair figures their value at is
something of a PC cooling specialist
comes in cooler running computer
hardware has always been preferable but
while in the old days you had to
manually turn up the speeds or overclock
your components to take advantage of any
additional performance headroom kepler
and Maxwell architecture and video cards
are able to leverage it intelligently on
the fly allowing a cooler card to
effectively be running at a higher speed
more of the time so Corsair started then
by replacing the reference cards cooler
though if you ignore the illuminated NSI
logo instead of an Nvidia logo and the
braided tubes sticking out at the top of
it I'd forgive you for not really
feeling like they changed a whole lot
the shape is pretty much the same but
the metal housing is gone replaced
unfortunately by a plastic one and the
window that used to show aluminum
heatsink fins now shows the GPU block
and pump unit that makes up the
all-in-one cooler as well as a large
metal heat spreader that combined with
the rear exhaust blower fend that hasn't
been removed from the original design
keeps the memory and power delivery
components cool at the back Corsair has
added a backplate that thanks
fully features only a subtle
overclocking emblem instead of the
mishmash of logos on the front and side
of the card that is probably the result
of countless emails between Corsair and
MSI's product management teams back to
the rest of the physical tour cooling of
the GPU itself is handled by a corsair h
fifty-five all-in-one liquid cooling
unit with a slim 120 millimeter radiator
and one of Corsairs regrettably still
round frame but thankfully cool-looking
white LED fans overall I'd give coarser
and a Massiah be for the coherency of
this product looking at it it's not
really clear who makes it and compared
to AMD's fury X which powers the fan and
the pump off the card directly rather
than requiring the end-user to plug the
fan into a header on the motherboard or
two gigabytes water force 980ti that was
just announced that uses a non reference
PCB for the card itself it feels like
while Corsair didn't skimp on quality
this is a fairly tentative let's see how
this goes foray into making graphics
cards but all of that is just judging a
book by its cover something I would
never recommend doing as a computer
enthusiast since good things can
sometimes come in very unusual packages
so let's talk about how then we tested
the hydra GFX first we did away with the
open air test bench and installed our
x99 deluxe core i7 59 30 k 32 gigs of
vengeance lpx memory and a X 1200 eye
power supply in the cooler master master
case five pro case next we had to decide
what cards this monstrosity really
competes with Corsairs marketing
materials only really compare against a
reference 980ti and then they apply a
safe but definitely significant
overclock only to their own so while we
included all of those numbers to make
things more interesting we also threw in
a g1 gaming 980ti from gigabyte with
their win for triple fan cooler and an
AMD fury X since it's the only other
all-in-one liquid cooled card that we
have on hand let's start with
performance thanks to its aggressive out
of the box advert
beuse clock of nearly 1300 megahertz
this is a clear win for the hydro GFX
across the board although it should be
noted that its margin of victory is not
as much as you might think it would be
and for good reason
while the hydro gfx and the fury Expo
stood by far the best thermal results
like we didn't see that one coming not
to mention that under load they're
noticeably quieter than the air-cooled
cards in a well ventilated case like the
mastercase 5 both the hydro fury and
gigabytes open air triple fan cooler
design were able to achieve well over
their advertised boost clocks in our
tests and ended up a mere 13 megahertz
apart in our crysis 3 skybox thermal and
power test and there's even more to this
story yet GPU temps are one thing but we
also wanted to see how the open air
design would affect the temperatures of
the rest of the system and grabbed CPU
temps and motherboard power delivery
temps while running our load tests with
each of the cards and the g1 gaming
though actually not as much as I
expected
shows in this case the trade-off that
gets made when you opt for an open-air
cool design versus one that either
through rear exhaust directly or with
the use of a radiator expels heat
directly out of the case which I guess
leads us to the conclusion if life were
as simple as just by the best thing with
money as a complete non-issue then I
would be able to recommend the courser
hydra GFX without any hesitation but
life isn't that simple and at a price of
a hundred and twenty dollars more than
the cheapest reference card on Newegg
and seventy dollars more than a higher
tier air-cooled card like the g1 gaming
from gigabyte it does become a bit
harder to justify so I'll pose the
question to you then the audience are
you willing to spend a bit more and deal
with the bulkiness of an a io cooler
attached to your video card in exchange
for course there's legendary support
better performance and better thermals
for your card and your other components
or is the tax too high let us know down
below in the comment
and on that note today's episode sponsor
is need for sitcom makers of the max
anomic chairs that you've probably seen
in a lot of our behind the scenes videos
on the LAN show and well pretty much
anywhere that I Luke or any other member
of my team puts our butts down they've
got a wide variety of sizes and styles
available whether you're my size or Luke
size and whether you want something you
know just black and playing a
professional looking for the boardroom
or you're more into vibrant outstanding
colors and this is cool if you follow
them over at need for seat on Twitter
I'll have that linked in the video
description you'll be the first to know
the details of their upcoming Black
Friday promotion so if you've been
thinking about upgrading your gaming
chair these guys are awesome and
recently outfitted our whole office with
their chairs and we absolutely love them
so stay tuned
and check out what kind of special deals
they'll have available so thanks for
