billed as some kind of much cheaper
macbook killer but it doesn't run mac OS
and it's like $1000 so buy that line of
thinking what Windows notebook with an
aluminium shell isn't a cheaper MacBook
so then does it actually stand out from
the crowd as a true competitor or is it
just a look-alike knockoff well I'll get
to that after I tell you what's not a
knockoff today's sponsor tunnel bear
telomere makes it easy to privately and
securely browse a more open Internet
Tritonal bear for free go to Tunnel bear
comm /l tt
opening up the mean oppa Pro feels
really good the aluminum backing is
solid and so tastefully free of branding
that even Apple's light-up logo feels a
little tacky by comparison the hinge has
a satisfying weight to it without
requiring two hands to open it and this
theme of clean style and quality
construction is present throughout the
entire device even extending to the i/o
I mean I'd have loved to see Thunderbolt
3 but this is still a solid mix of ports
at this price point plus USB type-c
charging is nice to have the only part
of it that even sort of breaks the
illusion is the cheaper feeling bottom
panel but in regular use this is not an
issue at all what was an issue for me at
least is that we imported this thing
through gearbest.com and it was
pre-configured to Chinese so yeah no
problem Dennis can fix ah no he can't it
actually comes with a single language
Chinese version of Windows like we tried
to just deal with it like Chrome and
parts of some programs are still in
English so it's not impossible to get by
but to call the experience inconvenient
would be a gross understatement so for
me and my fellow Grillo's the only real
option is to reinsert it san insult to
me for me and my fellow pylos out there
the only real option is to reinstall
windows which in this case also meant
obtaining a fresh license key with that
sorted out though it was time to
actually get to using the me notebook
pro and good news here it is a powerful
little machine quad-core hyper threaded
core i5 8250 u 8 gigs of ram and get
this and NVIDIA MX 150 which is
basically a mobile
version of the GT 1030 I mean to be
clear you don't expect to be playing
modern triple-a titles at full
resolution but this is still heaps
better than integrated graphics even for
things like premiere or Photoshop or
older games and unlike some devices that
we've tested dedicated graphics doesn't
seem to have any negative impact at all
on the system cooling was more than
satisfactory with our CPU quietly
reaching a mere 53 degrees Celsius under
load with a small 2.1 gigahertz turbo
and the battery life blew our minds the
efficiency of this hardware including
intel's 8th gen u series cpu gave the me
notebook pro a staggering 10-hour 4
minute result in our battery life work
test that is a full 40 minutes longer
than our previous champion the LG gran
and it absolutely smashes other laptops
that are well-regarded for their battery
life like the dell XPS series Microsoft
Surface lap book and the MacBook Pro
running Windows but the most important
aspect of any productivity oriented
device is arguably the interface if the
keyboard and trackpad are constantly
annoying you nothing is going to save it
fortunately however the me notebook pro
actually gets these mostly right as well
the keyboard has a good layout that
commits no major sins and a reasonable
switch travel distance but if key caps
are quite poorly stabilized so if you
hit the keys off-center they do feel
really mushy which can affect accuracy
so I'll give that a b-minus
as for the trackpad despite its large
size we experienced no issues with palm
rejection the tactile feel when clicking
is nice and satisfying and although out
of the box it has quite a bit of sloppy
feeling acceleration
it's actually large enough that you can
disable acceleration entirely for a
great experience this one gets an a for
a Windows device the MacBook is still
way ahead of the pack and that's true
when it comes to screens as well but I
really don't mean that as an insult to
the me notebooks display it runs at a
mere 1080p 60 Hertz but it's bright with
wide viewing angles thanks to its IPS
panel so as long as you don't mind the
reflections that are an inherent part of
the glass-fronted screen experience you
will like it one thing I might have
changed is to add a touch screen option
though this is something that I feel
Apple has really been missing out on and
would give the Mino but pro a leg-up the
webcam is perfectly acceptable for Skype
calls and as for the Harman speakers
that boast Dolby Atmos certification
well I've yet to have an overhead or
surround at most experience on a
notebook but front positional audio was
outstanding especially considering their
downward firing positioning and while
for stereo content they do distort a bit
at full volume
they get loud before they get there and
they're surprisingly full sounding
making the me notebook pro a fantastic
portable Netflix machine let's get back
to that GPU now okay
yeah it's not amazing in games but it is
still a big upgrade from intel's
integrated solution rise of the Tomb
Raider not a good time but it handled
titles like rocket League
Skyrim and csgo handily so if you want a
casually game after studying then it's
got you covered there too opening up the
mean OPA Pro we can see where the
impressive battery life comes from from
an impressive battery this thing is
rated at 60 watt hours and since we're
in here we'll take a look at upgrade
ability too so adding another m dot to
SSD would be easy-peasy
but unfortunately the RAM is soldered so
if you're looking at one of these
I would recommend buying as much RAM as
you're gonna need probably the 16 gig
model unless you are a very light user
bottom line then starting at 9 79 us on
promo the me notebook Pro is an
impressive piece of hardware at a great
price that's made even greater if you
don't mind the Chinese Windows that's
included the inclusion of a dedicated
graphics processor will give it a longer
lifespan as GPU compute becomes more
important for productivity and the solid
construction should help it hold up
physically as long as you'd want to use
it
the remarkable battery life though is
what really makes it stand out against
other MacBook alternatives like the Dell
XPS so well done
