tower braid TR 4m and we've got the the
B model the black model so it's
available in both colors so this is
actually for the camera man's video
editing station because he's run out of
space and he needs a nice fast solution
for editing videos so let's have a look
at the accessory package to start we've
got an eSATA cable and we've got let's
see let's go here we've got okay that's
a power cord just a standard PC power
cord then we have thumb screws for
installing up to four hard drives so you
can see there's only two screws per
drive so we'll have to have a look at
the mounting system in a minute and then
a PCI Express 1x eSATA card which we
won't actually be using because the
Cameron does his editing on a laptop so
there's your quick installation guide
technical support and what appears to be
a drive your CD so now let's get into
the actual TR 4m unit itself pretty
reasonably sized for our forebay
enclosure okay so basically we've got a
shiny plastic finish both on the front
and on all sides so I'll get you to have
a look there hopefully that's pretty
good so you can see at the back we've
got an 80 millimeter exhaust fan you've
got your eSATA interface you've got a
switch here to switch between 115 volt
or 230 volts so make sure you've got the
right one enabled before you power this
baby up there's your power input and
then an on and off switch on the other
side you've got some more ventilation
holes so that's gonna draw air across
your hard drives and then out the back
of the unit and then let's have a look
at the front here so there's your
activity LEDs for your four hard drives
there's your host activity LED your
power LED and then let's open this baby
up
nope sorry so there you go you slide the
drives in one by one
and then there is a backplane on the
back of the unit itself on the inside
and let's actually just open this up so
that we can demo a little bit better
here so it's three Sloane screws on the
back and they're a little bit tight so
I'm gonna use my screwdriver to start
them here there we go and let's take off
the cover and then we can see the very
inner workings themselves okay I'll
slide this back that's pretty easy okay
so there you go so all you do is slide
the hard drive in okay so we've got a WD
black slide it in from the front you can
see it engages with the back plane right
about there
and then you use two of the included
thumb screws which had one and put
somewhere else to secure the drive on
both sides at the front actually it's
pretty straightforward it'd be nice to
see hot-swap but for the price you can't
really complain put it there anyway so
thank you for checking out my vlog on
