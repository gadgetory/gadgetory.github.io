you want performance or portability in a
laptop well a soos thinks they have
solved both of these problems by
creating a laptop that is only one and a
half millimeters thicker than a macbook
pro but houses a freaking GT X 1080
graphics card but even if you can cram
all of that hardware into a form factor
like this can a machine this thin
possibly get the most out of those
components not quite but it gets close
enough to watch the video and see how
well they did
CyberPower pcs lineup of gaming desktops
feature intel seventh generation core i7
processors check them out at the link
below the rog Zephyrus looks and feels
special and is possibly the most 2017
laptop that we've ever seen almost all
the boxes are checked it's been it's
light especially for a gaming laptop and
there is plenty of brushed aluminum and
RGB lighting there is a tiny bit of flex
around the keyboard and screen but for
something this thin the chassis is
impressively rigid so full marks here I
also feel like this might be some of the
best industrial design to come out of
Asus so far it strikes a wonderful
middle ground between premium gamer II
and professional and honestly I don't
think you'd feel weird pulling it out of
a backpack a briefcase or even a trendy
messenger bag looking a little closely
err when you open the Zephyrus you can
see why it's named for the Greek god of
the west-wind
and bringer of light spring this six
millimeter gap at the back is the one
somewhat flimsy feeling thing on this
device but it serves a couple of
purposes inclining the laptop slightly
for a more comfortable typing experience
and helping it move warm wait did I say
warm sorry I mean hot hot air away from
the components crammed into this puppy
is an NVIDIA GTX 1080 an Intel Core i7
7700 HQ a 500 gigabyte nvme SSD to boot
and up to 24 gigs of DDR 4 RAM although
North American models will ship with 16
gigs IO wise the Zephyr ax strikes a
great balance again thin enough to be
very portable but thick enough that you
can fit three full-sized USB
Taipei's Thunderbolt 3 HDMI and a
headphone jack a soos even Chuck's a USB
to Ethernet adapter in the box so you
don't have to game over Wi-Fi but and I
feel like we need to get this out of the
way pretty early in the review the
Zephyrus doesn't defy the laws of
physics and when we hit it with a full
synthetic load the thermal solution got
overwhelmed and we did experience some
thermal throttling a lot of thermal
throttling with that said in a more
realistic load like actual games at room
temperature both our CPU and GPU put up
a much stronger showing now as some of
you have probably figured out by now at
1500 megahertz the max-q GTX 1080 in
here is probably not going to keep pace
with a full-sized desktop one or even a
full TDP mobile one the kind you'd find
in bulkier gaming laptops but it's still
enough to crush games at the native
1080p resolution and 120 Hertz refresh
rate of the IPS g-sync display it trails
it's 1080 brethren by anywhere from 7 to
as much as 20% but it should be noted
that compared to the bigger heavier
Alienware 15 it's 10 to 15 percent
faster so it's 1080 hasn't been down
clocked to the point where you might as
well have saved a few bucks and gone
with a 1070 acoustics were another
strong point it's very impressive how
the Zeus was able to keep a laptop this
thin so quiet it's easily one of the
quietest gaming laptops that we've
tested with it not even being in the
same ballpark as the g7 o1v I went under
load but also not particularly loud are
the speakers which along with the webcam
get a solid fine out of 10 rating the
keyboard though is both quiet and
comfortable it features full RGB
lighting with two zones and the throw on
the keys
short but they provide enough feedback
that I never questioned whether I
actually pressed the key at a desk with
the thankfully included wrist rest it
feels amazing
but on your lap the position of the
keyboard means that some folks will have
a bit more difficulty balancing it at
first but it's actually surprisingly
easy to get used to and at any rate you
won't have to worry about using it on
your lap for very long the zephyrus
doesn't use Optimus technology to switch
to onboard graphics at idle so the
battery life is abominable even while
performing mundane tasks and the numpad
trackpad combo doesn't get great marks
either I could get used to the position
but the shape just kind of sucks I
understand why they did it under the
normal keyboard area is where you'll
find all that juicy hardware with
swappable sodium and storage slots which
is nice but I don't have to like it
thankfully though asus includes a decent
gaming mouse in the box so i would
recommend just using that all in all if
nothing else the ACF rest feels like
something new sure it doesn't offer the
best performance available but if that's
what you're going for get a desktop
because it as close to an
apples-to-apples comparison as we could
find the value of this little beast is
actually pretty compelling if you're
willing to sacrifice a little bit of
performance in exchange for sex appeal
