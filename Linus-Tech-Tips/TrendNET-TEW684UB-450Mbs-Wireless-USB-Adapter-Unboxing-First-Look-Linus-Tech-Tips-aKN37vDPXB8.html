box this is the trendnet te w 684 you be
yeah it doesn't have a sexy name or
anything but what's cool about this
device is that it is the first USB 450
megabit per second dual-band wireless-n
USB adapter so yes it is a USB 450
megabit per second wireless device I'm
going to go ahead and open this little
guy up here that was in a very small box
I mean it's a USB device so it couldn't
be it's going to be that large right I
mean it could be that wouldn't take much
sense all right here we go so here's
what trendnet has to say about 450
megabit per second dual band it is
better than 450 megabit it is better
than 300 megabit dual-band better than
300 megabit and speed as well as 150
megabit per second so it is the best
okay got it right here we see what the
device looks like but we're going to see
that when we open it up here we see how
to use it to connect to computer okay
and then it is wirelessly connected to
your router and they recommend the te w
691 gr which I happen to have one up
here we go so I have a whole fleet of
trendnet 450 megabit per second devices
so you can bet there will be a tech tips
upcoming on that shortly alright so
there they show the other devices so the
698 p is the one that I don't have but
that's fine because the 690 ap is just
an AP version of the 691 gr which is a
full router of a more interesting
product anyway so your it is actually
looks like a little tiny version of the
trendnet te w 687 GA so the GA is the
gaming adapter which is a use as a
gigabit ethernet interface rather than a
USB 3 interface and then actually here
I'll show it to you so there's the 68 70
a so you can see the size difference and
i'll do the obligatory iphone size
comparison as well just so you guys can
see how big this thing is
not super large it could easily be
carried if you are going to travel and
you were going to bring this guide with
you okay so it uses micro hold on hold
on I can never remember that USB three
cable standards ah alright this is USB 2
so it just uses a B cable now mini be
there we go good I know the USB two
months now you have it so then it plugs
in via a normal USB 2.0 port so bear in
mind of course guys that USB 2 okay USB
2 is 480 megabit per second as I recall
so what that means is that with this one
device you can pretty much saturate your
USB to bus but I mean I wouldn't worry
too much about that because you're not
going to be using the full throughput of
this device very often that's only when
you're transferring large files at a
time so you can see it's got a one
button setup button up here WPS there
you can see that now and the bottom it
has the mac address as well as the
serial number on the back there's your
USB and it pretty much looks like this
there's not much more to say so there's
a WPS light and activity light as well
as a power light on the front why don't
go ahead and plug that in I can show you
what the indicator lights look like so
I'm just going to come over here plug
this into my test computer and hopefully
there you go so that's what those lights
are going to look like geez focus mr.
camera there we are alright so thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the
trendnet wireless n 450 megabit per
second te w 684 you be don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos please focus mr. camera you know
I think it's having a hard time focusing
because it's so shiny there see now you
can see it oh I missed something there
it actually comes with a quick
installation guide I'm going to show you
how to use WPS as well as plug it into
your computer and a driver and utility
DVD that has the user's guide on it as
well rather seedy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
