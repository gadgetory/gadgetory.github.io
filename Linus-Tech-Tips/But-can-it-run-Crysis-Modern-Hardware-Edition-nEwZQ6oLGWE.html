question from the glory days of gaming
and computers when we all still used
optical drive Windows Vista was still a
thing and 4k was just a glimmer in some
developers eye since the glory days were
a full eight years ago we decided that
it was time to ask that question again
but with modern hardware and see if
we've gotten any closer to being able to
run Crysis without having to use a like
military supercomputer or something give
the video like if you're interested in
seeing another video on the steam
controller
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check out the link in
the video description to learn more so
the goal here was to check out how well
modern product stacks from both AMD and
from Nvidia could run a completely
notoriously demanding title from
yesteryear namely The Witcher 2
assassins of Kings from 2011 and the
affer mentioned Crysis 1 from 2007 we
ran both games at 1080p with the
settings completely maxed out including
an abling uber sampling on the witcher 2
which is an extremely hard to run
anti-aliasing setting that was infamous
for causing huge performance hits on
GPUs at the time our AMD GPU stack
included the top-end r9 nano and a su
Strix Radeon 390x a gigabyte windforce
r9 290 a sapphire r9 285 compact an MSI
gaming r9 270 and finally a reference r7
260x on the nvidia side we used of
reference geforce gtx 980ti a gigabyte
g1 gaming GTX 980 an amp Omega Edition
GTX 970 from ZOTAC an asus strix gtx 960
and a gtx 950 with the reference gtx
750ti for comparison as well we threw in
a couple older cards - like a GeForce
GTX 480 as well as an 8800 GT which was
released around the same time as these
games were for both brands we use the
latest drivers as of mid October 2015
all of our testing took place on our
standard test bench consisting of an
Intel Core i7 59 30k processor and a
soos x99 deluxe motherboard 16 gigabytes
of Corsair Vengeance ddr4 ram a samsung
850 pro 1 terabyte SSD a corsair h 100 a
GTX all-in-one cooler and a corsair ax
1200 I fully modular power supply quite
a far cry from your average high-end rig
from back when crisis was released and
people were unboxing their shiny new q
66 hundreds with all that said let's get
right to the results people who utilized
the answer to but cannot run Crysis as
the definitive measure
ring stick for any gaming rig back in
the late 2000s would probably be
pleasantly surprised at how much DP use
have evolved since then all but one of
our modern cards achieved playable frame
rates at 1080p with everything maxed out
with higher-end cars starting at the GTX
970 and the r9 290 getting frame rates
between the mid 70s and low 90s not too
surprising when you consider that for
example the 980ti has more than four
times the number of cuda cores as one of
the most popular top-end cards back when
crisis came out the GeForce 8800 ultra
the only modern card that came up short
was our 750 Ti which only mustered 8
frames per second not so great and
therefore cannot really run Crysis but
while these numbers are fine if you have
a 1080p 60 Hertz monitor they might
leave you feeling a little disappointed
if you wanted to run Crysis higher
resolutions or frame rates than you did
back in the mid-2000s but when you
consider the fact that frame rates in
the 80 to 90 range are what you'll get
on a number of much more recent titles
on modern hardware you can have expected
Crysis to run far better than it did for
us additionally we noticed some very
prominent screen tearing on a lot of our
cards basically all of them so while our
modern tech stack from GPUs past the but
cannot run Crysis test it wasn't really
with flying colors moving on to the
witcher 2 we experienced slightly lower
numbers as the game is only about four
years old as opposed to eight but still
playable frame rates and for the most
part that's what we got with everything
maxed out and uber sampling enabled we
saw a range from 27 frames per second on
a gtx 950 and the r9 270 to 65 FPS on
the gtx 980ti the only cars that didn't
achieve playable frame rates were the r7
260x and again the gtx 750ti
interestingly we saw some pretty
significant differences between AMD and
NVIDIA cards during our which are two
benchmarks although team red and team
green were a lot closer on our Crysis
tests Nvidia ran away
from AMD in The Witcher 2 with even the
top-end r9 nano and r9 390x trailing the
GTX 970 by a full 9 fps and falling even
further behind when compared to the top
of the Nvidia stack cards we suspected
this was due to AMD cards reacting
weirdly with uber sampling so we tested
without uber sampling running and saw
the FPS jumped to 101 on the nano but I
still liked behind the GTX 970 which put
out 117 FPS we dug a little bit further
and we found that the nano was
throttling its GPU usage quite a bit
which might also explain the strange
results we got in The Witcher 2 when we
tested it on another AMD card the Radeon
7970 back in 2012 you can check out the
results of that video up here but
regardless of which teams card you have
in your rig I wouldn't expect buttery
smooth gameplay at higher than 1080p
resolutions if you cranked everything up
this games pretty intense to run but
even though the numbers might be
slightly underwhelming considering how
long both of these games have been on
the market we've still obviously made a
lot of progress in terms of how much
your dollar will get you our GTX 480 a
top-end card back in 2010 only put out
40 FPS in crisis and 24 fps in which r2
with uber sampling which was beaten by
the $170 r9 270 and a DTX 950 and just
in case you've forgotten how difficult
it was to run Crysis our super
old-school 8800 GT crashed out of crisis
but was able to get 6 fps in witcher 2
so what's our conclusion other than this
was pretty fun it's pretty clear that
there's been a big improvement over the
past few years of what you can do with
even just a mid-range GPU but games that
are legendarily difficult to run will
still live up to that reputation to a
certain extent obviously you're still
going to be in a great position to enjoy
older titles if you have a decent modern
card under the hood but if you ask your
system can you run Crysis at 4k you
might not get that fantastic of an
answer unless you're packing a lot of
heat
