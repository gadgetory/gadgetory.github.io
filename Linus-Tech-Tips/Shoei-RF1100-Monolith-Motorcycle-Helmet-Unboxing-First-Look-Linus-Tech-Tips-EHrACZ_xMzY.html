morning has subsided because they did
manage to drop off my helmet to the
local post office which frankly isn't
that close to our office it's like
that's a good 10-15 minute drive and you
know whatever anyway I don't care my
helmet is here which means I can ride my
bike this weekend and that is all that
matters yes I had to take off from the
office for about 40 minutes to go pick
it up but my boss will never know unless
he watches this video in which case he
will know so whatever all right well
there's my invoice so as you can see
helmets are quite expensive this is a
shoei rf-1100 monolith helmet so the
color I got is tc5 and you'll see the
design on it in a few minutes here but
you know what there really isn't there's
really isn't a price when it comes to
protecting your head so I went with
whatever fit I did try on quite a few
different brands of helmets I didn't go
straight for the showi because they are
pretty expensive but you have to find
something that a comes in a size that
fits you really snug and beat has a
shape that's appropriate for your head
so there's the cheek pads and you know
what why don't we we'll put on the
helmet and I'll explain the fit as we do
that so it just comes in a in a plain
box for safety evidently okay monolith
tc5 so it's a silver and black I'm a
size small in case anyone was wondering
my helmet size by the fit on this helmet
is actually quite similar in my
experience to the Scorpion EXO 700 and I
believe the XL 1000 uses the same shell
as well so if you fit the shoei rf-1100
quite well you'll probably also fit the
Scorpion but I didn't find a place to
try on the Scorpion until I had already
ordered this one
so live and learn the Scorpion is
actually a few hundred dollars cheaper
but it doesn't have quite the same
technology that goes into the
manufacture as as a showy helmet does so
here we are how do you use your helmet
properly there's a little
you will read it before use it comes in
a variety of different languages there's
a warning okay thank you for purchasing
and wow they've okay here so shows you
how to put it on shows you how to check
the retention strap okay that's fine and
then we've got Wow more instructions
look at that so oh it shows you all the
different vents okay so there's lots of
different vents in this helmet and you
open up the vents if you want to well
get more ventilation it shows you the
way to use the quick-release system for
the visor how to remove and fix it how
to let me see what else how to remove
the interior you can actually remove the
entire interior of this helmet and wash
it if you want you could use shampoo to
wash a helmet not detergents because it
will be up against your hair on a fairly
regular basis okay how to put it back
together installing the chinstrap cover
it has a breath guard as well so there's
probably something in here about yeah
installing the chin curtain how to
replace the lower air intake wow there's
this is actually like look at this this
is pretty in-depth hard bar okay that's
the end of the English section alright
so that's it for the documentation
there's a couple accessories here I wish
I could tell you exactly what these are
but I'm gonna have to go through it
later this is probably sits here
somewhere
and this might be a breath guard of some
sort I'm not sure let's just get the
helmet out and then people we will know
everything for certain at that time so
it comes in a nice little baggie which
could hold a gym strip later on down the
road when you do not need to store your
helmet in the baggie all the time okay
it's actually kind of a nice little bag
got a little drawstring there and there
is my helmet so just kind of look at the
overall sort of fit and finish I mean I
guess there's nothing here that's really
beyond expectations this is how most of
the vents work they're just little
sliders like that so you can either open
them up or close them okay so I believe
the front one works in a
that is quite similar there you go so
you can either open that up and get some
more ventilation to close it and then
there are exhaust ports in the back
which you also need to open up should
you require more head cooling so oh
let's talk about these safety safety
approvals that are on here so it's dot
which basically means that it has passed
the basic safety for helmet use in North
America but it's also approved by the
smell I think it's a smell foundation or
something like that and Snell means that
it meets the DOT approvals except better
so Snell is basically a tighter
certification there's also a new one
that's come out and that's more of a
European standard but thumb helmets are
coming with those as well it is made in
Japan all right it's got the showi
branding here I chose the model of
helmet because I like the graphic on it
it's not quite all black so it's gonna
be a little bit easier to see than
something that's really really dark but
it also has a little bit of white on it
so it will be a little bit more visible
guess I could put it on oh we can check
out the inside so there's the inside
there's all the different padding's and
whatnot there's some warnings at the
back and all right here why don't we put
it on then we can talk a little bit
about the fit as well so
so helmet should come down right to your
brow pretty much when you move it around
you should actually see the skin on your
brow move so you're not you're not
moving the helmet around on your head
you're actually moving the skin with it
that's how you know you have a snug
enough fit I hope you can hear me okay
okay so I'll pull that down and
cameraman says yes thank you cameraman
also the cheek pads should be quite
tight now bear in mind you can buy a
replacement cheek pad so if the head
fits all the way around and you don't
feel any pressure points with the helmet
snugly down on your head then you know
you have the right fit up here but if
your cheeks are loose and you can wiggle
it side to side then what you can do is
you can actually buy thicker cheek pads
or if you find your face incredibly
squished then you can actually get
smaller ones so let me just go ahead
okay you probably can't hear me when I
close that I can't see anything because
of the sticker but there's the helmet
and so I'm super stoked to go riding
this weekend and they can protect me
yell Dinah's tech tips cameraman is
telling me to do something oh he wants
me to put this down again cameraman is
fascinated by the Springs and gears and
all the different little workings of the
helmet on the side here for the visor so
there's a couple different features I
can show you here first of all is this
one right here so if you push it down
like that it opens up the helmet just a
tiny crack so that's for when you want
just the tiniest little bit of
ventilation but you want it mostly
closed like say for example when it's
raining so then you put it back back
normal and then there's actually a
locking mechanism now where you can lock
the helmet down into the position that
it's in so I don't know if the lock
actually yeah yeah oh nope no it only
works when it's all the way closed so
the lock only works when it's closed and
then there's the little feature to crack
it open a little bit so there you go
that is the visor feature I haven't
showed how to use the quick-release
because frankly I don't know I think
it's something to do with this side but
I'm sure the instructions will tell me
more
