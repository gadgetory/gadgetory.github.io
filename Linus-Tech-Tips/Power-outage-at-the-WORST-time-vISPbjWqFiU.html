they said he's crazy well we'll see
who's crazy now in this moving vlog
office update video thing because this
puppy was worth its weight well maybe
not quite its weight it's very heavy but
almost its weight in gold
gee fuel has put together a very super
fantastically awesome GTX today the
giveaway for the Linus tech tips
community enter for a chance to win at
the link below we have no power but we
do have des mots guys yeah this is not
good we have things to do today like a
lot of things we still have all the
cameras all the batteries are charged so
we can still do that we can't like do
any editing I was helping a lot
oh yeah so do you need those other two
yeah I wanted to at least like let's get
some exit interview shot yeah oh I hit
everything it's just a blog yeah this is
just a vlog to tear into my thing plug
up our block this is the room for people
that can't really help right now so
we're trying to stay yeah that's a good
idea office moving blog like one I
didn't like glass feet I like was you
opening presents and then finding a frog
it was super boring
if we need to do any editing we could
only possibly do it on a laptop Oh
course it's really hot in here because
my fans not right
oh it is hot in here Jesus oh yeah so
Onix ah I'm running this extension cord
for room so that in the editing den they
can run a laptop the videos must be made
yeah there we go all right well I'll
start editing uh how much time do you
need with the server because I'm
guessing you'll need to pull some files
over um that's probably a good idea I
don't I don't know it's not working
unfortunately it's really letting myself
down and we're trying to get some stuff
off the right now through a lot of work
and frustration I finally managed to get
all the files that I need for today's
vessel and YouTube videos they're all on
this laptop and on this SSD now we're
going to go somewhere where there's
power and shoot the stuff that we need
to shoot and I'll edit the stuff that I
need to edit what are we going Luke's
house has power we get a moving vlog out
of it right because we are all moving to
Luke's parents house you are on the
fastest route and your route is clear
you should reach your destination by
12:20 p.m. arrived and Luke's parents
house and now I'm set up everything
right here what a freaking day so day
for scrap yard worse time for judging Oh
the power's out so we picked up
everything and we brought it to Luke's
house where there's still power I'm
sorry yes ma'am ex is here this is
thanks student film Wow
what you guys doing blown up this bubble
all thingies I like my team here we got
three shoots done today in spite of the
power going out and it's actually only
seven o'clock well the way we have power
oh man that's uh that's a nice sight
when did we get power back what a day
but there's war too and for that I will
hand off to the others Brandon can you
explain what the heck this is so when we
built the office we had decided that the
b-roll set was gonna go in this spot but
we didn't actually decide what we were
gonna put there originally we had just
put two like eight-foot tall white walls
that were pretty boring so I finally
decided to get some help to actually do
these we're going for like a space
sci-fi kind of design so you can see
that we have these panels that are
supposed to kind of mirror like metal
they're made out of wood and we're going
to run LEDs throughout the background of
them to get different colors for various
view or thoughts so and there's a
secondary level that is actually
structurally sound that will be put up
there with grading and windows that are
going to be angled throughout the top of
it the entire way around so yeah work in
progress but I'm pretty stoked on all
the b-roll that you guys are going to
get to see through this but there are
more updates and for that I will hand
over to Luke
now I'm stoked for the VR room which is
this room that wind right now this used
to be the library but as it only had
like two books in it and we used it for
like weird random meetings not normal
meetings it didn't seem to require so -
Devon let me put VR stuff in here now
the oboe is going to be in the corner
where like this weird desk and we're
sher used to be and then we're going to
have a vr computer right near the door
which will eventually have a
wall-mounted screen and probably the
computer will be wall-mounted as well
right now it just has my test bench on
it and like some screen on a random
table to reference the UPS from earlier
