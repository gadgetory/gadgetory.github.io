brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX we're kicking things off in
the Intel booth with something really
really exciting these guys are called
open bionics and they're using intel's
realsense 3d camera in order to print 3d
hands and then skin the the arm that
they are going to then create a socket
for and then they actually can put the
hand on someone who doesn't actually
have a hand I mean this is holy crap
this is amazing so the way it works is
okay that is incredible so the way it
works is there are actually sensors
attached to the muscles on Dan's arm
here that allow him to control this hand
and can you tell me about what it's like
to use it well it's pretty surreal to be
honest with you like I was born with one
hand so obviously I was able to adapt
and now I'm adapting to using two hands
so this now is my third day of using it
on the go so this our beta this is our
second prototype and it's coming so
natural to me to be using so it's crazy
it's it's surreal but I loving it and we
getting so much great feedback from
anybody and it's just awesome to be part
of so yeah I don't know I just so much
emotions right now that's crazy I think
that is so incredible it takes
apparently three to four days to print
one hand so there's a lot of work still
to be done but it's incredible because I
mean what would thirty years ago 35
years ago whenever Empire Strikes Back
came out you look at that scene where
you know Luke Mark Hamill gets his hand
put back on you go WOW holy crap maybe
in a thousand years I don't know man
that's awesome I've been a few people
that said that and it's it's pretty cool
to be bad to be saying oh you're like a
bit like Zeke's Coco like heli I'm like
yeah well I love it it's amazing so I
sort of slightly filled cyborg II as
well but I don't mind I like that that's
cool that's so cool man but the 3d
printing amazingness doesn't stop there
at the Intel booth this is a concept
well it's a piece of hardware that has
to do with a concept that Intel is
calling blended reality which is
basically the idea that we can take
digital objects and turn them into real
objects through 3d printing in fact
they've got some 3d printed stuff over
here that's pretty cutting-edge stuff so
a some stuff that's printed out much
finer than we've been able to do in the
past be they've got a link right here
that can support ten thousand pounds
they've also got a working pair of
scissors and a 3d printed spring and
then the whole blended reality thing
also encompasses taking real objects and
turning those into digital objects that
we can then modify and do with as we
please so I'm going to go ahead and fire
up the HP sprout it's a pretty normal
looking for the most part all-in-one PC
at first glance it's got a Core i7
processor eight gigs ram one terabyte
drive it comes with a wireless keyboard
and mouse 1080p screen touchscreen all
that good stuff but this right here this
magnetic 20 point multi-touch
interactive surface thing is where the
magic happens so I'm gonna go ahead and
do a 2d capture that goes pretty much
instantaneously I'm just gonna let it
kind of do its thing there's four
cameras up here in this top mounted unit
and infrared one a real sense 3d one
that does depth sensing as well as two
additional ones and there's a projector
reflector that turns this bottom piece
right here into a perfectly usable
twenty point multi-touch screen so I'm
going to go ahead and click confirm and
we're gonna have these objects show up
in our image library that we can then
use the interface here to go ahead and
interact with so here's the ones that I
just scanned I'm going to go ahead and
throw my little fabric pattern thing on
here I can rotate this I can you know I
can write on it or whatever else the
case may be I'll go ahead I'm gonna pick
this pen you know hello
and
what's cool about this is that aside
from being able to use it as like a
creative workspace that can also just be
used as a secondary screen so this is a
great demo where they're just firing up
maps and whipping things around it's not
the highest resolution thing in the
world but it's more about the
functionality of it then necessarily the
you know the number of pixels now the
really cool thing here those I mentioned
turning 3d objects into 3d renders so
the demo that they showed us is scanning
this mask now it's not perfect yet so my
first question was you know yes we can
scan sort of the the top surface of it
but there are some gaps are you guys
going to be able to create full 360
degree models of these on the computer
and the answer is with a piece of
hardware that will augment this rather
than replace it yes so there's gonna be
like a rotating table
this is freaking amazing stuff right
here so speaking of amazing stuff our
amazing sponsors thank you for sending
us down here one of them is phantom
glass these guys make the best on screen
protectors out there they're Gorilla
Glass so they're perfectly clear they
feel good on your fingers they're easy
to apply with no bubbles and they're
extremely durable you can check those
out at Store da phantom Dawg glass and I
want to do a shout out to HyperX those
guys have a great YouTube channel for
lots of great gaming content youtube.com
slash hype Rex we've got both those guys
linked in the video description don't
miss any of our CES content by making
sure you're subscribed and I think that
pretty much wraps this video up was that
cool or what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
