my personal project has been on hold for
a while in fact slick pointed out to me
that in the entire time he's been
working with me
my personal rig has been sitting in this
mess on this test bench which is
obviously devastating for all of us so I
may have the solution to the problem
that has stymied me so there's only so
many x79 boards in the world
this one's ugly isn't it that one coil
whines when transferring over the
network even if I have an add-in card
this one is XL ATX so it doesn't fit in
mighty jo7 case I asked there that's the
gigabyte one and there you can't see it
and this one this one's funny because
this one coil whines when it's under a
light load so I'm gonna actually do
something a little different I'm gonna
put my camera here sitting next to the
CPU socket I'm gonna walk away oh no I
have to show you that says first so
check this out it's so so prime95 oh
come on focus please
thank you come on there you go whatever
prime95 is here running right now no
coil one no normally coil line and if
you guys don't know what Quayle line
sounds like you're about to find out so
normally quail line shows up worst when
you're under an intensive load so okay
this is listen listen ready and I'm
gonna stop the torture test and you're
gonna hear it kick in
isn't that obnoxious
so since I'm aiming to build a silent
water-cooled machine obviously I don't
want it making little whining noises
next to me I am really hoping that this
board will be the solution to my problem
rampage four extreme isn't going to do
it for me because it's a blue and black
themed build so end with a gold accent
so the asrock extreme board the Xtreme
11 really caught my eye because it has
gold caps it's an all black board the
one thing that really bothers me about
it right off the bat is this fan right
here but I'm going to see if there's
anything I can do about that
few other cool things about this part or
the fact that it has seven DIMM slots
with 2 plx chips so it's capable in
running of running sixteen eight eight
eight eight eight eight bandwidth insane
right
it also has eight DIMM slots and it's a
standard ATX form factor board so what
I'm hoping is that when I swap this into
my test bench there I'm not going to run
into any quelle line otherwise I'm still
not gonna know what to do with my system
build okay board swap is complete it's
moment of truth time does the ass rock
Xtreme 11 whine like a little girl or is
it going to allow me to build a silent
water-cooled x79 machine
heythat's fans for now let's keep an eye
on this fan right here because if that
turned this up very high they're not
that's gonna be a big problem for me as
long as it runs at a nice low rpm or
maybe doesn't turn on at all unless it's
needed well that might be the smartest
thing I ever did see posted that's
always a good sign you know what why
don't I wait till I get into Windows and
then I'll update you guys okay now it's
time for the real moment of truth let's
try a high CPU load so I'm gonna run
prime95 small FF team and leave the
camera right write it before and you
guys can find out with me - here we go
it sounds like we have a winner actually
it sounds like nothing which is perfect
let's try and blend test just to be sure
oh no I'm gonna try blend test with with
more random usage so let's go 15 games
around even if we hit it pretty hard for
blend the ass rock extreme 11 shrugs it
off although as soon as we kick it into
high load you hear that noise that just
started up that little fan is gonna go
and I wonder why it's doing that because
it's cooling the chipset as well as oh I
wonder if they did it because of heat
whoa that's running hot a couple plx
chips down there you know what let's
turn off the plane test and see what
happens because that's gonna be a
deal-breaker
cuz I really doubt that I can find my
desktop and see if it turns off cuz I
really doubt that I can find any kind of
water block for this board I just don't
think that's gonna happen
wow what a shame so there you go guys
the ass Rock extreme 11 wins the pwm
award for not being loud but loses the
chipset cooling a warrant for having up
your AC little fan on the South Bridge
as we used to call them
so disappoint okay so I still don't have
a board so I'll update you guys as soon
as there's any kind of update but for
now I'm going to show the msi back on
