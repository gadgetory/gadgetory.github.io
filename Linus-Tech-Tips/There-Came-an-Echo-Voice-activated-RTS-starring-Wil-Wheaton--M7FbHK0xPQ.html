2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair alright guys I'm here the indie
mega booth with there came an echo I've
been hearing about this game ever since
we landed and I've had to check it out
we've been busy but we're finally here
and I got to play it myself and it's
it's one hell of an experience and they
don't even have the voice actors in
there yet so what what is this game what
can you tell me about this game this is
a voice controlled realtime strategy
game it's a little complicated we're in
the core to help the one race the Delta
3 on my mark
Maranda fire on my mark let's do it
great Wil Wheaton and Ashly Burch star
in the game and you're controlling a
squad through various tactical scenarios
with your voice and you say things like
all units to alpha one
shields up focus fire on target to
tactical decisions like that and it's a
really narrative based experience and
it's a lot of fun to control your voice
so it sounds really really cool when he
talks about that but some things that
you guys might be worried about is like
oh well I don't really know military
commands I'm not gonna remember to say
took brow Bravo - or any of that kind of
stuff so what you guys have something in
place where I can you explain how that
works yeah so we have this system called
command aliasing I can tell you what the
basic military commands are but it's a
little tough to remember all those and
even if you do maybe it's not the way
you want to commander guys so we have
the system where you can replace any
existing command or character or
location or anything in the game with
whatever you want if you don't want to
call them corn you can call them
benedict cumberbatch if you don't want
the command to be fired you can say mess
those guys up and this can be completely
customized however you want and it's one
of those things that you kind of just I
understand that it's a little you might
be a little skeptical about voice
commands about the Gaul that might not
be very accurate or that's not very good
you've got to just try it I mean you
just had a chance to give it a shot it's
it's very very accurate and I want
everyone to give it a shot that said we
do also support controller keyboard and
mouse commands as well so however you
want to play as cool with us yeah like
for instance I Elias Corps in one of the
guys in the game tooth - so I could use
him as my suicide fighter because I
don't care about - he's not even here
right now so I can say that if you see
right now I would be in so much trouble
anyways like what are some of the risks
you see in coming this because we come
to the indie mega booth and we see so
much innovation but you guys guys like
this like I'm excited to pick this game
up I'm gonna pick this game up put a
like dropping budget on Wil Wheaton and
stuff like that like it's a huge name
are you worried about
I mean well yes that's that a huge risk
yet yes it is I mean it's this whole
game a huge risk yes it is there are not
a lot of voice controlled games out
there but to me it's like I I want to do
something different you know I
yes it's I had them up we did our first
game sequence it made a good bit of
money and I could have gone and maybe
made a sequel to that or I could have
done a retro 2d platformer I guess not
that there's anything wrong with that
anyone's watching and likes retro but I
wanted to try something really different
I wanted to try to create an emotional
connection between the player and the
characters in the game and I think
actually talking to them and having them
talk back with some great voice actors
is a really really cool way to do that
it's just more about what I really love
and what I really wanted to see happen
that's that's a perfect answer in
exactly what I wanted to hear because
that's what I love seeing in the indie
Meaghan booth and honestly within the
very short period of time I had to play
it it's it's you get a connection with
it immediately like it's I cared more
about those people because I wasn't just
drag and dropping a mouse and throwing
them into the battle I actually had to
tell him with his name go there and if
he dies from doing that I'm gonna feel
bad that's your fault and more than that
they talk to you they respond if they
don't hear you to say sir repeat that
they banter amongst themselves and
they're all have very unique they're not
just like hoorah military soldiers
generic guys they all have unique
personalities motivations desires and
speech patterns and of course to that
end we have our crazy awesome cast Wil
Wheaton Ashly Burch Laura Bailey Yuri
Lowenthal Kerr and Strassman
Rachel Roberts and the list goes on
we're so excited to record we record in
July super psyched to work with those
guys that's gonna be awesome I'm super
stoked for this game and I will be
picking this up myself if you want to
see all the rest of it or any mega booth
