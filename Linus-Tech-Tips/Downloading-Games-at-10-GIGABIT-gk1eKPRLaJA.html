games to download is annoying enough to
start with but when there are multiple
people in the house or office and
everyone wants to grab a hot new title
at the same time you can run into some
serious bottlenecking so we set out to
solve that problem once and for all
without just spending more money on a
faster internet connection and now
well not quite now Jake's fixing it but
soon everyone in this building will be
able to download games from services
like Steam at full speed and I'm gonna
show you guys how after Jake fixes the
machine and I tell you about Corsairs
next generation strafe mark to keyboard
it features a variety of Cherry MX RGB
key switches and eight megabytes of
on-board profile storage check it out at
the link below
if you've been to an organised land
event recently you were probably wow by
game download speeds that seem like they
were from the future or something but
unless it was Dreamhack 2018 the events
internet speed is probably nowhere near
enough to offer those kinds of speeds -
even just a couple of people so how do
they do it great question and one that
can be both simple and complicated to
answer so in short those insane speeds
are thanks to the event having something
called a caching server basically when a
game is first downloaded on the network
instead of the files just going straight
to the downloaders drive like let's say
this laptop that used to be here but
instead I'll use this hard drive as a
prop instead of them just going straight
to this drive they are first saved to a
separate machine and then kind of
relayed to the user so then the next
time someone wants to download that same
game let's say to this other hard drive
instead of pulling it off of steam or
you play directly it'll save a ton of
bandwidth to the outside Internet by
grabbing it off of that same server this
will help keep latency down for all of
the gamers that are sharing that same
connection so the concept is simple but
when you get into sending up nginx DNS
forwarding dealing with HTTPS and
worrying about when to clear the cache
the actual deployment can get pretty
confusing now thankfully for us there
are a ton of different solutions that
mostly revolve around the same built in
nginx caching solution with the most
up-to-date being yeah appropriately
named steam cache
it's pre compiled for docker making it
quick to set up and despite its name
there's actually a version of it that
supports steam origin Riot Games
battlenet frontier Launchpad you play
and even Windows Update so it's perfect
for your next land or even general home
use because I mean who needs epic games
launch anyway right
Yeah right so let's get started on
exactly how it works then shall we for
most people
standard one gigabit networking along
with a couple of along with a couple of
raid zero to hard drives will be more
than sufficient but come on you guys
know how we do so we wanted to plan to
allow every single writer here in the
office to download games at the same
time so that would be about one gigabyte
per second of sequential read speeds now
that's child's play for today's high-end
nvme SSDs like this one but since we
also need capacity and that's not what
you're gonna get from a single opt-in
drive we decided on six raid 0 480 gig
SATA SSDs from corsair that we pulled
out of that dual machine build rip rip
in peices now it should be noted that a
single drive failure here would result
in a complete loss of all the data on
the array but it doesn't really matter
since this server is not
mission-critical all it's doing is
caching readily available games and
updates we could easily throw a new
drive in and redownload it all the other
key specs of our system are at 64 gigs
of DDR 4 RAM lots of RAM let's the
server cache files in memory for quicker
transfers and a 10 gigabit network card
so remember even though we want to
download from the server at one gigabit
we want multiple people to be able to do
that at the same time so this one needs
a bigger pipe now we're using an X 540 T
2 but that's kind of older because we
had it lying around they're actually
cheaper options these days from a quanta
and a soos so then now that we have a
server primed for caching we can get
back to the software side of things as I
mentioned earlier steam cash comes in
the form of a docker container which is
kind of like a virtual machine but
instead of emulating the entire
operating system then with the specific
software that we need on top of that
docker
can run specific software as if
on its OS without running an entire
separate OS making it a lot more
efficient especially if you need to run
multiple instances of the same software
and we will need to do that since each
different service that needs cashing
steam origin battlenet etc will run in
its own instance now we know all of that
was a gross oversimplification so we're
actually gonna link a video below with a
better explanation of docker if you're
into that docker can run on both Linux
and Windows but the windows version has
to actually virtualize linux kernel on
top of Windows so we're gonna stick with
Linux we went with a bun to desktop
eighteen point oh four because we love
reading but hurt comments from the arch
and mint fanboys just kidding love you
guys
but don't worry the guide that we're
gonna have linked below will work on
pretty much any flavor of Linux that you
like now our first step is to get docker
up and running once you have it make
sure that you run your docker commands
either with sudo or by adding your user
to the docker group do not run any of
this as root please then for our
installation we want to cache all of the
services that we use on a regular basis
here at the office which means that
we're going to need six static IPS one
for each of them since this OS has a
graphical interface it's actually super
easy to set up our ip's we just need to
navigate to network settings and enter
them
wha-bam wha-bam just like that I type
pretty fast now we can start each of the
caching docker containers one by one and
then steam cache DNS which will forward
all of the URLs that need caching to our
server instead of the world wide web
then I mean don't worry then if
something isn't on our server it won't
just fail if the content isn't cached
yet it will then get downloaded to the
caching server and be forwarded to the
downloader seamlessly cool right so
theoretically then we should be good to
start downloading some games right not
quite so we need to set the cache IP as
DNS on all the systems we want to use
right okay so keep in mind that if you
intend to run a solution like this long
term it's a lot more
elegant to set your primary DNS on your
router to the IP of your caching server
instead of setting up the DNS settings
on a computer by computer basis
don't worry any unrelated traffic will
go to the usual location okay so we're
ready so here's the caching server we've
got our Diagnostics panel running and
all that and then we've got actually a
couple of test victims so first up we've
got this guy one of Jake's test benches
and we're just gonna do a quick sanity
check make sure everything's working
this is actually a 10 gig client with an
intel octane drive as its boot so go
ahead and hit that I want to hit it at
the same time as you okay three eight
two one go oh boy Brandon you're gonna
have to get here on the run 23 seconds
here well you got this I'm at two
hundred Meg's I'm coming down at 320
Meg's a second sir you're at what - 23
to 23 to 30 - 50
oh wow 300
are you done the game yet since the win
five seconds two and done go check go
check it kids will be done - so we don't
even have to see the actual speed wonder
what the fat is disgusting okay so we
peaked out at seven point two gigabit
seven point two gigabit yeah from the
surf show it show Brandon seven point Q
so that was the peak seven point two and
then it was kind of averaged around six
there's another one right there
dang flab it doesn't say all right for
lulz I'm just gonna do pup G and see if
that works
oh yeah it is yes so with games like pub
G where there's a lot of compression
yeah you're limited by your computer so
if we look at the cores of this system
so this is a nine you know you don't
have a huge amount of single-threaded
performance so steam will only use a
certain amount of cores and it won't
bypass that so you'll see us and so
we're capped out by our CPU right now
yeah decompressing not by our surface if
you see here there's two full cores that
are being utilized
I think it's normally three or four that
it'll use man
and then past that it won't use anymore
to not interrupt the rest of your system
right and I think it's more optimized
for like four to eight core systems 16
core is a little too much for steam so
it's a less impressive demo but it's
definitely our best-case scenario and
that means that we could have five
systems yeah hitting it at this
currently seven now based on what we saw
there
so I guess conclusion time then this may
not be a solution for the everyday gamer
like many people will only ever download
each game play at once then delete it
and never download it again and it's a
lot more user friendly to just use steam
zone backup feature to an as if there's
something that you you know think
occasionally you might want to
redownload but if you have a bunch of
gaming aficionados in the house or if
you help run a local land gaming
organization we would definitely
recommend giving it a shot especially if
you have an old computer lying around
that's just waiting to be given a new
purpose speaking of just waiting what
are you waiting for

tips in that how did you hear about us
section we're gonna have that linked
below so thanks for watching guys just
like or like check out our other videos
oh wait this is my tech quickie outro
crap also get subscribed we have merch
and let us know if you want to see a
follow up to this video where instead of
like a jank tastic like rat's nest of
SSDs in the back of a regular tower yeah
and Jake's water cooled test bench if
you want to see us like set this up
properly let get like every steam in
origin game possible cashed onto it and
do some cool down
maybe we should do like a land center oh
I do pretty this would be perfect for
that yeah we might need more networking
though hmm
maybe I see us take it to the next level
