offer a rudimentary protection for your
device from short drops and scratches in
your pocket those cost a few bucks there
are phone cases out there that do that
and look kind of cool I'm partial to the
ones that look like game boys or nest
controllers on the back those cost a few
bucks more moving up in price we've got
ones with enhanced functionality more
durability built in card wallets bottle
openers or multi tools you know everyday
stuff but hold on a second Linus I mean
sure some of those cost over $100 but
arguably that's useful stuff why is it
in this segment it's not today's
featured product is the result of my
effort to find the lowest utility to
cost ratio iPhone case I possibly could
on amazon.ca and so I present to you the
shop ready lumen OSIS handcrafted luxury
bling Swarovski crystals sparkling full
glitter rhinestones back snap on
protective hard case cover for iPhone 6s
by play bling a 250 US dollar iPhone
case covered in crystals
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description so the price is
unmistakably over a hundred dollars but
how do you prove that something is
useless or that it's a very poor value
in the case of the thousand dollar HDMI
cable from the last episode which you
can check out here by the way I reviewed
the manufacturers claims about the value
of the product like noticeably better
sound and video quality then tested it
at very high data rates against a
generic cable and observed that there
was not indeed any discernible or
measurable difference easy so let's take
the same approach here by finding the
actual manufacturers product page where
the price is a still outlandish but at
least significantly lower two hundred
and thirty-five US dollars so they're
apparently Swarovski crystals which in
case you were wondering means glass in
the shape of crystals made by a company
in Austria apparently Eastern Europeans
are good at glass crystal work who knew
nothing to do with usefulness though
other benefits of this fine product
include each crystal being 100% handset
by a skilled craftsman if there any
women working on them I'm throwing a fit
just saying that it contains over 1,000
crystals and that the adhesive glue is
RoHS compliant well I'm not much of a
glue expert hey you know get out of here
but I did manage to count the crystals
and there are indeed over a thousand of
them so full marks there although none
of that has anything to do with
usefulness okay it's presented in a
premium gift set this is a little
debatable since the packaging is almost
as horrible as the gigantic paper
warning about never taking the case off
once it's installed in case all the
rhinestones start falling off and
finally it is perfect for parties and
balls again I'm hardly a leading
authority on party-going having ever
been invited to one and my attempts to
use it on my balls eclipsed all other
failures I have ever broadcast on this
show
so then given that the manufacturer
actually makes no claims whatsoever
about the items utility I don't really
have to prove that it's useless I only
have to prove that I can get something
equally useless for less time for a
field trip to the dollar store God Wow
everything is about 25 fishing supplies
shockingly few jewels in the hair
accessories Department this has promised
still no jewels a million hair bands and
no jewels starting to lose hope
damn I overpaid for my case maybe these
are a boo those are like gel arts across
aisle oh we're close I definitely gotta
have some of these rock on I have
painstakingly extracted all the hematite
beads hmm acrylic crystals you have got
to be kidding me
this looks easier so there we have it
everything I need to recreate the
functionality of this case for under $50
u.s.
so I need you to evaluate two things for
me on a scale out of 10 oh my god Wow
five out of ten I don't okay I'll be
right back
six I give it a one I think this is like
maybe worse seven out of ten I get that
like a like an eight yeah five and a
half zero so then here's the bottom line
for a fifth of the price and about 40
minutes
you can achieve the same goal of looking
like a tool who is in your 20s or 30s
and still wants to play princess dress
up on the weekend and you can do this
without also looking like you have more
money in your wallet then sense in your
head because remember there is expensive
crap that you can buy if you just have
money burning a hole in your pocket that
actually retains its value so maybe look
into that so you can look like a baller
without also looking like an idiot
speaking of looking like an idiot
do you ever browse anything online that
would make you look kind of dumb or kind
of like a weirdo well tunnel bears got
you covered because tunnel there doesn't
let your internet provider track your
web browsing in fact it's the simple VPN
app that makes it easy to browse
privately and enjoy a more open Internet
in general with tunnel bear turned on
your Wi-Fi connection does Orwell's
regular in a connection it's all
Internet to things one your connection
will get encrypted with AES 256-bit
encryption and two it will appear and
you can select any of 20 different
countries that you want to the services
and websites that you use online as
though you are a completely different
well fully anonymized person in a
completely different country tunnel
there has a top rated privacy policy and
does not log your activity you know why
tunnel bear doesn't log activity because
bears live in the forest that's their
habitat man and you can try it for free
with five hundred megabytes and no
credit card required if you choose to
get an unlimited
a plan you can actually save 10% by
gonna tunnel bear comm /l tt linked in
