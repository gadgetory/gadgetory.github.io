brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries so guys we're here in
the Hall of NVIDIA pcs where we've got a
bunch of games that they're showcasing a
lot of these are current games so
technologies like TxAA physics 3d vision
all that stuff it's being shown off here
so there's Splinter Cell blacklist
there's Hawking there's ex pawn the
Bureau whole bunch of really cool stuff
I heard a little bird tell me that there
might be something to do with that net
Arkham origins now I don't know
something something about that sort of
later on in the show so guys stay tuned
for that because much like the previous
Batman's I'm expecting this one to
feature pretty much the entire slew of
Nvidia gaming technologies so lo and
behold Nvidia shield so we've got
Dishonored Borderlands 2 Batman Arkham
City and elderscrolls v skyrim all being
streamed to shield gamers who are here
demoing the device for the first time so
there's a whole bunch of Falken
northwest gaming machines powering these
and then the routers are obviously
hidden but here maybe we can get one of
these gamers to give us their
impressions I'm blindsiding you here man
how's the latency on this latency what
does that mean the latency would refer
to like do you feel like you're playing
wirelessly off of another device or does
it just feel like you're playing on it
well I feel like I'm just playing on it
well because it's just it just connects
to the monitor
so so it's really cool the graphics are
great especially when you put it on the
TV it looks almost the same there's no
like pixel distortion or anything
compared to that fantastic so there you
go guys he had no idea that was coming
that was definitely spur of the moment
I'm personally since I already have a
shield more interested in these Nvidia
beanbag chairs these things are awesome
look at this I definitely need to get my
hands on a couple of these somehow I
mean I think the coolest thing about
that is that a completely non-technical
person who doesn't even understand that
it's not the shield streaming to the TV
or the computer it's the other way
around
he has no idea that it's just like
wirelessly beaming an h.264 encoded
video stream to the shield itself is
phenomenally cool because it speaks to
the seamlessness of the experience I
mean us nerds are gonna benchmark it and
we're gonna measure the latency and
we're gonna do this and we're gonna do
that but when it comes to an actual
gamer sitting in a beanbag chair
enjoying the game that's the experience
very cool so we're chilling on the couch
with Brett from Nvidia it looks like the
very robust Wi-Fi solution that's built
in to shield is capable of doing more
than just streaming games from your PC
so what have you got running here right
now this is skiing Fred this is one of
our titles we have on Tegra zone so
we're actually showing here on shield
skiing skiing Fred being watched you
stream to this TV over here the only fat
core that I have on this device is just
for power it's streaming to that dongle
over there over Wi-Fi direct over a
meerkats technology so as you can see I
can take my shield on the go come home
cookies throw this up with a put touch
of a button up onto the screen and put
all my favorite Android games watch
movies Netflix everything onto the TV so
using Wi-Fi basically the idea is now
you can play PC games on this or you can
play Android games on that and the whole
thing just is
it's it's an all-in-one entertainment
console nobody knows what anything does
anymore it kind of does everything it
escapes absolutely crazy so thank you
very much for showing us this checking
this out guys don't miss any of our PAX
Prime 2013 coverage huge thanks to our
sponsors Western Digital Intel and
SteelSeries for allowing us to be here
and thanks again for showing us this
