brought to you by western digital Intel
and steel series so guys were here in
the hall of nvidia pcs where we've got a
bunch of games that they're showcasing a
lot of these are current games so
technologies like txa a physics 3d
vision all that stuff it's being shown
off here so there's splinter cell
blacklist there's Hawking fares X pawn
the bureau whole bunch of really cool
stuff I heard a little bird tell me that
there might be something to do with that
net Arkham origins now I don't know
something something about that sort of
later on in the show so guys stay tuned
for that because much like the previous
Batman's I'm expecting this one to
feature pretty much the entire slew of
nvidia gaming technologies so lo and
behold Nvidia shield so we've got
dishonored borderlands 2 batman arkham
city and elder scrolls 5 skyrim all
being streamed to shield gamers who are
here demoing the device for the first
time so there's a whole bunch of Falcon
Northwest gaming machines powering these
and then the routers are obviously
hidden but here maybe we can get one of
these gamers to give us their
impressions I'm blindsiding you here man
how's the latency on this ah latency
what does that mean the latency would
refer to like do you feel like you're
playing wirelessly off of another device
or does it just feel like you're playing
on it well I feel like I'm just playing
on it well because it's just it just
connects to the monitors but it so this
is the console so it's really cool the
graphics are great especially when you
put it on the TV it looks almost the
same there's no like pixel distortion or
anything we compared to that fantastic
so there you go guys he had no idea that
was coming that was definitely spur of
the moment I'm personally since I
already have a shield more interested in
these nvidia beanbag chairs these things
are awesome look at this I definitely
need to get my hands on a couple of
these
I mean I think the coolest thing about
that is that a completely non technical
person who doesn't even understand that
it's not the shield streaming to the TV
or the computer it's the other way
around he has no idea that it's just
like wirelessly beaming at age 2 64
encoded video stream to the shield
itself is phenomenally cool because it
speaks to the seamlessness of the
experience I mean US nerds are going to
benchmark it and we're going to measure
the latency and we're going to do this
and we're going to do that but when it
comes to an actual gamer sitting in a
bean bag chair enjoying the game that's
the experience very cool so we're
chillin on the couch with Brett from
Nvidia it looks like the very robust
Wi-Fi solution that's built into shield
is capable of doing more than just
streaming games from your PC so what
have you got running here right now this
is skiing Fred this is one of our titles
we have on Tigers own so we're actually
showing here on shield skiing skiing
Fred being washing strange this TV over
here they look or that I have on this
device is just for power it's streaming
to that dongle over there over Wi-Fi
direct of a meerkats technology so as
you can see I can take my shield on the
go come home cookies throw this up with
a put touch of a button up onto the
screen and play all my favorite android
games watch movies Netflix everything
onto the TV so using Wi-Fi basically the
idea is now you can play PC games on
this or you can play android games on
that and the whole thing just is it's
it's an all-in-one entertainment console
nobody knows what anything does anymore
it kind of does everything it escapes
absolutely crazy so thank you very much
for showing us this checking this out
guys don't miss any of our pax prime
2013 coverage huge thanks to our
sponsors western digital Intel and
steelseries for allowing us to be here
