serves a couple of purposes so for one
we're going to have a look at the
Samsung PDP 59 inch series 6 6500 plasma
displays so this is a 59 inch but check
this out so they're calling this plasma
plus one because due to the slim bezel
design of this particular plasma TV
samsung figures you get about an extra
inch out of it
so 59 inch actually turns into a 60 inch
viewable display one thing I noticed
about the plasma display so we're
actually in the brand-new NCIX location
if you and I just do a quick count
around so this is going to be for
Samsung showcases so you can see we've
got a lot of seven some TVs and we're
gonna happen definitely unbox and check
out for you guys here one thing I've
noticed about the plasma boxes is that
they come in significantly wider boxes
so I guess that's to prevent any damage
from appearing to the panel if it falls
over on its side seems like it's a
little bit more fragile than LCD in that
way so the first thing we find when we
open it up is the mount so this is going
to allow us to I'm just gonna put this
on that little pillar here so this is
going to allow us to mount the actual
panel to the stem there's also a little
thing in there but presumably how to do
it
alright let's take out some of these
packing materials so this display is
actually good
on the other side of the room I'm
opening it in front of this backdrop
which is actually going to be for an LCD
display although most of the general
advantages and features and specs are
going to be pretty similar it's about 3d
it's got samsung's Smart TV features
which allow you to watch youtube videos
browse Twitter all of that good stuff on
this particular display we've got a
great-looking brushed aluminum base here
although for me the base of the TV has
never been a huge sticking point if you
are putting this somewhere where the
base will be a factor because your mind
you can't even actually see it if you're
putting us somewhere where the base will
be a factor that you're gonna want it to
look pretty nice so I think they
definitely achieve that so I'm gonna go
ahead and what else we got in here in
terms of accessories look I think this
boxes I could like to pick myself in
there and even I can't even reach down
to the TV so I'm going to be removing
the plasma display being careful a lot
to not to lay it down flat or turn it
upside down
and we'd have to do this off-camera with
the help of cameramen because I can't do
it myself it's really big and really
Kennedy TV's been extracted but due to
my short stature and short on I still
can't get the app the mobile accessories
up yeah this is what it takes this is
now dedicated I am to unboxing I will
even get inside the box if that is what
is required of me so inside this bag you
wiII find a bunch of interesting stuff
including look at that they've got an
adapter for component input honestly new
stuff like this you're not really gonna
want to be using component input but if
you so require then you have at least
the option these look like fairly thin
cables and for an analogue signal that
does matter but there you go so that's
kind of your backup there this is one of
those interference reduction doohickeys
with the magnets and the whatnots so I'm
gonna go ahead and presume that's for
power cord or something along those
lines okay
warranty information it is a one-year
for all plasmas labor and parts okay but
first we got Samsung Smart TV so here's
some accessories including hopefully in
English somewhere okay well I'll do my
best here hold on oh maybe this is
English yeah there we go so a Skype TV
camera you got a wireless LAN adapter
wireless router installation solution
ultra slim wall mount oh that's kind of
cool
okay neat as well as 3d glasses wide
variety of 3d glasses including those
lightweight ones that we have on display
at our new Vancouver store that are
actually quite comfortable compared to
other 3d glasses some safety
instructions okay we got a cleaning
cloth we got another one of those
interference traductor doohickeys we got
a couple triple-a batteries and then we
have the Samsung remote so this one
doesn't come with the party remote I
believe that's reserved for some of the
very high-end models so this looks a
very similar to the remote that I have
for my TV so give me a sec here guys I'm
gonna climb out of this box and then
we'll get
TV assembled here so we're ready for the
unveiling of the TV itself which member
mannan helped me get the machine ear
position this rang tonight it opened up
and there we have it a lot gets sent
about plasma versus style CD and
something that there seems to also be a
ton of confusion about is LCD vs. LED I
just want to clarify with you guys a
little bit that LED and LCD are the same
thing it's just a different backlight
technology that is going behind the LCD
panel so an LCD is typically an LCD
panel that the cathode back way and then
an LED TV is an LCD panel with LEDs
behind it so this is a plasma TV which
means neither those are factors in the
design of this particular TV so
advantages some disadvantages as a
platform the advantage is the very
responsive screen compared to your
typical large format LCD another
advantage is cost plasma panels tend to
be in less expensive than equivalent LCD
or LED panels quite slim due to the
technology involved so with typically
with cathode backlit LED that's the I'm
doing I'm getting confused with Catholic
backlit LCD
a little bit more space behind plasmas
and the leading backlit LCD s don't have
that disadvantage however the plasmas
there is also the risk of a slightly
less satisfying image quality in a less
than completely dark room so if you guys
want to see them side-by-side the best
thing to do is going to be to come to
the new NCIX store in aberdeen mall once
it opens i in the next couple weeks here
and check out all the tvs yourselves did
you give me a second off camera what i'm
gonna do is i'm going to throw it on the
stand and then i'll give you guys a
chance to check out all the input
notebooks and all that good stuff so
here we go back we've got it unveiled
for the most part installing this fan
took us about two minutes so we just you
take that back piece actually here if
you want to come around and have a look
at the back from the other side so you
take this bracket right here this guy
you just keep the TV sitting upright and
you can actually slide it into place
without even picking up the TV at all so
then you screw on the four screws here
then you just position the base
correctly somewhere wherever you want to
put it you lower the entire TV down it
balances and then you just put in the
four screws here oh wait actually that's
not really you're supposed to do it
right you're supposed to put this onto
here first that way you can put in all
four screws I only put in two screws but
it seems to be okay it's not going
anywhere for now bear in mind I mean the
way that I would be mounting a TV like
this if I'm installing it in my home is
using a wall mount anyway it's so slim
you might as well take advantage of all
the space you have in your room because
16 inch screen you're going to need some
distance from it so it does have the
nice amount of holes here so let's go
ahead and have a look at what we've got
for inputs and outputs we've got USB 1 &amp;amp;
2 one of these is for a hard drive
remember this is a smart TV so you've
got all those advanced features built in
digital audio out that's optical right
there we've got four HDMI ins including
one that is optimized for DVI so if you
have a PC for example you might want to
use it for that one as well as PC audio
and just using your typical standard
headphone jack type interface down here
we've also got VGA in your antenna in
and then down here we've got that
composite adapter dude as well as our
land port and e.x link so that pretty
covers it for the back so the cameraman
sort of brought to my attention that
while I did say that plasma TVs were
less expensive than LED LCD tvs
typically he's like well yeah this is
still a very expensive TV and it's a
good point because you know yeah it is
but it does have all the Smart TV
features and does have 3d support it
also has good look and everything and
it's still cheaper than an equivalent
LED backlit LCD TVs so if you do have a
nice dark room that you're gonna put
your TV in then the plasma is definitely
an option so I thank you guys for
checking out our video of the 6500 class
plasma TV from Samsung so this is a 59
inch TV but it's actually a 60-inch TV
don't forget to subscribe - technics for
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and oh yeah cameraman is probably
raging inside because I haven't
mentioned the brushed aluminum sort of
looking finish brushed metal finish
around the bezel which actually looks
really nice it's a two-tone so it's
black here silver here but they are both
using the same style of finish and then
you've also got good clear plastic
outside so they know I've mentioned it
so cameraman actually expressed some
confusion that our 60-inch Plasma here
was going to be the 3d demo he figured
samsung would probably want to use their
LED LCD TV and sort of one of the points
i brought up to him is that this is
where the plasma TV is going to go on
this time of the store here between E
logo plasmas response times just are an
inherent value of this particular
technology are actually ideal for 3d
versus LCDs which take a little bit
longer to change over from one image to
another which is perfect when you're
trying to show one image to one eye
my name is to the other eye with chatter
glasses so that's probably why Samsung
opted to use this particular plasma
from the 3d demo inside the and it's
gotta accent some showcase here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
