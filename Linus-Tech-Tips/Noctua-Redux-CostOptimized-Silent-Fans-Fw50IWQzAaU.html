time since we've covered a new lineup of
fans from not two ah but there's nothing
I can do about the fact that they
launched two whole lineups at the same
time if there were I'd have used my
awesome powers to get all this stuff
released years ago anyway last time was
the water and dust resistant all-black
top-of-the-line and very expensive
industrial PPC lineup and this time
we've got the products that some of you
might actually be able to afford this is
the Redux lineup with its factory tuning
and data center DNA and Intel 730 series
SSD is an amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts now with the
redox line Noctua has at least partially
addressed the two biggest complaints
that exist about the regular PC cooling
fans number one is the price Redux fans
come in basic cost-effective packaging
and instead of including accessories
like adapter cables and anti-vibration
rubber mounts they ship with just a fan
and four mounting screws in the box
number two is the color compared to not
two as traditional brown and tan look
redox fans use a muted two-tone gray
color scheme that should be much much
less polarizing so what else is
different
well the biggest difference between Knox
was regular retail fans on the redux
lineup is basically time travel you
still get a six year warranty and
premium build quality but instead of
using the latest designs like the NFF 12
and nfa 14 Redux lineup products are a
generation or two back in terms of
Technology and features and you also
don't get the same variety in the models
with only one blade design available in
each size 80 millimeter 92 millimeter
120 millimeter and 140 millimeter
although the 140 millimeter version is
available with either around or a square
frame okay so that's great more
affordable not to offend this is super
exciting right Linus actually overall
I'd say my reaction to the Redux series
right now could be best described as a
little bit disappointed it feels like
knock to a carefully considered the
they were getting from their customers
and then didn't quite fully addressed
them to avoid cannibalizing sales of
their existing products on its own the
two-tone raised color scheme is
definitely way better than the
traditional brown and tan one but it
still doesn't really match anything and
you don't get that I mean for better or
for worse but naktu has done over the
last few years is they've built up that
status symbol of not to offends and how
they look and you know it's like
Buckley's it tastes awful but it works
that kind of thing so you don't get that
either and on top of that at least at
the time of making this video the
product lineup is so narrow that only a
handful of pcs could be properly
optimized using all redux fans Noctua
does address all the main sizes and they
let you choose between DC or PWM control
for most models but a couple of key
things are missing here for me there's
no air flow optimized 140 millimeter
model something I don't really care
about that much but much more
importantly they didn't include a
pressure optimized 120 millimeter model
they could have done this the NFP 12 is
a last gen design and would have made
the redux lineup something I could
wholeheartedly recommend while still
giving the braun fans a small
performance advantage but as it is our
only option is the s12 which is still a
good fan and very silent in free-flowing
situations but quite frankly isn't very
good against a restrictive grill heat
sink or radiator so there it is Noctua I
still love you but I'm a little bit
disappointed in these the quality might
be great they might still have the six
year warranty and all that stuff that I
love so much about your products but
they still won't look great in my system
they're still pretty expensive compared
to other fans and I don't feel like I
can properly equip my system I mean this
is the big one I don't feel like I can
properly equip my system with them
because my only 120 millimeter option
may be quiet but it will perform poorly
in many situations and I just can't
recommend cutting out your rig with
Redux series fans until there is a
pressure optimised 120 millimeter model
although I guess the positive take away
from all of this is that all Noctua has
to do to
completely fixed the redox lineup for me
is bring out one more model so if
there's an NF p12 Redux by the time you
watch this video then consider my main
complaint resolved otherwise all those
things I just said I won't make you sit
through them again thank you guys very
much for watching my video on not to was
Redux series of fans like the video if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it leave a comment letting me know what
you think am I overreacting about this
does it matter to you tell me what you
think of the Redux series I desperately
want to know because my opinion is just
my opinion and then I think there are
other things I say right head over to
the video description where you can find
links to the Linus tech tips support
thing or you can buy a t-shirt give us a
monthly contribution or change your
amazon bookmark to one that gives us an
