somehow I've never even been to what is
arguably the electronics manufacturing
capital of the world Shenzhen China
so when oneplus offered to sponsor us
behind the scenes for a close-up look at
their production lines for the one plus
six I couldn't resist
the first line behind me here is
completely focused on building the
screen assembly which includes the OLED
panel the digitizer and the glass front
and the chassis the oneplus six uses a
sandwich style construction with an
aluminum mid plate and then a separate
glass backplate this first station here
after earpiece speaker grille
installation is dedicated just to
inspecting the chassis that are shipped
here from Foxconn by the way don't be
surprised if you buy from someone like
oneplus and some of the components come
from Foxconn their factories make pretty
much everything but it's down to one
plus to control the quality of the user
experience so this guy right here is
checking every single unit to ensure
that it meets their standard and he's
really picky so a tiny imperfection like
this which is very hard for us to even
capture with an 8k camera will result in
this unit being sent back for a refund
now the defect rate for a part like this
is around 0.3 percent meaning that it's
not a huge issue on the surface but
think about it if a phone requires let's
say six major components and each of
them is bad point three percent of the
time then even if everything else goes
perfectly oneplus could end up building
two out of every hundred of their phones
with some kind of imperfection totally
unacceptable
next the chassis and the display
assembly get fed into opposite sides of
the glue applicator machine right here
it uses machine vision to precisely
align them then it applies a special
glue and then they get left in a
compression device for three hours while
the glue cures once these get opened up
the excess glue gets scraped away at
this station here then the USB port and
the vibration motor go in after which
wait hold on a minute
to war glue scraping stations okay so
one plus is currently at a stage of
production called Pvt that actually
means that every single phone you see
here today is going to end up recycled
at some point and they will produce
anywhere from hundreds to even thousands
of phones during Pvt in an effort to get
things streamlined before they go to
mass production and so as part of this
process they found out that there was a
15% chance that glue would seep out
again at this stage right gear so in the
future they might be able to eliminate
these stations this whole thing is a
constantly evolving process from here
the assembled displays and Chafee's get
run through a series of test patterns to
ensure some basic functionality so under
this station we find yet again more
trays full of rejected parts with flaws
both big and very very small
finally some protective covers get
applied and the whole thing gets carted
off to storage
here we're getting our first look at the
rear panel as the rear camera covers and
the fingerprint sensor get placed now
the fingerprint sensor is going to be
exposed to the user so it gets precisely
aligned by machine before being pressed
into place
now this next station here is another
great example of the growing pains that
you go through with a new device you see
this little sticker pad here they had to
add this to the rear cover because a
taller portion of the PCB runs here now
they can probably revise this sort of
thing in the future so this speaker
might not be necessary forever but for
now some extra protection seems prudent
the back cover is now ready and it's
actually gonna jump across the line
where we'll pick up with it later on
batteries get checked here and then they
do get passed across the u-shaped
production line leading us to the
beating heart and the pretty face of
every modern flagship phone the
mainboard
excuse me complete with snapdragon 845
processors and the rear camera which in
this case is a dual 16 plus 20 megapixel
affair the completed chassis and the
display from before those actually join
us here now it's time for some
rapid-fire component installation it's
basically like building a little tiny PC
so we've got ambient sensor placement
the front camera then at a single
station right here in goes the earpiece
speaker the headphone jack and a
daughter board then after that we've got
weight really four people it takes four
people to install and cable managed to
dinky little RF cables well actually yes
it does because of the importance of
this step these connectors in here are
very fragile and the placement and
these wires is imperative to the
functionality of the phone after the
ribbon cables go in for the daughter
board right behind me
this protective cover right here for it
goes in almost entirely automatically
now precise alignment here is critical
because even though oneplus doesn't
advertise it the bottom of the phone by
the main loudspeaker here actually has
similar waterproofing to all their
flagship devices this has apparently
been true since the 5 so it doesn't mean
that one plus is going to warranty you
if the water damage sticker turns red
when you send it in but it is nice to
have that little bit of peace of mind
this station here is all about
identifying process and supply chain
issues every major component of the
phone has a QR code that gets scanned
into their system here and then stored
onboard the phone so that oneplus can
quickly track failures in the field back
to the component supplier assembly line
and even the QC staff that led it
through then we get a quick power on
test to ensure that base functionality
it looks ok followed by the motherboard
cover which goes on in a similar fashion
to the daughter board cover remember how
I promised batteries would be joining us
from across the aisle here they are so
they go into the phone here followed by
another computerized inspection machine
where my main man here is rocking the
world's greatest footwear and this
trippy machine that aligns the back
panel with the front and then places it
on these two pressors here and then this
little roller doodad ensure that the
back panel is fully adhered and then the
finished phones get a final visual check
to ensure that everything is bleh know
this also includes a little wipe down in
most cases so that's it we're done right
so why isn't this video over well you
guys remember how I promised that over a
hundred people would touch one of these
before it left the factory this is only
like 70 ish so after software it gets
loaded every device gets a special code
entered into its numpad to enter testing
mode and then goes through a shockingly
thorough QA screening process so at
stage 1 they test the flash with this
little black box here then they record a
video while the phone is sitting in a
mechanical shaker to ensure that its
image stabilization is working as
expected stage 2 has testers snapping a
photo for comparison against a reference
image that is stored in the QA software
and then stage 3 actually lifts up the
phone against this little metal barrier
here to ensure that the proximity sensor
is working as intended Stage four checks
autofocus on both cameras by moving the
phone back and forth from a target while
Stage five screens for dead pixels on
the camera sensor or dust under the
cover at Stage six every phone goes into
a little mini RF chamber for GPS and
Wi-Fi testing and then at Stage seven
antenna operation is verified but we are
far from done so one plus actually
started pre-installing screen protectors
on their phones to protect against
shipping breakage on the oneplus X a few
years ago and this has continued ever
since so this goes on right here then we
got to move over to the other side of
the line this guy's not just chilling
and listening to music he's actually
making sure that the headphone jack when
it's plugged in or unplugged behaves
correctly and then his partner here is
making sure that the RGB indicator LED
and stream brightness control are
functioning normally the microphone and
speaker are both tested in here to
ensure that they meet spec this
apparently has the highest failure rate
on finished devices at about one in a
thousand
if the speaker is misaligned or really
if the device fails any of these tests
it will get sent for disassembly for
them to try again all right almost done
here just five more stations so here
both the selfie and the rear camera get
checked again this time by a human for
any weirdness that the automated tests
might have missed a fun story oneplus
actually ran into some customer
complaints people thought that their
phones were refurbished because they had
the pictures these guys were taking in
the factory on them no it's fine they
just forgot to wipe them no big deal
moving right over here the G sensor gets
checked by this trippy little rotating
table and NFC functionality is verified
both normal functionality and high speed
dash charging functionality are checked
here and then this machine uses infrared
depth sensing to ensure that the
curvature of the back of the phone is to
spec bringing us finally to one more
visual inspection and wipe down before
the finished phones are placed in
protective sleeves and prepared to be
sent to packaging so each one of these
just to give you guys some idea of the
volume here each one of these contains
about 50 phones completely ready to go
oh I don't know where I got this from
the environmental stress room up
presumably that's what that says I have
no way of knowing is not as impressive
to look at but it's really important so
they've got a number of different
chambers in here ones that are designed
to rapidly increase and decrease
temperature from 75 all the way to minus
40 for up to a week at a time ones that
are designed to deliver very high
temperatures at 95% humidity for up to
500 hours at a time and they've got this
rain drop test which isn't actually
running right now but we can open it up
they would expect a phone under this
shower for a hundred hours to function
normally after a few days of dry out
time dang but it's not as outright
impressive as room number two where they
do one meter 1.5 meter and 1 point 8
meter drop tests onto a slab of marble
with a QA technician checking the
phone's functionality Oh
after each fall so they do each side of
the phone 2 times and they accept 10%
cracked screens but they expect the
entire rest of the phone's functionality
including the camera to remain
unimpacted haha so to speak by this type
of torture I mean that seems reasonable
enough to me I mean most people would
have to be like walking around like this
with a phone on their head to drop it
from 1.8 meters all the time and that
one isn't even the most strenuous test
in this room this tumbler right here
check this out
oh you hear that this guy drops up to
four phones one meter in any orientation
a total of a hundred and fifty times now
one plus does expect some aesthetic
damage here but once again more than 10
percent cracked screens means it is back
to the drawing board oh that's hard to
listen to we saved the best for last
this is the endurance lab so in room one
we found all kinds of treats this guy
right here can press on the USBC and
headphone jacks and remove and insert
cables 10,000 times after that stress
test the phone will be taken out
disassembled and inspected for
structural damage that could be
reinforced in future designs this guy
right here is a mechanical but that puts
25 kilograms of pressure onto the top of
the phone a thousand times this is for
careless people who keep their phone in
their back pocket this one right over
here this one's actually kind of
depressing this is the 10 centimeter
drop tester it works in conjunction with
the edge tester that's over there to
pick up and drop each phone 10,000 times
from the back 10,000 times from the
front then another 2,000 times on each
edge for a total of 28,000 minor drops
they expect the phones to survive this
kind of treatment it's actually kind of
cathartic to watch
so that's pretty much it
