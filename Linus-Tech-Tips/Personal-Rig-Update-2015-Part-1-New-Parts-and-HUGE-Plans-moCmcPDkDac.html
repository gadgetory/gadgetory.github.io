update 2015 where I build a drool-worthy
rig touching it Ren and savoring its
drives while you guys watch and
sometimes press the like button
depending on whether you're into the
whole multi-part video of which this is
definitely one and like whoring thing
which is definitely what I'm doing right
now Corsair delivers real mech art oh
here I have one huh real Necker nothing
with their new strafe mechanical
keyboard featuring genuine German made
Cherry MX key switches click on munch in
to learn more I'm going to move my chin
now just the three for a loop so let's
start with the story so far this is the
final version of personal rig update
2012 which as some of you know took
until 2014 to finish oh that took a long
time
so the highlight points here are 49 60 X
6 core processor GTX Titan we've got oh
L si 9268 a raid card with eight-course
are 120 gig force SSDs running in raid 0
they're actually refurbished drives
although they've held up just fine until
now so I guess what we need to do aside
from just listing components is do a
couple pre update benchmarks to find out
where we're sitting at and where we need
to end up so Cinebench we're looking at
1068 points and then crystal disk mark
just a very rudimentary disk benchmark
whoa we're looking at about 800
megabytes per second read 321 megabytes
per second sequential writes so as you
can see that raid array has degraded a
lot in the last few years since I've
been using it because on most raid
controllers trim functionality is not
supported in raid so the timing is right
for our personal rig update let's have a
look at the new components that are
going to be taking the place of what's
already in here
all right so let's do this whole video
style and actually not upgrading the
graphics card this time around and the
reason for that is quite frankly I don't
gain that much these days and when I do
I'm usually gaming at 720p streaming to
my shield portable so is it tighten
enough for that yeah I think probably so
first up the new platform this is the
rampage 5 extreme that some of you will
recognize from my blue-painted
motherboard guide it used to be red now
it's blue and it is going in the
personal rig also replacing the 49 60 X
is a 59 60 X so I'm adding another two
CPU cores and then I'm sticking with 32
gigs of ram but this time a more subdued
32 gigs of ram no flashing lights or
anything
this is just a kid of Corsair Vengeance
lpx 2400 megahertz
ddr4 so that's what we got for that next
up and this is kind of a funny funny
story huh I have another rampage 5
extreme not because that one is broken
or anything but as you guys may or may
not have noticed I have taken this
heatsink and as soos ROG logo off and I
have actually misplaced it so I will be
frankensteining one off of another board
that Luke used for a build guide and
then I have a very cool finishing touch
because as some of you noticed when I
painted the board the one thing left on
it that was still red was that freaking
glowing logo so I had a buddy of mine
rich suros better known amongst the
modding community folks as Darth Beavis
whip these up for me on his laser
cutting machine which we first witnessed
at mod 24 so check this out he's
actually sent me a variety of different
ones to use and I will be replacing the
stock ROG logo with either a black one
or a blue one depending on how they look
I'm going to try those babies out check
that out then that looks sick so a huge
shout out to Darth Beavis for sending
these little custom pieces over to me
these look absolutely
fantastic and for our next trick yes
this is the piece that I'm really
excited about this is an Intel 750
series 1.2 terabyte PCI Express nvme SSD
it has been a long time since I paid
less than a dollar per gig for those
refurb drives like way back in 2012 or
something like that I want to say it's
been a long time since any SSD has
actually tickled my fancy and made me
want to upgrade to it well this is
finally it
it's an capacity upgrade it's a speed
upgrade and it's a space-saving upgrade
I no longer have to have a whack of SSDs
bolted to the back of my motherboard
tray and the PCI Express card this is
just a simple PCIe gen3 4 X card that is
going to do everything that my previous
bulky setup did and better with trim
support so the performance won't degrade
over time really excited about this one
so I guess that's pretty much it let's
get started
mostly unobstructed access now some of
you might wonder why I went with a
rampage board instead of a WS board like
I did last time around I'm on the record
as being kind of a fan of the whole
no-nonsense
ws board concept the reason is that a
soos opted for whatever reason to put a
ps2 port on the ROG board this time
around and not on the ws board and when
you're troubleshooting something let me
tell you a ps2 port can be an absolute
lifesaver that and the ROG board comes
with a 3 by 3 AC wireless solution
that's actually like pretty friggin fast
so there you go look at this board oh
wait what those LEDs are red I assumed
they were white and that it was just a
red layer in between I think you can
paint LEDs Brandon so I actually have to
plug into the top SATA port here because
I scratched the finish of the paint on
the inside of the connector there I'm
going to have to touch that up a little
bit but other than that there shouldn't
be any other red bits visible with all
the components installed and speaking of
all the components installed there's
actually not that much left to do here
is there let's go get the new SSD yeah
boy oh just like that so very much
performance I shop I wish Intel would
clue in and use black PCBs but if
they're not going to do that then I
guess the heat spreader on the back is
the next best thing so there it is
friends 1.2 terabyte seven
series look at all those flash chips
both sides covered in flash chips I
think the ideal spot for it would
actually be here but the sound card back
in its prior location easy now huh so
that's in I need new thermal compound
where's the backplate Wow
come on post come on post time to
consult the manual what
Thanks manual oh you have got to be
kidding me
okay well there's no signal detected so
it may be broken anyway but I did not
have the monitor plugged in as much as I
want to go back to the drawing board and
paint another motherboard not in the
plan I need this one to work then why'd
you paint it Linus well I don't have to
answer your questions
nobody's fooled Linus you were asking
yourself the question in a different
voice shut up you oh we got stuck there
this time that's okay we're just gonna
take it slow then one at a time come on
computer work with me you gotta at least
give me consistent results here well
maybe if you hadn't painted me Linus
maybe if you just shut up no
okay well it's after 6:00 I'll just have
to keep working on this so significant
progress I figured it out this chip has
a weaksauce memory controller there's
actually nothing wrong with the CPU but
what I didn't realize was that this
motherboard having been used as a test
bench before was configured with XMP
enabled so that chips weak memory
controller didn't like it at all so as
soon as I put another 59 60 X in there
boom all four dims no problem XMP
working all that good stuff so I ran and
found myself a Windows 10 RTM ISO
installed that puppy it looks like they
have brought
back the simple do this later instead of
getting product keys right away and we
are launching Windows 10 get some
benchmarks hey you were started I
actually haven't run Windows 10 yet at
all so this is my first kick at the
proverbial can you know what the last
time I went for gold like on RTM day was
Windows Vista not worked out great so
I'm just gonna go for it like I'm I'm
switching out right there's an even room
for more logos on the front look at all
the logos LightScribe remember that did
anyone ever wants Bernal LightScribe
discs yeah as a desk have you have you
ever done it does it work presumably
they could it could do absolutely
nothing and we'd have never known the
consumer has been played so I'm fairly
sure when batteries bulged that's
considered a bad thing danger of
explosion alright okay well whatever
let's do our let's do our crystal disk
benchmark in the mean time so bad let's
find out just how fast this drive is
whose speed is documented all over the
internet already anyway I don't know why
the control panel won't want though I
just like I just hate that want a brand
new fresh install when you like bork it
up in the middle of like installing
drivers cuz you never know should I go
back and do a fresh format will this
cause problems later or is it probably
fine like is it never gonna rear its
ugly head down the road no way of
knowing alright looking good so we do
have an improvement in CPU performance
we did see this coming a score in 1389
but crystal disk mark the SSD that is
where the real performance improvement
is coming in read speeds in the
neighborhood of in excess of one
gigabyte per second for both sequential
scenarios both read and write and even
4k reads and writes are looking pretty
strong above that read
look a little bit on the low side with
that said there's still got to be some
room for a driver optimization on
Windows 10 here particularly on the
nvidia side where we can't get the
control panel open right now but the
real test for me the thing that drives
me absolutely crazy about this machine
is the boot times so let's go ahead and
shut her down and find out how long she
takes to start up with the new SSD array
or system SSD it's just one SSD now it's
going to write the number to beat is two
minutes here we go here we go here we go
here we go been about 45 seconds so
thanks to not having to wait for this
card to initialize I have reduced my
boot time to less than half of what it
used to be but that is actually not the
end of this project I said this was
going to be a multi-part video and then
I proceeded to do a quick motherboard
swap and it appears to be basically done
appears at first glance to the
inexperienced viewer some of you may
have noticed that this fan is actually
broken so clearly I have not performed
the final upgrade know I will be taking
it to the next level other experienced
viewers may have noticed this in the new
hardware pile that I didn't mention at
all before yes I will be working with
proto case to manufacture a custom new
rackmount computer case to replace my
venerable TJ oh seven I will be moving
both mine and my wife's computers to
rack-mounted cases in a separate room in
order to achieve the ultimate in PC
silence I will be running a single
Thunderbolt cable to each of those
machines to a thunderbolt splitter doc
thing in order to have all of my
peripherals running at the same time and
that will be documented over the next
few parts of personal rig upgrade 2015
but for now I at least
to enjoy the speed of the new hardware
that's going into the machine I may also
throw a graphics card
upgrade into the mix at a later date as
well so in the meantime guys dislike
this video if you thought it sucked you
guys all know where that button is I
know you do but if you like the video go
ahead and like it get subscribe to the
channel and also consider supporting us
by buying a cool t-shirt like the ones
that I usually wear using our affiliate
code to shop on Amazon we even have a
video guide for how to do that now or
even giving us direct monthly
contributions through our community
forum all that stuff helps us out a lot
if you're done doing all that stuff and
you're looking for something else to
watch Luke actually just finished up a
great video on the Intel compute stick
this is kind of the opposite end of the
spectrum but whatever if you're
wondering about what a little tiny baby
beanie computer can do then go ahead and
check that out I'll see you guys later
