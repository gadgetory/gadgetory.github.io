aluminum stand for your smartphone that
even holds tablets up to eight inches
click now to learn more the Tegra note 7
is the second fruit born of invidious
ongoing strategy of well no one else is
going to recognize the greatness of our
processors then damnit we're just going
to build the finished products ourselves
then it is the second handheld device to
use in videos latest in greenest Tegra 4
system-on-a-chip
but unlike the first device that rolled
around one that I happen to be a huge
fan of the Nvidia shield this one is in
a much more conventional form factor the
Tegra note 7 is a plain-jane 7-inch
tablet designed to go head-to-head
against products like the Google Nexus 7
and iPad Mini so first up is the specs
with a 1280 by 800 16 by 10 aspect ratio
display that unfortunately doesn't use
Gorilla Glass Nvidia won't be winning
any awards for who has the best most
retinal display or anything like that
but personally thanks in large part to
the vibrant colors and strong viewing
angles enabled by the IPS display tech
in it I find the screen and pixel
density acceptable if unexceptional at
this size the base and until the LTE one
is available only model weighs 320 grams
features a quad core 1.8 gigahertz Tegra
4 processor with GeForce graphics and
comes with 1 gig of ram single stream
2.4 gigahertz Wireless N and Bluetooth
4.0 and a 15 watt hour battery that
delivers adequate but uninspiring
battery life like shield the note 7 uses
a version of Android that's about as
close to stock as you can get short of
buying a Nexus device and comes with
invidious promise of timely support for
newer versions something that they've
actually done quite well up until this
time with both shield and note 7 running
the latest 4.4.2 as of the time we're
filming this video on the back of the
unit we find a rear facing five
megapixel camera a Tegra note logo and
the partner branding of whoever is
responsible for sale and support of the
device in your region on the top we find
volume control and a microSD slot a
definite plus since the tablet itself is
only available on a 16 gig configuration
and on the left side we've got a lock
button head
phone jack micro HDMI and micro USB for
charging a position that I actually like
since it keeps these connectors out of
the way if you're watching a movie or
playing a game in landscape mode the
right side has a base port and slot for
the included stylus whenever you're not
using it and I guess that's pretty much
it for the physical torso what didn't
video really do here to differentiate
themselves well a couple of things first
up I love the industrial design
I wish Google had never done away with
the textured back of the original Nexus
7 and I'm very pleased to see that make
a return here along with a bit of the
aggressive you know flair that Nvidia
does so well next up is the front-facing
speakers having grown accustomed to an
HTC One over the last year so I find
side-mounted or heaven forbid rear
mounted speakers to be abominable to use
and I can't wait until that unfortunate
design approach goes away entirely third
and this is where things get really
interesting is the stylus NVIDIA hasn't
included a premium digitizer like you
might find in a Wacom tablet I'll be it
at a much higher price but rather an
unusual implementation that offloads
touch controller processing to the low
power fifth core present on all Tegra 4
SOC s this allows this relatively
low-cost tablet I mean for all the
things I've said that haven't sounded
that impressive throughout this video it
is a very inexpensive tablet to ship
with note-taking and drawing apps that
support ignoring your palms and
correctly detecting the pressure you're
putting on the screen with your pen
without an expensive extra screen layer
and a special stylus great features
indeed now with all of that out of the
way though I wasn't really sure how to
review this thing Haggar fours make it
fast ok not quite as fast as the one in
shield with its active cooling mind you
but nothing we haven't seen before
7-inch tablets are swell but nothing we
haven't seen before unless our name is
Luke Luke has never extensively used a
tablet so I figured let's do this I hand
it to Luke someone who uses a phone
notebook and desktop as part of his
daily life and recently got a shield and
see what happens
all I told him is this use it as much as
you use it and record your thoughts if
it sucks and you think it's pointless
say that
you move a significant chunk of your
computing time over to the device then
say that so let's get his thoughts but
first a guide on how to shave your face
monstered my Dollar Shave Club
what are you doing um that how to shave
it's well it's kind of like I'd had a
basic party no no that's not this is
that that's this disgusting and you have
blood on your hands that actually blood
either way you're gonna have blood of
others on your hands if you release this
it's actually not okay okay either way
do your do your proper like
advertisement presentment thing present
the thing won't even talk right now
slippery this is disgusting I'll be back
I'll do my part
do your part properly we'll be okay so
uh yeah Dollar Shave Club saves you time
and saves you money for less than the
price of conventional shaving gear you
can join the club and have high-quality
razors sent directly to your door once
every month so you don't have to choose
between the two terrible options of
either using a dull razor or being stuck
trekking out to the store to fight with
a customer service representative to go
get the key from the thing to unlock it
so that you can overpay for blades and
have useless features that you don't
need like vibrating handles nope
instead of gimmick gimmicks like
promising to have bears shipping your
package from a party warehouse Dollar
Shave Club focuses on delivering
high-quality bathroom supplies that like
their shave butter that was featured so
prominently in this video and goes on
clear so you can see what you're doing
while you shave and their butt wipes for
men that with the help of a mirror also
go on clear and let you see what you're
doing
I mean well Dollar Shave Club doesn't
include
mirror for the but wait I came up with
that idea myself anyway the point is
dollarshaveclub.com / - to join the club
and now I'm going to hand off to Luke
for his impressions on life with the
Tegra note 7 from Nvidia as Linus said I
have not used a tablet before when I
first got my hands on this tablet my
first reaction was this is too small and
binky why would I care over a phone
spoiler alert that wasn't necessarily
the case but look into that later the
first thing that I liked on this tablet
not the main thing but the first thing
was emails being able to read a large
portion of the email and reply to at the
same time is really nice on my phone I
can see some of the email but not
usually a very usable amount and I find
myself hiding the keyboard a lot so I
can actually read the person's email to
make sure that I'm replying very
specifically to what they were saying so
it is nice sending emails on a tablet
but is buying a tablet just for emails
worth it probably not so now into gaming
which I found was awesome on this tablet
almost every single game that I could
play on Android on this tablet was way
better on this tablet than on my phone I
played on this tablet for quite a while
and then moved back to my phone and was
very annoyed at the lack of screen real
estate because when you get used to
having all of that room for touchscreen
movements and everything else that you
might run into when playing games like
Raiden being able to see that much more
and being able to move around that much
more on the screen is really nice
compared to a phone where it's actually
kind of small I even noticed a huge
improvement in this going from an s3 to
a note and going from a note to a tablet
is still a very noticeable improvement
and much much better
that being said heavily based joystick
games I have never liked on Android and
being able to play those on the tablet
didn't really make it that much better
because it's still a touchscreen game
using joysticks which I find a terrible
experience maybe you like it I don't
know that's totally up to you but
personally I do not like touchscreen
joysticks so that brought the shield up
to a point why don't why not the shield
why not use the shield the shield is a
good device it's great device for using
different things and playing different
games like I can't remember what it was
called the Raven shield or something
like that is way better on the shield
than it is on a tablet way better so if
you want to play those kind of games if
you want to be able to put it into
console mode and pull you into your TV
you want to be able to do any of that
kind of stuff awesome great if you want
to be
able to push games from your computer to
the shield and play them embed or
whatever awesome experience that's great
the problem I have with a shield is it's
not as well rounded as the tablet you're
not gonna want to send emails on it
feels like you're punching your name
into a game they haven't played before
for the same file and it's super
frustrating because your names really
long and you have to find the words all
the time using the d-pad or you have to
hold the screen in a really weird way to
be able to touch things on the screen
and neither of that great experiences so
personally I would probably go with the
tablet because it's more well rounded in
my opinion although if you happen to be
able to get both maybe you get a shield
on a discount because you bought a
graphics card with it or something like
that awesome
all encompassing experience that you
will really enjoy alright guys if you
made it pass Linus's Dollar Shave Club
integration and God here thank you for
watching thank you for sticking with us
I know that may have been a little bit
hard to watch it was a parody off of
howtobasic if you guys have seen him on
youtube or if you haven't I'm not
necessarily sure I'd recommend going and
watching it's a lot of basically what
line is just did so if you're into that
feel free if you're not maybe avoid it
like I do either way if you liked this
video like it dislike if you disliked it

you want to get a better discussion
medium go on the forum because it's just
