who reached out to us to showcase Bixby
voice but is it really a smarter way to
use your phone well we're gonna show you
guys five things Bixby can do that you
might not have expected starting with
this one
hi Bixby roll the intro
okay so get this have you ever been like
buried up to your chin in quicksand with
an army of like fire ants marching
towards your face and thought if only I
could unlock my nearby phone in a
hands-free manner and call for help yeah
me neither but I can still think of
plenty of situations where that could
come in handy
hi Bixby unlock the phone Linus rules
asterisks now let's look at another way
to execute simple voice queries this
time instead of summoning Bixby using
the wake-up phrase I'm just gonna hold
down the no dates dedicated bixby button
remind me to pick up milk when I leave
work so I've saved the location of our
office so Bixby knows to trigger the
reminder when I pull out of the parking
lot now check this one out when's my
anniversary now obviously that is a
personalized answer unique to me but
that's information that's not listed
publicly anywhere so where did it come
from
well Bixby can actually be configured to
respond in a specific way to trigger
phrases James apparently programmed a
few in for me before the shoot so uh why
don't we have a look here Who am I are
you a fan thanks James
okay so yeah I got it Bixby is great for
playing with your kids or trolling your
friends but getting back to productivity
samsung doesn't exactly think of Bixby
as a virtual agent but more of a voice
interface and I think that's because you
can actually do much more advanced
things like this go to the home screen
boom swipe right that one could come in
handy clear all my notifications turned
on the flashlight
all right it's like talking a glitch
from reboot take a selfie how do I look
so those are pretty powerful moves but
it gets even better you can perform
similar actions inside of apps and even
chain commands together like a macro so
for example let's say I liked my phone's
display to turn off after just a few
seconds to save on battery life well
that can be a real pain when I'm reading
an article with the phone sitting on the
table next to me by eating my breakfast
or whatever open display settings and
change the screen timeout to 10 minutes
neato
except that depending on how much of a
power user I am that might have taken
longer than just performing this action
with my fingers so what's the point well
this is where a little bit of
customization of bixby takes it to
another level
using verbal shortcuts called quick
commands hi Bixby reading mode okay I
set it to 10 minutes right so faster
voice commands are intended to help you
use your phone differently like for
fitness tracking inputting meals
throughout the day pretty easy
add a cup of coffee to my caffeine
tracker or my wife's personal favorite
measure my stress level I need it stay
still and be quiet that's hard for me
they're my stress levels green so thank
you everybody for your concern but as
I've said many times before I'm fine
everything is fine it's all fine now
Bixby is fully integrated with all the
native Samsung Apps take a screenshot
and email it to Luke but third-party
apps are joining the roster all the time
post my third last photo to Instagram
with the caption hashtag party time cool
huh so obviously big speaking here but
she can actually see to open Bixby
vision okay here you go so let's try our
neighborhood friendly stormtrooper here
okay so you can use it to shop for
related items on Amazon or look at
similar items on Pinterest some of these
are very stormtrooper like how theirs
are slightly less stormtrooper like so
that's a glimpse at Bixby for now it's
an intelligent interface between you and
your phone but it's learning all the
time so the more you use it the smarter
it'll get you can get more info on Bixby
and the devices that support her using
