product in one of our handy tech under a
hundred videos and they saw that video
and they reached out telling us that
they had something new coming and
decided to sponsor a video showing off
so what's new I think is this piece and
the idea behind it is transform your
cable into a magnetic Universal cable oh
I get it
I need a different cable Wow look at
those magnets that is so strong okay
I'll be right back
so this is the actual product and they
only sent these voltage cables because
they needed me to be able to compare
them I guess so here's what you do you
take any old regular cable and you plug
in this guy right here and it doesn't
affect your ability to use quick charge
or anything like that and then you get
look these tips so I've taken okay stop
it
okay so I've taken a regular microUSB
cable
I add the volta magnetic tip and then
lightning type-c or micro B I can turn
it into like a voltage cable so here
here's a Type C phone so you just keep
that in the bottom of your phone kind of
like a little magnetic you know you know
bottom plug and then you take your cable
you put it near it and boom you're
plugged in and charging so here let's go
ahead and pop one into here as well so
now if you or your significant other or
whoever else has a phone that has a
different connector you only need one
cable to just pop into any one of them
you want now obviously you could achieve
the same thing by just getting the
regular voltage cable and we'll have
those linked in the video description as
well but that is the key difference here
so you don't need the special cable
either I guess then neat
so the last thing that's kind of cool is
whether you're using the new cable
adapter version or whether you're using
the old version they've got little
indicator LEDs on the bottom of them
that show you that they're working so
they've got a bunch of different packs
starting at 14 bucks which gets you one
of these adapters and then two tips of
your choice so you can have two
different devices that you can pop it on
- interchangeably and goes all the way
up to like jumbo packs with ten of these
adapters and 20 tips depending on how
many people there are in your
potentially very large family that's
more of like a business thing so you can
check those out at the link in the video
