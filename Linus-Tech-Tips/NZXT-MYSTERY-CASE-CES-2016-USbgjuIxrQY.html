Vegas why why does that make any sense
stay tuned to find out thank you to
Squarespace for sending us to CES 2016
this year check out their website
squarespace.com slash lioness and use
offer code lines to save 10% so NZXT
brought us here to check out this case
it doesn't have a name it doesn't have a
price point but the part of it was
designed after a car a nice car that's
why I on the top of the case you'll see
a little bit of a divot personally
that's all I can find in terms of why it
looks like a car but there's some other
cool things about it as well all of the
panels are curved steel they're saying
that this is the first time this has
happened with a computer case I don't
know of any other ones that have curved
steel I know some ones that have curved
plastic so they may be right that kind
of a window not really a window because
it's solid black will eventually be
either a clear window a tinted window or
no window at all depending on what model
you get be crazy NZXT deck laying all
over it that makes it look like a new
car announcement will be removed on the
model that you buy and it will be a
various solid color and they're also
going to be launching in a potential
matte white look which could be pretty
cool the front and right hand side of
the case are fairly self-explanatory the
bottom has two bowed legs with some
rubber feet on it to elevate so it not
slide around your table the back of the
case is fairly self-explanatory again
but we learned some information here
again NZXT told us basically nothing but
you can see it's probably an MIT X board
with the standard ATX power supply
peering in through the back I learned a
few things that I can make as
assumptions but one disclaimer after put
here is one of the reasons why they
didn't show us the inside of the case is
all of this is subject to change it did
look like there was a basement it did
look like there was two 140 millimeter
fans in the front and maybe mounting
holes for 140 or 120 in the top I
definitely saw mounting holes for 140
and 120 but no fans up there and in the
back there was mounting holes and a fan
which was 120 millimeters also on the
back I see a little switch that leads
right to a circuit board which I'm going
to assume is 4
or maybe a mini hue controller so you
can control lighting inside the case
although I'm not entirely sure that
could also be for a fan controller but I
don't it's just click in or click out
I'm not sure we'll have to see once they
actually announce it on January 26 just
as a note for you guys also I think that
I saw some header cables for fans just
laying inside the case meaning that they
probably have some version of a grid I
wouldn't be that surprised if they
included other things that they've made
with in this case jumping back to the
outside there's a removable fan filter
for the power supply just in case you
want it to be in taking from the bottom
up on top of the case there's two USB
3.0 ports a power button on the left
hand side and two audio jacks 3.5
millimeter ones for headphone and
microphone just ahead of those headphone
and microphone jacks there is also a
little bit of a covered part which is
probably going to be impossible to
really pick up in the fancy b-roll here
but there is probably going to be a
little activity light there whatever
they decide to call this thing it's
fairly interesting it's not the standard
take that we've been seeing lately for
an ITX case traditionally with ITX cases
we've been getting smaller and smaller
this one actually takes it up a notch is
that a good thing I don't know I see a
lot of people these days going for ITX
because they don't need any more than
that and it's totally fine for
everything that they need because
there's no overclocking differences
there anything else this seems to be an
interesting take on an ITX case I'm
definitely gonna have to see it more
properly hands on in the office when I
can actually look at the inside of it
but just by looking at its eyes it could
maybe be a little bit smaller especially
because it doesn't have any o DD slots
but that could be a stylistic thing for
you people lately are going for ITX
systems not necessarily just because
they're small but because they don't
need any more than one expansion slot so
I'll have to see what people do with it
it's an interesting case nonetheless
entities take on an ITX case is actually
kind of interesting lately what we've
been seeing in this department is just
smaller and smaller and smaller and cram
everything in as small as the space you
can and hopefully it can cool itself but
the cooling on this guy is supposed to
be comparable to some of their other
much larger cases and if you're someone
who's going for an ITX system just
because you don't need more than one
expansion card you might still want a
big night
window in a fancy-looking case and hey
maybe that's applicable we'll have to
see on the 26 thank you to Squarespace
for sponsoring us here at CES 2016 this
year just a little tidbit our company
website is hosted on Squarespace so we
also wouldn't have that website if it
wasn't for Squarespace I don't know
whatever you could host your company
website on Squarespace pretty easily
it's not a hard system to use and if you
need help they have 24/7 live chat and
email support they have a whole bunch of
different templates they also have
commerce modules so if you want to host
a website where you'd put car like
decals on computers you could do that
through Squarespace that would be fine
you could sell your services it's it's
no big deal
