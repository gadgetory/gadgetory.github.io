would last for a week on a single charge
well do we ever have the solution for
you
introducing the Linus tech tips battery
expander just slap it on strap it on
plug it in and enjoy yeah that's pretty
ridiculous isn't it and yet here we are
eleven years after the introduction of
the original iPhone and pretty much this
legitimately is basically the solution
being pitched both by Apple and by third
parties to address their shoddy a
whole-day
asterisk as long as you don't use it too
much battery life has anyone considered
that there might be a better way you
know maybe we could I don't know just
put a bigger battery in the phone in the
first place well that is exactly what
you the phone did the power 5 is an
Android smartphone with five times the
battery capacity of the latest iPhone
10s and they claim this thing can last
for a week between charges look at it I
might just believe them and you know
what else I'd believe that I'm about to
tell you about the Trident II royal
series ddr4 from g.skill it features a
polished aluminium heat spreader that's
available in both gold or silver and a
crystalline light bar that radiates
beautiful RGB check it out at the link
below
13,000 milliamp hours
that's the advertised capacity of the
power five and in a phone that is
utterly massive like to put that in
perspective the latest iPhone 10s s
battery is 2600 milliamp hours the pixel
3 Excel weighs in slightly thicker at
3400 milliamp hours and even the note 9
which Samsung advertises as all day has
a mere four thousand milliamp hour
battery in it that puts the power five
at five times three point eight and
three point two five times larger
capacity than these phones respectively
that's a lot of juice it really is
basically like carrying around a regular
phone and a pretty beefy battery pack
which translates to some interesting
results but let's talk a bit about the
rest of the phone first it's pretty much
your standard a fair budget offshore
Android device with a six inch 1080p
screen that manages to be unremarkable
both in terms of image quality and feel
a relatively slow eight core CPU
somewhere around the level of a one plus
three and northamericans cellular band
support that's a little bit limited as
for aesthetics
some people are probably actually gonna
quite like this but I think it suffers
from kind of a dated appearance Jake got
LG g4 vibes from the back and as for me
I'm reminded of those leather cases that
people used to get for their really old
brick phones you know like the really
old ones the ones with the little like
flip out mouthpiece and the antenna that
comes up bright and you do you see that
at all yeah right yuck other than that
it doesn't really seem like anything
special that is until you pick the thing
up the sheer girth and more notably the
weight of it is like nothing that I've
experienced in a modern phone again
we need context for this the power 5 is
exactly twice as thick as the pixel 3 XL
and the phone weighs almost
three-quarters of a pound that is 330
grams for the metric folks out there
like it's kind of funny because on the
one hand
it will be actually impossible for many
people to operate one-handed and it's
not even top-heavy it just kind of feels
like it because there is so much weight
hanging off the top of your hand on the
other hand though it actually gives it
sort of a like premium feel that you
wouldn't expect from a 250 dollar
smartphone baton if you got in a fight
rig you can someone with this in your
head no I'm serious
the speakers or I should say speaker
there's just one or what I would
describe as useable unless you listen to
something decent first and realize how
much you're missing the dual front and
rear cameras are actually not the worst
thing ever but they use a Sony sensor
from 2015 so that should give you some
idea of the era of smartphone camera
quality to expect it's a far cry from
the pixel 3 but honestly it would
probably be fine for most people that is
unlike the fingerprint sensor which only
seems to work a fraction of the time no
matter how many times we tried to set it
up and even with all 5 fingerprint slots
and software used by the same finger
with that said at least when it does
work you are in for a treat just kidding
it's really slow but to be honest I
think a lot of people could probably
make those compromises for the added
stamina that this phone affords if
that's important to them like let's say
you're the kind of person who regularly
flies between Washington DC and Moscow
for work even if you were to watch
videos during that entire 12 or 13 hour
travel time the EULA phone wouldn't
break a sweat during our testing it
lasted for a staggering 31 and a half
hours of continuous watching YouTube
videos remember that's with Wi-Fi active
by comparison the pixel 3xl slum dit
with just under 14 hours and hey the
power 5 even supports GLONASS Russia's
version of GPS so you won't get lost
while you're over there ok but how about
something a little more and ikut of of
regular phone use let's say a combined
workload of web browsing photo and video
editing writing and data manipulation
well PC marks work 2.0 benchmark hits
the phone with this sort of mishmash of
common workflow
without any standby time in between and
again the EULA phone impresses with 3.6
times the effective battery life of
Google's latest and greatest so with
some quick napkin math here let's say
you know four hours of that kind of load
per day you would end up with more than
nine days of battery life like obviously
you'd still have some standby usage but
to say that a week of battery life on
this thing is possible would actually be
pretty safe all right now let's talk
about gaming imagine for a moment
playing a mobile game on your phone
literally all day going to sleep then
doing the same thing all the next day
without having to plug in that's
possible and then at the opposite end of
the scale what about going on a
week-long backcountry camping trip using
just your phone for navigation like the
possibility is that this thing unlocks
are freaking bananas so much so that I
actually kind of wondered if the thing
would even finish charging overnight but
it actually doesn't take that long so
the included wall board here is SPECT
for their own style of quick charging
with a slightly odd although one plus
has a similar scheme five volt
five amp output that juices the phone
from zero to a hundred percent in a
rated two and a half hours although your
mileage may vary slightly
so bottom line yeah we know battery life
isn't a problem for everyone you might
have a place to plug in at your desk or
in the car or on the plane and honestly
speaking for how much heavier this phone
is it might actually be more convenient
for folks who don't want to get their
phone arm all like jacked to just carry
a battery bank in their purse or
backpack or whatever but we'll let you
guys be the judge of that
in fact we'll let you guys be the judge
of what the best way forward is in
general leave a comment is the
convenience here worth the compromise
should we stick to the status quo or
should we maybe try and find a middle
ground like I personally have wanted for
a long
to see a 6,000 or 7,000 milliamp hour
phone with like an endurance Edition
from a Tier one manufacturer like
Samsung or Apple or Google am I ever
gonna get that probably not but what I
will get is this sponsor message for I
fix it I fix it's been helping people
fix PCs laptops phones and all kinds of
electronics for years and we've actually
been using their tools to do just those
things for well years as well and you
can get your fix on with I fix its new
line of Marlin screwdrivers each fixed
blade screwdriver features an ergonomic
knurled rubberized handle with a swivel
top plus a black oxide coated tip so it
hangs onto tiny screws with a steel grip
the set case lid is held in place
magnetically and can be used as a
sorting tray and is manufactured in
Germany and backed by I fix its lifetime
warranty so don't hesitate stop giving
away money having someone else repair
your electronics when you can just do it
yourself with a marlin screwdriver set
and the great guides over at ifixit.com
it's just $24.99 less than what you'd
often pay for just one repair done by a
third party go check it out so thanks
