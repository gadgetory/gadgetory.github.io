I've actually got their entire SSD
lineup in front of me it might not be
the whole thing actually they have so
many SSD products from about this line
over and kind of going over this way
we've got the current product so you've
got your vertex your agility as well as
your solid - these are all products that
we've seen a lot of but there is some
new stuff here too
first of all you've got the vertex -
which you can see they've improved both
the sustain breeds the random reads the
sustained writes and the random writes
and it also features a brand new
controller as featured on an antique
home so you should definitely check out
the review of this they're expecting it
to come out sometime around the February
maybe March timeframe if it does get
pushed back another really cool thing
we've got is the vertex - frogurt X -
Pro X which are basically a faster
controller or a faster controller with
SLC flash so this is gonna be more
interesting to the enterprise guys but
that doesn't make it an irrelevant
product so it's very cool to be able to
see this now this is by far the coolest
one maybe you won't be able to afford
one effect if you're a consumer I can
pretty much guarantee you will be able
to afford one but you remember the C
Drive C Drive is incredibly high spec
and manages amazing sustained reads and
writes because it uses a piece
Express interface rather than a
traditional SATA 2 or even SATA 3
interface for a hard drive now the C
Drive has been updated to the p88 model
which you can see it's using a PCI
Express 4x interface but the cool thing
about this and I'm gonna get the camera
person who is assisting me here got a
funny look on his face now to have a
look really closely here you can see
that it actually features upgradeable
flash so you can buy a particular model
of the pata and then you can actually
upgrade it to a higher density flash
later on down the line so it actually
features here I'm gonna turn it around
to the back so you can see here we've
got four in the links controllers on the
back of this card it is a stacked card
so there are four more into links
controllers and then we've got an
internal RAID controller on the card
right here it looks to be a single slot
solution but it might bump into the back
of some parts depending how far
components stick up on the back if they
have a backplate or whatever but to me
this is by far the coolest product I've
seen so far in CES and I think the guys
that it was easy for showing it to me
via be sure to check out my video blog
every day for more unboxings and product
