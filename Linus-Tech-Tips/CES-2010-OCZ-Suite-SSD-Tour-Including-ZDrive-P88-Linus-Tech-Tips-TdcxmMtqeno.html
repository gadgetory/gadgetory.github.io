I've actually got their entire SSD line
up in front of me it might not be the
whole thing actually they have so many
SSD products from about this line over
and kind of going over this way we've
got the current product so you've got
your vertex your agility as well as your
solo too these are all products that
we've seen a lot of but there is some
new stuff here too first of all you've
got the vertex to which you can see
they've improved both the sustained
breeds the random reads the sustained
rights and the random right and it also
features a brand new controller as
featured on an antique home so you
should definitely check out the review
of this they're expecting it to come out
sometime around the februari maybe march
timeframe if it does get pushed back
another really cool thing we've got is
the vertex 2 from vertex two Pro X which
are basically a faster controller or a
faster controller with slc flash so this
is going to be more interesting to the
enterprise guys but that doesn't make it
in a relevant product so it's very cool
to be able to see this now this is by
far the coolest one maybe you will be
able to afford one effect if you're a
consumer I can pretty much guarantee you
will be able to afford one but you
remember the z drive z drive is
incredibly high spec and manages amazing
sustained reads and writes because it
uses a piece
Express interface rather than a
traditional Santa two or even say 23
interface for a hard drive now the z
drive has been updated to the p88 model
which you can see it's using a PCI
Express 4x interface but the cool thing
about this and I'm going to get the
camera person who is assisting me here
we've got a funny look on his face now
to have a look really closely here you
can see that it actually features up a
gradable flash so you can buy a
particular model of the pata and then
you can actually upgrade it to a higher
density flash later on down the line so
it actually features here I'm going to
turn it around to the back so you can
see here we've got pour into links
controllers on the back of this card it
is a stacked card so there are four more
into links controllers and then we've
got an internal raid controller on the
card right here it looks to be a single
slot solution but it might bump into the
back of some parts depending how far
components stick up on the back if they
have a back plate or whatever but to me
this is by far the coolest product I've
seen so far as CES and I thank the guys
that it was easy for showing it to me
via be sure to check out my video blog
every day for more unboxings and product
