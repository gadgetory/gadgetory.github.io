stuff I gotta make sure that it doesn't
really know what's coming because some
of my stuff is going to be kind of fun
kind of fun surprise type things I don't
know how well I'm gonna be able to
conceal this one
it sounds like stormtrooper oh oh it's
not stormtrooper armor but that's a very
good idea how inconspicuous do I look
okay I'm ready okay
whoa dang one two man this is gonna suck
Dragon Age Inquisition had a pre minor
bug here there but there's nothing too
difficult to get out of and nothing that
was necessarily game-breaking either at
least nothing that I came across that
was game breaking what was interesting
about the game was that this included
mantle and the difficulties that come
with that if you want to see more silly
challenges like this like - doing review
in full body face stay subscribe save on
select Intel CPUs knucks and SSDs with
special Black Friday rebates from select
retailers click now to learn more and
thus began our adventure of benchmarking
with mantle the first hurdle was found
after I had finished all of my Nvidia
testing using fraps mantle doesn't
exactly play nicely with fraps and
because of this I had to toss all of my
data and find a different solution just
the tip
enter FCAT when we're trying to record
4k we found out that our capture card
doesn't support RGB input unfortunately
but at the same time MD cards didn't
support ycbcr output the case with
Nvidia was we didn't actually test it so
we didn't know if they supported that
but it didn't really matter because they
would both have to work regardless and
after all of this the final proverbial
nail in the coffin was that the FCAT / k
overlay required for recording these
frame times doesn't natively work in
mental either just like the fraps
overlay doesn't as well dice actually
hacked support for FCAT into battlefield
for a solution that Bioware as of this
point has not included in Dragon Age
Inquisition we're done which brought us
to our final solution regrettably we had
to use the built-in benchmarking utility
which unsurprisingly
doesn't seem all that precise and it
runs through the same cam sections of
the game at a super speed and then spits
out a minimum average framerate in about
40 seconds or less the results of these
tests could bear oh my goodness it could
vary anywhere from 0.5 to 2 FPS
throughout the benchmarks whereas
usually with our own benchmarks anything
from above 0.1 to 0.2
I guys smoked you oh it's bleeding it
was fine though guys no it's fine
keeping those issues in mind our 1080p
results were quite linear something to
note here is that while the 290x is
behind the 780ti and averages it
actually beat it in minimums by 0.1 but
still it's important to note because
glosses in minimum FPS is much more
noticeable than anything else the story
with 4k was more or less the same but
please note that I had settings quite
hard to demonstrate the ability for
Dragon Age Inquisition to push your
system if running this is a
a bit difficult for you on your own
definitely just turn down the
performance of our turned down the
settings a little bit and your
performance will be a lot better
just like with 1080p testing the results
were quite linear and the minimums for
AMD we're actually noteworthy with 290x
beating the 780ti by 0.6 and averages
but by a whopping 2.2 in minimums
speaking of things that perform really
well I had to catch those and I'm happy
I did because we actually needed to
segue into our sponsor spot our friends
