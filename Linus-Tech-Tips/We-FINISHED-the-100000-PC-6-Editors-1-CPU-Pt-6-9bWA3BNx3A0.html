finishing the 100,000 ish dollar six
editors one CPU machine it's been a
freaking long time coming so we won't
make you guys wait that's all looking
peachy
any longer now this should work and it
should show up over here to hear this
word from our sponsor pebble host are
you in the market for a hosting provider
try pebble host they balance price and
performance with VPS hosting starting at
275 to gig and game hosting at $1 a gig
use code LTT at the link below to save
15%
at this point those of you who have been
keeping up with the $100,000 PC saga
have probably seen this machine put
together and then torn apart again four
or five times so it's safe to say that
we've already dry fitted everything and
we know it all pretty much works
together so just like the last video in
this series we've stuck with the god
tier ty n s 70 100 px motherboard yes
it's a little ugly because aesthetics
and RGB aren't exactly top priorities
for server manufacturers yet
give it time but it's got it where it
counts because the thing just works
speaking of working the original CPUs
that Intel supplied for this build are
of course no longer working I dropped
one of them and we weren't able to
source a matching retail Xeon 8180
platinum replacement without spending
nearly ten thousand US dollars remember
guys you need to use two of the exact
same model in most dual socket systems
so we turned to eBay and obtained a pair
of Q s or qualification sample 81 ATS
for less than half of what we'd have
spent for a single retail one now Q s
chips aren't perfect but unlike
engineering samples which may be less
reliable or have significantly lower
clock speeds q s chips are the ones that
are sent out to OEMs just before a
particular model launches for their
final validation and testing what that
means is that in many instances they are
practically speaking or even literally
exactly the same as a retail chip save
for the labeling on the integrated heat
spreader so we are hoping that these
should work perfectly for our little
experiment especially with an ek
Annihilator CPU block keeping each one
of them cool man those are industrial
looking for our RAM we stuck with the
384 gigs of ECC ddr4 memory running an
ace
six channel configuration that our
friends from Kingston sent over almost a
year ago so this is going to give us
about 60 gigs of memory for each of our
six virtualized 8k video editing
workstations with a little bit of
leftover RAM for our hypervisor
now our GPUs are of course the same six
nvidia titan v12 gig HBM two cards that
we've been working with since earlier in
the project each one of our virtual
editing stations is going to get one of
these fully dedicated to it now because
we're using GPU pass-through as far as
our editor is concerned it's like that
card is installed directly into their
own computer now for this video we've
done something special with our cards
each one of them was outfitted with one
of these beautiful acetal slash nickel
EK water blocks and then made it to a
custom six GPU terminal which might give
you guys some of those sweet nostalgia
feels from all the way back in seven
gamers one cpu massive thanks to EK by
the way for going out of their way to
make this thing happen because dang this
looks awesome now to dissipate the up to
2,000 watts of heat that our CPUs and
GPUs will kick out under full load and
remember that without overclocking we
settled on a full complement of EK water
blocks is ultra thick class radiators
we've got quad 140 millimeter units for
both the top and the bottom as well as a
triple fan model on the front now we did
have a bit of trouble mounting our 140
millimeter knocked to a fence as the
clearances are just slightly off with
these radiators but thanks to some space
under the top panel we made it work now
even with this configuration we're not a
hundred percent sure that we've got
enough cooling capacity problem is we
kind of had to roll with it since case
labs the company that makes this monster
chassis excuse me I misspoke I should
have said made this monster chassis
because they went out of business
while we were working on this project so
we really can't get any more parts for
it not that I think there would have
been anywhere to mount them because I
think we've managed to build one of the
few machines in existence that truly
needs a case of this magnitude to find
out why let's have a look at the crown
jewel of our build this PCI Express
expansion daughterboard courtesy of one
stop systems so this bad boy or girl
whatever it is is gonna allow us to take
the bottom PCIe 16x lot on our
motherboard and then break it out into
eight more slots for a total capacity of
up to fourteen expansion cards take that
Mac Pro what this gives us is to
individually hot pluggable USB ports for
each of our editing machines and a
Mellanox 100 Gigabit Ethernet card to
pull all that juicy 8k footage off of
our main editing server which is also
equipped with one of Mellanox is
high-speed network cards now we're only
able to run our cards at 40 gigabit
because we don't have a 100 gigabit
network switch or enough PCI Express
bandwidth anyway but that should still
be plenty for six 8k raw streams so the
thing is here that the daughter board
wasn't necessary per se it's just that
without it we would have had to use a
bunch of USB hubs and assign each USB
device individually to our editors
meaning that any changes would require
reconfiguration and unread and a reboot
of the virtual machine so yeah it's
mostly a creature comfort but I think
it's super cool because it means that
for all intents and purposes our editors
might as well be sitting at a completely
normal computer now mounting this thing
was a bit hard to watch not because Jake
doesn't know his way around a dremel or
anything but it's more just that this is
a five hundred US dollar case and more
importantly you straight-up can't
by them anymore thankfully it turned out
prayed and clean we actually ended up
stealing the PCI Express slots from a
thermaltake tower 900 and it worked
perfectly for the eight cards that we
needed to install then we mounted the
daughter board with some upside down
bolts threaded through the bottom of the
case and it was off to the races now as
for the rest of the trunk over here we
ended up going with dual EVGA 1600 watt
t2 80 + titanium power supplies with
some sexy cable mod cables now I'm one
of the first people to point out that
one power supply of this magnitude is
totally unnecessary but this is not
exactly a normal computer remember guys
even just the GPUs in this system could
be too much for a single power supply
1600 watts or otherwise so for us then
two of these bad boys fits the bill
nicely and should even give us plenty of
headroom for capacitor aging or even
overclocking think of it kind of like
being that guy at the car show with the
nitrous bottle in their trunk except the
nitrous is a second power supply and
rather than being outside they're in
their mom's basement
speaking of horsepower adders the 810
terabyte nas drives that we have
installed in the front of the case can
be used to assign local bulk storage to
our virtual machines and we'll be using
our dual Intel 905 P series
octane SSDs as a right cash for our
magnetic drives as well as for raw high
speed storage from the windows installs
for each of our editor now the reason we
used octane for this is that when you're
hitting a drive with six users at a time
booting up or launching programs even a
high speed nvme SSD can struggle well
obtained has much faster access times so
we're hoping that to our editors this
entire virtualization experience should
be transparent although we haven't
actually tested that yet now with the
build mostly dry assembled at this point
we could finally get to running our
tubes yes we went with soft tubing so no
it's not the sexiest machine in the
world but with a good chunk of Ek water
blocks nickel fittings and a little bit
of creativity we still think it looks
pretty good
not in a blinged-out RGB gaming rig kind
of way but more of like a this thing
does real work kind of way and it has
the added benefit of making it much
easier to reconfigure the system if we
ever decide to upgrade it in the future
so from there just add water and a
little bit of patience and well BAM
finished system of course we're not done
yet though I've been out of the office
for a few days while Jake's been getting
things together so why don't we go check
it out alright so for our first power-on
test we're not trying to go full ham
virtual machines everything so we've
actually unplugged our opt-in drives and
our hard drives and just through a
simple basic SATA SSD with the windows
install on it because we want to make
sure it's all still working after the
assembly ordeal we have fans spin hey do
we have display on the other side nice
we want to find out if our cooling
solution is actually adequate before we
start though let's do a good
old-fashioned Cinebench r15 run ready
there it is boys oh my god and you're
done 7000 so something that a lot of
people don't know is that just because
you have two CPU sockets doesn't mean
that even a heavily multi-threaded
application like blender you can see
it's using the entire first CPU it
doesn't necessarily mean that it can
utilize the second CPU it just doesn't
quite work that way
all right so here we are blenders
running our GPUs are all sitting at 75
80 percent utilization our CPUs at 92
percent and all we can do is let it cook
for a bit oh wow
like just this chassis being made out of
aluminum just like feels like a
idea like there's so much flex to it if
only it was like a cheese grater I don't
think he could fit that many cores in
the cheese grater yeah this is twice as
many cores as a new Mac Pro just say the
highest-end macro yeah that means each
one of our editing stations effectively
has an 8 core CPU 60 gigs of memory a
100 gig octane drive and its own Titan V
and wow they actually booted really fast
in spite of you like starting them
rapid-fire like that that's flippin
awesome and we're good you know what no
for the purposes of today we're just
trying to find out if it can handle a
full load yeah thermally and stability
wise so let's forget about premiere
let's just start loading up stress tests
on these things what stress test should
we do well let's throw like Ida and fur
mark boom there alright so here comes
our first set of stress tests we're
going stress FPU on i-264 and GPU stress
tests at 1600 by 1200 yeah that's better
if we don't leave a couple of cpu cores
for fur mark to grab then it throttles
the GPU and we don't use up all the
power so I'm do you number four I'm
having fun
it's finally done all right I'm ready to
go with stress test number four not bad
is there a reason you didn't put fans in
the bottom of two here no no good we
should yeah cuz that would look more
symmetrical ish we've got to cool these
obtain SSD zo actually it's not a
terrible idea
fans still not on on the second power
supply ok so we've had the whole thing
running for about five minutes now our
block of GPU blocks is noticeably warm
to the touch not hot not uncomfortable
but it's warm these fans that are
blowing down at like it's kind of like
having a space heater blowing at me from
under the computer
same thing up here and we've actually
got some temperature results as well so
it looks like our GPUs have settled in
right around the 55 to 60 degree mark
depending on which ones we're looking at
and then Jake you've got CPU temps right
48 49 across the board
now we're not fully loading the CPU but
I mean we're probably over 80% right you
tell me that looks not bad
we're hitting it pretty hard so that's
it guys at long last it's finally
working not only that but our cooling
solution is adequate good job Jake and
the thing actually seems to be stable so
all that's left now then is to get a
nice long 40 gigabit network cable plug
this thing into our switch and get six
editors set up with full stations around
it and to see if we actually can do it
because this is all been theoretical up
until now theoretically if we have eight
CPU cores and a Titan V and 60 gigs of
RAM should be fine but it's all
theoretical up till now let's see if we
can do it six x 8k editing workstations
off of a single power it's finally
working speaking of work I've got some
work to do too to tell you guys about
our sponsor for today's video mass drop
the mass drop HD 6 xx headphones is one
of the most successful collaborations
that drop comm has ever done they've
sold over 70,000 units of these things
making them the all-time bestseller on
mass drop and it's no wonder if they've
got a balanced mid-range natural
sounding bass they're open back they
sound absolutely fantastic they're
actually very similar to my daily driver
HD 650 s and they've made a couple of
tweaks based on community feedback
they've got a 1/8 inch plug for everyday
use and a 1/4 inch adapter for
professional use and Sennheiser backs
these headphones with their support so
check out the link below and get your HD
6 xx headphones today so thanks for
watching guys if
just like this video 8 it's on now you
can hit that button but if you liked it
hit light get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
the one I'm wearing and our community
forum which you should totally join I'm
a little bit concerned one of our
displays just went blank hey ok the
monitor just went to sleep it's all good
yeah yeah it's still working
so 100,000 dollar computer was based on
if we were gonna load it up completely
with top-end Quadro cards which didn't
end up happening so we took some
artistic liberties with the gaming of
the computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
