in the last like three and a half weeks
I've been all over the place New York
two or three times LA and now finally I
am in beautiful Paris
so it's night time I was thinking to
myself I could go out and I could see
the sights enjoy the nightlife or I
could show you guys something that I
whipped up that I call the ultimate
travel gaming setup okay so I know what
you guys are thinking that's just a
razor blade stealth with a mousepad a
mouse and international adapter and
power brick there's nothing ultimate
gaming and there's nothing special about
it but I do have a piece that is special
and this was actually kind of inspired
by my upcoming review of the razor blade
stealth because as you guys probably
know if you've seen any coverage of a
previous played stealth one of the big
selling points for razor for this device
is its compatibility with their razor
core external graphics card enclosure
but I don't think most people are gonna
buy that kind of thing so I wanted to
review the device stand alone but that
doesn't mean that I wanted to ignore the
capabilities however as you guys have
probably noticed this is not a razor
blade core this is the secret sauce that
actually makes this travel gaming setup
more possible because the core or core
v2 now I guess is really designed to be
left at home so you take your notebook
around with you you get home you plug in
your Thunderbolt cable and boom you've
got a full desktop grade graphics
experience this guy this is the a horas
GT X 1080 gaming box and it's actually
available with a variety of different
GPUs pre-installed in it
so small and compact that you could be
reasonably expected to travel around
with it
so it enables a completely different use
case than the razor core which is
actually pretty bulky not to mention it
does not come with a handy-dandy little
travel case so razor doesn't really
advertise this but their blade stealth
and actually their blade for that matter
I've tested them with a variety of
different external thunderbolt and
external GPU enclosures and I've
actually found that while they don't
guarantee interoperability between their
notebooks and their GPU enclosures and
third-party accessories it's actually
been pretty good so your mileage may
vary in terms of which external box you
use but I wouldn't necessarily feel like
you have to buy the razor one and that's
a good thing because razor I mean I love
you guys and all that but you guys
charge a freaking lot for your external
GPU box but pricing on this one puts it
closer to if you account for that it
comes with a gtx 1080 inside and that
those obviously have a cost this guy
comes to about two hundred dollars only
compared to the razor core v2 at about
five hundred dollars so it doesn't come
with this fancy orange cable mod cable
that was that was actually something
that i added so on the one side you've
got a really large fan that is
completely dedicated like all the way
from here to here to here to here to
this mini gt x 1080 graphics card on the
front you've just got a ARS logo on this
side you've got a built-in power supply
a couple of cooling fans that are
bringing fresh air in over here and then
around back you find the business end so
there's a standard PCIe 16x graphics
card so feasibly you could actually swap
this out in the future if you could find
something that would fit then you've got
some included i/o so you've got a fast
charging USB three three more USB 3s and
then the Thunderbolt that you need in
order to power the GPU so it doesn't
have the same IO as the core and honest
I'll tell you guys it's been a little
bit more finicky at this stage been the
razor core has requiring a reboot
sometimes in order to be detected but
overall the experience has been pretty
decent so we just take our Thunderbolt 3
cable plug that bad boy in and what's
cool about this is that we actually
don't even need the blade stealth
included power adapter anymore so this
takes the place of your laptop power
adapter ok so let's fire it up the
gaming box actually turns on
automatically once you plug in
Thunderbolt and power up your machine I
just need to give my setup a second to
detect my mouse and all that good stuff
getting a couple issues with USB
connectivity this is something that I've
seen with this particular box before it
doesn't affect my use case right now but
it is something to maybe keep an eye out
for before you go ahead and jump on this
exact setup but but overall this is
about the direction we're heading in
terms of mobile gaming like look how
compact and easy to travel with this
whole setup is ok now before I fire up
the game there's one quick thing I want
to check just I want to make sure that
this hand shook properly so yes
GT X 1080 shows up here and the Nvidia
control panel shows up so we should be
good to go now I just want to configure
my options here now normally playing on
a laptop even a gaming laptop you'd be
setting up like bitch tier options but
not today we're gonna crank it to 3200
by 1800 FXAA and we're turning the
graphics to very high with motion blur
off now to be clear the best gaming
experience on these external boxes is
had with an external monitor because
there's only so much bandwidth in this
Thunderbolt connection there's a PCIe 4x
connection and then some protocol
overhead so when you have to communicate
from the system to the graphics card in
order to actually render the game then
that's a lot of bandwidth and then when
you have to send the graphics cards
display output data in
of actually hooking up an HDMI or
DisplayPort connection here when you
have to send it and I think it's called
loopback mode back to the laptops
display then you end up hurting yourself
because you're using some of your
bandwidth up for that so you can expect
to take anywhere from a 10 to a 20
percent performance hit is this not
incredible like yeah we're only running
it 38 to 42 fps so it's not the
smoothest gaming experience of all time
but like I'm being pretty unfair to it
like we're running at 3800 by 1600 I
don't have to do that on a 13.3 inch
display so let's say we drop it to 1920
by 1080 let's have a look at what
performance looks like there there it is
my friends ultra details 65 to 70 FPS
gaming in a reasonably demanding game on
a laptop okay so I know that external
GPU boxes aren't new and the razor blade
stealth isn't particularly new obviously
carrying a mouse around with you when
you travel isn't new but the reason that
I'm bringing this up now as opposed to
before is just because a few things have
all come together and made this sort of
this what's been a pipe dream of mine
for the future start to look like it's a
lot closer maybe even a reality today so
number one is that these external GPU
boxes are getting both smaller and
cheaper that's awesome
number two is that notebooks these
actually legitimately thin and light
notebooks with great battery life I use
this on a plane for over six hours with
a couple of battery tweaks on my way
here finally have quad-core processors
because that was the issue a lot of
modern games are finally getting to the
point where they can actually use more
than just a couple of CPU cores so even
though razors been talking about this
use case for well since the blade
stealth launched it never made any sense
to me before but check this out so you
can see here the CPU is turbo hang up as
high as like three points
gigahertz and change to keep the CPU
from being a bottleneck and this is
pretty cool here back up a little bit
I'm gonna lean in with my microphone
which I'm wearing this whole setup is
quiet so in some ways this is actually
better for my purposes than a gaming
laptop with everything integrated
because now I can upgrade my super
portable notebook or my GPU separately
as my needs change and the pricing is
not that far off especially when you
consider that like this graphics card is
non-proprietary so it could just be
moved to like a friend's desktop or
resold when you need a new GPU like ah
this is totally game-changing so thanks
guys for checking out my video on the
ultimate travel gaming setup if you
dislike that you can hit that button if
you liked it hit like if you want to get
subscribe do that if you want to check
out where to buy the stuff we featured
I'll try and throw links in the video
description for that this is actually
available with a number of different
GPUs I'm not sure if I mentioned that
before also down there's our merch store
and our community forums so you should
totally join that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
