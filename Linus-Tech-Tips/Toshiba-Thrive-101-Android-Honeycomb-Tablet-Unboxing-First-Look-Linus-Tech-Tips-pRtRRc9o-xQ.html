consider to be of the Android Honeycomb
tablets with NVIDIA Tegra 2 technology
sort of a very PC approach to it so
instead of going with the elegance over
functionality approach of something like
an aluminium back which looks great but
it's kind of heavy it's not very durable
it scratches it looks grungy after a
while it looks great when it's new but
after that it doesn't the Thrive takes a
very practical approach to things that
I'll get more into as I proceed with the
unboxing so why don't you have a look at
the overall spec comes with 16 gigs of
storage and it is sure as heck not a
hard drive that is solid-state storage
you better believe that they didn't ship
until Android 3.1 was available so they
kind of took the we're not going to ship
it until it's perfect approach to the
Thrive and that's what they say so why
why disagree until I've actually tried
tried the device itself all right it has
a 10.1 inch multi-touch LED backlit
screen that's cool 2 megapixel webcam
and 5 megapixel camera alright gyroscope
sensor so do they all full-size USB 2.0
port there you go BAM so that is part of
what feels very PC about the Thrive to
me is that they've gone with like they
suck it honestly you can't put a
full-size USB port on this because it's
too thin so toshiba has compromised that
elegance in order to give you that
functionality so that's what I mean all
right full sized SD card slot
BAM once again full size SD card slot so
that means you can take the 16 gig you
can throw in a big old fat SD card so
unlike something like the transformer
where you have to plug it into the the
add-on keyboard and carry that around
with you in order to have a full sized
slot you can just throw a full-size SD
card in here and yeah I mean and you can
carry around the USB key which plenty of
people carry around USB keys you can
carry pretty much as much storage as you
want for the Thrive ok next HDMI port
BAM HDMI port so it has all the ports it
has all that functionality and we
haven't even gotten to what I would
consider the most user-friendly thing
about the Thrive easy-grip
back cover stereo speakers good to know
box contents they don't even say it
unreal it's not even on the box it has a
user replaceable battery I know right
what other tablet is going to give you
the option to actually keep using it a
couple of years down the road when your
bad really
battery life inevitably starts being
terrible you can actually replace it on
this guy go figure right okay so let's
keep going here QuickStart guide for the
Thrive we got the locations of a bunch
of stuff some system indicator lights
where all the ports are homescreen
information basic setup stuff cool how
to backup your data this is all good
stuff to know we have tablet accessories
so you can get a bunch of different
color back screams that's really nice
that's functional customizable you know
now you can tell you know little
Johnny's thrive from little Sally's
thrive if you have a couple of different
tablets in the house which more and more
people are starting to get into actually
it's got a few other first party
accessories here cases the portfolio 360
case and power options Toshiba
lithium-ion battery pack replacement or
additional battery for the Toshiba
tablets so cool right only 89 bucks so
you can actually carry an extra battery
with you if you're on a long flight
like imagine having that option for your
iPad let's say they don't have a charger
on there what are you gonna do I mean
you can carry around those little things
but those don't last that long those
little external chargers so you can
actually carry additional batteries the
first thing I do when I got a new camera
is I buy extra battery for it because I
know I'm gonna need it very convenient
information for your tablet device cool
one year standard limited warranty for
tablet device hey tech stuff comes with
$10 of music downloads from me music
beep oh my goodness look at all this
documentation okay enjoy for free ebooks
cool we've made the app world revolve
around you to give an app place is the
smart way to find the opportunity so
they've got their own little custom app
market and how to use it
cool move drive stickers and finally the
thing it all came in alright let's see
what else we got down here lots and lots
of stuff
dump out all the stuff okay
first we have an AC power cord then we
have an AC AC adapter so there's your
charger it's a little on the big side
okay and then finally we have a USB to
mini-usb cable
so that's SATA presumably for data
transfer so they'll thrive once again it
stays away from that that Apple esque
type approach which is create a custom
proprietary connector no the Thrive
instead uses a standard DC power adapter
which you could argue that this is less
elegant of course it is but it has that
functionality you can replace this very
very easily whereas if you're running
around the office room I go oh my why
iPhones out of battery does anyone have
iPhone cable and nobody has one you
you're screwed you have to go buy one
for like 20 bucks or whatever they cost
from the max okay and then for data
transfer standard USB cable which means
if you lose your Galaxy Tab 10.1 custom
dot connector and you need to transfer
some data you don't have to do it
wirelessly you can still sync things you
just grab another USB cable which
inevitably you have like you know 20 of
them at home if you're anything like me
and you've got about 20 of them at home
all right now let's have a look at all
of the stuff that is labeled on the
convenience screen protector that is
included
they even label where to seal it check
that up so stereo speakers you've got
one yeah let's get this off okay
give me a second this is gonna take me a
bit so I left on the front screen cover
because it's kind of convenient to have
all this stuff labeled for me so the
stereo speakers down here at the bottom
I'm just gonna show you where those are
that's a good location so the Galaxy Tab
10.1 has the speaker's here and here
which is also fine because when you're
watching movies you're gonna watch them
like this so if you have the speaker's
anywhere around here or at the back here
like the stupid iPad this has its peak
they're just like the stupidest place in
the world
it's not even stereo then you cover it
up and you can't even hear your movie so
that's that's like ridiculous right so
the stereo speakers on the bottom is a
pretty good place for them I'm I'm I'm
on board with that docking connector at
the bottom so apparently it does have a
dock connector you just don't have to
use it me okay and then you've got a
little plastic cover so you can just
cover that right up if you don't want to
use it great
you've also got the AC power part right
there along with your headphone and
microphone port so that's one of those
combo ones alright next you've got a
cover here which comes off like that
you've got a full-size USB hey full size
HDMI full size HDMI I know right and
then you've also got any mini USB all
right so let's cover that back up we go
up here full size SD card slot okay up
here screen rotation lock that's
actually really good button to have I do
use that button this is the only Android
3.1 tablet that I've seen I should say
3.1 I mean who knows what Android we'll
be using a year from now and someone
watches this video but the only
honeycomb tablet that I've seen that has
that screen rotation lock I do use it on
the iPad 2 so I find that a useful thing
to have volume adjust other than being
oh I guess it's not really backwards ok
so here here's a hint unlike most of the
Android tablets that I've looked at so
far this is sort of meant to be used in
portrait mode like the iPad 2 so you
look at the orientation of the button so
this is volume up this is volume down
whereas on some of the more landscape
oriented ones they would have a volume
up volume down orientation which would
be which would be different so here it's
backwards if you're using it in
landscape it's up down when you hold it
like that ok so just something to bear
in mind also on the on the I guess on
the right hand side of the tablet since
I should hold it the way it's meant to
be used we've got our power button and
then finally we have a back cover lock
oh this takes off the back cover I guess
somehow are they like two lakhs for it
or something because remember it is it
is replaceable so you can you can put on
a different color or whatever the case
may be if you want you know what I'll
figure something I'll figure that out
later
so again in line with the portrait
orientation being the intended usage
model the Toshiba logo on the back is in
portrait mode so you're holding it like
this it's right-side up also the camera
is the 5 megapixel camera is here and
then the 2 megapixel camera is here
along with the microphone input so let's
go ahead and pull this off you know what
let's do a bit of a form factor
comparison give me a sec guys so for
comparisons sakes I have the zoom
transformer TF 101 iPad 2 and the Galaxy
Tab 10.1 here so I want you to actually
get get down to their level here and you
can clearly see that the Thrive is the
thickest tablet on the table so it is
thicker than even the transformer in the
zoom and significantly thicker actually
I should take the iPad 2 and the Galaxy
Tab 10.1 and put those out in the front
significantly thicker than those so that
is a bit of a disadvantage in terms of
the form factor so it is thick it isn't
unreasonably heavy though like it
doesn't feel more heavy to wield than
something like the zoom although it
definitely doesn't even begin to
approach something like the Galaxy Tab
10.1 in terms of the lightness so it
comes down to what has really been the
focus of this unboxing for me which is
the function out the form versus
functionality argument do you want that
full-size USB the full size HDMI and
that full-size SD card built right into
the tablet or do you want that style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
