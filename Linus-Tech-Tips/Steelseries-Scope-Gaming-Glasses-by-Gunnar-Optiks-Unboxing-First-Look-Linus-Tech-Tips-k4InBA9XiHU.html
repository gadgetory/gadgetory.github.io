been curious about for the longest time
this is SteelSeries gaming I wear
develop with Gunnar optics so the claim
and there are many claims about these
glasses is that they will reduce the
overall eye fatigue and eyestrain
associated with using a computer monitor
for prolonged periods of time so I don't
know if you guys know this but probably
on a daily basis I use a computer
monitor for me anywhere from about 8 to
12 hours so it's a very very long time
and that causes some fatigue on my eyes
especially at work where I've got three
24-inch monitors and then a fourth
17-inch monitor it's a lot of
eye-gouging brightness and light that is
that is making me feel tired so one of
the things that I did do recently is
even though I have a very mild
prescription I tried getting some
glasses to see if not would make my eyes
feel overall less tired all the time so
far it hasn't really made a difference
I've had them for a couple weeks the
next thing I wanted to try was using the
SteelSeries scope so that's the
particular one with oh yeah here glasses
now I'm going to make the overall
approach to this video fairly simple and
I'm just gonna outline all of the claims
that SteelSeries and Gunnar optics make
in addition to just unboxing and looking
at the product then what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna wear these glasses every time
I'm in front of a screen for at least a
week maybe listen why don't we say two
weeks let's say two weeks to get a feel
for whether my eyes actually experience
any difference and their fatigue level
so I'm actually cheating because there's
a lot of different stuff that they have
to say that
I've had their well why don't we start
with some of the included okay what is
this the digital performance I wear
something okay excellent out-of-the-box
non-prescription Gunnar eyewear is
highly recommended a solution for
contact wearers or post corrective
surgery parents patients crystalline and
amber lenses are precisely tuned with
plus 0.2 diopters for digital screen
viewing distance okay cool
yeah limited warranty okay uses in care
instructions so probably just basically
yeah be careful with them and use the
clean solution compatible with that okay
yeah that's like umpteen billion
different languages okay inside the box
we also find a nice little sleeve little
get everything on it okay we find a
separate box for the glasses themselves
and we will have to figure out how those
come on so what does SteelSeries are and
Gunnar okay so this is a collaborative
project here what do they have to say
about them so I've already outlined what
the overall effect is supposed to be but
let's talk a little bit about how they
say they work so number one is the tint
of the glasses so this is amber but they
capitalize some little letters and not
some of the other letters but these are
amber lenses and they're supposed to
reduce the amount of harsh bright blue
light and make everything up here with
more of a warm color so that is supposed
to reduce the key okay so that's the why
yellow at him the shape so the highly
wrapped curved lens is supposed to
retain eye moisture so rather than
having moisture evaporate away from your
eyes much more readily when you're not
wearing these glasses it is supposed to
allow them to retain some of it which
means that when you're not blinking for
a prolonged period of time let's say
when you're very very focused whether
it's on a spreadsheet or whether it's on
a game they are not supposed to dry out
as easily so that's one of the things
that
tamo truss actually mentioned when i
first went in complaining about eye
fatigue was make sure you're blinking
enough because i dryness can be one of
the leading causes of eye tiredness so
there's that
the proprietary lens material offers the
clearest image possible and comprised of
lightweight materials for long haul
ergonomics i can tell you guys right now
it's very very light the overall glasses
including the including the frames
extremely light coating so they're
designed to reduce glare and protect the
lens okay and to reflective coating i
guess you guys can be the judges of how
bad your reflective it is when i go like
this okay the fit organ ama clean design
the lens of creme solution striking
elizabeth's lightweight okay once again
lightweight yet durable so let's have a
look at how they're made so those are
the hinges right there I'd say you still
have to be careful with them they're
still glasses they got kind of a neat
carbon fiber finishing thing going on
here but the good news about these is
that check this out so with my actual
like you know fitted proper prescription
glasses you guys can see how much this
one sits up off the table because my
ears are crooked so whenever I wear
glasses that are just kind of off the
off the rack so to speak the only way
that they fit me properly and evenly is
if they grip the head a little bit and
these ones do grip they do hold on just
like my just like my my sunglasses but
they don't grip too much they're not
uncomfortable so that's that's a good
thing as well okay and the benefit for
gamers so improves visual efficiency
with the change in the tint coding
focusing power and curvature okay
improve visual endurance improve visual
recovery keep your eyes fresh and
relaxed
okay minimizes eye strain so you can get
them with a prescription although the
ones that are available to just like buy
online are going to be the non
prescription ones so if you already have
corrective lenses such as contacts these
are going to be ideal for you and but
yeah if you go to Gunnar optics you can
actually get them directly from them
with
trips and lenses and oh this is me so
heads that compatible that's a really
good point because most glasses whether
there are 3d vision glasses for example
or whether they are prescription glasses
are often a bit of a pain with a headset
and I wish I had a headset on me but you
can see how flat to my head needs it so
I can't imagine there'd be any
difficulty with a headset but when I do
my impressions video I will definitely
try a headset between now and then so I
can let you guys know so ya expect an
update for me anywhere from sort of
let's say two weeks to a month from now
I'll give them a really low prolonged
trial to see how they go and I will let
you guys know sort of once and for all
from someone who gets very very bad eye
fatigue just from using a computer so
much whether these things are actually
worth the fairly hefty ticket price so
thank you for checking out this unboxing
and first look because we're going to
need a much longer look and don't forget
