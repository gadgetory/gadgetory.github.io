everything this pile here has been
catalogued by Justin already in our
inventory okay okay I'm still trying to
come down from that adrenalin chill down
that's why you got us all cranked
because you got us all fired up man
we're all energetic moving time
Corsair delivers real neck or nothing
with their strafe mechanical keyboards
featuring genuine Cherry MX key switches
made in Germany click on this spot right
here to learn more no move it in the
corner get two in the corner
got the hi-tech get out of their home is
so tennis hero for lumber okay guys
let's make a cardboard pile a
broken-down card more just kind of on
the lawn Oh
moving the oil pieces yeah this has not
been since it was built
oh it's heavy
wow that's heavy under it something
ah careful with that painting under
script
everything about this is high-stakes
what an exhausting day
never trust moving anything with Dennis
you keep hitting this is a lot of your
career as a professional mover this was
supposed to be the random accessories
and now it's like helmets like I'm gonna
need someone to come with me
there's a laptop in here I thought this
was an empty box
it's a g7 51 it has a gtx 980m in it we
didn't know we had that oh we supposed
to send it back so was it worth it to me
having the entire company in the dark
about the fact that we were going to
move today for the sake of a cruel prank
yes yes it was so I forgot for a minute
that I should be driving really really
slow cuz things are only somewhat secure
it in the back look at this guy not
letting me in what a check
oh I guess like a handicap sign in the
window I feel bad for calling him a
jackass let's find out if we broke
anything on the way over here this is
looking pretty good that's why big I
pull out some racking it's the u-haul so
Hey look here's a small update the
adducting for the AC is almost to the
roof now did we get rid of the fire pole
so if this is a camera stuff shelf then
we might as well just put camera stuff
on it kind of thing no I was gonna take
a tallit full I always move the heavy
stuff by myself not just when the
cameras rolling he's lying do you want
these cards done individually or do you
want to just like kind of as a bundle
listen the slack ass guys like goes you
want these cards uh inventory one by one
or can I just say like bucket of AMD
cards bucket of Nvidia cards yeah that's
yeah that's an inventory system this is
gonna take a while yeah like how many
people can identify what this card is
well just MSI it's just MSI it literally
has nothing else on it
do you think Luke can park a trailer
he backed up that trailer like only
someone experienced in the art of
backing it up
could they claim the inspection is
Friday that really doesn't look like
it's going to be inspection ready in
three days unchanged but but do I go
like didn't build it
I just stopped what was potentially the
largest security breach in Lynas Media
Group history
Brandon's post-it note with all of his
passwords on the bottom of his desk day
one is almost behind us and you'd hardly
freaking recognize this place I forgot
there were windows behind the green
screen
I now realize why I thought there was so
much space in this place to run the
business here when I first looked at it
because when it's empty it looks like
there is hell it was one of six there's
so much room for activities down here
mines your room basically porn torn down
the furnitures gone all that remains of
the editors is the evidence I'm mad at
you about my M&amp;amp;Ms benchmarking den these
guys tore down their shelf pour out all
the rig's empty deposit it's not like
it's kind of like at like a shantytown
kind of look except that all the stuff
is legitimately like super cool instead
of just being like you know rusty truck
parts
speaking of moving all week you move
around and when you do you may or may
not have a cell phone
ting com visit Linus ENCOM to try out
their savings calculator why would you
need a savings calculator well to
calculate the money you'll be saving
basically the way ting works is they
bill only what you use and then what you
do is you take your prepackaged plan
which probably has a bunch of stuff
you're not even using in it you enter
all that into the savings calculator
then you go ahead and you enter how much
you're paying and ting spits out a
number
bippity bop if you save money then you
can switch to ting very easily by
heading over to Linus ting dot-com
they'll even throw in a credit if you
are locked into an existing contract up
to $75 and by using our link you'll get
a credit towards a new device or your
first bill as well so again that's Linus
10.com in the video description and then
this is our second low
this time we bought the majority of the
Rings so in the back are most of the
editing workstations everyone but
Terrans on test benches there's one
server that we're moving now and then
we've got like the chair orgy about
grapefruit in there it's been a really
long day so I stay tuned for more moving
vlog it's going to be exciting and like
and subscribe and all that standard
stuff that I do what is it dislike if
you disliked and like subscribe and
check out our cool like t-shirts and
monthly contributions and Amazon
affiliate code and all that good stuff

scheduled programming very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
