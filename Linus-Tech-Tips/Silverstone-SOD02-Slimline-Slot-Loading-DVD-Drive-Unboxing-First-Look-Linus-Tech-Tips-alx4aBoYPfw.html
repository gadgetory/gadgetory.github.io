the silverstone SST which stands for
silverstone tech right duh s od0 - this
is an optical disk drive made by LG so
you know if you're worried of that you
know it's like some kind of off-brand
optical drive or something not at all
the reason silverstone has this SKU in
their arsenal is because they have a lot
of really cool small form factor cases
that require things like slimline
optical drives or slot-loading optical
drives to make them more elegant and to
make them look better and all that kind
of stuff but Silverstone is not actually
an optical drive manufacturer so what
they do is they source a bunch of these
from LG and then they offer them to
their customers so that they can
complete their silverstone build
experience so here's a quick manual and
it says drive by Toshiba Samsung well
those aren't all the same thing oh I
guess it must it used to be Toshiba
Samsung and now it's LG because this
sticker is over top of that one Oh
interesting okay well there you go
apparently they source them from sort of
wherever has a good slimline
slot-loading optical and then don't
worry too much about it they just put a
sticker on the box that's not--that's
that's fine so it comes with mounting
screws there you go
comes with a SATA cable oh is this what
it comes with a very special SATA cable
so this is one of those smaller notebook
form factor SATA combo connectors and
then that breaks out to a SATA cable
that plugs into your motherboard and a
power connector that plugs into your
power supply because these slimline
optical drives are intended for things
like external enclosures and notebooks
and not really intended for desktops
unless you're talking very very small
form-factor desktops like the kind that
we are about to do a build with this guy
with so that's why we needed it so there
you basically go I mean there's a couple
mounting holes on the sides there's
mounting holes on the other sides
there's that special connector there's
the slot load and the eject button here
which is great and that's oh look it is
an LG right no okay yeah that's
what we concluded so it's an LG multi GA
331 and however I suspect that they that
they change a fair bit and I really am
running out of things to say thank you
