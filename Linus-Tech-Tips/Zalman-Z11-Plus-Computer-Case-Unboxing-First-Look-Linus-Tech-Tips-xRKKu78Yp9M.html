happened to this box I have no idea what
happened to this box almond dropped it
off and was like hey can you check out
this case and I was like sure with
somebody like eating the side of the box
they said we don't know so we're gonna
open this up and find out if in spite of
the fact that this case has apparently
been shipped to and from the depths of
hell at least once
whether it is in okay shape on the
inside this is the Zelman z11 plus it is
an ATX mid tower case with a front mesh
cover for ultra cooling performance it
supports up to seven system fins
supports the bottom PSU installation and
aperture for cable management really I
think they mean cable management holes
black interior coatings almonds powerful
HDD cooling solution tool free hard
drive installation spacious interior for
installing up to two hundred and ninety
millimeter or twenty nine centimeter
video cards actual tuning side panel I
think they mean windowed side panel
supports two USB 3 ports front and
bottom dust filters doing a half inch
hard drive SST mount on the rear side of
the motherboard tray tray place plate
tray separate apertures for convenient
CPU cooler installation I think they
need a CPU cutout and three and one
bracket provided rear tube apertures for
liquid cooling systems somebody thinks
that aperture is an appropriate synonym
for hole in this case and you could make
that argument but I don't think that
that's really what they meant all right
here we go so we've got a hard foam
while it isn't my favorite it is
extremely thick very robust and the case
did by all appearances managed to arrive
in one piece one thing came loose though
so I'm just gonna check this out here
okay so this is just a little guy that
goes in the front right here that's a
three and a half
I think that has to be installed from
the inside so I'm not going to try for
too long at this because that will be
boring for you to watch so we'll fix
that after we'll just leave it up you
know so this is the z11 plus this is
actually kind of a slick looking case it
looks to have a lot of spaces back there
is the smoked side panel window so it is
not a 100% clear it is for more of a
dark and subdued look if you do put red
lighting it looks really really good
with smoked dark side panels like this
we also have in terms of okay here I got
to stay stay focused here it's late and
I'm tired so take this off so that is
protecting what appears to be a tray for
storing like you know screws and I don't
know like pocket change
like SSDs you might happen to have lying
around you could store them there um I
know this isn't the first role problem
right where am I going to store my SSD
that's lying around um moving along we
have two front USB 3 ports a reset
switch a hard drive indicator LED to
front USB 2.0 ports headphone and
microphone jack and really business do
anything no doesn't okay power switch
right here and a power LED under the
power switch now ventilation wise at the
front we have almost a full mesh thing
going on except where there are
ventilation grilles
so it's grills or it's mesh or its
apertures whatever you want to call it
there is a lot of ventilation on this
case so here we can see a front 140
millimeter fan that is a filtered fan
spot and it looks like this does come
off give me a second here guys it looks
like we're going to be able to take this
off more easily once we get the case
open so we'll have a closer look at that
as well as their unique harddrive
cooling solution which uses these vent
holes here on either side to move air
actively directly over your hard drive
so the side panels are pretty
run-of-the-mill steel construction with
the plastic sort of aggressive car
looking venting thing going on as well
as the the bulging out window that
actually serves
only an aesthetic purpose but also a
practical purpose because you can
install very tall CPU coolers in this
case without any difficulty at the back
you see here that ok from the front it
looks very more like with fewer holes in
it and then from the back you can see
that there is ample room for airflow
coming from the inside of the case to be
exhausted out the back at the back we
actually see we've got a 120 millimeter
cooling fan 7 PCI slots bottom mounted
power supply and I think all of this was
covered when I was checking out the
specs on the box itself however here we
are reiterating it because I need to buy
time while I take off these screws take
off the side panel so here we go that
appears to be a 80 mm that appears to be
an 80 millimeter exhaust fan which is
pulling air directly from over the hard
drives and then exhausting that out here
very cool
plugs in with a 4-pin molex peripheral
connector over all side panel
construction is actually fairly solid
not bad at all alright once we oh you
know what here I took these screws off
so I'm sure to have that fall off if I
don't do something with it now this one
is also exhaust so both of them are
pulling air from that front intake fan
and then exhausting them out the case
and this one also plugs in with a 4-pin
molex peripheral connector and do two
like this this plastic piece here once
again it feels quite it's quite solid
overall a unique design actually very
cool alright so there is the front 140
millimeter fan that I was talking about
and then here is the tool this hard
drive installation mechanism so you just
use these pull these out if you want to
take out your drives in fact we should
probably go grab a drive just so that we
can show you assuming I have one lying
around which apparently I do so if your
probably if your first roll problem
happens to be where to store the hard
drives that you have lying around
look is telling me something I don't
know something about screws give me a
minute all right so slick tells me this
is how I do it I don't know if you can
necessarily call this tool this but
there you go
you slide in like that and then this
piece is pulled out in order to remove
the drive you can also ah there we go
put in an additional screw for added
security if you're worried about the
drive coming out however you will lose
some of the anti vibration vibration
dampening effects of the rubber mounts
if you do actually happen to do it that
way
ah what else have we got here in terms
of accessories so it comes with an 8 pin
extender this is actually a phenomenal
value add these cost anywhere from about
five to ten bucks to buy so it comes
with the case for a bottom mounted power
supply that actually isn't even in that
tall in the case so if you have a decent
power supply you just use this and then
like save one of these for a rainy day
all right we got a couple PCI back
plates including one that is set up for
these USB 3 cables which plug into the
back that's a little bit disappointing
I've expect at some point they'll revise
this case to use an internal header but
for now it isn't using one we've also
got all of our mounting screws a couple
cable ties as well as a boatload of
thumb screws that look like they would
be useful for all kinds of things
including mounting drives so these guys
are threaded with fine threads guys so
no I don't think you're I don't think
you're right I don't think it's far that
slick I think it's for mounting the
motherboard I could be wrong though
let's find out yeah I think these are
actually for mounting the motherboard
cool because all the standoffs are in
here as well I actually really like the
look of mounting the motherboard with
thumb screws there's no reason you can't
do it in any case but as long as you
have screws that are threaded correctly
for your standoffs but I think it looks
for the sharp so there's a user's manual
and let's get moving with the case
itself here we go so in terms of the
fans you can mount in this thing you
ton of different options so there's the
front fat there's the two of other fans
that come with it to cool your hard
drives there's also room for up to
another two 120 or 140 millimeter
exhaust fans up here on the top a 120 in
the back a 120 or 140 with a filter so
that's going to be an intake on the
bottom there's your power supply fan
which is also filtered that's good and
then finally you can install another fan
on the back of the on the back of the
motherboard where your video card is so
that will actually four okay this is
interesting because for video cards that
use aftermarket computers like this one
where they actually blow a lot of the
heat down towards your motherboard
cooling the back of the board is
something that could be very useful I've
never seen that feature before so that's
a that's an interesting touch wow what
else we got here right all your included
internal connectors so your front power
switch and LEDs and all that whatnot
whoo-ha as well as your internal USB 2
header and then your internal USB or
rather your external USB 3 cables so
those ones are going to go around to the
back of the motherboard and plug in
right there using that PCI slot
pass-through we have a fairly large CPU
cut out some pre-installed motherboard
standoffs although you'll have to put in
the rest yourself that's fine because
this is pretty much what you need for
ITX then 4ma TX or ATX you're going to
go ahead and expand how many you have in
there five and a quarter inch bays I
actually never did count those we've got
five of them with one of them would be
three and a half inch adapter that that
piece was missing from before these are
all filtered so they have foam in them
which will keep dust from accumulating
from air that is sucked in through the
front of the case overall construction
is actually fairly solid considering
what a value this cases though they
haven't they haven't cheaped out on the
on the overall build quality of it it
feels very solid which means it may not
be as much of a factor when it's just a
case but once you load it up with a
bunch of heavy hardware especially if
you're going to ship it anywhere the
cases that aren't built as well tend to
show very quickly where the problems
exist so if you are doing things
like reinforcing the motherboard tray
with these kinds of bends which
incidentally also gives you a lot of
different cable routing options are that
Salman has incidentally given you cable
routing options as well has all these
different places to tie down cables it's
those little nice touches that make a
case much easier to work with and much
more solid look at this look at all
these cable hold downs these are more
handy than you'd think because there
isn't a ton of room on the back of this
motherboard tray for cable routing so
being able to lay everything down flat
and cable manage it cleanly is going to
be the difference between a tidy case
with all the cables running up the back
and an awful looking cable manage case
with the cables running up the front I
think that pretty much covers it so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the Zalman z11 plus
don't forget to subscribe to Ana's tech
tips from law boxing's reviews and other
computer videos slick burned me that's
the SSD mount on the back of the
motherboard tray that is not for a fan
although you know you could put a hole
in the other side panel and you could
put a fan there if you really wanted to
if you wanted to execute my
well-intentioned plan of cooling the
motherboard near the PCI slots better
you could do that or you could just
install your SSD here and run your cable
around here to your motherboard and it
would look very tidy and clean and that
would be a good thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
