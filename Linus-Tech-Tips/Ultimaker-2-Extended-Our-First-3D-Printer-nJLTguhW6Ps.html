FDM or fused deposition modeling printer
from ulta maker called the ultime Kerr
extended to we're a little late to the
game in terms of 3d printing but that's
because honestly just printing from
Shapeways was always kind of a great
solution for us Ultima car offers us to
an Ulta maker to to send to us and it's
kind of too badass to deny so hang out
to watch Tara and I print some random
stuff and please like the video for more
3d printing stuff in the future I would
love to do more videos on this subject
but I need your guys's support in order
to do that so yes I'm begging for likes
please like and share this video
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
click now to learn more so first off
what is an FDM printer essentially what
happens is it squirts filament out of a
hot end and lays down layers on layers
and layers on layers of the stuff to
eventually create your modeled object
this type of printer is typically what
you would find for a home you style
printing scenario not necessarily
industrial applications as they would
very likely have a much larger printer
with a different printing style that
being said this isn't a cheap printer
you could go pick up a cheap 3d printing
kit for like what like 500 bucks plus or
minus a couple hundred but when you get
into the really fancy high-end printers
like this it can get really expensive
for example this guy is about 2700 ish
u.s. dollars with an expensive printer
you get a much bigger print volume
meaning that the bed you print on is
relatively large and especially with the
extended version that we have the object
you can print can actually be quite tall
you will get a better print resolution
in terms of speed and precision so
you'll get a better looking print in the
end with less of those obvious levels
from where it was moving you get a
machine that doesn't make as much loud
aggressive noises and then the rest of
the improvements are largely going to be
more subtle and hard to detect things
that are actually still very important
those things are like the specific
bearings that were used the hot end the
steppers the belts and their tightness
etc which will both contribute to the
longevity of your printer and the
quality of the final print I wouldn't
say that ultime kerttu is an entry-level
printer if it's your first foray into
the 3d printing world I might start with
something cheaper but for the high-end
printing buff this may be your target
now without further ado let's get to
some printing the first thing I tried to
print was a little GoPro handle my idea
for this was that it wasn't an overly
complicated print for a first print and
it would actually be useful in our day
to day work on the modeling side of
things I just downloaded this small
but in the future I could just take the
bit off the end that connects to the
GoPro and model whatever I want behind
it so we can make specifically tailored
GoPro mounts relatively quickly and
inexpensively which is awesome I created
two of these one at maximum quality and
the other at minimum quality the maximum
quality one took just over four hours
minimum quality just took over an hour
and a half one thing I'd like to note
here is that the time the Ultimaker
shows on itself is incredibly inaccurate
but if you're using the cura slicing
software it will give you a pretty
accurate time estimate before you start
the print next up we started printing
the fire poles which were conceptualized
by me and then designed and modeled by
Taryn the first one was very small model
that we built with scaffolding enabled
this was an interesting print because of
how much of the printing platform was
extended over an overhang the printer
made quite a mess with the supports
after a very minor amount of work I was
able to cut the excess away and the
final product looked quite good but it
was still a little funky next up we
printed one of that was four times as
large as the previous fire pole this was
an interesting print for a few reasons I
turned off the scaffolding and Taryn
took the top plate off and built it on
the side which makes way more sense
while adding notches so that we could
put it together later on the reason for
this was to avoid the scaffolding mess
we had earlier and to see how accurate
the printer was when making small
intricate notches and this last one oh
look at that that's really good awesome
it didn't take much sanding the only
issue we ran into here was the top of
the fire pole platform sat on the heated
bed for so long that it actually started
warping an unfortunate and avoidable
problem if you take the right
precautions but I wasn't experienced
enough yet next up we have the first
part of a shroud that will be used in a
build logs lioness is doing for a 1u
server the shard was conceptualized and
modeled by Taryn and this print went on
without a hitch and it was impressive to
see the printer deal with a slanted edge
that easily then I tried to do a few
prints of some random things and change
the filament before the last big print
which is where disaster struck the
printer started acting really weird and
due to my inexperience I wasn't able to
identify what was going on and after
about five hours of troubleshooting I
was getting close to giving up there
seemed like there was a separate problem
with every freaking part of the printer
but with the help of twitch chat who
affectionately named the printer Darren
and had been watching for about 20 plus
hours at this point at twitch.tv slash
Luke underscore lef our shameless plug
and specifically the user more fiend Li
I was able to finally solve the various
problems that were going on and keep on
printing I have to give alta maker a
point here because even though I had a
vast amount of inexperience it was
actually pretty easy to kind of take
things apart and tinker with them to try
to identify the problem so that's pretty
cool the last leg on this journey was
the large part of the shroud that I
mentioned Taryn had modeled earlier for
the server at this point both I and the
twitchchat
had learned a lot more about 3d printers
and things ran smoothly or are running
smoothly as they're still about half an
hour left on that 18 hour print in
conclusion 3d printers are great but
this whole process is rather expensive
and at this point on the practicality or
hobby side it's definitely both but I'd
see it leaning more towards towards
hobby it will eventually be a practical
tool for your house but right now unless
you have the extra cash I don't know if
you want to get ahead of the game it
might be a good idea I could see these
being standard-issue devices in people's
homes in the near future and I'm sure
Ulta maker will be here to see that
happen as the ultimate kerttu is a thing
of beauty in both aesthetics and an
engineering viewpoint tunnel bear they
