on this one this is almost a retro
unboxing at this point but big thanks to
Microsoft hardware for making this
particular unboxing possible and I will
be unboxing the Xbox 360 special edition
which comes with Tom Clancy's Splinter
Cell Conviction a couple of controllers
and the 250 gig hard drive so the first
thing we're going to do is figure out
how the box opens there appears to be a
seal here go ahead and find a screw
driver I lost my unboxing knife again so
jump in well I'll do just that the box
and see if Microsoft has to say anything
for themselves about this particular
piece of kit although I think everyone
pretty much knows what an Xbox 360 is
all about at this point in time
contents 250 gig hard drive two wireless
controllers full version of the game
black headset compass at AV cable
standard definition and an Ethernet
cable there's a QuickStart guide says
start here shows you how to plug the
Xbox 360 in it shows you how to put
batteries in the controllers okay shows
you how to put a game disc in very nice
opening it up further we see the Xbox
360 itself including a little ad for
Xbox Live Xbox Live spring more brings
more of the entertainment you love right
to your living room with thousands of HD
movies TV episodes free game demos and
game add-ons like songs characters and
levels plus you can connect and play
with friends wherever they happen to be
the fun never ends Connect today it's
free the Xbox Live Gold membership
however does cost money ok it also has a
little add for the wireless song our
dongle that allows you to
use your xbox 360 or wirelessly rather
than using Ethernet so here's the unit
at soft which we will look at in a
moment alright
explore your Xbox 360 manual and then
care for your Xbox 360 warranty ok
documentation very fun stuff analyst
interesting there's the game so there's
a copy of Splinter Cell Conviction here
and some accessories so the first thing
we see here is a power brick very large
power brick but that's to be expected
it's a very powerful piece of hardware
got some cooling vents on it big shiny
plastic power plug for the wall power
plug for the back of the Xbox 360
alright and then we have these power
plugs that goes in to the back of that
power brick there you go just like that
next you have an Xbox 360 controller and
it comes with batteries look at that
Duracell batteries even like who does
that who includes high quality batteries
with battery operated hardware these
days nobody that's who
check that out I'm half expecting them
to be like expired or something hold on
let's see oh they are 2009-11 so ok well
they tried Wow next we've caught
a hmm what is this next we've got okay
so there's the AV cable so that goes
into the back of the Xbox you can see
there's only a couple pins actually
being used by this particular one I
would definitely recommend with a high
def console like this using a proper
high definition cable I mean they're not
expensive you can buy them on NCIX for
just a couple bucks for an HDMI cable so
I wouldn't worry too much about it let's
see if our next set of batteries here
has expired yet these are roughly the
same time you know what expired
batteries will probably still work it's
not like they're gonna blow up they just
probably won't last as long although
what I really recommend for basically
anything that takes double A's is
getting yourself some sanyo eneloop
batteries they're really not expensive
when you add up how many times they
recharge how long the battery life lasts
and how many disposable batteries you
don't have to buy when you go with these
sanyo eneloop comes with a pretty
quality looking ethernet cable with
gold-plated connectors
looks like about a six foot cable
alright and next we've got the headset
that is included so it's got one year
here you got your microphone there and
then you have a connector that plugs
into the bottom of your controller
alright two wireless controllers
included with this one that's pretty
handy because a console is not nearly as
much fun if you can't really
head-to-head with your friends and let's
have a look at the unit itself so on the
side here we have our ventilation holes
which are going to allow natural
convection to cool the unit so you can
see air will be just drawn by the heat
rising through the unit through these
bottom holes and then it will be
expelled at the top out the other more
different top and finally out the third
top of the console at the back here you
can see our output options and input so
we have one USB cable here we have our
Ethernet here we've got HDMI out here
that is definitely the one I would
recommend using and finally we have our
AV out right here we've got a couple of
cooling fans at the back so those are
for your less natural conduction
and those are going to be allowing you
to pull air into all of those
perforations and blow them out the back
of the unit finally we have the power
supply that plugs in right here so
that's going to distribute power to all
the various parts including the CPU and
the GPU that are going to power your
favorite games here we have slots for
memory cards we have an infrared
receiver and we have the here we go
optical drive which is where you put
your games including if I can get it
yeah there we go
an eject button right there power
buttons here and last but not least
we've got a couple of USB ports in the
front so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and really actually is my first
close look at an Xbox 360 I'm not much
of a console guy normally so I'm usually
gaming on my PC but now that I've got my
hands on this guy I'll have to give it a
shot let you guys know how it goes don't
