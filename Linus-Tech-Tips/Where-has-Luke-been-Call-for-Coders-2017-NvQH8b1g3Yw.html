conspicuously absent from the channel
for a while now since PAX East for
videos on our channel that aren't the
wine show or don't involve everyone in
the company Linus has hosted 22 of them
and I have hosted a grand total of two
am I getting fired am i getting phased
out in favor of clickbait topics and
crazy thumbnails I've been reading your
comments and I do appreciate your
concern and kind words but no nothing
dramatic I have been voluntarily RIA
comma dated two projects floatplane and
I want you to join me so what the heck
is floatplane well answer that question
but first a seemingly unrelated broader
statement the trend today's for social
platforms to grow user count at all
costs this is how they attract online
creators and build loyalty to their
platform it makes sense the problem with
this model for creators is that this
loyalty is pretty much a gun to the head
that says abandon us and you'll lose
everything that you worked for as a
creator losing your platform is like
losing your job in a field where people
are often self-employed covering their
own costs for things like medical
insurance
that's a scary prospect the problem for
the audience is that social platforms
usually have their own agenda with
respect to big data which is a deeper
conversation for another time these
things motivate them to make changes to
their algorithm that can benefit the
service but harm the viewer creator
relationship like delivering trending
videos to an activity feed rather than
the content that was actively followed
or subscribed to or in another more
topical example they might just up and
turn off monetization because their
advertising partners aren't fans of a
particular style of content fair or not
this pulls the rug out from under
creators fee so in the short term our
goal with floatplane is very simple
we're going to take over the galaxy
or failing that we'll build a platform
for online content creators to deliver
their content directly to their
audiences without the restrictions
imposed by traditional services in a
long term however floatplane media's
more general mission is to develop
really cool tools to reduce online
creators dependence on a single social
platform and give them more time and
resources to create while enriching the
experience for their loyal communities
with stable elegant apps it's win-win so
even if it doesn't soar it probably
won't sync because it's a floatplane so
the past few months we've had a
pre-alpha riding on the back of our
forum with early access streaming
downloading mostly working and the CMS
and transcoding systems hobbling along
but that's not the kind of future-proof
solution that we ultimately want and
that's where you come in the true
version of our metaphorical floatplane
needs a lot more work before we can
start showing it off to the pilots we
need another software engineer or
computer scientist to join the team and
help us make magic this will involve
brainstorming creative and innovative
ways to tackle the myriad of issues that
come with developing this type of
platform communicating with our team of
to Canadians on each end of the country
some guy in the UK another dude in
Sweden and possibly even some one
hanging out in Belgium extensive
documentation and commenting practices
to make it possible for others to work
on the code that you write in the future
and coordinating with our team members
to make sure that what we're building
will actually function at the end of the
day and more in terms of the
requirements we have for your abilities
you need to have strong nodejs
JavaScript and WebSocket skills along
with professional software development
experience the more the better we don't
require a degree or piece of paper that
says that you know how to code but you
must roughly have the equivalent coding
knowledge of a post-secondary graduate
how you got it is your business for
bonus points it would be great to have
experience working in agile development
teams experience working on complex
multi-layer applications and
microservices experience with web
transcoding and a passion for
interactive media modern web content
creations and building communities
we're mainly recruiting for a developer
that can do server client relations
handling in node but as a software
engineer at flow clean media you will be
modifying and hacking additional
functionality into pre-existing systems
and creating some new ones from scratch
some of the many things you may be
working on include the video
distribution systems both for
downloading and streaming the comments
and chat systems tools for creators to
manage and improve their pages and
interact with their audiences elegant
highly available web services to support
our front-end platform front-end web
engineering that is functional beautiful
and has a premium feel
applications for one of the many non web
platforms that we do plan to support in
the future including iOS Android
consoles and more agile tools for
internal or external use that let us
support our customers and partners for a
better overall experience for everyone
and lots more features that we haven't
thought of yet so after all that if
you're interested there's a Google Form
linked under the video that I'd like
everyone to fill out before going any
further after we spend some time
collecting those successfully completed
forms there will be further instructions
that will include where to send a resume
cover letter and portfolio along with
the details of a timed coding challenge
that we will be holding which I think
will be a fun way to help you stand out
from the crowd
if you want to be on the ground floor of
making something awesome that people
will actually use and enjoy I would
encourage you to join me and together we
can rule the galaxy as father and son
or possibly daughter</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
