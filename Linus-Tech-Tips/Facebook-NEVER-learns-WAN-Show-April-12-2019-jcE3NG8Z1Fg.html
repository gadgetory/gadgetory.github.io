weird isn't it it's crazy it's like
someone isn't here we've got some pretty
interesting topics this week valve to
address review bombing in new update to
user review systems interesting also
even potentially more interesting
Facebook patent to use user adds user
photos as ads hmm also Amazon workers
may be listening to you through your
echo device
all this and more roll the intro Wow
it's Friday
Squarespace bites a private Internet
access
t.i and I'm trying to do this thing over
here displayed display just brought a
diss plate this play right here this
plate behind me let me just make sure
this thing is going looks like it is and
we're back we're back baby there we go
see this plate yes well we'll get to
that but first valve addressing review
bombing you see this pretty often
actually review bombing that is yeah
tell us about it
so like a new game will come up
especially for smaller games where like
a hundred two hundred reviews is gonna
be a very significant portion of the
reviews on the platform you will see
Brigade Inge
we're like a group of people decide that
they don't like or that they do like
I've actually I believe review bombing
has happened in the other direction as
well it's something it's probably more
more common on like we knew but it's
basically up voting it let's get this to
the front page yeah yeah yeah just just
like how on Amazon people can buy
positive reviews I don't necessarily
know if this stuff is purchased but
you'll get a group of people that
whether they've really played a game or
not they've like one minute on record a
practice thing ever very positive review
yeah I think I think it goes in in both
directions and the ways that valve wants
to address this I think are pretty
interesting this is driving me nuts
there's these headphones that are
plugged in right now and everything we
say is coming out of it all and I can
just vaguely to hear it on the side when
you're review bombing happens yeah it's
not usually when the game comes out or
is it sometimes just rattling like five
years later yeah it can happen way later
down the line too
one of the interesting ones it's like a
patch will come out more an expansion or
something and then it'll get tanked at
that point in time and on Steam you can
see all-time and recent so if you're
viewing a game in like the all-time is
very positive but the recent is like
very negative that's pretty bad as well
so it can take a surprisingly low amount
of reviews to really sway people's
perceptions because if you have enough
people to slam a game that's decently
old but you can make the recent go to
very positive or very
or whatever way you want to push it you
can really affect people's decisions on
things so where are those brigades
organized so usually happen on the
subreddit for the game or escort or
gaming subreddits gaming disk right
there's a bunch of different ways I
think there's also a little bit where
like this is almost more of a mentality
thing I think there's two so I think
there's two other things around to is is
one if you're like I'm not really sure
and then you see the game and it has
mixed reviews you'll probably go yeah
and give it a mixed review you're like
yeah I'm not really sure but everyone
else is reading it very positive you
might go like it was pretty all right
well I think there's some that happens
where it's just things are swayed but
another problem that they're going after
is something that I saw on and this
actually pissed me off I saw this on a
local review of mucho burrito recently
okay
some guy rated at one star because he
ordered some mucho burrito from skip the
dishes and the like delivery was late or
something ah that's that's a completely
unrelated thing and one of the ways that
valve wants to address this is to this
is actually exactly what they're talking
about yeah with this new announcement
want to deal with off topic review right
so let's just like to introduce it in
terms of the article yeah
so in an effort to keep games review
scores which is something we didn't talk
about yet is not only are people leaving
reviews but the reviews they leave are
contributing to an overall review score
and in an effort to keep the game's
review scores as a meaningful indicator
for whether or not someone should buy
the game valve is now rolling out a new
review system for steam that detects
off-topic review bombing and removes the
impact of these reviews from the games
review store important distinction there
they are not removing the reviews the
reviews are staying on there you can
still read all yeah they're just
removing the contribution of those
reviews to the overall score it's not
fair
let's say there's a lot of the off topic
DRM things are like or about DRM yeah
yeah
or is this in steams estimation here
they have a little criteria I do
that should affect it personally but
well this is the meat of this topic it's
the gray area so we've already defined
for you what a review bomb is now let's
talk about what an off topic review bomb
is Steam says when the focus of those
reviews is on a topic that valve
considers unrelated to the likelihood
that future purchasers will be happy if
they buy the game and hence not
something that should be added to the
review score okay yeah see cuz like if
we if we pull this away from gaming
temporarily if you want to review
something on like Rotten Tomatoes and
you went to go review hellboy which is
currently 11 out of 100 and you were
like thinking about it in both sides if
you want to rate a movie a zero or just
don't do it because it's Rotten Tomatoes
because you went to the theater and the
popcorn sucked yeah that would be really
stupid just like the skip the dish's
thing yeah if you wanted to review
Hellboy as definitely go watch it
because the popcorn was great that's
equally stupid so like I I'd like the
getting rid of off-topic things I am
going to be very interested in what they
deem as off-topic because the DRM thing
is extremely on topic in my opinion so
on their announcement blog there's a
section at the bottom underneath where
they outline what they're doing they
have a Q&amp;amp;A section and DRM is actually
specifically called out there and the Q
part is I care about some things that I
worry other players don't like DRM or
EULA changes review bombs have new the
changes are also super important review
bombs have been about them in the past
you consider them unrelated or off topic
and the answer is we have long it long
debates about these two and others like
them they're testing technically not
part of the game but they are an issue
for some players in the end we decided
to define them as off-topic because the
general Steam player doesn't care as
much about them
so the review score is more accurate if
it doesn't contain them in addition we
believe that players who do care about
topics like DRM are often willing to dig
a little deeper into games before
purchasing which is why we still keep
all
reviews within the review bumps it only
takes a minute to dig into those reviews
to see if the issue is something you
carry no one's gonna do well you they
they're saying that the fair enough I
just said that's really annoying to me
because games like I don't even know if
this was on Steam to be completely
honest but then newer Assassin's Creed
games origins I believe specifically had
a de nouveaux or something I think it
had like three different layers of DRM
and it was crippling I I did a stream of
that game when it first came out and ran
my like CPU usage statistics the entire
time I was playing and would like go
into different areas and look at things
it's about benchmarking it cuz I was
like holy crap this thing is thrashing
me way harder than it should be and it
was really interesting to to test that
doesn't mean it's a good game for people
because the system's getting thrashed
and I found it interesting it does not
mean it's good for the general person
but I do think a lot of people should
know because it's genuinely really hard
for people to run if they didn't have
yeah a decent enough so maybe don't buy
it
yeah so it's true and that even don't
buy the damn game and then there's
there's been was it a Kerbal space
program or something had a really weird
EULA update that made it so that like
yeah you probably shouldn't buy this
game oh wow I don't I don't I could be
super inflammatory saying Kerbal space
program
now I must know you list by EULA and
user License Agreement guys curl space
programs new EULA makes it spyware take
two is not quite the headline yeah I
don't know very much about this to be
completely clear and I think it's gonna
take quite a bit to dive into but my
stance is just going to be that you the
updates are very important okay and and
DRM stuff can be very important I think
I think people review bombing every
single every single game that comes out
that has DRM on it is like maybe a
little excessive but when people are
like the DRM implementation in this game
is ridiculous and extremely detrimental
and we should probably all get very
angry about this I think that's very
valid well luckily for people like you
and pose who share your opinion
you can completely opt out of this
entirely opt out so there's gonna be a
checkbox in I think it's there now there
is now a checkbox in your steam store
options where you can choose to have
off-topic review BOM still included in
all the review scores you see sweet cool
thank you for the option yeah sounds
good so we have a little bit more
information about how they're doing this
with their processes basically they made
some kind of a automated tool that looks
at the frequency of reviews so let's say
a game came out it's been out for two
years and suddenly it gets a huge number
of reviews it'll get flagged and that's
all the tool does the tool doesn't try
to figure out why or at all all it does
is say hey look at this anomalous
activity and then a team of humans will
then look at it okay and then these
people have already been trained at
looking at review bombs in the past or
off bombs in the past yeah so they can
determine I mean because there's review
bombs that are normal you know like a
lot of reviews because the game came out
today and yeah and we all love it yeah
all want everyone to buy read dead or
something
risk of rain to this dream was a claim
that had like almost no marketing and
then got positively review bummed if you
want to call it that because tons of
people that played it thought it was
amazing and then it sold really well it
was great here's another little wrinkle
when they determined that this a period
of time represents an off-topic review
bomb they don't have much sensitivity in
saying which are gonna stay in which are
gonna be deemed bad so it's like okay
this weekend this two-day period there's
people like you were getting review
bombed we're gonna remove all of those
reviews from contributing toward reviews
for well even if you just legitimately
happen to review that day and it was a
genuine review that's not about DRM or
EULA or something that they think is off
topic your your reviews gonna get this
kind of super bad my opinion yes it is
but I think it's a drop in the bucket
for the overall score but that's not
because that nullifies major
not really because then if so that
nullifies major EULA and DRM and
whatever else they decide is off topic
changes from being noticed by the
general public because most people are
not going to I will most people are not
going to go into their settings and make
it so that this thing doesn't apply to
them and most people if the crit let's
assume the Kerbal space program thing is
real I don't know I never looked into it
too deeply I just shared it to one of my
friends that plays the game and I don't
know but let's assume that it's spyware
now I don't know I probably
hypothetically I would want to know that
that EULA is technically unrelated or
whatever they called it so the recent
reviews would still show up as very
positive I believe because I believe
that's what curls space program is but
the recent reviews when that came out
made it very negative the score would be
positive the rear the written reviews
would still be negative yeah yeah but
most people aren't gonna scroll through
the reviews they're just gonna go oh all
time very positive a recent very
positive sounds good game looks
interesting let's go oh I think you just
understand what I'm saying mmm what I'm
saying is let's say everyone goes and
bombs it yeah and the score is unaltered
because they deemed it off topic what
I'm saying is if there happened to be a
guy who came in and just gave a review
during that same weekend and was like it
doesn't no no I know I know I know so
what I'm saying what that is like it
will nullify any of this news basically
because no yeah I guess cuz that's yeah
I know I guess what I'm saying it's
pretty off all right sounds good
I just I guess no salad yeah I just I
don't like the idea that you're
notifying everything because it will
make any major change that people like
that isn't directly related to game play
because I think that's effectively what
they're saying his only game play things
whatever get mentioned well they're not
explicitly saying that that might be
like de-facto with me yeah I definitely
but it feels like that's what it's gonna
end up being any problem that is ever
unrelated to game play I'm assuming at
this point it's just gonna disappear
so you're saying by saying that I think
you're indicating that the score is very
that's the main thing you look at as a
scheme user I would assume it's the main
thing that a lot of people look at
because it's the main thing that's
projected you when you go to a game on
the store let's let's try this out let's
look at risk of rain that's actually the
forecast for this week on Saturday okay
let's go to my screen risk of rain - it
doesn't have a recent because the game
just freakin came out so it makes sense
all reviews overwhelmingly positive
10,000 reviews I don't think most people
are gonna click on this they're just
gonna see overwhelmingly positive and go
great this game this video that's
auto-playing
looks interesting it's overwhelmingly
positive maybe scroll down and like you
to get through just upload my friends
play it whatever I think you have to go
pretty far recent updates about the game
key features system requirements more
like this what creators say or views
down here I don't think most people are
reading reviews right there they're
super buried I think you can get shuffle
sweet strawpoll this is going to be so
before we do this drop I'm gonna say
this is gonna be one of the more skewed
straw polls that we have because we're
gonna have a whole bunch of power users
what if it says a whole bunch of power
users are not reading reviews I'm
pushing back on that cuz I don't see
people to be a power user to read
reviews because I think we have such an
e-commerce culture now I always read the
views on Amazon I'm used to scrolling
all the way to the bottom of an Amazon
page to get to the reviews that's a good
point because usually I read all the
negative reviews on Amazon or I'll read
the run to one stars like you're making
a purchasing decision here I'm gonna
read a couple read the top you know top
positive top negative yeah that's see in
a straw poll I think you're right on
that one okay
do you read steam in all capitals before
when you're when you're interested in
buying like before you buy do you read a
couple reviews or do you just use the
overall score yeah I'm doing like a
little side test thing as I'm interested
so we're doing yes no and no but I do on
Amazon because that's my SATs you and
I'm wondering
if I'm weird or if that's your
definitely weird yeah but like I wonder
how much because did do you read reviews
for games on Steam well like if you've
already heard of a game and that's why
you're there then you don't really need
to read the reviews but that's that's
kind of what I'm talking really depends
on how many people are just browsing
when they're like I want to buy a game
and I'm just gonna browse the store and
just find something it seems like
usually it's word-of-mouth like people
you know who you game with or playing
that kind of game I browse quite a bit
sometimes you do word of mouth if I get
word of mouth about a product that's on
Amazon though I still very often read
the reviews if I get word of mouth what
a game on Steam I'll check the positive
negative thing because I want to know if
something recent did something bad to it
mmm because someone might have played a
game like Kerbal space program for
example hypothetically so I might have
played it and enjoyed it for like a year
and then this EULA thing comes out I
don't want to spyware a game so they
don't necessarily know that because
they've just been playing they're not
checking the store page there's one play
again so that I would be nice for me to
know and I just do a little quick check
and then move on
I wonder I'd like to see the stats on
how many people straight-up opted out of
this yes that would be really put that
in your next hardware survey even though
it's not Hardware tuck it in there how
long do we have to wait before we can
look at this poll I want to post it in
the YouTube chat really quick I'm trying
to get there do oh there's so many
interesting questions how do people get
new games because you're right like a
lot there's especially in the indie
space there's so many games that don't
have a lot of marketing but then you get
the buzz in other ways like apex legends
obviously they had influence or
marketing but then they do they had
millions of dollars in influencer
marketing yeah but a lot of people heard
about it from other people getting a
popular like I heard about it like on a
Monday when it was like over the weekend
two million people started playing this
game but that I think was a lot of
influencer marketing and then people
seen the influencers and then friends
telling each other
it just wasn't spammed and
here wait let's see okay results do you
know if a game is like has a weird did
that fix it hello did I fix it we're
having a text bill difficulty here
this should be good now is it okay well
we're good now okay it was twitch over
here only we were getting a nap it
didn't happen last time which is weird
but I ran my laptop minimum oh it's
night are you sure it's black magic you
take the other cards out well then I
don't know I think that's time to move
to the next topic here but yeah it
shouldn't take audio from there anyways
yeah let's move on Facebook patent thank
you for playing chat for letting me know
that was going on a new Facebook patent
reals that favorite is even more out of
touch than you could have ever had oh my
god
there's like you read us written so
basically what what's going on here is
there gonna have an AI thingamajig wait
hold on it's a patent so first of all
that's fair they're thinking about it
they patent it that doesn't mean they'll
ever become a product it's not a product
right now they're not doing it right now
yeah that's a good that's a very good
point but the idea is they could look
through profile photos on Facebook and
look for photos where someone is
prominently holding a product like a
coke can or a Doritos bad burritos bag
or whatever else where you can clearly
see the product and then they would be
able to use those photos they real
license those photos not to you by the
way but there would be the license of
those photos for ads on Facebook so they
would I they would use machine learning
algorithms to identify these photos I
think they already do have which would
probably not be that hard because you
just look for a logo and then they'll
train with certain domains first like I
can like snacks and stuff seems pretty
easy to start with clothing would be way
harder they'll do that later yeah but
they'll recognize these photos will
identify them and then they'll they'll
pitch certain clients like hey coca-cola
here's a bunch of photos of people
holding your product coca-cola would
then use those photos as ads that and
here's where I'm not clear would an ad
of me holding a coke can
go only to me and my friends or were to
go to the whole Facebook Network what we
have written here is from the article
did to do the patent filing suggests
that the adverts would only be targeted
to a persons Facebook friends if the
user had limited their private privacy
settings that way that that language
from that article anyway suggests that
the default would be that it goes to
everybody if your if your privacy
settings are public yeah I think it
would go to everybody I don't think I
don't really think that makes any sense
I don't think they would do that it does
make sense but if they found a
particularly good one like a fairly
professional photo yeah babe yeah they
might yeah I don't know seems weird that
I actually do see the business sense as
creepy as it is and how we're all mad
right now I could see why they would
pitch this as a product yeah I mean
colds completely blind to civilization
business man I completely get it as well
because you're showing someone their
friends that's cool consuming or using a
product that's what advertising it has
always been like associating the brown
with something you like and you're
likely forcing word-of-mouth this the
safe bet was always like okay use George
Clooney use someone we all like but now
because it's so personal there's this
walk hey I happen to know you're friends
with this person how about I just show
you them or even yourself like hey
remember a year ago and you had all that
fun eating those cheesie's get cheese
again man that was a good night I really
hope that this goes poorly and there's
like someone doing something bad with
the product this is exactly what I think
like oh look at real someone drinking
Grey Goose
that's my alcoholic friend yeah that
guy's not okay he's in rehab
yeah totally shoot yourself in the foot
how are they gonna know there's no way
for them to know I really yeah I really
really hope that if this does get put in
place which I hope it doesn't but if it
does I really hope it'd go sideways in
like glorious ways I don't see how they
could ever really implement this because
the the optics are so bad and then
that's obvious that's an obvious
downside
could easily happen easily happen or
like like you see the amount of times
that like what was that Microsoft ai
that people like made racist oh yeah
yeah is it like learn I'm from winner
people and then they like pushed it yeah
yeah so like people people love messing
with this kind of stuff yeah I'll just
upload pictures of me holding Doritos
bag and like oh yeah by my crotch yeah
that won't affect you though because
remember Facebook identifies it with
algorithmically and then hands it to and
so people are gonna see it so you can't
just roll like that unless it's a brand
that likes that if it's like a weird ran
like a deer and or something and I'm
wearing only deer and they might
actually like that bread would be like
yeah you're hilarious into whether or
not remember a few years ago this is
actually a few years ago like back when
I was in university maybe almost a
decade ago there was a stuff going
around that was like did you know that
you don't own your photos yes book
Facebook owns your photos yeah so I
looked into it and at least some this I
believe this is sourced to here an
article from 2017 said you know you in
fact do own your photos you own them and
if you take them away Facebook can't use
them anymore but they can use the mother
on the platform right correct when
they're on the platform Facebook has
total license to do stuff with them
including sub-licensing them to say
Pepsi Cola or whatever so start deleting
the ones you don't all the times you
were photographed holding Doritos or
something just delete them if you don't
want this to happen yeah yeah or just
stop really using Facebook delete
Facebook nice heck yeah it's useful in
other ways basically the only reason why
I have it is getting in contact with
people that are sometimes very hard to
get in contact with those phone books
aren't like really a thing anymore
yeah Facebook's the Yellow Pages yep
it's really good for those weak ties
yeah I don't have you're never really
friends I've met you you're useful now
yeah I want to get in touch here's a
message I'm speaking of are we at
halftime
should we are we you we are pretty much
we can do the thing I don't know what
I'm leaning back to do square face let's
do that
I'll also lean back partway through I
was just like where am I going I'd have
no idea
Squarespace gives you the tools you need
to build and grow your online presence
so you could make a really cool website
with all your information on it instead
of a Facebook page they've got tons of
templates Fanning a large variety of
categories do you need a website or a
blog how about your wedding or a
business Squarespace has you covered
there actually I know quite a few
couples that have spun up Squarespace
websites yes for the wedding
superfast yeah easy get started with a
free 14-day trial and head to
squarespace.com /when to get 10% off
your first purchase you can see it down
down here you get a domain quickly
through Squarespace if you need one or
port over an existing domain that you
already own and I believe this isn't in
the notes right here but I do believe
you sign up for a year that domain gets
thrown in yeah you usually get a free
one yeah I experienced with them yeah
yeah I think you have a sign up for a
year because buying domain generally
lasts for a minimum of a year at a time
so that makes sense but yeah moving
onwards we have disparate display
display right here this one guess what
this plate is a magnet mounted metal
print pull it over there we'll see you
later good bye and then you could be
like no Vancouver is upside down well
the upside down what do you think about
that it's abstract or utilities need to
bludgeon they're durable as you probably
just saw you don't need any power tools
to hang it with clearly which is cool
there's over 260,000 different arts
spanning a bunch of different styles and
influences with their easy metal with
their easy magnet mounting there are no
holes in the wall and it's replaceable
I'm really trying to serve the OCD
people out there that's gonna bother
bowling yeah yeah probably me speaking
of that though if you were going to in
get originally like that unlike a lot of
things you can just turn it back I'm
gonna try to also do a good job good
luck pal but like you can
can make sure it's correct after the
fact which is pretty cool they also
plant ten trees for each display
purchased whoa that's a lot of trees per
display that's quite a few trees whoa
yeah didn't know that one head to our
link below and use offer go to LTT to
save 15% today there you go offer code
15 bad plant 10 trees and buy thing for
your wall and save 15% while doing it
heck yeah and PR we got a new domain
thing which is cool LM GD g / p i a wham
instead of the crazy long things go on
the LI pyaar wan that sounds like an
island in the Philippines that'd be cool
it was private Internet access supports
a variety of VPN protocols and types of
encryption and authentication allowing
you to dial in the exact level of
privacy protection you need which is
cool but it has apps for Windows Mac OS
Android iOS it still says Linus
but Linux Google Chrome and support for
several other platforms coming soon you
connect up to five devices at the same
time apps include DNS leak protection
and ipv6 leak protection this one is my
favorite part actually the internet kill
switch will block all traffic if the VPN
becomes disconnected unexpectedly so you
don't have to worry about a security
hole if if like if something happens
with PIAA or something happens between
you and PA so your connection to them is
faulty for a second no data will go
through some of B no data that is
unencrypted which is pretty neato check
it out today at LMG comm /p ia Wang or
Pia wand PL Wan Jia Wan yeah
the emphasis matters whether you're
talking with the the island or the
people that live there this is a very
niche Philippines joke here Amazon
speaking of not niche I don't know
Amazon workers are listening in on Echo
audio report says oh people are mad and
I don't know why GG heck yeah
get out here Jamie you should have a
better domain we're past that stage
we're talking about Amazon now yeah
apparently it's LG chichi and I said
calm sorry about that
see my website is cool in Hazzard calm
the falkland are calm cool subscribe
heck yeah anyways Amazon workers are
listening to what you tell Alexa what
did you say you're wondering why people
are mad yeah well let's talk about it
yeah
bloomberg reports okay first of all
Bloomberg lately I think they've eroded
their trust
everybody's been way more off the board
the Bloomberg in my opinion Forbes oh I
don't know I'm just read stuff I'm not
talking about weird topics I'm talking
about trust because it started with that
report they made about the sorry Forbes
said the Chinese like microchip yeah a
lot weird a lot of people were like I
don't know doesn't sound credible and
then from there oh they had a recent one
and now this anyway no incredible they
just do weird stuff now the bloomberg
reports amazon tasks outside contractors
as well as full-time Amazon and
employees to comb through snippets of
audio from echo devices to help train a
le XA the company's voice enabled
assistant the clips include both
explicit commands and background
conversations presumably background
conversations that are caught happening
you say the hot word probably kind of
whatever whenever yeah what why not what
do you mean why not there's there's
nothing that stops them from doing it
whatever well it's not supposed to
connect to the servers and tell you say
the hot word sure I'm sure they could do
it absolutely whatever and they're
trying to train it to be better right so
they could be trying to train it to pick
up the thing is I don't think they have
to
I don't think okay hey I hear you're
saying they're like what if someone says
the hot word but then they want to hear
ten seconds before that to see if it
took that person twenty tries and then
they can learn okay you're Scottish and
this is how you say it
or if someone who is trying to say it
and failed and guess what I'm saying and
then just little tinfoil hat yeah I
think they don't I don't know I think
they could there's so many commands
every day
but you could go with false matches that
are fairly high percentage yeah like I
think you might have tried but it wasn't
good enough for them to actually
activate they could still listen to
those periods of time but how they
wouldn't be able to identify those
because it's only gonna connect the
service that only record when you
actually did make a match is that a harm
is that true are you sure it only
records when you fully make a match yeah
like if you say like hi Boogle then it's
it's it's like nope like I have my
Google home set to go drink after I say
it yeah and there are times where I'm
watching a movie and someone just says
something totally um they'll say like
yes please but they say no way that
sounds like the hot word and it'll be
dink when I'm just watching a movie I
know I probably not right now someone
hits like hi Boogle I know probably not
right now but for quite a while there
the biggest concern was it not detecting
when people were trying mm-hmm so I
would expect them to try to find the
ways that people were towards the audio
but it doesn't do a command yeah it
could happen like I'm not saying they're
gonna I'm not they record every single
word and he whatever says anywhere near
them and they might but I kind of don't
but from an engineer perspective it's
like a lot of these are the weak points
yeah and you would want to learn how to
improve that yeah so I could definitely
see them passing through recorded audio
and being like what was this was this
supposed to be an accurate match was did
our system rate it may be a little too
highly mm-hmm was it someone on a TV
show saying something completely
unrelated another related issue to that
was I mean we haven't really even
explained the whole story yet you get it
though there's they want to train this
machine to do a better job and surprise
they're using humans to do that you
thought maybe they were just putting
more computers on it but obviously
humans are really good at speaking so if
you want to train this thing to speak
better you just take the snippets that
are you're giving the Machine and let
humans annotate to tell the Machine how
to do it better it's pretty obvious
they're using humans but I guess no one
has I never explicitly said they were
doing that on their website it says that
user requests are applied to train our
speech recognition and natural language
understanding systems
it doesn't say with humans but it also
doesn't not say that so I think if you
think about it for a bit you would
assume that there you know yeah no I'm
not surprised at all I and I always
thought they work I do and it's not just
Amazon they're all doing this yeah Apple
does this Google does I'm very surprised
this was news because how else use yeah
of course that's yeah it's pretty weird
I I think one thing that does concern me
is like do they sell this data because
there's so the super unrelated and this
might I don't really use these devices
too often so I don't know but I have one
but I just it's right by my computer so
I usually just end up using a browser
anyways I don't know whatever but like
do outside apps have listen I guess but
like read access to these files
effectively I don't like could an app
that ties in to your echo get read
access to your voice to try to figure
out its side of things better I don't
think so probably not no I don't think
so I think it but like that so my
reference for the this is very shot in
the dark thing yeah I totally I'm not
surprised you say I don't think so but
my reference for that is Gmail thing
that happened forever ago were
personally reading those emails and
there was apparently accounts of people
like finding funny videos and emails and
sharing it to each other for laughs and
stuff so first of all it would be this
is pretty unrelated this would be text
right because it's gonna go right and be
transcribed as text and then you they
wouldn't even get the raw text I
wouldn't think because I would think
they wouldn't get that raw text because
Google would have to say Oh
undetermined oh this text is relevant to
that third party and then hand that
command over so they probably do get the
text but I don't think we almost
certainly don't get I don't think they
even get the raw text I think they get
the determination of what that text was
because and there are some commands you
have to issue on random TVs I've seen
this where you have to be high Boogle
ask
third party to do this like hi Google
asked LG to turn off the lights okay and
then that's this like maybe in that case
cuz you're explicitly saying ask LG then
LG would get the full thing I don't know
no I'm not sure how these interactions
work well one point I wanted to make was
you would think intuitively that when
they're listening to these these voice
clips that there would be a random
sample a big swath from all the users
but maybe it's not maybe there's some
users out there listening to more like
maybe maybe if you have a Scottish
accent or an accident that has
conventionally been very difficult for
the you're like oh that guy's great
we're gonna train on that guy I mean
there's overfitting problems and machine
learning if you if you only use a few
examples like that but they it might be
a subset of the population that's
getting listening to more often yeah
good aspect it would be if you have like
a super generic voice for an area that
has a very high population it's less
likely that I guess yours would be used
for sampling super often yeah or if
you're if they're trying to break into a
new market and there are they you know
that they suck at that market the
forefront of technology in that area
like well we only have ten people from
Glasgow we're gonna use all of them yeah
a lot yeah but there's some other
interesting things in this story the big
question everyone's mind right now is
probably like hey when they're listening
this voice clip of me do they know it's
me in the case of Amazon it appears that
they know your first name
and like out there's a product serial
number or something but they don't have
your last name or other any other
identifying things in the case of Apple
I think they have less than that they
don't have your first name and they have
a randomly generated number to us
associate to your account so it's pretty
safe that's said the clip can contain
sensitive information I'm talking about
my friends full name I could be talking
about my bank stuff I could say my I
looked into my own this was years ago
it's probably better at detection now
but I looked into my own like hey Google
information that probably worked
actually I say it's what you say hi
that's why I said hi anyway my bad but I
looked into like all the different audio
snip recording things the amount of
times that I was in the car and just
like an audiobook or the radio was on
we're definitely no one said that and it
has a recording of that is sing well the
amount of recordings there are of me not
trying to interact with it is wild Wow
like many hundred well you know how do
you know for sure that definitely no one
said that because I believe that after
the hot word then there's a delay and
then the recording so the audio so I
would be silent in the car but the audio
book could have said it like a second
before they're like Star Wars audiobooks
generally you would be surprised that
like I said mine's beside my couch and I
can hear it when it gets activated and
you'd be surprised sometimes what
activates it I'd be like I'm sure
there's a sound that sounded something
like whatever mm-hmm maybe some alien
has a weird name in Star Wars but like
the amount of times what all I was
saying is unintentional stuff that ends
up in there yeah and you're saying like
personal information obviously Star Wars
doesn't count for that but there was a
lot of other recordings as well
where is just like a random I can barely
even remember the conversation but it's
clearly a random conversation between me
and a friend and we're clearly not
trying to interact I see a lot of what
happens to me is I'll have people over
like a dinner party or something
I'll interact with it to change the song
and then I know I can just kind of turn
away and keep talking and I know that
the Machine will will know that what I'm
talking about now isn't relevant so even
though it wasn't even though the light's
still blinking it'll be like yeah and I
can just keep having my conversation but
that's gonna be recorded yeah just give
me an extra eight seconds of me talking
about tacos yeah I don't know this is
the kind of stuff we're like a lot of a
lot of modern technologies in various
ways you give up certain privacy's or
securities to have those technologies
and this is one of them if you want to
have a smart speaker in your home just
understand this stuff and move forward
you you're carrying about your security
is very important it's probably fine
though assault they were told
eventually that Amazon it was not
Amazon's responsibility to take action
so you know they go to their manager you
guys someone at the company has the
means to find out who this is like
should we tell the authorities and say
you know like someone got beaten up here
like they should get a record or
something like that what are the big
problems with this is
just like a roleplay BDSM etc etc etc
we're like it could be totally
aboveboard mm-hmm and now there's the
police knocking on your door because you
have AI helper robot thing yeah and you
never authorized maybe it's a movie yeah
totally appreciate the idea of reducing
those types of things but the Minority
Report also freaks me the hell out
mm-hmm and there's a lot of stuff that
could make someone think that that are
okay yeah yeah yeah it's not it is not
their responsibility that distri with
Amazon's can be used as evidence but I
think that's whether you think that's
okay or not that is definitely a totally
different thing they're not being
proactive they're reacting to law
enforcement like it's whether you think
it's okay or not I think they're in
totally different oh yeah
super chats super chats let's go they're
like normal chats but super bunch of
people sending $1.00 with no text I
appreciate it very nice appreciate you
um someone's asking you about some lag
on flow plane I think we know what's
going on there but it seems like it did
go pretty well today every week it's
improving a little bit I like the
pictures you guys have on the wall cool
go to full plate and bye Luke a better
office heck yeah I like my office right
now but we do have to move because LG's
expanding so darn fast guys gonna move
eventually cuz he is gonna be out of
space yeah like actually good god yeah
the rate at which LG is hiring is just
wild and floatplane tiring too and I'm
trying to bring people in locally like
there's there's one will is moving here
very soon oh one of the new hires that
we have is a Canadian he'll be moving
here locally so like within the next six
months we'll probably have two more
people locally yeah and there's other
people moving in locally that's all it
takes
honestly that like we're already
oversized at that point if between the
two companies there are six more people
it'd be over done yeah and that's gonna
happen really soon yeah so like I'm
active
looking for other places it's gonna be
really weird but oh well are you still
gonna come over for Friday wins at these
sweet a few guys are just in this
complex or something they'll be pretty
so I wanted that too but realistically
these are all things I'm suited for that
really yeah we just need an office space
yeah so it's like probably go downtown
be one of those like exposed brick posh
concrete super expensive yeah your
startup though baby get that investor
cash there's a yeah just reading about
people in our space don't even
necessarily competitors but in our space
that are like oh yeah they've got like
twenty to forty million dollars in VC
fund I'm like oh oh geez
yeah people talking about the audio
apparently the focus was screwed up like
the whole show the focus is for like the
back of our chairs so when when you and
I are leaning forward we're like super
oh so that sucks do they know he was
away and then his plane came in late I
believe oh I didn't know that I don't
think he was planning to come ever
though probably not I was like he was in
England yeah so his time shift is gonna
be smaller yeah I dare you guys to eat
the Carolina Reaper savage jerky I don't
think they're response to this week so
you don't have any here but we've done
it before on my very first one I did
that oh damn
Alexa in Google home do save recordings
where nothing happens I just researched
this and tested for a class project
send us your paper bro yeah let me just
do it up email me your thesis Luke from
one broadcast dye your hair green oh I
think greens obvious hair color and love
from actually depends on the green I
think it can be definitely it can be
yeah anyways that's it for super chats
I believe we're wait are we done no we
have one more topic yeah there's one
more oh I see what people are talking
about sorry about that
there you go what is the one more
Walmart adding more robots Walmart
already employs many robots they're
getting lots more they have announced
they will deploy 1500
new Auto C autonomous floor cleaners you
know like those floor clean of things
that people ride on like me and that
kind of like little Zamboni's I think
they don't need those anymore
mmm but 1500 how many swall marks
locations are there if it's not very
many in them in the grand scheme of
Walmart like here okay well mites are
large though I'm gonna make a guess how
many Walmart locations are this 50
states they're in multiple countries I'm
gonna say 3,000 4,700 that's actually I
guess it's more than you thought I was
guessing around 6 K so I do you think
that they're gonna get one floor cleaner
per store like even in their test the
subset of stores that are testing this
do you think they're getting more than
yeah I know I think they just get one
just one okay because if it's automated
it can cruise around and do whatever all
night yeah yeah yeah so Walmart is
getting 1500 Auto C autonomous for Fears
they're getting only 300 Auto s shelf
scanners what does that thing do
probably just check inventory how I'm
picturing like those like surveillance
drones and Star Wars that are like those
balls all the antennas like just
hovering down the aisles just gonna ride
along the ledge of the shelf you think
it's I don't know I don't know I'm
really not sure they're getting an
additional 1200 fast unloaders to scan
and sort items as they come off delivery
trucks this one's interesting plus to
streamline online orders it will have
900 pickup towers so customers can order
something on the company's site and pick
it up from a vending machine at the
nearest Walmart pick oh that's less
interesting though I thought because
like building towers across the country
I just like this is getting very pretty
it's just a it's just yeah and it's at a
Walmart locations where there's anything
not that interesting and just buy from
the store yeah the idea is that by
pushing menial tasks to the robots
Walmart's human employees can spend more
time helping customers in preparing
online orders for pickup that is sweet
bullcrap yes let us fire them
they'll replace them eventually yeah but
it is my job while they're unsure in the
meantime it's like hey you don't have to
do this anymore so you can just help
people which is cool
we got a few years of awesome and then a
lot less people have jobs it sucks when
you're walking around a store and you're
like who works here and then you see
someone works there and they're doing
something and you're like hey can i bug
you and they're like I guess one thing
I've always wanted especially at Home
Depot is like and home people has an app
and that I believe it's supposed to do
this but last time I tried it it sucked
but maybe it's gotten better because
I've been trying forever but I want to
be able to be on my phone in the store
and just like where the heck is this
thing and have it tell me turn left
because that's pretty much the only
reason why I ever need your employees
yeah for sure where the heck is this
like the last thing I needed was like a
shelf peg it's like weird where would
that be
mmm a shelf peg yeah like and then like
like the little like clear plastic
little l-shaped thing that you put in
the hole on the shelf to hold the
individual like a bracket like like that
you put shut it no no no but they're
like super tiny Oh like this big it has
a little metal nub it and there's a hole
drill that you know love it love it
I don't know what to call it okay I
wouldn't know where to buy that either
dude right hates hardware and Canadian
Tire has it aisle and she'll fix that's
cool that's sweet but like do you have
to install an app and so I just said
there's nobody equities would even noob
its world's best stable digital
currencies nub it to bees baby and you
be vit
what does another dude Urban Dictionary
nub it oh geez
it's a word now yeah someone make a new
entry yeah there we go
an of it make it not the one that's on
there it's like a nubbin no just their
site okay that's cool be able to use
apparently Canadian Tire website to look
for an item I'll let you know where it
is
oh they're like but how do they let you
know they say oh thanks I owe an IO and
shelf that's pretty good
yeah can I just say I would like to have
a beep I'd like to have a warmer colder
is an alien
yeah they're really close to us I think
so I think that's our original alien
stuff yeah I don't think that's predator
so yeah I think so
but I like one thing that I think is
pretty important too though is that it
needs to be able to be pretty good at
guessing what the heck you're talking
about
yeah because especially in a place like
like Home Depot or Lowe's or whatever
where it's like Hardware you matter
people are gonna go in there and be like
I need a screw it's like what screw it's
like it uh this one I don't know that it
would be cool if you can take a picture
or something like well you bought is
even remotely close to what you search
they'd be like what do you meant by Nava
to learn what the heck knowbut is over
time shelf no that's heck yeah I I I
called them it's the reason why I'm like
particularly triggered about this shelf
peg thing is because I it took me I
think four or five employees to find it
oh yeah
because I'd asked one and they'd send me
somewhere to get in there and be like
this is planks of wood this is not
plastic things with little metal things
coming out of them they just they didn't
accompany you they just sent you in see
you later
but like honestly they're so freaking
busy each one of them were helping like
three or four people they can move I
think they need more a they need more
auto cease and auto asses yeah to help
them
come on Home Depot figure it out but
yeah you're right eventually it'll just
be no one working the check out it'll be
guest service and a couple people
walking around and that's it yeah it's
just an AI it just blows around how are
you doing today hmm and if they have to
you can do live chat you just get
someone up on the screen yeah all right
what do you need how did you get
elevated to this the Nuggets are over
there right why did you press zero five
times come on give me a break it's a
Friday
yeah I don't know I kind of its it I
don't know if I'm naive or just a
butthole but I kind of welcome the if
you a severe endure okay automated
checkout really that's not the direction
I thought you're going yeah like I've
been doing McDonald's once in Australia
and these we use the self menu thing
save someone's job and go up there
and I was like nope I would like to send
the signal that I prefer this I don't
think anyone should work at the front of
this I don't I don't know I think maybe
because how do you want to solve I'm a
techno optimist yeah yeah because I
believe that in the eventual future
where no one's working they're the
people that are working are getting paid
a lot and the people aren't working are
on a beach playing guitar I love this
idea but how do you like fun to those
people corporate taxes corporate taxes
okay I don't have all the answers man
I'm not like know you've all hurry or
whatever but I think whirring one of my
problems there is like you would need
this is going super off-topic and the
show is almost over so we can cut it
pretty quick but like how aggressive are
your allowances for small business then
because there's a lot of industries like
the one flow plane is trying to get into
now that to penetrate properly you're
going to have to get relatively large
yeah like if we had super aggressive
corporate taxes of the people that would
be working at McDonald's and they don't
actually need to do that job because
that should be automated relatively
quickly because we're wasting human
potential can go sit on a beach or make
art or whatever if our corporate taxes
have to pay for that we're screwed
when we have to go up against these
giant companies sure there's other
proposals someone had a proposal about
making robots pay income tax
I think the Economist magazine was like
that's a bad idea I read that article I
don't know why it's a bad idea but I'm
not saying that the tools we have now
are going to be sufficient in that world
I think I I am very strongly in
agreeance that like we're way off topic
here but like the just the the mass
waste of human potential is amazing just
what the lengths people will go to and
and the fact that like someone can be
very good at something but modern hiring
processes have not really gotten much
better in like a really long time so you
have to even if you're in X
extremely skilled person at something
you probably have to go through the
Walmart or McDonald's or whatever grind
so that you can like eventually land a
job somewhere get like the placement of
very skilled people is not very good
yeah specially if you're an immigrant I
have a doctor I'm driving a taxi I like
it and it's taxis that should probably
be automated why we're so close to that
being done the whole transportation
