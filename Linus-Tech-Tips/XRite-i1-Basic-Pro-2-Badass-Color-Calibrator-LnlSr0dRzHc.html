evaluating the performance of the item
about which we made the video but not
today no today will be different the
subject of today's video is one for
which we are not capable of measuring
the performance for it is itself a
measuring instrument I didn't imagine
this could one evaluate the performance
of a tape measure
perhaps by comparing the feet to one's
own feet or the inches to one's own pit
Intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check out the link in
the video description to learn more okay
so the intro was pretty silly today but
I don't want that to take away from the
seriousness of the tool that I've got in
front of me ok no seriously I'm done
with that this my friends is the
cryptically named xr8 I won basic Pro to
an instrument that even with the best
press discount we could negotiate cost
us 800 US dollars to buy excuse me Linus
what makes that goofy-looking hunk of
plastic worth over a thousand Canadian
pesos great question the I one basic pro
2 is a professional-grade color
measurement and calibration device in
this case a spectrophotometer with the
ability to accurately I mean assuming
you adhere to the yearly recertification
process measure not only the light
output of pretty much any display you
would actually want to use but also of
projectors and even printers to maintain
an accurate workflow from the initial
graphic design to display on the web and
finally to physical paper media this is
necessary because while the human eye
magnificent beast that it is can detect
a given range of wavelengths of light
that's what we perceive as color our
devices be they monitors televisions or
printers cannot achieve
the same level of performance yet with
printers in particular leggings
significantly behind their digital
counterparts so accurate color
calibration and careful profile creation
for the various devices and artists
would use is essential for preventing
that chick modeling the hottest parkas
for this season or whatever from looking
oversaturated when viewed on a monitor
and under saturated when viewed on the
pages of a magazine and this is even
more important when collaborating
remotely with someone else say for
example if you were designing a land
hoody where standardized Pantone colors
mean nothing if everyone's equipment is
not calibrated correctly okay got it
Linus color is cool and sciency and all
that crap but come on we've seen your
work and you guys are all over the map
when it comes to color in your video so
what do you need it for okay one that is
something we're working on thanks to LG
and X right all of our workstations are
equipped with I one pro color imagers
and thirty-one mu 97 4k video editing
monitors so you should expect to see
some improvement soon and to this device
is actually not for the video editors
here at Linus Media Group it is for me
now you might have seen some fancy pants
looking graphs in the last couple of
monitor videos that I've done those were
created by spectra Cal's Cal 9 5 for
business software an incredibly robust
tool of which I've only barely begun to
scratch the surface people use this
software for all kinds of stuff like
making sure that our wall of discreet
displays doesn't have that goofy effect
where they all look a little different
which is jarring when an object passes
over the border between them two home
theater installations two professional
studio use but I'm focused on using
their evaluation tools to determine the
performance with respect to color
accuracy maximum luminance etc of
computer monitors so it works a little
something like this I fire up a monitor
that I need to evaluate and I look for
the profiles in the displays menu that
are most likely to be accurate so the
movie profile usually isn't the right
one
since that tends to crush blacks like
there's no tomorrow so you lose detail
in dark parts of the scene usually if
you want the accurate one it's going to
be srgb or RGB depending on how wide a
gamut your monitor can cover so then I
run through the gauntlet of tests and
this basically tells me if the display
manufacturer is actually calibrating
before they put the monitor into the box
or just applying a general profile and
hoping for the best from unit to unit
after they ship once that's done
although this has become less necessary
in recent times with IPS monitors
becoming so affordable and even and even
high-performance with 144 Hertz displays
like Aces xB 270 hu available
I use the I one basic Pro tune to apply
an ICC profile to the monitor
effectively correcting whatever mistakes
the panel is making natively with your
computer's graphics card and measure
again to get a best case after
calibration look at the displays
capabilities so that's pretty much it
there's not much to say other than
thanks to X right for the discount and
two spectra Cal for the software license
and the marathon three-hour training
session on the phone so that we can do
much more now than just say you know
yeah the colors on this one look pretty
you know fleam you know and just make
things up as we go along both now and
into the future
guess who's back it's zero makers of
useful and often adorable mobile
accessories so they've got a couple of
new ones here today the first one is the
plate cable which is usually 15 bucks
but they actually got a special 450
units over in Amazon for twelve and
pretty much what it does is it takes
what would normally be a cable and folds
it up around a little thing that fits on
your keychain it's available in either
Lightning or micro USB connectors and
then folds back up when you do not need
it any longer so you can always carry a
cable around with you at all freakin
times the other one is a variant on one
that we've actually shown you guys
for there two and one cable so the
previous one had they're like cute
little danboard thing on it with the
light-up eyes and all that well this is
a lower-cost alternative it's 15 bucks
normally but same as the other one for
the first 50 units it's 12 dollars so
we'll have links to both of those in the
video description and thanks to cheerio
