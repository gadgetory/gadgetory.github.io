the zotac Meg mini all-in-one giant okay
so that is literally what it's called
the mini all-in-one giant and a gene Meg
okay so first of all this is an ion
based Adam based PC so you can see Adam
I on GeForce CUDA and purevideo HD so
the ion chipset allows this small tiny
PC much like the Acer Revo to process
1080p full-hd video
they're saying it's extremely science
silent includes an LCD mount has a 160
gig hard drive 2 gigs of memory and an
energy-saving Atom CPU now one thing
that this has going for it versus
something like an aspiring OH is that it
does not include an OS because not
everyone actually needs a copy of an OS
when they buy a new PC so if you buy one
of these you can use your existing
operating system in order to just
install it and go ok so here we go this
is the you know we can talk about this
once we open it up I see no reason to do
it now here let's have a look at the
specs there we go what's inside one
ZOTAC mag 1 stent one VESA mount for
mount screws an AC adapter a power cord
a support CD a warranty card and a user
manual and there's the full specs so
we've got the atom 330 dual core Nvidia
ion graphics processor 2 gigs ram
Gigabit LAN okay we've got n Wireless an
SD and SDHC card reader onboard 8
channel digital audio and then we have
VGA HDMI spit if mic headphone six USB
ports that's a lot of USB ports for one
of these that's pretty good
gigabit and then II SATA so let's get
this open up and have a look at the mini
all-in-one giant that's actually a
pretty nice box I really like ZOTAC
scullers school just like them matte
black and glossy orange I don't can
explain why it sounds tasteless but I
think it looks great
so what's this say it's time to play
actually in my in my tech tips episode
about the Revo I actually did a demo
where I'm playing counter-strike source
on the on the ion chipset and it handles
it ok so maybe you can play maybe it is
time to play ok warranty terms so it has
a one-year warranty
okay and then you there's your driver
installation CD along with the zotac
case patch then you've got your user's
manual as well as a Quick Start Guide
which is available in wow check out all
these languages look at that that is a
lot of languages good jobs attack who
can really tell that they're looking to
sell this internationally like with a
capital idea
alright in here we will find for mount
screws and then one stand okay so we can
sit the mag on top of that when we are
using it on this side we found find one
power cord and then one AC adapter makes
the adapters a little bit on the big
side but it's not exactly a netbook so
you're not going to be moving around
there Finnegan worry too much about that
and then more piece of cardboard packed
in here pretty pretty darn well I
actually I'm quite happy to see that
it's not gonna be damaged during
shipping and it's not gonna have the
finish damaged either I really like this
particular phone okay so let me see if I
can figure out how this works
oh okay so it comes sort of sitting on
top of the vase amount so I'm gonna have
to slide it out okay so that is how it
attaches it actually slides right into
that and then yeah there we go I got it
off ok so that attaches to the back of
your monitor or your TV and then you
slide the mag down into it that's pretty
clever actually I like it and then here
we are we've got the zotac meg itself so
this thing is really light really small
and let's have a look at what we've got
included in terms of functionality so
here is your power switch there is what
appears to be a hard drive LED then
there's your wireless activity LED one
front USB the front SD and SDHC card
reader then you've got a microphone and
a headphone
on the front and we move around to the
back and here we have eSATA a couple USB
one gigabit ethernet two more USB oh I'm
lost I don't remember what that is VGA
HDMI and then optical audio out and then
there's your power in so it actually
sits on the stand has a very very well
very glossy finish on it can you see the
the finger shot there where you can yeah
okay awesome and it's got like a so tack
as otac sort of branding label on it
yeah I mean it's a fairly nondescript
looking unit to be perfectly honest on
the top there's one more USB which I had
missed before and then on the bottom
we've got just some air vents as well as
the little piece that slides onto the
stand so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the zotac Meg</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
