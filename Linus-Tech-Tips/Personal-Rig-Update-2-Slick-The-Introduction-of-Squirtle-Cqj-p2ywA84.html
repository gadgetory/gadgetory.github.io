DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts so after months
of protesting Linus has finally made me
to a personal rig update so as you can
kind of see before me there are the
remnants of the late mineral oil
computer it does not exist anymore if
you've seen my video hopefully somewhere
around here before of the mineral oil
computer you'll know where that came
from that computer was very dear to me
it helped me get a scholarship to get to
school it then helped me meet friends at
school once they'd see the computer they
talked to me and I was fun and it helped
me get this job amongst other things so
that computer was actually very dear to
me and it meant more than just being a
computer so it was really crappy to see
it go it went because a series of
unfortunate events with a previous
roommate who will remain nameless for
his sake and hopefully I don't find him
resulted in the bottom of the fish tank
cracking I then hand carried the fish
tank all the way home overbust transit
where one of the bus drivers thought it
was a bomb and didn't even really want
to let me on it first over a ferry and
then my dad picked me up in the other
side of the ferry and all the way home
and then my dad thank you Dad
helped me fix the computer by sealing
the bottom with automotive sealant and
that was great it held for quite a while
actually it held long enough that you
guys could see that video and that video
was filmed about a year and a half
afterwards and it took about another six
months to reach its final demise it
started leaking out of the bottom again
about five six months after that video
was filmed the video about the mineral
computer originally and I kind of knew
it was its time the sealant was giving
away it's really hard to find those fish
tanks Eclipse six there they're designed
in a way that it's really nice for
putting a computer in it all the enough
considering it's a fish tank the front
is bowed and the top has a big dome on
it so you can build in your cable
management and your hard drives and
whatnot up there so it is actually quite
nice and it is fairly
important that you had that case so I
couldn't find another one and that was
it I now just have these remnants
amongst pretty much everything else that
was in that computer the only part that
died coming over that computer was my
graphics card and that was due to
negligence of my own unfortunately I
didn't really think about the fact that
after being in there for like five years
the oil would kind of take away at the
thermal paste and I just put the
graphics card in a computer really
quickly after I had taken it out of the
mineral computer and ran it for a little
while hoping that it would work and
trying to fix it and I think I might
have burnt it out so got rid of that
everything else still works though this
power supply still works and the story
behind this is interesting you'll notice
it doesn't have the casing anymore
doesn't have the casing because when I
try to fit it in the mineral computer it
sat at the bottom and I couldn't get the
rocks out of under it so it would sit up
on these rocks and it was too high and
the top of the power supply was actually
pushing up against some RAM that I had
in the computer again if you look back
at that video you'll see the clearance
there and so I had to take the casing
off because once I took the casing off I
get the fan out and what's the fans out
it would fit it would be fine
so I unscrewed everything took it off
and then I hit this point on the bottom
where you can see there was a terrible
job of taking the metal apart I was
determined to get this thing built in
one day it took me like 12 or 13 hours
it was brutal and once I got to this
part I used a piece of metal which was
not designed for pulling metal apart and
brute strength to literally rip the
metal off so I wedged it in so I could
get a point of leverage and then
literally pulled the thing off you it's
terrible hopefully there will get some
close-ups of it but it worked I was
pissed I was like 10 11 hours into the
build and I had to make it work and I
made it work and it's fantastic and the
power spot still works somehow my
favorite thing about this power supply
is that around the time that this came
out this is a let me see here HX 620 W
modular power supply from Corsair when
this first came out everyone was
fighting tooth and nail for black PCB
motherboards that was like not a huge
thing at that point in time and
this has a black PCB in it that always
blew my mind it's a power supply like
almost no one other than me really got
to see that other than the modular part
that's super green but the actual base
PCB is black which is just fantastic
thank you for doing that
because I would totally see that
otherwise this is the radiator that was
in the mineral computer it still has oil
in it I still have a ziploc bag on the
back so the oil won't drip everywhere
because oil is incredibly hard to get
off things there's still oil on this
power supply actually if you touch
different parts of it there's still
definitely oil on it and the plant the
legendary plant that was inside the oil
computer and is like super dilapidated
now yeah I don't know I didn't want to
show off everything because I looked
like a super pack rat because I am
because I'm very nostalgic about all
this stuff and I can't really let it go
I used to have a bubble machine that was
inside of it but this was actually one
of the first big hurdles that I had to
jump over was this stupid bubble machine
because I had these black rubber suction
cups so you could push it on the inside
of the case because they expect you to
have a water-filled fish tank because
that makes sense jerks so I fill it up
with mineral oil and the mineral oil
rots away the rubber and the rubber just
starts going everywhere and particles go
all over the place and it was a disaster
I tried to I tried to pour it through
like a sieve kind of thing and it didn't
filter the rubber out at all it was
still really gross so I had to
eventually get rid of all that oil that
was expensive and I had to get new oil I
felt bad because my brother actually
bought a lot of the oil for me for the
first build because I was running out of
money and that was fantastic and then I
had to get more so that kind of sucked
so the demise of the mineral oil
computer brought to attention squirtle
this is the new computer this is the
current in limbo computer also known as
limbo actually because it changes so
much and because of how it's set up so
that it can change so much it's in an
800 D which was a hand-me-down from
Linus's wife's computer at the time she
has a much smaller easier to manage case
now this thing is a beast and weighs a
ton
luckily I can carry it around but it is
actually very annoying to carry around I
do bring this thing to lands and we do
learn fairly often so that can be kind
of frustrating to go through components
let's start with the power supply now
I'm going to preface this with with I
love this power supply this power supply
is fantastic
what I don't like about it is that it's
blue for one and two that it's very
poorly sleeved but other than that it's
absolutely fantastic circuitry is great
the features are awesome no issues with
it there but I recently tried to kind of
pull a fast one by swapping a
Silverstone cloth sleeved beautiful
power supply into my workstation at work
which totally doesn't need it so they
could kind of sit there and be forgotten
and then my eventual plan was to move it
into this computer and swap this one out
up there but ya know wine is co-active
that would pretty much immediately so
that's not happening going to have to
sleeve this guy so we'll see what I can
do about that next up is the SSD that's
in here everything has a story in this
case next up is the SSD that is an
octane 256 gigabyte SSD from back when I
was testing thunderbolt and USB 3 speeds
and all these weird SSD tests that I was
doing at the time and I had to do a lot
of those out sort of hours so Linus let
me have that for doing all the outside
of hours work that was fantastic
I was also never able to water cool
before this due to straight-up cost I
was always a student never able to
really afford water cooling so when
mineral oil computer finally went away
Linus supported me and getting water
cooling going as well which was
fantastic the gigantic rad up here is
from Linus the nice Swift tech water
block is from Linus I had a t-virus from
Linus but it was semi broke and so got
rid of that the defy Vario in the bottom
which is beautiful if you're going to
get a pump you should get that pump
that's from Linus as well and there's
something interesting about the bottom
you may be wondering why this is not
down there this is the removable plastic
thing that goes in Corsair 800 DS and
slides into the bottom right there not
down there
as with how it works I wouldn't really
be able to mount my pump to it very well
why would I want to mount my pump to it
well part of its because it's plastic so
it make a lot of noise and there's other
issues for mounting a pump to it because
I wanted the pump to be removable
everything in this case has to be able
to be very easily swapped and very
easily pulled out and messed with so it
wasn't really going to work great on
this so we took a mud flap from my old
crappy convertible which like barely
worked when it did work and it's in a
scrap heap somewhere now we took a mud
flap from it and my dad was able to
custom cut the mud flap so that it fits
on that sliding rail so you can actually
see the model of my car on there which
is which is kind of cool actually I like
that that's that's super ghetto but I
always have to have something that's
super ghetto in my computer
unfortunately right now pretty much
everything is super ghetto in this
computer but we'll get more into that
later next up is the motherboard area
components so I got this at 77 premium a
Seuss board by accidentally bricking my
Zed 77 deluxe a Seuss board while I was
working so luckily I was able to get
that swap out which is good but I don't
really use any of the additional few
features that the premium has over the
deluxe so wasn't a huge improvement
there although it works which is a
pretty huge improvement I'm still
running a 2600 K in here and I'm not
really that interested in upgrading to
be completely honest as of right now
this platform is great for me this 2600
K is crazy fast
I have profiles for it running 5
gigahertz plus I have profiles all the
way down just for different temperature
levels and voltage levels and all that
kind of stuff
I've it all perfectly set up exactly how
I need it to be and that's fine
there's been no processor that's really
wowed me lately so I'm completely ok
with the 2600 K and I fully expect
myself to be sitting on this platform
for a while other than that we've got a
graphics card which is 780 from gigabyte
the wind force Edition whatever but it
is a reference design card I have a
block coming so that I can start water
cooling and integrated into my loop you
can see the tubing goes right over top
of it so it'll be really easy
to integrate into my loop and then
that'll be great I also have a heat
killer back plate which I actually have
it's not here but I have a heat killer
back plate for it already which will
look fantastic I love those heat killer
back plates and as you can probably see
the water loop is absolutely putrid I
was hoping that these silver fittings
were going to be able to hold back the
gunk and that was not true at all so
somewhere around here I have a silver
kill coil but I don't remember exactly
where it is but that's going to be going
in there as well and I'm going to have
to probably ditch all my tubing and
clean out my rad and clean up my block
and clean up the pump and do all that
kind of stuff so I can redo the whole
loop which will not be fun
but it's disgusting right now so that
will have to happen the sound card down
at the bottom before the audio forum
starts murdering me for having a sound
card and not a no to it I got it for 25
bucks way back at an NCIS warehouse sale
which was awesome it's a zonar card the
main reason why I like it is because it
has the big quarter inch plugs which I
just I like that
I don't like 3.5 millimeter plugs
they're annoying I feel like they're
going to break all the time
I adapter all my 3.5 millimeter quarter
inch which I know really does nothing
but I just like it a lot and it was
worth the 25 bucks and I'm very happy I
have it eventually I'm sure I'll switch
to some other solution but for now it's
absolutely great now we get into what I
like to call my patent-pending
ez swap technology which is where I just
leave the cables for everything pre
plugged in and just dangling there
because it's easy to set things up that
way so you can see I have a hard drive
mounted just sitting in the optical
drive bay area and now se mounted is
actually pushing it kind of far because
this isn't screwed in in any way and it
just sits there and it's horrible super
not recommended totally not a good idea
at all but yep doing it because it's
super easy and it is a temporary hard
drive I'm not gonna be keeping that
forever
I've been data swapping stuff towards my
Nass for a little while now and I've
been trying to move things around if you
guys saw the Synology video recently you
don't know I got a Synology Nass and
I've been kind of changing my setup so
that is a temporary harddrive so I could
just move things to it and off
all the time as I reformat drives and
whatnot so it will be moving eventually
but the rest of these cables that are
just kind of dangling here are there so
I can slide in drives into the front of
the case and just plug them in really
easily because the backplane for this
thing broke years ago and doesn't work
at all so I have to manually plug
everything in that way so yeah they're
all just sitting there ready to go which
is horrible and disgusting aesthetically
but is very easy to work with another
thing you'll notice is down here this
fan is totally not screwed in at all
which was interesting while trying to
move the case because it started
flopping around and also that the door
that goes over that fan above it is also
not in at all despite having it right
here I find these rather annoying I
don't mind seeing the fan and having to
push this in and out all the time it
gets yeah like I just said annoying so I
just leave it out and the reason why
that fan is completely loose is I could
probably fix that because I have extra
screws up here in the top that could
work for it is the long black screws
that you often use to fit through the
top of your case through a set of fans
and then into a radiator when I was at
Al and another buddy didn't have enough
to be able to mount a new cooler that he
had brought with him and so I sacrificed
mine that were hooked into that fan so
like it can just sit in the bottom and
it's a gentle typhoon so it'll probably
just kind of be able to hold itself up
and it will probably be fine because I'm
managing it with a fan speed controller
in the back of my case and honestly it
has been fine before I moved this I kind
of forgot it was freely floating like
that so I'm going to have to steal some
screws from the top I think and screw
that bad boy and or hopefully I'll just
be able to get some other ones
eventually I'm gonna be swapping pretty
much all the fans out in this case
anyways for those new Noctua
industrial ones because they look humph
pacing and I'm super stoked to get those
so that will happen at some point in
time no time soon though if you're
wondering why the tubing from our water
cooling goes up into the right instead
of up into the left
this ties into that whole patent-pending
technology I was talking about not
really but yeah it makes it so that if I
take the block off it falls down
the right instead of kind of dangling
right in the way of everything if it
falls down to the right with gravity and
the tubes and everything that means that
accessing the motherboard becomes
extremely easy instead of very annoying
it doesn't look aesthetically pleasing
but it works really well and now we move
on to the dreaded and horrible back of
the case so continuing on with the
patent-pending easy swap technology no
it's I can't even keep that up for much
longer this is terrible
I get angry when I'm helping people
build their computers and if they decide
to do all the cable management before I
show up I unplug everything and redo it
I didn't do that
with my computer I like to think that
that comes from the idea that if I'm
building one for someone else or helping
them build it they're probably not going
to change anything for a long time and I
change things quite often with this
computer because I do but not really the
greatest excuse I could cable management
in some form this is the octane I was
telling you about early on it is secured
by nothing this is my t balancer which
is fantastic great fan controller it is
secured by electrical tape that's it not
screwed in no plate no bracket just
electrical tape this rubber grommet up
here is not able to fully go in due to
the mounting of my t virus so I secured
it with electrical tape good job there
you go
yeah and none of these cables are
actually held in by anything if they're
secured at all it is secured by other
cables actually this is the only place
that there's any form of cable
management and it's not holding it to
the case it's just it was tied that way
and it was absolutely tied this way by
someone else not by me so I can't even
take claim for that we're not going to
spend too much time back here because it
makes me sad so we're going to move on
so you guys know it's bad Linus notes
it's bad now pretty much I wouldn't lie
this media group knows it's bad most my
friends won't know it's bad until they
see this video because I kind of hide it
under my desk so you can only see it out
of the corner of your eye so it looks
good
good my mom will think it's fantastic no
matter what I love you mom and so what
am I going to do about it because it
sucks well I've been sitting hunting for
a case for an extremely long period of
time and I honestly can't find anything
that I truly really have fallen for I
really like Lions case to go7 but
they've kind of changed how they made
them so to be able to get one that's
absolutely fantastic
you need lionesses case one of the
original to do sevens which are great
there's the murder box mark one or
whatever it is which is great but
terrifically scary freakishly expensive
and I can't bring myself to buy it and
other than that I'm just not really sold
so I'm probably going to stick with good
old 800 d what am I going to do to it
first plan is to take this back panel
and cut a tree of Gondor into the back
panel huge fan all over there a nice by
the way and then line it with this stuff
which is be quiet PC noise absorber kit
if you open it up on the inside you find
one giant thick piece of super squishy
foam and then a bunch of these not as
thick not as squishy panels that you can
custom cut to whatever size you want I
got this not way too long ago and I plan
on using this all throughout the case to
be completely honest I want to use it
pretty much everywhere because that
paired up with the industrial knock duas
which I plan on getting should be
fantastic I'm making a very quiet
computer so I want to cut the tree of
Gondor then line the outside of the tree
of Gondor with that stuff try and get
white LEDs to point either directly at
the back panel or to point sideways not
out so that you can look right at it and
it's glowing but it's not going directly
at your eyes so it's not very hard to
look at I think that would look
fantastic I think it would look
absolutely great just the white lined
LEDs I think that would look really good
and that's it for the back now for the
inside so the back was the tree of
Gondor the inside I'm thinking I'm less
sure about this but I'm thinking more of
a more Dorothy
so we're placing all the tubing which
already needs to happen with red red
tubing we're placing the liquid with
probably Mayhem's red I'm probably have
to replace this t-virus but I might just
get another t-virus because I love these
things I'm not entirely sure but I might
do something with the RAM I'm gonna try
and paint the heatsinks on the
motherboard red I'm going to try and get
a really cool design done to the heat
killer plate that I'll be putting on the
back of the 780 I'm gonna try to do
something with the box of this power
supply but I'm not entirely sure what
I'm not too worried about it because it
does get hidden when the doors on
there's no way I'm removing my Sunfire
mudflap so that's staying there sunbird
or whatever um cleaning up cables I have
to receive the power supply for sure I
have to change lengths of the cables
because I'm going to be doing that tree
of Gondor thing on the back I'm gonna
have to kill manage around things so I'm
gonna have to make my own cable so the
power supply that'll suck but whatever
replacing all the fans with Noctua
industrial fans I'm probably leave the
rat up there it's a huge rad and I like
it works really well and yeah that's
probably about it not entirely sold on
that plan we'll see maybe I'll go The
Hobbit theme but I don't know how to do
that or something I'll figure it out
elven I don't know how to do that either
I don't like gold so meaning hope you
look really weird I don't know I'll
figure it out as for the back I want to
steal something from NZXT and put a LED
up in the back so I can see my eye oh
really easily I think that would be
fantastic and that shouldn't be too hard
to do either so I plan on doing that and
then that's honestly about it I have no
plan on changing the platform because
again no processors really wowed me I
don't see myself changing the case
because no case has really wowed me
enough to want to actually switch to it
from this case yeah I guess I need to
try to fix this backplane here so I can
actually put hard drives there again
because putting hard drives down here in
the bottom which is another hard drive
cage is terrible
it's it's not good at all so I'm gonna
have to try and fix that in some form or
just move to straight SSDs which might
be a plan as well because I can just
shove them in the back hopefully better
than that that's another thing need to
fix the cable management but I think I
already brought that up
and then that's about it sorry to
everyone that expected something awesome
if you're wondering why if you've
watched some of the after parties why
I'm really vague when I answer what my
current computer is is because I kind of
hide it because I'm not really happy
with what state it's in right now it's
hard to go from mineral oil awesomeness
to poor old squirtle here who is awesome
but just doesn't get enough credit
because I don't treat him well enough
I'm sorry squirtle I'm so sorry
anyways thank you guys for watching
comment and rip me apart in the comments
section below rip me apart on the forum
while you're down ripping me apart in
the comments section below this like or
dislike this video don't forget to
subscribe for hopefully an update at
some point in time which isn't as
terrible as this while you're over on
the forum if you don't want to see the
ads be sure to become a contributor
because that way you get rid of all the
ads on the forum which is fantastic and
if you want a shirt which is not this
one be sure to check out the link into
the trip ssin for shirts because
hopefully we'll have some interesting
stuff I know there's a few things coming
out that I've been waiting for for a
long time that we haven't released in
terms of shirts so hopefully that
happens soon thank you guys for watching
thank you guys for bearing through the
terribleness of the current state of my
computer and I will see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
