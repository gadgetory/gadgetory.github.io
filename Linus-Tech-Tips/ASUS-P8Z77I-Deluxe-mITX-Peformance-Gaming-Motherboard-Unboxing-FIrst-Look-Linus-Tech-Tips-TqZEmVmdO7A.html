a very exciting motherboard so good
things do yes this is a motherboard look
at this it's like the size of my head
this is the p8z 77 i deluxe from asus
this is part of their minimax series of
other boards forget about a home
entertainment center forget about
minimax think gaming with this
motherboard this is an ITX board that
has just you know what who cares about
all of this stuff let's open it up and
check this out because it's awesome okay
so first we have the motherboard but I'm
gonna make you guys wait for that wait
for the exciting part first I'm gonna
make you sit through the accessories
which are actually pretty good for an IT
export as you may or may not have
noticed already mounting screws dual
band Wi-Fi two Wi-Fi antennas at least I
hope that school band Wi-Fi I haven't
screwed myself over here yeah oh and
Bluetooth 4.0 was also included with
this board for SATA cables to red to
black that's an odd choice seriously a
speech partner for something something I
will have to find out what that is I
never see not support IO shield okay
manual with CD they should use and let's
have a look at the motherboard itself
look at this you couldn't even find a
bag that's the right size for a
performance motherboard this small way
to awesome
oh yeah here alright come on take a
closer look at this okay so we're gonna
start with this angle because this is
like before it gets way too baller so
you have an 1155 socket which means you
have full support for anything up to a
3770k
yes you can overclock on this board yes
it is awesome okay so I know I've said
it's awesome a lot of times but I'm
gonna keep I'm gonna keep explaining why
dual channel ddr3 eight pin CPU power
connector usually IT exports only have
four pin power connectors this is to
save space and it is also because the
vrm on them it is even remotely capable
of delivering the kind of current
would require a pen okay so there's no
pen to say 24-pin power connecter okay
to say two three six gigabit per second
ports to say two to three gigabit per
second ports wait a minute no yes yes
one PCIe 16x pcie 3.0 slot so you can
install even a gtx 690 in here and you'd
have full speed for that card you know
full speed no big deal ok chipset
heatsink front USB 3 header 2 front USB
2 headers I mean what ITX case even has
6 front USB ports because no motherboard
has this kind of expansion on it there's
your Wi-Fi card and that mini PCIe slot
and then you got your memo k button
which helps you post more easily you've
got two fan connectors which I guess is
pretty conservative but when you
consider the size of the board it's
pretty reasonable now I'm going to show
you guys the ridiculous part check this
out like look at this look at this
you've got these solid connectors
between a daughter board that actually
does full digital PWM for this board and
is capable of delivering the kind of
current you would normally see on a
desktop board to that CPU socket so they
have managed to do this including
cooling this is all cooling this is all
a big fan heatsink this is oh so they
have managed to do this while retaining
adequate room around the CPU socket and
while staying inside that ITX form
factor but barely
I mean look realistically at how much
additional additional PCB space they
have added to this ITX board by doing
this this daughter board thing which is
awesome so if you're doing like an
overclocked liquid-cooled ITX system and
something like a bit phoenix prodigy or
a silverstone fto three mini or
something like that this is the
motherboard to end all nother boards for
the z77 platform on the back you've got
four USB 2.0 ports four USB 3.0 ports
optical audio hdmi displayport DVI
there's your two antenna spots Gigabit
Ethernet
powered by Intel just like aces all of
these uses z77 boards to esata see most
clear CMOS and flashback okay so those
are two separate buttons for clear CMOS
as well as their bios flashback feature
and then I'm sort of sad to see sort of
ghetto on board audio I would have
rather seen sort of more audio here as
opposed to these however if you're doing
a baller gaming rig you should probably
be using an external USB sound card or
something like that with a system like
this so I'm just gonna find out what the
heck these cables do and then I'll be
back okay turns out all I had to do was
open it up to figure out what it is this
is really cool so because they've to
save space they've actually changed
their normal layout a little bit for the
front panel connectors if you're having
trouble plugging them in you just plug
this whole block in and then these are
all little labeled header extenders that
you can use to plug in your front panel
connectors so aside from performance the
p8z 77 i deluxe delivers convenience
don't forget to subscribe to our next
tech tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and encounter just
take like an oh look at this look at
this thing it's like awesome look at
these look at these solid connectors to
that see see how those go right through
the PCB like very little very little
loss there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
