shout-out to Squarespace thanks for
allowing us to be here at CES 2016
alright so I got a really bright light
in my eyes for this video almost is
bright is the concept TV behind me so
this is not a real product it doesn't
have a real name but what it does have
is a very real presence here in the
Samsung booth this is their 170 inch s
UHD TV yes 170 inches of high dynamic
range premium certified 4k entertainment
now what is HDR premium great question
now Samsung's gonna have a lot of HDR
certified TVs this year which is
effectively a higher range of colors
available this is enabled by their
quantum technology as well as some
tweaks that they've made to the contrast
capabilities of their TVs this year but
there's an additional certification HDR
premium that basically means if you've
got HDR content coming in it's gonna do
the best that it possibly can to achieve
the depth of color that the content was
originally created with now so for the
one behind me
we're talkin this thing can cover 96% of
the DCI color space so that's what you'd
expect out of a high-end projector
theater setup and I mean it actually
bears a lot of other similarities to a
high-end theater setup but why don't we
move on to something a little bit more
realistic for now yeah so that thing I
said just there that was a total lie
because this is also a concept display
so the one behind me is pretty freakin
sick they're showing off this completely
borderless set of little square displays
that they're actually rearranging on the
fly with really no information other
than that that they're willing to give
me I don't know if it's OLED I don't
know if it's LCD I don't know how many
of them you can put together and I don't
know how much it would cost I don't know
if it's intended for the home or purely
for digital signage I basically know
nothing about it other than the fact
that when they put them together there
is a tiny little line where the displays
meet that you can own
really see when you view it off axis and
they are moving them around in a come
obviously the content created for it is
custom but they are moving it around in
such a way that the image is being
displayed well I mean whatever you're
looking at it you get the point
pretty freakin amazing right but it
actually gets a little bit better than
that yes friends this one right here is
a bit more of a practical demonstration
of that technology we just looked at and
one where we can see that it's capable
of doing more than just these kind of
you know flat graphical design type
things that we had going on before so
you can see what's going on behind me
right now is these two of those modular
panels are actually reconfiguring
themselves from a more standard 16 by 9
aspect ratio so the kind of thing where
you would have your typical HD TV
content coming in on to a more cinematic
21 by 9 aspect ratio which is quite
close to what many of your favorite and
most iconic films are shot on so imagine
that the ability to actually make use of
all of the real estate of the TV that
you've purchased without having to deal
with any black bars now of course for
the price that you're likely to pay for
one of these if and when they were to
ever be produced you could probably just
buy a 16 by 9
like top-of-the-line TV and a 21 by 9
top-of-the-line TV and like build
yourself like a sweet ass like motorized
thing to move one of them out of the way
when you got the other content but it's
all about what the technology can do
right well it's concept corner so I
guess so alright guys so don't miss any
of our CES 2016 coverage by making sure
you're subscribed to Linus tech tips
also huge thanks to Squarespace for
sending us to the show this year if you
