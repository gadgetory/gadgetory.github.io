phone on the market is gonna firmly
eventually if you run something
intensive on it for long enough so
whether it's a video editing program or
a graphically intensive game your
performance is gonna start right around
here and it's gonna end up somewhere
right around here but what we don't know
is how does that difference in
performance between a peak and a sustain
state get impacted by installing a phone
case because here's the thing most cases
on the market are designed for
ruggedness or looks or
cost-effectiveness and I haven't seen
any that I can think of that appear to
be designed for thermal conduction so
are we all just taking our mobile
devices and installing a great big
insulator on it and how much of an
impact does that have
we're gonna find out private Internet
access that's exactly what you'll get
with PIAA a safe and protected IP and
it's got loads of other features as well
check it out at the link in the video
description
before we can determine how much a case
affects thermal throttling we need to
set a baseline for how our devices
thermal throttle without any case
installed at all now in the interest of
fairness we're going to be testing both
camps so representing Android we've got
the Galaxy S ten plus and representing
the iPhone we've got the iPhone 10's max
which side do you want to play for today
team iPhone team Android team iPhone and
doing it so we're gonna use Geekbench
and we're going to do subsequent runs
just like I did in my phone water
cooling video a couple years ago to see
how our performance tracks over time
three two one go you have a percentage
bar I just have a timer yeah all right
I've got my first score much lower than
my fifth run for the iPhone is 11 318
what was the Goucher and the Samsung is
ten nine three five so that's it ten
runs and we've got kind of some bad news
like my phone's definitely hot yes it
was this one all along the back is
really warm to the hand but I'm getting
the exact same scores that I was at the
beginning almost to the point same with
the iPhone so obviously they're not
thermal throttling I messaged my buddy
in from a non tech he said one of the
ways that they get phones to thermal
throttle is they run a battery test for
an extended period of time like 10 15 20
minutes okay and then they run the test
instead of just running the test
manually over and over again we did 10
tests do you think that was enough or
should we have done 20 or 25 I don't
know let's try his way okay and see what
happens so let's start the Geekbench
battery benchmark I'm gonna crank up my
screen brightness because that affects
your thermals as well and go okay so
it's been over 20 minutes now they're
already super hot so now let's run the
cpu tests for ten iterations we've got a
problem
even after preheating it and then
running our ten benchmarks in a row
again we're still ending up with all of
our scores within margin of error okay
so one of the things I've heard is that
Android handset manufacturers will
purposely tune their devices to check
what software is being run and
it's a benchmark program it'll actually
allow the phone to heat up more than it
normally would
before thermal throttling the processor
so one of the ways that you can mitigate
that is to use a program called an apk
extractor grab the apk the install file
for the app off the phone
rename it to something else then put it
back on so if you change the name of the
program it won't be on their whitelist
anymore
some of them will will behave that way
the problem though is that that doesn't
help us with the iPhone no because we
can't slide little stuff on an iPhone
and there's not that many tests for this
kind of stuff in the App Store like they
have an - - but I've run it six times
now there's no change fortunately they
are still 3dmark last chance this has to
work so how do we gonna run this one on
the iPhone it's a little different than
Android I'm gonna use slingshot extreme
unlimited which pretends that there's no
such thing as vsync and lets it just run
as fast as it can
off screen and then I'm gonna use
slingshot extreme unlimited OpenGL ES
3.0 one as my option here and then I'm
gonna go ahead and run okay so what do
we want to do ten runs here better
ranked at 12 odd choice you just never
know what's gonna happen I don't trust
it okay so I got my first baseline score
four or five - three second test is
about to finish four three zero zero Wow
that's lower yet dropped again 3479 oh
this time it wasn't higher back to being
lower 3350 dropping even more 31:48
slightly higher 32 10 lower again 31 1-5
final round
lowest score yet 30 78 a clear trend so
we had that one outlier where it kind of
spiked back up but then other than that
this is gonna be really easy to map
against yeah 6006 I'm down a little bit
this one's actually back up again 60
53:59 44 wait what 44 95 that's it baby
we just dropped 25 prick
we're throttling now I think it's not
gonna go back up like feel that that's
hot like it's really hot I just don't
know if it's gonna keep going down
further so you can either be like up
here and then crash and like just kind
of to tears or it could crash
and then keep going down like sloping
yeah 45:29 4473 4538 final test
44 97 we know what we're looking for
with the iPhone we're looking for either
a faster decay or steeper curve yeah or
a slower decay if maybe the case aids in
cooling or it falls farther if it gets
harder than it ever did and performs
worse than it ever did and then with the
s 10 plus we're looking for whether it
will hold for as many runs or fewer runs
or more runs before it throttles down
and maybe drops farther than ever
or maybe drops further okay so do the
shopping mall charge it
I do not belong in here should we try
one of these leather wallet ones that
looks like that traps heat big time 10s
max leather case oops
about the leather case this thing is 70
Canadian dollars after-tax that's crazy
hey buddy I'm looking for cases for
Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus and iPhone 10's
max normal silicon little beefier Galaxy
iPhone kind of comfortable
what do you got okay so I got a
selection for you I tried to go from the
most basic case you could have wow
that's a really basic case yeah you paid
more for that than you'd like to know so
that's for the iPhone and then that's
for the Samsung so we're seeing if that
maybe insulates it more yeah so then one
level up from that is semi rugged sure
like that one oh my God look at that
what is up with that they just put it on
a little stand to spray painted and then
I got you some wallet cases okay and
then I got you the actual official
leather case from the Apple store you
don't want to know 70 US dollars not you
are Canadian appalling can we return
this so let's start with the most basic
cases oh this thing sucks look at it
it's like jiggly in there this is basic
buy like every definition and go so
we're finished our 12 runs for our
Android device we ended up with
basically exactly the same behavior we
throttle that the same run and down to
the same amount so as far as we can tell
putting a really sort of basic plastic
case on your phone is not going to have
any noticeable impact pretty much the
same story with the iPhone as well
except there's a little bit of problems
with 3d mark on this one it crashed
around test 2 so we couldn't just
pretend that guess three counter does
test 2 right because it's actually run
for more time now it is getting it
hotter so we did an extra test test 13
but even with all that it's pretty much
the same results as no case the trend
line is still very similar so I it's
hard to draw a conclusion yet shall we
move on to the rugged case yes all right
let's do it yeah this is exactly the
same that surprises me actually I had me
too I would have thought as we go into
thicker cases I mean they're made out of
things that are not known to be
excellent heat conductors I guess these
aren't the most rugged cases this isn't
an otterbox or anything but it's like a
lot more substantial than this but I
guess it doesn't make a difference
all right wallet case time and that's
the same okay do you want to try running
them with the case is closed
yes now that's interesting
so on the iPhone we not only throttle
immediately and harder we actually end
up at a significantly lower steady state
so it looks like the iPhone 10's max
actually relies in a very significant
way on its screen for cooling which
makes me wonder then why didn't covering
the back matter okay so I'm done not
that there's still the Apple branded
leather case the $70 leather case I know
writer if you have any theories like
you're a motorcyclist you wear leather
so there's no wind going through I
wouldn't say that my experience with
leather is that it feels more insulating
than plastic though so okay so we're
done with the leather case that's it
actually kind of beat the base better
than a bear phone I mean barely
it's probably just margin or error I'd
gas but it's definitely not worse it's
not worse definitely not worse so
unfortunately this video didn't end up
being the make your phone run faster
with this easy trick conclusion that we
had maybe hoped for
so what we found from all of our testing
is that phones thermal throttle
absolutely if dependent on the workload
and unless you're going out of your way
to do something particularly stupid like
enclose your phone in a non breathable
insulating material it's probably not
going to have a huge impact on the
performance of your device this is a
good answer Linus that means we can have
our performance and protection - this is
the world we want to live in so this is
like the ultra thin animal skin condom I
only use recycled condoms inside joke
from the roast go watch it
holy crap pop G sponsored - tech tips

checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description to be clear we're not
recommending that mold kiosk but you
know if it's really hard to get this up
to tight fit maybe we recommend the
Apple genuine leather case I'm not sure
about that one either also down there is
our merch store which has cool shirts
like that one and our community forum
but you guys should totally join we have
shirts kind of like this one but we
don't have a long-sleeve yet we're
working on I want that oh there it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
