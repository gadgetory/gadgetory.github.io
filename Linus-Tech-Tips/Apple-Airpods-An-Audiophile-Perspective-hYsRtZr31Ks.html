I've never felt better look what I got
I just paid over $300 for a pair of ear
pods wireless earphones from some guy on
Craigslist without having done any
research whatsoever I don't know what
devices they work with I don't know what
kind of battery life to expect and I
don't know if they sound good all I know
is they're the newest product from Apple
and I need them so let's find out are
they air amazing or pedestrian
need a new mouse and keyboard check out
the Cougar gaming attack x3 mechanical
keyboard and revenger gaming mouse at
the link in the video description I've
got to give Apple this the pairing
process with iOS devices is pretty
magical just pop the lid open on the air
pods charging case hold it near your
phone press the button and you're
greeted by a handy-dandy battery
indicator for both the air pods
themselves and the charging case as a
not really Apple person MacBook pairing
was a little less straightforward for me
the auto pairing through iCloud did work
but Apple's instructions simply say
select air pods in the menu bar and I
didn't realize I had to manually enable
the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar
before that would work for an on Apple
device setup is still easy but less
magical hold the button select them in
your Bluetooth menu and wait about a
second then you can get on with your
hamilton fix that is unless someone
interrupts you taking out one side mid
playback was my first experience with
another magical feature of the air pods
they're onboard accelerometers that let
them start and stop playback when
they're inserted or removed from your
ears as someone who actually does wear
earphones all day this design choice
smacks of made by people who don't do
that because I often find myself working
with one side in to increase my
awareness of my surroundings the good
news is that within the bluetooth menu
Apple allows this setting to be changed
along with the behavior of a DoubleTap
on the stem which can trigger Siri or
play pause media playback the bad news
is that unlike the wired equivalents the
air pods rely on clunky voice control
for volume adjustments and track
skipping voice control that doesn't work
without an active internet connection
for Siri and while these settings are
stored on the air pods themselves and
carry over to other devices there
doesn't appear to be any way to
configure them in the first place
without using an apple
vice of course if they don't offer a
compelling balance of portability
convenience value and sound quality I
doubt many Android users will be queuing
up to buy them anyway so how do they
fare in this regard the answer is okay
the charging case is small enough to fit
in my pocket much smaller and lighter
than Bragi zaluman 'm 1 and smaller than
the case I already carry for my IE ATS
and a lightning dongle it's bigger than
Jaybirds charging adapter for the
freedoms but that doesn't have its own
battery on board so it's not really an
apples to apples comparison with that
said you are less likely to need a
charging case with the freedoms since
the air pods dropped 50% of their
battery after working on this video for
a few hours listening to them only
intermittently as for sound quality
they're sure not worth what I had to pay
for them but as Bluetooth earphones go
the auto switching between the
integrated microphones in both ear pods
works really well they've got great
range even without line-of-sight to my
phone with a low enough noise floor that
I didn't perceive any background hiss
and they've got a pleasing enough sound
signature that I think most people will
have no complaints base is punchy and
not overdone mids and highs are
serviceable and as someone who normally
uses IMS I actually really enjoyed their
more open natural sound are they as good
as audiophile earphones like my daily
driver ie ATS no don't be stupid and I
like the fact that they fit in my ears
more snugly than normal ear pods without
the weight of the wires but I don't
think I personally would trade away
inline controls and a much lower price
for that small benefit not to mention
that there are literally thousands of
earphones out there that aren't ear pods
then again if you're the type of person
who treats headphones as a fashion
statement I don't think they look nearly
as weird as my initial impressions when
Apple unveiled them and they aren't
priced VAT outlandishly
compared to other
accessories or even other wireless
earphones speaking of better lighting
we're teaming up with Tesoro to give
away one of their Gramm spectrum
keyboards and one of theirs own balance
gaming chairs the Graham features
tactile low-profile key switches all of
which are fully programmable and which
features sixteen point eight million
color RGB lighting and a braided cable
and the zone balance features a sturdy
steel frame a heightened backrest with
adjustable armrests and backrest and
polyurethane Follet er all you gotta do
to enter is watch the video and enter
through our link in the description
alright thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome get subscribed hit that
like button and maybe leave a comment
letting me know if you prefer the more
sick Linus sound to my normal voice
which is what I'm doing right now or if
you'd rather I just go back to being a
yappy little chihuahua in all of my
videos also linked in the video
description I don't think I gave you a
link in the video description that's
okay is where to buy the stuff we
featured at Amazon and a link to our
community forum as well as our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one now that you're done doing all that
stuff you're probably wondering what to
watch next so click that little button
in the top right corner to check out my
review of the braggy - which has gotten
some firmware updates since I did that
but it has not fixed the Bluetooth range
I did check that while I was working on
