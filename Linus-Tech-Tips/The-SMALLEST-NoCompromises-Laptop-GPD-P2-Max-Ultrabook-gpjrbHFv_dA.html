the sky ambitious IndieGoGo project
because we never know when something
might take forever to ship or even turn
out to be an outright scam and make us
look bad
because people think that we were
promoting it so if just anyone had
reached out and said hey hey Linus come
on over here
we're making the world's smallest
Ultrabook go check out our IndieGoGo
page we'd probably have close to the
email and continue doing the very very
important things that we do around here
but it wasn't just anyone
it was GPD technology who has a very
respectable pedigree when it comes to
designing and building super compact
windows and gaming devices so then this
is it the p2 max it's the world's
smallest Ultrabook and it is shockingly
usable you know what else is shocking
the smoothness of that Segway to our
sponsor a private Internet access
P ia features fast multi gigabit VPN
tunnel gateways worldwide so if you're
looking for a VPN you can learn more
about P ia at the link in the video
description
so on paper the p2 max is the closest
thing to a bonafide laptop in GP DS
lineup yet it's got an 8.9 inch screen
so that's about the size of the smallest
Acer Aspire One netbook from back in the
day
but at a much higher resolution it's got
touchscreen support and even stylus
input support it's only 650 grams so
that's a little under one and a half
pounds for our American friends and it
sports up to 16 gigs of lpddr3 memory
this is pretty cool it's got a
fingerprint sensor for Windows hello so
you just go ahead and boots up just like
that and the IO is competitive with even
some full-sized laptops that I've seen
so you've got a full size USB type-a on
the left along with a three-and-a-half
millimeter jack then over on the right
you've got a micro HDMI now I'm not a
huge fan of this connector because it is
quite fragile but the saving grace here
is that you've also got a full size USB
type A so that's two of those as well as
a USB type-c
and USB type-c makes so much sense for a
device like this because with one dongle
and this is one that I carry around all
the time I can go here we go power in
Gigabit Ethernet three more USB type
days a full size HDMI and of course an
SD and a microSD slot pretty darn
portable so I want to do a full shutdown
here so we can have a look at what the
boot time is like from cold
a sec pretty quick shut down dang
wow that was a cold boot not too bad now
with that said the fan does ramp up
pretty loud on first boot it does settle
in once your background processes finish
launching and all that but it's
definitely audible now after first boot
and spending some time just you know
navigating the OS you know
launching browser logging into my email
all that kind of stuff there were a few
observations that I made about usability
first and foremost being that the
trackpad is in my opinion the weakest
point of the device and that really
surprised me not because it looked
really amazing or anything but because
usually these subcompact devices have
their keyboards as their biggest flaw
now for the trackpad the size here it is
usable like you can see I can get most
of the way across the screen at a pretty
natural speed but it still felt like a
big compromise and the movement
rejection while clicking made the cursor
move around a little bit more than I'd
like causing me to miss on my
double-click sometimes so it just wasn't
that smooth to use by contrast however
the keyboard which I expected to be the
sole reason that I wouldn't find a
device like this usable if it ended up
being really well-balanced like here's a
thing compared to here here we go
compared to their pocket - they only had
an extra about I don't know what would
you say that's about an inch and change
to work with but I guess this is still
more evidence that
every inch can make a big difference to
the experience so what we lose on the p2
max is a dedicated Delete key but I'm ok
with that because function delete is
pretty good but what we gain is much
better spaced arrow keys a much more
favorable layout in terms of hitting
things like period and comma down here
we get better spacing between the keys
this feels a lot more cramped than this
one does it makes a shockingly big
difference and this feeling of being
less cramped is especially evident right
here along the left side of the keyboard
where escape tab caps lock shift and
control are all in reasonably natural
positions now that's not to say that it
doesn't take some getting used to the
idiosyncrasies of this layout for
example instead of your semicolon and
apostrophe your right pinky is now enter
although at least period and comma are
reasonably easy to reach down here as
our forward slash and your apostrophe
right here and then the other really big
one is the fact that there's only a
single control and a single alt so if
you wanted to perform something like alt
f4 you've got to kind of do that and
then oh right only a single shift that
one does still bother me but I also
understand why they went this way and I
don't see how I could have done it any
better now moving on to the display it's
a sixteen by ten display which some of
you probably already noticed because it
is a big deal and it makes the screen
feel much bigger than it is both because
you get that extra vertical space which
amounts to less scrolling through
content when you're reading and because
it actually is physically larger than an
equal sized sixteen by nine screen about
two and a half percent bigger now how
happy you're going to be with the CPU
performance of a machine like this is
going to depend heavily on your
expectations it's still only two hyper
threaded cores so I mean I was sitting
at around 65 to 70 per g√∂th Chrome
it was interrupting full-screen video to
prompt me to set it to default Wow like
I'm already using you so I was sitting
at around 65 to 70 percent CPU usage
while I was installing premiere and
launching steam for the first time and I
actually spiked to a hundred percent
while installing cross-code with the fan
clearly audible above the HVAC in my
office but at least that fan noise does
come with a benefit the m3 80 100 why in
this thing managed to turbo up to 2.6
2.7 gigahertz under full all core loads
and I even saw a spikes as high as 3
gigahertz while performing moderately
strenuous tasks and that's that's really
impressive when you consider the 1.1
gigahertz base clock of the CPU and this
thing so in the real world then this
aggressive turbo behavior along with its
support for hyper threading and the very
pleasant surprise of a full pci express
gen3 x4 link to the p2 maxes nvme SSD
boot drive translated into not I fast
but a very responsive experience like
it's really not bad you know let's here
let's go ahead and launch a game or
something like here's a game that I've
never launched on this thing just
installed it for lulz like that's it's
portal it's not heavy but that's a quick
game launch so it's that responsiveness
that I think gives GPD some credibility
when they say that this is an ultrabook
as opposed to a netbook because light
productivity uses like Photoshop are
absolutely possible and in an emergency
even light video editing was possible to
be clear I'm not endorsing switching to
any dual core ultrabook as your premier
Pro workstation but here's a little
project that I did is a floatplane
exclusive behind the scenes it's just
shot on my phone 1080p so it's not heavy
footage but the thing is in spite of the
100% usage for both the CPU and GPU it's
actually
prising lee responsive to work on now
coming back to some more likely use
cases for a machine like this it's AC
Wi-Fi speeds were really good
I managed 300 mega bit both up and down
on our high-speed connection here in our
office so that resulted in fast
downloads responsive web browsing and
fast cloud synchronization and it was
also actually a really good experience
for steam in-home streaming or I think
they call it remote play now so with
that I can actually play desktop games
off of machines elsewhere in the office
here so here you go let's go ahead and
fire up some rocket leagues shall we so
this makes for a really impressive
experience because it's running at
native resolution 2560 by 1600 60 frames
per second and thing is that normally
you would get some compression artifacts
when you are streaming over the network
instead of running you know natively on
the PCs display except that because this
display is so small it actually ends up
looking shockingly clean oops
oh yeah like it looks so sharp and
watching 4k YouTube videos was honestly
equally impressive so here's one of our
videos running at 4k 30fps I'm gonna go
ahead and alt-tab out of this and you
can see our onboard Intel UHD 615
graphics are running at about 25% and
our CPU is sitting in the you know 20 to
25% range and even more impressively is
not even at base clock so it's actually
in a power saving state right now while
smoothly playing back 4k video and you
know I think really watching 4k YouTube
is one of the best use cases for this
device the screen is super sharp thanks
to its 2560 by 1600 resolution it's
bright it's tuned fairly neutrally so
you won't end up with that Best Buy
showroom experience out of the box and
the size of it allows it to sit nicely
in between the inn
convenience of pulling a full-size
laptop out of your bag and the tiny
whiny ice tray no vision of watching
content on your phone see look at that
looks like right in between alright
let's go ahead and crack this thing open
really the most impressive thing about
this thing was that it never really felt
slow like it didn't feel fast all the
time but I never was like sitting there
going wow I'm really just waiting around
for this thing so let's have a let's
have a look at the internals here so
there's our processor dual core hyper
threaded as I mentioned before Intel
Wi-Fi chip right there here's our RAM so
it looks like they've soldered that on
to the board rather than using a sodimm
and I guess they've got a good reason
for it because when I checked inside
hardware info I actually found that the
RAM is running in dual channel mode at
least on the 16 gig version so that's
really nice because there will be a
performance benefit there the battery is
a 35 watt hour affair that actually
takes up a very significant portion of
the internals of the device here so you
can see it's the full thickness of the
thing and actually the only thing over
here on this side of it seems to be the
small dotter board for i/o and then
finally we've got a pretty good look at
the cooling system here so that's our
regrettably pretty whiny little fan and
then we've got a single heat pipe
running from the CPU which of course has
the graphics built into it over to a
small heat exchanger that exhausts here
at the back of the unit overall there's
not much for me to complain about build
quality wise they are using a single
unibody piece of aluminum so you can
actually see even with the bottom cover
off there's not a ton of flex here and
unlike their previous devices I was
actually very pleasantly surprised by
the quality of the speakers in the p2
max they're not amazing but they are
definitely usable and at least their
stereo and obviously the Flex is even
better once you actually put the bottom
on the thing so the conclusion here is I
think it's obvious that I have a bit of
a soft spot for a DPD I mean to be clear
they've never responds
or anything like that and I've never
even met anyone there face to face I
guess I just can't excuse some of the
compromises that they make in their
designs because I respect someone who's
willing to do things differently instead
of just making the same bloody thing as
everyone else over and over and over
again like it's it's kind of like what I
said about the original LG Graham like
yeah it had some build quality issues
and honestly so does the P to max
there's more rattle in the trackpad than
I'd like though they may fix that for
mass production but LG had a goal make
the lightest device and damn it they
accomplished that so same thing here
yeah you're gonna have to change some of
your typing habits but assuming that
you've got pretty good eyes and you can
handle the smaller screen you will be
carrying around a shockingly functional
and convenient device that weighs just
one and a half pounds and this
absolutely blew my mind even though like
it shouldn't like it it makes sense it
charges off of a 30 watt quick charge
phone adapter that's pretty freaking
cool so even though the P 2 max isn't
the smallest device out of GPD I think
it is their best and their most usable
one to date and at around seven hundred
US dollars in the IndieGoGo campaign I
think it's priced not low but definitely
reasonably audible has an amazing
collection of audiobooks and there are a
ton of reasons why you should give
