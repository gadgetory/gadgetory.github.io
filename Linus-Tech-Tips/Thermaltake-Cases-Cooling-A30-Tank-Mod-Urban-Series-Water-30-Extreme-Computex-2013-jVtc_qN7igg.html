powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM
so we're kicking things off at the
Thermaltake booth with a pretty freakin
cool set of case mods here so this one
right here is an a 30 case but you'd
hardly recognize it with the World of
Tanks mod that we got going on
so a rotating turret has been placed on
the top of the case with a little gunner
guy here and a big gun right here now
the a 30 is actually an N ATX case is
optimized for air flow you've got a
couple of frosted windows on either side
as well as ventilation for your graphics
card as well as for the CPU memory area
on the other side other than that it's a
pretty standard layout you got a couple
five and a quarter inch base on the
front though you can hardly see them
with all of the you know enormous you
know tank extensions that we got going
on on the front here USB to USB 3 s8 I
still like to see eSATA it's still a
faster standard now my understanding is
this thing actually moves can you please
take it down for the audience and and
all right thank you this is going to be
this is gonna be pretty cool we asked
them to take them down and drive them
around for us they were kind of like
yeah okay so here we go guys we are
gonna be we're gonna be firing firing my
laser so to speak show us show us how
it's done
whoa oh there we go check that out so
the treads actually move one of the you
got a Turner turn that around so one of
the other cool things about this case is
it has a very modular design allowing
you to take it apart completely and oh
no this is what happens at trade shows
should we try the other one hey there we
go all right we're moving so you can
take the whole case apart build your PC
and then put the whole thing back
together due to the modular design now
it doesn't have quite the same terrain
climbing ability as an actual tank but
without further ado I think we'll show
you some actual case designs that you
can buy from thermaltake as opposed to
crazy modded ones oh yeah we didn't see
this before but the gun the gun kind of
fires here which is pretty cool oh oh
they're aiming at me they're aiming at
the camera aiming at the camera okay so
they're not tanks but the urban series
is getting a serious overhaul so the C
series is getting aluminum front panels
these are all the urban cases are quiet
optimized with that said you can get
them with windowed side panels however
if you wanted the ultimate in silence
obviously you would lean towards the one
with the plain side panel that has noise
dampening material on it there's a full
line of of different cases here so
everything from larger tower cases to m8
the X tower cases as well as even over
here
you've got between the s1 and the sd1 2m
ATX versions one of which is a tower and
one of which is a more of a desktop case
ER or a cube case moving around to this
side we've got again more urban cases so
available in multiple colors now
multiple designs but again all with that
quiet optimized design and of course
these are brand new cases so you've got
all the updated feature sets such as
things like front USB 3 ports and let's
move all the way over here I just want
you guys to check out this is the s71
Snow Edition this is here we go lots and
lots of room for all the hardware's
inside this one now of course you're
gonna need cooling for all that stuff
whether you want silence optimized or
performance optimized and this right
here is their new NIC series of coolers
so this is the Nick c5 inside here and
what Nick stands for is network
interface card
however that is not
what we mean in this context you can see
there is some higher profile of X CRM
next to this cooler and they are demoing
see how the wave the shroud actually
overlaps with the fan rather than just
building a bulky cooler and then
strapping a fan to it they're going for
a slimmer profile that allows you to use
high profile memory right next to your
CPU cooler without running into any
random interference that causes all
kinds of problems even with something
like an X 79 motherboard where you can
have four dims on each side another side
effect of this is that if you have very
high memory modules such as corsair
dominator Platinum's you're actually
going to get some incidental cooling for
them as well because that 120 millimeter
fan is going to be sitting right next to
it so let's go over to where the rest of
the NIC series is on display over here
we're gonna move as quickly as we can so
there are a wide variety of these
coolers some of them with high
performance looking shrouds some of them
that are more more basic options but of
course you guys watch Linus tech tips so
you know we're all about the liquid
cooling the water line of products is
getting an update already so water 3.0
extreme the changes here are tuning to
the water block itself as well as to the
design of the fans that have allowed
Thermaltake to maintain that same
performance that we were so impressed
with with the water 2.0 extreme but with
a slimmer radiator which is going to
improve case compatibility so I've
really looked forward to seeing if they
did pull that off because that was one
of the things that I really liked about
the extreme 2.0 was just the fact that
it did outperform other dual 120
millimeter liquid coolers and then
there's of course the pro series as well
as performance line so that's a slim rad
single 120 millimeter and then the so
that's the performer and then the pro is
a thick rad 120 millimeter and they all
feature two fans either in push-pull or
simply in a pole or push configuration
for the extreme so this has been our
coverage of the thermal take booth from
Computex 2013 don't forget to subscribe
