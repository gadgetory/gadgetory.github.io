XCOM hey guys I'm here at the ducky
booth I know a lot of you that know me
who's watch the live stream who's been
on the forum should have probably
expected this I was pretty excited I
heard they're here at sea I almost just
said CES at Computex but I wasn't sure
where because I couldn't find them on
any of the actual convention floors but
I hunted them down and found they're
sweet so we got up here and there's some
really cool stuff that I'm pretty
excited for first I'm not going to go
way too into depth of this but this is
the ducky mini it's just the main typing
zone and it's very very cool for very
portable users there's a detachable
cable on the back green backlight but I
believe you can get two different colors
green and blue more than that so you can
get tons of different backlighting
colors that's awesome
we're not gonna spend too much time on
that those very pre-production sample
what I was really really excited for is
the ducky shine 3 this is the aluminium
body 1 which is what I really really
want but they're not necessarily sure if
they're going to release it make sure
you comment in the comments and make
sure you hammer their Facebook with how
much you actually want an aluminum body
keyboard this thing is awesome it feels
great it's got nice nice weight to it
because it does have an aluminum body
this is their current stock spacebar
although it might be changing as this is
a very very early sample now I could
spend too much time on this one because
like I just said fairly sample slide
down here we get to again ducky shine 3
although with the year of the snake
space bar I'm gonna kind of skip over
this really really quickly jump up to
the year of the snake keyboard this one
has a stock spacebar they're still not
sure what space where they're going to
go for they have these three more here
the snake stylized ones that we saw here
there isn't huge differences between
them this one's my current favorite but
they're just totally awesome again
comment here slam their Facebook page
tell them which one you want he's a
great great looking space bars great
great looking keyboard it's got the camo
colour all over it and just looks
absolutely awesome if that's a style
keyboard you want if you've got a c7 T
or any military scut styled case like
that that would go amazingly amazingly
well with your build nice green key caps
backlit all the fixin's if we jump down
here again the ducky shine 3 as a lot of
you are probably waiting to see
don't spend too much times on these
their custom caps I just want to show
them off because they're awesome hey
guys sorry about that we're gonna just
jump right into the lighting modes here
so right now we're basically off then we
go to the next lighting mode gets a 60%
go the next lighting mode we get 100%
full keyboard backlighting next lighting
mode this is breathing you can see it's
going quite quickly right now we can
slow it all the way down to a nice
smooth pace
go all the way back up to disco level
speed and just watch it go absolutely
crazy okay
we're gonna switch lighting once again
this is reactive typing mode give me one
second here there we go sorry about that
so this will make it bright light up
right away and then disappear right away
this is a really cool mode I like this
on my ducky dragon that I already have
if we switch the next mode you'll see
it's very similar but now it takes a
little bit of its own time to fade out
which is just absolutely awesome the
only problem I had with reactive typing
mode was while you're typing by the time
your finger moves away you can't
actually see the light now it actually
kind of stays there for a while so if
you're typing up an absolute storm and
someone's watching you you can actually
see all the keys as you're typing which
is just very cool I'm obviously typing
just complete gibberish right now as I'm
doing with my left hand but that's
awesome the only complaint I've ever
heard about reactive typing mode as it
goes too quickly so they addressed that
problem very very well when we switch
here to wave mode which is also really
cool I'm going to slow it down here so
you can see it better but it just goes
along the keyboard and just looks very
very smooth we can make it go really
really fast again you can have a disco
in your room with this keyboard very
easily I'm gonna switch the next mode
this is snake mode it reminds me a lot
of their marquee mode and it just goes
across the keyboard I can slow it down
again and when when the guy showing me
these keyboards showed me this all I
could think of was the actual game of
snake I think it would be really really
funny if they had randomly scattered lit
up keys along the keyboard and the snake
could grow as it picked them up I just
think that'd be hilarious although it's
not practical at all and makes no real
sense I think would be hilarious then we
come back and we're back to off so
basically with shine 3 they tried to
pick every single
oscillating mode you could ever imagine
actually one thing that I mixed missed
was the delay and delay rate which makes
it so that as you hold down a key
depending on how you set it it will go
up and down really really really quickly
in the software so without you tapping
like this if you just hold it down you
can make it go insanely fast how I think
all that is for gaming I'm not entirely
sure because you're kind of taking a
cheap advantage but that's up to you
you're buying a really nice keyboard
maybe you should have that advantage I'm
not sure discuss that in comments if you
want this is pretty nuts they put every
single lighting mode you could want as I
said before you still have all the dip
switch options you had with their
previous keyboards this is crazy
a lot of you that nobody noby I'm
completely nerding out here another
thing that I forgot to mention is
there's a new wrist rest that they're
not sure if they're gonna release as
well but this looks really sharp
personally I like their older leather
models more but just if you want the
more plexiglas feel and you want their
awesome logo on the side you can have
that as well another thing is they now
have a zero shine so basically it's a
zero that comes in I believe blue and
green blue and orange okay so you have
blue and orange backlight zero it's only
slightly more expensive as the previous
zero that wasn't backlit so all you guys
that want a cheap entry-level mechanical
keyboard that has backlighting on it
this is a great great option thank you
