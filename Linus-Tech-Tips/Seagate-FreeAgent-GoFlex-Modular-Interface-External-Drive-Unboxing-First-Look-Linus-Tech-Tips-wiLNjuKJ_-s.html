product I've never seen anything like
this it involves five boxes for one
thing and this is the seagate freeagent
goflex ultra portable drive now when
this was first explained to me it was
basically said that it's a an external
hard drive that doesn't come with any
cables and I went well that's not really
very innovative is it but it's actually
a little bit different from that what it
is is it's an external hard drive that
doesn't have an interface so it actually
has a modular interface and the bridge
chip and cable is all part of one
adapter so here why don't we take the e
SATA one for example and let's open this
up really quick so oh i sure wish i had
a knife today but i appear to not have
one so what i'll be doing is i'll just
be kind of like shredding the boxes open
because that is how i roll so just open
that there we go so this is the esata
one and it's advertised right here as up
to six times faster than USB 2 so this
is for go flex and go flex pro ultra
portable drives okay so right here this
is what it looks like this is a power to
SATA port i believe yep this is a power
D SATA port so as long as you have
powered e-sata then all you do is you
plug this into the back of the drive so
it's got a Santa interface right there
plugs in clips in with the clips right
here and then you've got an e SATA cable
and that's it so the whole thing is is
all attached as one unit rather than
having a hard drive enclosure and then a
bunch of interfaces on the back that you
plug cables into so this way you'll
never lose the cable I guess is one
benefit okay so why don't we do the next
one this is USB 3.0 SB 3 point 0 2 SATA
adapter and bridge chip so the chip is
actually inside here so it's inside the
bottom of this and then you just plug in
your SATA and then it goes right to a
USB 3 port now usb3 actually provides a
substantial amount more power than USB 2
did so it should be no problem to power
two and a half inch drive off the USB 3
port I believe it's what is it i think
it's three times the power of us be too
although i could be wrong
I could be mistaken the next one we have
is the USB 3.0 get so what makes it a
kit it's an upgrade cable kit includes
everything you need to upgrade your
laptop to USB 3 so this is not only the
okay why don't you see what this is so
first of all you've got the same cable
we had last time so you've got a USB 3
and there and then you have a say to
interface here both power and data and
then in the back you have a manual you
know they probably all come with manuals
these talk about your warranty it's in
about 25 different languages and he's
got a quick start guide okay so there's
an express card in here somewhere oh
here it is so in the back of the plastic
tray there's an express card for your
laptop so you can upgrade your laptop to
USB 3.0 and then you can plug it in well
okay this is interesting ok so the
laptop will actually need external power
from a USB port and then you will use
that as well as the power coming from
the Express card port so you plug ok
here here's how this works if you plug
this in here you get one USB 3 port this
plugs into a USB 2 port so you're taking
power here and you're taking power here
and that's what's going to run that port
so that would be a good one if your
laptop does not already support USB 3
which most of them out there do not
right now so then last but not least for
interfaces we have firewire 800 and I
actually don't know if firewire 800
provides a decent power but they're
advertising firewire 800 is up to two
times faster than USB to point it looks
like they've managed to find a way to
make firewire 800 deliver enough power
for the drive because I don't see any
external power adapter all right there
we finally get it we unboxed all of the
different adapters that you can have see
I dropped one so they all are identical
on this end they are all just say to
power say the data and then at the other
ends we have a couple USB 3.0 we've got
an isa
we have a firewire 800 so these are all
much faster than USB to point out but
that doesn't mean that if you buy the
goflex that you're just stuck with no
way to plug it and it actually comes
with a USB to point out there so that
means you can buy it for the price of a
regular USB 2.0 but if you have higher
end hardware that allows you to take
advantage of faster transfer feats then
you just plug it in so this is a one
terabyte drive actually you know what
just a little bit of time on this so
it's USB 3.1 the world's most upgradable
hard drive it comes with easy backup
software as well as secure data
encryption ultraportable it's one
terabyte USB 2.0 it's plug and play
inside the box you've got the goflex
ultra portable drive back up with
encryption software preloaded and TFS
driver for Mac pre-loaded on the drive
you have the USB 2.0 interface adapter
as well as an 18 inch USB 2.0 limited
warranty I think that pretty much covers
everything here upgrades your digital
life add-on accessories sold separately
okay okay so let's get it open them and
have a look at what is inside so this is
the freeagent goflex don't think girl
this isn't the pro one so i don't
actually know what the difference is
between the pro one and the not pro one
and apparently i thought the cameraman
was reaching for a snack then but it
turns out that that is not what is going
on okay so it comes wrapped in plastic
and it's very very shiny so that's a
shiny enclosure so what I'm guessing and
this is a pretty safe guess is that
there are actually two two and a half
inch drives inside here to 500 gig
drives and that's what gives you the one
terabyte capacity you got a seagate logo
here and then the sides are just kind of
a standard shiny plastic and then on the
bottom it's mat so that way when you
actually put it down on the desk which
is how you're likely going to use it
you're not going to scratch it up too
bad as long as you're careful to protect
the top which is probably pretty easy to
scratch in a bit of a fingerprint magnet
you're really new so here we are here's
our USB 2.0 interface cable and this is
going to show us how to plug in the
modular interface cable so just take the
plastic covering off here so that I can
show it to you and it's shiny plastic
glory it's actually feels quite well
built it's quite um like it feels solid
without feeling overly heavy and yeah it
doesn't move around or anything so
that's a good sign so you just plug that
in like that and then it looks like that
there's your USB 2.0 that's interesting
hold on well that's weird none of the
other ones actually have a removable
cable but the USB 2.0 one does so there
you go for whatever reason let me just
double check that yeah none of the other
ones have that but this one does so why
don't we just try to plug it in and see
if it works I'll get into my computer
here take it one step further than I
normally do it in unboxing put that on
the ground hmm there we go it works
excellent so now that I have absolutely
no room on my desk to move my mouse I
will attempt to use my computer so it
comes with a bunch of stuff on it it
comes with a USB 3.1 after driver folder
it comes with a seagate folder which is
registration as well as the Seagate
dashboard and then it also has a set up
which is may or may not be format
because there's a mac install it on the
engene I don't know how to install stuff
on a Mac I forgive me please and then
there's also goflex so that's just an
icon so why don't we run setup and see
what happens feel free to tune out at
any time the unboxing is over thank you
for watching my unboxing don't forget to
subscribe and all that good stuff but
then beyond that I guess we can also
register our product or we cannot do
that I never register this drive and
then
okay it wants to find Seagate dashboard
exe okay so what I think I've managed to
do is screw it up already within about
two seconds of plugging it into my
computer which is a big part of the
reason I often do not try to use the
product on camera because usually I
screwed up and okay I plugged it back in
so we're going to go back into the seat
game folder we're going to install the
Seagate dashboard this time in English
which is good other than the United
States shirt close enough okay so here's
the me meo instant backup simple 60
second back up and then oh you can
install the earth stood back up which
comes with it or you can install a
premium backup trial so free trial
software okay install sure doesn't take
very long to set up by the look in my
cat really likes this dry though you can
see that he's decided that it is his to
lord over here because it's shiny and oh
he also likes the plastic yeah wants to
fight it Viggo okay and it's not done
installing yet so my distraction has
completely failed well now he's
attacking it for more you know what
forget it this is really boring so you
install the software and then you use
the drive where you don't bother
installing the software and you just use
the drive thank you for technion my
unboxing and attempt at using the
product and don't forget to subscribe
