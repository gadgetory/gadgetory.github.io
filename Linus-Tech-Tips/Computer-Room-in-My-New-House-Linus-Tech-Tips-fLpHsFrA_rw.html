been moving over the last few days so
that's why I haven't had that many
videos to upload so obviously the first
room that I worked on more than anything
else is the computer room so follow me
and I'll take you on a little tour of
what is my new computer place so first I
got my system here this is my mighty jo7
with my 30-inch monitor got my cat
speakers hooked up finally now that I'm
into my own place and I don't have to
worry about the the noise bothering
anybody got a whole mess of wires going
on down there I'm doing my best with it
but obviously it's a bit of a challenge
right now before I can buy exactly the
length I need got my subwoofer about an
Onkyo receiver I've had a lot of people
actually asking me about my setup so now
that it's finally done properly I can
actually show you guys on my d-link
router Shaw modem and got a Netgear
gigabit switch going on over there which
leads to second computer in the house
that's the Corsair obsidian thats that
build that I showed you a while back
with the t-virus res that's the 24-inch
monitor steel series I and those Makos
that I unboxed a little while back then
we've got some built-in bookshelves that
are here got a bunch of stuff sort of
piled on there and it's always a work in
progress it's kind of getting there so
here's a view of what the whole room
sort of looks like and where I have
walked now you see this door here is
into my computer storage closet so I got
my test bench I got my like huge thing
full of like cables leaving stuff and I
apologize for the light not being that
great in here you can see it's lit by
one little light bulb up in the corner
but there's a pile of hardware there's a
pile of cables and more cables and more
hardware and this is my like pile of
water cooling gear box a tubing all
kinds of good stuff another test bench
and then which brings me to the other
mystery door in my computer room here
which is another storage closet so in
here Oh lights not on there we go so
this is where I'm storing boxes for
stuff just in case you got a army or
whatever it's good to hold on to some
boxes I got one
or monitor here then I got all my RC
stuff so I've got my my bleed MSR as
well as my Sukhoi however you pronounce
that I don't even know to be perfectly
honest some more random RC stuff and
then I got my Windows Home Server tucked
away so I've run an Ethernet cable
through the wall make sure that I'm
getting Network here and that the home
server can give me nice fast transfer
speeds and it's not even fun whatever
I'm actually using a ball mouse that's
how epically old the stuff hooked up to
my home server is but there you go
anyway that was pretty much all there
was to say about it this is my new
computer room and this is the view out
the front of my new house</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
