someone somewhere was going to invent
something that shouldn't have been
invented science was going to go too far
and it looks like today is that day
this is an early sample of the Lele
streamer streamer streamer straw I'm
gonna go with Strymon an RGB 24-pin
power supply cable
I fix its protec toolkit gives you the
tools you need to tackle any electronics
repair challenge visit ifixit.com
forward slash linus at the link below
and get yours today I have been sent
pretty much no information about this
whatsoever
all I know is that it's RGB and it's one
of the only components of the modern
computer that was still safe
a cable how do you make a cable RGB lit
I mean they've done RGB water cooling
fittings but that like kinda makes sense
because you can illuminate like a thing
that's sitting there but an RGB cable
okay now they're just messing with me we
got like a box within a box there's
probably nothing even in here though to
be clear this is not the finished
packaging nor is it the finished product
but they are apparently looking to
launch this at Computex 2018 so what do
we got here this looks like some kind of
a controller board this fool this
definitely has some hand soldering stuff
going on here you can see that this
molex only has three pins in it
presumably because they don't need
12-volt power and then they've actually
bridged that pin to that okay this is a
power lead for the RGB cable itself and
then we got three buttons back here no
documentation so we're just going to
have to experiment to find out what they
do this is the RGB cable extension so
they haven't found a way to retrofit
your existing power supply to make it
full RGB but they've got this this
harness here that you can plug your
existing one into so you got 12
kind of optical translucent doodads here
you've got some LEDs within this casing
here and then it looks like the whole
thing sits on here all right well let's
start by plugging it all right so the
idea is that whatever color your power
supply cables are they would all be
hidden away you'd plug in this guy so
there's nothing inherently RGB about the
cables themselves let's plug in this guy
so it looks like there's some kind of
daisy chain system where you can plug
this controller board into your first
RGB cable thing and then you can plug
another one into that or something Oh
doesn't look like they thought that one
through I mean it is prototype but like
how am I supposed to get a connector in
there apparently they're considering
changing it out for a SATA connector
anyway which i think would probably be a
good idea oh that's fragile cool that is
a that is not a reinforced this is this
is very prototype okay
this housing is not on here very well
yep right okay okay I can't quite tell
what the pattern is right now is it me
wiggling this wire it's making it poop
you got you got to be kidding me
okay that cannot be intentional there we
go okay so it's a loose contact in their
very prototype 10 out of 10 prototype
okay
oh it clips on to the cable combs not to
the cables themselves so so far the
wiring is fragile and it's a pain in the
butt to install so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna hide away our regular
cable and we're gonna experience the
effect we're gonna have to kill the
light some more it's not that bright
how's that okay let's try some of the
different modes here I think I'm
changing colors right now okay let's try
this other button none of them were
labeled so I'm just kind of guessing
right now hey that one's pretty cool
look who you imagine being the engineer
who's like I went to school for eight
years and they have me designing RGB
animations on a cable and I'm not even
mad I'm just disappointed I think alex
is gonna need this for his rave PC holy
crap there's so many modes really cool
oh you would say that every game that is
awesome
are you just trying to like know what's
so cool annoy people right now it's
really cool like imagine all the cables
being like that can I like take a dump
on your parade a little bit it's not
actually the cable it's just a piece
that sits on top of it still like it
yeah all right so all that's left now
then is to determine how much it affects
performance so we fired up the Unigine
Valley benchmark and and haha I'm just
kidding
in conclusion I'm a little disappointed
in the mechanism I had kind of imagined
that like RGB water cooling fittings we
were gonna have an RGB element within
the housing of the cable over here where
it connects to your stock cable and the
LEDs we're gonna be in there and then
the actual sleeving of the wires was
gonna be some kind of like fiber optic
element or something like that and and
the sleeving itself would glow that was
sort of my expectation and I'm sure
someone's gonna do that at some point
but if you're into that kind of look
like ed and you want your cables to have
something near them if nothing else that
glows RGB with a bazillion and one
animations then I guess
mission accomplished Lindley we have no
idea how much they're gonna cost and we
have no idea where you're gonna get them
or what availability looks like for PCI
Express or 8-pin connectors but there
you have it a world's first RGB 24 pin
computer power cable for better or for
worse the master op fostex TRX zero zero
mahogany headphones are a closed back
pair featuring a magnesium alloy frame
fostex is signature biodynamic driver's
and a very well reviewed sound signature
they come with a removable cable a
carrying pouch and a two-year warranty
and you can check them out on mass drop
at the link below so thanks for watching
guys if you disliked this video you can
hit that button he'll if you just like
RGB lighting you can hit that button but
if you liked the video hit the like
