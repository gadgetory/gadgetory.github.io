because well if we're being honest they
have really changed much lately other
than some tempered glass here and some
RGB there but that's not the case with
this one this is the Silverstone mammoth
mm oh one a spectacularly heavy black
monstrosity whose claim to fame it's
been really difficult to open the box up
is being bust proof and splash proof
some things are about to get wet
literally we're gonna spray water on a
system in this case with an extreme
edition processor running inside it but
you know what we're not gonna spray
water on Brandon because he deserves
better than that even if he did bung up
the audio settings the first time we
shot this
Corsairs obsidian 500d mid-tower gaming
case features premium tempered glass and
aluminum construction removable top fan
trays and more check it out at the link
below this thing actually launched all
the way back in 2015 completely flying
under my radar
due to its unprecedented level of
neatness so you could think of the
mammoth as kind of like the off-road
edition of what would normally be a
computer case like designed for use in
rough conditions oh you know it's
actually not that crazy big but it's
really heavy oh my gosh that's pretty
brutal it is kind of got a plane sort of
look to it
there's no tempered glass that's pretty
nice that's magnetic yeah the exterior
is about as plain black box as you can
get it sports a brushed steel finish but
in the age of tempered glass windows
you'd be forgiven for thinking it's a
little boring but if you look a little
closer the entire top of the case is
completely filled right so no IO or fan
holes whatsoever up here to keep water
from getting in presumably and check out
these so this is cool these front
louvers are not an aesthetic feature
instead they actually serve to prevent
fluids again from getting to the
internal components of the PC and
flipping it around to the back you can
see it has the same louvers here with a
notch at the bottom check that out to
allow you to get cables to the rear i/o
the design of the mammoth gives it an
impressive IP 43 rating meaning it's
safe from not just drips like if you
were to spill a cup of water onto the
table next to it but even water sprays
now I wouldn't recommend pressure
washing your computer and gaming at the
same time but if you left a window open
with the sprinkler running
your computer should be okay it's just
the rest of the room I'd be concerned
about let's crack it open
yeah here we find the MMO one second
party trick a full fat 20 millimeter
thick HEPA filter now most fan filters
are pretty good at mitigating dust
buildup over the short term but a filter
like this is SPECT to remove 99.97% of
particles larger than 0.3 microns that's
smaller than all but the smallest
bacteria so I guess you won't have to
worry about your PC getting the flu
obviously compared to a regular filter
this one's gonna be a little more
restrictive right but it looks like
Silverstone thought of that because they
not only have to push air through one
just like that but also the HEPA filter
and the solution these babies to massive
180 millimeter air penetrator fans at
max speed which you can control with
these knobs at the front these move a
whopping 340 CFM of air about the same
as a typical pedestal fan at medium
pretty darn impressive then to top it
off there's actually space to install a
rear 120 millimeter fan as well so while
Jake builds up a high-end system for our
tests let's get a little bit of
preparation done
okay it's done you want to see yeah
let's have a look alright so there are a
few things that stand out a lot of cases
these days are basically just the
standard layout with a different bezel
on the front not so here so first of all
the layout is inverted so the CPU is on
the bottom and the GPU is on top second
our power supply actually takes a page
out of 2006's book and is up on the top
but still with no ventilation that's
because the whole top was sealed to keep
water from getting in so the power
supply actually has to suck air from the
inside then blow it out the back
fortunately these fans that we showed
you guys at the front should keep it
well supplied with fresh air all take a
moment here to show you guys this here
CPU heatsink support thing so there's
actually wonderful at the graphics card
and the CPU which if you think about the
applications in this case on let's say
something like a boat makes a ton of
sense cuz if this pcs are rocking you
don't want your heatsink going and
knocking about on the inside because of
the design of the filtering system
nearly 40% of the space inside the case
is taken up by the filter in the front
and the buffer in the rear to prevent
water from entering the system it does
limit your cooling options but even with
the relatively limited space the MMO one
can still fit for dual slot graphics
cards and easily houses up to an SSI EEE
be dual socket motherboard if you're
willing to limit your storage expansion
to two three and a half inch drives so
this is all good in theory but we want
see what kind of thermals we might
expect with a high-end system in this
case so you want to throw the panel on
there and I'll get a stress test fire it
up here it's actually kind of amazing
how much air these fans move through
that HEPA filter yeah I mean they are a
max speed rather than leave it at these
settings though like this is quite loud
I want to go with not minimum but quiet
enough that it probably wouldn't bother
anyone that seems pretty good and we're
still getting like quite a bit of
airflow back here let's give it some
time to heat up yeah
okay so these are not bad results
actually GPU is tearing up to 17 80 or
so at its 82 degree maximum and our CPU
has only two cores about sixty degrees
three not too shabby
yeah I mean there's an NHD 15 in there
so CPU temperatures are probably
expected are you ready to run it through
the gauntlet yeah let's do it all right
so we're here we're gonna do the
gauntlet lioness is a little busy with
another video and I definitely am NOT
doing this for the second time no this
has never done this test before oh this
looks Turner on get these fans to chin
so there might be a little bit of dust
in there but I kind of have an idea of
how much was in there beforehand just
like throw a little dust on there here
nice and not nice I guess I don't know I
really hope we don't have to do this
again because I do not have any dust
left all right so there's actually quite
a bit of dust up here I'm not really
sure how that got in there okay so let's
let's turn it off this time and see
what's going on inside I think for the
most part it's gonna be pretty decent
but I imagine there's going to be some
leakage all right
so that is a little more dust than was
in there before so I don't think this
system is perfect but it actually held
up pretty good regular computer dust is
not gonna be an issue for this thing
maybe don't throw sawdust at it or use
it in your woodshop
okay so let's see how the filters doing
oh no that's gross oh so the attacked
side is pretty disgusting but when we
flip it over
pretty damn clean so it looks like a
little bit of dust got in but I imagine
it's probably just from the cracks
around
I don't think dust that big would get
through a filter like this and then on
this side pretty dirty here as well
alright let's get to the water oh my god
you think I should spray with a hose - I
think we should spray it with those
alright I should probably turn it on
before we spray it with the hose is it
on Oh
I really hope this survives my test
bench actually it would be really
inconvenient if this died I'd be kind of
upset to be honest there's a little
water in there but for the most part it
looks like it's dry Wow Wow
completely dry inside sure there's a
little water around the edges but inside
the computer there's no moisture I think
we should probably test this before I
bring Linus over you know just in case
it doesn't work display for this monitor
even plugged in oh my gosh oh yeah it
works okay let's let's get Linus and
show them the carnage so to be honest I
already opened it there is a little bit
of dust in there no water no water I
sprayed this thing down good this side
is a little beat-up yeah I see that Wow
but it caught it yeah so yeah there's a
little bit of dust on the panel there
and you can see some of the chunks did
make it through but I mean compared to
what you'd see in a normal case that is
really impressive I think my dust abuse
is a little out of the ordinary as well
yeah no I mean this is obviously a
torture test but you can see even where
the water did manage to penetrate the
design doesn't allow it to go any
further than this yeah there's a little
splash shield here too oh so
it doesn't have the greatest cooling
characteristics out of any case we've
ever tried but it's utterly unique in
its dust and water resistant design
making it at what is it three hundred
bucks basically a no-brainer if you need
a dust and water resistant PC case
