entered in the Intel dynamic ticket
giveaway for a chance to win great
prizes is it Intel gaming promo com
to learn more welcome to my unboxing and
overview of a couple of different
products from a data so these are both
numbers of their xpg line and I wanted
to treat this video not just as another
Ram unboxing because let's face it I've
done enough of those over the years it's
ran it goes in your motherboard more is
more better usually anyway the point of
all of this is why would you want
different types of memory so in front of
me with the easy open packaging which
I'm still working on here got my easy
open packaging there we go
that was easy alright I have two very
very different options that represent a
lot of different different aspects of
the memory purchasing process so right
here I have some more basic low-profile
xpg modules these ones are a 16 gig kit
so it's a 2 by 8 gig kit that means it's
optimized for dual channel operation on
whether it's an Intel z77 or z87
platform or an AMD platform so dual
channel optimized number two is it's a
high capacity kit so that's high density
memory modules that usually means you're
going to get well more capacity which is
great for things like video editing or
rendering particularly for like sort of
light consumer or prosumer or grade
stuff because this isn't like ECC
registered or like workstation grade or
anything like that so it's gonna be
useful for applications where you need
lots of RAM but higher density modules
tend not to be available at the same
kinds of speeds as lower density modules
so latency is usually a trade-off so
that's that that's that CL and then the
series of timings after it is usually a
trade-off with the frequency that it
runs at so if this runs at 1866 CL 10
you can usually assume that Authority
equivalent in terms of performance to
1600 CL 9 or something along those lines
but it depends on whether the
application likes more bandwidth or like
slower and latency and that's something
that you definitely want to shop for
when you
looking at memory these modules are also
low profile which can offer better
compatibility with different coolers
that can overhang the memory slots so
there you go that's the summary of these
xpg modules right here 1866 8 gig dims
low profile and high density all right
now let's move on to these xpg modules
so these are more about the flashiness
so we've got black PCBs high profile
spreaders that in theory will offer
slightly better heat dissipation but in
practice it doesn't really make that
much of a difference it does reduce
compatibility with larger air coolers
that overhang the memory slots from time
to time although the heatsink
manufacturers are working on making this
less of an issue but of course if you're
running water cooling for example then
that won't be a problem and these ones
right here run at very high frequencies
so these are 2.4 gigahertz memory
modules at a caste latency of only 11 so
the timings are not that much looser
than that 1866 kit making these pretty
pricey hot pretty pricey memory modules
now with all of that said for the
performance difference between the
lowest end memory and the highest end
memory is not that much for some people
and unless you're into the tuning and
tweaking aspect you might not find it
worthwhile to spend a ton of money on
very expensive memory although we're
gonna have a follow-up video coming
where we take this 20 400 megahertz
memory run it at a bunch of different
speeds particularly in gaming
applications and find out exactly how
much of a difference it makes because
right now I can't quantify it but
that'll be coming soon it definitely
looks better especially if you color
match with your motherboard in this case
we've got a Suzy eighty-seven deluxe
that I think it happens to look
particularly ravishing in and I think
that pretty much covers it so the main
things you're looking for guys are is it
optimized for the right number of
channels for your system what capacity
do you need what speed you need it to
run at and make sure you check those
latency timings because the higher they
are the more it might negate any benefit
you're getting from the higher clock
speed of your memory and it can be quite
difficult for your CPU to run very high
clock speed memory particularly on last
generation Intel platforms such as Ivy
Bridge or even on has wall when you're
running
at very high CPU frequencies don't
