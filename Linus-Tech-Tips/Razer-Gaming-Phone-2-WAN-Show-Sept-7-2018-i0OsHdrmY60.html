only only green lights OBS is telling me
that it disconnected and reconnected and
stuff but but but I think we're good to
go welcome to the wine show it's just me
this week all of LMG as you might recall
I'm not technically part of LMG anymore
all of LMG is off on this work ation
thing in Banff if you want to look that
up look that up if you want to look that
up a lot of us Canadians say Banff which
sounds like it has an M in it but it's
actually an N so it's a ba n o FF it's
an absolutely beautiful place a bunch of
them are uploading pictures to their
instagrams and their Twitter's and
whatnot so check that out it's super
cool but again it is just me this week
so this is the wine show we've got some
some topics I guess technically there's
a new AMD Zen and Radeon Vega CPU for
just 55 bucks sounds super cool but
we'll talk about that later Microsoft is
going to continue support for Windows 7
if you pay them there's a second razor
phone that has been confirmed and and
there's some some other cool news like
leaked benchmarks showing off 9700 K
some steam news some AT&amp;amp;T news some EA
news of follow up of the Jacksonville
shooting tons of random stuff so yeah
stay tuned intro boom it worked what up
cameras lately focus rip don't think I
can fix it I might just be leaning too
much or something I'll try to fix it
launcher slides or not what now
audience you didn't see that coming you
try to guess everything like all the way
and show it's gonna be late again and
you're right by like three minutes but
you you didn't guess that did you know
sponsor slides what now
let's go okay first topic let's talk
about AMD and let's talk about Vega and
let's talk about Zen and let's talk
about Radeon there's a new CPU like I
said earlier for fifty five bucks now I
do want to say I'm gonna jump into the
AMD's website here for a second
I guess you guys gonna see twitch out on
screen because I want to be able to see
you there you are oh boy this isn't a
lot of people didn't like oh my god yeah
someone finally cares about the the
low-end scene and that's not necessarily
true intel does have processors that are
around the $50 range as well and that
are two core for thread processors like
this one is what I will say is that Vega
on a CPU is pretty neato and they're
claiming that you should be able to do
eSports games that's becoming a little
bit broader of a statement these days so
I'm not a hundred central how confident
in that I am but it says eSports game
high-definition 720p which is actually
not bad especially for someone who wants
to like just tip their dip their toe
into gaming if you can do that without
buying a graphics card you can is it
okay is everything fine it looks like
everything fine there's some people in
the comments trying to try to troll me
but I'm just gonna keep moving anyways
it's it's it's gonna be nice to be able
to play what I'm assuming is like
counter-strike League of Legends kind of
stuff I don't think we're gonna be
hitting near the ranges of stuff like
overwatch which is very very much in the
in the eSports range these days and then
there's other companies that try to
claim they're like good the positive of
eSports titles like pub G and that's
just weird and I don't know what eSport
the category of eSports games even
necessarily means anymore before it was
like Starcraft 2 League of Legends
strike and some others that were around
the similar difficulty to run and and
now it's uh now it's changed a little
bit let me know what you guys think in
the twitch chat which I'm gonna be
watching all stream because I don't
exactly have anyone else to host with me
let me know what you guys think is the
hardest to run proper eSports title and
if you think it could run on this new
AMD Zen and Raiden Radeon Vega CPU for
$55 because you could get a really
really cheat I don't know if you guys
watch the last season of scrapyard works
that was an older AMD chip with graphics
on it but in a 10 couldn't really run
fortnight reasonably but that wasn't at
720p we were doing that I believe at
1080 so I don't know Microsoft
continuing to support Windows 7 if you
can pay although Windows 7 extended
support is scheduled to go through
January of 2020 this new paid for
support I believe should go through 2023
yeah yeah 2023 we don't have a specific
month you will have to pay an additional
fee for the security patches and it will
be just security patches there's no
details yet on pricing this news comes
from the register by the way that first
topic was posted by the Benjamins
thank you very much the Benjamin's on
the forum this one I don't think was
posted by anyone in particular
oh there's actually a kick uber article
let me jump over there real quick
dududu someone saying Luke is feeling
better nope still sick just putting it
on for an hour we're good
here we go Microsoft yeah like I said
Microsoft adds another three years of
security buh-buh-buh-buh-buh this is
going to be great for actually quite a
few people because if I remember
correctly Windows 7 is about 40 percent
of current operating system installs
right now I don't know if that's all
operating systems on PCs that's
obviously not for phones but I don't
know if that's all operating systems for
PCs or if that's all operating systems
that are Windows but it's about 40
percent of windows installs which is
which is a lot I'm personally a windows
8.1 or
I like Windows 8.1 even though my
percentage of people is very very very
small I actually I like that operating
system because I can play all the games
on it not most of them which I guess
Linux now has which is quite cool and I
can do the vast majority of my work on
it which is which is cool but yeah it's
it's gonna be interesting interesting to
see how much it cost because I don't
know if this is going to be a someone's
like WTF Windows 8.1 yeah it's it's
actually not that bad people are saying
its Terra bad I doubt you've used it I
don't you've used it for an extended
period of time it has quite good
compatibility and it doesn't have the
yeah like it has quite good
compatibility which is better than
Windows 7 but then it's not Windows 10
which is which is quite nice you can all
bicker about it while you haven't used
it for extended periods of time that's
fine anyways Microsoft will continue
support of Windows 7 don't know if this
is a consumer thing or a commercial
thing it might be vastly out of the
price range of most consumers and it
might just be more for like airports and
enterprise stuff because we often find
that those industries like to not
upgraded their operating systems pretty
much ever and will often pay for
extended support so that might be the
situation that we're having here because
we've had that situation before and they
might just be prepping people beforehand
that it will be possible because I think
it was always and like after the point
kind of situation before I bet you there
will still be some groups very major
companies that will have to go into
another extended term after 2023 but
we'll have to see when that happens Wow
we are 10 minutes in and I'm slamming
through topics that's one of the
problems when you only have one host
there's no like back and forth
conversation so things just go real
quick I didn't really see Cera's more
focus in me could I do this then does
that make it better are you gonna stop
stop crying now that might that might
fix it Dennis Dennis Dennis Dennis is
off in Banff I talked about this when I
first launched the show but I think I
saw it earlier today he was on a bike
ride I don't necessarily know what he's
doing right now
ah I just want to see in the comments if
anyone mentioned any of those eSports
games I was talking about I didn't
really see any everyone just got so
fixated on me and Windows 8.1 it's not
the first time I've mentioned on the
windchill when his fist is greater than
oh don't forget the sponsors today we do
have two sponsors but they're not
they're not your normal kind of sponsors
they're affiliate sponsors and I don't
have banners for them so I had nothing
to put up in the intro and I will have
nothing to put up when I talk about them
later but yeah no no it's Humble Bundle
and p IA I believe but well we'll talk
about them later okay next topic is and
this one confuses me a little bit but
let's talk about it the second raiser
phone has been confirmed there was a
what is it called is it even in these
notes yes there was a financial report
which is often where we find these types
of leaks stating that Razer will be
launching a razor phone to or whatever
you end up calling it
they have been slashing prices on the
first gen phone probably trying to get
some of that inventory out the phone
should be relatively powerful like the
first gen phone it will have eight gigs
of ram so the first razor phone had
eight gigs of ram the SOC or
system-on-a-chip
is getting an upgrade to the flagship
snapdragon 845 from Qualcomm and it'll
go from four cores to eight which is
actually pretty major the phone appeared
on Geekbench with a single score of 2026
and a multi-core score of 82 34 better
than the first gen model but not as high
as flagships such as the iPhone X and
the Samsung s9 there may be more up
apparently there may be more gamer
centric features such as a fast display
that may help to appeal to a more gamer
centric target audience this is where my
question for you guys
lands I know the gamer section as a
whole console and PC are able to come
together on the one idea
mobile gamers aren't gamers but I have a
legitimate question and I need I need
some help on this
avoid let's avoid the saltiness for a
moment I legitimately don't know is
there any mobile games that will
actually benefit from 120 Hertz screen I
really don't know because the only
mobile games that I've ever really even
seen are like you is either Pokemon go
where you like swirl around and then
just throw the thing and then everything
else happens kind of automatically and
you definitely don't need 120 Hertz
screen for that or it's like clicker
simulators where it's like oh you've
waited 16 hours press that button now
and then press that button and then wait
16 hours again or pay some money and
have it accelerated I don't know a
fortnight sort of forgot about that
okay so it's basically for fortnight in
pub G I guess that's pretty much it
VR okay the are on mobile really sucks
but whatever okay that's a good point
and 120 Hertz screens becoming common
for mobile will help push VR forward
someone's like uncanny crush oh my
goodness okay so it's probably mostly
fortnight pub G and P ARS a really small
section but sure we are people saying
prawn I don't know if anyone's into 120
Hertz on that they might be I don't know
it does that is a very technologically
pushing sector of the market that is
absolutely true that that is a thing
they horn pushes the market like crazy
but I don't I don't I don't think
there's a huge market for 120 Hertz
phones just for that I could be super
wrong I don't know I'm just saying
speaking of what I was just talking
about steam is adding filters to hide
certain games in search you guys might
have known a while ago we talked on the
LAN show about steam day
they blocked some game and then that
started this huge conversation about
what stuff should be or should not be
allowed on Steam and I think that pushed
steam to eventually say that they would
pretty much allow everything that wasn't
illegal I think that was their official
ending statement but they would not be
obligated to promote such things and I
think they're going more in that
direction by allowing people to have
filters and I'm assuming there's going
to be some form of default filters that
you would have to uncheck this would
allow controversial titles to be on the
platform such as adult games but make it
so they don't automatically get promoted
to everybody users also have flexibility
to hide things they don't want in
general so if you didn't want like
racing games you could use the same
filter to filter out those games which
would be cool
I personally like racing games I'm just
saying I'm just saying users now will be
able to list ten tags up from three
apparently you're already able to do
three of things that they do not want to
see gamers now have the choice of
omitting certain developers and
publishers specifically so if you have
like a boycott against a specific
publisher sorry EA is not on Steam you
would be able to block them out
completely as well as including mature
content adults only kind of games the
former will exclude games where the
publisher hasn't told steam exactly what
that mature content is because I I guess
there's categories for that too
but I'm assuming that's more for a
search reason I don't know the idea is
to balance keeping steam an open
platform where a lot of different people
can use it and it doesn't feel weird and
you can actually have your like Steam
store up on your desktop without like
worrying if your mom's gonna be able to
see it but also be able to have all
these games that people apparently want
on Steam yeah what do you guys think
about this solution I think it's a
relatively good solution I don't care
about those kinds of games so I'll just
leave the filter on I guess so that
those types of games are blocked
literally just so that they don't
clutter up the store because I actually
do use the steam store to like search
for new
games every once awhile I'll filter
through try to find something that finds
seems interesting and then look for
reviews online so if I can remove
certain things I actually really like
the publisher feature because there's
certain game publishers even if I have
nothing against them I just already know
that I don't like their type of games so
if I can just block them out that seems
that seems great so far twitch chat
seems to be agreeing with me
someone said an ok solution about as
good as you could get yeah I could see
that countryroads
I don't I don't think imagine you could
block country roads and that it just
only blocked fallout 76 and all the DLC
that would be oh yeah I'll be pretty
great moving on to the next topic
British Airways suffers a huge data
breach apparently an unknown attacker
carried out a sophisticated breach of
British Airways security the hacker
exposed three hundred and eighty
thousand transactions and compromised
customers financial information though
not their travel plans okay I mean
that's still bad but it's actually not
as bad their CEO has promised to
compensate anyone who suffers financial
loss due to the hack customers affected
have already been notified by British
Airways and British Airways even took
out a newspaper ad apologizing okay
funnily enough British Airways was in
talks with IBM to outsource their
security briefly before the cyberattack
perhaps to cut costs they seemed to be
responding to this in in the best way
they probably could to be completely
honest having the CEO just kind of
automatically come out and say hey we're
gonna cover any of the costs that that
happened from this having people's
travel information not be leaked it is
huge because that would be a problem for
a huge number of reasons take him to a
newspaper ad just to make sure like
everybody knows yeah I don't know I mean
it's not a great thing that had happened
but this day and age like practically
everyone gets hacked you guys should
check out have I been poned calm let me
see if I can go there right now
Denton and today
being pwned dot-com yeah there we go
have I been partly you can't see it cuz
my kid yeah there have I been poned
really cool website covers a whole bunch
of different data breaches
I don't think technically all of them
but like a huge amount and it's
interesting because you can see under
down here largest breaches you can see
all the largest of myspace accounts from
back in the day heck yeah
pwned accounts five billion three
hundred and seventy 1 million nine
hundred thirteen thousand six hundred
and twenty five this happens a lot a lot
of different websites a lot of different
companies get rekt and end up leaking
data it's the thing that happens you
should be securing your own stuff I'm
gonna promote using some form of
password manager and there is a range of
different ways a range of different
services that you can use for password
management and you can go with like
super hardcore kind of really annoying
to use but incredibly secure options all
the way up to still way more secure than
what you're probably doing right now not
necessarily because I'm sure this
audience especially has quite a few
people in it that are properly taking
care of their passwords but still
probably better than what you're doing
right now like it just the standard
password manager and then you can also
look into other ways of securing that
password manager with 2fa with physical
authentication with a bunch of other
types of things and that will make it so
that it's easier to have a different
password for every single website and
service you use so that when you do I'm
gonna say win if when you do get pwned
by a website's user accounts or whatever
getting leaked you don't have all of
your accounts get wrecked it's like just
that singular one I would highly highly
recommend doing so yeah it will help you
in these situations because it's it's
it's more or less inevitable like
there's there's a wild amount of
services that have their information
stolen and it's going to happen
eventually and I would honestly there's
even
ease-of-use argument once you get a
password manager set up it's not you
don't have to remember so many things
anymore you have to remember like your
master password for that password
manager I would also recommend having
your email not in that password manager
and remembering that password as well so
you have like two passwords that you
need to remember and that's pretty much
it that's not bad that's this that's
pretty simple also just for those master
passwords you can watch there's there's
a great xkcd on making a strong password
and we also have I believe a last active
SEPA sewed and a tech quickie episode
about making stronger passwords so check
those out and and secure your own stuff
man because while these companies should
keep their things secure it's still
gonna happen eventually so don't don't
trust anyone secure your own stuff there
you go there's also leaked benchmarks of
the i7 9700 k if we want to get back to
to tech topics we have this from hexxus
dotnet I haven't actually seen the chart
load up on my screen yet and there we go
I can tell you definitely faster there
we go oh this is like not the easiest to
read thing ever but bump what is this
this should be the previous one system
manufacturer system product name great
there that's an 8700 K and then this
should be a 97 okay yeah so we're
looking at single core performance of
the 8700 K at six thousand and twelve
single core performance of the 9700 K at
six thousand two hundred ninety seven
multi core performance of the 8700 K at
twenty seven 463 and multi core
performance of the 9700 K had 30,000 152
so I mean it's a step up intel is still
kind of ruling the single core
performance realm but dx12 Vulcan being
a big deal just gonna switch back here
dx12 volcán being a really big deal
processors generally having a lot more
threads these days and cores for sure
but threads these days is going to
slowly promote promote slowly promote
more multi-core utilization as we move
forward and actually make multi-core
utilization better and more beneficial
as we move forward if you haven't
watched my DX 2 what what the heck is
the x12 in Vulcan video I would highly
recommend you do so in general just
because it's one of my favorite videos
but it also covers how multi-core is
used there's certain things even with
the x12 in volcán that are gonna have to
stay on core 1 but DX 12 invoked in help
or thread 1 or whatever but DX 12 invoke
can help spread out the load in general
onto other course and and enable that to
happen so it's good it's good right now
Intel still kind of winning the game and
the single core performance but but
there's a lot of things going in AMD's
favor right now so so don't don't feel
too bad if you're an AMD fan
everything's everything's kind of good
for everybody right now the CPU space is
quite strong at the moment it has been
stronger in the past but it's great that
we at least have a very strong
competitor of these days also AT&amp;amp;T
offers first-responders unlimited data
but there is a catch I don't necessarily
know why this is an article on the LAN
show to be completely honest my only
reason why I'm saying that is they're
just doing the same annoying crap that
basically every other ISP is doing we've
been hearing about this a fair amount
lately when there's a disaster everyone
gets on two connected resources a lot of
people are trying to it's called
FaceTime I call I don't know I don't
know Apple stuff but video call other
people on iPhones I believe it's called
FaceTime I'm trolling I know what it is
or trying to Facebook call or do other
various video calls on Android or
whatever else because they're trying to
talk to their friends and family because
they don't know if they're gonna get
rekt by whatever
disaster so AT&amp;amp;T is saying hey first
responders can have unlimited data but
there's a catch you're on the same
backbone as everyone else we're not
gonna prioritize your stuff so you're
still going to get throttled so it
doesn't really help ultimately that's a
huge problem they need a different they
needed a different back-end apparently
they actually have one if local police
fire or EMS emergency medical services
department doesn't you so sorry no I
skipped my notes a little bit oh it just
jumps right into that anyways there's
something called firstnet the US
government contracted I believe it was
AT&amp;amp;T to make firstnet and that is
supposed to save them from this I don't
know if it's like way more expensive or
something if you want to subscribe to it
but they are not theoretically subject
to throttling on firstnet and that's
exactly what happened with Verizon this
this like a few months ago I think are
two months ago or something where
there's that fire department that got
super throttled is they're saying well
they weren't on firstnet which is
supposedly the the issue but I guess
this is kind of nice the AT&amp;amp;T first
responders unlimited data plan has 25
percent off so that that's that's cool
doesn't save you if your data is being
throttled and you're a first responder
trying to get information back and forth
during a disaster but saves you a couple
bucks every month so that's a a plus for
effort AT&amp;amp;T anyways EA is being sued
nope we're gonna talk about sponsors get
wrecked everyone the first sponsor is
private area access and I don't have a
banner for this but I kind of want to
can I do this yeah okay I'm just gonna
remove the banner in its entirety
so what everyone knows that this is not
like a normal section of the show this
is the sponsor section of the show why
this is gonna join us real quick that's
not it focus at all is it whatever Lance
is gonna join us for a second so private
Internet access private Internet access
as you guys know is av
P n we've talked about a ton on the show
I'm sure you guys have heard about it in
general but we have a partnership with
them in ways I guess the business guys
are going to hate me because I don't
know the correct term for this affiliate
we haven't affiliate with them they have
a great VPN it works for tons of
different stuff like Windows Mac OS
Android iOS Linux Google Chrome
specifically if you don't want to have
it on your whole computer and you want
the ease of use of it just activating in
your browser with support for several
other platforms coming soon so like
practically freaking everything and even
more stuff later on you can connect up
to five devices at the same time under
one plan with private Internet access
and it has an internet kill switch this
part I think is quite important and is
actually really cool the internet kill
switch will block all traffic will
essentially temporarily cut off your
internet if the VPN becomes disconnected
unexpectedly
the reason for that is if you're
currently using your internet and you
are expecting to be protected by a VPN
and then the VPN turns off and you keep
broadcasting you just compromised
everything and it was completely useless
so that is actually very important that
is a very important feature a lot of
people overlook check it out today the
link is in the description if you're on
twitch yeah I don't know if you want to
type this in it's private internet
private Internet access com / pages / -

and I can't copy and paste that into
twitch chat and I don't have a lower
banner for you so good luck I believe in
you
I absolutely believe you can make it put
it in the chat I can't I'm not logged in
to twitch my bad going back up I'm
running away now okay
leaked bench mine oh I already did that
118 already did that one ei being sued
by victim of Jacksonville Madden
tournament shooting I think we all
probably saw this coming
I wonder what you guys do you think
about it and I want to hear from you in
twitch chat and on the comments on
YouTube because I think this will be a
relatively controversial topic I'm gonna
more or less keep my opinions out of it
but I'm interested what the community
thinks after I'm sure you guys have
heard about the Jacksonville shooting at
the Madden tournament I didn't know
Madden had in-person tournaments but sad
very sad regardless after a shooting
that left two dead at a Madden NFL
tournament in Jacksonville Florida
the
other week some some time ago one
survivor is being sued by EA the
producer of the game his theory of the
case is that I should put this back
group there we go
is that EA who sponsored the tournament
make negligently did not pick a safe
venue or provide adequate security it's
unclear how much the plaintiff is
seeking in monetary damages and EA has
already promised to donate $1,000,000 to
the victims the lawsuit notes that the
area around the venue has suffered from
other shootings as well as stabbings in
recent years but seeing as the shooter
was a Madden player from out of town not
from Jacksonville Florida it will be
interesting to see if that argument
holds any water in in court the shopping
mall and the restaurant where the
shooting took place are also being named
as defendants it's a relatively broad
case it's gonna be it's gonna be really
interesting I don't really super want to
go into it but it's gonna be very
interesting to see what the community
thinks about this I know there are a lot
of different opinions on security
especially these days and because it was
a shooting it involved a firearm which
means there's like even more aggressive
opinions on that so it's it's it's gonna
be interesting to see what you guys have
to say so yeah comment in twitch comment
on YouTube
try not to rip each other apart too much
just have a sit have a civil discussion
about crazy things that suck how about
that what didn't mean to play that intro
sorry about that
let me go back to the dock and scroll
through here for a second Frye's a'
fries oh whoa that actually sounds kind
of cool but I just combined Forza or
forts ax is it Forza or fourths ax I
hear both I'm gonna go with forza forza
horizon for specs have been announced it
is a racing game i know this is the
second time i mention racing games of
this stream racing games are not
generally as hard on your system as
other games which is cool because you
kind of want really high refresh rates
and you want really really really
cranked graphics because it can look
absolutely beautiful some of the best
looking games and really not crazy hard
to run which is great it has been
anticipated for a while a lot of people
have been knowing that it's on the way
but the recommended specs are out
although for 1080p60 microsoft
recommends a gtx if you're on the gtx
side of the game you're looking at like
a 970 or 1060 about or if you're on the
other side you're looking at like a 290x
or 470 which really isn't too bad 970 sr
like 4 years old now somewhere around
there it's been a little while and 10
60's are now not quite but soon to being
replaced we're assuming 2000 series
graphics cards are gonna have a 60
eventually so it's it's kind of on the
way so the prices shouldn't be too bad
for those cards and that's 1080p 60 you
get 60fps which again important for a
racing game in my opinion however if you
do have something as low as a GT 740
which you like probably shouldn't have
because you should have bought just a
retro car but that's on the line you
might get a good deal on one of those if
it's a 720 you should definitely not buy
it but anyways if you have something as
low as a GT 740 you will be able to play
the game at 720p you'll be able to play
the game it won't be the best experience
ever but you will be able to play the
game the requirements which is spelt as
respire mints in the dock the
requirements are more or less the same
as horizon 3 so this shouldn't be way
too surprising despite the fact that
there were some noticeable graphical
improvements when the game was shown as
III although as we all probably know
here that means more or less nothing I
don't necessarily know if Microsoft has
been caught showing like way better
footage at e3 than the game comes out as
but we've had that happen like a lot so
ya don't know how much I would read into
that but it is a next generation of the
game so I'm assuming it will look it
will look a bit better and will be
interesting to see if they have some of
that new tech
coming out like I wonder if if you do
have one of the new 2000 series cards a
racing game with rate racing would look
great I'm just saying that be that would
be quite fantastic and this becomes
immediately awkward because there's
about 23 minutes left in the show and
and I don't have any more topics I have
an idea though if you guys want to hang
with me for a second the Linus tech tips
forum in the tech news section which is
very very close to a million posts can
probably save me once again right I
don't know why this was oh no I dunno
either so it wasn't in the dock but this
is actually totally okay AMD 7 nanometre
GPUs have been confirmed for 2018 I am
gonna put a little slight warning here
is that the confirmation of these cards
may not be for gamers necessarily I kind
of suspect at the very least the first
wave of these things is going to be for
the not gaming community so don't get
too hyped but any GPUs on the 7
nanometer process will mean that will
eventually come to gamers so this is
exciting kind of regardless in the end
so don't worry don't worry about it
don't worry about it too much
people want floatplane news I how about
this I'll do that next and there is
actually some interesting flow play news
finally it's been a little while this
this might not be the best news for
NVIDIA as you might guess amongst the
2000 series hype once it died down a
little bit not even that much just a
little bit and you dropped this little
news nugget hoping to as far as I can
tell grab a little bit of that hype and
pull the conversation back to them which
is a good idea
Nvidia seems to be going in a direction
of almost removing some of the
tangibility of differences between cards
by adding the AI cores and moving to
things like ray tracing technologies and
other things that RT X is gonna be able
to do in
general like moving anti-aliasing in
some games if they're done the right way
to the AI course to free up the cuda
cores for other things but all this kind
of stuff and AMD's going like even
smaller process brah so it's gonna be an
interesting fight in the next couple of
years and with Intel talking about
tossing their hat in the ring as well
graphics is gonna be it's gonna be fun
for a little while so that's exciting
because honestly for quite a few years
their graphics and CPU were just like
kind of dead and boring and it was
basically more or less one team on each
side and now we're splitting back and
it's so it's been good so speaking of
which floatplane news I don't have a
banner for this what if I just like sit
on the blue side more I guess that
doesn't really make any sense because
that's the wrong blue that's closer to
like in is that closer to an Intel blue
maybe that's probably the reason why
they did this flew in red then we need a
green um full plain blue is lighter but
anyways full plane is getting a bunch of
new stuff pretty soon I know I know
well so you probably don't even care but
it's interesting to me we have a new
payment system coming the reason why we
haven't been talking a ton about
floatplane lately is because we've
wanted to get this new payment system
out because the current payment system
is kind of a drag to use and we're
refactoring the entire thing and that
should be out next week I've been saying
that for a month and a half but I
believe it this time
wholeheartedly I think it's going to be
out next week so that's actually quite
exciting because that should be good for
everybody people who are currently
subscribed people are going to subscribe
in the future that should be good for
everyone
and with that payment system coming out
that will free AJ up to push a bunch of
things into prod that have been ready
for a while now but have not been the
priority over getting payments working
like discord so you will be able to have
your floatplane account and get
authenticated on the Linus tech tips
discord with your flow plan again this
is not a there's not a feature this is
not a feature yet but it's coming
it's the code is like done it's just not
in prod okay just about the ba ba ba ba
ba don't try to do this now you'll be
able to link your flow playing duck
we count two discord get discord access
rights in the LTTE discord and anyone
else's discord that decides to do this
meaning right now tech deals and bit wit
and anyone else that joins the platform
will be able to have their own discord
floatplane bot which can give access to
people and be used as a notification
system speaking of notifications native
through the website notifications are
finally coming so you'll actually be
able to get notified through mobile and
if you want if you sign up for it email
alerts for new videos to people that you
are subscribed to which is also great
also the chat for streaming will be
fixed so I don't know if you heard us
talking about it but we're gonna be
streaming the wine show through
floatplane that's all done as well again
it's not it's not an it's not in prod
don't it's not yet but the code is done
it just hasn't been pushed into prod so
we'll be able to stream the wine show
and any other Creators on flow plane
will be able to stream through full
plane as well
fun stuff there's also a bunch of
front-end improvements coming and some
other great stuff that doesn't
necessarily affect you guys all that
much but yeah there's gonna be really
really cool things for flip plane in a
little while someone in chat says Rando
question but will you guys ever do a
online scrapyard war it's like eBay or
Amazon maybe with a rushed custom design
segment I seriously doubt it the most
boring part of any scrapyard wars is
when Linus and I sit down and go okay
the competition started I'm super
excited and they offered up time for me
to sit here on my laptop and type away
just tappy tappy tap and send a bunch of
emails that is like definitely the most
boring part of any scrapyard wars ever
so we'll probably stay away from that
but you know it's coming
so what I'm hearing is all these changes
have been fully implemented and we need
to know stuff none of them were
implemented this Jill they're coming
though they're on the way and I'm quite
excited about that I had something else
I was going to talk about but I don't
remember now I was gonna move on to the
next next topic that's the magic of
video editing yeah video editing an
entirely online contest doesn't really
give you a lot to to edit if you know
what I mean we have some cool ideas for
scapular dwarfs actually Jay and I were
talking at PAX West about a potential
scrapyard Wars idea that we kind of
started with a little nugget and then
grew it over time while we were sitting
down having dinner and it says it could
be pretty cool
could be pretty sweet I'm gonna pitch it
to Linus when he goes back it's related
to an idea that lies and I came up with
two but with Jays input I think I think
it made it even even better someone just
mentioned my stream and that reminded me
of the thing that I wanted to bring up I
do charity streams every once in a blue
moon where I play games for 24 hours
because I'm insane and then people
donate a ton of money and end up
streaming for like 30 hours but we make
a whole bunch of money for extra life
extra life which is Children's Miracle
Network Children's Miracle Hospitals
children's hospitals etc I haven't done
one in a long time because I've been
super crazy busy with like floatplane
and other stuff and my life has been
pretty hectic for a while but I'm gonna
get back to it so October 6 October 6
I'm having my first charity stream of
2018 I will be doing 24 hours of playing
games I will probably be doing my
standard charity stream setup which is
where I do like one game from each year
there might be some slight changes to
that but I'm going to do one game for an
hour and then switch which game I'm
playing and probably it will be through
the ages
so I'll start in like 1990 or maybe 1992
at this point so I got a kind
drag it forward to make it 24 hours but
play one game for one hour from that
year and then iterate the year by one
year plus one whatever and then play one
game from that year and go so on and so
forth
so yeah that's in about a month I would
love to have you there even if you don't
donate anything to extra life I'd love
to have you there regardless and while
most charities that I work with don't
don't love this line I'm gonna say if
you're a student who's just trying to
scrape by or whatever don't donate
anything don't worry about it don't
worry about it take care of yourself for
now and then once you're more
established later on then come on and
help
I usually every year we do we do quite
well my charity stream is apparently the
biggest donator group for like British
Columbia so we do pretty well with the
charity streams don't worry about it too
much but yeah come on by October 6
there'll be more details later it will
be probably starting Pacific Standard
Time noon so yeah noon midday on October
6 that's in about a month
spread the news spread the noise and
yeah I'll be doing a little probably
smaller announcements but I'll be doing
I'm honestly I'm mostly trying to burn
time right now cuz I didn't know more
topics but I'll be doing more
announcements leading up to it so I'll
try to remind you going forward so forth
forwards towards October 6 anyways I'm
gonna search for a new topic apparently
I know nothing about this apparently ei
backpedals on screwing over PC
battlefield 5 standard edition customers
this was posted by aluminum tech on the
forum and I don't actually know what was
so bad about it let's see the website
originally showed this on PC whereas the
battle royale mode was marked as
included for both console versions so if
you check out this screenshot you can
see the check marks everywhere I'm
assuming this far right column is PC the
screen
char can be a little better but it shows
that online multiplayer battle royale
online co-op and tides of war are
check-marked
everywhere and then there's a Bert a
bold a bold - just right in the middle
where I'm assuming the PC column is so
that's that's a little that's a little
rough but like the thread says they've
backpedaled on it I have not played
battlefield 5 yet if you guys are
interested I believe there is a open why
is everyone saying Skype dance
I can't scrape Dennis Dennis isn't like
the mountains right now having a
vacation I'm gonna I'm gonna leave him
alone he probably doesn't even have
network access right now and when you
know what just just let let Dennis have
his day off ok anyways yeah so the the
EA is backpedaling over battlefield 5 PC
standard edition customers I'm assuming
that means that they will now have
battle royale mode EA has updated the
battlefield 5 pre-order page which now
says that firestorm which is I'm
assuming the battle royale mode will be
part of the standard edition on pc yeah
perfect it's unclear if this change if
this is a change in policy or the
company fixed a mistake on its website
yeah so it might have had the - on
accident I
I kind of doubt a doubt that so
by accident I should say it's
technically more correct my bed but yeah
ei doing dumb stuff and hurting their
community is not even remotely
surprising so I'm gonna go with that
angle moving on I don't know if anyone
cares about this so I'm just gonna say
the title Apple's 999 pound you're no
pound British pound apples 999 British
pound iPhone X is enormous ly
underpriced
quoted by Warren Buffett I don't know if
anyone cares we're just gonna move on
Microsoft is reviving Xbox one voice
control but they're doing it using Alexa
and Cortana powered devices I also don't
know if anyone cares about this so I'm
not gonna dive into it way too hard but
again you heard it in the title they're
reviving voice control using Alexa and
Cortana power devices I didn't know
Cortana really had a bunch of devices
other than PCs I don't know but you know
that's fine dude to do right if you guys
haven't heard about this it is included
in yeah it's posted right here so gamers
access has been has been like very very
noticed for a little while right now
because of there they're like I don't
know what to call it it's not a normal
fight but they're like squabble with
Tom's Hardware it's interesting because
gamers Nexus is being very critical of
Tom's Hardware but in a way that I can
respect relatively deeply where they're
almost being like what the heck guys
this isn't you it feels like they're
like addressing their like drunk friend
and they're being like come on man you
need to you just smarten up you need to
stop drinking so much bubble blah
because they're they seem to be doing it
like out of love which is cool I've
always liked the the like tech review
community because they've always been
really cool and it's it's cool that we
can even criticize each other in
positive ways so I don't know I'm gonna
I'm gonna give them that shoutout and
I'm gonna switch to my screen for a
second this PO
was posted by Rascal on the forum but if
you heard about the the little fight
that was going on between Tom's and
gamers Nexus there was a bunch of that
happening on Twitter there was also a
video produced by gamers Nexus it was
not received super well by Tom's but
then Tom's isn't ran by Tom anymore and
Tom responded which is pretty
interesting he responded on Facebook and
then gamers Nexus made a video response
to that addressing the original response
buh-buh-buh-buh-buh the whole thing's
been very very weird I know we've talked
about our I believe we've talked about
it before on LAN show so I'm not going
to rego over everything some of the chat
said there's actually a Tom question
mark where did it go there's actually
Tom thought it was just a marketing ploy
no there is a Tom he hasn't worked for
Tom's Hardware in a while now but
interestingly enough there was actually
in his post he talks about potentially
coming back which is which is
interesting I suspect he wouldn't
necessarily even be able to come back to
to talk again there's actually two
different Tom's websites which are two
different entities I believe it's Tom's
Hardware and then Tom's Hardware de or
something I'm not super sorry I'm not on
a present up to speed on that but
there's and he might be able to come
back to like one of them or I don't I
don't I don't know but it's a it's a
developing story I find it quite
interesting and gamers Nexus is on the
forefront of that so check out their
articles and stuff because I was just at
PAX and was unable to pay full attention
to all of this all of this stuff even
though it's it's quite interesting going
back to the previous pages I don't see
this in here but what's his name
actor that plays Superman
henry cavill has apparently been
selected to to play as the get rekt for
this but the witcher he's gonna play the
witcher let me find a natural article on
this yeah henry cavill will star in
Netflix's series The Witcher here we go
OOP best known as Superman he will play
Geralt there we go that's the name I
forgot his name I was gonna rip me apart
because of that roach yeah that'd be
great if he played the horse I would
okay I'm gonna I know no one cares I'm
gonna go on this slight tangent for a
second it would actually be hilarious if
it was a super serious TV show and there
was like a proper actor playing Geralt
and then this does Henry Cavill as Roche
the horse I don't know why but I would
have absolutely oh man he's very young
for girl yeah I don't know like
obviously if you've watched shows in the
last long time it's not that hard to
make someone look believably a little
bit older I think they'll be completely
fine with that he doesn't look like
Carol I think you guys will be a little
bit surprised I think it'll be okay
TV and movies are quite wondrous these
days I think I think it will probably be
fine but yeah what was 8 what Tron to go
watch Tron 2 and look at the age
transformation that they do in there
it's absolutely quite incredible I don't
think the production quality is going to
be quite on Tron 2 levels but they
should be able to do they should be able
to do quite a good job but with that I
think I'm gonna end it it's been like
almost an hour and I think I'm kind of
done scraping the the the last Actives
forum for news articles thank you guys
for watching I know it wasn't quite as
good as if I had a co-host here but I
did my best
tune in next week from
or great tech news I wanted to make sure
that I did this show for you guys just
because I knew we we didn't we were
almost not gonna have a LAN show this
week and we didn't have tech wiki
episodes this week so like both of the
sources of news from lioness media group
didn't make it to you guys so I thought
I'd I thought I'd try to scramble
together with John's help thank you very
much John from Linus Media Group for
writing the doc scrabbled together a
little little wine show for you guys so
yeah have a great weekend
try to plan for about a month from now
October 6 to show up to the charity
stream even if you're just going to come
say hi and I'll see you guys later
pixal three forgot about that
I am KB HD is gonna be all over that
we're gonna have coverage of pixel three
there's some leaks and stuff I'm excited
I'm probably going to get one anyways
the weekends have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
