before i do my full episode of SSD vs
hard drive i don't think i mentioned in
my last video i'm actually using a
vertex 60 gig drive so you can see
that's an ocz vertex 60 gig and it is
against a western digital one terabyte
black hard drive so I'm going to
demonstrate how an SSD doesn't slow down
when you start doing something in the
background so I'm going to go ahead and
I'm going to scan the whole computer on
both of these systems and then I'm going
to use the keyboard which is under the
camera man's arm to navigate up to open
adobe photoshop now i should mention
that i'm using exactly the same image of
windows i used acronis whatever it's
called their software to clone the hard
drive onto the SSD and we're going to
launch photoshop and see how long it
takes so the SSD even though it has an
anti-virus scan running in the
background boom photoshop is ready to go
whereas on the hard drive you can see
that there is a significant delay
whenever you're running something like
something that's accessing your drive in
the background</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
