at the Acer s 2 3 1 HL bi d
LED backlit LCD monitor this is part of
their Olympic edition monitor so while
the Olympics are over it is still an
Olympian of sorts and that it is a
unique well not completely unique these
days but it is a very very unique
product offering in that it has an LED
backlight and there are maybe other
monitors with LED backlights but I
haven't seen one yet so it's unique to
me see how I covered that up either way
let's have a look at what's included
with this particular monitor and talk a
little bit about the benefits of an
led-backlit LCD versus a conventional
fluorescent backlit LCD so actually I
want the cameraman to look up a
miniaturised version of that is exactly
what is behind most LCD panels so what
happens is that you actually have you
tend to get what's called hot spots so
those lights are actual tubes behind
your panel and so it has to be diffused
properly to get a nice even backlight so
you get some hot spots where it's more
washed out in some dark spots where it's
a little bit darker with an LED backlit
LCD the whole thing is completely
backlit with little points of light so
you get a nice even backlight one of the
other advantages is it's a pure white
backlight so you don't have any of the
disadvantages of an off-colored cathode
light behind the panel so you actually
get better more accurate colors you get
more consistent backlighting and you
also get better power consumption
because LEDs are much more efficient
than those fluorescent tube blades so
I've got all the accessories on pack
let's have a quick look at them here oh
cameraman is probably looking at this
what is this okay oh yeah and they're
thinner so because you have to have that
tube light you have to have some way in
front of it to diffuse it so that it is
evenly distributed you end up with a
thicker panel if you have a CCFL backlit
LCD so e color they're probably talking
about more color oh yeah better contrast
ratio yet another advantage this is a
twelve million to one active contrast
management contrast ratio
led maybe it's not quite bad hi in some
respects poor contrast ratios have
gotten a little bit ludicrous over the
last few years but I can assure you that
it's going to be better than a cathode
backlight LCD so we have a VGA cable
just in case you're still using one of
those with your fancy new monitor we
have a DVI cable that is also included I
highly recommend using this one because
that's how you're going to get the best
image quality out of it you've got a
power cable
take that out which plugs into a power
brick see there that really speaks to
the power efficiency of an LED backlit
LCD
that's the power of brick you're using
it's like there's like nothing to it
then we have the little stand that we're
going to use to attach the monitor to
presumably some kind of a base so let's
pull the monitor itself out okay there's
a piece of foam that is not the monitor
now I'm gonna pull monitor up no this is
the limited warranty agreement as well
as a QuickStart guide on a CD or monitor
next we're gonna pull out the monitor
and not drop the monitor it's okay it
comes on the phone so I'll get the phone
then well there we go
we finally got the monitor as well as
the base so here is uh oh yeah get
another cable includes the way they pack
this is just ingenious I'm not even
gonna try and get that out there ah it's
an HDMI cable there you go so I'm
guessing that this monitor supports VGA
DVI and HDMI based on the accessories
that we've seen here next we've got the
base so here is the one where we are so
a nice shiny plastic base and then
there's a screw on the bottom here for
attaching that little arm piece I'm
gonna get this mom I'm gonna get through
this plate assembled as quickly as I can
here so that we can have a look at the
overall aesthetic because that's
something that you know while you might
have specs on your side and there might
be all of these sort of
Marketing bullet points one of the most
important things about a monitor is
gonna be how it looks to you on your
desk because you have to stare at it an
awful lot and if it doesn't look nice
then you're not gonna like it
no matter how good the image quality is
for a lot of people anyway I mean not
everybody's like that but for me
certainly I wouldn't want to monitor
that I found ugly sitting on my desk for
I mean I don't know how long most of our
viewers will keep a monitor but I
usually keep monitor for at least 3 to 5
years I typically don't replace them
unless I absolutely have to so here we
go we've got all this was full of
marketing stuff okay so it's ultra-thin
there you can look at that while I'm
taking off this glass cover on the
monitor unless that's boring oh yeah
this is the same stuff that was on the
front of the box so it's mercury free
you know so not manufactured using
mercury that's good alright
making my way around here with these
tape which is quite difficult to remove
cleanly sorry about this everyone wow
they are really serious about protecting
the front of this panel it's like you
got your page you got your plastic yeah
more tape and more plastic there we go
mmm that's nice okay so for here for
thinness you're looking at about the
width of oh yeah sure cameraman wants me
to use his iPhone for comparison so it's
actually only about twice the thickness
of an iPhone at the top of the monitor
so that's very very cool and that's just
the bezel so when you actually look at
the screen itself it's even quite a bit
thinner than that because you've got a
fair bound to the bezel up here in front
of the monitor so if we just kind of
hold the iPhone there for thickness
comparison you can sort of see how thick
the the bezel here is and how thick an
iPhone is so it's incredibly slim now
it's a little bit thicker down at the
bottom because that's where you have all
of the electronics for your inputs as
well as oh here here's how we attach the
base so there's
little bits of spot right here or we can
put this in so it just slides in
presumably like this yeah
just like that and then if I had a
screwdriver I'd be able to put this in
more quickly but I don't so I'm going to
have to drive the screw with my hand
there we go
hey in a patient and that's in there
pretty good all right and then let's go
ahead and stand it on the base so this
particular model doesn't include any
real tilt options or any of that kind of
stuff but if you're looking for
something that's just really power
efficient and offers good color all that
good LED backlit goodness good contrast
ratio then this is probably the one for
you now we're going to actually be
testing this monitor a little bit better
when we do a full NCIX tech tips episode
comparing it against a conventional
cathode backlit LCD and that's really
the whole reason that I'm unboxing this
thing but just for the sake of having a
look at it but why don't we get the
cameraman to do some close-ups and you
die check out this particular LCD I you
know what I don't think I even mentioned
the resolution and the size of it this
is a 23 inch model and it is a 1920 by
1080 resolution so that means you can
watch Full HD video on here it's not
going to be scaled in any way it has a
16 by 9 aspect ratio so that means that
you're not going to see the black bars
on your content that you would on a 16
by 10 and that's a 1920 by 1200 panel so
let's have a look around in the back
where we have our vase amounts so you
got one two three four those so you can
mount this on a wall mount and it
wouldn't even have to be a very strong
one because this LCD monitor is
incredibly light so that's one of the
really cool things about it then we've
also got our inputs here which as I
guessed before our HDMI DVI and VGA in
here is the DCN so as I showed you
before it does have an external power
brick although it is quite small so you
just plug that in like that it does have
a Kensington lock here as well if you
need any anti-theft security so thank
you for checking out my unboxing
