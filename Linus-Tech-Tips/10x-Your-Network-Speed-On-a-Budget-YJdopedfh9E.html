terrible is this supposed to be on so
I'm not quite started yet Brendan sucks
okay quiet on set last time we showed
you how to quadruple your network speed
for $100 and you complained now some of
your complaints were misinformed in
applicable or otherwise completely
ridiculous the technology I demoed as I
mentioned in the video only works on
Windows 8 and up I mean come on and who
the devil invited this guy to my comment
section but some of the complaints were
very fair and even went as far as to ask
why it is that we're talking about an
admittedly flaky and proprietary
solution when there's a more broadly
applicable one also available on the
cheap so this video then is about how to
10x your network speed and yes thank you
iron cut that is internal network speed
not internet speed between two systems
on a budget
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more first order of
business there is no magic peanut butter
that you can smear in your network port
to turn it from a 1 gigabit to a 10
gigabit port so we will need new faster
network cards for our two systems and
while I could say alright then let's
head over to Amazon and grab a couple of
Intel X 540 10 gig cards with rj45 jacks
and then pick up a net gear 10 gig
switch which would work great and scale
well for the future by the way that
would cost 1500 US dollars which is like
a million Canadian roubles so no no we
won't be doing that instead as with most
of my budget guides we will begin by
shopping on eBay so let's find those
network cards we can save a lot of money
by buying retired server cards these
Emulex dealies have served us very well
cut it served us up that's a joke but
all the cheap ones out there have SFP+
connectors instead of the standard rj45
connectors that consumers are used to so
what do you do easy you'll need a direct
attached copper cable I've had good
experiences with the passive ones from
cables on demand comm and I've bought
from them a couple of times they cost
anywhere from 40 to 140 dollars and go
up to 10 meters so get a cable that is
long enough to go between the two
systems that you want to talk to each
other more quickly so probably your
personal desktop and your network
storage machine next we'll need to
actually that's about it we're going to
skip the network switch requirement by
attaching our computers to each other
directly so let's get to it
step one is to leave your onboard
network card plugged in to the rest of
your networked devices and your internet
connection pop those Knicks you bought
into the two machines run your cable
between the bed boom windows will
automatically detect the faster link
whenever those two machines talk to each
other which
oh I'm just kidding
Network crap is never that easy step two
with it still plugged in that part of
the first step was real configure the IP
addresses of your ten gig cards manually
you can follow the guide that we have on
the screen and if you're not sure what
to enter here check your existing
connection via IP config then leave the
first and second values the same and add
some amount so we're going to put 50 in
here to the third value this will be the
same for both of your machines then you
need to pick a unique number from 1 to
254 for the 4th these need to be
different between the two machines
you're connecting 255.255.255.0 is good
for the subnet mask and everything else
is left auto or blank step 3 for testing
disable other network interfaces and
disable Windows Firewall don't forget to
turn those back on when you're done or
you'll have no internet or unprotected
internet step 4 ping so we can see if
these two machines can see each other
properly by pinning the network
addresses that we manually entered for
the other machine then we can see if
they'll pick up each other's host names
with a slightly different command like
so step 5 is to set up Ram disks using
soft perfect Ram disk a free tool on
each machine a small Ram disk is fine
this is just to do a real-world test of
how quickly we can transfer files step 6
is to create test shares on both sides
on the RAM disks with read and write
permissions in both the sharing and
security tabs on both machines and then
you can change these to the permissions
that you want later on over there on ram
disk so they're going to disappear
anyhow
step 7 is to test the transfer using a
large file and you'll either be saying
holy shmow or WTF if it worked great if
you're in the WTF camp then or it stops
working later move on to step number 8
while in theory Microsoft should
prioritize the faster link between the
two computers
in practice we found that even manually
changing the priorities of our
interfaces wouldn't stick so we needed
to alter the hosts file in order to
statically assign that host name of the
PCs to their IP addresses that are on
the 10 gig network cards to prevent
these computers from talking over the 1
gigabit network that they are also
connected to for access to the Internet
and to your other devices so do it like
so substituting in whatever IP addresses
you're using for the ones that we've
entered and at that point step 9
it's a Christmas miracle unless step 10
your wife or brother or sister or
whatever is like how come Jeffery gets
faster network speeds and I don't well
if you had the foresight to buy a dual
interface that is 2 port card for the
file server then you can actually do the
same thing again by just buying another
cable and another NIC or network
interface card so all you've got to do
then is change the third value in the
manual IP address that you're setting
again so the server machine will
actually have three separate interfaces
on three separate subnets alter the
hosts files like so and step thirteen
test access between these computers so
you should see one gigabyte per second
between the two clients and the file
server and about 100 megabytes per
second between the two clients to each
other unless you want to take it one
step further with another cable and
another subnet if they all have dual
interface cards but I mean at that point
you might want to start thinking about a
network switch because you're basically
back to token ring speaking of which
tunnel bear is the easy to use VPN app
for mobile and desktop tunnel bear lets
you tunnel to up to 16 different
countries allowing you to browse the
Internet and use online services as if
you are in that different country they
have apps for iOS Android the PC and
Mack and they also have a Chrome
extension the apps are super easy to use
even if you're not a networking person
you don't have to do any of that port
forwarding nonsense or anything you just
turn the little dial it actually looks
like a little little dial you pick the
country that you want to browse the
Internet as though you're in and then
two things happen your connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and boom your public IP address gets
switched so you show up as if you are
somewhere else and if you do have any
trouble even though they've tried to
make it as simple as they possibly can
their friendly support Bears will be
there to help you they'll even give you
five hundred megabytes of data for free
to try it out with no credit card
required all you got to do is go to
tunnel bear comm /l TT and then if you
want to upgrade to unlimited you can
actually save 10% at our link as well so
