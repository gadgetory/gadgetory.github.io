that even when they're turned off they
still function as a regular old
staircase but what about your phone why
does the screen go black when you turn
it off instead of it showing my
wallpaper forever well it could if you
used an ePaper display like the king
broke a won a full on smartphone
promising four hundred hours of standby
battery life but are there enough
benefits to consider switching to eat
ink or is it more like ease stink
the fujitsu scansnap ix500 allows users
to easily manage edit and scan documents
business cards receipts and photos and
pretty much anything check it out at the
link in the video description
we're gonna get to all the downsides
above this phone in a minute but first
the benefits who would want this thing
to begin with well the company's
IndieGoGo campaign advertises it as
being optimized for eye health because
as long as you're in a brightly lit room
the phone doesn't have to emit any
harmful blue light for you to see the
screen that's because unlike the LCD or
OLED screens on most phones e-ink
displays don't work by shining light
through a pixel and into your eye
instead they're what's called reflective
displays where the light around you
either reflects off or is absorbed by
the white and black parts of the screen
just like most other objects around you
like my t-shirt or this banana the k1 is
certainly easy on the eyes and I
personally love reading on it and it
even comes with a Kindle app
pre-installed sure the phone is only
black and white but that can actually be
seen as another benefit bright saturated
colors are super stimulating to the
brain but are relatively rare in nature
your phone and its attention buying apps
is full of bright colors that contribute
to the urge to pull it out even if it's
just for a few seconds while you wait
for an elevator to arrive or your game
to load switching your phone to
grayscale is commonly recommended as a
strategy for fighting tech addiction
because it makes your phone less
interesting but the k1 takes us a step
further because there's no way to switch
the colors back on in a moment of
weakness it's like this forever and
finally I could also see this phone
being useful for certain occupations
because unlike regular screens that can
be near impossible to see in direct
sunlight
this one actually gets easier when it's
brighter and the battery life can be a
lot better depending on your use because
although it does take energy to update
the screen to create an image retaining
that image like the wallpaper takes no
energy at all that's how the K one's
3,100 milliamp power battery can claim
an amazing 400 hours of standby if the
phone's just sitting in your work trucks
love box but only a much more modest 20
hours of talktime which brings us to
what it's like to actually use this as a
phone it's pretty bad mostly because of
two interrelated problems app support
and latency the k1 does not support the
Google Play Store so
can't easily download apps instead
you're supposed to use the apps that
come pre-loaded with the phone or any
that become available later on when King
grows own app store finally launches in
whether we expect to be October and
maybe the people who want the phone
don't really need that many apps anyway
but the limited selection along with the
dated-looking UI and the jellybean era
app icons make the k1 feel like a
monochrome feature phone from the early
2000s but the reason they've made their
own custom version of Android 8.1 and do
not support the Play Store again comes
back to the screen the eating display
actually cannot pass Google's device
certification because they're just not
designed to display animations or videos
at high frame rates and by high frame
rates I mean anything above 10 fps
really now I gotta hand it to King grow
a little bit because unlike most ear
eaters that blink every time the screen
updates showing you the inverse of the
image then all black then all white the
k1 it is a little more choosy for
example on the kind of always-on display
the screen only does a partial update of
just the clock so it does still blink
which is actually pretty distracting
when it's sitting on your desk like you
think that I have notifications or
something but if you open up the browser
and go to YouTube you can actually watch
video the higher frame rate comes out
the cost of horrible horrible ghosting
that gets wiped away by a full blink
every minute or so but you can't do it
another thing you can do is take photos
with the 8 megapixel rear camera you can
even use one of several built-in filters
you just won't know what any of them
look like until you view them from
another device oh and the for selfie
fans this prototype has a front camera
but the final device will not so should
you buy this phone well unless you're
just super gung-ho and having basically
a smaller Kindle that can make phone
calls probably not I mean as far as
mid-range phones go with just 16
gigabytes of storage 2 gigabytes of RAM
and a mediatek helio p23 I think it's
way overpriced at 350 US dollars I mean
a redmi note 7 has better specs for half
the price
but on top of that I don't even agree
with their main claim about eye health
because the k-1 does have a backlight
you can turn it completely off but it
does have one which they claim does not
emit blue light but it looks pretty blue
to me and I'll probably be using it when
I'm scrolling my phone in bed and that's
actually worse than regular phones which
nowadays almost always have a nightlight
mode so with all that said plus the fact
that ever-present image retention makes
the screen a perpetual palimpsest I'm
recommending a pass to all but the most
avid ePaper fans door pupils are so
1990s with a ring video doorbell you'll
know who's at your front door without
ever getting up there welcome kit
includes their video doorbell to their
spotlight cam a battery and a solar
security sign the video doorbell too has
a motion sensor camera it's 1080p with
160 degrees of vision
it supports two-way audio and it's
either battery or 8 to 24 volt AC
doorbell wiring powered the spotlight
camera features 1080p HD video two-way
talk LED lights and is battery or solar
powered and it's got a siren the audio
on the ring doorbell too is great and
you can turn away unwelcome guests tell
them to come right in you know yo you're
unwelcome but sure fine you know your
mother-in-law or something and my
personal favorite is telling the Amazon
delivery driver to not run away after
the second knock on the door no no I'm
coming just a moment please
so get some peace of mind with the ring
welcome kit it's compatible with iOS
Android Mac and Windows PCs and
available at the link in the video
