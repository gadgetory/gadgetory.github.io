effective today I do not have a camera
person but I can give you guys so as an
apology for me having to sort of get o
it today I can give you guys a quick
tour of the new NCIX tech tips filming
studio so we've got a blue wall here
which will be the background for NCIX
tech tips I've got some power outlets
and some network outlets got a green
screen wall for all kinds of crazy cool
stuff we might want to do with that got
our cart that has is your usual sort of
knickknacks on it here's the pile of all
of the stuff that was in the old tech
tips room and that pretty much concludes
it today I'm gonna be having a look at
the Acer Aspire s7 this is an extremely
exciting notebook it has Windows 8 it
has a touchscreen and it is basically
just awesome so here's the full specs
11.6 inch HD touch panel LED LCD HD
Graphics 4000 for kids around the 256
gig SSD in this particular configuration
of it but what's most important about
this notebook is the fact that it is so
freakin small now this isn't a proper
retail box so there's gonna be some
things potentially missing like discs
and warranty and phone all that kind of
stuff but you can't see the power brick
no power brick is there's my iPhone for
comparison a little bit thicker than
iPhone for a little bit smaller than an
iPhone for a pretty reasonable size
considering that this is a core i3
machine so it's our excuse me this is a
core i7 machine and the form factor is
just outstanding a pillar let's just see
if there's anything else in here of it
so this is probably what the retail
packaging will look like but it will
actually have stuff in it so now let's
check out the machine itself now it has
just an awesome brushed it almost looks
okay I hate to use the word scratched
but it almost looks like it's got like
an aluminum sort of diamond pattern
scratch in it so it's going at kind of
diagonals here I like two things about
this it looks really nice and I like
that if you accidentally scratch it it
will be more hidden than something like
say for example an iPad 2 for the
aluminum is very plain very flat looking
the hinge is very well constructed
actually especially considering the size
you've got your indicator LEDs here for
charging as well as power and there's
another hinge right there
on the sides IO is pretty simple so you
got your microSD slot your headphone
microphone jack your USB 3.0 and that's
pretty much it on this side on the back
you find some ventilation lots of
ventilation as well as check that out
micro HDMI
very good stuff on the other side you've
got your power in you got your power
button and another super speed USB 3.0
jack at the front of the notebook you
find not a whole lot just some Acer
Aspire s7 branding you can see the
finish of this is just gorgeous so the
whole top cover is aluminum also got a
handle there for opening it up and then
the bottom is just plastic but it's a
very clean very nice looking just white
plain plastic you got speaker ports
built into the bottom of the notebook so
these don't reflect up off of whatever
hard surface you're on if you're on a
soft surface then you're not gonna have
ups are two points pointing at the sorry
that those are the intakes for the
ventilation speakers are here and here
so you got stereo speakers and they're
gonna reflect off of whatever it is from
the slight curvature of the notebook
body you can see you're gonna get a
little bit more sound so they're coming
out this way but I wouldn't I mean with
anything in this form factor I wouldn't
expect the speakers to be like amazing
or anything once we open it up we find a
standard keyboard layout we're gonna
find out how quickly it wakes up from
actually I think is this and sleep I
guess we'll find out one way or the
other
yeah I was in sleep hey I'm not sure
actually alright so once we get inside
we find a chiclet type with Kate
keyboard layout with no cardinal sins to
speak of so
we've got long shift keys and tricky
actually yeah correct Enter key
backspace delete are actually pretty
cleverly positioned long tab everything
in here looks okay if anything they've
shrunk some of the stuff that's stupid
like who uses the top of their Enter key
and who wants to hit the caps loft heel
key all the time not I they were using
like an edge to edge and like no we're
using it's using edge to edge glass
almost to the edge so there's a little
bit of aluminum here from sort of the
unibody top and then it goes right to
here that's where the glass is so
that'll allow you to easily swipe in
from the bottom or swipe in from the
side this is an engineering sample
notebook so actually some of the
gestures aren't working correctly on it
so forgive me guys this is not a
finished product but the actual one will
work correctly for all of the gestures
that you want to do screen is actually
pretty darn good so you've got
reasonable viewing angles it is glossy
so you do have to contend with that here
this is probably gonna be a better way
to give you guys a look at it so there
you go viewing angles aren't quite
excellent if you come up here you can
still see it very very well and what I
like most about this is the portability
it weighs almost nothing so here I never
did show you guys my iPhone comparison
for the thinness of the overall notebook
which is just crazy
tiny tiny things so there that gives you
some idea of the size of this notebook
and then the thinness here I go I can
move it to the edge you almost lose it
in the yeah in the cloth here very very
thin very light because of the aluminum
plastic construction very solid feeling
so I would actually use this with
confidence like this because the hinge
is quite sturdy like I wouldn't worry
about it breaking or anything which is
usually the case on notebooks of this
kind of size and here is aluminum as
well so that's again what contributes to
the sturdiness of the machine touchpad
is reasonably sized to actually here
I'll do another iPhone size comparison
haha reasonably sized actually for a
notebook of this size as well and the
correct the correct aspect ratio for the
sixteen by nine screen so it's a 1366 by
768 screen on there I think that pretty
much wraps it up thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at the Acer Aspire s7 it's kind of
a lie calling this a first look because
this is not the first time I've looked
at it I'm really excited about this
notebook I've been playing around with
