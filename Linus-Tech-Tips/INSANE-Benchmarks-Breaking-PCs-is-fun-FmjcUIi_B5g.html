its hundred and fifty FPS and doom maybe
it is but how does it fare when you roll
7,000 wheels of cheese down a hill
stress testing with Ida and fer Marcus
for chumps compared to exploiting
hilarious features of popular game
engines you see every once in a while a
video comes out of someone doing
something silly in a video game that
looks rather impressive while completely
crippling their computer's performance
we've got examples like the classic 3000
barrel explosion in Crysis 1 the
previously mentioned thousands of cheese
wheels rolling down a hill in Skyrim
tons of tnt altering the landscape of
the map and minecraft and most recently
a huge amount of nuke mines going off
and fallout 4 they're fun because of the
insane amount of physics events usually
cause computers of mere mortals to
figuratively melt but we here at Linus
tech tips have a literal warehouse of
high-end hardware so equipped with a 68
50k a couple of Nvidia $1200 Titan XP
graphics cards and a 10 Core Extreme
Edition 69 50 X let's see if we can hold
these beasts off
intel skull Canyon Nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the
link in the video description first
things first let's start with test
subject number 1 which is what I'm
calling our first test bench there's
going to be much changes but still it's
got a 5820k for its processor which is
cooled by a big dual rad and we have a
Titan XP along with 32 gigs of ram so
it's a ridiculously high in system
already and we'll be upgrading it later
on moving on down from here we're
following the HDMI cable all the way
down to the HDMI splitter as you can see
we have three cables here because I need
to see what's going on and we need to
record it so one of these cables comes
up to our Aveo 4k epifanio card and that
goes into this laptop which will be
capturing the footage so we can show
that to you guys on the green screen and
then if we rotate a little bit I have my
own monitor that I can see off to the
side so I edited the island map in
Crysis 3 to add like 3,500 explosive
barrels I think it is right now in fraps
I'm getting about 60 to 70 FPS but it
does feel a little sluggish you can see
all these barrels floating in the air
here now if I happen to bump into one of
them that would start a cascading
physics event similar to how Domino's
work but because there's so many of them
it's going to cause the computer to have
some problem so let's try this I'm just
going to bump into the barrel oh and you
can see I'm just kind of like sliding
around here and physics events are
repeating so it's teleporting me back
close to the barrels hurting me a little
bit moving all the barrels by a chunk
and then teleporting me back so running
into the barrels is actually worse than
blowing them up which is kind of funny
so let's blow them up so begin the fraps
benchmark and fire the bullet you can
see the shell on the right side of the
gun actually lags as it's coming out and
then as the explosion happens you'll
notice that there's a little bit of
repetition in style that's because each
one of the barrels is blowing up
the same way as all the other barrels
there's an insane amount of things just
flying around the screen right now and
you can see them moving in chunks and
you can actually notice that the
different physics events are being
updated at different times because as
big luke is pointing at right now the
barrel explosions are all happening at a
faster rate than the barrel fragments
are flying away from them and you can
see the water moving at its own rate as
well and now that the explosions are all
done the fragments from the barrels are
starting to move at a much higher rate
the overall frame rate of the computer
is picking up so we're at about 24 fps
right now there is still a lot of stuff
flying around again I can move somewhat
okay it is very chunky but the swaying
movement of my gun on the screen is
actually totally fine the only problem
is my actual movement across the map and
there's still a huge amount of barrel
fragments in the air now if we can get
over to the pile of where the barrels
are yeah here we go you can see that
there's just a huge amount of tops and
bottoms of barrels this is what I was
talking about how it kind of multiplies
the amount of things that are in the
scene if I bump into them I even shutter
and get hurt and we'll probably
eventually die and the game's going to
lag out a little bit as all the barrels
kind of move themselves anyways this was
cool move on to the next one for our
next experiment we will need Elder
Scrolls Skyrim find your favorite hill
or mountain side stand up on it save
your games you can come back to it more
easily because your computer may crash
open up your console by pressing one of
the buttons in the top left-hand ish
corner of your computer also known as
tilde and now that we have unlocked the
power of the console we will summon our
wheels of cheese hahaha you will do this
by typing in player dot place at me
space zero zero zero six for b-36 just
think of it afar as our evil incantation
then we will put in the amount that we
want to summon in this case 1000 because
we haven't summoned any yet so we're not
super worried about performance effects
we will press enter you will see cheese
appear on the screen but not much happen
you then need to lower the console by
pressing the tilde button and then
all of the cheese but that is not enough
we have not seen a major performance
impact on the fraps number in the lower
corner so we must summon more press the
tilde key again press the up arrow key
to bring back our previous incantation
press the Enter button again because we
want a thousand more wheels of cheese
press the tilde button for it to go away
and more more Jesus summoned let's move
up to 6000 this is usually where I start
having problems six thousand six
thousand five hundred is a pretty bad
time in terms of how the computer's
gonna be able to manage things you can
see some of the last bits of cheese that
are coming from my most recent
incantation are still trickling down the
hill because everything's just going so
slowly at this point so we're now
sitting about four or five FPS time to
be relentless Oh nope nope nope
we have apparently been relentless
enough the computer is done there will
be no more cheese summoning today sir so
next up we have fallout 4 where we're
going to throw down while the original
plan was 5000 nuke mines okay so one
thing I'm going to do right now is just
save the game new save file and then
load it just to kind of make sure that
everything's good cuz I do need to run
this test twice okay oh dear that
doesn't look good at all I'm pretty sure
every time I load the save files oh okay
yeah I don't know what it's doing now
hopefully it's going to work apparently
every time that I load the save game
with my 500 mine's laid down it explodes
so we're going to pretend that I wasn't
going to do this benchmark and we're
going to move on to minecraft our plan
here is to suddenly and drastically
change a part of the map we're going to
do that with 1000 blocks of TNT in a 10
by 10 by 10 column going straight down
into the earth man this is actually
surprisingly easy with creative mode
I've never really played creative mode
much and just as a note you will need
Flint what
oh okay I screwed up put the Flint again
right click there we go
then I'm going to go God fly away please
we're going to watch it explode
oh my freaking goodness that didn't hurt
the computer that much we only went down
to about 16 FPS minimum and you can see
just how cool that was we created this
like massive well okay we opened up a
massive cave system that was already
here and we made this like huge
waterfall which was absolutely just a
river before now the river leads to this
giant waterfall that goes into the cave
system that looks super cool and the
computer actually dealt with it pretty
well okay so I had all of that prepared
ahead of time but what I don't know is
if upgrading the hardware from here by
adding another two CPU cores and another
video card will let us push further
so let's swap hardware to a 69 50 X and
add in another Titan XP and try all
those tests again rapid fire we're going
to drop in here hit it with some flint
go back up oh geez
there we go and watch as it goes down oh
all the way down to three FPS and it
completely destroyed everything actually
oh yeah it took a sec there to load the
map I don't think I would say that that
performed any better than the previous
one to the point where I might actually
say performed worse 1000 wheels of
cheese fly down the mountain ah ah ah mm
wheels of cheese fly down the mountain
uh 6000 wheels of cheese and we're now
dropping down to about 6 FPS we're
getting a little bit lower than before
so test subject number 2 just aired out
at about 7,000 wheels of cheese that is
worse than test subject number one but I
don't know how much stock I would take
in that as test subject number one
usually was airing out at about 6500
wheels of cheese okay so this is the
only one that we're actually running
fraps for and it begins you can see the
shell lagging just as before alright so
that was actually a pretty huge
improvement we went from six point four
to eight point five for two fps that's
pretty significant when you're at that
low of a number so if you're use
for your computer is constantly staring
at three and a half thousand barrels
exploding in crisis one I would
definitely recommend to tighten X's and
a 69 50 X but if not you probably don't
have to go that hard core in terms of
hardware I know this was a ridiculously
silly video but I had fun I hope you did
as well if you liked it like it and get
subscribed and all that kind of stuff
and if you're like this video is useless
and adds nothing to the overall
conversation and you should be more
intellectual about your videos and this
was terrible you can hit the dislike
button that would be fine
check out Amazon in the description down
below if this somehow inspired you to
buy something also check out the link in
the description down below to find a
shirt we have some cool lines Beauty
groupie shirts that you can pick up
watch this video which is our review
announcement video thing on the 69 50 X
where we discuss how ridiculously
expensive it is because holy crap</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
