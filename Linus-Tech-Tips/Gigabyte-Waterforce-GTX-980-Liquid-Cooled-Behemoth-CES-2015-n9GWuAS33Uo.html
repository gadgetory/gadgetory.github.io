brought to you by phantom glass visit
store phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX sometimes building the most
extreme ridiculous thing is more
important for whatever reason then pure
practicality and this is the gigabyte
water for something I've only ever seen
in pictures and videos before and let me
tell you it looked impressive there it
looks much more impressive here the way
it works is you actually get an entire
kit for $3,000 so this is not for the
faint of heart but you get an entire kit
that includes an sli bridge with
illumination three gtx 980 graphics
cards all of which are overclocked a
support brace for the three graphics
cards you get this front panel
pass-through over here and you get these
six tubes and power module that run to
this massive like cooling unit that sits
on the top of your computer so it's held
on with little clamps here and it's got
a little fan in the VAR it's got a
little dial in the front where you can
go ahead and you can like adjust your
fan RPMs or something I don't know what
I'm adjusting yeah select fans turn
those up and you can adjust your pump
RPMs you can set a target temperature
for your graphics cards pretty freakin
cool stuff and it even opens up so you
can pull off the front pull up the top
and you can see that each of the
graphics cards inside here actually gets
its own single 120 millimeter radiator
and then all those tubes come into the
system and then the radiators are cooled
by 120 millimeter fans that you can see
I've actually lifted up off of the top
of the rads here so I'm gonna put it
back together since it's not actually
going to be cooled very well if I take
the fans all off the rads but I guess
what is there to say about this other
than Wow speaking of things that are
more about the extreme than the
practical this my friends is the x99
super overclocked champion board they're
just launching this here at the show and
it's got a whole bunch of features that
most people are never going to care
about and it actually lacks some of the
features that your more mainstream user
might find
important for example it only has four
ddr4 dimm slots instead of the standard
eight that you'd find on an X
ninety-nine bother board why you might
ask well because it issues spending up
that space on the PCB for more DIMM
slots in favor of much more robust power
delivery things like putting six times
the gold plating that would be standard
inside the CPU socket DIMM slots and PCI
Express Lanes
and building in some crazy overclocking
features that the guys behind us are
taking advantage of with liquid nitrogen
cooling trying to set some World Records
overclock some x99 chipset sand some you
know fifth generation in eight core
processors as far as they can and that
is basically the point of this is this
the most practical thing for you know
your average guy who's gonna drive 6070
miles an hour on the freeway no but if
you want to feel like you could open it
up and go 200 miles an hour then I guess
this might be for you and it comes with
a cool color scheme to match guys thank
you for checking out our look at
gigabytes extreme gaming products here
in their suite
don't forget our trip to the show is
powered by phantom glass the one and
only screen protector you guys will ever
need for your phone it's made of Gorilla
Glass
just like the screen that's already on
your phone though that means it's clear
that means it's nice and smooth to touch
it's got that same oleophobic resistant
coating so you don't get fingerprints
all over the place and it has a nano
coating on the bottom that makes it
pretty much impossible to apply with any
bubble stuck in it and makes it so it
can be taken off and reapplied if you
ever need to arm a your phone or
whatever else the case may be you can
learn more about it and order one at
store phantom glass which is linked in
the video description and also a
