for many years in multiple forms and it
seems like they always follow the same
script the experience at launch with no
accessories or just a couple of weird
ones is net at best which leads to poor
sales which leads to very little
incentive to keep creating accessories
for the tiny user base which ultimately
leads to failure so I guess that's why a
soos went full hem preparing not just a
couple but an entire suite of gaming
related gaming related accessories for
their ROG phone some of which like oh
yeah this one right here give you such a
big competitive edge that they should
probably be considered cheating anywho
we've got all of them so we're just
gonna like get these puppies opened up
and go through a uh oh oh hold on a
second oh right sponsors glass wire lets
you instantly see your current and past
network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device use offer code - and get
25% off glassware at the link in the
video description
the biggest issue to me with the
accessories on some of the devices that
I alluded to before was that the
features that they offered this was
particularly true in the case of the
Moto Z and it's modules didn't have a
clear benefit over existing device
agnostic options and or they were
unreasonably expensive so challenge
number one for Asus is at a reasonable
price giving me functionality that is as
good or greater than someone else's one
size fits all option so we've got their
desktop dock here that's gonna cost you
about two hundred and thirty bucks we've
got their professional dock so we'll
figure out what the difference is there
that's gonna cost you 120 we've got the
who these ones are who the Y gig dock is
gonna be 330 and then the twin View dock
is gonna be $400 with in my opinion the
most interesting one for most people the
game vice coming in at 90 bucks so
that's looking okay kind of mixed bag I
guess but even the good things here are
gonna be worthless if they can't address
challenge number two building a good
enough phone that you'd actually want to
use it when it's not docked to an
accessory so the ROG phone them it's
decidedly futuristic looking with near
360-degree Gorilla Glass uses
ubiquitously edgy line design and fancy
orange accents the screen is a six inch
HD R OLED panel rocking a 2160 by 1080
resolution with in my opinion far more
importantly this watery smooth 90 Hertz
refresh rate like honestly other
manufacturers out there take notice
because this needs to be way more common
on mobile devices and while we're at it
this does - yes my friends it has a
headphone jack though to be clear other
manufacturers I'm not saying you should
all be more like cases in every way
because the UI design of the default
theme on this phone is tarah bad the
only good thing I can say about it is
that they give you the option to change
it so we made a custom theme that looks
as close to stock Android as possible
and then we pretended like the
thing just never happened the volume and
lock buttons are pretty clicky which is
nice but given that they're on the same
side and close together I wish they had
kind of different textures so that
they're easier to feel in your pocket
and then on the opposite side you've got
your buttons but rather something that
you've probably never seen before this
double USB type-c port thing so asus is
touting this as a way to charge your
phone without obstructing your hands
while you're gaming and I'm with them
there but whether this was an unintended
side effect or not it's also finally the
solution to the longtime issue of
charging your phone while watching
Netflix in bed and it gets better it
also serves as a connection hub for most
of the accessories that we're going to
get into in a little bit here I got to
turn that down
oh yeah the speakers are really loud
almost all of the accessories connect
directly to this special port which by
the way has a huge warning on it out of
the box not to plug power into the wrong
one because half of it is wired up more
normally like for charging while the
other half is presumably set up for the
rest of the HDMI output Gigabit LAN
second headphone jack and a presumably
laser vision functionality that's
included with this phone now actually
asus couldn't confirm that last one
another thing that sets this device
apart is the cpu so yes it's a
snapdragon 845 like all the other
flagship phones from this year but asus
is actually bidding the SOC z'
specifically for this phone allowing
them to reach two point nine six
gigahertz as opposed to the stock two
point eight gigahertz it doesn't sound
like a lot probably because it isn't but
it's enough to call it the fastest 845
equipped phone and this does show in our
synthetic tests too bad the Snapdragon
855 is already upon us anyway because of
that extra clock speed boost it's bound
to run hotter and to combat this a seuss
implemented a massive vapor chamber like
this is a pretty heavy phone and copper
plate that does seem to mostly work with
the warmth evenly spread out throughout
most of the device under load instead of
just kind of singeing your fingers on
one hand instead of both of them battery
life is also a plus thanks to the thick
4,000 milliamp hour battery inside which
brings us then to the accessories now I
could give you some fancy b-roll of them
while I read out the spec list but
instead Jake and I are just gonna try
them all out and give you guys some
candid live impressions what are we
gonna do first okay so this is the one
accessory you get for free this is the
ROG phone cooling fan basically it's
just got a little sliding slider so that
it can clamp on to the phone it's got a
little tiny link what would that even be
like a 30 mil fan yeah I'm stupid like
that little tiny fan that's got kind of
like a ventilation thing about it here
and then it's got their proprietary dual
seat connector and then the charging
port and a headphone jack
now did you like try to benchmark this
or what see I tried but phone's the way
that they like temperatures and stuff
it's kind of inconsistent like I'd load
up a game the same scene and the phone
would be at 35 and then I'd do it again
and it would be at 32 like regardless of
putting the fan on so I don't know but
it like subjectively when you have it on
it definitely feels cooler in the hand
right it's just a matter of how much
that change in surface temperature is
actually affecting the initialize based
on how the cooling layout is inside
there yeah so this is interesting the
way that it works is that you actually
aren't expecting a lot of the cooling to
happen here
like there's no thermal compound or
anything like that so it just vents the
air out either side so you know I could
kind of see it cooling your hands as
much as cooling the phone being a
benefit here it goes pretty loud
actually
oh and it's got a little RTP light on
the back so if you turn R on it you
don't lose your RGB light anymore for
gaming yeah I got that dinosaur yeah oh
my god
Oh actually he's unconscious I didn't
kill him I think but does it feel hot on
your hand or what no actually I think
for me the biggest benefit is not even
like cooling the phone necessarily but
because you know how your hands can get
sweaty when you're holding a warm phone
but the phone doesn't even feel warm you
can see your GPU 70% oh yeah it's got
that cool little overlay 31 degrees on
the phone that's like that's the low 30
that's the lowest I've ever seen it like
probably like well out here in the
warehouse this is true yeah yeah that's
probably a factor okay hit me with the
game vice so basically the way this guy
works is you've got both halves of a
controller
you've got your r1 r2 l1 l2 and then
you've got kind of this flexible bit
here that stretches a little bit so it's
kind of spring-loaded on the inside
there oh and this guy only uses the side
type-c or the phone actually comes with
two games this one's kind of like a pub
G clone are they even trying to make it
not look like a pudgy clone it's looks
like a dating game like Sims or
something like that you know like Grand
Theft Auto dating thug dating Holmes man
these controls are so much better than
trying to use on screen okay so I'm not
a huge fan of how the positioning of
like the a button compared to the
positioning of the stick here
a be mobile okay so this game doesn't at
least from what I understand doesn't
natively support these controls but Asus
has this really really sick feature
which I should probably show it once we
were actually in a game but you can set
custom key mapping right and so this is
so there that's just your analog stick
so you just kind of plump that down
wherever the analog stick is in the game
and then the game has no idea so even if
they try and block this for like
competitive reasons mmm how are they
gonna do that there's no way yeah so
then this is just look yeah I don't love
it wherever you want and change that's -
Wow that's already cool have individual
sticks even like I can't even tell the
difference between the one that's maps
natively and the one that we just set up
if you don't have this controller
actually you can also configure
something called air triggers and so
they're these little like I think
they're 20 gram actuation point little
like ultrasonic buttons here so your
triggers can be actually on top of the
phone so you don't haven't have that on
the screen so that can be cool too
yeah I gotta no way what what the heck
okay come on oh you got him all right so
clearly more configuration required yeah
does it support like multiple profiles
like driving profile and stuff I think
so I don't know I think you could just
make a new one or something right okay
so that's hard to do yeah and this is
the twin view this is heavy
yeah I mean there's a lot inside like
there's a fan at the top I think it's
probably a beefier one than the little
fan attachment you have the full same
screen as on the phone so that's the
same six inch OLED super nice panel and
a six thousand milliamp hour battery
okay so that's basic 1.5 the phone on
top of and a full sized SD card reader
yeah hell yeah
what I don't even know what you would
use that but then like it's so weird cuz
they only put one shoulder button on
each side yeah I think the point is you
still use like the firing on the screen
yeah and then you can have your triggers
oh yeah baby
dude this boat is fast okay I'm checking
a little bit now though yeah but I can
feel it that's crazy like this is a
weird use case but I think there is one
game that actually makes use of both
screens okay well the ones they included
it's the pub G clone I think you can
have your map up top here yeah I still
don't have a ton of hope first I'm not a
hundred percent of the really nice on
this one I mean I'd love to hear your
comments below guys like what would you
use the dual screens for here so next up
we've got the mobile desktop dock which
gives you microphone headphone hdmi and
displayport gigabit ethernet for USB
threes and manufacturers okay everyone
stop doing this if it's not thunder pull
don't put like a little lightning thing
near it I know that's not technically
the same one but just stop they mean
power but it looks like Thunderbolt
don't do that
another DisplayPort one of those
horrible USB micro-b three ones and then
an SD why does this a sink do they mean
sy and see like these are both one out
but you know what let's not worry too
much about that so what's the point of
this so this is a way to be able to use
your phone with your regular computers
accessories when you don't want to use
the phone it just acts as a pass-through
for your regular desktop but the really
really dumb thing is that cable you're
talking about earlier you have to use
that to pass through the USB
functionality to the PC and it doesn't
come with that cable does this have its
own cooling fan that's like ripping it
up in there oh that is loud oh yeah I
think you can't do that in the game
mobile to desktop docking is one of
those like who's asking for this things
there we go Jake let's watch the Sabrina
the Teenage it's not even like I know
you do the full screen events like it
works yeah but that's still a bad
experience oh wait oh okay and you can
so that's kind of working it's just the
games I bet you they specifically lock
it out of those like pub G type games so
if you're like really into tower defense
games I guess this is kind of cool I've
never been sold on like a an Android
desktop experience before and I don't
think I'm solo today do you think it
passes through do you think to come on
it might it's worth a shot at least or
kg sink
can this dock do it oh wow yeah it did
pass through do you think and it's 4k so
I guess if you don't want to spend $330
on that I don't there is this okay so
this is the non ROG version whoa okay
Kate you actually need this what so you
still get the same the stand like
functionality out of the cardboard
are you kidding no I'm not joking this
is an is advertised functionality right
here I guess they weren't expecting such
a heavy phone anyway I mean this still
looks alright though you've got your
Ethernet you've got your USB three
you've got your power in HDMI I mean
this overall this looks like it makes
more sense to me other than the how to
build a sous professional dock stand
yeah I've never seen anything more
professional in my life and this this
this is fine this is pro the other thing
not pro try this so you have to enable
Ethernet in the Ethernet menu so I've
got that turned on do think we get an IP
oh yeah yeah yeah so it seems to be
working what do you think Oh Danny
so yeah that's it's like not even used
to this okay so yeah that definitely
works all right so one more accessory
then this is the Big Kahuna
kids say Kahuna yeah so this is the wide
gig dock it's got USB and HDMI so it's
like got way less functionality than the
other ones except it does USB and HDMI
wirelessly using why gig so all we got
to do theoretically is enable Y gig
we've already got this thing paired and
theoretically so a thing will happen
here hey okay you can use that too are
you playing games
yeah latency good really good
compression not as good look at the way
it's weird some things are really sharp
ya know it takes a second yeah so that's
what that's what's going going down here
see like watch these logos as I scroll
through them they see that like when
they're in motion they look like
absolute garbage and then it like takes
the SAG so in fairness to this most
people probably wouldn't be sitting 4
feet from a 77 inch screen but to say
that there is a clear image quality
difference here like even when we
account for it being blown
would be an understatement look if you
come and have a look at like yeah
there's quite a bit of compression yeah
there's a lot of compression like that
the image is quite fine here and it's
quite less fine here like this text
would be sharp if we weren't Wireless
right now latency though like you said
is really good like that's that's
probably better than a wireless Xbox
controller on this TV you know what I'm
actually less impressed now that I'm
looking at it side-by-side again in
fairness this is a 90 Hertz display and
that's super not and it's super wireless
but like I'd probably have to come up
with some other use cases for it other
than gaming to justify it for myself
anyway oh he's got buddies oh yeah so
the conclusions are pretty mixed here
the desktop dock I guess is pretty cool
if you have a use case for it I
personally don't really and I think the
same can be said for the wide gig dock
with price being a serious concern for
both of those the professional dock
though I quite like other than the
cardboard box
stupid stand thing that they're doing
but I think the real star of the show
has got to be the game vise here because
this plus a portable battery pack to me
makes more sense than this one in terms
of how much better it legitimately makes
you at real games like how much more
competitive it makes you so I'm pretty
happy with my experience overall but I
think Casey still has a lot of
fine-tuning to do for what will
undoubtedly be an ROG phone to let me
know in the comments what you guys think
which ones were your favorites which
ones did you think were the worst
