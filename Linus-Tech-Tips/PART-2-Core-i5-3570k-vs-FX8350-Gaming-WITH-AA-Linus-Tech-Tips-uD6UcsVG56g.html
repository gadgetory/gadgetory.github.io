trusted graphics partner Nvidia welcome
to part 2 of our 35 70 K versus 80 350
testing so just to reiterate we've
already done no anti-aliasing on a
number of popular games now what we've
decided to do is crank up the details
now any of the games where the maximum
presets we're already factoring in high
anti-aliasing settings those ones you're
going to discover actually haven't
changed whereas everything else what
we're doing is we're taking our gtx
660ti which is the card we're using for
our standard test bench and we are
taxing it so we're looking at observe
the GPU bound scenario what happens to
the CPU in this situation because a lot
of the hubbub right now is the 8350
which is an eight-core processor so
we're running that on a crosshair v
formula the 8350 is a very legitimate
choice for a gaming platform if you're
running at realistic settings now of
course you could all day we could run
quake three flybys and you know time how
long it takes to run and run at 640 by
480 and that would really separate out
the single-threaded cpu performance of
every chip on the market but it's not
realistic so that's why we're taking
this this realistic approach where we
have two identical test platforms in
fact if this test platform except over
there so we're running at the 8350
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz we're
running our 35 70 K overclock to 4.4
gigahertz the reason we chose those
numbers was that we wanted something
that is realistically attainable by you
like 99% of the time so almost anyone
running these chips can reach those
frequencies with guides that have
actually been published in videos that
I've done in the past so there's really
no excuse for not being able to do that
so that's why we ran at those settings
we're running eight gigs of mush Kin
whatever it's called black line memory
1600 megahertz cl9 nothing special about
it we're running a 128 gig vertex for
SSD
and Republic of gamers motherboards for
both platforms some in wind power supply
that doesn't really affect performance
in any meaningful way and we're liquid
cooling the CPUs using an H 100 from
Corsair just so that we get good
stability at those overclock settings so
let's start with Metro 2033 in Metro
2033 the 35 70 K really pulls ahead of
the 80 350 so this is on the high preset
with anisotropic filtering at 16x and
anti-aliasing at 4x our next one is dirt
three and in dirt three we see the same
situation where the 35 70 K pulls ahead
by about 10% so this is out actually
yeah this is a tangible wind but not
something you're actually going to feel
when you're playing the game itself in
Skyrim we see another victory for the 35
70 K however it should be noted that in
Skyrim were running 18 aftermarket mods
from the Steam Workshop and we're not
sure how those affect any optimizations
that are made on a platform by platform
basis so it's possible that our
particular Skyrim setup is inherently
runs better on Intel and unfortunately
there's not really a whole lot we can do
about that up next we've got battlefield
3 where the FX 8350 actually comes out
ahead now battlefield 3 was one of the
first really multi-threading aware
triple-a gaming titles that you started
to see a tangible benefit with more
cores so FX 8350 doing well here
actually makes a lot of sense because it
is clocked a little bit higher did I say
4.4 gigahertz for the 35 70 K because
what I meant was 4.2 sorry about that
guys
so what we see here is that with its
higher frequency and the fact that it's
multi-threading aware it does really
well so we're running four times NSAA
anti-aliasing next up we've got Crysis 3
so this is one of the ones where there's
been a lot of discussion about how
Crysis 3 is heavily multi-threading
aware and I've seen I've even seen
proclamations that the 8350 just you
know wrecks the 35 70 K but those seem
pretty isolated and the most of the data
out there seems to support our
conclusion which is that the 35 70 K
a ekes out a victory here it's not by
much it's only by about 10% but that for
all intents and purposes they are very
close in performance and I mean okay
we're going to move on to our last
benchmark here which is that's not our
last one yeah they're very close in
terms of performance so we're not really
seeing the whole huge difference in
performance favoring the 8350 far cry 3
is a different situation with the 8350
winning by 10% now the weird thing is
both of these games are based on
CryEngine 3 so it looks like whatever
individual optimizations the game
developers have put into there their
titles for whatever reason one of them
favors AMD more than the other one does
so it tells us a couple of things number
one Crysis 3 doesn't necessarily run
better on AMD but number 2
CryEngine 3 can Starcraft 2 were
including just kind of for lols but
Intel runs away with this one Starcraft
2 seems to be heavily single-threaded
performance dependent and our last title
is crisis - so not Crysis 3 Crysis 2
where we see a very similar story to
Crysis 3 with the 35 70k coming out by
out ahead by about 10% so what does all
this mean like what CPU should you
actually buy it because remember guys 35
70k doesn't have hyper threading so when
you have a heavily threaded workload say
for example you're doing video rendering
3d rendering heavy heavy Photoshop use
where you're going to be able to take
advantage of those multiple course the
8350 may actually be a better choice for
you because the 3570 is quad core and
the 8350 is for bulldozer modules each
of which is kind of like a core and a
half so you're going to have just more
horsepower more oomph to throw at
heavily multi-threaded applications with
that in mind I don't know what you're
gesturing oh okay with that in mind the
35 70k does pull ahead in the single
threaded heavy applications and does run
cooler and does consume less power
so depending on how much power costs in
your particular area that may be a
factor for you but it should be noted
that you're looking at probably a few
dollars a year in
the actual power difference depending
again on how much power costs in your
area here in BC Canada it's cheap so
it's not something that we think about
nearly as much as if you lived say for
example in California where it can be
very expensive so I think that pretty
much wraps it up they're both viable
gaming platforms at the end of the day
you have to look at the results go ok
this is the average FPS am I going to
notice the difference between 5 fps or 3
FPS or 10 FPS here and there if you
think you will go for whichever one
comes out on top and if you think you
won't then go for whichever one is going
to serve you better as an overall
platform thanks for checking out this
