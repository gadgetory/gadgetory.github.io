announced the GTX 1080 last year there
was already speculation that the GTX 10
atti would launch shortly and I guess
they were running on valve time though
in their defense that is still quite a
bit better than AMD time at this point
so here we are then 10 months later and
we finally got the latest Titan killer
from Nvidia and at roughly half the cost
get amped
HP's new omen X lineup comes equipped
with Intel's seventh generation Core i7
processor check it out at the link in
the video description so the GPU market
has been pretty quiet lately and for
good reason there just hasn't really
been much in the way of direct
competition between our beloved red and
green giants since nvidia has stuck to
the high end for their 16 nanometer
product launches and AMD has been busy
building out their mid-range and budget
lineup thankfully for those of us who
are interested in the high-end Nvidia
has graciously decided that they're just
plumb old sick of selling GP 102 video
cards for over $1000 and turned it up to
11 with the GT X 1080 Ti the founders
edition flavor of which they've sent
over for our evaluation it's got 11 gigs
of gddr5 X memory at 11 gigabit per
second I see what they did there which
is 1 gigabyte less than the Titan XP but
at a higher speed to substantially
increase memory throughput good thing
too because we go from a 384 bit memory
bus down to 352 bit it has the same
number of cuda cores at 3584 and while
they share the same transistor count of
12 million the 1080 TI's cores boost up
to a rated 1582 megahertz instead of
1531 so far so good but what the 1080 TI
lacks compared to the Titan XP and I
mean aside from the DVI port that they
ditched in favor of more exhaust room
for the fan is ROPS
I mean to be clear it has them just
fewer we go from 96 down to 88 while
also losing 256 kilobytes of level 2
cache which is a part of what allows
NVIDIA to build the 1080 Ti for less but
how is that going to affect performance
is it possible that this time Titan XP
owners will get to continue to enjoy a
performance advantage however small in
return for that hefty early adopter tax
they paid well in our lineup is the
Titan XP the new kids little brother GT
X 1080 the last gen gtx 980ti
then it directly replaces and for
giggles since you can't even really buy
one we've also included AMD's fastest
GPU to date the Radeon r9 fury X so that
then is business as usual but wait
there's something different our Intel
test bench will have a core i7 7700 K
and our AMD test bench whoa
two test benches will have a risin 7
1800 X on a gigabyte horas a X 370
gaming 5 because max dropped our aces
crosshair 6 why both you might ask well
because if you've been waiting for Rison
and the GT X 1080 Ti to drop in order to
start your next upgrade or new build
well you're probably also waiting for
benchmarks that combine the two so don't
worry then hypothetical viewer we've got
you covered
we'll kick things off with Deus Ex
mankind divided in DirectX 11 on the AMD
platform our 1080 TI was neck-and-neck
with the Titan XP and on our Intel bench
actually beat it out moving into DirectX
12 we see the Nvidia lineup stumble
somewhat with the 1080 TI appearing to
take one of the smallest hits along with
the Titan XP meanwhile the fury X gained
some frames good news for all the
forward-thinking AMD users out there
rise of the Tomb Raider in DirectX 11
mode sees the 1080 Ti pull ahead of the
pack on the Intel system while it falls
slightly behind on AMD with this story
ending about the same way that Deus Ex
did with a modest performance drop in
DirectX 12 mode in for honor on the
other hand the 1080i pulls ahead on both
test bench
with the older 980ti and fury X
virtually tied at the bottom and Grand
Theft Auto 5 tells the same gangland
tale though it clearly favors the extra
threads available on Rison with a
significantly higher minimum frame rate
on that platform versus intel doom
meanwhile found the opposite was true
ripping and tearing with fewer threads
and placing our 1080 TI in both tests
within the margin of error of the Titan
XP rounding out our game tests then is
Crysis 3 which seems to perform about on
par between our platforms and exactly
the same on our rise in bench 3dmark
pitches in for our synthetic benchmarks
here finding the 1080 Ti at the top of
the pile in both fire strike ultra and
time spy and our rise in bench
performing better overall thanks to 3d
mark favoring higher core counts over
per thread performance at least to a
point the 1080 TI matches our tight
necks peas thermals pretty closely which
in spite of Nvidia's marketing about two
times larger airflow path which doesn't
really work that way is no surprise
given that it runs the same DP 102 GPU
and is rated at the same 250 watt TDP we
found that it idled slightly warmer than
the Titan XP while at full burn it
maintained 85 degrees at 2300 223 85
megahertz on the core thanks to GPU
boost 2.0 ok then
so clearly the 1080 Ti is a powerful
card they let $700 like it freaking
better be more importantly is it a good
value well compared to the Titan XP it
certainly is
but then again what wouldn't be so how
does it hold up against the rest of our
test stable well to find out we've
compiled the average FPS for each of our
game tests then divided the available
cards by their brand new price or the
unavailable ones by the going rate on
eBay as well as the last price we can
find for them new so on both test
benches
the 1080 TI FPS per dollar works out to
about point zero eight four very similar
actually a little better than the gtx
ten eighty TI with the 980 TI and the
fury x both looking great if you're
buying them used but definitely not as
good if you go by what we used to have
to pay for that kind of performance
which I suppose gives us our conclusion
then at $6.99 us the 1080 TI is only
cheap if you wipe your butt with AMD rx
for 80s and game on a recreation of the
compensator 2.0 but it trades blows with
the Titan XP as the fastest video card
we've ever seen and more importantly it
actually holds its own when it comes to
FPS per dollar to not perhaps compared
to lower tier products like the
aforementioned our X 480 but certainly
among other top-tier GPUs which is
pretty cool if you want to have a
beautiful website for only $12 a month
