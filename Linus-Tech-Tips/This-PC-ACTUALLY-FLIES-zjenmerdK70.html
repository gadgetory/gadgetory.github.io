twofold
one we wanted to build a PC for Luke at
his new job at floatplane Media Inc that
really reflects the values of that
company which is fly or float so we
obtained this literal actual flow plane
and then source of inspiration number
two was actually a video that I did a
little while ago building a PC inside
one of Lee and Lee's cases that looks
like a boat the only problem with that
case was that when I tried to actually
quote it the thing sank and I was like
you know what no no no - Media Group can
do better than Lee and Lee - Media
Group's
airplane PC is actually gonna freakin
fly so I tasked Alex here resident
engineering wizard who I never give
enough time money or tools to with
coming up with a flyable floatplane PC
and that's exactly what he theoretically
did we're about to find out co√±o is
excited to introduce the hex gears x1
keyboard a low-profile Bluetooth
mechanical keyboard with multi device
connectivity and a beautifully machined
aluminum case check it out at the link
below
inside my beaver you're gonna find my
cockpit and then there's actually two
passenger seats back there so we're
gonna rip that out
and throw in it's got to be at least
probably like a pound worth of heat
saying can Ram m2 SSD I think this is
probably a core i7 processor should be
good
before installing the computer in it we
needed to assemble and fly the plane
this would allow for us to make sure
that there were no issues with the
aircraft before we modified it but also
meant that Linus would need to take off
and land without destroying it like it's
been years since I've flown a model
airplane at all I have never flown
anything that's big and I have never
even spent any sim time with a water
plane do you want to that probably
wouldn't be a terrible idea but let's
let's get it given this is a ready to
fly kit assembly should be a pretty
simple case of following the
instructions although it quickly became
clear that there were two problems one
bad instructions is this diagram clear
to you how exactly these little wire
doodads go in here no it goes crop up no
it goes it goes straight to the big hole
but then I can't tell how you fastened
it and two people not reading those bad
instructions you have to go through the
wood on this okay this has removed plate
so probably not oh very clearly labeled
actual all right landing gear wheels on
seems pretty legit boom let's see if
it'll be able to handle coming down
about as hard as it's going to it seems
pretty strong I'm ready for insertion
whenever you are I've got I've got three
fingers in it now but it doesn't let me
get my fingers into okay oh there we go
here we go perfect where what do you
mean we're shown where's the picture of
the velcro right there
as our lack of both RC knowledge and
building ability became more clear so
did the realization that this plane may
not survive its maiden voyage this is
gonna be such a waste of money if we
just like plow it into the car we
soldiered on though completing the build
and what thanks to the beauty of video
editing was record time maybe we could
Lube it up a little bit cool so here you
push it in I'll line it up okay there we
go I'm excited we're getting closer to
our first flight yeah before flying
though
Linus wanted to try his hand in the
flight sim to brush up on his RC skills
okay whoa that was sketchy okay coming
in we're coming in Dennis get the hell
out of the way no no we're not coming in
we're not coming in get that propeller
going there no no just wait his weight
it's not gonna stop I got this I got
this
No we lost a wheel we sheared off a bolt
here and so all we got to do is find a
new a new mount for this wheel holy crap
we lived through it Oh chapter two
before putting the PC in the plane it
needed a good coating of acrylic
conformal coating from mg chemicals this
would prevent the PC from getting
damaged by small drops of water that
might end up on it during water takeoffs
and landings with that said it doesn't
make the PC completely waterproof this
is like not even it's more conformal
coating than PCB now it's like swimming
in it I mean you can't swim in a solid
but you get my point I said you do three
coats that's three coats look at these
they look so beautiful shiny it's like
plastic Ram and they still smell like
nail-polish yeah we got to test it with
the system in it that's what we're doing
right now yeah we got to get the oh wait
right test the system does the system
work testing the system gave me the
opportunity I've been waiting for so you
can see here my friends the test Kart
9000 has a convenient keyboard and mouse
right in an ergonomic keyboarding
mousing location it's got a HDMI and VGA
monitor so you cover all your bases
there yeah it's got a mouse pad for your
comfort it's got one of these little uh
who makes these again Moss cable it's
got one of these little magnetic cable
holders see that test cart technology
grab your USBs because they're
conveniently magnetically cable managed
i don't know i thought from lewis
rossmann all you need to know is that
the fan spins no then the fan isn't
spinning so let's go ahead and press the
power button there
did you break the knock oh wait no I
think it just lit up okay cool
now that we knew that nothing crucial
got covered in conformal coating we were
ready to put the PC in the plane how do
we get our PC in there so in the
backseat yeah it's like in the back
that's really gonna hurt our center of
gravity there yeah we need to put some
like weights or something up in here now
we're putting weights in the thing yeah
this thing was hard enough to fly in the
first place although we were technically
able to get the PC in through the front
window it was very difficult to access
so we needed to create a bigger opening
scalpel thank you for not putting the
blade into my finger oh this is much
sharper because the blade is thin it's
actually harder to cut in a straight
line though I guess when you're cutting
bodies it's less of a concern that you
go in a straight line maybe oh no
problem
oh oh it's so beautiful good news is our
system fits bad news is the IO does not
stick out the door the PC fit in
surprisingly well meaning we could skip
having any IO extensions and instead
just drill some holes in the side of the
plane for USB Ethernet and Thunderbolt
oh not bad not bad at all ooh okay yeah
came out clean nice oh crap
so there's the pontoon now I was trying
to widen the hole slowly and just rip
the whole thing out shoot to keep the PC
in one place we decided that the best
option was to put zip ties down through
the PCB attach a washer on the other
side then use another zip tie to tighten
it down
after installation in its super cool new
case we just needed to make sure that
the PC had survives the operation what
could we have possibly broken over the
last little bit here yes oh okay
have me freaking out a little bit there
let's see if the Wi-Fi still works
Wi-Fi still working so we managed to not
unplug that crap okay all right okay all
right the first black computer other
than all the other flying computers can
you can you see it in there yeah
whoa it's coming for you through the
computer in there well you can see the
i/o app it's kind of hard to see trust
me okay hold that gust
let's just go for it
we run away oh my god the weight the
weight the balance is uh is look way off
wha fly by oh you're gonna fly back you
know what I was actually probably wrong
to make those adjustments to the
elevator
nevermind I was right to make those
adjustments to the elevator that just
saved us no oh crap okay well - I was
trying to bring it over to the road and
the wind is good this was actually my
backup plan in case I lost confidence
and I didn't want but I was going to do
it on that side where they're kind of
taller so Wow
seems totally fine yeah I don't think we
took any damage coming into the grass
there cuz like I said I had already cut
the power you see that flies hell yeah
brother
they said it couldn't be done wait who
was the one who said it couldn't be done
that with us wasn't it Luke seems to be
on to us I called him and said we needed
to meet tomorrow for a video thing and
maybe it was I said the fact I said it
was floatplane related maybe he put two
and two together but he's like oh is it
that plane that's in the office so I
lied to him I said no it's not so we're
gonna be like haha yes it was got you
so it's last-minute preparation time we
have finally mounted the pontoons making
it properly a float plane can I hold it
up for a second and we're doing some
last-minute prep well Luke waits for us
upstairs so we're trying to get a GoPro
mounted inside the cockpit which would
be super cool like actually looking out
through the cockpit and then alex is
trying to figure out the the servos and
rubber bands and what
not that we need to hook up here we lied
to you sergeant Cole haha yes it was
shut up
we made a working flow plane it flies of
course it flies this is latest tech tips
and there is a full quad-core machine
with MDOT two SSD 32 gigs of ram and
Thunderbolt 3 inside functioning
computer functioning plane want to go
fly it yes
alright let's go so he went into the
warehouse to borrow a speaker for a
wedding yeah like a Bluetooth speaker
and he saw the plane after all those it
was like whoa that's cool and the stupid
thing is that I thought I was being so
clever telling you it's floatplane
related I know we just gave this to you
but there's a very good chance that it
will not survive the day I have never
done a water takeoff or landing and I
have only even successfully landed a
plane sort of once should we just go for
it or what the waters really still it's
nice that all these trees are around
here yeah there's one duck that's kind
of in the way they're shy kind of wait
for him to probably turn that way yeah I
want to take off directly you're away
from me though just because it's a
little easier to control sure
actually hold on hold on yeah oh yeah
he's got it run know what let's just do
it okay
all righty then
oh wow this is actually this is a very
small pond this is a much smaller Park
than I had last time
it is gusty it is gusty today if there
was any doubt that it's gusty let me set
your mind at ease about that there's
some chalk there's some chopping here no
no I'm not that low it's okay
the wind just picked me right up there
did you guys see that that was not me on
the elevator oh wow
not the smoothest landing at all the
mass drop XA k g:k 7-xx read addition
open-back headphones feature its
predecessors legendary sound and build
quality which made it a big hit with the
audiophile community and some
improvements so the highs are getting
boosted by an innovative flat wire voice
coil mids are getting brought up to
better balance the range and the lows
were raised by three decibels for a more
immersive sound this was a collaborative
design with mass drop and AKG and
includes a custom ruby red color way to
help the aesthetic really pop from the
competition it features a 10-foot
detachable cable and you can check it
out now at the link in the video
description so there you have it
the world's first flow plate no no it's
the world's first flow plane PC for a
cooi flow plane now let's make sure the
computer still works at some point but
I'm sure it's fine in first fine we just
we just tested where we came over yeah
you think so yeah we've got that I'm
glad we put the tape on though I'm
really glad to put the tape on so guys
