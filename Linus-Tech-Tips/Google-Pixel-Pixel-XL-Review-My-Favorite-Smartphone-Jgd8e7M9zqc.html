free check the link in the video
description yes it is true the long line
of Google Nexus phones has ended its
successor will be pixel which is
currently my favorite phone yeah we'll
dive into the details of that later the
pixel is a phone made by Google yet
still manufactured by someone else HTC
in this case but they weren't Google's
first choice that would have been Huawei
who bailed out because Google wouldn't
put their logo on the phone which brings
us to the design easily the most talked
about and polarizing aspect of the pixel
visually is the gorilla glass pane on
the back of the phone but it turns out
that it's not just for looks it is
intended to help with cell reception
along with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals
which is cool and if you really hate it
you can just put a scan or a case over
it anyways our Jeep brand also in the
back of the phone is a fingerprint
reader which you can also use to pull
down or put away your notification tray
with some finger flicks and maybe it's
because the last phone I reviewed was
the LG g2 but I absolutely love having
it in this position no it's not ideal
for when it's on a table but when you
pull it out of your pocket you can
unlock it in one smooth motion while
having your hand in the perfect position
ready to use it mmm so good absolutely
love that what some people are saying
isn't so good is the thickness a pixel
XL is 0.33 inches thick while an iPhone
7 plus is only 0.2 9 inches thick but to
be honest guys I really can't bring
myself to care especially when the pixel
XL is also rocking a thirty 450 million
power battery wah seriously the battery
mixed with the new software stuff which
we'll talk more about later gives me the
ability to just charge whenever I want
instead of having to constantly be
chasing down power
horses it's awesome in the time that
I've been using it there have been a
number of occasions where it has lasted
two days with no additional charging
whoo so good what's arguably even more
awesome than that is the camera which
happens to be the highest rated
smartphone camera ever it specs are darn
impressive twelve point three megapixels
F 2.0 aperture and a 1.5 five micron
pixel size along with 4k video recording
and 240 FPS slo-mo naturally I gave our
resident camera expert Brandon Lee a
spin with it and while he wasn't able to
appear on camera because he's off being
a cinematographic wizard somewhere he
did leave me with some notes lens flare
is an issue as others have noted in
their reviews however thanks to our
natural habitat being the cloudy
rainforest of southwestern British
Columbia he actually never encountered
it he described the low-light
performance as not groundbreaking per se
but said that it was very good for a
smartphone but then he was a little bit
disappointed with the lens blur
apparently iPhones implementation is
notably better as the pixel would blur
out odd parts of an image and add grainy
effects to some other images the HDR
plus mode is impressively fast but a
little overdone at times which can make
images look less natural though that's
great if that's what you're looking for
and if you're looking for more
true-to-life images you can still get
those rather easily after a few tweaks
and a photo to editor like vseo his
conclusions were that the pixel gives
detail that he never thought one could
get out of a smartphone photo and in his
subjective opinion he sees this as the
best no edit smartphone on the market
blam
that's awesome moving on we have the
hardware for both a pixel and pixel XL
you're looking at a Snapdragon 820 one
and Adreno 530 GPU four gigs of ram
neither 32 or 128 gigs of you FS 2.0
storage with the pixel specifically
you'll get a 5-inch 1080p screen with
for its size a large 20 770 million
power battery the pixel XL steps at up a
notch
with a 5.5 inch 1440p screen and that
massive battery that I mentioned earlier
all those impressive specs however might
cower in fear a little bit when they
hear that both versions have an IP water
and dust resistance rating of 53 meaning
it's somewhat splash and dust resistant
and that's it which leaves a bit to be
desired as it's quite behind the curve
compared to other modern phones even
Apple is finally rating their phones
a type II 68 that's lame Google what
isn't lame however is the software pixel
is running Android 7.1 and oh my gosh is
it smooth on this Hardware easily the
most buttery experience I have ever had
on a phone the UI just glides at your
fingertips nothing takes time everything
is effortless
even when playing games the phone
doesn't even notably heat up at all
because that might dare take away from
the experience it's glorious mmm which
makes the total flub of a speaker
implementation that much more
disappointing especially from the likes
of HTC who have ample experience with
how to do this right there are no
front-facing speakers to come on those
giant bezels where they would fit right
in Justin unfortunately easy to cover up
s sounding speaker near the USB type-c
port sad but anyways the swipe up motion
for the application tray is a little odd
at first but grows on you quick
especially if you've installed a similar
aftermarket launcher of your own in the
past it works nicely with the whole
smooth idea of the pixel and so does the
long press option that I expect many
people to overlook you can now hold your
finger on an app and it will flip up
some additional shortcut options like
incognito tab in Chrome or the take a
video option in the camera app pretty
neat then we have the Google assistant
what time is it
the time is 1141 a.m. which is a more
conversational version of Google now
which means it will remember the
previous questions that you've asked and
will be a
provide context appropriate answers to
follow-up questions without you
rephrasing the entire thing on the
surface the pixels are very good
smartphones but not necessarily perfect
ones or even great ones for that matter
it has a crappy speaker non expandable
storage bad water resistance large
bezels and it's kind of thick all of
that going along with its surprisingly
high price tag but when you use it it's
not much sort of amazing it's the
smoothest phone I have ever witnessed
the best camera in Brandon's opinion
which is good enough for me
along with incredible battery life it's
truly more than the sum of its parts and
I am super stoked for pixel to where
they can fix the speaker and water
resistance problems along with the other
things D brand is your source for
awesome vinyl skins they're available
for phones tablets laptops consoles
controllers and even more they use high
quality authentic true textured 3m vinyl
on every product and they feature
unrivaled precision
they measure many times to ensure that
they have a factory fit for your product
so it'll fit on nice and look like it
actually was supposed to come that way
the configurator is great and it allows
you to view and pick out exactly what
you want for your product not only does
your phone look great it protects
against damage and scratches as well and
they even ship worldwide you can check
them out in the link in the video
description alright guys that was my
first phone review in a long time so if
you liked it liked it and let me know
what you thought in the comments down
below I'll be reading them because I
hope to do more of these in the future I
want to review the pixel to when that
comes out if you hated it dislike the
video and leave a comment explaining why
as well so I can get better at the
things that I do if you want to buy
something like this check it out in the
amazon link in the description down
below where you will also see our shirts
in a link like slightly around that
somewhere I don't know if you want to
check out Linus's oneplus review check
