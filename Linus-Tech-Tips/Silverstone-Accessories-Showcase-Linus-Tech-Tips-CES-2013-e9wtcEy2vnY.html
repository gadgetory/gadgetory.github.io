our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys here we are in the silverstone
suite where they have a wide variety of
new stuff on display some of this is
super new some of this is super not
quite as new but we're just going to
kind of go from left to right here and
I'm gonna pick some of the highlights
that I think are really cool so this is
a case modders dream it's a dual 140
millimeter fan filter with magnet so all
you do is you've got a hole in your case
it doesn't have to be super beautiful or
anything like that you take this guy
stick it on there and it's gonna look
super clean no matter what you did any
mistakes you made or whatever else these
are an updated version of their magnetic
fan filters that use mesh that is so
fine that you actually can't really even
see it so this is gonna pick up any of
the smallest dust particles and filter
those out before they start clogging up
your system or potentially risk you know
getting buildup on something and having
a short or anything like that moving
right along
we've got this which is extremely cool
so these ones right here the black ones
are only for silverstone power supplies
and unlike other individually sleeved
cables these ones are using a braided
nylon so we're not I mean okay so yeah
you can talk about MVP see us leaving
all you want this is a significant step
above that in terms of the quality these
will be completely resistant to any kind
of cutting organic and they will just
sort of just feel nicer look nicer just
better in every possible way
they not only have the black ones for
their own power supplies but also
multiple colored ones in the form of
extensions that'll be universally
compatible even with other power
supplies there's one more neat accessory
here I want to show you guys so you have
a five and a quarter inch Bay on your
notebook okay cool you don't use your
optical drive forget about it put an SSD
in this okay it adapts the native
connector that's inside your Bay to a
two and a half inch mount and you're off
to the races you've added an SSD to your
notebook or even a second SSD at that
point now we're gonna move over
to this table here where we've got sort
of an updated line some updated products
in the treasure storage series so
they've got a tube a a small enclosure
this guy right here is USB 3 they have a
tube a larger enclosure this one
supports raid USB 3 and eSATA which
actually drives inside it right now as
well as quite heavy here very solid
construction so solid piece of aluminum
on the front brushed for our very nice
finish let's go ahead and open that up
so these you can just pop out its
totally to list you just use the handle
right there and last but not least they
have a form a version of pretty much
that one they're also getting into
mobile accessories so this is this is
cool actually this is a 7 millimeter
slim two and a half inch external drive
so you can put either a slim hard drive
or a slim SSD in there as long as it's 7
mil so I'll pull out the old iPhone
comparison here just so you guys can see
it's not that much thicker than actually
about the same as an iPhone 4 and then
in terms of the size this way it's not
that much bigger so very very convenient
very rugged because it's made out of
what appears to be a solid piece of
aluminum around the outside here so very
very whoops very strong once you do up
the screws they've also got a couple of
mobile charging accessories so this is
kind of neat because it takes double-a
batteries I mean yeah there's solar
charging ones there's ones that you
charge over USB but it's there's
something to be said for the convenience
of being able to say oh crap I can't
charge my thing I have nothing I have no
access to a wall outlet but I can go buy
some batteries or I carry double-a
batteries with me or whatever else so
there's a two battery one as well as a
for battery version of that available
we're gonna wrap up this clip of the
silverstone suite with a couple of cases
here so we recently did a video on the
NCIX type tech tips channel of the SGO 9
well this is the SG 10 which is
basically the same case a very
innovative case very compact case takes
for two and a half inch drives two three
and a half inch drives to dual slot
graphics cards an M ATX motherboard up
to like a thousand watt power supply or
whatever you can fit in a standard ATX
huge tower cooler it's a very very well
engineered case and what they've done is
they've taken the plastic bezel off of
it and they've added a more silver stone
looking aluminum and mash bezel that is
much more in line with sort of the
design styling that I'd expect from them
the way that things stay cool enough in
a chassis like this is there's actually
fans built into the side panel and a
very large air penetrator fan on the top
that forces air into the chassis and it
should be filtered I don't know where
the top of this is but I'm quite certain
that it's filtered so of courses are
into the chassis while keeping dust out
of it
and if you've heard of intel's new
platform this is the PTU 13 so that's
their their super low power sort of
highly integrated platform so check this
out
the board has an integrated power supply
right here power in AC no big deal okay
and then it adapts that to our spa that
you need it's art you need a power
adapter to go into here so it's a DC to
DC power supply so it's got things like
SATA power output trying to get you a
better angle on that so you can plug in
your single Drive which is going to sit
right up here on the lid you've got two
SATA data connectors and silverstone has
a special cooler for it that also is
able to keep the CPU cool as well
there's a PCIe 4x slot on this
particular Intel board but I don't know
if you'd be able to use it but the point
of this is not necessarily maximum
expandability to of sodium slots as well
as an M SATA slot here as well as mini
PCIe for wireless so it's not
necessarily extendibility but more just
to do with the size so in this case we
have a full computer excluding the
external power supply that is basically
in the form factor that we would have
seen a five and a quarter inch external
optical drive only a few short years ago
