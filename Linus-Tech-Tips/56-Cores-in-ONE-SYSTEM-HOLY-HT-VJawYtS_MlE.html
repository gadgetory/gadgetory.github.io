crazy core account system so Intel sent
over this care package with some bananas
stuff in it so we've got an entire tray
I mean technically it is an entire tray
even if it's only 60% full of actual
things of their new Zeon W chips for
workstations
we've got oho this one's really good
their top-of-the-line 28
core processor that's the Xeon 8180 and
another one they sent to these are
unrelated they're cool too though
so that's 56 cores on a single
motherboard there are only two words to
adequately describe this kind of speed
holy today's video is brought to you by
Origin PC Origin PC offers beautiful
custom desktops high performance laptops
in lifetime 24/7 technical support they
only use high quality products like
samsung's 960 pro m2 SSDs and you can
visit Origin PC at the link below to
learn more
now Intel has come under fire over the
last number of years for their CPU
innovation is dead let's call it a
passive approach to bringing more cores
to the mainstream consumer but this is
not so in the enterprise space where
supercomputing and the cloud have driven
demand for CPUs with ever higher core
counts and with customers who are ready
to pay for the engineering involved in
creating them so in the last five years
we've gone from the 26.97 v2 that's a 12
core to this this is the Xeon Platinum
8180 28 cores in here that is over
double the core count in less than five
years each one of these chips can
support up to 768 gigabytes of memory
the M variant can actually do 1.5
terabytes
each and is equipped with 48 PCI Express
Lanes a whopping 6 channels of ddr4 2666
memory each so this is 12 sticks here
we're going to be using all of these and
three qpi links for high-speed
communication in multi chip
configurations with up to four of them
being able to communicate directly to
each of the others but all of that comes
at a cost
Intel has been forced to use a
significantly larger socket like
physically larger with many more pins
and what that means is that there will
be zero interoperability between these
high-end server chips and prosumer or
workstation B base single socket or dual
socket motherboards like we've enjoyed
for the last few generations hold on a
second is this gonna be a problem always
want to defy expectations a seuss has
created something truly special for all
the folks out there that disagree with
Intel's
so let's then have a look at the WS see
621 a sage it has quite literally
everything
I mean it's oozes engineers don't seem
to have stressed out too much about the
question of is it necessary it's got
support for for you dot two drives who
puts for you dot two drives in a system
so we got two 36:47 sockets we've got
twelve memory slots like look at how
much of this board is dedicated to just
memory and CPU sockets it's got a
microSD slot because I don't know maybe
you want to run some like Linux distro
off of micro sd seven PCI Express 16x
slots with three of them wired up at 8 X
it's got a VGA header can't go wrong
with that
I guess now all that's really left is to
put it together and maybe run some
benchmarks I am SuperDuper not a fan of
this socket the retention mechanism is
you not to put a heatsink on top of it
and screw it down which is terrifying
because in 100% of cases so far I have
had the suction of the thermal compound
lift the CPU out at the same time now
the conventional wisdom when it comes to
thermal compound is generally less is
more but if we're being realistic
you know these coolers weren't gonna
help me break any overclocking records
anyway these were the only things I
could find with compatibility with the
square ilm design versus the narrow one
that were also readily available
although Swift tech did up a couple of
custom blocks for this socket almost no
one else is even talking about support
for the socket yet oh it's heavy
56 processing cores
now we've got to keep it fed with data I
mean that's one of the big design
concerns every time is how are you going
to keep that thing fed so what I'm
installing right now from Kingston top
of the line as far as server memory
speed goes so these are 26 66 megahertz
and a whopping 6
channels per CPU it is an effective six
x√¨ng of the total memory bandwidth per
CPU oh it's even more beautiful
assembled 56 course 384 gigabytes of
memory and that amount was actually
chosen for a pretty specific reason so
you guys are probably familiar with the
seven gamers one CPU project where we
had seven discrete gaming rigs running
off of a single motherboard
when we did that we were using 18 core
CPUs and I kind of went okay 36 course
well now we've got so many that if we
were to do six workstations like 8k
video editing workstations each one of
them could have like up to nine cores
per video editing system like that is
enough for a bonafide workstation so I
would consider an 8 core 64 gig
workstation we're gonna try and find
some single slot cards so everyone gets
a dedicated GPU I would consider that a
very capable workstation and I want the
whole thing powered off of a single
motherboard okay we're in dare me to
enable the turbo ratio lock to keep the
processor operating at the turbo highest
frequency for the maximum perform what
does that even mean you guys means make
it go more faster let's try it it's
funny people would always ask me back
when I used a raid card running 8 SSDs
and raid zero for my boot drive people
always ask me oh how fast are your boot
times it was not about boot time SSDs
were never about boot time it was always
about speed once you're booted so I
don't want to deal with the amount of
screeching that I would have to deal
with if I don't immediately fire up
Cinebench speaking of which okay okay
people have asked me for examples of
this
the terribleness of the windows search
see ok that'll make sense
I sure okay not really sure how we're
getting there
Oh sin that milky now I can get
Cinebench but watch this watch this
bee it's gone here we go whoa look at
that turbo speed just shy of the 7000 in
Cinebench that is 56 course 112 threads
let's see it again my friends what it's
like it's warmed up or something I came
up with something that will let us hit
it hard for an extended period when you
mine
burst coin you have to do something
called plotting so I'm gonna run six
instances of the plotting software to
see how much we can make it scream 100%
utilization at 2.9 gigahertz so
somewhere between a hundred and fifty
thousand and two hundred thousand nonces
per minute which if you're into burst
point you will know is pretty freakin
impressive for anything that is not a
GPU obviously though this isn't the only
thing we're gonna run on these things
let us know in the comments below what
kind of loads do you want to see run cuz
we're gonna have a full video following
this one up soon so what can it handle
what can't it handle we're here to
satisfy your curiosity and satisfy you
in other ways
like by telling you about ting the
mobile carrier that makes sense with
King you get to talk to an actual person
if you ever have to call their customer
support for any reason go figure
and you don't even have to pay extra for
the privilege with King the average bill
is just $23 a month per device and
they've got new lower data rates just
$10 a gig past the first gig so why wait
pay for only what you use try out the
ting savings calculator at Linus ENCOM
we're gonna have that link below and
find out how much you would save so
thanks for watching guys if you just
like this video you can hit that button
but if you liked it hit like yet
subscribe maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured at
the link in the video description like
unless you're running a data center or
like building a new supercomputer it
seems kind of unlikely but hey you never
know while you're down there you can
check out our merch storage has cool
t-shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
