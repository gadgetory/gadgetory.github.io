actually have to buy a smart TV in order
to turn your TV into a smart TV so this
is the pebbles zo sore xios ex iOS I
mean they're really into things that are
tough to pronounce when it comes to
their product name still this is the
second product in their media player mix
so they do media player boxes there
other one is the AOS which i think i'm
pronouncing right as well this is still
the powerhouse this is still the tank
this one is running completely custom
firmware and it's not using any kind of
you know android or XBMC or anything
like that at all this guy on the other
hand is running Android Ice Cream
Sandwich which with the new XBMC
available for Android can run XBMC over
top of Android or there's actually a
native firmware that you can flash
directly to XBMC so you can be running
XBMC natively off of this tiny tiny
little device that you have to basically
just kind of stash somewhere near your
TV check that out so let's have a look
at speeds and feeds before we have
whoops before we take a closer look at
the physical aspect of using this
they're off now it's out of my way thank
you comes with a fairly rudimentary
remote okay comes with power brick okay
I'll look Victor on an hdmi cable too
that's nice alright so what did they
have to say for themselves so number one
okay supports a bunch of video codecs
this is a very experienced team so it's
going to support all of the important
stuff including you know your rmvb for
your agent shows and all that all that
good stuff what's in the box we've
already seen supported connectivity will
definitely see system requirements so
1080p resolution is fully supported and
very very good a wireless is included
with this device you can see right here
wireless-n is included it also has 10
underneath or net and I would usually
recommend using ten hundred Ethernet
where possible but if you have good
signal strength wireless-n will do the
trick for you it also supports a micro
sdhc card up to 32 gigs and that is
pretty much all it has to say for itself
in that regard so here this is an older
box actually because it's running Ice
Cream Sandwich already with the newer
units that are shipping okay that we've
already covered supports a wide range of
peripherals including pebbles sent
wireless motion remote this one which
yeah isn't the same as the one that came
in the box so this is a motion-sensing
remote that I haven't actually used yet
so move slight point and click and I'm
really looking forward to trying this
this is an optional accessory whereas
the xios comes with just the basic
remote okay keyboard mouse webcam card
readers digital cameras many more comes
with an ARM Cortex a9 so a fairly
powerful processor 512 megs of ram two
gigs nand flash although you can expand
the storage and you can always also
expand the storage via USB 2 okay
powered by android yep okay the marriage
between the digital home the ultra slim
form factor and pretty much it so let's
have a look at the unit itself very
clean very cool styling xios TS media
play on the front you find basically an
IR receiver you've got a few indicator
LEDs on the side you find your microsd
for storage to usb2 ports on the back
you've got a lan port another USB to
port hdmi DC voltage in and a power
button and on the side you basically got
not a hole so the main advantage with
any media player that you buy or not the
main advantage the main consideration
always has to be how well are they going
to support it soap Evos has shown with
the AOS that they are willing to launch
a product put it in the marketplace
honestly at first there were a fair
number firmware bugs but these days
speaking as you know a retailer you know
my work at NCIX these days so all i er
no they took care of it so the AOS runs
really well now zayas has some bugs you
know that's to be expected however kalos
is very committed to upgrades in fact
they even have a dedicated Upgrade
button right on the bottom so the cool
thing about up
getting this thing to ice cream sandwich
is that it's really meant to be run on a
big screen so there's a fully functional
Google Play Store which means that all
you have to do is sync all the apps from
your Android device no learning curve
whatsoever and all of a sudden you've
got everything that you want running on
your TV as well as on your tablet or
smartphone so that means you've got all
that cool stuff that comes with using an
open platform like you know Skype and
Twitter and all that good stuff in fact
it supports webcams I think we covered
that very briefly before but that's a
cool thing because lots of smart TVs
they want you to buy like their webcam
in order to run skype on your Smart TV
and it's like you know 100 / dollars
well okay or you can just buy cheap
webcam and a bios for pretty much the
same price and then you could run skype
on your TV and you can have all these
other advantages as well it also has
support for chrome which is pretty cool
given that it's only running ice cream
sandwich at this time you know you can
play HD youtube with all of the correct
apps and all that so maybe flick could
look at the accessories for a second and
all that PVR functionality with
supported USB tuners you can run games
such as angry birds without any
difficulty there's a few limitations so
the included remote isn't that great
it's just basic functionality however
this sense one which we should actually
open up just you know as an exercise in
opening boxes because that's what we
apparently do on this channel so it
comes with a USB charging cable mini USB
receiver dongle that you will probably
plug in to this nice low-profile and
Pipo since wireless motion remote so
there you go so you have the option of a
more robust remote control system as
well and okay right so limitations
there's no HD audio bin streaming but
down mixing does work fine there's some
issues with youtube app switching
between full and window screen but these
are things that can potentially be
worked on in the future there's also the
fact that there's no multi-channel audio
pass through but DTS and dolby digital
5.1 will be enabled by a firmware update
down mixing
works fine so what's the summary
basically this thing is not meant to
replace the AOS and the pebbles lineup
but it's meant to be more of like a
smart smart TV experience augmentation
creator thing as opposed to being like
like a powerhouse media box so I'm
really excited to try it out and I hope
you guys are excited to sort of tune in
