at the blackberry playbook and the first
thing I'm going to do with the playbook
is I'm going to click to play I'm on fat
pi calm
I actually really like fat pi calm and
I've got one of his videos playing this
is a flash video and it is playing it's
already in a lot of ways better than
this for my purposes okay so I'm just
gonna go ahead and I'm going to own a
bus okay go ahead and pause that I don't
have a box for this product today so I
can't really do an unboxing sorry I
can't really I can't really do this from
the from this way so I don't really have
a box so I can't do an unboxing today
but I'm gonna be doing a quick product
tour and just an overall quick overview
of the BlackBerry PlayBook which so far
I am very impressed with so here's my
big buck bunny video that I usually play
to show HD YouTube playback and it is
sorry it's really hard to use this from
the single it is phenomenal full screen
HD video playback is absolutely flawless
completely smooth without any tweaking
or playing around with it whatsoever I'm
very very impressed if we can skip
forward to sort of a more action-packed
scene in the in the show that might help
a little bit to demonstrate the
smoothness internet browsing is very
very snappy so far it does feature a
dual dual-core 1 gigahertz processor so
that's not that unexpected the touch
screen here is 7-inch and it is able to
use four fingers concurrently for its
multi-touch interface and yeah skipping
in HD videos on YouTube isn't always
super smooth visit come on you can do it
YouTube that's it doesn't want to do it
for me okay fine forget it the overall
interface is very very neat so you have
to actually be on the touch sensitive
screen you've also got a touch sensitive
frame so depending where you dragged in
onto the screen from it'll actually give
you a variety of different
functionalities so
I can access my menus so this is where I
can do things like connect to Wi-Fi
which I am connected to right now I can
control my HDMI output yes it has micro
HDMI as well as usb on the bottom and
then this is for a dedicated charging
dock actually let's finish off with the
hardware here so it's available in 16
gig 32 gig and 64 gig configurations it
has stereo speakers on either side of
the screen which is an improvement over
other tablets on the market which have
their speakers at the bottom for
whatever reason and this one seems to
only one speaker I haven't actually done
too much research on the iPad 2 so
forgive me on the top you find a couple
of dedicated hardware buttons including
power volume and play pause as well as a
headphone jack you've got a front-facing
a 3 megapixel camera as well as a back
facing five megapixel camera which is
also capable of capturing HD video let's
see what else do I want to say it has
Bluetooth tethering with other with
other devices so you can actually access
internet on here as if you use something
else to tether to your 3G connection or
whatever the case may be overall
smoothness so I'm going to show you guys
this just everything is incredibly
smooth when you rotate it's not like a
Windows tablet where it's like this
clunky three-second delay if you bring
this stuff you bring this up whatever
whatever you happen to be doing
everything is very smooth so let's say I
want to navigate to my other now it's
playing again that's ok oh yeah oh
that's interesting
ok I don't know how that works but
apparently I minimized it so it'll take
some getting used to in order to really
get the hang of the full functionality
of it here I'm at the desktop though so
I can see all favorites media games this
one doesn't have any games installed on
it this is just a demo unit that I have
on hand for about 20 minutes here while
I try to put together a video but like I
said overall just wicked smooth
interface very very impressed with that
aspect of the BlackBerry PlayBook I'm
holding it upside down right now and I
realize let's go back to YouTube I just
want to show you guys how quick the
browsing is on this little guy here so
let's go to oh I love the keyboard by
the way and cix whoops see I'm not used
to a couple of the features yet love the
keyboard and part of the reason I love
the keyboard so much is just the fact
that here we go there's no 21 no 120
Hertz Oh No there's no 120 Hertz now
we're gonna go back now we're gonna see
something else we go you know banners on
the side let's have a look at the NC
exhale browsing is very snappy very very
impressed with that aspect of it oh yeah
here's something neat so let's say I
wanted to go to a different web ID let's
say I wanted to go to Easter 2011 I can
actually unlike iOS I can navigate to
some anywhere in my URL I know Android
does this as well but personally I find
that a boon as an iPhone 4 user that I
can edit text without actually going
back and retyping the entire sequence
there was something I wanted to say give
me a sec so let's do a little bit more
functionality so here this is the word
to go app so I can type hello world I
actually really like the keyboard and I
did mention this before but I didn't say
why because the size of the device is
just about right so I can actually type
with my thumb's like I would on a
touchscreen phone without it being
awkward and uncomfortable the way it
would on a larger tablet where you
basically here I'll show you guys the
the iPad 2 for comparison so on a larger
tablet like this let's go and try to
make a note of some sort it's making you
note I like I can't really do this
comfortably and it loses a little bit of
functionality for someone like me that
way let's actually have a look let's do
a quick physical comparison so here's
the size of the BlackBerry PlayBook
compared to the iPad our iPad 2 rather
okay here is the thickness
okay so it is a touch thicker but it's
actually not that much thicker and this
is something another thing that I
actually quite like its square like the
iPhone 4 as opposed to being beveled at
the edges like the iPad 2 and like the
the older iPhones and that actually
allows me to hold on to it better I find
my fingers are less likely to slip off
it from the back and I personally prefer
that let's just show you guys the
multitasking really quick so why don't
we open up something else so we've got a
browser open let's go to all at sea
let's open Adobe Reader or something so
here's the multitasking functionality we
go like this we can switch between our
browser we can switch between our word
to go where we can type things and the
the interfaces is impressively snappy I
really really like that aspect of it I
already talked about the micro HDMI or
you talked about that yeah ok you know
what let's go back and give Big Buck
Bunny another chance
so youtube.com it really is so fast ok
and I'll show you guys when we start at
the beginning how quickly I'm able to
get into playing 1080p HD video
fullscreen here there we are
so the browsing I was doing before
wasn't really properly indicative but
you can see there's absolutely no frame
skipping whatsoever here love it it
comes with 90 days of free tech support
I don't know if I mentioned that already
but if you're having trouble using it
you can call in for free and and get
help with it they've also got some
pretty neat guides on their website
where they walk you through a lot of the
different aspects you know how to type
properly on it how to get started
connecting your Wi-Fi how to use the app
store and I think that pretty much
covers everything I wanted to say about
it why don't we use the camera real
quick here and just try it out we'll do
a little bit of video capture shall we
so I'm using the rear mounted camera so
let's up here actually why don't we why
don't we catch for me am I am i aiming
at myself am i doing it am i doing
I can't tell I should go this way this
way let's plate down okay well whatever
okay I'm basically here I'm talking to
myself through the 3d blackberry
playbook we're gonna go ahead and stop
that and then let's just so this is
really intuitive now took me forever how
to figure out how to minimize something
but now that I'm now that I'm doing it
it's like no problem whatsoever so let's
go to my videos and we've got the one
that I just is this the one I just took
must be let's just play it that's really
good crazy Russians trying to show me
where it appointed fantastic okay well
thank you for checking out my quick
product tour of the BlackBerry PlayBook
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos actually one more
size comparison for you guys before we
wrap up here so here it is next to the
iPad 2 and I also happen to have in a
soos transformer tablet that I can put
next to it as well just so that you guys
have some good context for the size and
thickness of these devices so the
playbook if you come down on this angle
you see the playbook is actually very
similar to the iPad 2 the transformer is
a little bit thicker and then I'm just
gonna throw my iphone down on the table
just for context there as well the
iPhone 4 is just a touch and right in
between the iPad 2 and the BlackBerry
PlayBook okay now I'm actually done
don't forget to subscribe guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
