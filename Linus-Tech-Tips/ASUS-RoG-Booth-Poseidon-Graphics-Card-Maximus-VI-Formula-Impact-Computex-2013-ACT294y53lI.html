XCOM welcome to our OG the only thing
missing here is jayjay because they have
an unbelievable amount of cool tech on
display this right here is a gtx 770
Riis card it is which is usually a good
sign at a very cool thing and this
cooler design is called their cool tech
fan so it actually has an enormous fin
array that's that not all of it is even
visible to us right now but it's okay
because there's an exploded one over on
the right it also has a hybrid cooler
design that is able to do both air
cooling and see those right there those
are G 1/4 fittings this bad boy can be
liquid cooled as well so let's move over
to the right here where we can see the
way that the design of the card actually
works so they've got a jg + v RM with s
AP completely custom card over there so
the idea is that ok we got a custom PCB
design that gives us more efficient
cooling more efficient power delivery so
that you're not going to have any excess
heat to get rid of then you throw a
cooler at it that can get rid of all the
excess heat anyway so that's the direct
Cu h2o with their cool tech fan and
they're claiming up to 10 degrees better
than reference just when your air
cooling it and finally of course it's an
ROG product so there's a sweet-looking
shroud on it now let's move over to this
is this is sort of what's really
interesting about this so up to 20
degrees cooler with a liquid cooling
setup versus a reference cooler which
you can see here is using full custom
fittings this is one of the few things
that I criticize about some of the
previous asus liquid cooling capable
products was the fact that they had
built-in Barb's and they were too small
and you know most enthusiasts weren't
gonna want to use that now you can okay
the to the tubing itself within the card
it's quite restrictive you can actually
see it's very narrow but at least you
can hook up whatever fittings you want
and you can actually liquid cool your
CPU with an aftermarket block this right
here is a
Maximus six formula which has built-in
liquid cooling and then you've got the
Poseidon card which has built in liquid
cooling as well now right now it's all
over a test bench but trust me when you
put this in your system it's gonna look
pretty freakin sweet and our og
motherboards they just keep pushing the
envelope don't they now we first saw
this with the deluxe class z77 ITX
performance motherboard that has been
stepped up a notch with the Maximus vi
impact this features the full array of
rog features so you got their supreme FX
latest generation technology which has
to check this out this is really cool
so you get a visual indicator of where
sounds are coming from in-game at all
times so if the actions in front of you
you're gonna be able to see that if it's
behind you you're gonna be able to see
that as an indicator you've also got an
incredibly compact power delivery design
that won't be a that move so let's just
kind of try to look up here so much like
the last generation board which was only
a channel series deluxe board this has a
riser PCB because there wasn't enough
room in the ITX form factor to fit all
of the power delivery and all the
features that they wanted to on this
particular board this is a z87 board so
you've got full support for the latest
fourth generation has well processors
and the way that they've got these
boards demoed is actually phenomenally
cool so there's gigantic thermal write
coolers on them that not only cool the
CPU but also the memory and the vrm as
well as the generally the PCB of the
board itself and they're showing off
their direct Cu mini GTX 670 this is a
short PCB card allowing it to be used in
all kinds of creative configurations
with the with that said let's move over
to the left here where we're gonna see
something very unique so this is a high
performance machine running on a cool
little ROG pedestal here similar
configuration except check this out
wears a graphics card whatever sorry
what the graphics card is on the bottom
on the back with the power supply I'm
gonna turn this around so you guys can
see it check that out so you've got an
SFX power supply as well as a ribbon
cable that runs from the PCI Express
slot all the way under this over to this
GTX 670 graphics card so this is what
I'm
about it being a modders dream and
enabling all kinds of cool new form
factors without compromising anything in
terms of performance so Gary from a soos
has actually dug up a bear board that we
can show you guys rather than the one
that was on the build now the reason
that we want to see it in all of its
gorgeous glory is that you can't really
was covered in a big heat sink and you
couldn't really see some of the unique
technologies that went into it so it's
an ITX form factor so when I say a soos
was wanted to deliver everything you get
in a standard rog board then I mean that
was a real challenge so one of the
things that you could sort of see before
was the raised PWM so this is the
voltage regulation modules and all that
good stuff this is where the power goes
from something that your power supply
outputs to something that a CPU and all
the other components on here can use so
there wasn't room for that there also
isn't room realistically on an ITX board
for a proper sound solution so that's
where a soos did their usual thing where
they upped the ante and they built an
actual external PCB that's just for the
impact board that goes right here so
that way you can get high-quality gaming
great audio without having to sacrifice
the one expansion slot that you usually
end up having will always end up having
on a mini ITX board the last thing that
you couldn't really get a clear look at
before was the EM PCIe combo - so this
supports the m-dot - standard which will
allow you to plug drives in and also
known as ng FF which will allow you to
plug drives in directly without using up
one of your SATA ports because it is an
MITx board
you only have four of them and I think
that's pretty much it now you guys can
really get a closer look at what makes
this truly ROG DNA but in a much smaller
form factor thanks Gary you're welcome
this is what I love about these shows
there's all kinds of stuff here that
actually doesn't exist this is the front
base which unlike the OC panel which
we've already seen on the Maximus six
extreme completely designed for
overclocking you can adjust base clock
by increments of 0.1 you can monitor
temperatures down to sub-zero all kinds
of cool stuff you can do with that
is more optimized for gamers so it's
more like that that higher level control
so you want to be able to do things like
monitor your CPU frequency your fan RPMs
I think we were playing around with this
before and I messed it up but don't
worry too much about that you can
monitor your CPU temperatures your time
but that's not really it because there's
other cool stuff that they want to
enable through this that this thing that
doesn't exist yet so number one is
there's gonna be a one button
overclocking method so you click the
button CPU level up which already exists
on the motherboard is enable turns your
CPU speed up next thing they're gonna be
enabling is game recording button so if
you're a gamer who's into gameplay
videos Let's Plays any kind of cool
thing like that all you got to do is
press the record button which is going
to be right here and I'm sure there'll
be a way to trigger it through software
or whatever else as well and you can get
that going as well last but not least it
integrates perfectly with a Souza's
onboard audio solutions and they want to
have a way for you to actually select
different audio profiles simply using
the dial on the front of your case
rather than fussing about in the driver
now of course not everyone's an extreme
overclockers and there was a there was a
maximus 6 extreme over hooked up to the
OC panel and all that stuff but this is
the formula this is optimized for gaming
as opposed to pure overclocking so
they've got rog armor now that they've
implemented not only on the saber-tooth
series but also on their rog series now
it doesn't necessarily contribute a
whole lot to the actual cooling of the
board but what it does do is it
increases the rigidity of the board when
its installed in the case so it's got a
top piece as well as a backplate that
asus has validated to not cause
interference with your case so you
should still have excellent case
compatibility they've completely
redesigned it completely rethought the
way that they do motherboard cooling as
well so check this out this is the cross
shield thermal design the only complaint
I had about the integrated liquid
cooling on the Maximus 5 formula was the
fact that it did not have replaceable
Barb's they have addressed that so now
they're using standard G 1/4 fitting
mounts so you can see here
there's some just random Swift tech
compression fittings that they're using
there are as no weird interference
points or anything like that this looks
like it was designed by a water cooling
company so you're supposed to touch here
and touch here but you guys obviously al
won't be able to do that because you
know it's video so check this out you
can actually look at their OC panel
right here which is taking temperature
readings from the liquid cooled side and
the air cooled side so there's heat
loads under these and it's about 20
degrees cooler with liquid cooling
versus air cooling now let's talk about
the new supreme FX se soos is really
driving the industry forward when it
comes to onboard audio I personally hate
onboard audio but the one on board audio
solution that I'll accept is from Asus
because they take a separated dedicated
part of the PCB and they put audio
quality components on it this is what
everyone refused to do for years and
they have dramatically upgraded even the
redline audio that we already saw in the
Maximus 5 formula so check this out
you're getting Elna premium audio
capacitors why am i film caps I don't
even understand half the stuff but the
point is that they are taking the
engineering that went into products like
zonar and adding it directly to their
motherboards
this guy right here is a dedicated
headphone amp and that's I can certainly
tell you a larger headphone amp than
I've ever seen on any other on any other
motherboard it can handle up to 600 ohm
impedance headphones and I don't see
where it is right now but there's a
cirrus logic cs4 t3 98 DAC asus is
claiming up to a hundred and twenty
decibels sound to noise ratio on this
board now that's not to say that
features have to look bad this is what a
soos is expecting you to build with a
motherboard like the Maximus 6 formula
so you can see here the integrated
liquid cooling that we've got on the
motherboard back there it's using bits
power fittings for these extremely clean
and beautiful cable runs you've got a
red liquid that's running around - it
appears to be probably a GTX Titan would
be my assumption but I'm not able to
tell because there's an e K backplate
covering the entire card right there now
the one thing I'd say is missing
this as a high-end build normally as a
dedicated sound card such as a Phoebus
but you actually are getting to the
point now where you can get onboard
audio that is as good as high-end
dedicated on a motherboard if you spend
the extra on ROG board for me personally
not being an extreme overclocker I'd be
looking at an ROG formula board as
opposed to an extreme even though it's
actually less expensive thank you for
