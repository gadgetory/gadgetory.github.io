more welcome to my 1080p performance
review of the geforce gtx 780 from
nvidia this comes in and replaces the
geforce gtx 680 and is positioned
slightly below the geforce gtx titan in
terms of performance spoiler alert but
significantly below the geforce gtx
titan which is a $1000 card in terms of
price our testing methodology is pretty
straightforward we always overclock all
of our cards you can find our
overclocking results in the spreadsheet
that is in the video description if you
want to check it out and we are using
fraps because we don't have a frame
rating capture setup yet but we're
hoping to add something like that in the
future we are only testing single GPU
setups however so the discrepancies
between fraps and a capture setup are
not nearly as significant as they are in
particularly crossfire configurations
our testbed is our usual testbed we've
got a 39 60 X behind me at 4 gigahertz
16 gigs of ram a p90x 79 deluxe
motherboard a 128 gig SSD powered by an
antic high current Pro 1000 watt and
cooled by a corsair h 100 we're running
Windows 7 still for our test platform
just because that is the way we wanted
to do it for our drivers we're doing
something we don't usually do and we are
using the latest beta drivers from both
Nvidia and AMD this is giving us the
latest performance enhancements and
what's kind of cool about what you're
about to see is that there have been
some changes in terms of rankings so
we've done performance guides featuring
some of these graphics cards on some of
these games where the results are
different than what you're going to see
now so remember guys beta drivers are
non finalized and there can be weird
bugs and glitching us which is why we
try to avoid using them for performance
reviews but what you're about to see is
more of a glimpse into how they perform
like exactly now or even a little bit
into the future now we're almost to the
point where we're talking performance
numbers but I want to talk about some of
the things that make this card special
besides performance it shares a lot with
the GTX Titan it uses the same gk110
core it uses the same cooler
an updated acoustic profile meaning that
the fan doesn't spin up and down
unnecessarily it maintains things very
steadily it also has GPU boost a 2.0
which allows you to do really cool stuff
like you can either say okay
temperatures be damned I want you to run
at the highest performance possible I'm
okay with 90 degrees on my GPU or and it
will perform better or you can say you
know what I want my card to run really
cool I'm only comfortable 270 degrees
and the card will dynamically turn
itself down in terms of voltages and
clock speeds to stay within that target
that you've determined now it doesn't
have six gigs of RAM like the GTX Titan
but it does use the same PCB so you got
support for all the Nvidia technologies
sli 2-way 3-way 4-way Nvidia 3d vision
Nvidia 3d visions surround with three
surround displays plus an auxiliary
display and the fact that it uses the
same PCB means we've got a very be fully
designed card that should be great for
overclocking and once we overclocked
these cards you're going to see the
performance is very similar the one
thing that's missing on the back of the
card here and why I have it turned
around is an additional three gigs of
memory this card has three gigs versus
the six gigs of memory on the GTX Titan
let's start with Metro last light and we
are cranking the details on all the
games for this video because these are
high-end cards and if you're spending
300 plus dollars on a card you better be
turning up the details this is where we
see how our overclocked methodology
really reveals the the lesser price to
performance value of some of the
higher-end cards when you're
overclocking everything so the GTX 780
performs almost the same as a Titan and
a 7950 outperforms almost the same as a
7970 only the gtx 660ti really falls
behind in this particular test in
BioShock Infinite we see about a 10%
performance advantage over the 780 going
to the Titan with the Titan o performing
everything and the 780 outperforming
everything else however I'd like to take
a moment while you enjoy these graphs to
point out that it's about more than
performance acoustics is a huge part of
the experience particularly for silence
freaks like me and you may or may not
have noticed already that there's a
significant amount more background noise
to this particular segment of the video
compared to the rest of it and I
to see if you guys can figure out where
the problem lies in Tomb Raider we see a
bit more of a spread with the titan
outperforming the GTX 780 by about 10%
the 780 outperforming everything else by
a wide margin and then the AMD card is
nice and close to the GTX 680 and the
660ti trailing behind in Far Cry 3 we
see another example of almost identical
performance between the Titan and the
780 with the 680 falling behind
significantly clustered with those other
cars this is one of those games where
these look like next-generation cards
and everything else looks like a last
generation card in Far Cry 3 blood
dragon surprise surprise the Titans the
big winner it's $1,000 video cards so it
pretty much better win I mean it's good
that it does the 780 however is once
again only about 10 percent slower but
what's neat to see here is that in Far
Cry 3 Blood Dragon we've seen a
significant change in the way those last
generation GPUs lined up in terms of
performance so what's cool about this is
the fact that NVIDIA has the 680
literally on the way out of their
product lineup it is replaced as of
today but it is still getting driver
enhancements that are making it perform
better in these new games and again the
GTX Titan and 780 look like they don't
even belong in the same set of
benchmarks as these other cards the
three gigs of ram particularly at 1080p
doesn't seem to hold back the 780 in any
way and it performs almost as well as
the Titan about 50% better than anything
else on the field so what did we take
away from all of this the GTX 780 looks
compared to the Titan like a stunning
price to performance proposition it
performs at worst about 10% slower once
you overclocked them and guys if you're
buying GTX 780 s and not overclocking
them shame on you okay so it performs
very close to a Titan and cost
significantly less than a Titan with all
that cool Titan feature stuff that goes
on and even the illuminated GeForce GTX
logo that you can set up to breathe or
you can increase the brightness when
it's under a gaming load and all kinds
of cool stuff like that is included on
this card at a significantly lower price
now with all of that said it doesn't
just come down to price to performance
ray
and this is particularly of note when
you look at the competition now normally
I don't talk about game bundles in these
videos because I don't know if that game
bundles still going to exist six months
down the line when you might be watching
this but it AMD has had the never settle
bundle running for almost six months now
which means that I better talk about it
because they are serious about this you
may or may not have noticed that a lot
of the games the 7970 did not perform
the GTX 780 not by a longshot but what's
kind of neat about it is a lot of those
games are included with a 70 970 or AMD
Radeon graphics card purchase so it's
something to think about make sure that
you're doing the math if you're planning
to buy that game anyway especially
immediately factor that in but if you
are looking for the balls to the walls
best performing single card solution and
single card really is what I recommend
more than a dual card setup particularly
on the AMD side where it can hurt the
experience more than it actually helps
it seriously guys Google frame rating
it's true if you're looking for the
ultimate single card experience I would
point it this guy as opposed to the GTX
Titan it performs almost as well as a
Titan has all those cool features and
really leaves the last generation gtx
680 in the dust thank you for checking
