2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm all right guys we're
kicking off our day 1 coverage of
computex 2013 in our home base and the
WD booth don't forget we are giving away
a ton of cool stuff courtesy of Western
Digital after the show the more you
watch our WD coverage of the show the
more prizes were going to be giving away
everything from hard drives to full
gaming systems all that kind of cool
stuff check out the link to the forum
under in the video description to get
all of the details now behind me you're
going to see the main attraction here in
the WD booth this is a 14-foot 250 pound
racing car made out of what is
essentially a high-density foam that is
molded into the shape of actual hard
drive components with a steel frame it
has a racing seat inside so you can
actually sit in it and get your picture
taken as part of the booths attraction
and we are going to be getting a sneak
peek of the reveal that's actually going
to happen in a little while but you'll
see at first on Linus tech tips this is
it this is the big reveal I have my
lovely assistants from WD revealing this
car go ahead guys which is actually made
so they took CAD drawings of components
of a hard drive some of the highest
performance hard drives that you could
possibly feasibly imagine with
technology today and they blew it up
huge scale so some of the things are
blown up more or less than others this
right here is a hard drive platter and
it's actually not that much bigger than
what you'd find in a three and a half
inch drive however this guy here it's
significantly larger than what you'd see
in real life this is a dual stage
actuator assembly here that is what
actually reads and writes the data off
of the platters and the cool thing about
this is well it looks pretty big here
and you can probably fit that platter I
showed you before in between the actual
distance between these and the platters
in real life is a hundred angstrom so to
put that in perspective a human hair is
a million angstroms a bacteria is five
thousand angstroms and a virus is about
a hundred angstroms so these things are
flying many many miles an hour over the
top of the
and they're the tolerances are are not
very big so we're going to make our way
towards the back of the car these are
the coils that actually drive the head
assembly over the platters themselves
they have to be extremely precise in
order to read any data off of it at all
we've got more dual-stage actuators more
coils all of this is made of a
high-density foam with a steel skeleton
so the whole thing actually only weighs
250 pounds making it very portable but
it's solid enough that you can actually
sit in the thing now the amount at the
craftsmanship that went into this is his
hand dope so if you were to get really
really close you'd be able to see every
sandpaper mark on the thing because they
spent countless hours building this
thing to show off their technology so
down here we've actually got a PCB trace
that's been blown up to car size as well
as a pivot bearing right here so these
high technology bearings actually have
to be smooth enough and precise enough
for that well that those those tiny tiny
data tolerances now we're going to sort
of cheat and we're going to be the first
ones to sit in the car here I'm just
going to lift up the side door we're
going to go ahead and see if I can
maneuver this thing so while it is
durable enough to sit in I also wouldn't
recommend jumping right into it because
it is made of a foam it doesn't have
quite the same structural strength as an
actual western digital hard drive here
we go and of course I can't promise that
any hard drive you buy will make you
this cool but if there's even a chance I
think I'll go for it guys stay tuned
