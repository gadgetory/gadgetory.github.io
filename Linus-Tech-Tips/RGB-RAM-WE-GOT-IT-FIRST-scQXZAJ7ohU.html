the 19th of December with this picture
in it naturally my initial reaction was
to freak the math out but pictures on
the internet could have been planted
there by the dishonest media right I've
been told that our GB RAM if not
impossible is impractical due to the
signal integrity issues that already
exist with even single LED color
high-speed computer memory so I demanded
proof I immediately sent them an email
asking to be the first to showcase their
groundbreaking entrance into the RGB
product arena and it's here the trident
z RGB memory from g.skill
the essentials kit from cable mod gives
you everything needed to give your rig a
professionally sleeved look check it out
at the link in the video description ok
so here it is on my usual x99 deluxe 2
test bench by default out of the box it
comes with this kind of rainbow wave
effect that IMO looks dope AF but it's
not synchronized with any of the other
lighting in your system or even
synchronized between the memory sticks
installed in the system so considering
then that there are five individually
addressable RGB zones along each of the
modules it would be a crying shame if we
limited ourselves to just that wouldn't
it so let's kick things up a notch
trigons the RGB modules can be
controlled a couple of ways you can use
a suit or ax to synchronize their RGB
lighting with the rest of your system or
you can use G skills own software which
I've obtained an early copy of on the
condition that I don't show the
interface since it's not yet final and
on the subject of non-final software x99
z170 AMD risin chipset and motherboard
manufacturers other than a suit will be
supported soon TM but they don't work
yet
hence the swap out to the Maximus 9 code
alright so now that we're rocking a
compatible motherboard we get to play
around with all the different options in
g.skill software so let's try some of
these modes then shall we damn there are
a lot of cool settings in here so you
can configure different solid colors you
can setup any one of us ton of different
hand animations there's the ability to
synchronize your effects between modules
and even the option to configure the
colors of every one of the five color
zones on each module individually I got
to be honest with you guys I think I'm
starting to catch the RGB bug here I
mean this is great why not do the video
card next I mean who needs a Titan XT
when you can have a gtx 1050 TI Strix
with our RGB support yes my friends so
now that the video card is color cycling
and sync with the rest of my system I'm
kind of thinking to myself the sky's the
limit
next stage let's rip all of these power
supply cables out of here
let's clean up the old test bench get
her looking 50 beautiful and maybe ah
yes this is a nice touch let's throw a
couple of cable mods RGB strips which
incidentally happen to also be already
and compatible with the RGB headers that
you'll find at the top and bottom of the
board so we can get those synchronized
with the rest of the board lighting for
some wicked underglow effect leaving the
only standout really awful thing about
this build the nock to a fan the
performance is great but I think the
final finishing touch here has to be a
couple of Corsairs HD fans there are new
RGB fans with a little separate
controller module that lets you pick
colors and lighting effect and finally
we're done I present to you the line of
test bench 2.0 she's falling apart when
I do that now with 2,000 percent more
RGB lighting isn't it beautiful my
friends
so thanks for watching guys if you
dislike dislike if you likes then like
get subscribed maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description
also down there is our t-shirt store in
our community forum which you should
totally join now that you're done doing
all that you're probably wondering what
to watch next so check out our video
suggestions which will be chosen
probably by Nick because we have like a
new outro animation thing maybe by the
time this video goes up what I'm saying
right now won't make a ton of sense it's
the same old outro animation</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
