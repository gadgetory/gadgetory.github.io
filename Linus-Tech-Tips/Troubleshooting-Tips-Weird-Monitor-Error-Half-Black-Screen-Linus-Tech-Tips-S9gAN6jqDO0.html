the screen is clearly divided down the
middle with one half being functional
and the other half see exactly half
being entirely non-functional and I've
gone into the screen resolution already
and I've verified that it is running at
the correct setting if I bring the mouse
if I move it over to the right side you
can see it takes exactly the same amount
of time for me to bring it back over to
the left so there is clearly desktop
back there but it's not being displayed
I've tried unplugging and plugging back
in the monitor once and so far that
hasn't fixed it so when I resolve this
and this is a known good graphics card
as far as I know it just worked but that
one side was all this I will let you
guys know what it ended up being but I
just thought I'd share this with you
I've never seen this before so it was
doing it everywhere in the BIOS in
Windows even after I unplugged the
graphics card and it was giving me like
you know no signal connected error like
it would be over here and I wouldn't see
it and it would be over here and I'd see
it and be here and I like it would cut
off half so what I did was I
disconnected the monitor completely from
power um data everything and then I
waited like 10 minutes then plug it back
in and now it works so I have no idea
how that happened but that's a tech tips
moment that I thought I'd share with you
and this is why it is so hard to produce
these videos because there is so much
stuff like this that goes on behind the
scenes you wouldn't even believe it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
