our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys the first thing here is
perceptual technology so this is
basically the concept of interacting
with computers in ways that do not
involve directly touching them
interacting with a keyboard a mouse or
something like a touchscreen so a few
examples of how you can use this and how
it might be implemented are actually
here on display right now so right here
we have what is more than just a webcam
this is an ir emitter and ir receiver as
well as a regular webcam so i can do
some very cool things number one is
because of the way that you interact
with it you can do not only just to D
gestures but also 3d gestures much like
something like Microsoft Kinect because
of the infrared camera can do a bunch of
other stuff as well including pick up on
their emotions in ways that can tell you
things like okay so it knows your heart
rate it knows your pupil dilation it
knows cutter how you're feeling about
something so maybe you're playing a
video game with someone and you're using
this kind of a perceptual computing
concept to play it might say something
like look your gaming partner is getting
bored it might be time to switch games
or if you watch your movie they might go
hey you watch a movie like that before
and you didn't really like it you
weren't enjoying yourself when you were
watching it are you sure you want to
check that out so one of the ones over
there actually has a guy operating what
is sort of like a you know gravity gun
or something along those lines you can
see you can manipulate it in 3d space
just like this move it forward move it
back another example right here on the
tourney table down here is using this
idea to
put me inside of a virtual space now
obviously this is a very early version
and there's going to be a lot of work to
be done before this is ready for prime
time but it's a very interesting concept
thanks for watching Linus tech tips at
CES 2013 powered by corsair seagate
technology and linksys
