looks not very interesting a single
powerline adapter from Netgear why is
this cool well because it is compliant
with the draft standard 1905 point one
HiFi or hybrid fidelity standard from
qualcomm so what's interesting about
that is that it is going to turn power
line into something from something
that's kind of niche requires multiple
adapters and isn't really integrated
with the rest of your network in a
meaningful way it's gonna turn that as
well as wireless access points that
operate on power line and wireless range
extenders into something that
automatically provides fail-safes
automatically picks the optimal path for
your network to travel in order to give
you the best possible networking
throughout your entire home so that
sounds like very vague and very nebulous
so what I'll do is I'll give you guys an
example over here no I'm gonna read only
here I have a 1905 compliant router so
this router has your standard wired
wireless interfaces and it has a plug
that goes into the wall and turns your
entire house into a power line ready
network right here I have a completely
the wrong brand powerline adapter this
is Netgear the router that I have is
dealing but it has the high-five
software loaded on it which means that
it can communicate with this in fact all
hi-fi compliant devices will with one
button configuration figure out how to
communicate with each other in order to
pick the best possible path so here
here's my hypothetical network so I plug
this into the wall I got some computer
plugged in here I've got a wireless
phone here my phone is operating off of
wireless and then I take this powerline
adapter and I go plug it in somewhere
else entirely
okay so if I have all of my network
devices enabled on and say something
like a notebook I will go Wi-Fi
automatically
now with this software patch assuming
all of my adapters and all of my
equipment is compatible what it'll do is
if I plug into here it will
automatically go over power line if I
plug into a wire it will automatically
go over wired so what it'll do is it'll
intelligently figure out what the best
possible path so if I have a TV let's
say my TV has built-in Wi-Fi okay and
then I'll have something else plugged in
by Ethernet so it'll automatically go
okay
the quickest possible way the best
possible way with the best signal is to
go through Ethernet and then go
wirelessly to the TV or it might decide
that's not the best what if my house is
really big and I have either a powerline
or some other kind of access point that
or a range extender setup on my network
your range extender as long as it's high
five ready you're okay get this your
router will know to take the wired
signal and pass it not directly to the
TV but to the enabled range extender
which will then pass it to the TV if
that is the strongest signal that it can
achieve so that's what's cool about this
it will allow us to take power line
which I'm a huge advocate of if you guys
want to need my videos you probably
already know that and turn it into
something that works seamlessly between
manufacturers right now the only way to
set up powerline is you go Ethernet
cable from the back your router into a
powerline adapter powerline adapter into
the wall and then you have another
powerline adapter somewhere else that
goes out with an Ethernet cable to
something else well now we're taking out
one of them so we're reducing the
overall cost of implementation for
powerline and we're making it more
interoperable so you don't have to worry
about all if I buy this powerline
adapter now and I want to expand my
network later and I can't get it anymore
it's not going to be compatible you
don't think about that anymore as long
as it's 19:05 compliant then you'll be
able to use completely mismatched
hardware like this and build your
network in a way that is seamlessly
upgradable and intelligently decides
what is the fastest way to move your
data around that seems like a very good
thing to me and since this is
technically an unboxing of the powerline
AV 500 adapter I should probably talk
about this guy a little bit it's got a
gigabit connection on it and that's not
necess
barely something you might consider
relevant but it is because even though
it's only a 500 megabit per second
powerline adapter many 500 megabit per
second powerline adapters and 200
megabits per second powerline adapters
include only ten hundred ports which
means that unless you're using multiple
adapters in which case it behaves more
like a hub you are actually going to be
limited by this port rather than by the
powerline interface itself so why would
you need a 500 megabits per second
powerline adapter well if you wanted to
stream multimedia multiple HD streams
and have a gigabit connection you would
need that otherwise a 200 megabit per
second connection is probably fine you
can actually stream HD over 200 megabit
just fine as long as you aren't running
multiple powerline adapters because like
I said multiple powerline adapters will
act as a hub so that means that instead
of sending the data only where it goes
powerline will actually transmit the
data to every node on the network and so
you can end up with a lot of overhead if
you have a whole bunch of powerline
devices so I'd say anywhere from you
know two to probably around five is
about all you really want to do although
most households won't need much more
than that
