at the fractal designs define our two
computer case but now I've actually gone
ahead and done a quick build inside it
just to kind of get a feel for how easy
it is to build inside how quiet it is
because that's what everyone seem to
want to know about it so first of all at
the front I I mentioned in my unboxing
that it lights up with a blue LED now we
actually get to see what it looks like
lit up still very clean and very
plain-looking that's the only lighting
on the case the door opens up where we
can find inside the one I haven't
installed any aftermarket fans or
anything so it only has the one stock
black-and-white fan and then I've
installed one DVD drive for this
particular demo sister and you can't
really look through there and see the
hard drives but that's okay
alright so why don't we get this open
here and I have not used their mod you
vent feature because this is supposed to
be a silent build that is how the case
is targeted and marketed so I've left
all of the noise deadening materials on
the extra ventilation holes alright so
I'm taking off that heavy side panel
because it's got all of that sound
deadening material inside so the inside
of this case is actually really clever
it did not take me long to do this build
and I was able to do a very tidy job as
you can see of the cable management so
I'm not using a modular power supply I'm
using their Tesla 650 watt power supply
and I've used the included cable ties to
tie up all of the unnecessary cables I'm
running a GTX 275 and you can see I've
still got about another inch and a half
of space at the end to install
potentially an even longer video card
I'm using their grommeted cable routing
holes in order to use the 24 pin power
supply connector as well as to run a
cable up to my optical drive up here and
to run the eight pin connector up to the
top of my motherboard now let me see
what else I wanted to say but oh another
cool thing that I did not mention about
this case is it actually has a noise
deadening material where you mount the
power supply to the case so there's a
little bit of foam in there and their
power supplies actually include overly
long screws so that you can attach them
easily and leave enough space that you
are going to take advantage of that
annoys deadening another cool feature
and this is kind of a why didn't anyone
else think of it sort of thing there are
extra holes on
their harddrive mounting sleds you can
see there's the four rubber rubberized
holes for a normal hard drive and then
there's actually four more and you can
see that they've coded it here a is for
three and a half inch B is for two and a
half inch hard drive or SSD so you can
see that I've installed in this case one
SSD drive which is mounted just the same
way a normal drive would be and then one
three-and-a-half inch one terabyte
Western Digital black drive so I thought
that was one of one of the cleverer
things about this particular chassis so
thank you for checking out my little
demo build here and the define our two
case</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
