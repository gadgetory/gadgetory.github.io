gig ram kit and so I figured I'd grab
their 12 gig round kit as well basically
the only difference between this and any
other ocz Ram kit that is covered in
gold shiny heat spreaders and comes in
blue and orange packaging is that it is
a lot of RAM it used to be that fir of
the practical enthusiast 12 gigs was the
limit to what you could put in any
gaming system whereas now that you can
buy 4 gig dims so these are 1333
megahertz
c9 1.65 volt this is very consumer
oriented specs now you can buy 4 gig
dims at an affordable price point so an
enthusiast could potentially put up to
24 gigabytes of RAM in one system that
is mostly the point of this video I'm
just talking a little bit about it
because these are actually priced quite
reasonably as of the time of releasing
this video and so if you wanted to if
you're waiting for the time to pick up
some cheap 4 gig sticks of RAM this is
probably the time for it they are going
to continue to get faster now every time
we see a new capacity we see sort of it
we see it introduced at a very
mainstream speed at very mainstream
timings and it's not all that impressive
but as time goes on and the bidding
processes get more complex we're gonna
start to see 1600 1866 or even higher 4
gig dims so this is really the beginning
of a new thing for 4 gigs and for having
overall higher memory capacities in
consumer systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
