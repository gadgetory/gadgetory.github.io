has graced us with a new 80 series GPU
20 months in fact since the last one so
we got the GTX 1080 in hands it felt
like a momentous occasion especially
with the vive and the oculus rift
so recently hitting market and since
Nvidia is building their new 10 80s
Pascal architecture as one of their most
ambitious projects yet and saying that
it can beat out their flagship Titan X
and a pair of nine 80s and SLI I think
it's time to see if it can live up to
the hype
so the GTX 1080 is their first card in
their new line of Pascal GPUs continuing
the tradition of Nvidia naming new
generations of GPUs after old dead guys
who were legendarily good at physics and
math and speaking of math the cards GP
104 GPU can certainly do a lot of
processing with 2560 CUDA cores 1700 and
33 megahertz base clock and a 16
nanometer process which is able to allow
them to pack way more transistors onto
the chip for increased performance
Nvidia also switched to a new type of
VRAM called gddr5 X which runs at about
10 gigabits per second
Nvidia says that gddr5 x combined with
various improvements like memory
compression it ends up being 1.7 times
faster in terms of effective memory
bandwidth than a GTX 980 they crammed
eight gigabytes of this stuff inside the
1080 but if you are more inclined to go
for the 1070 when that comes out it also
has eight gigabytes but just more
standard gddr5 so keep that in mind if
you will be disappointed by buying a
product that has slightly less X's on
its product sheet but beyond raw specs
there were also some other features that
Nvidia baked into the Pascal PI such as
simultaneous multipe rejection which
allows Pascal to project 16 different
viewports each with the ability to
rotate in order to better match the
current display setup that you have and
it has the ability to project more than
one of these viewports at once this
enables graphics techniques such as
perspective surround which
correct image perspectives across
multiple monitors so you don't get that
weird warping on multi-monitor surround
anymore like massive scale issues and
stuff that should be fixed then there's
a personal favorite of mine single pass
stereo this allows Pascal to render
geometry for an object in VR only once
instead of twice per eye then it just
uses simple transforms to generate the
view for both eyes but if you're not
really into VR and you want something
for the desktop side never fear there's
something for you as well and that's
called multi reading Nvidia included
multi ready for the desktop guys as well
it allows you to focus more of your GPU
power near the center of the screen and
less on the outside this will result in
higher resolution and detail in the
middle and lower resolution and detail
on the outside where you are
theoretically paying less attention to
this should help performance but we'll
see if it really matters later on when
used for VR various SMP techniques
including the ones not fully covered
here equate to 1.5 times the pixel
throughput and 2 times the geometry
throughput than would otherwise have
been possible
then there's Ansel technology which was
introduced to take gaming screenshots to
the next level which sounds like the
most boring thing possible but just hang
with me it allows you to take
screenshots from any angle and position
by using a free-floating camera that can
detach from your character it also
allows you to run simple filters over
these images for that oh so professional
Instagram look it also allows you to
take raw or EXR photos give you full
dynamic range for all your image editing
needs it takes said photos or
screenshots in super resolution which is
currently limited to 4.5 gigapixel
images with 3600 CUDA stitched tiles
this limitation is because of game
settings the resolution of the game and
the speed of your storage drive so it
should actually be expected to increase
in the future and last but not least is
360 degree photos so you can capture
those legendary fight scenes in
awesomely unique ways and then view them
in VR or whatever
although when all is said and done I
expect most of the pictures from Ansel
will be using the free camera to capture
derpy faces of NPCs Ansel does have to
be enabled by the developer and right
now there's a
a relatively short list of games that
support it and I wouldn't expect a huge
amount of multiplayer games to either
yes the division is included but I think
it's not going to be in the dark zone
that's it for Ansel and then we come to
VR works audio and VR works touch the
our audio can trace the physical path of
sound to give you a more realistic
experience while you're using a headset
and VR touch uses physics to improve on
how things in the environment react with
your virtual hands both of these should
make pretty good improvements in terms
of immersion in the future once they're
more implemented now we got our hands on
the founders Edition which sounds fancy
but is really just what NVIDIA is
calling the reference version of this
card and is selling for $6.99 a full
$100 more than the MSRP for bass models
from add in partners whose cards I
expect to see at Computex like they were
last time so stay tuned to Linus tech
tips for that Nvidia is trying to
justify the higher cost by saying that
they're using premium components in
manufacturing like die cast aluminum and
a low-profile backplate along with a
vapor chamber which should improve
cooling but it's important to note that
the chips and the founders efficient
boards shouldn't be Bend in any way the
cooler for the 1080 is similar to the
silver and black shrouds and blower
style fan that we've seen in video doing
for quite a while now but has a more
angled aggressive look reminiscent of
basically every environment in the last
deus ex game the connectivity support is
good as it features hdmi 2.0 for 4k 60
hertz 3 display point 1.4 connectors for
4k at 120 Hertz or 8k at 60 hertz holy
crap and a dual link DVI however the
1080 only supports two-way SLI natively
even though it has two sli fingers that
is because the two sli fingers have been
teamed together to improve bandwidth
with the new sli bridge nvidia no longer
recommends three and four-way SLI which
is probably a good thing to be honest
but they do suggest if you need to burn
that much money on that many cards that
you do two-way SLI and have a third card
just for physics but it is possible to
force three-way and four-way SLI if you
sign up for Nvidia enthusiasts key which
registers your card
I expect an even worse experience from
this form of SLI then
past versions of SLI and wood
whole-heartedly not recommend it all in
all and Vidya has called this the
largest chip processor endeavor in the
history of humanity with a multi-billion
dollar budget which Nvidia CEO
speculated might be enough to go to Mars
but as nvidia is in the business of
making GPUs not sending people off to
other worlds for interplanetary land
parties let's move on and just a note if
it seems like we don't have a lot of AMD
cards in our testing it's because the
new Polaris AMD architecture which is
supposed to compete with Pascal is right
around the corner it's not quite here
yet we'll have much more from the red
team when those cards drop with that
being said let's have a look at how the
benchmarking turned out all the testing
was done at 4k because what's the point
of running things that lower res when
you have the power of something like a
1080 and speaking of which if you do
have this nice setup but a 1080p monitor
it's better to run your games at higher
resolutions anyways with super sampling
and they just have them displayed on
your 1080p monitor if you're wondering
how to do that check the guide up here
we are waiting for the VR games market
to mature a bit before we test it very
much because it's a little bit messy
right now but we did throw Crysis 3 and
Star Wars Battlefront at the 1080 and
various other cars to see how they would
perform and the 1080 solidly beat the
fury X and Titan X and then ran right
alongside the sli 980 s which was quite
impressive having a single card run
toe-to-toe with a dual card setup while
being just over half the price is a
strong start for our new funny named
friend for DirectX 12 performance we
booted up rise of the Tomb Raider and
hitman the 1080 pulled off some
impressive numbers crushing the Titan X
and laughing at the 9:00 80s as they
flopped around in confused sli enabled
circles as they struggled with poor DX
12 optimizations and DS performance here
was stronger than the 900 series but the
1080 was still able to manage an overall
victory while those numbers were a
little bit all over the DirectX 11
performance for these games was more of
a standard curve with performance
expectations lining up nice and orderly
if you're aiming for 4k at 60fps then
the 1080 will not disappoint as its able
to run everything on high presets near
or above 60 frames per second
the respectively cheaper and when
looking at the Titan X better performing
option on the nvidia side for power draw
the entire bench only drew 252 watts
from the wall which gives you a ton of
options in terms of lower wattage power
supplies we've inspire supplies and
whatnot the thermals were standard fare
from in-video with all of our cards
holding steady at around 81 to 83
degrees Celsius
sorry Nvidia's claims about it beating
at Titan X and SLI 980 s true I'd say
mostly it does cleanly beat the Titan X
across the board but putting it up
against a 980 duo is a bit more of a
mixed bag it ones some of the benchmarks
but lost others the losses however at
least in actual games were quite narrow
and in any event the 1080 is clearly the
better choice for newer games especially
when they have dx12 support and it frees
you from the well-documented issues with
SLI $4 per frame we're assuming a value
of $5.99 for the 1080 in our
calculations as we expect whatever
you're able to get from the add in board
partners should either match or beat the
reference founders Edition card while
being $100 cheaper so this dollars per
frame is for Pascal 1080 in general not
the founders Edition the 1080 blows
everything away in this metric except
for the r9 390x in hitman specifically
but when you consider that the 390x has
lower frame rates across the board it's
still a pretty darn compelling value to
get an aftermarket 1080 so what's our
conclusion well for 599 dollars if that
is your budget for a card the 1080 is a
no-brainer its ability to hit 60fps at
4k with lots of eye candy in the latest
titles combined with per frame cost
that's basically the lowest in the world
of high-end graphics cards right now
it's a pretty obvious choice again if
that is your budget we still haven't
gotten a single GPU card that can run 4k
games at 60fps with max settings without
breaking a sweat and at $600 the 1080 is
still pretty steep in terms of pricing
but it is the king of the hill for now
it'll be interesting to see what results
we can get with overclocking as Nvidia
is claiming a lot in that department and
how well AMD's Polaris will answer this
challenge especially once DirectX 12
games hit the
market later this year thanks for
watching guys hopefully the animal
noises weren't too annoying this was
filmed in Mexico we are not back yet
although the embargo will be like six
hours after we land or something so if
you like the video like it if you
disliked it and you were like this was
filmed in a getaway and there's animal
noises or more you can dislike it be
subscribed if you want to see more
coverage of the 1080 if it's anything
like 980 will release a lot of videos on
it if you want a t-shirt that's cool you
can check out the link in the
description down below you can become a
contributor on the forum you can use our
Amazon affiliate code to buy stuff like
new GPUs in the next little while
Polaris Pascal which one you get which P
are you deciding to go for I don't know
it's up to you yeah check out this video
this is the launch video for the GTX 980
I don't know why you would watch it
right now but go watch it anyways and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
