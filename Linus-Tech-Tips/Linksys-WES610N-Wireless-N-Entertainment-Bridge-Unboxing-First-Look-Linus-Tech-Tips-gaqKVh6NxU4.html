s 6/10 n this is a four port dual band
and entertainment Bridge so what is it
entertainment bridge well I would say
that is a bridge that whenever you walk
over it there is entertainment to be
found such as the Golden Gate Bridge
with a circus next to it that is what I
would consider to be an entertainment
bridge nope this is a different kind of
entertainment Bridge this is a wireless
bridge which is to say that it bridges
your wireless network to a wired network
and it is for entertainment in that it
is fast so it is fully ready for HD and
3d content
Slick's giving me a hard time about the
reflections coming off this box so why
don't we just put the box open get the
product on the table and then I will
tell you about how it is fast seperately
if it pleases His Highness
okay actually it's you guys who are
complaining about all the focusing
issues and yes we're aware of them no we
can't really do anything about the
camera for the time being but there you
have it let's get this thing opened up
and I'm actually pretty excited about
this one because this is the kind of
thing that is actually useful it's not
networking for the sake of networking it
is networking for the sake of making my
life a little bit easier and better so
fully HD and 3d ready it is 300 megabit
per second it is dual bands so that is
2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz offers
superior range has fast ethernet ports
which I believe means
10100 Ethernet ports which are pretty
much as slow as it gets but as fast as
you will need em and push button setup
so how does this work basically what you
do is you set up the wireless
entertainment bridge by using WPS or by
configuring it using the utility here
this is actually one case where I would
say it kind of helps to have the the
setup guide
because you just plug this in then it
walks you through everything and it's
really really easy we've actually done
it already with the range extender and
then what you do is you reposition the
bridge sort of further away or wherever
you want to put it and you're good to go
speaking of where you would want to put
it what is this for so on the back you
are going to find four Ethernet ports as
well as power it what are those for
Ethernet ports for bicycle entertainment
birds I still haven't told you this so
it is an entertainment bridge because it
is intended to be put near your
entertainment so a lot of people have
home theaters these days that is to say
a TV but stuff connected to it so a TV
with stuff connected to it often has
network stuff connected to it so things
that you would connect to your TV that
have networking these days so blu-ray
players Xboxes we's ps3's i don't know
those little network media player things
like a patriot box office something like
that maybe you got some network storage
that you happen to have nearby maybe
you've got I mean even Smart TVs now
they need Ethernet as well so Ethernet
you need all these Ethernet connections
what are you gonna do are you gonna run
from your switch which is you know
probably in your basement or probably in
your attic or somewhere out of the way
from your switch are you actually gonna
run four to five - six - who knows how
many Ethernet cables down to your media
center well no you're not so one option
is to run a single cable and use a
switch to split it out into all the
different devices and another option if
you live in a house like mine where I
happen to have a brick wall backing my
entertainment center which me as a
camera and anything down the wall I have
no crawl space so I can't run anything
through the floor
I don't want unsightly wires running
around so I am stuck we have either
powerline or Wireless so if power line
doesn't work in your house for whatever
reason then you go with Wireless if
Wireless doesn't work for whatever
reason you go with powerline at least
you have those two options so this guy
allows me to take my wireless network
which already exists in my house it
communicates with my router that way and
then it acts as a four port switch so I
can plug it into my Xbox my TV my
blu-ray player and maybe I have one
auxilary jack in order to get networking
to all of those devices
at the same time now none of these are
going to be sort of you know sucking all
the bandwidth at the same time most of
these devices are just going to be about
you know running an update or you know
changing the firmware or whatever else
the case may be but the entertainment
bridge due to being 300 megabits per
second dual Bend does have the bandwidth
to take at least one of those devices
and run 1080p HD content to it as long
as you're within a reasonable range so I
think that pretty much covers everything
as far as usage scenarios goes on this
one let me just see if I've missed
anything we'll check this out multiple
antennas for expanded coverage and
reliability dual band we already covered
that quality of service traffic priors
our prioritization deliver smooth video
and gaming performance that's kind of
cool
okay advanced security wpa2 security to
help keep your network protected
Wireless 802.11 n for top performance
yeah and backwards compatibility with
ABG and let's see what else we got oh
yeah here so I guess I didn't really
have to spell all that out for you guys
because no Canon Xbox a blu-ray player
and something else and TV wireless n
router Wireless this is the bridge this
is the entertainment in terms of other
things that are included we have an
Ethernet cable of what you'll need
probably at least one hopefully because
if you're just putting this bridge like
next to your TV and you don't actually
plug in Ethernet cable into it you're
kind of missing the point and then we
also have a power adapter and finally we
have a Linksys dual bed and
entertainment Bridge CD which I actually
do recommend using because it does make
your life a little bit easier thank you
