little bit different I will be following
the excellent instructions I found on
wikiHow comm to build my own DIY paint
spraying booth why would I do such a
thing great question
because I want to paint a video card
orange without getting any dust in my
paint job that's why
step one in this guide is hilarious
visualize your design it says let me
plot if I had any vision would I need a
guide on wiki au for how to do this so
no I'll try treif used to do any
visualization which surprisingly ended
up biting me in the butt only a little
bit later on steps two and three the
measuring and the cutting of the PVC
tubing were by far the most tedious but
actually still only took about 40
minutes depending on your goal you might
alter the provided design a little bit
which is easy enough by the way but
while making something smaller might be
better for painting like tabletop gaming
figurines or something like that if you
wanted to do something bigger
I don't know how suitable this design
would be and you might want to look into
something more professional the guide is
for an eight foot by four foot enclosure
for step four the article suggests
laying out all of the pipes that are cut
by size but I actually went one step
further and labeled each of the pieces
to make my life a little bit easier
later on and I'm really glad that I did
that because depending on what
alterations you made to the design you
might have some lengths of piping that
are very very close to each other and
writing it down once is better than
going back and remeasuring them
constantly for Step five my lovely
assistant showed up to help me and if
you've ever assembled IKEA furniture
with a significant other and remember
this is basically IKEA furniture without
even IKEA grade instructions and
included tools then you probably have
some idea how it went from this point on
where are your safety glasses right but
those are not safety glasses those are
metal shards and they're glass shards
and the eyeglasses you basically want to
choose the flattest and straightest of
the four leg pieces to serve as the legs
then you put the appropriate PVC T
joints on them for the horizontal cross
braces so you've got four tall pieces
for each of the four
or so it is suggested that we use a lot
of pressure to pop these babies on
you've been having a lot of mms lately
might you lean on it it was at this
point that I realized though that I had
missed some of the cutting and needed to
go back in time to make some small
several inch long cuts that would help
us join our 90 degree elbows and our T
pieces derp
wait what how are you supposed to do
that
wait a minute what no I don't think they
do do that how is that supposed to work
so how would you oh great now how is
this gonna come out oh are we supposed
to cut another small piece to go in
there from there it was a matter of
disassembling the upper part of the
frame adding the middle section that
allows you to hang project materials
that are difficult to lay down flat and
finally putting in a middle support step
six is fine-tuning which of course I
skip since my assembly was perfect from
the get-go which leads us to step seven
and closing the booth in plastic here's
where the instructions get a little
wishy-washy so we just kind of started
making it up as we went along we draped
plastic over the structure then taped it
up like a Christmas present the
objective here is to pose in your
workspace remember you'll be wearing a
face mask and eye protection if you care
about your health at all and you want to
keep dust out and keep paint in so that
you aren't contaminating the outside
area
step eight now it's time to put your
drop sheet down honestly I don't think
it was necessary to buy a fancy canvas
drop sheet for this but I didn't have
time to visualize the design at the
beginning so I certainly wasn't going to
run around making changes to the recipe
willy-nilly so there you go you're going
to want to tape this drop sheet or
whatever else it is that you end up
using to the plastic sheeting on the
sides to ensure again that you're
closing everything in step 9
this is another visualization would have
been helpful moment make sure that you
have a plan for how you're going
mount your box fan before you start I
thought that I was going to put it on a
ladder but that ended up being too tall
so I had to find a monitor box that I
had lying around once you've decided on
a height for the fan mark it and move on
to step 10 where you cut out the hole
for the furnace filter tape that baby on
then tape your Box stand to it so that
you can exhaust air from your paint
booth without compromising the health of
the people around you and that's pretty
much it one trip to the local hardware
store and two hours later we've got
ourselves a DIY paint booth suitable for
small hobbyist grade projects please
note though that if your intention is to
use it more than occasionally or with
oil-based epoxies and paints like the
hardcore stuff you should invest in a
couple of fans that cannot ignite
flammable paint fumes and just generally
have a beefier set up overall but this
is great for what I need and I'm glad
that you came along with me for the ride
of creating it Soylent is a
nutritionally complete meal that comes
at an affordable price and in an
affordable bottle it contains all the
elements of a healthy diet with limited
contribution from less healthy aspects
like refined sugar saturated fats and
cholesterol the recipe is based on
recommendations from the Institute of
Medicine in the US and is regulated by
the FDA so the ingredients include oat
flour rice and soy proteins as well as
omega-3 fatty acids and their customized
micronutrient blend provides essential
nutrients like vitamin D and folate as
well as electrolytes such as potassium
it's convenient and great when you're on
the go as either a ready to drink bottle
or as a powder that you can mix with
water or I guess you could mix it with
whatever else you want
Soylent has a neutral taste profile by
design which gives you the freedom to
adjust the flavor by adding fruits or
