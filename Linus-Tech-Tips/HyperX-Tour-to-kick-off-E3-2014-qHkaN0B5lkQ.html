has slept in a while but we had to check
out the HyperX offices because they've
got tons of new stuff here and it's
absolutely fantastic so come along with
me and we'll check it out so we get to
what's probably the coolest room in all
of LA to be completely honest and puts
my personal land area to shame in my
land area I have some like crappy
zombified systems that are barely
running and here they have systems with
dual 480gb by trade 02 SSDs from hyperx
more RAM that you could possibly want
and hyperx headsets all over the place
this place is insane it's a 5v5 land
gaming setup where the leader of both
teams is going to have dual monitors up
so we can manage the stream I think I
have tournaments in here all the time
I'm really excited to see what they push
out of here as we get to check out the
caster room next door so this is the
disconnected casting room it's not set
up for it right now but if there's a
tournament going on the casters could be
in here which is going to be very nice
because like i said it's disconnected
the players don't have to hear the
caster is talking about the game which
could potentially ruin the game so it's
great they have this setup for when a
tournament is going on I may or may not
have gotten caught trying to sneak into
their testing lab but this is where all
the cool hardcore stuff goes down this
is all the testing checking out new
modules maybe ddr4 I'm not sure didn't
get to get in there but we'll move on
for now so just in case you weren't
absolutely sure that you wanted to quit
your day job and try to work here yet
these are their office computers which
are some of the most beast machine
office computers have ever seen and
everybody here gets a custom need for
seat chair this place is amazing you
want to see more of this kind of stuff
and you want to see more of our e3
coverage we turn to subscribe to Linus
tech tips and go to hyperx unbeatable
calm and subscribe there as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
