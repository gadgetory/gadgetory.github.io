this is an a do two series which
basically means that it is MD based
wait they're calling this the ad 10 this
isn't what I thought it was okay well
this is the Z box Nano 8010 so this is a
MD base so I did at least have that much
figured out so this is a dual core APU
at 1 point 6 gigahertz which means it
has integrated Radeon 6310 graphics you
have to add your own memory up to 4 gigs
as well as 2 and a half inch drive so
that's already been done in this unit
because we're actually going to be using
this very unit to show off some pretty
cool functionality including XBMC
running off of this device and powering
some very intensive HD content in a very
small form factor and I'll show you guys
the form back in a minute
what else we got so for networking we've
also got gigabit network as well as
wireless and included as an bluetooth
3.0 it comes with a remote control and
integrated IR receiver it has an SD card
reader onboard 8 channel digital audio
via HDMI as well as stereo analog audio
on the front hdmi displayport mic
headphones we've got some documentation
here don't really care what else we got
here your palm-sized mini pc okay sure
yeah cool oh here here's the English
version Quick Start Guide there we go so
shows you have it you know put the thing
in the thing plug the other thing into
the other thing okay included room
actually that's not a bad remote so you
got your arrows you got your Windows key
you're playing your back your forwards
all your numbers so this is yeah this is
uh Wow great that's a full media center
remote cool I was not I was not
expecting that I was expecting it to
come with like a cheesy remote alright
what else we got here antenna for the
wireless power cable that plugs into the
power brick which plugs into the ad 10
itself next we've got
look mister mounting screws so yes you
can mount this to the back of your LCD
and oh well gee what's this wow that
must be the IR receiver beat okay so you
can position that wherever you want it
very handy
good thinking ZOTAC so a form factor oh
look at that it comes with them this
comes with everything it comes with the
included base a mounting kit so you can
right out of the box mounted to the back
of your TV or monitor or whatever else
so check out this form factor very very
cool I'm gonna go ahead and take the
plastic off here so you guys can see
this orange ring actually lights up but
there is a bios option where you can
disable it so if you want sort of a more
stealthy media PC than that is
definitely an option look at this metal
construction - this uses aluminum
construction and then a plastic bottom
and a plastic top so you can feel it's
quite quite cool to the touch which
means that
besides this venting a hole right here
you're actually going to get a little
bit of passive heat output just from the
aluminum construction very neat okay so
we've got our microphone and headphone
SD as well as memory stick if anyone
still cares about that an XD maybe
that's the infrared receiver okay well
either way okay between this antenna
this thing right here and this thing
right here it has bluetooth IR and Wi-Fi
okay there here's your power switch it's
not a reset button no I think that's
just an LED around so we've already seen
the ventilation report and then there is
where you plug in that Wi-Fi okay that's
gonna be Wi-Fi that Wi-Fi antenna we've
also got an eSATA port it doesn't look
like powered eSATA though so it's just
regular eSATA we've got two USB 2.0
ports a Kensington lock Gigabit Ethernet
- super speed USB 3.0 ports DisplayPort
and HDMI out remember that's where
you're going to get your digital audio
out and the power in is right here as
well on the bottom we find a couple of
ventilation holes here and then you can
see this has been sort of touched a lot
already it's actually been opened up so
you can open up the unit install your
drive install your RAM
and then you're pretty much good to go
so it's a very cool little piece of
hardware you can buy this a bare-bones
or you can buy it pre-configured with
fiber although if you're buying it on
NCIX then it's probably cheaper to buy
the bare-bones and then buy your own RAM
and drive and that way you get to pick
whatever you want as well the person
who's going to be using this one is
actually going to be using just a little
32 gig SSD just like an older SSD and
throwing it in there because it's not
going to actually have any data on it
it's going to be replacing his network
media player because between the dual
core as well as the dedicate are
dedicated and they're integrated but
sort of dedicated level AMD HD graphics
included it actually accelerates blu-ray
significantly better than any of the
boxes that he's been able to find so
that's why he's going with this and this
is actually smaller than most of the
network media player boxes that are out
there so very very cool so thank you for
checking out my unboxing your first look
at the zotac busybox nano 8010 and don't
forget to subscribe not only to this
channel for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos but also to my
NCIX Khan channel because that's where
we're going to be showcasing the network
streaming HD processing capabilities of
this little box so stay tuned for that
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
