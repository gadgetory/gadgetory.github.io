one at the time because to the informed
eye it was obvious that what AMD had
done was create a lot of fanfare with a
Hawaii launch event for what was other
than the r9 290 and 290 X which both
featured newly designed silicon
basically an exercise in taking existing
card designs and giving them a shiny new
name that means the current 200 series
is actually a mix of old and new
hardware designs it's fine from a
performance standpoint as long as the
pricing makes sense but it can lead to
confusion even at that launch event andy
talks a lot about trueaudio a feature
that up until now has only been
supported on the r9 260 x and r9 290
series and then again at CES this year
they showed off free sync a dynamic
refresh rate technology similar to gsync
to reduce screen tearing but since
revealed that that also only works on
part of their current lineup because of
this mix of old and new technology so
with that out of the way onto the card
we're introducing today the r9 285 based
on noon codenamed
Tonga silicon might not be
earth-shattering from a performance
standpoint but what it does
aside from delivering great power
efficiency is bring the 250 dollar price
point in line with high-end enthusiast
cards from a feature standpoint with
improved mantle support along with
support for true audio bridgeless
crossfire updated power tune dynamic
performance optimization and finally
free sync
with the purchase of a qualifying Intel
processor SSD or nook you could
instantly win and Intel gaming Jersey
and be entered in the draw for the
ultimate system click now to learn more
now when I said the card wasn't going to
deliver groundbreaking performance I
probably wasn't telling the very clever
among you anything you didn't already
know when we look at its specs compared
to the r9 280 whose price point it
pretty much replaces it features the
same number of coarse texture and render
output units it has a slightly lower
clock speed it has a narrower 256-bit
memory bus with 33% less memory overall
so that's 2 gigs of DDR 5 then it has a
slightly higher memory clock to
compensate for some of those other
deficiencies and it features a 5 percent
lower TDP meaning that heat output will
be reduced of course though with GPUs
it's never about comparing specs
head-to-head directly and AMD has made
some tweaks under the hood that will
improve tessellation performance compute
performance and memory performance that
they hope will make up for some of these
spec deficiencies on top of that AMD has
added a couple of multimedia features
including automatic configuration of the
speakers in your I finna t monitor or TV
setup as left mid and right channels
along with hardware h.264 4k and code
and decode support that will
significantly reduce power consumption
when playing back 4k content this is a
feature that even the new Hawaii r9 290
Series GPUs don't have AMD's engineers
have been busy now AMD didn't send us a
reference card so let's take a minute to
appreciate the specifics of the gigabyte
windforce Edition card that we have
received
like all gigabyte windforce graphics
cards it features an open airflow
non-reference windforce branded cooler
that enough wind force for you this one
features a dual heat pipe and aluminum
thin design that did a great job of
keeping the 285 cool in our testing it's
got two DVI ports HDMI and DisplayPort
it's got dual 100 millimeter fins
it's got reversed PCI Express power
connectors which is actually quite nice
for cable management a PCI Express 16 X
slot on the bottom
and no bridge connector at the top is
needed thanks to the XDM a cross fire
support in the Tonga GPU but you don't
just want to watch me stare at this GPU
thing for seven minutes do you no no you
want to know about the performance well
here it is
take it away Luke alright guys remember
how it used to sound like a zombie all
the time well I'm back first of all none
of these cards are actually overclocked
a large number of you guys have been
asking us to run our benchmarks not
overclocked for some time now and we've
decided to see how it goes
there's also been a platform change we
have swapped out our old platform for a
new Asus x99 deluxe motherboard a 59 30
K running at stock and 16 gigabytes of
g.skill memory also running at a stock
speed of 20 133 megahertz due to a
horrible naming scheme it can be a
little bit confusing figuring out where
the r9 285 lands in AMD's product stack
to try to show where the card falls in
the general graphics card landscape we
decided to benchmark it against the gtx
760 which should be fairly similar in
both price and performance then I threw
it against a gtx 750ti and an r9 290 in
order to represent some other fairly
common price points as well
AMD fans will be happy to hear that the
r9 285 performed admirably in the games
that I tested in beating out the gtx 760
intuitive three tests and proving its
worth in its price bracket to be honest
though this is pretty much exactly what
was expected of this graphics card as
the graphics card game has been pretty
easy to predict as of late well that's
it for zombie voice back to you - so
there you have it folks it performs
about as expected but here's something
you might not have expected AMD is
refreshing their never settle game
bundle program now it's space edition
and this one qualifies for the gold
level so you can pick up - any three of
the 29 games available check it out for
gamers buying graphics cards an
appealing game that they were planning
to pick up anyway can be a very
compelling value add so its conclusion
time you get a DirectX 12 GPU that's
feature complete compared to the rest of
AMD's lineup and
performs about like you'd expect an AMD
GPU that cost 250 bucks to perform hard
to go wrong not the most stunning or
exciting conclusion ever but this isn't
the most stunning or exciting card ever
either not that being a trusty workhorse
is a bad thing it sold a lot of r9 to
80s for AMD and it'll do the same with
the r9 285 thanks for watching guys like
