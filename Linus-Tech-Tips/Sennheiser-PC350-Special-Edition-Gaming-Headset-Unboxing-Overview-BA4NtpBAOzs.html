Sennheiser's pc 350 special edition or
se noise blocking gaming headset so
calling it noise blocking is pretty much
Sennheiser's way of saying that this is
a closed design headphone with a
microphone and by close I mean that it
keeps the noise that keeps the sound in
so all your gaming sounds or music or
movies or whatever else you happen to be
listening to on them stays inside your
headphones and isn't going to leak out
to the people around you who maybe don't
want to hear it so if you're someone who
games late at night or you have a baby
in the next room or whatever else
something like this is a very very good
option it also means that the sounds
stay out so if someone's calling you to
come to dinner for example you may not
hear them which is just sort of the
situation so the MPC 350 special edition
features optimized sound control for
competitive gaming the sound is trimmed
to provide positional accuracy making it
easier to hear where sound comes from it
features a closed design which isolates
you from the outside noise so you don't
hear even the faintest so you hear even
the faintest details of your game gaming
time is your time and every kill games
you deserve it's no coincidence that
many games are recorded with Sennheiser
audio equipment - they come with a
two-year warranty and they also come in
one of the slimmest packages that I
think I've ever seen a gaming headset
come with so outstanding sonic quality
and clarity with EA our technology
collapsible design and carrying case ok
cool
ease of use integrated volume control on
the ear cup and great for long gaming
sessions with extra large ear pads now I
can actually vouch for the comfort of
this particular headset not that I I've
actually used the original PC 350 not
the 350 SC and while I personally don't
prefer closed headphones and I
personally didn't really find them that
comfortable compared to my HD 5 v 5s
they were one of the only headsets that
my wife would even use she just refused
to use anything else other than these
ones and one other one that she found
acceptable that was able to fit around
her ears and and when she was able to
find them comfortable so here's the
carrying case is quite nice it has like
like a nice textured finish on it feels
right durable it's got a little carrying
handle right here and then the zipper
feels not like something that's just
going to break in two seconds so I mean
these are things that you can't take for
granted to be perfectly honest and
inside we find the collapsible design so
there's some foam to keep it from you
know keep anything bad from happening
during shipping although I don't think
the assumption is that you'll continue
to use that forever they've added an
orange accent to the SE that was not on
the original PC 350 and obvious I'm not
obviously but also the carrying case
that is included with the SE was not
included with the original 350 either so
we can take this piece of foam out looks
like there's a little pouch here so you
can keep a couple little extra
accessories in there button those down
same thing like the inside feels very
nice very high quality very premium they
also layout look at that they've got a
little thing here so that you don't
screw it up and you put it in the right
way every time and then these pieces
right here will keep the ear cups in
place during transport so I'll show you
guys how the design unfolds okay so it
comes out that way comes out that way
and then locks into place over here
somewhere all right it's just kind of
huh that even yeah that's even there you
go and this this right here is one of
the reasons that I didn't find the 350s
that comfortable because they were
pretty much tuned to my wife's head you
can see there they're quite tight so
you're going to want to break these in
before they start to get really
comfortable but then like I said they
were one of the most comfortable
headsets that she would use so basically
a little uh does she ever encountered
like I've seen on quite a few Sennheiser
headphones the ear cups are not super
soft they're not super supple but what
this means is it's a bit of a trade-off
when you have a really soft memory foam
ear cup what can happen is it cannot it
tends to not necessarily conform as much
to your head over time so the comfort
level doesn't really change whereas when
you break in a bit of a harder more more
formable foam over time you what you'll
discover is that it becomes perfectly
tuned to fit your head and it's
uncomfortable for anyone else but super
comfortable for the intended wearer
which is you the 350 uses a boom mic so
I can hear the switch in there it
automatically mutes when you put it up
it into the upright position and then
right here right there see that little
spot where it sticks that's what is
going to reactivate the mic and turn it
back on this boom mic doesn't have
length adjustments so it is intended
only to be adjusted this way and this
way sorry I almost end up putting that
in my mouth there you want the
microphone at the corner of your mouth
so that it doesn't pick up too much
breathing and that's one of the things
that I do like about retractable mics
because this one as you can see is going
to sit right under my massive nose and
might pick up a little bit of my
breathing sound but with that said it is
a noise cancelling microphone so you can
see they have mics on both sides which
is going to enable it to not do that as
much and the flexibility is all provided
by this little piece of the arm right
here so you can go ahead and adjust that
as needed the volume control that is
built in is on the right ear cup so this
is new to the SE as well so you just
rotate the little Sennheiser logo all
the way up and all the way down and
presumably there is a microphone control
somewhere in line here but I guess we'll
have to oh no right because right they
used to have that so that's a controlled
by this now I wouldn't have minded
seeing a bit of a thicker headband I
complained about this a lot whenever I
see it I like a wider headband because
it spreads out the pressure a bit but
what the 350 does have going for it is
unlike the ear cups it is an extremely
soft material up here that has a long
rebound time when you squeeze it in I
hope you guys can see that okay so for a
thin headband this one is extremely
comfortable I think that pretty much
wraps oh yeah no I want to show you guys
sort of the sizing so it goes here this
is where it's sitting comfortably on my
ears
so if you had a super large head it
would fit just fine and then if you're a
kid wearing these I don't think you'll
have much difficulty either because
that's how it sits on my head and I wear
a medium motorcycle helmet so that
should give you guys some idea of my
head size so it's come in here and have
a look at the quality of the braided
cable on here so it comes with a little
strap for tying that up when you want to
transport it or whatever else and yeah I
was mistaken before there
is no inline control because all the
controls are on the headphones
themselves and I prefer this I think
it's much better to have the controls on
the headphones as opposed to fumbling
around with something and because I mean
a lot of the time you just end up
accidentally deactivating them or
activating them anyway so there's your
microphone and headphone three pole
three-and-a-half millimeter jacks
there's where they split apart another
nice little Sennheiser logo and as we've
come to expect from Sennheiser
headphones a nice long cable so this
gives you all the options in the world
in terms of routing so you can kind of
go around and behind your stuff and then
bring it around to the back of your
computer and you're going to have ample
space to you know sit here which is
where it presumably would be if you were
gaming we might as well do a sneak peek
at what will be my finished gaming rig
you're going to want to come on the
other side of me here b-roll so there
you go I'll be doing a video about this
soon the only thing that's missing is I
still have to add a couple more sticks
of RAM and then it will be pretty much
done thank you for checking out this
unboxing and first look at the PC 350 se
from Sennheiser I think they took the
approach of if it ain't broke don't fix
it made a couple small tweaks and I
think the the changes that they have
made are very positive don't forget to
