brought to you by western digital Intel
and steel series hey guys we're here at
Galaxy at the Indy mega booth just
checking out their game and I had to
stop by because it looks so much fun
this looks like asteroids but way later
with all the advancements that it should
have had what can you tell me about this
game so this is a culmination of years
of dumb shooter kind of experience and
shooter inspiration I guess put together
so I mean it obviously looks like a
classic 16-bit shooter game but it's
actually under the hood it's much more
like a modern shooter it's much more
like something like far cry 3 where
you've got you know very dedicated AI
very dedicated physics the explosions
and stuff all have actually physics
bombs will send guys off flying the AI
we've teamed up with a company called
sentian there are new hardware or a new
software company they're making
middleware for AI for really high-end AI
and so we've got that plugged into the
game where this is more like it really
is something similar to like far cry 3
in 2d these guys have vision cones they
can hear you they're out on random
patrols looking for you if they hear
something fishy they'll go into an
investigation mode if they locate you
they'll call for backup I'm very good at
like pinning their fire down on you
getting you in a trial position and like
taking you down the weaker guys will
stay out they let the the bigger guys
come in after you it's not a shooting
game where you just pop them a couple
times and they go down I mean some of
the bigger guys it's like a real
drawn-out heavy duty combat so I love
modern combat stuff like I love halo I
love far cry 3 and we really wanted to
get that feeling of just like ass
intense combat experience perfect outer
space dog fighting into this game it
looks like you're looking through the
lens of a classic 16-bit you know space
computer but it's very much not a shmup
it's not a twin-stick shooter it's an
action-adventure game it's very combat
focused and that's great in dropping
names for AI like far cry 3 is big but
if I had and if I hadn't seen the
gameplay so far I would kind of look at
you in an interesting way but I've seen
it I've seen what you're talking about
you're definitely completely right some
interesting things that I just saw a few
seconds ago was actually he was hiding
behind a rock and the AI was not able to
find him because he wasn't shooting for
one so I couldn't track down his shots
and he wasn't using his his boost so
they couldn't hear his boost that's
really interesting you don't usually see
AI elements like that in a game like
this what's it's awesome that you called
that out what other mechanics core
mechanics do you find in this game
um it's we kind of compared a lots of
ice hockey where you're you know you're
very aggressively moving around but you
need to be as good moving backwards as
you are forwards so they've got forward
thrusters side thrusters back brusters
you know you've got a very finite level
of control over the ship so you're like
boosting around shooting backwards is a
big thing like you fly up on a guy
laying into him you can jump over in for
a second out of the gameplay plane land
on the other side still facing him and
lay into him as you're boosting
backwards and then you like LA County
with your missiles and let them have it
you know the combat is just very intense
it's super engaging and it's it's
organic and it's evolving all the time
so every combat experience is different
and it's always engaging one thing that
I've noticed about the indie mega movie
so far is a lot of the games here just
make you feel like a badass while you're
playing them and being able to flip over
people and jump all over the place and
lock on missiles and dance around and
dodge around a boss and hide behind
rocks and all those kinda stuff is just
so cool because you're very active into
the game it's it's a game that has a
story but while you're really really
action based the entire time anyways and
talking about a game that has a story
what is the setting for this game so
setting is deep space you're part of the
kind of the Human Alliance you know here
Earth Federation I gotta come up the
cool name which I haven't done yet but
you're you're in deep space and there's
a terrible ambushed by the enemy
Imperials and the fleet is basically
devastated and you are like one of the
last fighters you're kind of a green
pilot you don't have much experience the
guy who owned the ship that you're in
was actually killed on the deck when
they got hit so he jumped into one the
last remaining fighters got out you can
see the beginning of the at the intro he
sort of has a big battle there he kind
of barely gets his way out of it and
gets knocked out and goes flying off at
the deep space he's picked up later by
one of the last remaining sort of mega
craft and he's the last fighter so she's
like get back here you know and so he
did you get back to the ship and you
have to kind of start you know exploring
the galaxy mining for resources powering
back up your mother ship and being able
to jump further and further as you're
repairing your ship you know you're very
outgunned you're very out man so it's
this sort of you know going out on these
missions doing some recon finding
supplies bringing it back to the ship
powering it up and then being able to
move on to further levels yeah like
you're talking you money for resources
finding all these supplies all this kind
of stuff another thing I notices you can
blow up the rocks and you can blow up
shipwrecks to loot things what kind of
stuff is someone expecting to find in
these objects well these ships are the
wreckage of Geno giant star fighters
that have been destroyed in these
battles
there's all kinds of supplies on board
there's health packs there's a you know
fuel upgrades there's missile upgrades
there's all kinds of stuff to upgrade
your ship and move on you're looking for
the warp crystals which are really
powerful for your engines to get back
online so you guys can warp further and
further trying to get home through
deeply occupied in my enemy space it's
you know thinking something like
borderlands 2 where you're upgrading
your weapons you're upgrading your
abilities you know metroid is a huge
inspiration for this obviously so that's
sort of you know just this genuine long
ramp up of just getting better and
getting new abilities and powering up
and feeling like a badass the whole time
a great a great reference i just made
borderlands 2 the loot hungry person in
so many gamers I've noticed will enjoy
this game because while you're dodging
around while you're actively fighting
while you're trying to lock on missiles
while you're doing all that stuff you're
always blowing up rocks and blowing up
shipwrecks and I was going stuff and
also getting all these little objects
like you're talking about the warp the
warp core thing that you're just talking
about that's that's great now as we can
see in the background that there's giant
enemies and earlier we saw one of the
reviewers playing and there was what
seemed like a boss chasing him around
and that took a long time but once he
got stuck in a corner and was like okay
this is it everyone saw him lock on
missiles just blow everything away is
there is there more like boss style
enemies in this game yes there's gonna
be some very large enemies to take down
here you know you may need to take on
with a friend where you're going to be
working on sort of the network
multiplayer like what that looks like
yet we haven't really done any testing
but we got some big ideas you know we're
still like I said we're about a year out
still so we've got a lot of work to do
but we intend to have the you know tiny
enemies all the way up to massive scale
stuff like really dynamic epic space
drama that's great I'd like to see that
you're almost a year out and I know it's
a kind of not the biggest demo ever but
it's very polished as far as I've seen
so that's great i'm really excited to
see where you guys can take this in a
year I know you guys are all about
innovation so I'm expecting fully to see
a few extra things I know you said you
haven't even named part of the game yet
which is great because in a year from
now that'll be named and there'll be
other stuff in the game very excited so
anything else you want to add on I mean
I just hope people can come by the booth
this weekend and check it out if not you
know we'll be launching on ps4 and on
steam we have high hopes for the game we
think I mean the response has been
phenomenal this weekend everyone loves
it and we're just having a fantastic
time this has been a great weekend so
thanks for coming down
and thank you for showing me the game if

the indie mega booth or any of our
