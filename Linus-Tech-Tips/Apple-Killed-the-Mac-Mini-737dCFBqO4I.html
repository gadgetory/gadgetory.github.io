Mini the first words out of my mouth
were make it bigger and I actually
wasn't the only one so I got myself all
pumped up to be like yo so it's not so
many anymore is it you know what we
should just call it the Mac but but as
it turns out they actually didn't make
it bigger it's just been so long since
Apple has updated them pack mini that
either you think of this or this or this
which is the original Mac Mini not this
I guess we've just been spoiled by the
Intel nook and all the third-party
derivatives but so you know what I'm
actually gonna stick with it this
product shouldn't be called the Mac Mini
it should be called the Mac but that
might not be a bad thing
speaking of Mac our sponsor Mac Weldon
Mac Weldon makes great underwear
t-shirts socks wallets and more they
believe in simple shopping and if you
use to code tech tips you'll get 20% off
at the link below
so we stumbled upon the first reason
that this is a Mac not a Mac Mini during
the ordering process
unlike previous Mac Mini models the 2018
Mac is not cheap
it starts at $7.99 for the quad-core
experience with a piddly eight gigs of
RAM and 128 gigs of storage now
obviously I'm no pleb so I poked around
on the ordering page some more and ended
up ponying up for the second reason that
this is a Mac the desktop class 6 core
processor option yes my friends starting
at 1099 us you can get the same
performance as your DIY PC building
chump roommate in a device this big the
unboxing experience certainly was pretty
legendary but things were looking up
from there and isn't it beautiful the
thing weighs only about 3 pounds and is
completely clean aside from the glossy
Apple logo on the top oh well around
back we've got this air vent that apple
says doubles air flow over the last gen
and above the i/o which impressively is
nearly identical to the iMac pro and
includes four Thunderbolt three ports
which have all kinds of uses display USB
external docks whatever we've got HDMI
USB a and a headphone jack hey is that
where they've been keeping them anyway
what we've also got is the main event
for me right here a 10 gigabit
networking port and this is not only
available on the Mac but even reasonably
priced at about a hundred bucks for the
upgrade so now we can finally edit 8k
footage over the network without needing
an iMac Pro or an expensive Thunderbolt
2 10 gigabit networking adapter so why
don't we do it
ah Mac OS my old friend Mac OS not my
favorite in no small part though due to
my lack of familiarity with it but to
its credit it's actually remarkably
smooth on this machine with its mere
eight gigs of ram with that said the
experience isn't all it could be with a
more reasonable amount of system memory
and I've got some good news with about
half an hour and a handy dandy guide off
of I fix it
anyone with a screwdriver should be able
to perform a memory upgrade on the
twenty eighteen Mac remember that's what
I'm calling it by themselves so I called
in a friend to help me out he knows all
about disassembling Apple products it's
actually easier than you might think to
get inside this thing you just need the
right tools here are the steps the
bottom lid just pops right off the
antenna plate is just a few screws make
sure though that you mark where the
larger ones go for reassembly later you
unscrew the Wi-Fi connector and
carefully pry it up then unscrew the fan
pry its connector up and remove it these
two cables need to be carefully removed
then you can take out the two large TR
ten screws that keep the motherboard
fastened to the chassis give the rear
i/o plate a gentle push and it'll pop up
and then out there's a cage around the
RAM to reduce the mi but forty six
screws later and we have regular old
sodium slots just repeat this process in
Reverse once the run is in and you're
done but I have some bad news too
remember how I mentioned that you should
buy as much storage as you will need
when you order yeah about that so the
let's call them rumors about Apple
blocking and third party operating
systems from the Mac Mini and other t2
chip enabled devices turns out to be
false but only from a literal standpoint
thanks to the t2 chip Linux isn't
blocked from booting only from
installing so if you fire it up into
recovery mode and disable secure boot
you can still boot Linux if you're into
that even with the t2 chip but without
access to the internal storage so we're
booted back up here let's go into about
this boom there it is 32 gigs of DDR 4
memory so at least the ram upgrade
worked and this was just with random
memory that we had lying around in our
warehouse so all that's left now then is
to see how the 2018 mac stacks up with
the competition in terms of its
performance we're gonna test it
alongside the MacBook Pro 2018 the
MacBook Air 2018 a Hades Canyon nook and
a similarly priced desktop PC also while
we aren't focusing on games today we're
gonna throw a few in there just to round
out our testing as one might expect
well relying on integrated graphics does
the Mac no favors even at 720p medium
details it absolutely chugs in shadow of
the Tomb Raider meaning that you're
basically Sol for all but eSports titles
and even then it's not a great
experience until you plug in an external
GPU via Thunderbolt 3 just bear in mind
though that only AMD graphics cards are
officially supported in Mac OS anyway
that's not why you're buying a Mac and
when it comes to productivity thankfully
the Mac here occupies a niche much
closer to the 2018 MacBook Pro than the
2018 MacBook Air thanks to its hefty CPU
horsepower but while it does beat out
our Hades Canyon nook in CPU performance
it sadly doesn't come close in GPU and
loses out entirely to our similarly
priced stock desktop except actually for
one case where Mac OS is aggressive
boost factors in though this lack of
performance compared to a full-size
desktop would be a much bigger problem
in our eyes if it wasn't for the Mac's
diminutive form factor speaking of which
by the way it does have a reasonable
looking ventilation hole but it got
really hot like really hot while it was
working hard like over 90 degrees hot
which comes a
little too close to literally smoking
the competition for our liking
I mean stock chips start to throttle
around 85 degrees or so and yeah the Mac
manages to keep it going
above base clock with surprisingly
minimal noise so that's good but
remember it's got that t2 chip that
we're all familiar with by now so if
some component of your system dies a
heat death or the board flexes or
something especially as dust accumulates
inside over the years
remember Apple might not upgrade this
thing for four years so even if you buy
on every release cycle at least the good
news is that it sips power compared to
our desktop I'm just saying I would
recommend setting up Time Machine just
to be safe which honestly is a pretty
good way to sum up the whole experience
one giant asterisk yeah it's a small Mac
but you're gonna have to deal with no
dedicated GPU when similarly priced kits
have them yes it's fast but it's thermal
solution while improved is not designed
for sustained loads yes its upgradable
and cleanable but only if you have the
right tools and that upgradable thing it
only applies to RAM not the internal
storage that has held ransom by the t2
chip like it really seems like Apple
designed this new generation of Mac with
something like Final Cut or Adobe
Premiere in mind where the IGP can
accelerate some of the transcoding work
and then the CPU cores themselves can
handle the much bursty ur timeline
editing work that's even more apparent
with the inclusion of 10 gig Ethernet
for connecting to a high-speed Nats
though we're not saying that's the only
thing it could be used for because on
that subject you could actually use this
thing as a high-speed Ness thanks to
that 10 gig Ethernet though for the
price and considering that you'd need a
separate Thunderbolt enclosure for true
mass storage well yeah it's not a great
value in spite of the compromises though
per Apple tradition there's nothing in
this form factor that quite matches the
capability and the connectivity of the
2018 Mac
and the price while higher isn't
entirely outlandish either so if you
need its unique blend of form and
function or if you just plain need a Mac
and don't feel like paying more to have
a screen pre attached to it seriously
actually this occurred to us only while
we were finalizing the script for this
video this is the only thing that runs
Mac OS and doesn't include a screen that
has been refreshed by Apple in the last
five years anyway it's a pretty neat
little machine just make sure you keep
regular backups of all of your files
though I mean that's a pretty good
advice across the board speaking of good
advice our sponsor Squarespace if you
