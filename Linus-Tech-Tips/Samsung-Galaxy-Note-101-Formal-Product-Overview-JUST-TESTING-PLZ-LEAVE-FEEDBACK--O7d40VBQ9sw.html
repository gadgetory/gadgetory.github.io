ram 16 gigs of internal storage and an
expansion slot using microSD the Galaxy
Note 10.1 features all of the amenities
of a modern tablet and more it comes
with a stylus with a 10.1 inch pls 1280
by 800 display the Galaxy Note 10.1 is
perfectly capable of playing back HD
content whether it's videos that are
stored locally or on YouTube the front
of the unit is really clean you've got
two stereo speakers a light sensor and a
1.7 megapixel front camera and other
than that you don't see a whole lot else
on the top we find all of the i/o from
this tablet we've got the power switch
the volume rocker the microSD slot and
ir emitter which is cool a headphone
jack but on the sides there's nothing
this is great if you want to use the
tablet while you're lying in bed for
example you want to rest it on something
without crushing your headphone jack
like I've seen on other tablets in the
past very good choice from Samsung on
the bottom you've got a microphone port
as well as the power plug in and on the
back you find the 5 megapixel camera the
built-in flash and then just an overall
clean aesthetic other than that on the
very bottom the stylus I talked about
before the ir emitter makes this tablet
very unique all we had to do was select
the brand of television turn on the
Samsung TV and we are able to use the
note 10.1 as a universal remote it does
have the option for other brands of TVs
so you are not locked into just using a
samsung one now there are literally
dozens of choices out there but Samsung
differentiates with the software that
they include as well as key features
like the ir emitter and the built-in
stylus so we're going to use the stylus
to quickly show you how you can use the
built in photoshop touch software to
apply cool effects to your photos such
as changing it from a normal photo into
a comic style just with your tablet it
takes about that long pop up Play allows
you to keep watching videos in the
foreground while you're working on other
things in the background which is great
for multitasking and the included
Polaris Office application allows you to
easily edit documents spreadsheets and
slides on your tablet itself Samsung's
TouchWiz software over top of the
Android
stock interface enables you to much more
easily multitask and manage your tablet
I think that pretty much covers it thank
you for checking out this episode I'm
