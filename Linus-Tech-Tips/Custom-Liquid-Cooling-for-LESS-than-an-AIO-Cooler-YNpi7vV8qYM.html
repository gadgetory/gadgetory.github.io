liquid cooling loop for less than an AI
Oh cooler clickbait clickbait not true
but wait no it's true
for $52 and 21 cents with prime shipping
on amazon.com I obtained everything I
will need to build a custom water
cooling loop for my CPU now what kind of
hardware did he find for that kind of a
price that's a great question and I'm
going to show you this is gonna be a
good one
verdaguer gonna make a sand plus lines
of gaming chairs make for a great
addition to any gaming setup check them
out at the link in the video description
okay let's run through what we've got
here now I'm going to tell you guys
right off the hop that shopping for
these is not particularly easy the AGP
Tech 12 pipe aluminum heat exchanger
radiator for PC for example did not even
include the specs of what size the barbs
are and actually looking at the picture
telling the difference between quarter
inch and three eighths inch Barb's is
not that easy but hey for 1699 I'm
feeling pretty good about this purchase
alright next up is the pump this is not
what was in the picture so if this works
then great it's rated at 240 liters per
hour flow with three meters of Maxx head
theoretically plenty no connector or
anything but we'll solve that problem
later and finally the centerpiece of my
water cooling loop this thing same thing
man amazon needs like a like a like a
scale next to pictures on their site
because look at this
Lois product page looks pretty big right
in person the lengths pure red copper
water cooling block for CPU graphics
radiator heatsink 40 by 40 millimeter
which I guess should have tipped me off
is this dinky little thing before we get
started there are a few more things that
we
NEADS so first of all i scrounged up
some tubing a mixture of 1/4 inch and
3/8 this can be obtained very cheaply so
it doesn't affect the price of our setup
much and a couple of 3/8 to quarter inch
reducers as well as a 3/8 inch key
because we don't want to waste money on
a budget project like this on a
dedicated reservoir we'll show you how
to use that later next up we'll need our
soldering iron why is the sponge missing
for this why why we will need our drill
we'll need a sacrificial molex connector
a sacrificial case side panel and we
need some screws along with anything
else that I realized that I forgotten
along the way is there any PC that's not
totally missed the wine show PC I'll use
my Franken cooling solution on the LAN
show PC so in order to do that we will
need a baseline reading for the
temperatures with the Noctua NH
something not d9l that's in there right
now in HD 9 whatever the cooler that's
in there right now to compare against
our custom liquid cooling so check this
out
61 degrees on the cpu let's see if we
can beat that shell
every
our $25 special does not come with any
mounting hardware whatsoever we're gonna
need a hold down plate it's gonna be the
ghetto sort in case any of you were
wondering we're gonna Center this baby
by eyeball I'm gonna find a bit it's big
enough for these babies to come through
Oh Oh the eyeballing it system works
again I mean it's like if I it's like if
art was more beautiful my screws go 8:30
to 8:30 to wash room or or stick with me
here a zillion washers one zillion
washers now presumably you should find
like some plastic junker you could use a
proper length screw and that would solve
this problem for you but I'm nothing if
not willing to do things entirely the
wrong way for the sake of finishing this
video right now
that was probably a lot of thermal
compound oh yeah 20 washers right there
20 raw washers is the magic number
arguably this is a bit of a hack for me
to say the cost is $52 and and whatever
because I did not factor in the cost of
a fan for the radiator but I also don't
think it's an entirely unfair assumption
that if you have a computer it probably
has a 120 millimeter fan in it somewhere
so we're going to repurpose the one
that's in the case I don't even think
the product page specified that this was
a 120 millimeter radiator but it would
appear as though the spacing is correct
nice that looks legit right so when
you're using a crappy pump it's more
important to carefully plan out the
position of everything within the loop
so that you're able to bleed the air
bubbles out
because a super-powerful pump will just
blow them through but a crappy one will
not be able to do that now the reason I
chose this pump had everything to do
with placement and size nothing to do
with cost which if you remember from the
intro of this video isn't outright lie
let's keep it really simple
not drill any more holes and let's mount
it on the bottom right here so next
order of business is we need some kind
of PC compatible connector on our pump
because it just straight up doesn't come
with one because whatever right only all
kinds of stripping where this easy I
wouldn't have to make youtube videos
that's the key to good stripping use
your teeth okay a couple minutes later
boom molex connector there we go pump is
powered the radiator is three eighths
inch so that's where I need to use wait
a minute oh well I was just saying we
needed a snag it is not 3/8 inch it's
like a really ginormous quarter-inch
which is actually terrible because my
quarter inch tubing is super old and was
not particularly pliable in the first
place
okay fortunately I have this nor Priene
tubing that I ripped off of some Swift
tech thing a long time ago Shoop
so positioning of the tea line very
important because when we fill it we
want it to go straight down to the inlet
of the pump and when there are air
bubbles we want them to make their way
out so it has to be at the highest point
yesh in the loop actually up here might
have been a little bit better but we're
not going to stress about these minor
minor details keep in mind that normally
I would put zip ties on these Barb's but
this is a very short-term solution so
I'm not going to bother
I would also normally cut this tubing to
a reasonable length but this is
expensive tubing and so I'm going to
save it so let's go ahead and let some
of that water work its way into the
system here so I think I'm about to have
a bit of a bit of a witness me moment
here because this is quite possibly the
jane kia sting i have ever done on Linus
tech tips what you guys are about to see
I need a faster way to do this not a
recommended way a faster way so we are
going to put this computer on a little
front leg - and actually this one
mistake I mean everything about this was
a mistake but this in particular filling
the glass tower over mistake oh that's
why I wanted the glass full now remember
thinking thinking it doesn't look like
I'm thinking but I assure you I am oh no
no no no no okay okay are good
theoretically it is now full it's loud
as all hell but I realized why we
probably have a postcode there's no
graphics card in there so like we could
still get away with this we're gonna
have to give it some time but this is
looking very promising it might be loud
it might be janky and it might be ugly
but Dennett it outperforms a decent
aftermarket cooler coming in a whopping
five degrees cooler after an extended
stress FPU load in I 264 so thank you
guys for coming along for the ride
whether you believed in me from the
start or whether you were a hater a
member of the corrupt media and I bid
you goodnight this Black Friday be sure

which you should totally join now that
you're done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so
hey it's been a long time since we did
this so let me check out whole room
water cooling if you haven't had enough
of me gently trying to water cool things
for today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
