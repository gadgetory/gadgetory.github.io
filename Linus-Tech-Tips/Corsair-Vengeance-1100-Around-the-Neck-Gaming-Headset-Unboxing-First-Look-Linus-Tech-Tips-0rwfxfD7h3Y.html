corsair vengeance 1100 gaming
communication headset what I really
think they mean to say is gaming headset
because no headset for gaming is not for
communication so it's a little redundant
but I get where they're coming from
online gaming and chat without standing
comfort now that is a very interesting
point because even though this is my
first unboxing and it is my first
encounter with the retail package for
the Vengeance 1100 I have had the
pleasure of listening to one already
down at the course our headquarters and
I'm going to go ahead and spoil the
surprise the thing is freaking awesome
considering the price point it's
lightweight actually which happens to be
the very first word on the back as far
as what Corsair has to say about it
lightweight behind the head design for
outstanding comfort during long sessions
online it is also extremely good
sounding so it features 40 millimeter
drivers and high sensitivity noise
cancelling cardioid microphone for clear
unambiguous voice communication ok
digital USB and three and a half mil
analog connectors which is awesome
considering the price point once again
and is compatible with PCs laptops and
sound cards I think what they mean by
sound cards is pcs why at the analog
connection so laptops they're intending
you to use the USB connection because
let's face it almost every laptop in the
world has terrible terrible sound and
then for your pc depending on whether
you're using onboard sound or whether
you are using a dedicated sound card
you're going to want to go with the USB
for your onboard sound replacement and
then you're going to want to go with
those analog jacks if you already have a
decent dedicated sound card so wow this
is very challenging there we go
and good riddance to you packaging
alright oh look at that it comes a
little carrying case of course hey I
think this is the same as their power
supply one hold on let me see if a power
supply if it's in it hold on hold on got
a power supply here there's an ax 850
power supply and no it would appear
Corsair has actually redesigned the
Corsair bag to fit things other than
power supplies more specifically the
Vengeance 1100 headset so let's start
with you know what let's not start with
the headset itself i'm just going to put
these on here and let's start with the
features overall so we have first of all
let's go all the way down the cord to
find all of the relevant features hold
on a second i think i got it on it's a
little bit wrong here there we go that's
where the ears are supposed to go so the
first thing we find down the very
flexible very nice braided cord is
volume control as well as a mic mute so
be careful with that oh we actually ha
check this out this is like the littlest
thing that nobody ever thought of before
at least I haven't seen it before look
at that seek green green red which one
do you think is on and which one do you
think is off how many people have not
been able to tell when glancing down at
their inline control whether their mic
is on or whether it's muted which could
be relevant like you know ah you know oh
hey guys BRB mom I can't come up for
dinner I'm raiding you know and then you
yelled that in everyone's ear because
you couldn't tell if you're Mike was
viewed muted or not so there you go now
that problem solved so we're gonna keep
going down this nice long cord here
features in line cable management so
there you go there's your little velcro
strap that you can use to bundle it up
if you so desire here's where the one
splits into two where we get our analog
connections so there's your microphone
there is your headphone jack and then
finally we have the USB sound card so
there this is e see another thing that
it's just insane that nobody ever
thought of before but here's corsair day
look at this it has the diagrams on both
sides amazing see it doesn't cost more
when you're molding a plastic piece like
this to label it better but for some
reason everyone only labels one side and
leaves the other side
blank but now now that they've done it
now that they've invested in their own
piece of plastic it'll be unique and
it'll be better forever all right here's
the USB plug so that's what you plug
into your laptop or whatever else the
case may be I mean if you're going to
use your you know iPod or iPhone or
whatever else then you obviously won't
need that so go ahead so you plug that
in there it's compatible with anything
that features a headphone jack that's
pretty much it i'm not actually going to
play anything on it right now but let's
have a look at the headphones themselves
so water why don't I why don't I just
model them for you here for a little bit
here guys that dramatic enough okay here
I'll take them off for a minute so
features as I mentioned before a very
light weight behind the head design so
there's your little coarser logo there's
your chromed accents this is going to
rest on the back of your neck and check
this out once again another smart thing
that's evidently nobody ever thought of
and that well actually okay i'm not a
headphone i'm not an over-the-air
headphone experts and maybe someone else
thought of this but you got nice
rubberized grip e stuff going all the
way around the inside of the headset but
what that means is it is extremely
comfortable and wherever you put it it
tends to just sort of it tends to just
sort of stay like it kind of it kind of
holds on to you there okay you can also
i'll check this out this goes how many
degrees that looks like 270 degrees
around so you can actually tuck it way
back way over here or you can put it up
here if you want to look like you have a
little antenna or you can put it down
here in front of your mouth if you want
to talk i'm not sure if this is flexible
it turns out it is course our thinks of
everything so you can either move it
away from your mouth everyone says hey
your voice yeah it's time to give your
volume is too high you don't have time
to adjust your volume you're too busy
gaming just move it away from your mouth
little bit BAM problem fixed right okay
but otherwise normally you would just
put it there ok let's go keep going
around the overall design of it so
you've got a nice brushed metal finished
look here on the coarser logo you've got
your microphone is ported actually on
both sides check that out there you go
and then this part as I showed you
before is quite flexible as well alright
and then the 4000 k okay other side we
got a Corsair logo we got some blue
accents to go along with the other blue
and chromium Italy accents it's a really
sharp looking little unit
and then finally we have the secret
which is the secret not only to the
sound quality but also the comfort and
that is the 40 ml drivers surrounded by
what is this hold on is this memory foam
okay they are not saying its memory foam
so it's probably not i'm sure they would
say it if it was but that is really nice
phone here cameraman feel the phone that
feel like more comfortable than normal
phone camera man says yes he also agrees
with me so i think that's actually
pretty much it that's the Vengeance 1100
