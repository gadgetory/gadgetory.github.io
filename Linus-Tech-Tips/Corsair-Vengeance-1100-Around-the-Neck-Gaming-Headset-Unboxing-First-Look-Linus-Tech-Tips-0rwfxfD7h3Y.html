Corsair Vengeance 1100 gaming
communication headset what I really
think they mean to say is gaming headset
because no headset for gaming is not for
communication so it's a little redundant
but I get where they're coming from
online gaming and chat without standing
comfort now that is a very interesting
point because even though this is my
first unboxing and it is my first
encounter with the retail package for
the Vengeance 1100 I have had the
pleasure of listening to one already
down at the course our headquarters and
I'm gonna go ahead and spoil the
surprise the thing is freaking awesome
considering the price point it's
lightweight actually which happens to be
the very first word on the back as far
as what Corsair has to say about it
lightweight behind the head design for
outstanding comfort during long sessions
online it is also extremely good
sounding so it features 40 millimeter
drivers and high sensitivity noise
canceling cardioid microphone for clear
unambiguous voice communication okay
Digital USB and three and a half mil
analog connectors which is awesome
considering the price point once again
and is compatible with PCs laptops and
sound cards I think what they mean by
sound cards is pcs I have the analog
connection so laptops there intending
you to use the USB connection because
let's face it almost every laptop in the
world has terrible terrible sound and
then for your PC depending on whether
you're using onboard sound or whether
you are using a dedicated sound card
you're gonna want to go with the USB for
your onboard sound replacement and then
you're gonna want to go with those
analog jacks
if you already have a decent dedicated
sound card so wow this is very
challenging
and good riddance to you packaging all
right oh look at that it comes with a
little carrying case and of course hey I
think this is the same as their power
supply one hold on let me see it's a
power supply if it's in it hold on hold
on got a power supply here there's an ax
850 power supply and no what a pier
Corsair has actually redesigned the
Corsair bag to fit things other than
power supplies more specifically the
Vengeance 1100 headset so let's start
with you know what let's not start with
the headset itself I'm just gonna put
these on here and let's start with the
features overall so we have first of all
let's go all the way down the cord to
find all of the irrelevant features hold
on a second I think I got it on it's a
little bit wrong here there we go
that's where the ears are supposed to go
so the first thing we find down the very
flexible very nice braided cord is
volume control as well as a mic mute so
be careful with that Oh actually ha
check this out this is like the littlest
thing that nobody ever thought of before
at least I haven't seen it before look
at that seat Green Green red which one
do you think is on and which one do you
think is off how many people have not
been able to tell when glancing down at
their inline control whether their mic
is on or whether it's muted which could
be relevance like you know uh
you know oh hey guys BRB mom I can't
come up for dinner I'm raiding you know
and then you yelled that in everyone's
ear because you couldn't tell if your
mic was of you didn't mute it or not so
there you go now that problem solved so
we're gonna keep going down this nice
long cord here features inline cable
management so there you go there's your
little velcro strap that you can use to
bundle it up if you so desire here's
where the one splits into two where we
get our analog connections so there's
your microphone there is your headphone
jack and then finally we have the USB
soundcard so there this isn't say
another thing that it's just insane that
nobody ever thought of before but here's
Corsair today look at this it has the
diagrams on both sides amazing see it
doesn't cost more when you're molding a
plastic piece like this to label it
better but for some reason everyone
only labels one side and leaves the
other side blank but now now that
they've done it now that they've
invested in their own piece of plastic
it'll be unique and it'll be better
forever all right here's the USB plug so
that's what you plug into your laptop or
whatever else the case may be I mean if
you're gonna use your you know iPod or
iPhone or whatever else then you
obviously won't need that so I'm gonna
go ahead and see put that in there it's
compatible with anything that features a
headphone jack that's pretty much it I'm
not actually gonna play anything on it
right now but let's have a look at the
headphones themselves so why don't why
don't I why don't I just model them for
you here for a little bit here guys that
dramatic enough okay
yeah I'll take them off for a minute so
features as they I'm ention before a
very lightweight behind the head design
so there's your little coarser logo
there's your chromed accents this is
gonna rest on the back here and neck and
check this out once again another smart
thing that's evidently nobody ever
thought of and that well actually okay
I'm not a headphone I'm not an
over-the-air headphone experts and maybe
someone else thought of this but you got
nice rubberized grip easy stuff going
all the way around the inside of the
headset so what that means is it is
extremely comfortable and wherever you
put it it tends to just sort of it tends
to just sort of stay like it kind of it
kind of holds on to you there okay you
can also I'll check this out
this goes how many degrees that looks
like 270 degrees around so you can
actually tuck it way back way over here
or you can put it up here if you want to
look like you have a little antenna or
you can put it down here in front of
your mouth if you want to talk I'm not
sure if this is flexible it turns out it
is course are thinks of everything so
you can either move it away from your
mouth everyone says hey your voice yeah
then it's time to be your volume is too
high you don't have time to adjust your
volume you're too busy gaming just move
it away from your mouth little bit BAM
problem fixed right okay but otherwise
normally you would just put it there
okay let's go keep going around the
overall design of it so you've got a
nice brushed metal finished look here on
the Corsair logo you've got your
microphone is ported actually on both
sides check that out there you go and
then this part as I showed you before is
quite flexible as well all right and
then the 40 mm okay okay other side
we've got a Corsair logo we've got some
blue accents to go along with the other
blue and
me mentally accents it's a really sharp
looking little unit and then finally we
have the secret which is the secret not
only to the sound quality but also the
comfort and that is the 40 ml driver's
surrounded by what this is hold on is
this memory foam okay they're not saying
it's memory foam so it's probably not
I'm sure they would say it if it was but
that is really nice phone here cameraman
feel the foam that feel like more
comfortable than normal foam cameraman
says yes he also agrees with me so I
think that's actually pretty much it
that's the Vengeance 1,100 thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
and don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from Ron boxing's reviews and
other computer videos yeah hold on hold
on it's not quite right yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
