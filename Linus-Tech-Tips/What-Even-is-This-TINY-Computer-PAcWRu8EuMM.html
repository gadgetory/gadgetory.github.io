so GPD is the company best known for
well really this actually oh you know
what no I even have oh you guys are
gonna see a this is our stream cart and
this is Jake
he runs the stream cart no check this
out over here over here no you could
have stayed right where you were this
right here is the GPD
whatever the crap yeah this is the
pocket pocket too if I recall correctly
and I use this thing for whatever I need
like kind of a computer but also I don't
care if it takes me a long time to get
anything done because the the interface
on it is kind of kludgy okay
well that's kind of what GPD is known
for they've got like more gaming
oriented devices they've got more
consumer oriented devices like that one
over there
and then this well this is one with
really really weird positioning so we've
got an early advanced unit here you can
see even the IndieGoGo campaign isn't
live yet now normally we actually don't
really even talk about anything that's
Kickstarter or IndieGoGo or crowdfunded
because you know the track records for
these companies for delivering on what
they're promised on what they promised
yeah they're not great however gpb's
actually kind of been around a while and
they've successfully delivered quite a
few crowdfunded products at this point
so I'm not too worried about it and this
is the Micro PC the business-oriented
mini PC so come on over come on come on
come on let's have a look at this thing
so first there's their positioning for
it so you can see this isn't even live
yet it'll be up soon I actually don't
know what the pricing is but in terms of
I'll go through the specs later but I
want to talk about sort of what they
think this is for in the fields of
network communication electric power
exploration mining archaeology education
training manufacturing service chain
call center business services
public institutions government military
and many more this is the perfect
alternative to traditional notebooks and
it is adaptive to extreme conditions so
then they proceed to compare it to the
surface go it is much better than
Microsoft Surface go which they say has
been kind of dubbed an iPad pro killer
ok so then they figure if they're better
than the surface go they are by
extension better than the iPad pro so
let's go ahead here so they compare to
the surface go so there we've got a
seller on an 4100 I'm gonna go ahead and
plug in my power brick here so this is
just a little what does this thing 5
volts 3 amps 9 volt 2.67 12 volt 2 amp
it's one of those quick quick charging
adapters here go ahead and plug that in
so it's got a seller on an 4100 which is
4 cores 4 threads at anywhere between 1
gigahertz and that that's at 2,000 I
actually have a way more ghetto spec
sheet but one that's actually probably
more useful for this particular thing
come on really there we go
1 gigahertz to 2.4 gigahertz so that's
Gemini Lake
we've got does that need something oh
it's Nick what can I do for you Nick
we're live streaming what even is tiny
computer is that what it's called you
know what I love it leave it leave it no
I love it
no Jake that's an executive order leave
it the way it is no I demand you change
it back what even is tiny computer yes
yeah Oh beautiful
good work good work Jake I've way too
much fun with these lives changes it's
great alright ah let's get this thing up
right I didn't run through the specs so
it's got eight gigs of lpddr4
oh wait really no four gigs of lpddr4
memory it's got 128 gigs of n dot to
storage not nvme mind you just regular
and to storage it's got AC wireless it's
got you know I mean I don't know this is
only a 720p display but it should be
noted that at this size honestly that
doesn't really matter like if you come
in and have a look at this thing like it
looks quite sharp
like here if we bring up let's just
bring up a browser oh oh oh we do have
another browser oh thank goodness one
second here I'm sorry yeah if we bring
up a browser here let's go ahead and
have a look at some text like it looks
pretty good not as good as their devices
that I've seen before in fact I believe
the one over on my desk actually has a
1080p screen or it might even be 1920 by
1200 don't don't quote me on that but
it's definitely usable it's got Gorilla
Glass 4 but unlike everything else I've
ever seen from these guys it does not
appear to be a touchscreen so you are
actually expected to navigate on this
thing like this so you've got your
trackpad here searching much glare on
the screen are you good David good all
right so you got your trackpad here and
then you've got your left and right and
your middle click over here so you go
ahead and is chrome gonna launch that
moment when edge wins by default
can we oh it's got a click pad oh maybe
that's why my clicks weren't registering
or maybe it's just slow because even
faster than a surface go does not
necessarily a fast one make it
performance there's a mouse no no I'm
I'm gonna have the experience that they
expect archaeologists to have in the
field here oh I'm sure the keyboard is
mushy I mean okay so okay what is going
on here it keeps kind of miss
registering my clicks one thing to note
is that I don't want to judge it
necessarily too hard based on its state
right now this is a pre-production unit
but also I do have to say GPD that you
could have done probably a slightly
better job here oh yeah it's a little
much testing okay can you look away
while I enter my password at that moment
when you're live streaming and yeah
nice I like it good work David she's got
sass this is why we like mr. goat yeah
let's go ahead and expand this what is
going on
it keeps registering phantom clicks Lee
are you messing with me
is there a wife wireless dongle in here
okay no no I took it out I took it I
think I took it out no I don't think so
see that's it
okay all right all right just okay try
to let's try to reset it you know just
chill out okay all right I just know it
doesn't rent crisis it doesn't run
crisis okay okay all right well they're
gonna need some time to sort out that
trackpad thing for sure if it runs
anything like that I will not be
impressed let's go ahead and have a look
here so our CPU now originally they
SPECT this thing for six watts but we
actually just got Jake just installed it
today some kind of like a firmware
update or something BIOS update some
like that an easy update that's going to
increase it to 10 watts which means we
should see actually like pretty decent
important performance so we've got 10
watts 4 threads up to 2 point whatever
gigahertz 1.1 gigahertz base that
actually says here and why don't we
start with a good old-fashioned
Cinebench right let's do it percussive
maintenance yes
that is what we were going for and don't
worry I haven't forgotten to get back to
the keyboard with you guys but I want to
see this Cinebench run and let's face it
this could take a little while so now's
a good time to get started on it all
right boom Cinebench r15 baby if we're
over do you remember what the surface
girl was good for was like around 400 or
so no idea thanks Jake you don't have
Google in front of you or anything so
you couldn't this is kind of like you
know how when they ask the producer on a
radio show like hey do you
the thing and they actually are looking
it up in the background alright look at
this he's see he may not be the fastest
kid on the street but darn it he gets
there he may not be the sharpest tool in
the shed but he's certainly a tool he
may not be the campus for Jake I'm just
I'm just trying to kill time well this
runs Oh we're not running on hold on
we're gonna run on wall power here I
don't know if that's gonna make a
difference all right hit me hit me a 160
- all right all right so that's a pretty
low bar anywhere from 120 to 160 - with
that said this is not some impressive
performance one thing we should have a
look at here though is what our CPU is
actually running at so this is nice
check this out
we're seeing speeds to the tune of
around 1.6 gigahertz turbo while we are
stressing all 4 cores and actually I can
use this opportunity to go through the
i/o with you guys so check this out
headphone microphone jack
all right nothing over here that looks
like a microphone though so bear that in
mind
over here microSD full-size USB type-a
move around to the back what why so we
got Gigabit LAN it says gigabit on the
spec sheet okay I'm gonna try it again
I'll try it again okay so they say
gigabit but we're gonna try that we've
got two more USB three Taipei's a USB
three types see that also a hat acts as
a power input HDMI oh yeah and this kit
is also compatible with hubs like this
so you could add full-size SD and all
this other crap to it with just one
connector I love USB type-c HDMI out and
it's been an rs-232 serial connector so
given the market that they're targeting
that actually makes a ton of sense
because I would if I was out in the
field and I wanted to connect to some
archaic piece of scientific equipment or
even a modern piece of scientific way
because a lot of it still uses a serial
interface I could totally do that with
this thing now mind you there are
usb-to-serial dongles so it's not like
you would have to buy one of these it's
just one of those sort of all in one
kind of creature comfort things that I
could I could definitely get behind so
the screen is six inches I don't think I
mentioned that before and this turbo
speed has managed to sustain itself here
so we're still running 1.6 gigahertz and
we can have a listen to how loud it is
so in terms of thermals they've got nice
big vents on the bottom they've got
exhaust on the back here can you hear it
on my mic Jake okay sorry well I wanted
to I want it to be representative of
like what it's like I mean it's not
super loud like yeah listen with it you
can turn the oh that's right so I've
seen this feature on their stuff before
I'm not gonna do it during the Cinebench
run but there's actually a switch on the
top here where we can turn the cooling
fan off and I suspect that would also
probably dial back the CPU Tamura like
that six watt limit and we'd probably
see around one gigahertz sustained
I'm guessing don't don't quote me on
that alright we're just about done here
the suspense I can hardly wait we ready
181 okay so in fairness that is better
than a surface go with that said the
surface go with its 10-inch screen and
just sort of general large earnest and
more sexy sex appeal Ness also has its
place but come we'll come on in let's do
some typing tests here okay
you know what Jake I'm gonna try to
touch type can you get okay so I'm
looking here I'm looking this way can
you uh can you dictate to me please oh
wait no no one well first you know
you'll dictate don't don't worry don't
worry you'll be the dictator I just I
wanted to I wanted to help put to this
instead oh oh right uh PIAA right this
video is brought to you by private
Internet access private Internet access
has thousands of servers in dozens of
countries all around the world it's a
great way to have a secure VPN
experience go check it out at the link
in the video description there's also
super affordable okay hey check this out
so I'm gonna touch tape dictate me it's
hard
hello and NT is just like like a slight
offset from my it got a little rougher
later okay okay oh hold on
I do like burritos
this is a this is a really long sentence
I got burrito it's hard to tell if I'm
hitting it oh wow that space bar is
horrendous okay come on come on in you
guys can have a can I have a closer look
at this so the the spacing of the
keyboard is not great because even
though to their credit they've actually
managed a fairly standard layout so the
enter key backspace
shift ish there's an up arrow there
that's sort of in the way are all kind
of where they're supposed to be but even
just to keep looking at this it's fine
I'll be right back but even if we
contrast it to their own previous mini
PC attempts the ability to like actually
put a finger on each one of the keys is
severely hampered so if you have a look
here like can you get a close-up shot
there to show how many keys my four
fingers are covering even all completely
close together can you see that you got
that cuz I've got I've got a 4 to 5
ratio here yeah how's that you like that
4 to 5 ratio here and bear in mind of
course to that while my fingers are a
little bit like thick sort of compared
to their length there my hands are
pretty small so you are not you're not
gonna have a better time so this is the
kind of device that you can pretty much
take for granted that you are not touch
typing on you're basically like you can
tell they kind of intend for it to be
used like like this that do that that
and then in an emergency if I oh man if
I need to enter some text I could be
like okay I'm filling out the
field report you know like that's kind
of the extent of the text entry you're
doing I think for a lot of people how do
I say this without coming across the
wrong way people who are old enough to
be my parents I think for a lot of
people this would actually be faster
than in putting on a smartphone but for
myself I can definitely type faster on a
touchscreen than I then I could on this
like there's no question with that said
your smartphone doesn't have the ability
to run Cinebench even if it's only a
hundred and twenty-one points so there's
a lot of things that you just flat-out
wouldn't be able to do without a full
you know x86 processor you know your
full web browser and even support for I
mean really anything so one of the
things that we queued up to do here is
actually let's fire up Ida and then yeah
look we're gonna fire up rocket leaves
heck yeah
not that that's gonna make me any better
at rocket League you know it's really
funny I often use playing on keyboard as
an excuse for sucking at rocket League
whenever we demo it or whenever I have
to like do it in b-roll or whatever else
and Jake's on to me because I think he
knows that I'm actually just terrible so
he provided me with an Xbox controller
to ensure that there's no excuse for me
now in fairness to me though I actually
do not know the controls on keyboard I
just also don't know them on controller
which is something that I had always
left off when we were having these kinds
of conversations so computer summary
what do we got here computer name no
what am i what am I looking for oh we
can get our temperatures and all that
kind of cool stuff how many people are
watching right now thanks guys
hope you guys are having as much fun as
we are by the way when shows not
cancelled today this stream what really
free recorded a hey like been apples
this yeah this this LAN shows not
canceled we wanted to do this stream
like four hours ago and then it got it
got delayed it got a little delayed
ah all right you know what I'm not gonna
bother like stress-testing let's just
hit it with rocket League and see what
happens so I'm gonna plug this in I love
the i/o though like it just has
everything
do they still not believe me look we
only pre record when we feel like it
okay so you know come on
actually we've only done it I think
probably like three times we were we've
pre recorded when show once was when we
were on vacation somewhere and then
another time was when like when show
fell on Christmas Day or something like
he just wasn't reasonable alright press
any button to start No
Oh wish me luck
is this not pairing have you paired this
you didn't pair this thank you for that
yeah I know how to do it it's just you
know if you do things ahead of time then
it makes for a smoother video especially
when it's a live stream Jake do you want
a chair to sit on David yeah that would
be a good idea I'll kneel yes did you
see that you missed it didn't you Oh
David behind the back catch and you
missed it that's a good throw Jake all
right press any button to start my god
that looks that looks awful
I think you did turn the settings way
down ah wait a minute why am I not
seeing the Settings thing also is
overscan on this looks horrendous
well I mean we don't even we still don't
even know if it's gonna like run decent
anyway so why don't we find out if we're
getting many many FPS and we can always
turn the details up oh boy that does not
look promising
Wow slow motion what's that yeah I'm
thinking maybe probably not oh man man I
suck at this game she said as though
there were games he doesn't suck at
where is it where's the ball oh there it
is
this is not an amazing experience
it's kind of where to go oh oh you know
what
conveniently though that means that I
can blame my terribleness on this bad
framerate oh crap I just want one goal
that's all I want is that so much to ask
no one knows what's going on right oh oh
I just hit it the wrong way wait where
is it oh my gosh terrible terrible aah
David are you judging me right now
thanks I appreciate that yeah oh yeah
I'm wearing my jeeva shirt today yes
it's more powerful than geebo anything's
more powerful than geebo so you know
what's interesting like I didn't think
720p was that bad and if you come in
here and look at this screen honestly
it's it's far more look at a bow I guess
that's just the beauty of pixel density
hey cuz if I get my face in really close
like yeah it looks like garbage but if I
was actually playing on the little
screen it wouldn't bother me nearly
nearly as much like there's not a lot of
detail there but it's still like it's
more usable actually does it seem to be
running smooth there David yeah now
that's interesting
has it kind of settled in a little bit
because even up here looks a little
better now no it does look smooth around
here that doesn't make any sense though
that's me weird unless the external
display is running at 30 Hertz it
doesn't seem to be no that's 60 for sure
and I'm gonna double check just to be
sure but I'm like very certain that this
is 60 Hertz yep weird okay
well honestly I mean is there much else
for us to say about this thing at this
point so unlike some of their other
devices this is not a mobile gaming
solution in any way shape or form the
keyboard is really only usable from like
a there we go from like hunting and
pecking with two thumbs kind of
perspective they definitely have some
work to do on the trackpad although like
with their track record I do have a
reasonable
of confidence that they're gonna figure
that out and the form factor is not
quite as slim and sexy as some of the
stuff that they've done before but I can
kind of understand it based on that they
intend this for a very different use
case really the selling point for this
guy is the i/o so if you need that video
output remember type-c can be converted
to anything including like VGA out if
you need serial and you need something
that's just kind of like throw in your
in your bag and and and let go and you
think there's a good chance you won't
need it but just in case you do it's
nice to have then I could kind of see
this thing's place as a device like that
now one thing I did promise that I was
gonna check before we finished here is
the land so Jake says he only got 100
megabit but they do advertise Gigabit
LAN so let's go ahead and see if that's
that's the thing it is really cool being
able to hook up like a full computers
worth of i/o to it though like that's
pretty sick alright let's go check this
out change adapter options come on it's
pretty slow gigabit yep I got a gigabit
I got gigabit oh cool so it must have
just been your connection or something
like that so in conclusion if you see
your specific need for this go ahead and
back it I personally wouldn't buy one
and this is brought to you by IP I a
speaking of things that I'd buy P I a
private Internet access is the VPN for
pretty much anyone it works on up to
five devices at once with a single
account they've got apps for Windows Mac
Linux Chrome I think there's like other
platforms coming at some point in the
future all the platforms they support
they have a Chrome extension did I say
that already
sorry okay yeah yeah yeah pretty much
everything they've got thousands of
servers they don't keep logs
they've got servers in dozens of
countries worldwide so where ever works
best for you in terms of performance or
in terms of features like if you wanted
to access oh I don't know you know BBC
video let's say for example then you'd
want to set your location to the UK and
you guys can check
at the link in the video description pa
is affordable and high-performance I
mean what else is there to really say
about it
back when we were switching our PIAA
endorsement we really shopped around in
P I a stood out to us as just having a
really long track record of not just
good performance and good customer
service but also just caring about the
privacy of their clients so go check
them out at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if you disliked this video you can hit
that button but if you liked it hit like
get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link below we probably
won't have that the IndieGoGo campaign
isn't even live yet but whatever also
down there is our merch store which s oh
whoops uh-oh cool shirts like this one
not late I don't think we have this one
the way well shirts like that one and
our community forum which you should
totally join this is that's totally an
LT t-shirt actually here el-tee you're
making it harder to see come on LT T
there you go Oh should I Oh should I
talk to some of the super chat peeps did
I ignore them your your thang I work at
Geek Squad where my co-workers and I
have your videos on 24/7
you guys are awesome epic Geek Squad
people can we get a web show ETA oh man
as soon as I can okay so here's the plan
we have one more video to do do you have
the EULA phone here or the EULA phone or
whatever okay so we're doing a video on
the phone power five we have to shoot
that today check this out this is gonna
be our live stream next week I think so
in screen fingerprint reader but bow up
give her a minute but bow oh I wonder
does the in screen fingerprint reader
work from that when you're on that no
okay let's try that a little more
gracefully BAM dang it why is it locking
stupid thing anyway whatever the point
is it has displays on both sides okay
it's that phone so I'm thinking we'll do
something with that next week we're just
we lost it in our warehouse for a couple
weeks so we're so late to it now that I
don't know if it justifies a full
dedicated video you guys can feel free
to let me know in the chat if you
disagree if you'd like to see it get the
full review treatment but it's the vivo
next dual screen or whatever they call
this thing but yeah so I got to go do

EULA phone thing and then I think that's
it and then one show right yeah heck
