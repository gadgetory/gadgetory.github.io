more now i've always said when people
ask me for a sound card recommendation
buy the cheapest asu's on our card that
you can afford or the most expensive one
you can afford whichever works best for
you buy an ASA sonar now the reason I
created the Linus tech tips forum was
because a lot of the time there's people
who know better than me especially when
it comes down to the nitty gritty
details of a given category and the
audio sub forum reached out to me and
said yo Linus we don't like that
recommendation because it's not always
necessarily true there are great options
out there and one of them happens to be
the file olympus e 10 USB amp and DAC
and what this is is it is a sound card
alternative so for those of you who
don't know what a DAC is it stands for
digital to analog converter and what it
does is it takes a digital signal which
your music is unless you're talking
about like you know records or cassette
tapes so it takes a digital signal and
turns it into an analog output that can
be interpreted by headphones or speakers
or other kinds of inherently analog
devices so it has a couple of advantages
versus a sound card that goes inside
your computer number one is it sits
outside your computer so you can use it
with the desktop you can use it with a
notebook you can use it with PC and Mac
it doesn't really doesn't really matter
it just plugs in via mini USB B so
there's that port right there which I
actually don't mind micro is the one I
hate there's been some confusion about
this lately so there you go just plugs
in by that and then plugs into a USB
port on the computer at manage number
two is because it is completely removed
from the internals of your PC there's no
real risk of electromagnetic
interference
now many internal sound cards have
things like shields on them but
obviously it's better to move away from
the EMI and put an aluminum shield over
the whole device anyway so without
further ado oh yeah right the next
advantages superb sound quality at a
very low cost so file is particularly
known for this they are extreme
upfront about exactly what components
you're getting inside
what kind of specs they're running in
fact you can go on the specifications on
their website they're kind of like Swift
tech this way where other waterblock
manufacturers are just like oh it has
the best flow it has this a site where
Swift Tech just takes all their blocks
and runs scientific comparisons and just
gives you the straight grass it's like
look this is how it performs exactly so
on their site you can check out things
like response curves and you can
actually see they're not just saying oh
well it has a you know flat frequency
response no they're actually telling you
exactly how much it has and then to go
along with the bass boost button which
is right here so there's actually a +3
decibel bass boost they actually show
you what the curve looks like once
you've enabled that as well and it looks
quite good so you're getting quite a lot
of bass up at the I guess I should
mirror it so you're getting quite a lot
of bass up here and then it comes down
and two more of that flat curve that you
saw before you enable bass boost now the
more steep that line is the more punchy
the bass will sound particularly at the
low end and the more gradual that line
is the more it's going to affect the mid
tones as well but of course because you
have this data you can make an educated
decision before you buy the product now
let's take a close look at the Olympus
itself so here on the front there's a
potentiometer which side there fancy way
of saying volume control that is what
happens to be inside of a volume control
unit but most most people won't
necessarily care too much about that
there's a volume it are not volume
indicator there's an a' power indicator
LED the bass boost button I talked about
before in all likelihood I would keep
that off however if you do like more
bass it is recommended to use bass boost
that's built into a high-quality amp and
DAC versus using something in software
because and I guess I'm about to go in a
bit of a rant here software eq's are not
the be-all and end-all I was talking
about I was talking on Twitter about the
audio output quality of the HTC one and
I was complaining about it and people
said oh we'll just get you know power
amp and you know set up your EQ no no no
no no I have power amp and I've set up
my EQ that doesn't change the fact that
the hardware inside the HTC One is not
as good as the iPhone 4 which is what I
was comparing it to there is no
substitute for better hardware so you
yes using hardware to adjust EQ settings
will be better than using soft
we're at least in this case and that's
what file has to say about and I tend to
agree with them on the back of the unit
we've got the USB in we've got a coaxial
oh now this is kind of a funny one to me
because coaxial is going to be carrying
a digital audio signal and it won't be
amplified so you've got a DAC an amp and
then you're going to send a non non
decoded non amplified anyway so the
purpose of it is if you wanted to run
something like an AV receiver which has
its own amp and DAC off of like your
MacBook which obviously doesn't have a
coax out then you could go USB into coax
out and then you could play your music
off there if you really wanted to do
something like that but whatever also on
the back there's a line out so you can
use that to plug into something like
powered speakers so it really does take
the place of a sound card in your system
and particularly for mobile users where
it's difficult to add a sound card or
for people who don't necessarily have
more expansion slots like if you run an
ITX machine or m ATX machine that's full
of graphics cards these can be a
fantastic option on the bottom there's
one thing that I had actually missed
there so there's a low or high gain
switch this is basically for headphones
that are are lower or higher impedance
so you want to turn the gain up if you
have high impedance headphones and the
e10 can handle up to 300 ohm headphones
and then you want to turn it down for
anything down to it's rated to around 16
ohm headphones so 16 to 300 ohms the
last thing that's included are eight
little rubber feet so you can actually
put those wherever you want it if you
wanted it to stand on you know this way
then you could do that or this way or
you could put all eight of them on same
time I don't know whatever the reason
they include eight is they include eight
of them and I guess what's left to wrap
up with is why this because file has a
ton of different products some of which
are just amps so they're meant to take a
source from something like an mp3 player
and just amplify it if you have higher
impedance headphones that are going to
not run very well directly off of your
iPhone or Android phone or whatever else
they have regular Dax that don't include
amps they have an mp3 player they have a
wide variety of products so the reason
that we are going to start with this one
is because it is a particular interest
to PC users it's only around 70 bucks we
means that if as long as it's outputting
pretty darn decent sound which to my
understanding it should haven't tried it
yet but a will that makes it very
competitive with other sound card
options that are available thank you for
