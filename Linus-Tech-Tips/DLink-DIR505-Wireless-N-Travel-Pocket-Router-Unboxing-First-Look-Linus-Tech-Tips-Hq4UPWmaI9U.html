I'm actually surprisingly excited about
this is the d-link dir-505 it's an
all-in-one mobile companion which I
think they need to say as mini router
great for traveling and it sure is
transformed to any internet connection
into a Wi-Fi hotspot so you know what
let's let's start by getting it opened
up but this thing is extremely cool so
it's the size of like I don't know the
size of a wall wart basically and it
will provide you with check this up so
it turns your your LAN connection into a
hotspot that you can connect up to 50
devices - it also has a bunch of other
cool features so let's start with oh
okay let's start with the sexy ribbon
cable Ethernet cable that comes with it
very very nice love to see that you can
bundle that up nice and small and pack
it with you wherever you go
you've also got links to the mobile apps
and the mobile apps that's included is
like just killer actually so here we got
this we got this
we got a little card that community
tells you all the default information
about it which will be handy because
you'll be sort of moving around with it
and you won't necessarily have your
instruction manual handy that we don't
need so let's have a look at what d-link
has to say for themselves and why I'm
all like stoked on this router at this
point so features multiple operation
modes so it can either be a router slash
access point or it can be a repeater or
it can be a repeater or a Wi-Fi network
extender very cool 802.11 n so yes it's
wireless n don't electric switch really
no way check that out it has a hard ware
switch to change it from router /ap mode
to Wi-Fi hotspot where it's not acting
as a router such as if you're in a hotel
to repeater mode where if you're using
this at home and you're just like you
know gonna plug it in discreetly sorry
about that so you can discreetly plug
them in if you're gonna use it as a
wireless network extender you've got
your WPS button
well as your hard reset button like it
has all the functionality that like oh
no there's your hardware hard reset okay
I don't know what this is oh it's an
indicator LED derp okay um doesn't come
apart in any way so oh yeah there look
it's got your default information right
on there as well that's very cool so you
just have to take it out of the wall I
have a look at it if you don't happen to
have that card I need stop moving right
along supports charging smart phones
over USB how cool is that
so this USB port here can be used to
charge something USB well it's you know
conveniently plugged in or you can even
use it as a share port with the included
app which is available either on the App
Store or on Google Play so cool so you
plug you throw a USB key on there and
then using the supported using the app
you just beam it to yourself over your
wireless network very cool
okay so moving right along Wi-Fi
Protected setup yeah yeah dual active
firewalls
yeah I'm not only in router mode ok the
sharePort AHA in router and Wi-Fi
hotspot mode only which makes sense
because otherwise how would it how would
it even gain any access to the network
at all sharePort mobile app for iPhone
and iPad
ok router in my phone did you do okay
it's a web file access wall plug design
from her convenient use elegant sign
compact size did not block other outlets
weren't at JP configuration guests on
support 24/7 basic installation support
and a one-year warranty so basically
this is the kind of thing where if you
can't figure out the practical
applications of it then you probably
don't need one and if you can then
you're probably just as excited about
this as I am
travel routers are very popular because
if you do travel a lot the single
Ethernet port in your stupid hotel room
is often not enough if you have visitors
or if you have multiple devices like you
have your laptop and you have a tablet
for example which is pretty common these
days so this solves that problem and it
does it in a very compelling form factor
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and I hope you enjoyed
this one hey fella is that a router in
your pocket or are you just happy to see
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
