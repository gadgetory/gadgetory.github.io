here to CES 2016 also check out the link
in the description down below first up
at MSI we've got the x99 a godlike
gaming carbon now you might have seen
the xa9
a godlike before but it had kind of red
acts since then but was an RGB board
which is a little bit conflicting so if
you wanted anything other than red it
might look a little bit weird so now
they went with the carbon idea there's a
lot more black they've got aluminum
armor shroud they've got carbon fiber
wrapping kind of things on a few of the
heat sinks and whatnot so it's more of a
neutral black that's gonna look good
with basically any color you decide to
have on those RG B's which are still
included which is pretty sick also they
have steel armor on the like PCI Express
slots and the memory they're saying that
this is for weight I don't know if
you're really gonna have a huge benefit
from that for the memory but it looks
really cool regardless and it's kind of
a neat feature I guess next is another
motherboard refresh this is a Zed 170 a
gaming Pro carbon and there isn't a ton
that's changed here we still we see the
same steel reinforcement on the PCI
Express slots that we did on the godlike
we see the same style of carbon fiber
covering also not quite as cool but the
same style in terms of carbon fiber
covering that we saw on the godlike and
then there's one more actually fairly
major feature improvement over the
previous at 178 gaming Pro which is the
USB type-c USB 3.1 connector which is on
the back io plate which is definitely a
solid improvement and last but maybe not
least depending on your aesthetic
choices is the B 150m gaming 3x it's a
relatively low end gaming board but I'm
trying to convince them to make like a
blinged-out ballin board with it because
I want to see like crazy gold-plated
heat sinks and stuff and I would love
for them to challenge us to do a build
that's like awesome and china themed
that is like gold plated with red
accents all over the place and stuff I
think that would be sick so like hit
them up on Twitter hit Nick up on
Twitter hit me up on hit or hit hit
Dennis up on Twitter I don't even really
care or set up a website from
Squarespace where you can like manage
contact forms there that would be nice
as well you can make a website about
gold plating computers you
one of the templates and it would look
really cool if you had problems setting
it up the 24/7 live chat and email
support which is like I don't know I
think that's pretty solid I think that's
cool also if you buy a domain for a year
cuz obviously your gold plating computer
business is gonna be super successful
you get a domain for free which is
included also very nice anyways
Squarespace build it beautiful thank you
