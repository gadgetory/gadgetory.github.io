socket fm1 motherboard unboxing this is
the asou f1 a 75 M Pro it uses the AMD a
75 chipset as I mentioned before fm1
socket this is a brand new socket this
is for special chips because I can't
even call them CPUs anymore that are
called APU so they have a CPU component
a graphics component and that is a
DirectX 11 ready graphics component so
let's dive right into this so we've got
eight vision or e2 vision I'm actually
not familiar with that what that means
but the chip that I'll be trying this
with is actually an eight CPU GPU APU
it's an APU so that is what I will be
having in terms of my experience this a
vision level okay we have digi+ vrm
that's nice to see on a micro ATX port
UEFI BIOS also great to see there TPU
and EPU processors for performance and
energy savings respectively USB 3 is
featured on this chipset and let's have
a look at the backs of the digi+ vrm
they're showing you that lower
interference is better I should
certainly think so
and giving us a little bit more
information about those features so the
epu is all about detecting your current
PCE loadings and automatically adjusting
the energy savings TPU is for turbo
they've got their auto system level up
auto tuning that's available in the BIOS
as well and the UEFI BIOS allows you to
use a mouse their view EFI BIOS node is
actually outstanding so I would
definitely recommend using it if you
have this board not that you'll have a
choice you will have to use it ok this
is a slightly different packaging layout
than I've seen on a seuss motherboards
before so let's take the board up a
little bit here and let's have a look at
what they've done with their accessories
oK we've got to say 2 3 6 gigabit per
second cables yes
sata3 six gigabit per second native
motherboards so the chipset supports it
you don't need any third-party chips and
that is six ports so they're both
straight to right-angled cables we have
a user's guide which includes a driver
DVD as well as a powered by a Seuss
sticker download the latest drivers off
the soos or AMD website next we have an
i/o shield which is helpfully labeled in
terms of what's what now let's have a
look at the board itself okay this is
gonna be a good unboxing because it's
the first one of a brand new platform
I'm always excited about that kind of
stuff so why don't we start right here
this is the socket fm1 now it looks
similar to socket am3 but it's not quite
the same first of all I want you guys to
notice these blocked off pins right here
can you see those okay so those blocked
off pins right there right away you know
socket fm1 if you can't read so you're
not going to even be able to physically
fit older m2 or am-3 processors into the
socket now I also want to show you guys
how to tell which way to orient your CPU
there's a little triangle right there
you're gonna match that up with a little
gold triangle on the bottom of your chip
that's the way to put it in you lift up
your lever you put the CPU and you lock
it down that's how it works it works
with a four a six and eight ap use and
you will have full support for onboard
graphics remember one of their
competitors had kind of a silly platform
before where it's depending on which CPU
you plugged in you did or didn't have
access to the onboard graphics it will
all work no problem okay we've got our
eight pin power and it's ideal location
up at the top left corner of the board
we have a CPU PWM fan header right there
we have support for dual channel ddr3
memory up to four slots just like that
we have our EP you and TPU switches
right here we've also got a memo case
which so what that means is no matter
what memory you're running in here you
can press the memo K button to boot it
up and the memory will run at a safe
setting so you can get into the BIOS and
make any adjustments to the timings and
speed our 24 pin connectors in this
ideal location along the right-hand edge
we've got another PWM chassis fan
controller we've got our chipset here
which is excellent to see it's got a
little tiny heatsink on it
so it's clearly not doing much most of
the most of the cool stuff is happening
up here in the APU we've got six SATA
three six gigabit per second ports those
are native those are off the AMD chipset
awesome love to see that here's our
front panel headers so that's for your
power switch your LEDs your all that
good stuff we have a USB 3 internal
header that also oh that's terrific
this board has six USB 3 ports on a
micro ATX port outstanding we've got 4
USB 2 headers because all that support
is still built into the chipset so I
guess this is figured well we'll just
throw the Hatters on there they can plug
in as much USB as they please
ok we've got our front panel audio and
in terms of the slot level look at that
another 4 pin PWM fan this is actually a
pretty high-end motherboard especially
considering the form factor as well as a
3 pin fan connector so we got 4 PW our
three PWM and one 3 pin fan controller
alright let's have a look at what we got
in terms of slots so we've got a PCIe
16x slot PCIe 1x slot a PCI slot and
then a PCIe physical 16x lot but you can
actually see in here the wiris it's only
wired for 8x so if you were to run
crossfire X which means to discrete
graphics then you would be running it at
8 X 8 X okay let's see what AMD says
about our AMD as sue says about this
board you've got dual graphics DirectX
11 support what's dual graphics well
dual graphics means to take your APU you
put it there you take your GPU you put
it there and they will actually work
together kind of like a hybrid crossfire
used to do except it actually seems to
work quite well this time around so
that's a pretty cool feature um I guess
I'm not really saying too much about it
oh yeah this is cool check this out
so this bracket here looks kind of
different from what we've seen before an
AMD motherboard guess what still
compatible with your old AMD compatible
heatsink so you've got the same mounting
holes you've got the same clips right
here so you shouldn't run into any
problems as far as using your older
solutions so you don't have to waste
money upgrading stuff that still works
just fine we've got 4 USB 3 ports on the
back one of those ps2 mouse keyboard
combo ports optical audio out HDMI VGA
NDVI of note is the fact that the DVI
port supports up to 2560 by 1600 dual
link very cool haven't seen that on
onboard graphics yet two USB 2 ports an
Ethernet port Gigabit Ethernet of course
and 7.1 audio out thank you for checking
