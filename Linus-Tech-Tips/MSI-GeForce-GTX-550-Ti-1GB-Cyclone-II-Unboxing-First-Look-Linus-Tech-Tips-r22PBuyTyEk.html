of interesting things so this is the msi
gtx 550 ti or ty which is a one gig
brand new video card brand new GPU from
nvidia and it also marks the
introduction of the cyclone - so the
cyclone cooler was incredibly popular
still is incredibly popular on the lat
previous generation cards from msi but
it looks like they've made some
improvements to it and they've made
enough improvements to call it an
upgraded cyclone - so let's find out
what's up with the cyclone - once we get
things opened up first of all this is an
OC edition card so that means it is
factory overclocked it is ready for 3d
mark 11 which is one way of saying it is
a DirectX 11 card it's compatible with
MSI Afterburner which is awesome its
overclocking utility monitoring temps
all that good stuff
it supports CUDA SLI physics 3d vision
as well as invidious around if you run
two of them together it uses MSI's
military class concept including solid
state chokes and solid caps for no coil
line and up to 10 years lifetime we've
also got a three year warranty in the
USA and Canada oh and here's one
interesting difference between the
cyclone and the cyclone - the propeller
blade now allows for up to 20% more
airflow interesting yes okay what do we
got in here okay more of the same stuff
right oh you're some specs on the
cyclone - here we go
so 9 centimeter pwm fan up to 40% more
airflow to cool down the GPU memory and
power modules all at once multiple heat
pipes so it has it looks like 2 heat
pipes through the window there though
it's hard to say yet hybrid heatsink
design so it combines aluminum extrusion
heat pipes and fins for maximum cooling
nickel plated copper base rounded design
okay well prevents dust accumulation
okay none of that ultimate low noise yes
that I knew the cyclones of the original
cyclone was a very very low noise cooler
and propeller blade so that provides up
to 20 percent more airflow versus a
traditional designs based on the same
thermal mode with the same rpm
interesting okay so
go ahead and get this box opened up
don't see anything particularly
fascinating on the back see it's a PCI
Express 16x card it requires a minimum
400 water greater system power supply
with a minimum 12 volt current reading
of 24 amps and everything else on there
is fairly irrelevant yeah all right this
is an interesting way of packing the
cart I don't know if this is a retail
card just so you guys know so I'm not
quite sure if the retail cards will come
like this this is a tech tips card but
there you go
it is phat well you know what look okay
let's not fault them for their methods
let's let's evaluate based on what was
the objective and did they achieve it
the objective was keep the card in place
and protect it during shipping and they
did achieve it however in elegantly
alright look at the accessories we've
got a 2 molex to single 6 pin PCIe power
adapter we've got one of them little
mini HDMI 2 full-sized HDMI adapters
that could be useful as very few TVs
have a native mini HDMI cable we've got
a DVI to VGA adapter which by the way I
know I'm always knocking the DVI to VGA
adapter but for this particular card
very appropriate because you may have an
older VGA monitor that you would want to
run off this card because it's low res
and this card is going to be optimized
for 1680 by 1050 or below that's the
kind of price point that this card
exists in so let's see if we've got
anything else down here yes we do msi
hides their driver CD since they know
that you should probably not use it you
should throw it away and download the
latest off the nvidia website and we've
also got a little guy for something ok
and then a quick user's guide which
basically shows you how to install a
PCIe card but if you watch Linus tech
tips then you probably already know that
because I have
that in the past alright so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to flip
this over and that'll make a nice little
platform for my card and let's get the
560 Ti or tie on to platform so we can
check it out alright so the first thing
the most noticeable thing about this
about this new cyclone tube cooler to me
is that they've added like a little like
blade style shroud II thing on it so
each one of these actually kind of looks
like the like the blade of a curved
sword or something like that and I think
that's the effect they're going for
because they got like these little these
little shaggy things here right there
which would be pretty nasty if you were
cutting someone open with them so that's
a very aggressive look to the cooler
itself the overall design of it looks
fairly similar to the original cyclone
and in that it has the the normal flower
heat sink here it's got the heat pipes
and then those heat pipes are used to
carry heat out to this nice dense fin
array so what that means is we're not
wasting any of the cooling capacity of
this fan so the any air that's blown
downward is going to be cooling the GPU
through the aluminum fins here and any
air that is blown out to the side is
going to be cooling the GPU because the
heat pipes are going to be carrying the
heat up to these fins and then it can
carry the heat out this way out this way
and in every which way
ms:i over the reference design has also
added a couple other things they've
actually got a heat sink here on the
voltage regulators and you're gonna see
that that's going to get a ton of air
flow from this fan when it spins
it'll just be blowing over those heat
sinks I don't think we'll have to worry
about those running warm at all and
they've also added a little stiffening
plate so this is interesting you can see
right here little NSI branded plate and
it looks like what that's for is just to
hold the PCB rigid when you've got it
installed in your case because it's not
really connected to anything else and
that's something that I've really felt
should be included with more graphics
cards sorry especially as they start to
get heavier and heavier
all right let's start taking off these
little protective covers EBI poor it's
off the SLI connector off the mini HDMI
there we go okay so another thing I
wanted to point out about this car right
here is that you can see that some of
the pins on the PCI Express connector
appear to be missing this is by design
this is not a defect in your card these
are unnecessary for performance and
bandwidth and NVIDIA has deemed them to
be perfectly fine to remove the card is
still PCI Express compliant so you don't
have to worry about any motherboard
compatibility issues or anything like
that
the cyclone 2 fan is actually a 4 pin
pwm controlled fan and I don't know what
the noise characteristics of it are like
but if it's anything like the old one
it's probably a pretty pretty decent
here we've got a 6 pin PCI Express power
connector that's all we're going to need
as far as external power goes for the
gtx 550 PI or ti on the back of the card
we actually see one of the cooler
innovations that nvidia has brought
about with the gtx 550 ti they've
actually given their board partners the
capability of mixing and matching
different capacities of memory on the
card so i'm not sure which ones are
which but my guess would be that these
four are all totalling up to 512 megs
and these two together are 512 Meg's to
give us our one gig capacity because the
550 ty has a 192 bit memory interface
which is significantly more than any
other previous generation card in this
price bracket but it only has 6 memory
modules so how does it have a one gig
capacity which would imply that it would
have to have either 4 or 8 memory
modules well it's because they're mixing
and matching the capacities to give us
that extra bandwidth but also that extra
that nice round even capacity so that's
a pretty neat thing that Nvidia has
brought about on this generation of
cards here at the back we find something
we're pretty used to seeing on MSI cards
and NVIDIA cards in general we've got
two DVI ports one HTM 1 mini HDMI port
and these only 2 of these 3 can be used
at any given time if you do run to 550
ty
you can run three monitors off of the
two cards together but for an individual
card yeah they're using DVI DVI DVI mini
HDMI or DVI mini HDMI we've also got our
typical MSI branded exhaust port here
although with cyclone cooler not a whole
lot of the exhaust is going to be going
to the outside of the case anyhow
due to the design of the cooler the 550
is a fairly low power consumption low
he--oh heat output card though so I
wouldn't worry too much about the
overall case temperatures being affected
by having the exhaust going out into
your case the SLI connector is up here
and as you can see there's only one of
them so that's going to support two-way
SLI but not 3-way or four-way SLI I mean
really honestly those features would be
pretty unnecessary on a card at this
price point anyway so thank you for
