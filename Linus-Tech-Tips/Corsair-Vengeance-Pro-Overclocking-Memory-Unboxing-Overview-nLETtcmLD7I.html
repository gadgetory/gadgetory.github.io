if you're a speed freak added until 3500

truly enthusiast class experience
welcome to my unboxing and first look at
the Corsair Vengeance Pro z87 optimized
overclocking memory series so what is
what is vengeance Pro because courser
has so many lines of memory now they've
got dominators and vengeance a--'s and
they've got you know their regular stuff
and low profile and high profile and
like you know it seems like they have a
memory for anyone well this one is
targeted at someone a little bit
different from anything else so unlike
something like Dominator Platinum's
which you know are available as high
performance kits and all of that noise
but they've got light bars and they've
got sort of frills and gimmicks that the
hardcore overclocking crowd looked at
and kind of went well we don't
necessarily need that stuff
what we want is overclockable modules
that we can achieve high frequencies
with we can pull the spreaders off and
use more exotic cooling we want
something that's more of a bare-bones
module so that's where vengeance Pro
comes in going to go ahead and open this
up it's available in four different
colors silver blue red as well as gold
to match the latest Asus z87 boards it's
available in a very high speed grades in
fact courser was showing off 3200
megahertz or 3.2 gigahertz when we were
at Computex this year and they are built
with black PCB so they'll look good even
without you know having lighting effects
on personally I love Dominator
Platinum's but even without having
lighting effects on them or anything
like that and they will match your
system so here we go so we can look we I
don't I don't have a silver motherboard
unfortunately but you can see what the
silver module will look like in a gold
themed board so of course you are
supposed to get a gold module for this
but you know I don't always do things
100% right on these videos there are
fairly simple looking memory sticks like
I said black PCB just a simple vengeance
branding on the side of them as well as
the Vengeance style heat spreader here
and then just a Corsair Vengeance logo
on the top of them
jool itself so that is pretty much what
they look like installed in your system
and I think that pretty much wraps this
one up thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the Corsair
Vengeance pro series again optimized for
LGA 1150 but that isn't to say that it
won't work just fine on LGA 1155 don't
forget to subscribe - tech tips for
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and let me know if you think this
two-tone color scheme kind of works with
the gold and silver or if I should have
asked Corsair for a gold memory kit to
put in the gold asus motherboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
