new full desktop grade 980 in a laptop
it's pretty insane and if you haven't
seen our quick on-the-spot coverage of
it click up here because it's pretty
great the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster
gives you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
click now to learn more while we were
there we also got to check out some
pretty great looking laptops and when
you pair in vidiians design philosophy
for this product of more cooling and not
only an unlocked GPU but an unlocked CPU
as well with the hopes of these our
overclocking both of them that leads to
some really tasty sounding laptops I'll
start with the clever some of you may be
wondering what clever is exactly well if
you haven't heard of them that doesn't
mean you haven't used their laptops
clever is an O DM or an original design
manufacturer meaning that you will find
their designs under many other brands
who will make either minor tweaks or
even just rebadge them and sell them as
their own
their main offering here is the p8 7-0
DM this laptop comes equipped with the
GTX 980 is you probably expect and a
desktop grade 6700 K along with 16
gigabytes of RAM and a 1080p g-sync
display all running Windows 10 so
basically a desktop in your backpack on
the left-hand side you have a Gigabit
Ethernet jack
2 USB 3.0 ports a USB C Thunderbolt port
an SD MMC slot and a USB 3 slash eSATA
combo port on the back there are two
full-size display ports a power jack and
an HDMI port on the right hand side you
have a slot for a lock for 3.5
millimeter audio jacks and one USB 3.0
connector and lastly on top you have a
very nicely backlit keyboard and a
fingerprint reader for stuff like
logging in and encryption next up we
have the Auris x7 which is considerably
thinner than the previously mentioned
too clever for easier transportation
experiences comes with the same gtx 980
graphics card but with a core i7 5700 HQ
this time around
also with 16 gigabytes of ram a 1080p
screen and gsync technology built in all
running oddly
enough windows 8.1 although you should
be able to pretty easily upgrade on the
left-hand side of this guy you've got
two USB 3.0 ports one HDMI port one mini
display port and an SD card reader on
the back there's also a USB 2.0
connector and a power connector with
right-hand side having two 3.0 ports one
HDMI connector one mini display port and
an SD card reader and last but not least
we have the msi gt72 this guy's closer
in thickness to the clever than the
Auris it's still rocking the GTX 980
which is like kind of the whole point so
not too surprising a core i7 6820 HK 16
gigabytes of RAM and a 1080p g-sync
panel all running Windows 10 on the
left-hand side of this one there's four
USB 3.0 ports for 3.5 millimeter audio
jacks and an SD card slot it also has a
party in the back with power Ethernet
HDMI mini DisplayPort USB type-c
Thunderbolt and a security connector all
kind of hiding back there behind the
screen on the right it has an optical
drive which is actually pretty
surprising these days and two more USB
3.0 connectors the top also features a
backlit keyboard and a bunch of settings
buttons along with the power button over
kinda on the left hand side
considering the sheer amount of raw
power in these laptops I'm pretty
excited to see what kind of splash they
make on the market I ended up playing
eval curry on the cliff oh and honestly
the experience was smoother than a
number of demonstration pcs that I've
tried it on that may speak more to the
lack of performance for the
demonstration PC than anything but still
these laptops are packing some power
just before the end here I'm going to
throw up some performance graphs but if
you actually do want to see the proper
performance of these laptops
I recommend again checking out the
previous video over here or we actually
check out the technology behind the GTX
980 naught M that's in the laptop
