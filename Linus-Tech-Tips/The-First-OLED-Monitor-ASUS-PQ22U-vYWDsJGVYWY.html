comparisons to help us assess just how
next-gen the Asus PQ 22 you OLED monitor
is would be to take it and put it right
beside another conventional high-end a
sous display the PQ 27 UQ and the first
thing you guys will notice especially if
you're one of those dark mode all the
things types is how much deeper and
richer the blacks are this shouldn't
really come as a surprise though since
it's the main claim to fame of OLED you
get much higher contrast because when
the pixels are ordered to display black
they really give you black rather than
that glowy dark gray that you're used to
on an LCD but surely then there's got to
be a downside right yeah there is so
let's talk about that after I talk about
today's sponsor I fix it the Marlin
screwdriver set from I fix it features
five specialty precision screwdrivers
check it out today at ifixit.com forward
slash Linus
in a nutshell the reason that LCDs can't
display true black is that they work by
shining a backlight through a membrane
of liquid crystals that twist or untwist
to let the appropriate amount of light
through but displaying black doesn't
make the backlight turn off it just
makes the liquid crystals reorganize to
try and block the light as you can see
sunlight always makes it through either
the crystal membrane or through the
cracks between the pixels OLED
technology by contrast uses no backlight
instead applying electricity causes
special organic phosphorous to glow so
if you want black or the absence of
light you just turn off the electricity
and the results are I mean they're just
incredible I'm a huge fan of OLED
technology and the 3840 by 2160
resolution and inky blacks on this
display make it just look so visceral
much like the OLED screens that high-end
phone buyers have been appreciating for
the last few years also of note and this
is actually one of the things that I've
been personally most excited about with
this technology is this displays
incredible 0.1 millisecond pixel
response time now this demo here will be
a familiar one for display nerds and
this is cool
even through the camera if you get close
you can really see the way that an OLED
display can cut down on motion blur by
the extra detail that you can make out
on the aliens ship and face freaking
awesome and speaking of getting close
you shall at just 21 and a half inches
this is about as small as modern
monitors get so I guess it was a smart
move for Asus to market this thing as a
portable display for creators on the go
you see the stand here is actually only
held on by magnets and the monitor can
be easily folded and slipped into a bag
leaving you with a display that feels
like when you're holding it kind of like
an oversized tablet it's only one and a
half kilograms an eight and a half
millimeters thick it also comes with
this
Natick screen protector / stand that
enables multiple configurations
including a vertical mount but honestly
it was a little hard to set up and too
unstable to really inspire confidence so
if I were you I'd probably stick with
the metal stand which does still offer
about twenty degrees of tilt adjustment
oh and one more thing I'm sure many of
you will appreciate the included stylish
leather carry bag although for me mainly
served as a reminder that 21 and a half
inches is too small for my main
workstation but too big for me to just
slip it into my backpack and actually
the portable design also effects it in
other ways like the ports all we get is
a single micro HDMI and two USB C ports
which carry both DisplayPort and power
I'll get back to those in a bit though
because right now I have some burning
questions to answer about the elephant
in the room image retention commonly
called burnin image retention is one of
the two main reasons why o LED monitors
haven't already become mainstream with
the other one being their overall
shorter lifespan basically burnin is
caused by pixels displaying the same
thing for long periods of time so news
station logos sports scoreboards video
game HUDs I mean really anything that
stays on the screen without changing or
moving it was the bane of plasma TVs and
it's the worst nightmare of any Ola
donor I mean I personally go to great
lengths to ensure that my OLED TV never
gets used for long gaming sessions or
streaming music for example the issue is
that on a PC there are a lot of things
that always stay in the same spot like
TAS bars buttons and toolbars and
there's no real way to avoid them
altogether so how then does the PQ 22
you overcome these challenges has there
been a technological advancement that's
allowed us to finally have OLED monitors
without worrying about burnin No
no the PQ 22 you actually uses
fundamentally the same countermeasures
that OLED TVs have been using for years
like shifting the whole image over by a
few pixels when it detects static
content or simply dimming the screen
which this one does with the help of a
human sensor right over there
now that is supposed to detect whether
the monitor is actively being used by
looking for someone sitting in front of
it but honestly I ended up turning it
off completely because I guess it was
registering me as a lizard person or
something and turning the screen off
when I was in the middle of doing
something extremely annoying with all of
that said even if they didn't help with
burnin technological advancements did
still play a role in bringing this
monitor to market so the PQ 20 to you
uses an OLED panel made by a relatively
new company Joe led a joint venture
between Sony Panasonic and Japan Display
established in 2014 and while their OLED
panels use full RGB sub pixels like the
AMOLED screens made by Samsung Joe LED
is using an inkjet printing
manufacturing process to make their
panels thirty to fifty percent cheaper
than those produced with the
conventional evaporation method so then
that's pretty great affordability at
last and I mean big-screen OLED TVs are
popular handheld devices with OLED
screens are popular why not then go
after the market in the middle well this
is where we get into the problems for
one thing 21 and a half inches is what I
refer to as a tweener size it's too big
for tablets and laptops but smaller than
the 23 to 24 inch size that has become
really entry-level for the desktop and
then for two if they're inkjet process
has contributed to making this thing a
lot cheaper I don't even want to know
how much it was gonna cost if they made
it the conventional way because a seuss
is charging 4000 for this thing and and
no not ring it or yen in rupees I'm
talking four thousand freedom dollars so
to put that in perspective at that price
I
could buy a 55 inch LGB 8 4k OLED TV
burn it into oblivion and then buy a new
one who so okay but like hold on a
second men I mean lots of products are
expensive that doesn't necessarily mean
that they're a terrible value so let's
imagine for a moment let's play a little
game money's no object and then while
we're at it you you love the the total
21 and a half inch size if those things
are true are you getting the premium
performance that the price tag implies
okay so this is marketing this display
towards creators and they include a
factory calibration report boasting of
it's fantastic color accuracy thanks and
indeed it has great coverage of the srgb
Adobe RGB and DCI p3 color spaces which
is great the problem is that when it
comes to actually reproducing these
billions of colors it fails and I mean
like really fails like harder than the
cheapest Walmart monitor that we checked
out recently but how can that be
possible so here's what we discovered we
could get much improved color accuracy
and act like really accurate if we
measured just a small part of the screen
rather than the entire thing we're
talking Delta ease under 1 that's
basically perfect the problem is that we
can't get this kind of performance
across the entire screen and it's
because the screen just isn't bright
enough suggesting that there's a power
issue when it just isn't getting enough
juice through its USB type-c port so in
srgb mode the brightest white is under
18 it's and they lock the brightness so
you can't even turn it up like you can
in their best buy showroom standard mode
which makes me wonder then about the HDR
experience now this monitor supports HDR
10h LG
and dolby vision it's actually one of
the world's first displays to do so it's
just that it only has a peak brightness
of 335 nits and a sustained brightness
of a hundred and fourteen it's now that
is a far cry from the brightness levels
that are required for good
HD our thing is it's an inherent
characteristic of OLED technology that
increased brightness means increased
risk of burnin so bottom line then
should you buy this monitor remember
we're playing a little game you like the
portability and money is no object
honestly the answer is still no the
price would be absurd even if the
product wasn't as rough around the edges
as this one is and the portability even
though we're playing this game where you
like it just feels like kind of a
tacked-on gimmick to make up for the
fact that the screen is too small
making matters worse it doesn't even
have its own internal battery like other
cheaper portable monitors with all of
that said though as a tech demo for the
concept of OLED monitors in general I'm
still excited but also kind of getting
worried about whether this is ever going
to take off I mean the price is gonna
have to drop by a factor of four or five
which is possible over time but it's
really clear to me that manufacturing
volume has to ramp up significantly to
make that happen and the risk then is
that by the time that happens OLED could
be replaced by emerging technologies
like micro LED which if all goes
according to plan is going to have all
the benefits of OLED so those fast
response times and perfect blacks but
with none of the drawbacks and that is
the degradation that comes from using
organic substances do you need to create
