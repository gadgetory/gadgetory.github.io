that while Mack Mack oh we're off to a
good start while Apple can refuse to
service us they can't very well refuse
to sell us stuff and we tested that
theory on the brand new MacBook Pro 15
inch 2018 Edition 32 gigs of ram 512 GB
SSD 2.9 gigahertz 15.4 inch Radeon Pro
560 X Core I 9 laptop now you guys have
probably seen the headlines about this
thing headline number one they fixed the
keyboard maybe question mark no one
seems to be 100% sure about that as of
the last time that I was looking at
anything and headline number two oh wait
I shouldn't open it yet hold on headline
number two is that this thing thermal
throttle I cam other-- advertiser
friendly content so we figured since it
actually just arrived like two hours ago
because Canada we get to be way behind
all the American media outlets we
figured let's set ourselves a challenge
let's set a timer take can you set a
timer let's set a timer and find out
exactly how long it will take us to go
from completely sealed box to thermal
throttled processor so yeah let's let's
let's hit this thing okay let me get a
knife ready let me get a knife ready
actually I'm gonna use Maxine's Fork i
hardcore stole that hardcore stole Max's
Fork all right do it rip this baby open
ah okay garbage goes over there the new
2018 MacBook Pro just like the old
MacBook Pro but a better processor but
maybe you're not getting the benefit of
it alright so we've got our USB type-c
cable I mean I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
skimp on the unboxing experience that
you would normally get here on - tech
tip so I want you guys to come along
with me on the epic journey of discovery
of these documentation this warranty
information thanks for that Apple and
these Apple stickers that you can put on
all of your favorite things look at this
now we have a red
with an apple sticker oh I'm doing it
I'm doing it Brandon
I just put that I just put the Apple
sticker right over the red logo and
don't take that off if you take that off
then I mean I'm not gonna fire you
because you're a very valuable employee
but I could I I could I could say mean
things to you I'll say mean things in
fact I'll say them to I'll say them to
I'll say them to your girlfriend
yeah I'll say mean things about you to
her there all right she knows me
reasonably well yes she knows me
reasonably well like we went on a date
once so like she probably wouldn't
believe what I said no wait we did we
did no I'm not joking at all no Brandon
couldn't make it because he was
literally busy doing camera operation
for the show that we went to see and
he's like hey I've got a ticket oh by
the way you're going with my girlfriend
no I'm not joking at all look I'm on
this okay I got my power adapter plugged
in because Apple makes magical products
you can plug this power adapter into any
one of the four ports on actually okay
not any one of the five ports but any
one of the four Thunderbolt 3 ports on
this particular device you've got that
three and a half millimeter jack hmm
yeah I'd love to see that and then two
thunderbolt 3s over here to Thunderbolt
3s over there and a whole lot of not a
heck of a lot else you got
space is a Space Gray there's are
different grades a space great I don't
know I've never I've never been to space
unlike apples color engineers I mean
they must have color engineers can you
imagine that as a job title I'm its
color engineer I mean companies like
Pantone must have like lots of color
engineers look at that look how fast
that booted up see I'm not behind at all
oh it's talking to me hi Siri um all
right so we're gonna go ahead and select
our English language we're not gonna be
throttling this okay some people are not
super chatting right we got this one guy
BJ who goes Linus long time lurker your
integrity is golden don't ban me come
visit and tour one of our do
Realty mega datacenters okay so that's a
$20 super chat then like a minute later
there's a $40 super chat for wait how
does this work why does it keep sending
money and then right after that there's
a $50 super chat for am I doing this
wrong yeah that's that's the last thing
will they actually came through after
the street ended so that's why it's
showing up in today's I'm going I hope
this is just an elaborate troll BJ
because know you're not doing it right
you're doing it super wrong I'm not even
life right now I think we've got out Wow
we've got a whole bunch of them rolling
in today though hi Antonio says thank
you for inspiring me to build on my PC X
cake says dank book probable I'm waiting
look at this I've got the beach ball
like I can't I can't do anything so I'm
reading super chats okay
since emoji oh I'll pay for shipping if
you send me the toasted MacBook it's
still trash but it's expensive trash
also I'll be your color engineer $5 to
send a resume to me to be my color
engineer you know we probably could use
a color engineer but we aren't hiring
that visit how long does this take
I clicked Canada it's like you know what
you know what you're Canadian forget
about it you can wait you can wait
Canadian weird Canadians are very
patient ah here we go
alright u.s. whatever it's called let's
hop on that that gorgeous Wi-Fi that I
will not be sharing my password for with
you so I'm just gonna type some things
and then I'm gonna pretend to type some
other things because I know that from
the sound alone you can reconstruct
passwords now it's like thank you
machine learning and AI now we don't
even have to brute-force anything the
machines have they're too smart
Gareth says throttle me senpai it's a
different kind of throttle but you get
the joke - your pink Lambo is dying use
this $5.00 towards the recycling fee so
it can die a peaceful death thank you
Jericho but actually
we have auto wreckers around here that
will take that for me and they'll take
the few useful parts that remain like
the steering wheel for example and they
will pass them along to happy other Oh
what did I just do don't transfer it yet
we're not transferring it we don't need
any information in order to the thermal
throttle okay let's get signed into the
Apple I do I got this I got this bra as
long as I can remember my Apple ID
password I should be okay oh we
definitely should have put the timer on
stream I have read and I agree I have no
ain't nobody got time to read the entire
terms and conditions right now okay
password you know I don't need one I
haven't provided all what what it makes
you have a password yeah man okay well
let's just let's just go with something
kind of crap okay are you not are you
looking down or what are you not okay
good good that's good a hint hi there ha
useful hints yeah right okay this is
taking longer than I thought I actually
don't set up max very often so I really
I had no idea how how long the initial
setup takes apparently there are 13,000
of you watching to see how quickly we
can thermal throttle this thing so I'm
feeling a lot of pressure right now
Stephen says water-cooled ei9 MacBook
I'd love to find a way but the one time
we did see water cooling built into a
laptop it actually was not a great user
experience and it's not something that
we're really saying we think
manufacturers should jump in and do
Express setup yes
continue continue is grayed out Siri
sure ask Siri oh is that a pay Siri
leader okay you sure sure
it's fine wow that's really fast oh that
is pretty sick I'm just like wow okay
all right
kudos Apple that is the fastest touch
setup I think other than Samsung's swipe
one but I trust this one more because it
lets me like use a bunch of different
parts of my finger that is that is
pretty sick oh wait now let's set this
up later oh crap
uh-oh oh no screw true tone how do I
turn it off
holy crap Thank You Apple this is what
Apple does when they offer you choice
but they've already decided what the
best option is for you the user they
show you what it looks like without true
tone and then they're like yeah you can
go figure out how to change this later
there's no way to turn it off now
they're just like here's a tease
here's your screen not yellow but enjoy
not being able to do that okay setting
up your Mac X cake says throttling well
doing first boot no no not yet not yet
Oh Alexander says you give a super
positive review of those carbon thermal
pads why haven't you used them much
since then um I don't know yet okay
apparently Jake's use them so that's
cool I'll be honest with you I forgot
about them so no no it's fine
I won't need it for this I'm not ripping
this thing open right now I won't need
to open it to thermal throttling now ha
prime95 for Mac apparently exists but I
guess it's not in the App Store so I'm
gonna go ahead and fire that up there
what we will grab in the App Store just
cuz I don't know I might want to see a
more realistic load maybe like the final
cuts look professional install I love
that that's an essential program
according to Apple can I not use touch
ID after serious okay don't don't look
at that don't look at that keyboard okay
think I got it why can't I use touch
didn't I just set this thing up like
didn't I just do that
yeah that's annoying all right so let's
go ahead and fire up the Safari what are
we at right now sixteen no no I want to
know uh yeah the other thing where we
don't for time okay so yeah here's
prime95 OS ten edition nine minutes okay
come on baby gonna do this okay these
all look like text things okay then we
need primarily five can't be opened
because it is from an unidentified
develop this shouldn't count against my
time
your security preference change security
fine fine
security and privacy ah general allow
app somewhat click the lock to make
changes I member okay whatever oh wow
and touch ID doesn't work for this
either okay don't look at the keyboard
how much does he want me to enter my
passwords like they're in love with my
password just that gotta do it again
okay what kind of chimpanzee needs to
use the touch bar to press a button like
unlock instead like you already have
enter okay you know what no don't worry
about it okay sorry I gotta try and
enter this one more time and no offense
to anyone who uses the touch bar to
interact with system dialogues I'm sure
you're I'm sure you're very adept people
at least you can type your password
without doing it incorrect what is it
just oh it wants me stupid why would I
want my username one okay yeah okay I
got to do the legs cheapo throwaway
password alright who's the chimp now
right okay so allow apps downloaded from
the the only two options are app store
and identified developers and app store
advanced what am I gonna have to Google
this if I change it to just app store is
this gonna dance
oh you've got to be kidding me
your security preferences allow
installation of only apps from the App
Store yeah open anyway you have to have
this thing open there is no button for
allow apps downloaded from unidentified
developers Wow
yeah whatever apply okay hours per day
this program will run no no I just want
to do a stress test test crap I've never
here we go torture test okay so all FFTs
there we go baby all right and we also
need hardware hardware info or something
like that
where's where's the app store hardware
monitor there's some kind of hold on oh
no I think there's a mmm okay yeah let's
try a temperature how long is this
taking temperature gate $25 upgrade to
temperature gauge Pro for free after
purchasing and running once fan control
a new feature holy crap $25 that's for
date
he's the touch bar yeah touch bar ooh I
didn't know the keyboard shortcut and
had to use a touch bar you know what
don't worry about it you know I think
we're probably just hardware monitor max
let's try that hardware sensors is there
a hardware monitor like program for Mac
there's it hey it's the Linus tech tips
for him how about that SEO good job
Lucan team very nice all right this one
apparently lacks GPU temps but what do I
care
perhaps the Activity Monitor dock icon
sure
okay oh wow how do I just how do I just
get it okay dying okay back back get
Montez let's try Mon it
watch this be paid three dollars no I'm
not paying three dollars to see the
temperature of my system there has to be
a free way to do this get Fanny widget
sounds like a born thing also bear
domain is dead I mean it could have been
important thing by now given that
they're gone I guess that's what you get
for I guess that's what you get for
giving away apps to Mac users for free
you go out of business
HW monitor thank you thank you stream i
heart you guys HW mother oh this is just
cpuid oh they did they have a they have
a Mac version no I don't I don't see
that okay I'll try and tell power C
Intel probably recognized that it's
ridiculous that you can't just power
gadget for math but you can't just see
your system temperatures and they're
like okay I guess we gotta fix this
let's see if Intel is a verified
developer yes looks like it okay Intel
power gadget here we wait install Intel
power again no oh
only App Store the camera shutting off
what do you mean the camera setting off
oh okay but they can still hear me
probably right yes yeah okay cool pay no
attention to the man behind the curtain
Brandon don't swear we're live are you
turning it back on to this okay there
you go that's that's red that's red
camera streaming reliability for you
right there
don't worry you guys aren't missing much
I'm just installing
the power gadget and also it is letting
me use touch ID to install system
extension blocked what just no just
allow it I don't care
open anyway it's Intel it's fine
probably ok I think it's going now
sheesh
install time less than a minute wait I
can't tell if it's working because if I
go back over here it still says until
power gadget dot pkg was blocked from
opening because it's not from an
identified developer I say open anyway
it comes back to this and it does say
install time less than a minute but it's
not moving so I can't tell if it's
actually working Hey
installation was successful ok where's
my power gadget command-spacebar is like
the only Mac shortcut that I know
because it's amazing Intel power gadget
it is not currently loaded if you just
installed the app please load the driver
by going to System Preferences security
and privacy general and then allows
system software from Intel Corporation
apps I i already what the heck course
right-click is not enabled by default
even though it actually does like
fundamental important things even on the
Mac ok trackpad secondary click oh it's
clicked with two fingers I tried to like
hard click with - ok fine whatever
hah I'm having flashbacks to that video
that I did with Justine oh here we go
now there's an allow button now it's
here this wasn't here before
oh my whole plan was that I was going to
use the TV behind me to screen share
with you guys I even went and got a
dongle for my dongle Book Pro which I'm
informed as an old dead meme joke now
but I don't even care I'm still making
it right there suckas boom ok so is this
open now
Shh what are even happening here there
we go alright Intel power gadget open
hey there it is there it is okay yes
power gadget wow this scaling kind of
sucks like can you even see any of that
holy crap
so all we've done so far with four
percent utilization five six okay I
don't know what is doing five let's say
five all we've done is like install
power gadget and prime95 also I have
Final Cut Pro that is that's fully
installed now and we are at 56 degrees
on the package oh boy oh boy they're um
well that's gonna be fun isn't it
alright let's start a torture test and
let's see how long this takes you ready
kids
twelve thread Boop oh they're way over
here oh we're at a hundred degrees yeah
ah can we see what frequency it's
running at I don't know where is it
Wow so what is it that in amps ia would
that be current in amps eyes current
right yeah current core frequency wait
what current core power oh here we go
current package power wait what oh
that's weird
no nope can we see what what frequency
our CPU is running at which one oh there
we are
oh cool I didn't see that I went your
mouse over this it says current core
frequency so I got confused see that
there's a little gap there where like
the mouse over is broken so we are we
managed to run over three gigahertz for
this long what is that like two or three
seconds Wow maybe that might be about
five seconds and then we drop all the
way down to two point gigahertz and
change and the fan is starting to ramp
up finally finally the MacBook Pro is
figuring out oh you want to do so oh you
want to do something oh
about that now in fairness to Apple
prime95 small FFT is a fairly brutal
workload like that's it's not realistic
necessarily but I bet we can reproduce
these results with something else as
well so let's go ahead and just force
quit prime95 boop boop and then you guys
are about to watch something amazing I
promise it's amazing because I'm gonna
try to do something in Final Cut Pro and
it will amaze you how bad that's gonna
look alright Final Cut Pro I actually
bought this just for the MacBook 2016
video so that I could like see how all
the like fast video encoding times that
the other guys are talking about and it
is really fast it's like actually pretty
impressive alright so man the TV's cut
off outputs like over scanned or
whatever okay so what's a smart
collection oh man you know what maybe
maybe I won't do this all I want is just
to get like a video file okay new
project here we go untitled project yeah
sure okay whatever and then let's get
like a video clip or something right and
Brandon do you know how to use Final Cut
how about import import media does that
seem likely okay cool um okay devices
favorites how do you just go to a
network drive of course you can't just
go to a network drive right I remember
that
Oh oh boy oh boy finder hold on man I
might I might I might give up on this I
might actually give up on this okay
finder preferences it preferences
advanced map map network drive Matt
network drive please yeah I don't
remember how to do this wait connector
server there it is
okay go it's under go sorry I should
have known server address
okay let's try that connect there was a
problem I think you have to Oh
SMB cool so that no that's not working I
get sort of how many people are watching
23,000 people are watching me fail at
final cut oh that's not good okay you
know what then I'm gonna I'm gonna cut
this off the point is it probably
wouldn't I should have just installed
premiere at least I know how to like add
a video clip to a timeline in premiere
I'm like sweating right now freaking out
trying to remember how to do that I
don't remember how your aren't we're
we're onto a flash drive oh cool okay
then in that case I'm gonna burn two
minutes talking to super chat people
while I wait for that Francisco says one
dollar more than the last guy now I'm a
color engineer okay good good good good
on ya DJ asks how much life does a CPU
lose when it's hot like a hundred
degrees okay that's actually a wow
that's actually a really good question
from DJ gaming so we don't know exactly
because it would vary from chip to chip
so some processors are more resilient in
like high high thermal environments than
others that's why and that's true of
actually a lot of components like for
example when you're shopping for
capacitors you can find capacitors that
are rated to run at eighty-five degrees
or capacitors that are rated to run at a
hundred and five degrees so it comes
down to the individual product as for
CPUs we don't know how long Intel like
we don't know what Intel's curve looks
like but we do know that they probably
have one internally like an exact
expected failure rate at any given
temperature range so it would go from
zero at you know zero degrees or some
some very small amount and and they
usually rate failure rate in terms of
per year what percentage of them would
die or something along those lines so it
would go from like very very low and
then it would probably look kind of like
this and then it would have like an
exponential upswing what we know is that
Intel has set some kind
of internal bar for a hundred degrees
being the maximum level at which they
would consider that fill that annual
failure rate failure rate to be
acceptable
so we don't unfortunately know what
percentage of them it will cause to die
but we do know that more thermals makes
it more likely that they will die even
if we don't know exactly by how much so
there you go great question
duck goes quack says I've always
wondered this can you use liquid metal
for a liquid cooled computer no you okay
asks if we can put mercury in the tubing
for a liquid cooled computer
theoretically sure but no that would be
really cool that would be a lot of
mercury that would be like scary stuff
don't worry water has excellent thermal
transfer and and sheet retention
properties we're gonna stick with water
sorry yeah legit dangerous like scary
would be so heavy Aman says thanks for
getting me into tech when I was nine
without her I wouldn't be attending
Stanford for computer science well you
already know far more about it than I do
CJ says just throw it out the window
it'll be better out there actually it's
cooler in my office than it is outside
so you're wrong
unfortunately you spent $13.99 to be
wrong today but that's okay still it's
still hard how's that flash drive okay
Carl figures I'm thermal throttling
thank you for that Erin says if you
right-click the app icon and click open
instead of double clicking you'll get a
dialog that says open anyway oh that's
intuitive Thank You Erin the video guy
who else we got here captain Cheerios
says what happened to Linus is evil twin
with the NSI Dragon Tattoo okay that
wasn't an MSI dragon for one thing and
for another maybe he never left
like getting like a shifty eyebrows
thing going on here ah what else we got
here
ha ha Liam sent 15 euros to say remember
when Apple made an ad complaining about
how often Vista looks for approval and
passwords that is funny isn't it
I like that I like this guy Thomas says
stick some of those heat pipes you had
for DIY heat sink onto the back now that
is an interesting idea like modding out
the MacBook Pro to try to attach some
kind of external thermal solution to it
I don't know how effective it would be
though because we don't even know we'd
have to pull it apart to find out how
efficiently it even transfers heat to
the chassis and then the chassis doesn't
have a ton of surface area like it's
it's less than you might think because
it's flat all right untitled steamy what
is that
it's teen apps oh that's the microSD
that I have in here that's from when I
was trying to do the Steam drive on that
thing sorry I just I I look I opened up
untitled and I thought it was this is an
M KB is this even gonna work
where'd you even get this what is this
oh you recording a stream isn't
interesting
okay import all my god no important yeah
this final cut even support Mk me
I don't yeah why would it dang it Jake
why would you no I don't need these
right now these are just graphite pads I
okay okay I got a got to entertain the
people somehow juggling I'm gonna get it
this time Brendan yes I am
hold on no no no I I did wait I did way
better in one of our upcoming videos on
like budget water cooling I was I was do
you think we could edit that together to
make it look pretty continuous I know
why did I even let him do it this time I
should have just gone back and found my
own stupid video file all right what
else we got in here then buffering says
hi babe
clock man did you know you can run Mac
OS 6.0 point eight on a Nintendo DS I
did not thank you I learned something
today Victor says hello from Russia
cordetta says I bet it doesn't overheat
in Canada their attempts are always
lower oh yeah oh no it definitely it
definitely overheats like basically
instantly I mean there's probably people
here that like missed it so maybe we
should go ahead and just do our demo
again our unrealistic demo and I hate
that's cutoff options torture test here
we go here comes the oh wait hold on
let's get the Intel application up weird
the torture test go how do you how do
you alt-tab on a Mac here we go no it's
fine it's fine I got this you know yeah
let's do a blends test let's have a look
what why is that so messed up look at
that
that's weird hey why does this say you
know what I'm gonna relaunch power
gadget just to see if maybe it's gonna
be less interpreter yeah that looks
better okay cool here comes options wow
the fans are already ramping up in
anticipation I wonder if they really are
can you hear that
I know that's interesting that would be
a cool little piece of tag if the
MacBook was actually watching okay what
kind of applications can I be expected
to get hurt by let's ramp up the fans
proactively because wait no we're at 34
percent utilization right now what's
even going on what the heck is using 34%
of our CPU time nevermind
what does does the Mac have an
equivalent to like task manager like how
do you how do you see what's using your
pride hey Anthony
is there like a task manager equivalent
and Mac OS Activity Monitor thanks brah
okay what's using all the CPU okay
apparently prime95 is already grabbing
30 percent CPU oh okay oh but did I
start the blend test at some point okay
okay I must have but that is so weird
what is it doing yeah it is there is a
worker thread running okay I don't know
why it's doing that so it's only one
worker so whatever let's just sit it
with the torture test then so now our
utilizations at 100% our temperature is
going down
within our frequencies reporting at yeah
2.6 now Oh
so our RAM power goes up because we're
blend testing instead of small FFT
testing this time and then our CPU power
is actually quite down like our power
draw
but we're still nowhere near the
frequencies that this kind of a CPU
should be running it all right oh the
video file is perhaps here although I
don't know whether I can trust Jake to
do anything right it's MP force okay
okay we're quitting time 95
yeah I don't even I don't even I
honestly don't know if it's gonna use
these either okay yes yes we can oh
thank you import selected the closed
window after starting important there we
go thank you
Jake ooh so what do I just like drag it
over or what can I do finger to finger
it here like it's not what you think
ah okay cool so this is what is this
this is the video from Dreamhack
okay so then I just need to export it
how do you do that well export XML no no
file consolidate yeah
share it's not share is it's not share
is it share you - no Final Cut Pro
download additional preferences commands
and it what it's not in our file file
new no oh man does anyone know how to
use Final Cut it's not export you feel
in finder reveal in project browser open
library how is this even possible how is
it not under edit or her file rather
should be under file no why can you
google this this is terrible in in my
defense I over live streaming right now
right okay in my defense I have like
barely touched Final Cut Pro ever okay
yeah I got it
yeah there yeah oh oh this this and then
is it over here command e no I want to
know what stupid button you there are
where the thing you click is command E
you know what forget it fine I will
press command E okay now what
crying out loud alright 31.4 Giggs
estimated say there's more like
nightmare hack now back okay no I don't
want to save it to iCloud just I don't
know desktop why is desktop iCloud what
no I just go downloads just fine okay
now let's bring up the Intel power
gadget how're we doing here okay what
frequency are we gonna run at we peaked
at three oh wow it's already down to two
point five what 2.8 2.9 2.7 and
temperatures still climbing temperatures
still climbing camera shutting down
again they're gonna miss the moment
they're gonna miss the moment when our
real load causes it to throttle I mean
it's already basically throttling at
this point but I mean depends how you
define throttling do you fine there it
goes there it goes look at that they
can't did it shut down again Oh for
crying out loud oh if we had screen
sharing setup oh oh what about this why
don't we just why don't we just rip the
HDMI cable out of here and plug it into
the capture card can we hold on maybe we
could just screen share it you know I
don't have an HDMI kit are we back on
okay so oh so that's fine I can show you
guys the moment I can show you the
moment so we got up to about 90 degrees
in a real workload 88 and then you can
see here where the frequency went from
about three gigahertz down to where as
low as two point three five two point
four two point five and then you can see
right here where the power for the
package went from 30 I guess these are
probably watts probably 30 Watts down to
like 20 watts and then it's settled in
around 20 to 23 Watts here so realistic
work load this thing throttles in a
matter of less than a minute and then
unrealistic workload it throttles in
about three to five seconds and I am
thermal throttled now so
thank you guys for tuning in to the live
three live dream life dream thank you to
all of you who sent super chats of
course Oh Haiti says don't say Google
you triggered literally everything I did
it again sorry and oh yeah what can I do
for you BJ did make it in before the end
of the stream today oh hi again BJ 6969
BJ you are a gigantic troll what else
can I say at that point
Paulo says we have the i9 and that's a
great point I would love to see how the
new XPS with the i9 is behaving as well
because honestly I suspect it's not much
better like we're ripping on Apple a
little bit here but they're far from the
only ones who have had trouble in the
past with what used to be Intel's HK
series of processors and now they're
calling core I 9 but those are their
very high TDP mobile chips so thanks for
tuning in guys
dislike or like check out our other
channels no that's my tech quickie autre
oh crap merge bye-bye merge what else am
I supposed to say I don't subscribe I
will enjoy in the forum during the forum
we'll see you there okay
okay cut it Jake yes yes I'm sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
