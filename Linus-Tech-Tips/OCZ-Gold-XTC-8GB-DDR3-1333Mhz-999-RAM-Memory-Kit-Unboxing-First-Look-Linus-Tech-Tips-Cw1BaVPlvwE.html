started upgrading with every hardware
generation I I used to have a bit of a
personal policy where I only upgraded
once for every hardware generation as
far as as far as ram goes I only
upgraded my ram when when the technology
changed so from you know II do to SD to
ddr2 ddr3 dual channel triple channel
those kinds of things but then I also
always require there to be some kind of
a capacity benefit so dad we've been in
a bit of a rut ddr1 had two gig modules
ddr2 had two gig modules and that was
pretty much the the maximum for the
mainstream sighs kits and now ddr3 has
been stuck at two gig modules for a very
long time but ocz has been kind of
pushing the envelope lately to bring the
price down on four gig modules such that
we can get to the point where a four gig
or rather an eight gig kit with 24 gig
modules is actually reasonably priced no
it's pretty standard looking as far as
OCC's ram packaging goes okay it's a low
voltage optimized for Intel's Core i7 i5
and i3 processors quality performance
and customer support that's all good
stuff why don't we get this opened up
and have a look it uses their standard
gold series heat spreader it's their XTC
heat spreader extreme thermal convection
or something along those lines so let's
pull up this round I actually grabbed
this Ram just one to illustrate sort of
how affordable Ram is getting these days
so you can see there's nothing
particularly impressive about the speed
and timings it runs at 1333 on 999
timings 1.65 volts it's a four gig dim
gets got their their honeycomb heat
spreader which they say gives better
cooling overall than just a straight
metal heat spreader just your standard
green PCB all that stuff anyway I pulled
this out more for like a little
demonstration in my ITX motherboard of
how much stuff you can jam into a tiny
space these days because really
increasingly capacity or the densities
of RAM modules is one of the one of the
better things that you can do to sort of
push whatever I'm kind of rambling here
it's an eight gig kit
it's reasonably priced very cool thanks
