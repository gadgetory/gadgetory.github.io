brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
darn screen protectors out there as well
as hyperx our guys welcome to the
steelseries sweet we're checking out the
m800 keyboard this is similar to their
last apex in the idea that it has the
replaceable rubber plug feed on the
bottom and a lower and higher profile
setting it has dual USB hub ports on the
back which aren't powered but you'll be
able to do some minor stuff with them
and then other than that there's some
changes the layout has changed a little
bit there's slightly less macro keys but
it's probably fine as you probably
weren't using all of them anyways and
there's individual lighting on each one
of the keys instead of zone lighting
like the Hat before I think there was
about five zones before now its
individual lighting everywhere which is
going to be a lot better they've
switched to their own key switch which
now has three millimeters of total
travel distance and a 1.5 millimeter
actuation point compared to Cherry's
which is four millimeters of total
travel distance and a two millimeter
actuation point these key switches are
also rated for 60 million presses and
have a fairly interesting design as you
can probably see on the screen right now
one thing that you do need to note is
that the stem is not a cherry MX
compatible stem so you cannot put on
Cherry MX key switches custom but it
does come with a few swappable things
say if you want to use it on an Apple
computer you can swap out for command
keys or whatever you want to do in that
realm this key switch is a linear key
switch and the waiting is probably going
to be somewhere between a red and a
black that's what they're telling me
right now although I don't know the
exact waiting specification for that key
switch quite yet like I said before
there's individual key switch lighting
there's an LED in the middle of the
switch which is able to do 16.8 million
colors which is customizable in their
software another thing to note is that
the key caps themselves are also a lot
shoulder just like the travel distance
so you'll notice quite a big difference
typing on this keyboard compared to a
full-size key cap and cherry travel
distance keyboard not necessarily a bad
thing just a difference thank you for
