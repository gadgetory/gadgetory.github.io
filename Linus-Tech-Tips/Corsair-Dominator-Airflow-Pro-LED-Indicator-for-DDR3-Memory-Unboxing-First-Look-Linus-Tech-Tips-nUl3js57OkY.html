little while back and I found a very
confusing connector on it I kind of went
No what the heck is this for and I
couldn't figure it out and now I know
Corsair has released a parametric
display for Dominator memory modules
equipped with DHX Pro so you can see
here they've got a picture of this
little module here with a Dominator fan
underneath and then presumably some
Dominator memory underneath that so you
can visually monitor up to six modules
with led-based activity meters easy at a
glance LED displays relative module
temperatures creates an outrageously
cool look to your system and is
compatible with corsair dominator memory
modules equipped with DHX pro requires
the airflow or airflow to memory cooling
module and presumably that little
connector that I couldn't figure out
what the heck it was for okay so let's
have a look at what is included with the
airflow Pro ok so there's a bunch of
hardware I'm not going to take that out
because it looks like I'll lose it but
it some screws and nuts and bolts and
anything inside this baggie
we have little cables that yes connect
to that confusing little connector on
the memory modules themselves ok so
we've got a bunch of those up to six at
a time then we have a molex to floppy
power connector because I guess this
thing is powered by a floppy connector
alright and then we have the airflow
flow itself there it is so it's covered
in LEDs all along the back that's how
you plug in your power as well as your
six memory modules and I have no idea
what that one's for okay and then
there's where the LEDs shine through on
the top that's pretty much it I guess
that's all there is today
I wouldn't mind actually trying this out
because it looks like pretty boss
actually have that on your memory with
like all the let's see what the LEDs
sort of look like there looks like that
that's cool so this is kind of the
successor to
of course score Sarah's old XMS
pro-series memory that actually had the
LEDs built into the top so this is your
activity and usage LEDs and now it's
built into like a not like a common
interface that sits on top of all of
your modules so that's pretty sweet
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the Corsair air series airflow Pro
get another advantage to buying corsair
dominator memory you can buy this
accessory for it and it would look sweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
