little while back and i found a very
confusing connector on it i kind of went
oh what the heck is this for and i can
figure it out and now I know corsair has
released a parametric display for
Dominator memory modules equipped with
dhx pro so you can see here they've got
a picture of this little module here
with a Dominator fan underneath and then
presumably some Dominator memory
underneath that so you can visually
monitor up to six modules with LED based
activity meters easy at a glance LED
displays relative module temperatures
creates an outrageously cool look to
your system and is compatible of corsair
dominator memory modules equipped with
dhx pro requires the air flow or air
flow to memory cooling module and
presumably that little connector that I
couldn't figure out what the heck it was
for okay so let's have a look at what is
included with the airflow pro okay so
there's a bunch of hardware I'm not
going to take that out because it looks
like i'll lose it but it's some screws
and nuts and bolts and presumably how it
mounts kind of thing inside this baggie
we have little cables that yes connect
to that confusing little connector on
the memory modules themselves okay so
we've got a bunch of those up to six at
a time then we have a molex too floppy
power connector because I guess this
thing is powered by a floppy connector
alright and then we have the air flow
flow itself there it is so it's covered
in LEDs all along the back that's how
you plug in your power as well as your
six memory modules and I have no idea
what that one's for okay and then
there's where the LEDs shine through on
the top that's pretty much it I guess
that's all there is today I wouldn't
mind actually trying this out because it
looks like pretty boss actually have
that on your memory with light call the
hero see what the LEDs sort of look like
their looks like that that's cool so
this is kind of the successor to
of course score Sarah's old XMS
pro-series memory that actually had the
LEDs built into the top so this is your
activity and usage LEDs and now it's
built into like a not like a common
interface that sits on top of all of
your modules so that's pretty sweet
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the Corsair air series airflow Pro
get another advantage to buying corsair
dominator memory you can buy this
accessory for it and it would look sweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
