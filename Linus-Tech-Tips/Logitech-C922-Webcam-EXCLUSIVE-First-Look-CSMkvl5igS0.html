c920 2 webcam it is a direct replacement
for the legendary c920 webcam which is
used by a huge amount of streamers
including myself the c920 2 features two
main new modes 60fps at 720p and
background replacement let's see how it
fares against its tried and trusted
older brother
the be quiet dark based pro 900 modular
design supports a variety of different
layouts and configurations click on the
link in the video description to learn
more let's start with the most drastic
feature change they now have background
replacement they've opted not to use
intel realsense we've seen that applied
in a few different background
replacement cameras in the past instead
of using a depth sensing camera they
went with a strictly software solution
which is mainly focused on shape
recognition and comparing contrast
levels now when I first caught wind of
this I thought it was going to be
terrible and it wasn't at all it was
actually rather awesome especially for
an amateur streamer or something like
that it's not going to replace an actual
green screen or blue screen or something
like that but it does a really good job
with what it has which is actually very
impressive especially when we put it in
crazy scenarios like pointing it towards
a window that was partially open in a
super variable back wall something that
it shouldn't do very good with to test
out how well it worked ed and I ran it
through a number of scenarios including
a few different torture tests where we
expected it to really start failing was
mainly when we reduced the light in the
room and to be fair it did get worse but
it was impressive that it actually
functioned at all
we even did some testing where we
rapidly moved the camera around changing
the angle of attack that the camera had
on the person that it was trying to
record this would be problematic for a
camera that is trying to base its
background replacement based off the
shape of your body and we tried it
against a few different backgrounds even
rapidly changing the backgrounds again
there were some problems here but it was
rather impressive that it functioned at
all because this was a pretty intense
scenario for this type of background
replacement now again because it's
basing itself off of shape recognition
and contrast helping it out by giving it
a second to really recognize what's
going on in the scene having a basic
solid background and having ample
lighting could really help it out if you
want to step up the experience now if
you do want to put something like a
foldable green screen or something
behind you even if you don't have the
throw distance and lighting that you
would normally expect from a green
screen experience you can get a lot out
of it by using that in combination with
the background replacement software and
a chroma key through whatever streaming
software you're using I'll also point
out that it had an easier time tracking
myself than
Edsel but I would expect that is
probably due to the reflective
properties of his glasses than anything
else now moving on to 60fps this was
enough to sell me on the camera entirely
by itself before I even heard about the
background replacement stuff it streams
at 60fps 720p just like a huge amount of
twitch streamers because of the max
bitrate cap that twitch has it's kind of
the best way to stream right now so
having your webcam being able to stream
at that same frame rate that same frame
rate that pcmr likes is very very cool
and I must note that checking the
settings is rather important as the fact
of it running at 60fps is a little bit
dynamic for instance if you enable
low-light compensation it's not going to
work it has to slow down the frame rate
so it can get more light per frame
dropping you down to about 15 fps not 60
and enabling other things can drop it
down to 30 even so just make sure that
it's actually functioning at 60 if
that's what your goal is with all the
settings between the C 922 and the c920
set at the same thing I did personally
find the C 922 to be considerably better
especially when looking at my hair you
could really see the older c920 struggle
with loads of artifacting lines while
the newer c 922 handled it much better
managing to look a lot less like the
footage I would expect to come from a
traditional webcam and again I have some
additional notes here I would highly
recommend diving into the manual
settings Ed's will brought this up and I
definitely agree the sharpness seems to
be too low by default they could change
this later on but just so you know and
depending on your setup you might want
to have different exposure contrast
brightness etc etc dive into the manual
settings you can get a lot more out of
the camera that way if you opt to get
the non X version you can get an
included little mini tripod if you want
to not mount it on top of your monitor
like I expect most of you to do and I
would also note that I believe the mic
in here is the same as the original c920
meaning it's pretty bad and I would
highly recommend that you buy an
external mic if you're shopping for this
thing look at it for its awesome visual
qualities not the included microphone
although included with it comes I
believe a few months of xsplit premium
now last but not least for you security
fans out there the form factor is
essentially identical meaning that it
works with the old c920 privacy cover
and considering that FBI director James
Comey has recently recommended covering
your webcam that might be not a bad idea
to pick up or continue using if you
already own it freshbooks is excited to
announce an all new version of their
cloud accounting software it's been
redesigned from the ground up and
custom-built for how you want to work
fresh books is a simple way to be more
productive organized and get paid

professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds and get paid faster and
you can see when your client has seen
the invoice when they've seen it in
their inbox no more guessing games for
your unrestricted 30-day free trial go

tips and enter Linus tech tips in the
how did you hear about a section but now
I want to know what you guys think
are you considering upgrading to this
over your current c920 or if you're
shopping for a webcam is it just better
that this is supposedly the same price
and better in basically every area and
has more features or do you just not
care let us know in the comments down
below or on twitter at Linus tech thanks
for watching check out Amazon to buy one
of these things if you would like check
out the link in the description down
below to buy a t-shirt like this one
which is cool like the video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
get subscribed go on the forum to talk
about this camera and other cool things
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
