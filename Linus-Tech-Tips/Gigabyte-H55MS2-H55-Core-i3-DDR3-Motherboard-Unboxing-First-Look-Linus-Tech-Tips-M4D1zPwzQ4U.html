gigabyte it has a three year warranty it
is an H 55 board and it supports their
3x USB power feature which is pretty
cool because it means that you can run a
bunch of USB devices off a hub and they
will all receive sufficient power it
also has support for on/off charge which
allows you to charge your iPhone or
other high accessory not eyeglasses from
the USB port even when the system is
powered down wow they really don't list
a whole lot on the back like I said this
is a very value oriented board the
reason I'm doing this video it's
primarily just to let people who are
shopping for this board and have a look
at it oh this is a new one warning Wow
looks like a bright yellow warning isn't
it onboard video output is not available
unless paired with an Intel Core i5 core
i3 processor with intel graphics
technology ok ok thank you wow that's in
like every language Portuguese Hungarian
Indonesian what's fun you know this is
always funny to me like when they when
they list what language it is but don't
but list that in English rather than the
language is actually in so like they say
French instead of francais here we have
an i/o shield here we have two SATA
cables hey they finally did it right
check this out two SATA cables not one
SATA and one IDE nice a black and white
cover on this Wow there really like this
is there they're hitting a price point
here black and white cover on the manual
included drivers and utilities DVD don't
use this download the latest off the
gigabyte website and then the board
itself so they are not no frills no
gimmicks just motherboards you know what
to be perfectly honest with you even the
anti-static bag feels thinner than usual
I'm not even kidding like ok here here
here here
this bite this bag it's from another
gigabyte motherboard
let me see oh yeah oh yeah beyond a
shadow of a doubt this is a different
day and the one that I'm holding here
from the other board is thicker the
other ones actually
from a age fifty-five ms2 h so this is
the s2 because it does not have h which
is hdmi so this is vga output only it is
like super ultra value let's start in
the middle where we see our socket 1156
so that supports core i3 s core i5s and
core i7 s you've got your four pin
connector up here in the top left where
it belongs and your 20 4 pin connector
over here on the right and that is
something that I'm really impressed to
see because a lot of the time you see
value boards sacrifice the layout
because it is cheaper to engineer a
board with the power sources closer to
where they actually need to be delivered
but it is way more convenient for
someone trying to build a system to have
them located here and here so kudos to
gigabyte even though this is a value
board they are not cheaping out where it
actually counts we've got two dims sorry
you got to pay a little bit more if you
want to install for games but with
Fordham with 4 gig single dims getting
so cheap these days you can actually put
this with 8 gigs of ram even though
you've only got 2 slots so without
paying much of a premium you can just go
that route 6 SATA drives support it
again very cool to see them not skimping
on those because 6 are supported by the
chipset so put 6 pieces of plastic on
there and everybody's happy
alright down at the bottom we've got our
front panel connectors we've got a
couple of USB headers no palm port we
have one two two fan ports on board on
the motherboard which is about what I'd
expect on something like this you've got
a PCI Express 16x slot you can see it is
wired for full PCIe 16x 2 PCIe slots and
one PCIe 1x slot there's your front
audio connector and then for our back
i/o we've got pretty much bare-bones
although I'm very happy to see a ton of
USB ports on this board that is
absolutely thrilling because that's a
valuable feature for someone who's just
looking to build a value system and they
tend to like a lot of USB ports I can't
explain why okay we have ps2 keyboard
enough VGA out 8 USB ports Gigabit LAN
and 5.1 audio although if you want to
use a mic then you'll need to
we use a 2.0 audio that's pretty much it
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the gah 55m s2 value motherboard from
gigabyte</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
