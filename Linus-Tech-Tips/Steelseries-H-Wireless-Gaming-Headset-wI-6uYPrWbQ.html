more welcome friends to my unboxing and
review of the SteelSeries H Wireless
it's a bit of a spoiler alert' thing
here so if you don't want to know the
results of this video then you better
stop watching now oh you probably do
anyway it's the best gaming wireless
headset I have ever encountered so let's
start with opening up the box and having
a look at what's inside now SteelSeries
whole thing with this is leg free
uninterrupted wireless performance and
it really actually is more on that in
the range test so the first thing we
find inside is the H wireless themselves
and then well we'll talk more about
those in a moment next we find the base
station which has a volume knob as well
as a button on the front a back button
on the front an OLED display that's
actually quite vibrant then it has a
little battery port and finally on the
back analog in chat out power in USB in
and because it has a built-in DAC as
well as optical in an optical
pass-through again utilizing the
built-in DAC next up we find all of the
cables that you can oops possibly need
regardless of where you are in the world
to hook this baby up to what ever you
could possibly want now let's start with
the construction in the looks of the
unit the materials actually feel very
premium and it has a much more subdued
aesthetic compared to the recently
released Siberia elites I think they're
targeting the you know the mature gamer
I guess that I guess i guess a gamer
would have to be at least mature enough
to buy these to be earning their own
money because at $300 they are really
really expensive but they do look good
in terms of features we'll start with
the weight they come in at around 325
grams which is about the same as the
Corsair Vengeance 2100 they feature
dolby headphone dolby digital and
they'll be pro logic too so you can use
whatever virtual surround technology you
want although personally i prefer good
old-fashioned stereo they have
compatibility with pretty much whatever
you could possibly want with via the
analog as well as digital in
so you've got PC Mac Xbox Playstation
phone AV system whatever whatever you
feel like the one feature that they're
touting as a big deal and I actually
kind of agree with them is the fact that
it has swappable battery pack so it
comes with two of these battery packs as
well as a charging port in the base
station so you get up to 10 hours with
each of them so let's say that's
optimistic and you get up to 8 hours
with each of them what you can do is you
can actually charge the other one while
you're using the first one and then they
charge in a couple hours and you can
swap them for virtually unending battery
life I think that's a really cool
feature and then I also think their
share port features really cool as well
now because these are designed to be
used not only in front of a PC but also
in a living room and they you know they
look like something that might make
sense in a living room as more of a
multimedia headphone this is great
because you're not necessarily going to
have a whole bunch of sets of wireless
headphones so now with this little
three-and-a-half millimeter jack down
here you can bring someone along for the
ride and they can listen to whatever
movie it is that you're watching or
whatever game you're playing at the same
time as you I think that's really really
cool now in terms of comfort the H
Wireless fits me like a glove I actually
really really like them for this the
headband is a little bit narrower than I
would normally like but the very soft
foam on the bottom does compensate for
this and there's actually that same soft
foam on the ear cups you can see it's an
extremely slow rebound when you press it
in so there isn't really any break-in
time they're comfortable right out of
the box the pleather on the ear cuts is
also a couple grades above what you will
typically find on cheap commodity
headsets and really feels closer to
natural leather than then again most of
the other pleather products that I've
encountered the weight is about the same
as the Vengeance 2100 which I think I
already said but because that weight is
closer to the center closer to my head
instead of being further out I find that
they don't slip around when I move my
head in the same way that the vengence
2100 Stu that leads us to our range test
now I did five different spots and then
I used the same setup each time so I
actually had a laptop and then the USB
dongle connected to the
a station in my office then I tried the
same room so it's about a 10 foot
maximum the other side of the wall I
tried down the hallway I tried the stair
landing so coming down onto the next
floor I tried the bathroom on the floor
below and then finally I tried the
basement so the H wireless performed
better than the Vengeance 2100 and the
Astro a 50s by a longshot in my range
test however unless you're the kind of
person who's going to kind of wander
around the house listening to music with
your wireless headphones which some
people do I suppose that might not be
that relevant leading into the listening
test so I want to talk about the maximum
volume very briefly it didn't get
uncomfortably loud or extremely loud it
got about as loud as I would go but it
should be noted that the dial on the
back which can be used not only to
adjust volume but also to adjust
settings on the base station here so you
can adjust them either here with with
the knobs and dials or you can configure
in here certain settings that you can
adjust using the headphones themselves
so you don't even have to get up anyway
this is an independent volume control
from your Windows system volume if
you're using the headphones or headset
on a PC so you can use some software
tricks if you wanted to squeeze a little
bit more volume out of them but I found
60 to 70 percent was good for day-to-day
music listening or or like casual gaming
in terms of noise isolation I really do
think that's a strong point for these
headphones the faux leather ear cup
covering does help with this compared to
the cloth covering that isn't used by
both the venules 2100 and the as for a
50s both of which I was testing at the
same time so I could get better context
for each of the products that I mean
this is important because I hadn't
really spent much time with wireless
gaming headphones because I don't really
care that much about gaming headphones
for the most part but more on that
anyway in the listening in the listening
section the H Wireless is fully
driverless on the PC so I was up and
running in 15 seconds give or take once
I plugged it in there is a software
application that you can use to make
adjustments but because this is a
console optimized products you can also
adjust all the advanced features using
the base station or the headphones
themselves so you can adjust your
general volume you can adjust your Dolby
settings the relative volume of game
sounds and chat sounds compared to each
other or there's even a setting to do
that
dynamically so that as chat
transmissions come through your game
volume can lower a little bit and your
chat volume can increase so you can hear
things clearly and you can adjust how
much of a shift there is when that
happens so that's a pretty cool feature
you can also set up any one of the
preset EQ settings or even a custom EQ
if you want but the control wasn't very
Glenn regular and generally speaking I
like a fairly flat EQ so I just found
myself sticking with mostly flat and
adjusting things up a little bit in the
mid-range finally you can adjust your
input source because it does have
multiple inputs as well as assign
profiles for each of those sources with
respect to the EQ Dolby chat volume and
all that stuff on a source by source
basis so it'll remember all that as you
switch between different things which
leads us to the listening tests they
were all performed all three headsets
using the onboard DAC so we used USB
connectivity
for the best apples to apples comparison
and this one I guess I spoil the
surprise a little bit but it really is
probably the best gaming headset I've
ever heard
it's surprised both Brendan and Edsel as
well we all had very low expectations
because it is branded as a say look it's
right there in the box gaming headset
and they just tend to not be as good as
Multimedia headsets but honestly I mean
I feel like for an extra hundred dollars
over the Siberia elites which were they
were good sounding but they weren't good
I mean they were good these are worth it
in terms of audio quality audio fidelity
alone and the fact that they're Wireless
is just a bonus at that point and I
would really consider saving my extra
pennies for something like this versus
the Siberia elites because I don't
personally need multi-coloured onboard
lights I mean I appreciate wireless
freedom and I appreciate great sound
quality but I don't need like 16 point
whatever million colors all that kind of
stuff now let's talk about sheer audio
quality bass performance at very very
low frequencies so this would be my one
criticism you know those frequencies
that will tickle your ears and make your
head vibrate those may feel a fair bit
lacking but I would still say that bass
performance is very good it's tight and
it's punchy and it's good for general
battlefield ambient sounds and great for
listening to muse
but if you're one of those people that
really enjoys that Rumble then they
might not be quite as appealing to you
as they are to me the mids are also not
as strong as some would like but I found
that was able to be taken care of
with a very small bump to the mid range
using the EQ and I would go through and
I would probably set that bump on all of
my different inputs the highs are crisp
and clear without being fatiguing to
listen to which is a bit of a problem
that I tend to have even with good
headphones just because my my hearing is
a little bit more sensitive in that
range so I quite enjoyed listening to
these but you do have to take all of
that what I just said with a grain of
salt because while I do have a fair bit
of experience with wired audiophile
grade headphones I don't have any
experience with audiophile grade
wireless headphones so the only thing I
could really compare these directly to
was other gaming headsets so I I mean I
guess the pricing is something that
doesn't really make sense do these sound
so much better than something like Audio
Technica ATM 50s no probably not
probably similar but those are a wired
headphone and so I don't have the proper
context for wireless audiophile
headphones to know if these are a good
value at $300 but what I can compare
against is other gaming headsets so the
Astro a 50s to me are they don't make
nearly as much sense they're the same
price as the H Wireless they don't
really have any features that the H
Wireless doesn't have and they just
plain don't sound as good and they don't
have as good range and all that stuff
but where things start to get quite
interesting is comparing the H Wireless
to the vengence 2100 s if you're a
strictly PC gamer then a lot of the
features of the H Wireless might not
make sense for you so what you're
getting is you are getting noticeably
better sound quality so that is a thing
but I don't know if it's a twice as much
thing you are getting the swappable
battery feature which is really cool
because the vengence 2100 has a built-in
battery and when you run out you tether
yourself to your computer using USB and
you won't run it as basically a wired
headset you are getting the varied
configurable inputs including console
compatibility so it's nice to be able to
switch between those a 2100 does not
have that strictly a USB dongle for me
the comfort was better and the overall
feel was more premium
but at twice the price its yeah it's up
to you whether you can justify it or not
especially considering that the
microphone really didn't blow me away on
this one it sounds pretty Hollow it
lacks that that AM radio sound that is
typically achievable with a microphone
so close to your mouth I'll give you
guys a listen to it here this is my
audio test with the microphone on the
SteelSeries H Wireless I hope you
enjoyed it and then I'll talk a little
bit about why I feel like with a
wireless headphone or headset the
built-in microphone is so important
compared to with a wired solution
because if you have wired headphones
even if they have no microphone at all
there are many other solutions you can
run another wire for a clip-on you can
put a mod mic on it you can put a
desktop mic on your desk well with
Wireless the expectation is that you can
move away you can leave and so adding
another wire is not a reasonable
solution in this case so I feel like the
the built-in mic has to be good enough
and this one's not that great but it's
usable it's not staticky or or distorted
sounding like the Astro a 50s and they
do get major points for the retractable
mic
I hate boom mics I find they get in the
way I don't like how they can't easily
be adjusted to the very corner of your
mouth which is the optimal positioning
but it just plain doesn't sound as good
as the vengence 2100 mic I do like the
mute button implementation on this
particular headphone though I think I
went and turns them off when I meant to
turn them on there but anyway you do a
quick press of the power button rather
than a hold and there's an indicator
light that is not bright enough to be
distracting but bright enough to be
easily visible that shows you whether
your mic is transmitting or not so thank
you for checking out my unboxing sort of
and review of the SteelSeries H wireless
don't forget to like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment and let me know are they
just off their Gord is $300 just plain
too much for a gaming headset or is you
know would you be shopping for something
like an astro a 50 or something
comparable and now would you look at the
H Wireless and consider it especially
given that according to Linus this
review anyway it's just plain better in
every possible way we'd love to hear
what you guys think about that and last
but not least don't forget to subscribe
