tag under a hundred today we have a
motley assortment of doodads to help you
get more life out of older stuff you may
already own so let's tack them out oh oh
that's terrible
speaking of terrible this sponsor Segway
is but Corsair isn't Corsairs ml RGV
fans feature magnetic levitation
bearings and dynamic RGB lighting check
out their 120 and 140 millimeter
variants at the links below
do you remember the original Gameboy
from 1989 introducing Gameboy it's
horrible it's in stereo and it's games
are interchangeable okay yeah you
probably don't because even people born
in the year 2000 are almost voting-age
now lording anyway
now noobs and veterans alike can have
the original Gameboy experience on the
hyper kin smart boy a $50 device that
marries old-school gameboy controls and
cartridge support with your phones
superior screen and battery life as long
as you have a supported USB type-c phone
Game Boy Advance games aren't supported
and the software experience is a bit
less than streamlined since you actually
need two separate apps to get it working
the smart boy companion app and a
third-party emulator but the buttons
feel pretty dang authentic and it works
on games for both the original brick
Game Boy and the Game Boy Color it is a
little clutch but overall I like the way
hyper can is executed this the hardware
feels durable and using a third-party
emulator makes the smart boy
pretty future-proof our next item is a
real sleeper hit it's an HDMI to VGA
adapter from Dino and I know what you're
thinking does such a mundane object
deserve such a savage logo yes
yes it does it's super compact compared
to competing solutions and doesn't
require any power or any drivers to be
installed just plug one end into your
HDMI port and your VGA cable into the
other and bam digital-to-analog baby as
for why you might need something like
this well it's mostly for
interoperability between new gadgets
like your laptop or latest gen graphics
card all of which lack analog outputs
and legacy tech like an old projector in
a conference room or lecture hall or
basically anything server related now
Dino doesn't do everything you can't
reverse it to adapt AV
a device to an HDMI display the
conversions just one way and you'll be
stuck without audio but there are
slightly bulkier solutions that will
convert your HDMI sound to a
three-and-a-half millimeter jack and I
mean on that subject if your new device
doesn't even have hdmi displayport and
USB type-c adapters to vga are out there
as well
the main point was to highlight that
things like this exist another thing
that some people care about that the
Dino lacks is mounting screws to ensure
that it doesn't walk itself out and
disconnect over time but I personally
think it's more convenient this way
since I'm probably going to be using it
in short bursts rather than as part of a
longer-term deployment anyway next up
well let's say you've connected all your
smart lights so you can control
everything from your phone making your
life much easier until no no wait stop
your bloody family and friends keep
touching the light switches ruining your
setup don't reach for the duct tape just
yet the magnet at light switch covers
are a more elegant way to keep people's
greasy little digits off your switches
these were originally designed to help
people who observe the Sabbath a time at
which they're not supposed to do any
work including switching lights on and
off but they're also great for
preventing people from turning off the
outlet beside your bed that you use to
charge your phone overnight so you don't
sleep in and miss work but if you're
thinking that you can use these to
childproof your switches think again on
that one part of the beauty of them is
that they attach magnetically to the
Feres screws holding your light switch
plate on so they go on and come off with
no work at all
next up we have 12 acoustic studio foam
wedges now first things first these are
not for soundproofing so don't buy them
to keep your neighbor's dog from waking
you up at night okay by definition
pretty much anything with mass will
offer some soundproofing but the main
purpose of these is to treat a room for
recording and playback quality by
removing reflective sounds
Echo's at a foot square and only a
maximum of an inch deep these work best
on higher frequencies and probably won't
be enough to absorb lows like a proper
bass trap would but they're really cheap
and not just functional they also give
your space a professional studio feel
and you can attach them to the wall
without damaging anything by using
adhesive spray like this or strips like
the ones that come with our last item
command brand cord bundlers these things
are seriously shockingly useful you just
stick the hooks to the wall using the
included 3m strips and now you've got a
versatile hanger for cable management
storage and drying out your send lives
after a trip to the beach and who says
you have to stick it to the wall you can
tack it right onto an object to maximize
your stow and go ability but just
because these puppies can hold up to
seven-and-a-half pounds doesn't mean
they're gonna wreck the paint when you
take them off as long as you do it
properly so we just painted a lot of
Wells around here that's why we got
these ones and I guess actually that
leads us perfectly into the disclosure
part of these handy tech videos where we
tell you where all this stuff came from
it's pretty easy this time we bought
almost all of it from Amazon except the
smart boy which was sent to us by high
Perkin those guys were probably hoping
for a dedicated video sorry guys
