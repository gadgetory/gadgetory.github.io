the SteelSeries 9h is the direct
replacement for the much-maligned 7h
which delivered fantastic sound for a
gaming headset but was let down by one
fatal flaw the micro USB connection that
it used on the bottom of the ear cup was
just too fragile
the 9h looks to improve in every way on
the 7h by delivering better sound with
updated tournament grade drivers and by
using steel syriza's newer proprietary
connector to breakout into standard
analog connectors included in the
package you'll get the headset itself a
USB sound card which I'll talk about
more in the software portion of the
review a short cable that attaches
actually quite securely to the left ear
cup and has an inline volume wheel and
mic mute button although the mic mute
button is something I'd like to see
integrated into the ear Cup at this
price but I guess we can't have
everything you get an extension cable
that has the same really nice black and
orange sleeving
and two three-and-a-half millimeter
analog connector choices that let you
use the headset with almost anything a
4-pole for mobile devices and ultrabooks
and two separate three poles for a more
typical PC the nine H's are quite light
a characteristic that I normally
associate with cheapness but their build
quality is actually a strong point the
headset uses metal in the joints between
the headband and the ear cup and the
pleather that SteelSeries is using in
their new products is head and shoulders
above the rubbish included on something
like the Audio Technica m50 s the foam
in the ear cup is plush and thick and
the headband uses a cloth cover and has
actual gaps in the foam to make sure
that it's both cushiony and breathable
unlike the crossfades it doesn't really
put this workmanship on display though
and the 9h s have a very subdued overall
look to them as if they're trying really
really hard not to stand out in fact
only a little bit of subtle orange
stitching and a chromed accent on the
side reveals that this might be a
premium product
now if you compare directly to
audiophile headphones at the same price
the 9h is up against some pretty tough
competition the motocross fades with the
first party boom mic accessory can be
had for about the same price and while
you won't get a microphone or a USB
sound card or anything like that
the legendary audio technica ath em 50s
are also available at this price alright
so to begin with I used the included
sound card for all side-by-side
listening tests instead of my objective
to because it felt unfair to not utilize
an accessory that actually looks like a
pretty solid value I also did not enable
either dolby headphone or Pro Logic 2
because I don't really care for them but
hey they're included if you like Virtual
Surround so that's another value add if
you do happen to like that I burned in
all the headphones and listened to my
usual mix of top 40 music and twitchtv
streams switching back and forth between
the headphones as quickly as I could to
keep the sound of the previous unit as
fresh in my mind as possible so with
that out of the way the 9hs are
musically a pretty solid performer their
bass heavier than I'm used to seeing
from steel series and definitely sounded
a bit boo me with less control in the
low range compared to the em 50s but
they also delivered a much fuller bass
experience than the EM 50s can even if
you were to try to EQ them up the mids
and highs also lacked detailed a very
noticeable way compared to the em 50s
something that bothered me in music but
not nearly as much in games and it's all
going to come down to what you're after
then 50s are very popular but they're
not for everyone they are accurate but
they're made for studio monitoring
rather than entertainment and have a
very flat response curve something I
used to prefer but no longer really find
myself preferring compared to the
crossfades
I couldn't quite put my finger on it the
crossfades had more oomph in the low-end
and a similar lack of fine control over
that low-end but they had slightly
better clarity in the higher ranges but
then that felt somewhat overpowered by
the increased blue meanness and I think
while at this price I'd be happy with
either I very slightly preferred the 9
in terms of sound quality but one
advantage for the V motifs is that with
their fashionable yes you can wear these
out of the house look and solid
construction they're a very strong
competitor for the nine H's next was my
gaming test and for that I focused on
multiplayer FPS Buser titanfall which
really helped me see where SteelSeries
was going with the boom ear sound
signature even if I wish it had a bit
more control if the intended use of this
headset is more than 30% gaming then
it's starting to look like the 9hs are a
very solid option because sound effects
really go for lack of a better word
finally the 19 chooses a closed ear cup
design and noise isolation is fairly
solid and while I'm not sure how much
their double enclosure technology is
contributing to it I can say that they
are competitive with the EM 50s in this
regard and that's a pretty that's a
pretty solid overall place to be the
software's where SteelSeries has really
stepped up in the last few years the USB
sound part updated its firmware in a
matter of seconds after I plugged it in
and their engine software automatically
detected my new peripheral and dumped me
into the configuration utility very
seamless from there I could play with EQ
Dolby settings volume control side tone
or self-monitoring of your own mic
stream to avoid those awkward oops I
left my mic on moments and two fantastic
mic settings compression and noise
cancellation which I'll use for my
microphone test the microphone is
retractable and is easy to position
correctly the microphone is retractable
and easy to position correctly the
microphone is retractable and is easy to
position correctly
so in conclusion the decision to buy or
not to buy will as it always is with
headphones be one of personal preference
the software is functional and easy to
use the build quality is very strong and
the sound quality is good but it's still
a tough choice the 9hs are really good
but we can't ignore other good products
in this price range Corsairs vengence
2100 lacks some features by comparison
and doesn't sound as good to my ears but
is wireless the crossfades might be
preferable if you want to wear them
outside and many people will enjoy the
improved accuracy of the m50 s even if
it costs them some immersiveness and the
microphone and any of the other you know
gaming oriented features like the nice
short cord so you can plug into your
front connectors with extensions and
stuff like that versus being stuck with
a super long cord that's actually quite
heavy all the time so there it is
they're good headphones and they do what
they say they're going to do at a fair
price so if you don't mind the
proprietary connectors and you like the
look and the stuff I said about them in
