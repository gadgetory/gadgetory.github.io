this year check out their YouTube
channel youtube.com slash Kingston
HyperX also thank you to phantom glass
and lynda.com the first thing I have to
say about the steam controller is that
it's a very distant relation to a normal
controller this is very much not a
standard console controller if there's a
game that frustrates you to play on a
touchpad with a laptop it will probably
frustrate you to play it with this
controller that being said I don't mind
the shape upon originally seeing it I
assumed due to its shape that I really
wouldn't like it at all but that ended
up not being an issue and also the
haptic feedback on the touch pads was
actually really good the triggers were
solid and the shoulder buttons while not
going down that far before they actually
ate and not really depressing that much
at all were totally fine the buttons on
the back were kind of an interesting
addition that I've seen in aftermarket
controllers a lot but not too much on
standard controllers and we're actually
pretty cool and seemed to work quite
well and felt quite good overall but the
layout was a little weird ABXY was in a
really weird spot I'm used to an Xbox
controller where this is in the top
right where the touchpad is on this
controller and I don't necessarily think
that the touchpad being swapped position
with the ABXY would actually make any
sense
it just feels awkward playing shooters
on this thing was weird
that being said playing something like
dying light where there's a melee weapon
it wasn't quite as bad but then if
you're gonna aim for the headshots it's
gonna be a problem that this controller
is interesting describing this
controller becomes a problem because
it's so different than anything you've
probably ever used it's kind of like a
laptop because you have a touchpad and
that's where a lot of your fine control
comes from but then it's obviously not a
laptop it's kind of like a controller
because there's ABXY buttons and
triggers and stuff but then there's two
touch pads the positioning of this
controller is also an odd question it
doesn't really replace a standard
controller for a lot of different games
over-the-shoulder adventure games I'm
probably still gonna want two sticks and
a better positioning of the ABXY buttons
for twitching to them and hitting stuff
like QuickTime events very quickly and
for racing games again I'm still gonna
want two sticks for shooter games I'm
just gonna want an actual Mouse instead
of a touchpad so where does it fit well
it fits in a nice niche for games that
we're never designed to be played with
the controller but you really want to
you might actually be able to use it for
that and games where honestly we've been
saying this on all along like
civilization and portal it still works
great and allows you to play that on
your TV with ease in short I don't think
the steam controller actually replaces
your controller I think it just augments
your controller I would still want to
use an Xbox 360 controller on my home
theater box whether it was a steam
machine or not and I would also want to
have a steam controller to fill in the
gap for games that don't work very well
with the xbox360 controller in the end
while commenting on it and looking at it
at a show is cool and all this
controller more than any other
controller I have ever tried in my life
will take some getting used to and a
review for this would take a few weeks
of actually using it so I'm not gonna
comment too much more they get a HyperX
