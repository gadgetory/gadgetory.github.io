coverage this year check out their
awesome skins at the link below so we
find ourselves in the Acer suite where
they seem to be aimed squarely at that
dell inspiron kind of value gaming
machine that we checked out a while ago
on the channel over here this right here
is the aspire V x-15 it's kind of a mid
tier sort of feeling machine so yeah it
doesn't have the greatest hinge I've
ever seen but I'll give them credit for
the keyboard it actually has
surprisingly little flex for a system of
this caliber so it's going to be priced
somewhere in the neighborhood of 800 to
1,200 US dollars and you are going to be
getting actually a surprising amount of
hardware for your buck so anywhere from
a core i5 7300 HQ with 8 gigs of DDR 4
RAM in a GTX 1050 with a 256 gig SSD all
the way up to a core i7 7700 HQ with a
gtx 1050 TI 16 gigs of ram either of
them could be upgraded to 32 gigs as we
discovered after the fact and up to a
512 gigas SD and one terabyte of
mechanical storage now of course as with
any value notebook I'm looking for the
places where they cheaped out a little
bit and initially I thought that the
1080p display was going to be one of
them but in actuality while the spec
sheets at IPS this one was clearly TN it
turns out that that's just something
Acer does on their pre-production sort
of mechanical sample models to save a
little bit of a cost makes perfect sense
to me it turns out where they did save a
little bit of money was on the i/o so
instead of getting Thunderbolt 3 or you
know USB 10 gigabit or anything like
that you get an SD card reader a
headphone microphone combo Jack normal
USB 3 five gigabit on the one side then
you get a couple more USB 3s HDMI
Gigabit Ethernet and a type C but still
USB port so that's not actually a
fundable 3 port or anything like that
ventilation looks pretty solid and in
terms of styling you can tell they're
inspired by their predator line with red
accents and all of that but they're
still using the a-star branding on this
one trying to go after someone like the
the traveling professional who wants
something they can game on in the hotel
room but isn't embarrassed to pull out
in a boardroom so thanks for checking
out this video on the V x-15 from Acer
don't miss any of our show coverage by
making sure that you are subscribed to
Linus tech tips and also a huge shout
out to D brand the sponsor of today's
content D brand is the place to go if
you want to get a flick skin for your
laptop your phone your game control your
game console whatever the case may be
they are precision fitted they're
affordable and they ship worldwide not
to mention that they make your devices
look a little bit cooler and make them a
little bit more incidental scratch and
scuff resistant not that I would have
any problems with dropping my devices or
anything like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
