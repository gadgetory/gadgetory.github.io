I want you to see indeed it looks
so last year in April I saw the
Blackmagic Ursa mini 4.6 K for the first
time and I was surprised by what
Blackmagic was attempting to achieve in
a low-budget production camera so kenny
Ursa mini live up to all the hype
surrounding it since release or is it
another Blackmagic release late and
buggy it's definitely one of those
things let's find out if it's both
cooler masters master k's maker 5
features their freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link below
to start things off Blackmagic has
essentially taken their original Ursa
form factor and shrunk it down to in my
opinion something that is much more
sensible for the target end-user at the
back the Ursa has a Lancie connection an
SDI out STI in timecode in a four pin
XLR port for power and a headphone jack
moving to the right of the camera we
have a second SDIO and four pin XLR port
made specifically for use with black
magics electronic viewfinder an optional
accessory then on the top of the camera
we have two three pin XLR ports for
audio along with four quarter twenty
mounting points for accessories such as
black magics top handle at the very
front we have a much-appreciated black
magic staple a built-in mic for scratch
audio on the left of the camera we meet
the 5-inch 1080p capacitive touch screen
which opens up away from the camera
camcorder style directly to the right of
the monitor we have the audio dials and
other controls as well as two dual C
fast 2.0 slots a tough decision that
Blackmagic made with a lot of pros and
cons let's start with the cons C fast
2.0 cards which may be the wave of the
future you can learn more about them
here are not cheap right now a 64 gig
card one card runs north of 200 dollars
making matters worse that 64 gig card
gets you about six minutes of record
time at 24 fps in the Arsene minis
highest pro res recording setting and
even less in uncompressed raw before you
even need to offload my solution has
been to use the etosha C 2's AC fast SSD
adapter that allows you to seamlessly
use SSDs in place of C fast cards
without getting into too much detail my
experience was usable at best you can't
close the LCD many SSDs even ones that
should probably work are detected
inconsistently and the up for
cost of the box is frankly ludicrous but
I would still recommend it or something
similar over loading up on cephas cards
at this time because ultimately I didn't
lose any footage and I did find some
drives that worked well and thanks to
the much higher available capacities of
SSDs Samsung's 3.8 4 terabyte PM 863
worked really well for me I didn't have
to constantly be concerned with the
dreaded countdown timer with that other
way let's get into what makes this
camera really special that wonderful
super 35 4.6 k sensor so let's shoot
some resolution charts right no black
magic also boasts that the Ursa mini
delivers a whopping 15 stops of dynamic
range and if you're not sure why that's
important you can learn more about that
here so instead I took the earth out on
a date in the real world covering
lighting situations from harsh noonday
Sun to sunset along the water and look
at this from the darkest shadow to the
brightest highlight nothing in this
image is clipped I love our daily driver
the a7s2 but compared to its roughly 12
stops of dynamic range the Ursa minis
capabilities are noticeable as much more
than a spec sheet on paper and when
reviewing the footage after each day I
was truly astonished by some of the
results black magics color science this
time around has taken a huge leap
forward compared to their previous
cameras which always had strong green
casts in their film setting making it
much more difficult to grade them and
this is not the case with the Ursa mini
viewing the footage in rec 709 while
shooting in the camera's film setting
was a pleasure skin tones for me in
particular really came to life and gave
the footage a really natural feel
something that has been much more
difficult with our current staple of
Sony cameras usability is a solid point
for this camera you'll need to find your
own battery plate and batteries either
v-loc or gold mount and like a lens but
it's basically grabbing go from there
when recording you can choose between a
wide range of options with every flavor
of Perez from their 444 XQ down to pro
res proxy as well as compressed three to
one and four to one raw recording though
looking over the footage I could not
tell the difference visually between raw
and ProRes 4444 so you can't really do
wrong either way it is a shame that in
order to access the camera's full 4.6 K
resolution you are required to shoot in
one of
raw recording options but this is a
minor complaint in my eyes considering
how good the UHD image already is
even the built-in 5-inch monitor is
pretty darn good the touch interface is
both responsive and simple to use almost
to a fault as it hides fairly basic
camera controls beyond aperture behind
two button presses and takes over the
entire screen making previewing your
adjustments a bit of a pain the two
mapable buttons on the side of the
camera will hopefully help with this but
in the current firmware that I'm using
they don't do anything so I'll just keep
waiting black magic but for the best
results I'd still recommend something a
bit better to make judging exposure
easier Blackmagic CBF while pricey at
fifty hundred dollars was an absolute
treat to use if you shoot outdoors a lot
but the built-in monitor really is very
good and I'd consider it an upgrade to
be a nice to have not an absolute need
to have but that's all fine and good
tooling around downtown Vancouver by
myself how does it hold up in more
realistic cinema style applications
where I have a decent sized crew
I wasn't sure so I gathered a few
friends and we shot a short on Saturday
to my surprise the camera held up very
well once I found the right combination
of rigging parts I was able to keep
focus on the content of the short
instead of thinking about any technical
issues of the camera high praise indeed
and the monitor showed us its strength
when we put it up on the jib in the
middle of the day without a second
monitor use allowing us to get this shot
and the praise keeps coming initially
when I heard the Ursa mini would include
up to 120 FPS slow-motion I didn't give
the feature much thought but after
trying it out
damn in the past we've always had to use
external devices and media to record
slow motion continuously rather than
only in short bursts the Ursa handles a
60 FPS recording at three to one
compressed raw and up to 120 FPS at 2k
with a windowed center to internal media
what is even better is the fine control
that you have over frame rate we use 35
frames per second on a recent channel
super-fun shoot to get the desired
effect and the fact that it records
audio why doesn't every camera do this
however it's not perfect at 1080p with a
windowed sensor exposing at 800 ISO the
image gets a bit too noisy and soft to
be usable but if you can avoid shooting
at higher ISOs in this mode specifically
there is a lot to love here and on the
subject of high ISO is black man
design Marisa may need to be used with
lighting or ample natural light this is
not I repeat not intended to be a low
light camera which is how I plan to
convince Linus to get me to keep the
a7s2 fs5 and this new toy different jobs
need different tools Linus wouldn't use
an eye fix-it kit to repair his car
would he maybe you would which brings me
nicely into my conclusion Blackmagic has
been changing the camera industry since
2012 their style of delivering
unheard-of features and performance at
unbelievable price points have made
their customers Linus media group
included forgive some of their faults
and none of that changes today the Ursa
mini 4.6 K is a camera that to me
unlocks creative avenues I never would
have dreamed of possible at a price
point under $10,000 from the improved
color to the reasonable size to the
excellent codec support I think you see
issues aside and I've got a little post
under the video with my experiences with
that black magic has a true winner of a
camera on its hands and going forward
once we get our own unit to keep the
LTTE studio has its new a camera it's
just such an astonishing image to work
