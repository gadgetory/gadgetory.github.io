look and I'm totally gonna do this I'm
gonna put on the little we're filming in
60fps which will be at zero benefit to
y'all on the the youtubes but that'll
make the motion clearer for when I
review the footage later this is the
avermedia wreck central live gamer HD
capture and share your pc game footage
okay full HD 1080p there's a sticker on
here so it seems it was probably added
some time after the packaging design but
you can live stream with xsplit this
thing is very very compatible with
xsplit streaming software and it makes
it very easy to use see no plastic seal
this is not my first time opening this
product I have actually used it already
and it's pretty friggin awesome so let's
go ahead and have a look at the back of
the packaging here and I want to show
you guys what's going on so we got HDMI
or DVI connectors you can just use you
can adapt DVI to HDMI so it has an input
and an output that's how it gets a
signal from your video card and then
passes it through to your monitor it
uses a PCI Express interface because due
to the enormous amount of bandwidth
involved in capturing HDMI it does need
PCIe it has an h.264 Hardware
compression engine built into it so the
major advantage of this approach versus
something like a Blackmagic intensity
Pro which is one of the other most
commonly used HDMI capture cards is that
while you lose some of the color depth
and some of the sub sampling and whatnot
you gain the fact that your CPU is not
responsible for doing any of the
compression remember guys if you're not
compressing 1080p footage you're gonna
be working with enormous files that
you'll have to have like a multiple
harddrive array or an SSD to even copy
those files from the capture device to
your hard drive alright moving right
along you got a dedicated record button
so you can easily just press the button
when you're ready to record and rec
central so that's their software rec
central allows you to configure it as
much or as little as you want so you can
either use the totally I forget what
they call them that it's like capture
wizard or amateur so you can there's
three different wizards that you can use
to set it up and one of them is so
simple you basically press the
and then it's ready to go you can record
voice commentary with your game playing
that's good it does have a pass-through
for audio as well
extreme your live gameplay over the
internet using twitch TV or xsplit xplit
to twitch TV profile selection over you
yeah the profiles those are easy so
there you go the maximum recording
quality is 1080p at 30fps you can also
do 720p at 60 FPS if you prefer to have
a more fluid framerate versus a higher
overall resolution remember most people
watching your video are not going to be
watching it at fullscreen so if you
filmed at 720p in order to get better
fluidity especially for something like
FPS gaming you might find that to be an
advantage the packaging is excellent say
they got like a cool little sort of
shimmery black sort of thing going on on
the cover for this and oh right another
reason you might want to film at 720p
60fps is if you're capturing from a
console so it's fully capable of
capturing from the PC your gaming on
from another PC that you're not gaming
on although there's not much point in
doing that because a big part of the
advantage is the built-in the built-in
video engine in here that makes it so
you don't have to waste CPU cycles and
you can also use it to capture console
footage on a PC that is nearby so before
we get too far into the device itself
let's have a look at all the other stuff
that's included so first things first
there's our ready to record button it's
just a USB sort of software enabled
Hardware button that you can keep up on
your desk we've also got their software
which is included but you can also
download on the avermedia website
they've made so many revisions to the
software over the last little while that
continue to improve it I'm very
impressed with the way that they
continue to support the product
sometimes you see these kinds of
products where they're kind of
purpose-built
specialty pieces of hardware and they'll
kind of release it and it'll go oh yeah
I know the software is fine just don't
worry about it
but it's not fine and you do have to
worry about it in this case they are
actually trying to make sure that
they're keeping everything updated and
everything ku xsplit broadcaster gift
certificate okay cool so apparently
they're giving me a deal on xsplit
xsplit is awesome by the way xsplit is
what I used to do my live streams
um okay contact me okay we're not going
to worry too much about that let's have
a look at included accessories so just a
three and a half millimeter audio cable
oh look at that they include a DVI to
HDMI adapter so if you wanted to capture
HDMI in from a DVI output on a video
card you just go like that well you'd
have to have a DVI cable out to this but
you guys get the point so you might go
HDMI out to your DVI monitor and so
everything would be cute and then this
one is for the other way around right so
this one so you can go out from DVI from
your video card and then use a small
HDMI cable to go into here and they
actually include the HDMI cable you need
so they include pretty much all the
cables you need to get going
because you'll already have DVI out from
your from your video card that's what
they're assuming so you just excuse me
sorry you swapped this you use this HDMI
cable to go into the input and then you
go DVI out to your monitor and you're
ready to go so we'll have a close look
at the card itself it's got sort of a
you know shield on it that may or may
not do anything but looks really nice
it's got like a brushed metal finish on
it there's your PCI Express 1x interface
flipping over to the back and just got
some logos and stuff and this is the
business end
so there's your HDMI out that goes out
to the device you're going to be using
to monitor what's actually going on so
your monitor your TV
there's HDMI in that goes from the
device that's outputting the signal you
want to capture audio out and audio in
to go along with those although you are
not forced to use the analog connectors
you can also capture audio over HDMI
which I have done with this card already
so what's the point
lots of people are streaming on xsplit
ok do yourselves a favor go look up
PewDiePie on YouTube mind blown it's the
most bizarre thing in the world but he's
making hundreds of thousands of dollars
streaming games and sort of having a
webcam going in the background so I'm
not saying that you buy one of these
you're gonna make back your investment
like that but if you're good at it then
there's a huge advantage to having
something like this because instead of
using up CPU cycles which will cause
your game performance to degrade because
unless you have a beast CPU that's just
what happens this does all the
compression of the footage on its own
you can use it to capture external
sources such as consoles as well so it
gives you more flexibility and it works
very seamlessly compared to and the
compatibility is better compared to the
Blackmagic intensity Pro that I also own
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the AVerMedia
