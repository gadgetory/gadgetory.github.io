with my son when he was three it was
pretty straightforward with this one I
think it's gonna be a little more
challenging I don't like you
honey did you put that in the water
before sponsored by Intel and their
x-series processor family learn more
about their most powerful lineup of
processors at the link below
this bin right here has most of the
stuff we're gonna need for today and
then this right here is the case that
we're going to build the computer in can
you carry this for me no thanks it's too
heavy
can you carry this for me great job okay
should we head downstairs and start
building well honestly the one that was
on there already is probably the right
one see I knew you knew what it was for
that's right okay so something I have to
do is take a couple of screws out of
here before we start so can I borrow
that thank you darling do you like these
fans yeah well what color would you like
us to make them you want them to be blue
did not see that one coming with the
theme of this build but sure yeah we can
make it blue I just assumed her color
preference yes yes I did
we will blue and pink okay we can do
that no problem so you'll have to tell
me it's white and pink do you like it
yeah and it's small just like you so you
and I are gonna put all this stuff in
there
you bet so this is the only board on the
market that can take an 18 core Extreme
Edition and put it in a tiny little case
like this those are for plugging in
headphones and microphones and speakers
everything is interesting to you into
three so this right here is our Extreme
Edition processor do you want to put it
in okay so we're gonna put that side in
where the triangle is so you're gonna
hold it kind of like this if you like
that gentle gentle gentle
that's it
I'm gonna push it down push my
specialization so we're gonna put a
cooler on it is that sound good or not
this could take forever and you know how
to press these things right it's like
the medicine thing for the baby right
okay you know how they work yeah Wow
good job great job honey
awesome job you push all the way done
great job okay three oh good job there
we go how's that look
yeah and we're gonna push it down push
push push push
there we go yeah
maybe we're strong enough together now
this was actually custom done for you by
K slabs you know that they did a special
color just for you so we need a power
supply of course they're sent over there
SF 600 so TAC sent over there GT X 1080
TI Arctic storm mini this is just about
the most powerful graphics card you can
get yeah it does do you work on those
screws it's actually pretty safe thing
for her to work on mostly Thomas from
cable mod did us up some special cables
for our power supply - do you like them
are they pretty picky man so remember
those headphone jacks and stuff back
here they all hook through there neat
huh
oh good job do you want to see an MDOT
to drive oh can you help me with this
one actually sniffing ah you're gonna
sip my fittings off I don't thank you
maybe you don't like my fittings check
that out good helping okay well that's
not the case screws but at least I have
the radiator screws okay I dropped it
is that what you think let's do the
power cables for our graphics card do
you want to help me with that mm-hmm all
right that's fine well that's so we
ended up with probably not more than an
inch of extra wiring for our duel eight
pins for the graphics card our eight pin
for the motherboard in our 24 pin here
this is coming together really well well
it's not quite done yet
I want you to sit with you for a bit so
we'll just continue without my helper of
it okay so my previous helper abandoned
me so I got a new one I'm hoping this
will be a slight upgrade
do you think maybe Teddy and you want to
come help us with the computer again
honey are you upset because I was
working on it without you okay but
sweetheart you said that you were done
helping me remember you want to help me
draw some circles on here all went in I
changed it well you know the thing about
building a computer is that you actually
don't do a lot of snipping that would be
more if we were like taking it apart you
know hi darling
grab on to where are you pulling me up
oh you're standing laughs ooh I see the
water move around in the loop
whoa oh look at it go oh you can't
actually pump it anymore once it's on
okay I heard our computer is completely
bad guy free is that right
Oh keep out of the water please doubt it
hmm
honey did you put that in the water
before Oh No fainted okay because if we
painted the computer with water then
that might actually be okay do you want
to come over and try turning it on no
all right Wow
can you help me press that button all
right so here we go check this out
cor I 979 80 X e 2.6 gigahertz what
actually we forgot about something these
fittings on the top so walk to the
workshop yeah I don't think you're gonna
want to witness this kind of carnage
anyway all right let's go fire it back
up with the side panel on it
what do you think well that is all the
information I needed thank you for your
