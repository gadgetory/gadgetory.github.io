more welcome to my unboxing and overview
of the asrock n8 their tagline for it is
unstoppable and while I might have
agreed with that if they had made it out
of something other than aluminum alloy I
think you could stop an MIT X system
made out of an aluminum alloy it just
might be uncomfortable particularly if
it hit you in the head alright let's
have a look at the packaging so the
first thing we find is a very healthy
feeling accessory box followed by a yes
awesome closed cell foam as Rock expects
this unlike most computer cases to be
shipped with a fair amount of weight to
it because not only is it a very
well-built chassis and Linus how are you
saying all this stuff before you even
opened it all I've seen it before so not
only is it a very well-built chassis it
also has a pretty significant amount of
hardware in it and it can hold a
significant amount more so the first
thing we find opening it up is the usual
do not eat of course please do not eat
this put it away put it in the garbage
keep it away from babies all of that
good stuff and then we find the chassis
itself this is the m8 it was designed in
collaboration I have it upside down with
BMW design works USA it uses oh man it's
just absolutely gorgeous I mean we'll do
some b-roll of this but I'll still try
and show it to you guys a little bit so
it can be configured either to stand up
like this or you can lay it down on its
side it actually has a G sensor a
gravity sensor for the front OLED
display that also has a little
rubberized our soft touch knob around it
so you can use that for a variety of
different functionality you can use the
knob to control things like volume as
well as power management as a display
that can show you a clock CPU usage CPU
clock speed all kinds of cool stuff like
that they have a little application in
command yes a command so to me this baby
really is about form and function so
while I will spend a lot of time sort of
getting Aldo
right over the gorgeousness of the
exterior as well as the industrial
design here I would like to take a
moment to show this to you guys it is
also extremely robust you can actually
use these cross braces here around the
outside as handles for the unit you can
move it around that way and you're not
going to risk damaging it in any way so
here in the front we have a slimline DVD
rewriter that is actually included four
USB 3.0 ports as well as a nice little
stealthy I love this nice touch
boom front headphone and microphone
jacks as well as an SD card reader so
this is hooked up via USB inside we also
find just I really quite like this a
stylized sort of maze-like pattern over
over the ventilation holes so you can
actually see there are two 60 millimeter
fans in here the fans are arranged in a
bit of an unusual configuration by
default but what you're going to want to
do is have a look at the kind of system
you're installing and optimize it
yourself for the best possible airflow
you have more sort of airflow here
you've also say ah yes this is a
bare-bones folks so it actually has a
motherboard included and asrock has done
a great job of including a motherboard
that isn't a piece of junk that you're
going to have to remove and they've
included a standard mini ITX board which
means that when it becomes time to
upgrade it you will actually be able to
throw a standard component in there and
upgrade the system fully big thumbs up
to asrock for that one so you've also
got a power in here so there's going to
be an internal cable presumably
somewhere inside running to a power
supply then we move around to the bottom
of the unit where we find two more fans
so a couple more sixty millimeter fans
so this one's intake that one's exhaust
it's a very very strange configuration
as well as a couple of rubber feet right
here that keep it from slipping and
sliding around all over the place
depending on how you're using it on the
left hand side where traditionally we
would see all of the internal components
we have some of the most gorgeous cable
management that I've ever seen in a
pre-done system I mean this is fantastic
this is the kind of thing that Apple's
philosophy I think really reminds me of
and that is that things should look
beautiful whether you can see them or
not and if you're proud of it I guess
you might as well show it off and put a
window on it I like it and there's
another sort of stylized window
the other side here that allows you to
actually see the components inside so
this is where we can see the motherboard
the PCI Express riser the power supply
as well as some other stuff now I want
to show you guys the accessories that
are included very briefly here you've
got six SATA cables why would you need
six SATA cables you might ask well I
might answer because you can actually
install six SATA devices inside so
there's the optical drive there's a two
and a half inch SSD drive and then
there's a three and a half inch drive
bay that can also be converted to four
SSDs should you so desire you have some
included screws and included power cable
included keys and included pen and
included screwdriver so that's four
that's like a hex screwdriver as well as
little feet for mounting it horizontally
so that you don't damage it so you can
actually see there are little
indentations here so you can put it down
whichever way you want there on both
sides and then this key right here which
is going to allow us presumably to open
up the chassis so these guys are held on
magnetically so there are actually no
screws that is completely tool-less
magnets are basically magic I'm a big
fan of them I think that everything
should be magnetic actually the side
panels feel quite robust you can see the
the gauge of the aluminum is actually
quite thick there so normally with an
aluminum chassis it's going to have a
bit more flex than a steel one but if
you use thick enough aluminium then it's
not an issue at all so we're going to
start on that side that had the cable
management on it again this is just
absolutely beautiful aluminium no
plastic so this is all red anodized
aluminum this piece right here is
plastic but that's about it other than
that we've just got nice sleeved power
supply cables running from where they
need to go to where they came from
all right let's shifter around to the
other side and have a look at the layout
of the internals so first of all there
is our DVD CD rewritable Drive over
there so that could be removed and
replaced with a different slimline slot
loading optical should you so desire
here is our standard SFX power supply
that is a 450 watt power supply so that
will be able to handle even something
like a 4770k
and something like a GTX 780 to go along
with it however that will be quite tight
it's not going to you're not going to be
able to run much more than that we can
also have a look at the custom
motherboard that asrock does include
once again okay I don't mean cust
and custom form factor I mean custom
it's designed for this machine but of
course you could put a different mei TX
board in here so this is the CAG seven
and eight and it includes AC wireless as
well as Bluetooth 4.0 it includes sound
core 3d audio which is something unique
about this is the fact that it can
handle headphones that have up to 250
ohm impedance so it actually has a
decent headphone amp on the front panel
audio that's very unusual often even
good onboard audio solutions skimp on
the front panel audio implementation it
has a PCI Express 16x slot that leads up
to this riser right here so the graphics
card actually goes I grabbed a graphics
card this is a GTX Titan so the graphics
card actually goes a little bit under
there you can see that a ten and a half
inch card like that is going to fit just
nicely just barely one unusual thing is
that it does use sodium slots you can
see what asrock was doing here those
they wanted to give you the options to
install all six of the SATA devices that
you can potentially have in here so they
include all the SATA cables you need all
the SATA ports you need and in order to
do that well the app to use sodium's the
good news is that sodium's really don't
cost any more anymore they cost about
the same as a standard dim we've also
got intel gigabit lan so that's a really
nice thing to see I don't think we went
over the i/o in detail here so on the
back there's four USB 2.0 port eSATA
DisplayPort HDMI Intel Gigabit LAN four
USB 3.0 ports that's a total of eight of
those as well as that 7.1 audio out
including optical audio out so here's a
look at the G riser card which is all
eight G reisen something I don't know
what I'm talking about anyway so that's
just a straight pin to pin PCI Express
riser card so that came out of the slot
right here then the next thing you have
to do is remove those giant hex screws
up here and then you can pull off the
top of the unit so you can actually see
how they're using a fan splitter to
power those two fans and you can
actually see as well that you can
unscrew those fans you can undo this
cage and you can swap around the
orientation as needed which is important
because the stock orientation is a
little bit funny with this as an exhaust
and this is an intake which will work
that is
just bizarre that's just not a very good
idea because the graphics card even a
blower design graphics card is going to
then go in like this so you would want
the fresh air coming in this way and the
exhaust coming out away from this so
like no matter how you slice that that
just that's not the greatest thing ever
but the good news is once we get around
behind here we find the three and a half
inch or four by two and a half inch hard
drive sled as well as the way to
actually get the graphics card in there
so you just go ahead and remove this
piece right here undo the two screws and
install the graphics card the way that
you normally would so what I would
probably do is go up to intakes here get
some positive air pressure going on in
here I'd probably go intakes at the
bottom as well just because there's so
much general ventilation on this case
that the air is not really going to have
anywhere to go except out the back for
the most part so I think that pretty
much wraps it up guys if you're looking
for something that is mostly pre done
for you although a little bit tricky to
a little bit tricky to put together if
you're not willing to look at a manual
you will definitely need the instruction
manual which fortunately is quite clear
and outlines each of the steps in
exquisite detail so if you're looking
for something that's a little bit I
don't know I can't call it easier for a
first DIY DIY computer anything like
that but at least the hardware selection
is easier because it comes with pretty
much everything you need so you're going
to want to add storage you can put in
pretty much whatever you want there I'd
probably just throw in an SSD and a hard
drive and call it a day you're going to
need a CPU so any LGA 1150 CPU is going
to do just fine you'll use the stock
cooler or a very low-profile cooler from
the likes of Silverstone or Noctua would
be quite appropriate you'll need sodium
Ram sojust ddr3 1600 anything like that
along those lines and you are pretty
much ready to rock once you get an
operating system installed and you throw
an optional graphics card and you don't
have to run it with a graphics card
because you do have those HDMI and
DisplayPort ports on the back thank you
