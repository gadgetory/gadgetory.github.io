hear on Linus tech tips today we're
going to be doing our first how to
basics video are we show you how to
install a graphics card into your
computer a lot of newer system builders
and computer novices can get a little
bit nervous when installing a GPU since
it can be one of the more expensive
parts of your PC but don't worry the
process is actually quite
straightforward as long as you keep a
few points in mind the gtx 980ti VR
edition from EVGA provides an
industry-leading graphics experience as
well as a five hundred quarter inch bay
with easy access inputs for your VR
device learn more at the link in the
video description before you do anything
it is vital to make sure that your parts
are compatible in terms of both size and
power make sure that your case is large
enough to accommodate your graphics card
particularly if you're going with a
higher-end model and that you have a
power supply that has both the right
connections and can put out enough watts
virtually all graphics cards these days
use a 6 pin or 6 + 2 pin PCI Express
power connector which looks like this
some cards might only have one connector
while others will have two or even more
so verify that your PSU has the right
cables before you pull the trigger as
far as wattage goes most 500 to 600 watt
power supplies from reputable companies
can handle one graphics card with no
issues but if you'll be running more
graphics cards like two or three you
might need to look into something more
target reviews to see how much your card
actually needs sometimes power
requirements on spec sheets are vastly
overestimated so don't be too
disheartened if you only have something
like a 450 watt power supply as it may
end up working just fine as long as it's
a good one there's a great thread on the
Linus tech tips forum that covers which
makes and models are considered good you
can check that out in the link of the
description down below so let's get
right to it and remember to be careful
when handling computer components either
use an anti-static wristband or the
easier method of just touching a metal
part of your case from time to time
especially after moving your feet to
avoid damaging stuff with static
electric
city first decide where on your
motherboard your card is going to go
modern graphics cards can go on a PCI
Express x16 slot which are the longest
ones on your motherboard in the
expansion slot area generally it's a
good idea to install the card in the
topmost slot that is closest to the CPU
to ensure you're running it at full
speed but check your motherboard manual
to confirm its best use whatever slot
your manual shows as being 16x but using
an 8 X slot will work fine as well you
may not be able to avoid this if you're
using multiple cards like SLI or
crossfire and that's ok most cases will
have bracket covers for unused expansion
slots unscrew and remove the covers that
correspond with where your card needs to
go and then line up the bottom of the
card with the slot
I recommend holding it by the cooler and
avoiding touching the sensitive contacts
on the bottom or the traces on the back
the slot is keyed so it's impossible to
insert the card backwards so don't worry
about that push down with a firm but
steady pressure on each end of the card
until you hear an audible click
also notice that once the card is in the
retention clip at the end of the slot
will help hold it in place some other
words have clips that you have to
squeeze or push sideways on to release
the card with others you can just push
the clip down be sure to release the
clip if you ever need to remove the card
otherwise you could really damage both
the card and the board if you try to rip
it out once you've got your card in the
slot screw it into the case being sure
to lift the card a bit as you screw it
in so it won't droop later on then find
the PCI Express cables attached to your
power supply and plug them into the card
usually the connectors will be around
the cards right hand corner and are
keyed to keep you from installing them
upside down route your cable up to the
card preferably using the cable
management holes of your case that is
hopefully there and just push the cable
in until it clips into place so that's
it for the hardware install now it's
time to install drivers even if you were
not using a standalone graphics card
before I strongly recommend using the
free display driver on installer also
known as ddu a favorite program of ours
here at the office to completely remove
any remnants of old drivers from your
system first as they can
cause issues later if not properly
removed just run the program which will
automatically boot into safe mode select
whether you want to remove nvidia AMD or
intel drivers and reboot this is a good
idea even if you just built a new system
as Windows will often install display
drivers that are out of date once you
get back into windows head - either in
video or AMD's website entering your GPU
model and operating system and snag the
latest drivers don't bother using either
the driver disk that came with your card
or any drivers from Windows Update as
these tend to be out of date by the time
you actually install your card run the
installation program and select custom
installation to tell the system whether
you want drivers only or if you want any
additional software from Nvidia or AMD
wait for it to finish and you're all
done open up your games
crank up the settings and do your thing
