normally show you guys some cool
affordable tech stuff you can buy is
going to be a little different this time
around all the items will be priced at
over a hundred dollars and none of them
are going to be useful so we're going to
kick things off then with the Apple
watch which I'm just kidding it's the
usual thing
Corsairs RMI series power supplies
feature premium components for great
performance with very low noise check
out the link in the video description to
learn more let's jump right into it no
foreplay the first item for today is the
kind of thing that I'd recommend
ordering now and then putting away in a
drawer somewhere for that day when
you're running around trying to find a
freaking notebook power cord and all you
can find is the full-size PC ones
adapters like this are available in the
$5 range with shipping included if you
have a prime account and can adapt from
a variety of different power standards
with some going as far as to also
include a short cord so they can act as
an extension now I'm aware that you can
also just buy a bunch of c-5 power cords
I did but a handful of adapters is
lighter and more compact to take with
you in a tech tool kit where you'll
already be carrying a c14 cord or two
our next item is one that i've wanted to
make a video about since I did this
unboxing of the Razer Ouroboros in my
kitchen back in 2012 and was blown away
by the space-age material that they put
on the base station so I finally got
around to getting my hands on some this
pack from material sample shop comm
includes three a4 size sheets of the
material in point three point five and
point eight millimeter thickness
depending on what you want to use it for
the basic idea is pretty simple
you peel the adhesive on the one side
stick it to the thing that you want to
mount to something or hold in place and
slap it down the way it works is this
material is covered in thousands of tiny
suction cups so the flatter the two
mating surfaces are and the more contact
area they have the better it can be used
to mount pictures to flat relatively
glossy walls or Windows stick guitar
picks to your guitar create DIY seals or
gaskets and even hold docks in place
much like razer did with the Ouroboros
the sky is pretty much the limit it is a
bit expensive but when it gets dusty and
cruddy eventually you just wipe it with
a damp cloth let it dry out and
whoops it's good to go I love this stuff
finally my USB charging hub doesn't need
to fall off my nightstand every night
dragging my phone down with it next up
is the Yubikey a two-factor
authentication device that improves the
ease security and convenience of
managing your online accounts at least
once you go through the gauntlet of
getting everything configured the
Yubikey itself is pretty straightforward
it's a thin USB device about half the
width of a port with a touch sensitive
button and an NFC radio for use with NFC
enabled Android smartphones but where it
gets a bit complicated is in the
configuration the tools and guides use a
lot of acronyms and technical jargon
with half a dozen different Windows
applications for configuring settings
and functionality on the Yubikey site
depending on what you're trying to do
something you may not realize until
you've already downloaded it the good
news is that for my purposes using it as
an additional authentication factor you
can learn more about multi-factor
authentication here with LastPass and
using it as a windows login key is a
pretty basic config with everything in
the personalization tool the one that
you want to use pretty much left as
default and then a quick edit within
LastPass to get it set up so the
Achilles heel of the Yubikey
is also its greatest strength though
because as complicated as it might be
for new users it is extraordinarily
configurable if you want to dive into it
so you can make it so the physical key
is enough to authenticate you can force
the user to touch it no fingerprint ID
yet unfortunately but I'd be surprised
if that's not coming and you can force
the user to have both a UB key and a
password but don't worry it has backup
and restore settings in case you somehow
manage to damage it or lose your
keychain or whatever else for our next
trick yes this episode of Handy Tech has
more than three items we've got the ass
probe excuse me the amp probe battery
tester it's a simple little gadget that
tells you how much life is left if any
in your batteries it works with all the
usual 1.5 volt varieties triple a double
a CD and with nine volts as well and
while it really doesn't do anything you
couldn't do on your own with a
multimeter it's
easier to use and presents the results
in a way that my sister or my mom could
understand and while I might personally
really wish that it would tell me the
actual voltage instead of just good or
replace I can help you guys out by
interpreting it for you replace is in
the 1.3 volt range and if the needle
bounces off the end you're sitting at
about one point six volts now frankly I
don't know if this is the best such
device on the market but it sure helped
me sort the batteries in the office into
new still good remote control duty and
recycle so I consider it a winner
especially for the price and finally
we've got the Xbox one wireless adapter
controller dongle this time I am not
recommending a cheapo third-party one
they can be a nightmare to find software
drivers for and I actually have one died
last time around and when I ended up
replacing it I realized well now I've
spent so much I could have just bought a
first-party one anyway and besides at
this stage in the game Microsoft has the
only one that's compatible with Xbox one
controllers anyhow it supports up to
eight controllers now twice as many as
before for you know all those PC games
that support eight-way multiplayer and
works with the standard Xbox one
controller as well as the fancy-pants
elite controller that Luke reviewed here
but it does not work with Xbox 360
controllers for that you will still need
one of the last generation dongles cool
device for sure but it does come with
some caveats for some reason we're not
quite sure why
Microsoft has decided to use the
wireless adapter as a way to force users
to upgrade to Windows 10 and has refused
to provide a software driver for Windows
7 or 8 or 8.1 users so beware of that
which I guess concludes handy tech
episode 10 except from my usual
disclosure section which is pretty
simple today because all of the items in
today's episode were purchased by me
from Amazon and material sample shop
comm for use at home or around the
office with no prior contact with any of
the manufacturers which ties in nicely
then to my usual reminder that while I
frankly don't care if you buy any of
these items if you guys are shopping at
Amazon for the holiday season or
or any other reason hey check out the
guide up here for how to change your
Amazon bookmarked one with our affiliate
code so when you do shop there we get a
small kickback it helps us out a lot and
you know what else helps us out a lot
today's sponsor Lisa an innovative and
disruptive online mattress company and
you might be thinking yourself ok well
hold on a second mattresses online it's
actually not that crazy they describe
themselves as kind of like the TOMS
shoes or Warby Parker for mattresses for
every 10 mattresses they sell they
donate one to a shelter and they've done
away with all of that awkward mattress
showroom experience that we've all
suffered through at least I have where
you're like you're like laying on the
mattress next to your wife and you're
just you're kind of like you're standing
there watching us this isn't actually
how we normally sleep like you normally
her head would be on my shoulder or
somewhere else or whatever and yeah so
this feels really weird so they've taken
all that away if you order it online
they ship it for free to your doorstep
compressed in a box about the size of a
mini-fridge the mattress comes in all
sizes and is crafted from three unique
foam layers including two of memory foam
and two of a really cool latex like foam
called Avena that helps keep you cool
the best part is that while the awkward
showroom mattress experience kind of
sucks at least it gives you the
opportunity to try it before you commit
to spend a bunch of money well Lisa's
got you covered on that too you have 100
nights to try your mattress risk-free
and they start at five hundred and
twenty five bucks and as I mentioned
before shipping is free but there's more
the first 100 viewers link in the video
description to redeem promo code line is

order so check that out alright guys
