we have a working bathroom now oh really
yeah check it what wait hold are you
flinging in the bathroom that's wrong
with you
wow that's a big door that picks up the
hole all the way when you over look at
that
Intel's bringing ddr4 to the mainstream
with their all-new core i7 6700 K and
Core i5 6600 K processors check out the
link in the video description to learn
more ah so the six in the line for the
water that comes out of the fridge is
also in the library has a door now it
opens both ways check this up motion
sensing we got the prison windows and
yeah yeah so this is what it's like to
be locked up in the big house whoo these
are the monitors for the ending
workstations so 2 4 6 8 10 12 LG 31 mu
97 4k that is legit 4k so these are desk
card where it's also moving in here
apparently we can have the infection
with some little Harbor bleed in here so
that's good stuff
uh we've got our lower mounted power
outlets installed now we believe these
are also floor mounted Ethernet at some
point upstairs bathroom
okay so this is kind of a funny story
the problem is that and I didn't realize
this that bowl is too round for office
use it must be an elongated to Bowl
overboard Oh Morgan has made some
serious progress that's weird
um okay I super didn't think that's
where that power outlet was gonna go so
what is it doing up there I don't know I
thought the power out that was supposed
to be a lot closer to the middle of the
room well we have on the floor well yeah
but this is for the ceiling mounted
projector oh the planet has also changed
we will not be building this up into a
bench anymore we're actually going to
have kind of a uniquely shaped table for
the room so it's gonna have like kind of
a wavy figure-eight type shape blue
windows
apparently this is where we store all
our lights finally that train get used
to that
cuz uh pretty much all warehouse
property is next to the train tracks
here so you might hear that in our
videos sometimes it's kind of a cool
view from up here
oh sweet the Chocolate bugs
berkel you should draw something
offensive on the chalkboard okay I can
tell you how linus got in there he
basically put a ladder up watching look
there's no way Luke will get up there
who closed the door off automatically or
did you unlock the door like did you go
I unlocked the door
why the hell would they close it wait
but they cleaned it carbine if I just
can't get in there to do that the copper
like I unlocked it already this morning
that you probably already observed me
doing and somehow the carpet cleaner who
fortunately got anything the carpet
first managed to lock it again so I'm
going to have to repeat my amazing feat
what are you doing there
Nick uploading a long waited video is
that the dildo racing with that oh boy
it's a child stop yes why are they here
are they at least a pair yeah
right and I did well John that magical
radiator is going on seven now what I am
NOT going to mount this over here if you
film anything without getting in the way
well no there's no space and I found
this you've been looking for this
forever
I can finally return that slate that you
brought into work you have to use to you
and is that really yours should be a
slave neo hyper what happened to it it's
in such great condition because we took
some what happened doing Lynas happened
to it
okay so he would write something down
and go okay okay so I just got off the
phone with Luke
he's done the script for the g29 wheel
video so we need to set up to film but
it's okay because I have a brilliant
idea we'll set up the green screen we'll
take some stock footage of the old
kitchen and we will green screen the
kitchen No
are you serious yes
you hurt my brain all right let's do it
friend where do you think we should set
up the green screen I don't know all the
way upstairs in the unfinished office
wow this is like a super patio stick
around this looks like the kind of RAM
people back from where I'm from wood
using their pcs
you know one of the things that I keep
asking people to do and I think people
have done a good job of it is actually
keep the scissors
Michelle but I need a shelf all to
myself
Patel you Sam you know how you sound
every time anyone asks you to do
anything oh I need you to tell me the
specific thing on a specific day at the
specific second in the specific place
and who said it
oh and why I don't do that yes you do
hey Buerkle I need a strapping strong
man so can you send Denis or Taryn over
are we looking from the bottom we have
this stupid thing Wow oh is it totally
leaking is it is it living is it just
still don't always watched over waste as
much as everyone um you know that yeah
keep that camera rolling because if we
spill this and it's amazing I want to at
least have a video to show for it if I
died on a video can you guys still
upload it I don't know it depends how
super five minutes we have to consult a
lawyer first
who doesn't have him on camera telling
us that it's okay
okay that is heavy
loot from the fridge yeah who brought
these hello jeez bogey on the back of
the fridge we are just in the fridge ah
this episode brought to you by snap
everything else in there I don't care
San Pellegrino Snapple angry
whose freedom help me set up the green I
can't help you we have to shoot a video
that's a green screen it is pretty
sketchy
it feels way too sketchy when you're
standing here so what are we doing
Brendon hovering the windows don't put
that in the video I'm putting that no
Joe no that's so unprofessional this is
gonna be a tricky you'd like to read
yourself with bins over here neck you
know because I'm trying to be efficient
with a bin master this janky setup is
not what I'm going to do as a final
setup for when we actually set up the
green screen but it's what I've got now
in the time that I have because we got
to have this done and edited today we've
yet to edit this video today yes why
because reasons that's oh yeah like 30
minutes left I'm so tired
just taking a break down the stairs here
it's really hot in the office
I mean warehouse oh you are the worst
person in the world so this is today's
YouTube video and looks like it yeah
it's exporting try it it's really good
that's right don't do it don't throw it
you catch it don't throw it Vanna
coalition I told you I can't catch
anything I don't want this you've been
sucking on it you have to edit this
today um what would you like me to say
I'd like you to say no come back
tomorrow and it's cool and everything is
great I don't think that's the answer
you know what this warehouse needs more
like aerial footage of all the cool crap
going on in here
if only I could think of some site where
you could get a drone more affordably if
a bunch of people agreed to buy one owns
it right master ah that's the way that
site works the more people agree to buy
the more people commit the lower the
price goes down
to a limit so you guys should head over
to drawed ups slash Linus tech tips
because the deal right now is for a DJI
phantom advance they've got all kinds of
great stuff there and I went to grab my
trusty knife that I usually keep in my
pocket that is actually was a mass drop
item as well but I didn't have it on me
so you'll have to take my word for it
they've got knives they've got computer
stuff like keyboards they've got
professional audio gear they've got
headphones all kinds of great stuff and
it's all like through the correct
channels mast drops works with their
community to find the deals that they
want and then works with the
manufacturers and distributors to make
sure that they're getting genuine
product with a warranty and all of that
good stuff nothing shady about it just a
better deal so head over to draw drops
slash Linus tech tips to join mass drop
today all right so it's the end of day
four and even though we can't
strictly speaking move in because we
don't have our final inspection you can
see that we've definitely made it our
own in in some ways we've gone our kind
of whatever this is island of inventory
control we're actually almost on
inventory and this is a proud moment for
