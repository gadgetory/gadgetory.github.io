to get bored because whenever I feel
like coming on all I need to do is fire
up a web browser and then descend into
what I call a related products black
hole until I find something so
mind-bendingly weird or stupid that I
know that I simply must have one so I
can try it out and share it with you
guys and because my websites of choice
for these descents are ones like Taobao
Aliexpress steel extreme and eBay it is
usually quite affordable and doesn't
take that long so without further ado I
present to you my latest find the ddr4
memory to end onto SSD drive adapter how
does it work well I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say probably not the way that
you'd expect but I'm sure what you were
expecting was this segue to our sponsor
glassware with glass wire you can
instantly see your current and past
Network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device
use offer code Linus and get 25% off
glass wire at the link below
okay so what we've got here if the
product name is anything to go by is a
ddr2 NDOT to hard disk adapter card say
to the m dot 2 ND FF b key memory slot
SSD expansion card so what I gather from
all of that is that we are adapting a
ddr4 memory slot to an end dot 2 SSD
drive slot so I guess we should probably
go get one of each of those things and
give this a shot shall we okay so we've
got our test bench we've got our m2 SSD
and we've got our bizarre adapter so I'm
gonna go ahead and pull out one of my
memory sticks here and actually before
we put this in let's let's install an
SSD on it so they helpfully include this
screw driver oh oh we seem to have a
slight problem here houston this does
not fit in how about if we try it the
other way no what kind of looks like
it'll go in that still doesn't work so
what could be the problem here
I mean other than that this is
completely insane alright so we've
missed something here we did a bit of an
explainer on this a while back but I
don't blame me for not watching it it
was kind of boring but m dot 2 is just a
physical slot and it can actually accept
drives that use both the newer nvme
protocol and the older SATA type drives
so what we need is a SATA m dot to drive
with the correct keying for this type of
slot so now that we're equipped with
that let's try again shall we so here's
our WD blue you can see that aha
indeed this does install now
go ahead and grab our screws oh look at
that our free screwdriver easy fellow
it's even magnetic not very magnetic
mind you just a little magnetic okay so
there it is feels a little like complete
madness and maybe it is but hey isn't
that why we're all here let's fire it up
shall we
oh it's actually my first time using my
test bench in the new office I need to
turn on my UPS I need to plug in my UPS
hey there we go all right all right you
crazy little adapter show me your magic
reveal to me your secrets okay so as
we'd expect we're down to 24 gigs of RAM
because we did remove one of our 8 gig
sticks and as far as our storage drives
go we've got a whole lot of nothing
going on here
perhaps then that's why they included
this I think it was supposed to be red
but it actually ended up kind of pink
didn't it ah SATA cable in the package
so let's shut her down and plug this
baby in okay so now that we're just
using a SATA cable we'd expect it to
show up as a normal say to drive but the
thing is there's still nothing nada all
right so here's the thing there are
actually a lot of different ways that an
adapter can function so you know how if
you buy a travel adapter for your
electronic devices there are the bulky
ones that actually convert from 220
volts to 110 volts versus the simple
ones that just physically change the
shape of the prongs on your device to
fit into another socket
well those rely on the user to double
check if their device has a universal
input switching power supply kind of
like
this one so the same kind of rules apply
for computer adapters and there are a
number of different main kinds the first
one is what I call physical adapters and
these are very simple actually here I
can grab one right now this right here
is a USB type a 2 USB micro-b adapter
cable and while microbead does actually
this is fun fact have an extra conductor
in the tip it's only for sensing if a
device that would normally be the target
is supposed to act as a host so this
functionality was built for USB
on-the-go or OTG and allowed you to plug
accessories like network cards into
devices like phones and tablets for the
vast majority of use cases though that
extra pin lies dormant and all this
Cable does is run the same for
conductors power ground and then to data
wires to two different shaped plugs no
modifications to the signal whatsoever
are actually taking place the second
main kind of adapter is a little bit
more complicated I'm gonna call these
signal mode adapters for lack of a
better term these take some connector
and convert it into another one that is
totally different but natively supported
these types of adapters tend to be
relatively inexpensive still thanks to
the fact that the processing is being
done on the computer or the device side
the last main adapter I'm going to talk
about is what I will call a complete
adapter these take an entirely unrelated
signal and then actively convert it test
something else in real time an example
of this would be something like an HDMI
to VGA adapter HDMI has no legacy analog
mode of operation and a VGA display
device has zero understanding whatsoever
of digital signaling so these types of
adapters tend to be more expensive due
to the required processing power like
there will be chips inside they tend to
be
here for the same reason and they also
tend to be directional only working one
way so this one will take the HDMI port
on your laptop and convert it to a VGA
cable for that projector in the old
conference room but it would not go the
other way around it's also common for
these to require an external power
source in order to function depending on
what type of connection is being
converted and whether it has power pins
that can be utilized so back to the
topic at hand then this device was far
less interesting than I had initially
hoped right after I clicked on it the
geek in me would have absolutely loved
to see some kind of you know crazy way
to use a high-speed memory interface
with a standard SSD the issue is that
such a product would have to have been
designed from the ground up for that
type of access like intel's octane dims
that they actually I think just finally
started releasing because a normal
computer would have no idea what to do
with a storage device plugged into a
memory slot the interfaces are
absolutely nothing alike once I accepted
that my pipe dream wasn't happening I
decided I would still be pretty happy
with having my drive powered by the
memory slot with only a SATA data cable
required in order to get it working
which is to say that I was pretty
disappointed when I figured out what was
actually going on here and I kind of
wondered why they bothered to mount this
thing on a dim at all because if you
look closely near the pins here you'll
actually see that none of them are
connected to any traces on the printed
circuit board which means that we're
pretty much just wasting the gold
plating on these connectors and we could
have just as easily double taped this
thing to the side of another component
or left it hanging off of the cables
making this I would say somewhere in
between a type 1 and
type 2 adapter because we're pretty much
just taking these pins and converting
them it looks like we're doing a little
bit of something to it to these pins
over here the good news is that once
it's all hooked up correctly our drive
does indeed show up here's our 500 gig
drive and we can probably even boot to
it so MDOT to say to folks there it is
I'm just a little disappointed because I
had hoped there was a little bit more
exotic technology going on and this is
pretty much just a simple physical
adapter well our sponsor for today's
video is mast rod featuring the master
optics Bayer dynamic DT 177 X go
headphones so Bayer dynamic if you're
not familiar with them is a
world-renowned German manufacturer and
these ones feature a closed back design
their latest generation of 45 millimeter
Tesla drivers a wide frequency range and
weighty controlled bass they're our
favorite for recording studios and their
32 ohm impedance mean that they're easy
to drive from portable sources without
an amp they feature a durable design
with aluminum ear cups a spring steel
headband and metal yokes and hinges and
