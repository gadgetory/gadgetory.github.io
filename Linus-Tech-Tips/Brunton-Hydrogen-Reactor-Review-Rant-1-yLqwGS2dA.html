even though I purchased it myself from
B&amp;amp;H with the intention of publishing a
review from a normal users perspective I
was so appalled by the Brenton hydrogen
reactor that I contacted them anyway and
spoke to customer support and the
product manager who assured me the
design was fine and there might be
something wrong with my unit
he said he'd exchanged my unit for a new
one and since then I've waited over a
month during which time I've sent four
requests for the new unit they haven't
replied and all I can do now is assume
they don't think sending a new one will
help so without further ado here's my
video the cooler master glazier 240 L
CPU cooler delivers the convenience of
an all-in-one and the performance of a
custom water cooler click now to learn
more welcome to my unboxing of a product
that many people are curious about and
no one seems to know much about not even
the manufacturer the page about it
linked from the Brunton home page seems
designed to give as little information
as possible with only a promotional
video designed to appeal to outdoorsy
environmentalists I mean I guess the
video also shows using it in the snow
and rain and stuff and says that you can
abuse the product and they'll cover it
under warranty so that's cool but I wish
it also said to be careful because the
exposed plugged in USB connectors in a
wet environment that they show in the
video are not a great idea and even if
your hydrogen reactor is covered your
phone or whatever else is plugged into
it is not we find more information on
the page within the store a particular
interest here is the fact that you can
live swap the cells when one runs out
for continuous power a very neat feature
the benefits listed on the store are
that it's environmentally responsible it
recharges with water and a hydrolyzed ER
and then outputs only water when in use
it has no bulky batteries but a bulky
reactor to carry and these things so I
don't know no solar power to rely on and
no natural discharge which is a definite
issue with regular rechargeable
batteries even Anna loops this last
selling point is a potentially important
feature for something like an emergency
preparedness kit so these are Hydra
they store hydrogen by absorbing the gas
into reversible metal hydride this means
the solid-state storage and less
volatility compared to straight
compressed gas you can even take up to
two of them on an airplane with you in
terms of size that are about equivalent
to four to five double-a batteries with
the optional hydrolyzed ER accessory
that can be recharged up to a hundred
times I was actually looking for extra
information about the hydro cores and I
came across horizons website they seem
to be the actual manufacturer of a
similar product called the mini pack and
similar hydrogen cartridges called hydro
sticks which Brunton has refined branded
and brought to market a fairly common
occurrence
unfortunately because it's not a
straight real label the ODMs website
really didn't help me as much as I hoped
and ended up just being yet another
source of conflict information on the
phone when I asked Brenton directly I
was told a Hydra core is about
equivalent to a four thousand milliamp
hour battery bank but good luck finding
that information anywhere public on the
Brunton site and product box instead
they rate it in iphone recharges derp
okay so it's rated at six iphone
recharges but then horizon site says two
iphone recharges which is more in line
with the four thousand milliamp hours
that I was told on the phone then
they've got double a battery
equivalencies that are used on both
websites instead of standardized
measurements these also frustrated me as
I continued to dig on the Brunton box it
claims that a hydro core is equal to 15
plus double-a batteries but horizons
Hydra stick has both 14 and 10 battery
equivalencies on the exact same page
literally 6 inches from each other
lastly and this is important Brunton
claims hydro cores will handle a 2 amp
output and horizon rates their hydro
sticks at 0.4 amps I was a shirt on the
phone that the higher amperage output is
one of the benefits over the horizon
design of the Brunton one and you just
press this button on the top to kick it
into high gear to enable to amp output
at the end of it all I really wasn't
sure how to interpret everything but one
theory I had at first was that Brunton
could be using the
refined Hydra stick Pro that was teased
on horizons Facebook page months ago but
then never released under their own name
after testing I'm not so sure but for
now let's move on to using it I didn't
realize this when buying it but it's
actually basically useless without the
250 dollar recharge station the two
included Hydra course will be empty
after anywhere from four to twelve
iPhone cellphone charges and then you
can either buy more of them for twenty
bucks a pop if you can even find them I
couldn't find anywhere to buy them or
get a recharge station for 250 dollars I
assumed that the reactor itself would
come with that functionality for a
hundred and fifty dollars
guess I should have done more research
so basically at this point a product
that is supposed to reduce bulk compared
to battery banks has me carrying fuel
cells a reactor a recharge station and
then something to power the recharge
station with if I'm going to be
somewhere for longer than a couple of
days brilliant anyway you load the fuel
cell in by screed in wait for the light
to stop flashing then it's ready to rock
the purge valve does a self-test to
during the startup process don't be
alarmed it's just a little this knows
it's not a big deal in operation the
reactor gets warm to the touch but not
hot the hydro core fuel cell on the
other hand does not it stays cool to the
touch
noticeably damp air comes off the
sidewall to operator which makes sense
because it does exhaust water but
there's no real visible steam and it
does kind of smell funny but I wasn't
sure if that was only because it's new
or whether it will continue to do that
throughout its lifetime I mean all
that's fine and good but as long as it
charges your devices then a device
charger can be determined to be
functional well honestly once it got
going and booted up it just plain didn't
do that either my HTC one picked up the
power source but said it was
insufficient for charging and my iPad
Mini has a nice little helpful not
charging icon in the top corner so it
sounds like that point four amp rating
on horizon site is probably closer to
reality than the 2 amp one that
Brenton's advertising on their site in
spite of the fact that right here on the
side of the box it says one amp so out
and when it in order to validate these
results since I didn't get another unit
I checked out reviews on their website
what few of those reviews aren't just
pre-sales questions from people who
don't actually own the thing with
responses from brundin employees that
are then rated 5 stars did seem to back
this up mine doesn't charge a tablet or
even a high powered smartphone and that
seemed consistent with the experience
that the only other verified owners I
can find are having I also really have
to question the claim of reduced bulk
and weight in their video compared to
batteries to Hydra cores in a reactor
you will need one of these for the other
stuff to be useful at all weigh all
together around 365 grams or about the
same as a 12,000 milliamp hour battery
pack from into circuit which you can get
for about 50 bucks on Amazon in addition
to that they are much smaller they're
not as versatile in terms of output
voltage and the devices they can power
and they don't have as much capacity
compared to that into circuit solution
this whole apparatus also weighs about
the same as to Patriot fuel plus 9
thousand milliamp hour portable battery
banks these are $72 each firm Patriot
and they stomp all over the Brunton
hydrogen reactor in terms of capacity
they have two and a half m outputs for
faster charging they're similar overall
size not to mention that with regular
portable battery packs there's no water
vapor exhaust you don't need to keep
them in a particular orientation there's
no boot up time they have more output
ports I don't know if I mentioned that
already and they're easy to obtain at a
local store whereas more fuel cells will
need to be ordered online if you can
find them at all and finally they don't
need an expensive charging station so
basically unless you're an early adopter
for fun I don't recommend this product
okay it's green and hydro cores are
recyclable as tin but it just doesn't
make any sense it's meat
to see fuel cell technology being
deployed for consumers even if the
initial product offerings are
unexceptional expensive and difficult to
obtain but for me to re-examine this
technology in the future functionality
will have to be improved and pricing
will have to come down quite a bit
speaking of price
from browsing Brunton's website it looks
like they are taking some pretty sweet
profit on their products in general
their equivalent to the into circuit
twelve thousand million power charger is
called the Impella - and comes with a
rugged casing and costs four hundred
dollars that is eight times as much for
that rugged casing you might as well
just buy eight of the other one so maybe
what it will take is another brand to
bring fuel cell products to market and
we'll get a result that makes a bit more
sense for the average consumer don't
