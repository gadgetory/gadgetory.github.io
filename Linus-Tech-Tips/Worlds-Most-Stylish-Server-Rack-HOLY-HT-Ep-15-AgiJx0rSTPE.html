a fans or construction equipment and
that the only people there winning any
style points with are the folks who have
this like deep appreciation for utility
that's the way it's always been
and that's the way that it looked like
it was going to be forever until now
clay tech a division of AI star USA with
whom we've worked in the past on our
surveillance server our pfsense router
that we DIY over a span of months as
well as our off-site backup server has
actually designed and manufactured a
piece of what they're calling IT
furniture the wrt retro style rack so
let's have a look and see what one of
those is
so Tax GT X 1080 mini is extremely
compact and powerful measuring just 8.3
inches in length check it out at the
link in the video description I actually
have no idea how much these things cost
I have no idea how many of them have
been made they are listed as build to
order on the clay tax site but what I do
know is that like for a company whose
experience is mostly in building black
nondescript boxes the craftsmanship is
looking not that all right Brandon you
win your battle it looks like we're
taking this tablecloth off fine it is oh
man heavy
very well packed that's for sure so
they've actually got a bunch of
different models available everything
from a very very small very shallow
cabinet all the way to one that's
actually quite a bit larger and deeper
than this one so I went free 9u four
hundred and fifty millimeters so that's
45 centimeter deep cabinet so obviously
something like this wouldn't be suitable
for mounting you know like like a really
long storage server or anything like
that but if you're looking for a super
cool place to put some AV equipment or
you know some network switches or you
know a very very small machine this is
looking pretty good flip it over so I've
clearly got it upside down okay so the
craftsmanship is not perfect you know
Steve Jobs you know
cable managed the inside of you know
laptops and phones probably wouldn't be
that impressed with the the wood trim
not meeting up here and with these kind
of unimpressive plastic feet but let's
go ahead and turn it over and see what
the tops like maybe it's up for it in
the part that you actually see so much
like a sort of retro styled trunk or
case you've got this actual leather
actually leather I mean I guess it's one
of those things where if you're going to
go our word you might as well go full
full our word so the handles on the
sides the corner protectors here and
here are all genuine leather now ah
let's put some gear in it shall we
about a half an hour till when show so
I'm thinking let's put all of our audio
equipment in it what could go wrong
focus right just set us up with this
stuff and this is up this is exactly the
kind of thing that I would expect
someone to put in a piece of you know
rack equipment like this remember kids
always take a picture of the back before
disassembling something that you don't
know how to put back together
it's m5 threaded rather than having like
what you'd see in a full-size cabinet
with the inserts on the back and the
much heavier threading so I really
wouldn't recommend mounting anything
super-heavy in here but that once you
get some actual gearing here I don't
know what it is about the aesthetic of
like audio equipment and this retro kind
of charm that we got going on here but I
think this thing looks really cool
actually I had a fought I've got this
chassis sitting around from the actually
it's a nice car USA chassis that I was
supposed to do a project with I never
got around to it and it looks like no
that was a bit of an oversight when it
comes to the design of this thing one
two three one two three one two three
one two three yeah so if they had
thought of it they could have made it so
that the bottom holes lined up perfectly
for something to sit right on the bottom
but as it
you would actually have to support it
off of these screws which I don't think
would be recommended however if you did
just want to like get on out it then you
could throw some kind of a storage
machine or some kind of a processing
machine down here on the bottom no big
deal okay I got a couple more things I
got a network switch and our old I
scuzzy locks here just to fill it up
have a look at that can look like and uh
ah yeah see this one this network switch
is pretty heavy there you go
ah tied down how whatever yeah that line
this guy what does he know about rack
mounting things that looks so cool I
love it it's like frickin amazing it's
like on the one side blank old-fashioned
retro and the other side it's like oh my
goodness look at all these dials and
buttons but now the final benchmark
those leather handles how do they hold
up to it actually being loaded oh okay
hold on you're not going heavy side
heavy side on my side okay hold on
have you ever thought to yourself hmm
what would it be like if I wanted to
talk to my you know mobile carrier and I
called them up and just got put through
directly to someone who's ready to talk
to me well then you probably use ting
because that's exactly what happens ting
is all about customer satisfaction first
you call in you talk to a person and you
pay for only what you use with the
average ting bill being only 23 bucks a
month
they've got lower mobile data rates
across the board just $10 per gig beyond
the first gig and they'll cover 25% of
your cancellation fee from your existing
plan up to 75 bucks pretty cool so head
over to Linus King calm and try out
their savings calculator to see if
you'll save by switching to ting then
when you use our link you can get 25
bucks towards a new device or in service
credit whew Linus King calm
you're not even rich oh okay so the
handles are holding up fine but I don't
think I can move it on my own anymore so
