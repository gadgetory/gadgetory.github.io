available for a while now
but the founders edition version that we
reviewed back when they launched has all
but disappeared from the market at this
point and while finding a non reference
card can also be difficult
looking at this gigabyte one for
instance it's out of stock at newegg.com
and in low stock on Amazon at least you
can get them so how do they compare to
the founders edition cards and how do
they stack up against the competition on
AMD's side let's find out freshbooks is
the super simple invoicing solution that
lets you get organized save time and get
paid faster click now to try for free
starting with the physical hardware that
gigabyte has strapped on this gtx 1060
g1 gaming 6 gigabyte edition card it
comes with dual windforce 90 millimeter
fans which have striped blades and
unique curves that claim they will
increase airflow by 23% when they spin
of fanless mode is included along with a
bright don't worry I'm not dead led
unusually however they spin in different
directions seriously if you look at the
card without the fan spinning you'll see
that the left fan scoops to the left and
the right fan scoops to the right
theoretically this results in a
reduction of air turbulence as they both
push air out the top of the card
together does it feel like to anyone
else that every year there's some new
way to just put fans on a graphics card
the heatsink they sit on features to
direct touch copper heat pipes which
also claim a vague 29 percent
improvement bringing us to the real
results a pretty impressive 61 degrees
Celsius in a room temperature of about
25 degrees all while the card was
pushing our crysis 3 skybox their test
and running at nineteen hundred and
eighty seven megahertz which is 140
megahertz above the advertised boost
clock okay that's actually pretty sweet
but who cares about speed where's the
RGB lighting never fear the a fermented
fan stop LED is actually RGB along with
the gigabyte logo just to
left of it but while the decision to
include this was great in all it does
feel a little odd when paired with the
striking orange accents on the card
itself yes these are near the fans and
therefore will be out of sight in most
cases but it feels like they were kind
of a oversight in regards to power the
g1 comes with a six plus one power phase
design compared to the reference three
plus one setup and it has this cool
smart LED indicator I've seen power
cable indicators in the past that just
illuminate if you have a cable plugged
in this one however flashes if there's
an issue with your power supply or
illuminates if the cable is unplugged
which makes more sense to me for output
it comes with a standard setup for a gtx
1060 which is one dual link DVI d1 hdmi
2.0 b and three DisplayPort 1.4
connectors which can support up to eight
K at sixty Hertz
although good luck gaming at that
resolution and now if you want to learn
more about the GP 106 chip that is
inside of this GPU check up here for our
launch video on the 1060 and skip to
about one minute and seven seconds if
you want to see our overview of the new
software features that were released
with the Pascal architecture like the
surprisingly interesting screenshot tool
named Ansel and some new VR works
features check out this GT X 1080 review
and skip to about one minute and 50
seconds anyways let's move right on to
performance I tested gigabytes g1 gaming
1066 gigabyte against a reference
founders Edition six gigabyte card it's
bigger brother the gtx 1070 in an EVGA
superclocked variant and the main
competition from the other side the RX
480 unfortunately I couldn't test it
against the reason that I keep calling
it a 1066 gigabyte the recently released
Nvidia 3 gigabyte GTX 1060 Nvidia
surprised everyone with that and as we
don't have one of those in office yet I
was not able to do anything with it so
stay tuned for that it's able to push
well over 60 frames per second in every
title we test it with maximum presets at
1080p which NVIDIA has been pretty clear
as the target resolution for this card
and with those settings everything
looked nice and crispy and beat out it's
more expensive
owners edition cousin although it's not
too surprising as it ran about 127
megahertz faster went under load in our
Crysis 3 skybox tere test
thanks to GPU boost and it's better
cooler and board design the more
interesting story here is how it trades
blows with the R X 480 it wins by a
considerable amount in Crysis 3 and rise
of the Tomb Raider and surprisingly
manages a win in ashes of the
singularity as well but when we take a
look at doom and hitman there's a shift
in the balance for power for hitman the
Gigabyte 1060 wins in DirectX 11 but
loses in DirectX 12 despite both of them
gaining overall performance then moving
to doom Vulcan and asynchronous compute
being applied it's not even a fair
contest the R X 480 wins by a massive
20% so the story continues to be what it
has been invidious Pascal GPUs are fast
and gigabytes g1 gaming variant of the
1066 gigabyte card is a solid option
with great cooling and low noise floor
it even managed to stay relatively quiet
under heavy load but this seems to be
more of an architectural battle at this
point instead of the crazy aftermarket
cooler showdown that we saw with the 700
900 series it will be interesting to see
how each side holds up in about a year
as more and more games keep on coming
out with Vulcan and DirectX 12 support
and when AMD hopefully has some kind of
response to in videos higher end cards
do you hate weird privacy issues that
come along with traveling sitting on
open Wi-Fi networks at like Starbucks
and stuff maybe you should try tunnel
bear with tunnel bear turned on your
Wi-Fi connection is secured and your
online privacy is kept well private this
includes from your internet provider
advertisers hackers anyone looking to
track and/or profit from your data
tunnel there has a top rated privacy
policy and does not log your activity
which is good you can try for free with
500 megabytes and no credit card
required and if you choose to get a year
of unlimited data you can save 10% we're
going to tunnel bear comm /l tt
anyways guys thanks for watching hit
that like button if you liked it
subscribe all that kind of stuff if you
hated it hit the dislike button check
out this video to see our previous 10 60
video on the founders Edition that I
referenced earlier check the link to
view description down below to buy stuff
at Amazon or get a cool t-shirt that
isn't this one and I said that for the
first time while wearing Alliance tech
tips logoed shirt get rekt this is four
packs we're going there tomorrow so I'm
going to end the video now because I
think I said everything that I have to
