unboxings where basically I'm just
guessing the whole time because this is
something that we should have had ages
ago but it took until now for BenQ to
pull the trigger and develop this
product this is the e w 2420 this is an
LED backlit LCD monitor okay
none of that sounds very interesting yet
but I assure you we're getting there
we're getting there it is a 24 inch
monitor and I would love to get this
tape off see this is what happens when I
get distracted talking about the product
you know then I can't even open a box
all right there we go I'm just excited
sorry okay so I'll show you very little
until we actually have
this is a 1920 by 1080 monitor 1080p and
there goes the stand which I hope is
still okay and I still haven't given
away the secret yet of why this is so
interesting and why this is so exciting
well I'll tell you now because this is a
VA panel with an LED backlight so this
is pretty much the first legitimately
premium monitor that we've seen with an
LED backlight because LED backlighting
is is fine and good you know it it gives
you better color reproduction it gives
you better overall brightness it gives
you better energy efficiency it's a very
good thing but here we go the world's
first va LED monitor but VA gives you
better color reproduction a wide viewing
angle and a generally more pleasing
viewing experience so you combine those
two things together and all of a sudden
you've got just a crazy product now I
realize it doesn't look all that special
because the bezel design is quite
straightforward no it's just it's very
slick it's very functional you know it
doesn't have a lot of the bells and
whistles like height adjustable stand
swivel all that stuff but if what you're
looking for is a value priced LED
backlit VA panel monitor this is it it's
got a couple HDMI inputs so you've got
all the features that matter okay
there's like wow there's like so much
plastic on this thing I'm just going to
peel it all off so I can show you what
the product looks like here why don't
you just pause it for a second there so
I found this in the box I'm not quite
sure where it goes but we finally got
the monitor unplastered so we can show
you all the different accessories
comes with this little guy who appears
to be some kind of teddy bear it
obviously clips on to the monitor
somewhere but I can't I can't quite find
where it goes and I'm not gonna consider
myself to much with it comes with a
power cable comes with a USB a 2b cable
for the built-in 4 port USB hub you've
also got an audio cable because yes this
thing has everything it has all the
practical features so it has built-in
speakers you see them right there and we
can also see all of the inputs so I'm
just gonna lean over so that I can
actually point to all they live all the
relevant things so we've got our two
HDMI inputs one DVI input one VGA input
been ques only included a VGA cable with
this particular monitor so if you are
buying it make sure you grab a DVI cable
or an HDMI cable
there's your USB be in two USB ports
then moving on to the side of the
monitor we have two more USB ports and a
headphone jack that's cool too
because now all of a sudden you've got
your speaker's on your monitor you don't
want your speaker's you plug in your
headphones right in the side of your
monitor I actually haven't seen that
before so that's outstanding all of your
on-screen display controls are over here
on the right-hand side of the monitor so
I'm assuming oh yeah the labels are on
the front so you got your auto adjust
menu up down as well as enter or select
so that's the confirm button just want
to come around and have a look at the
back so it's quite slick looking
actually you got your glossy plastic
here which matches the front then you've
got kind of a leathered look on the
plastic right at the back you got your
four screw holes for the VESA mount so
if you wanted to arm mount this or
notice however it is that you want to do
it then that is where you would do that
here's a little cable management clip
alright and then there's a little piece
here that covers up a great part of the
stand and ok let's just go through sort
of the last thing so here's what they
have to say for themselves about it wide
viewing angle of truly authentic colors
as I said be a panel LED backlight the
best of every possible world then we've
got it true it's a true 8 bit panel so
once again that's more colour depth
better good 8 millisecond graded
response
very respectable but bear in mind then
DEA panels will never be as fast as TN
panels for a strictly gaming so if you
don't give two hoots about your image
quality and all you want is the fastest
possible panel then a VA panel is not
really the answer for you although
personally I would never compromise the
better image quality that you get from a
VA or an IPS panel versus a TN panel up
here we have 11 multimedia connections
which we've already had a look at and
dual 1.5 watt built-in speakers which
we've already looked at so this is a
very cool product I am very happy to
present it to you today and actually
here's another thing to talk about this
isn't quite a glossy screen it's kind of
it's kind of a hybrid it's not quite
flat but it's not quite that mirror
reflection glossy either and one of the
reasons those glossy screens showed up
in the first place and this is my
conjecture I don't know this for sure
but is because everyone was cheaping out
on the panels and laptops so they were
using cheapo TN panels so they were like
okay well how can I make the colors look
vibrant put a glossy screen on it there
you go
so really there are very very few high
quality panel monitors that use glossy
screens because it's not necessary
because they're capable of producing all
those colors all that vibrance all that
crispness on their own just fine so that
would be why doesn't have one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
