Revo drive x2 bootable PCIe solid-state
drive it uses an award-winning design
descent force driven it is powered by
PCI Express 4x and it uses internal raid
0 so now that I've read you all of the
information off the Box I am going to
open the package and then the box
basically this is an updated version and
a higher performance version of the
original Revo drive which was released
really not all that long ago but the
Revo drive x2 brings to the table over
the original Revo drive is more
performance as well as the capability
for higher capacities because of the way
it's designed it is also completely
bootable so all you do is throw it in a
PCI Express 4x or higher slot so it can
run in an 8 X or a 16 X slot a 4x blot
doesn't really matter you're just gonna
get more Bend or no you're not gonna get
more bandwidth if you ran it in a lower
slot like a PCIe 1x slot then you get
lower bandwidth but the 4x slot is the
optimal one and I'm not sure what I was
going with that my SSD is faster than
your hard drive sticker is included you
also get an installation and Quick Start
Guide all right and then since there are
no accessories we can presume that the
Revo drive functions with no accessories
and we would be correct
because unlike SSD normal SSD drives
hard drives pretty much anything else
that you plug into your computer the
Revo drive is entirely powered as well
as putting all of its data over the PCI
Express connector here at the bottom so
your power comes here your data goes
here that means you don't need any
external power adapters you don't need
any external data cables this is it this
is a 240 gig drive that is powered by 4
count them four stand force controllers
so each one of these SandForce chips
right here is controlling a bank of
flash so you can see there's also flash
chips on the back and then there's two
more send forth tips that are on that
so the Revo Drive x2 really is x2 it
uses two pcbs force and force
controllers running an internal raid
zero in order to get the blistering fast
performance speeds which I don't think
I've actually called out specifically so
the 240 gig and op are capable of reads
up to seven hundred and forty megabytes
per second and writes up to seven
hundred and twenty megabytes per second
let's flip it over and have a look at
the back so that's the RAID controller
chip right there actually so I believe
you can actually configure the drive in
something other than raid zero but it
comes pre-configured bootable in raid
zero for maximum performance so there's
your part number sticker on the back the
back pci plate has absolutely nothing on
it it's completely bare because that's
it you take this you throw it in the
slot boom you have a 240 gig bootable
raid zero drive so thank you for
checking out this unboxing and first
look at the OCZ
Revo drive x2 240 gig SSD don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech tips oh one
more thing
check this out cool so they've got the
drives actually labeled on here so this
is drive 0 this is drive 1 and
presumably drives 2 and 3 are also
labeled down there but I can't really
see ya there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
