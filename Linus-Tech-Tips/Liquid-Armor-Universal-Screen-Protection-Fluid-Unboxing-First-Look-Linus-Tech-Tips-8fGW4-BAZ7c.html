armor invisible nano-coating tech screen
protector for all tablets and e-readers
and I'm sure they mean smartphones as
well although I have two slightly
different looking boxes for smartphones
and tablets I'm fairly certain it's
probably the same thing inside so what
is this for
well I'll tell you guys right now like
first first and foremost is when I first
heard about this I was a little bit
skeptical and I still haven't had a
chance to try it in person so before we
go any further I want you guys to leave
comments on the video and let me know if
this stuff works because I've tried the
screen protectors in the past there is
without like a clean room there is no
way to perfectly apply them without
getting any bubbles or dust or anything
caught under them so so there's that
they're very difficult to get on
straight they reduce the brightness of
your screen they reduced the color
accuracy of your screen there's a whole
lot to be said against them but on the
other hand I don't know if you guys
remember when I had that cracked iPad
screen protectors will help to reduce
scratching and cracking and all that
kind of good stuff so this doesn't claim
to provide any kind of crack resistance
but it does claim to provide screen
resistance so all you have to do is
spray it on and then what you do is you
you wipe it off and leave it for 10
minutes after applying liquid armor
leave the coated screen untouched for 10
minutes to maximize the protection so
one simple application will its unique
anti-static and weather resistant
formula will repel dust for up to six
months so hassle-free bubble-free
double the scratch resistance okay
high-gloss dirt repellent and pervert
preserves the touch screen vividness I
mean these are some of the things that
okay could be pretty beneficial so let's
see what's inside the box so this is the
foam kit screen protector for all mobile
phones phones tablets and e-readers
cameras portable games laptops LED LCD
and flat panel TVs so it just comes with
a little spray bottle inside I mean this
this
be a huge problem solver for me both
from a consumer perspective just because
I don't have to have a bunch of
different products for all of my stuff
and from a retail perspective because if
you guys don't know already then you
probably weren't paying that close
attention but I work at NCI XCOM so
rather than stocking umpteen billion
different okay so as little things hand
in there and do that rather than
stocking umpteen billion different
screen protector films that only fit one
device each you can just stock this and
if anyone comes in looking for a screen
protector you just give them one of
these so that's pretty much it it comes
to here let's see what the instructions
say so how to apply you turn your device
completely off okay clean the screen
with the provided microfiber cloth which
is this one okay depending on the screen
size gently wipe okay hold on spray once
or twice on clean microfiber cloth so
that would be the other one do not spray
directly on the screen to prevent drips
and extra fluid from entering unsealed
gaps and electronic devices depending on
the screen size gently wipe with
microfiber cloth for 10 to 20 seconds
until liquid armor nano coating is
evenly distributed on your screen wipe
the screen in one direction only do not
use circular motions and avoid touching
it for at least 10 minutes at least 10
minutes I think they mean after use
because that's what it says on here yeah
after use okay now the tech film will
continue to harden over a 24 hour period
so that's how long it takes to cure and
that's it that's the whole English
instructions so what I'm gonna do then
is I'm gonna try it on my phone although
like like I said I want you guys to
leave comments and let me know if you
have any experience with this stuff
because I'm not gonna intentionally try
to scratch my phone and I don't actually
have any other glass-covered devices
that I would necessarily be willing to
take like you know two identical devices
and take a key to one of them and take a
key to the other one like in that Asus
Transformer one video because I'm not a
soos and I don't have a bunch of
Transformers lying around but thank you
for checking out Oh hold on hold on I
should show the other kit too so this
one is a convenience kit which just
includes four pre-moistened microfiber
polishing cloths so this is just without
the spray this one's probably a better
value because it
with the cloths and the and the spray-on
stuff but this I guess is well
convenient so there you go thank you for
checking out my unboxing and not yet a
first look but hopefully I'll be giving
you guys some impressions soon once I
get a better idea of what's going on
here

visible screen protector don't forget to
