product that I've received a lot of
requests to unbox this is the MSI 870 a
fusion fusion military class motherboard
this is for multi GPU computing and
let's talk first and foremost a little
bit about fusion technology it is
powered by the Lucid Hydra I forget
exactly what the chip is called but it's
powered by a lucid Hydra chip and what
that is is it's kind of like a PCI
Express bridge chip but there's actual
logic built into it that allows you to
run not only multi-gpu with two Radeon
cards or multi-gpu with two geforce
cards but unlike sli and crossfire you
can actually run non-matching cards and
still get a performance boost and you
can even run one Radeon card with one
geforce card and still get a performance
boost so one of the things that here we
go here we go
so let's sigh let's show you the
relevant information while I talk about
this a little bit more so there's n mode
which is Nvidia only ok so you can see
that there they're talking about like if
you have one higher end GPU versus maybe
you've got an older GPU and you want to
just throw in another one to get a bit
of a performance boost how much of an
increase you can get there's a mode
which is ATI only so you can run to ATI
cards even if they don't match
non-identical VGA processing any level
of VGA combinations up to 33%
performance boost and then there's ex
mode so that means you can actually run
a Rinna Dion card with a geforce card
and play 3d games which is pretty far
out there so in terms of other features
that are msi exclusive you've got their
military class that means they've got
their a hi-c cap IC choke solid caps all
of that good stuff for turn ability
they've also got support for their OC
Genie as well as core unlocking and
they've gotten some full support for USB
3.0 and SATA 6 gigabits per second so it
has all the little features but let's
have a look at the board itself and
how cool it looks and it's pretty
expensive for an aim-7 da bored but
these features cost money the Hydra chip
costs money I'll tell you that much this
is a SATA 6 gigabits per second cable
rather 2 of them a molex to SATA power
adapter alright next we have some SATA 3
gigabit per second cables two of them as
well as a molex to SATA power adapter
now please bear in mind there is no
physical difference between those cables
other than the color they will both work
just fine regardless of yes okay so here
we have the multi GPU computing
technology driver then we have the
regular drivers and utilities download
the latest from the msi website we have
a quick installation guide a manual for
their control center software as well as
a user guide for the 870 a fusion next
we have some easy front panel connectors
the M connector not to be confused with
Q connector as well as an i/o shield
then we have cameraman wants to see
something over there
not sure why and you can see they're
using Wow very secure packaging look at
that you've got like a half inch of
cardboard around this board on every
side they really don't want these things
to break and shipping I'll tell you that
much
alright here it is the 870 a fusion so
here it is a sticker for Auto
overclocking OC Genie as well as a
sticker for military class long lifetime
higher stability better overclocking
this is all good stuff and let's have a
look at the overall physical layout of
the board this is a very unique looking
board and partly due to the unique
branding on it so you can see right
there is the MS IDE multi GPU computing
that's an X if I guess presumably for X
mode which is when you're running Nvidia
and ATI cards together if you weren't
paying attention earlier now let's yeah
let's do the overall layout ok so we've
got our 8 pin power connector up in the
top left and it's ideal location you can
see the PWM is covered by
a fairly small heatsink but given that
they are using military class components
which do run cooler
according to MSI's marketing materials
that should be all that's necessary
we've got our a m3 CPU socket so you've
got full support for all the latest AMD
processors including their six cores and
that means that you also have support
for dual channel ddr3 up to 16 gigs of
ram can be inserted into these slots
over here on the right
you're 24 pin power connectors in its
ideal location along the right-hand edge
of the board and then you can see that
down a little bit further we've got all
of our SATA ports so the black ones are
gonna be say two to three gigabit per
second and these white ones right here
are gonna be say 2 3 6 and gigabit per
second the South Bridge right here is
covered by a little heatsink that's
probably not doing a whole lot and then
under years where the magic happens
though there's your North Bridge as well
as the Lucid hydrogen so I believe so
actually I'm not 100% sure that the
hydrogen shifts under there but I'm like
99% sure that it's down there somewhere
I can't verify it one way or the other
in terms of expansion slots we have 2
PCIe 16x slots and while I wish I could
say it was as simple as these are sli
ready or they're crossfire ready or
they're not ready for anything these are
ready for any number of different things
now the 878 chipset natively supports
crossfire so I'd imagine you can run
them in regular crossfire mode or you
can take advantage of that lucid Hydra
fusion technology that is integrated
into this board other expansion slots
include 2 PCIe 1x slots 1 PCI slot and
then you've got support for a whole
bunch of one two up to four front USB
connectors front firewire as well as
front audio right there you have one
auxiliary PCIe 6 pin connector so I
guess if you're plugging in a couple
really beefy GPUs you'd want to go ahead
and populate that and then here you have
an internal USB 3.0 port this is smart
because since most case manufacturers
are implementing USB 3.0 with just an
internal USB connector boom just plug it
in there and you're done so instead of
running over like most of them they're
making you route a cable around the back
out back of the board out the back of
the case and then into the back of the
motherboard on the i/o panel but MSI is
saving you the trouble here on the back
we've got two ps2 ports one Mouse one
keyboard a clear CMOS switch I love this
this is one of my personal favorite
features I love it
and then we've also got six USB 2.0
ports digital audio out in optical as
well as coaxial flavours firewire
Gigabit Ethernet one USB 3.0 port
remember the other one is there's a bug
on the motherboard box and the camera
man's gotten distracted mm-hmm remember
the other USB 3.0 port is inside for
connection to front USB then we have 7.1
audio out and not a whole lot to talk
about on the back of the motherboard
although I can probably verify I'm not
gonna take that sticker off okay I could
check the traces here I'd be able to
verify if the Hydra chips down there I
believe it is though yeah thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the 870 a
fusion from NSI</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
