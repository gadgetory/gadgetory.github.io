couple of things one is how to install
your brand-new LGA 2011 CPU into your
motherboard and the other is how to
mount the corsair h 100 to your brand
new 2011 board because this is one of
the few high-end aftermarket coolers
that is coming right out of the box with
compatibility for socket 2011 or LGA
2011 so the first thing to do is make
sure before you touch any of your gear
you have correctly grounded yourself
which means touching the casing of a
power supply that is plugged into the
wall that is the way to ground yourself
correctly the next thing is you're going
to go ahead and set your CPU aside I
know I'm holding the CPU in the first
place but it is what it is and you're
going to undo the latch with the U shape
on it so that's the latch to undo first
then you are going to undo the latch
with the sort of looks like what's the
heart rate monitor thing looks like that
okay electrocardiograph I don't know
what they're called and then you're
going to pull up on this one a little
bit and you are going to lift up the
cover so there now everything is up the
next thing you're going to do is you are
going to align the notches so you can
see there are actually one two three
four notches in the 2011 CPU two of them
are closer to the edge and two of them
are further from the edge so you're
going to carefully examine your CPU
socket and look for the two notches that
are closer to the edge of the two that
are further the other way you can check
is to see the little gold triangle in
the corner here and align that with the
triangle on the socket itself can you
see that triangle okay not really there
go until you can see the triangle better
there you go there's the triangle so you
align those two and you will never get
it wrong now you want to be very careful
when you're putting this down because
there are more than 2,000 pins in that
socket every single one of them has to
line up and contact perfectly the pad on
the bottom of the CPU so remember the
bottom of 2011 CP looks like that yes mm
little pads they all have to be perfect
so be very careful with your socket
because most motherboard magnifier
and most retailers will not cover you if
you screw this up and you break your
socket so we're going to go ahead and
put down the one with the little 90
degree bend in it then we are going to
tighten down the one with the u-shape we
have installed the CPU into the socket
the next thing I'm going to need is some
thermal compound and I thought I saw
some around here just like a minute ago
there it is okay so I'm going to apply a
fairly large amount of thermal compound
compared to what we're used to this is a
very big CPU so I'm going to go ahead
and put a line down the CPU just like
that and then I'm going to take my H 100
which you can see the H 100 we're just
using the back plate that comes with it
have a look at the back plate there's
your standard back plate and we're also
using the standard mounting hardware
that comes with it just screw that into
the back plate and that's it it's that
simple
so then you take your H 100 CPU block
you go ahead and it comes pre-cut
pre-configured to be completely
compatible with LGA 2011 and for some
reason this is uh this caught on here
that's interesting a little bit more
slack a little bit more slack there we
go okay so we just lower that down on
the appropriate pegs and finally we take
our four thumb screws and screw it down
yes that is it it is that simple to
install your H 100 on the hold on just a
minute we're gonna have to refill so
yeah we learned something off instead of
using the standard Intel procedure which
is to use the Intel pegs and then screw
those into the backplate the backplate
even though it has the appropriate holes
for 2011 the spacings right you don't
use it
you actually use these ones you screw
them directly into the built-in front
plate more of a front plate than a back
plate and that is how you will mount the
h100 here we go after you've cleaned it
off of course how that is how you will
note the h100 so that it sits down
firmly on the cpu because with the other
pegs people and you know what someone's
going to make this mistake I made this
mistake and it's a good thing I noticed
before I turned on the CPU if you use
those longer pegs then what's going to
happen is you're not actually going to
have any contact between your h100 and
the CPU itself at all so we're going to
go ahead and tighten down our thumb
screws in a diagonal pattern so I
usually tighten both of them at the same
time then we get tighter start
tightening them in crosses until they
are all the way tightened and there we
go we have installed our LGL a LGA 2011
CPU and we have installed our corsair h
100 on it remember guys you do not need
the backplate and you do not need the
standard intel mounting hardware which
works like this and goes through the
board because it just uses this plate
that's built into the motherboard to
install now one thing i do want to check
out is how much the board is bowing not
very much at all because it does have
this to increase the rigidity of the
board as a whole and then it has that
front plate to keep it from to keep it
from voting so you can actually here you
can see that surface there is quite flat
inspite of the tremendous pressure
that's being applied by the h 100 thank
