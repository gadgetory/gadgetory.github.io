Developers Conference 2016 we're not
developers but we are interested in a
lot of the same things that developers
would be one of the top trends this year
is of course the internet of things are
IOT the difference this time is that the
momentum finally seems to be really
picking up for the first time ever there
are more internet-connected devices than
there are people in the world I really
feel like I'm doing my share to make
that happen by the way and as the
install base has continued to increase
there has been an exponential increase
in software development so what if
Samsung's big announcements is Arctic a
three-tiered hardware offering the
Arctic one Arctic 5 and Arctic 10
offering a range of functionality from
pretty similar to an Arduino two capable
of machine learning and the demo they
did on stage while it might have had a
bit of a cringey high school science
presentation feel to it was really cool
because the point was to demonstrate
some of the amazing flexibility and
openness of the software and cloud side
of Arctic so they used resin io to push
an update to nine devices simultaneously
over the air without any loss of
connectivity pretty cool so let's have a
look at some of the other cool Internet
of Things stuff that's on demo here at
the developer conference so this is the
auto it's actually very similar to a
project I backed on Kickstarter a little
while ago called the jebo that I pretty
much back so that I could make fun of it
when it arrived because it wasn't going
to do anything near what the team was
promising it would be capable of and was
extraordinarily expensive but the key
difference here is that Samsung is not
positioning the auto as a retail product
but more as a proof of concept for what
their Arctic 5 processor can do so
inside the auto you've got an Arctic 5
which is an arm-based processor you've
got a high-definition camera a 320 x 240
pixel resolution screen in the front
that it uses to express itself whether
it's blinking eyes or little smiles or
whatever else the case may be a powerful
natural language engine
the lights color correct please the
lights color to green and the ability to
interact with other devices through the
Arctic cloud so in terms of demos they
had it turning on and off connected
lights they had it looking things up
similar to what an Amazon echo would do
you know who is George Clooney to which
it would reply George Timothy Clooney is
an American actor screenwriter producer
director and activist thank you very
much for that Otto it can wake up it can
go to sleep and it can even do things
like check on traffic for you if you're
heading out somewhere and for whatever
reason your phone is less convenient or
whatever the case may be and it can take
pictures for you just it can't
necessarily do anything to make you look
any better so this little number in
front of me here is called the Eddie it
was entered into the makers against
drought competition it actually ended up
in the top ten and is competing in round
two where they're going to have to take
this very prototype looking thing and
turn it into something a little more
commercially viable but the
functionality is expected to be very
similar just better what it is is a
desalinator that is to say it removes
salt from the water so they're targeting
farmers specifically in California
although the applicability would
obviously be a little wider reaching
than that who are buying brackish or
importing agricultural water with a
sullenly level that is too high for the
crop that they're trying to grow so the
way that it works is fairly
straightforward from a you know I may
need to get looking at a box perspective
the water goes in the one side you've
got these foam membrane and plastic sort
of layers here that the water goes
through and then you pump in voltage
here and what you effectively get is
highly concentrated salt water out the
other side that pumps back around
through the system and then desalinated
water out the other side so they're not
really measuring it in terms of like
liters of water process per minute
because we're not talking about making
the water potable we're talking about
targeting in particular crop so they
used avocado trees as an example and
they're saying they can handle about a
tenth of
acre per hour with the current system
although by doubling the size giving it
more membrane area they figured they
could dramatically increase the output
somewhere in the neighborhood of like
thousands of litres per hour the way
that it ties into the whole Internet of
Things thing is that it's got a whole
lot of cool stuff going here they've got
an Arctic 10 that is handling the pumps
the valves the salinity sensors and
actually connectivity that allows you to
check up on your system with the mobile
app you can monitor it in real time you
can see if there's a problem with the
system and you can even generate reports
so you can make decisions about how to
manage your fleet of Eddie's or your
crops over time so here I've taken over
the affair Oh boof completely I've
actually kicked all of their staff out
and they've abandoned it so I can talk
about what they're showing off and they
call themselves an end-to-end IOT
connectivity something anyway so
basically they've got themselves a
little development module right here
that in a nutshell is a Bluetooth
connected for GPIO connected doodad that
you can either well in a perfect world
integrate into a device at the time that
you're designing it or as part of their
demonstration of how their platform is
open and will talk to pretty much
anything you can actually literally
solder it into an existing product or
even use it to communicate with
something running a Samsung Arctic
processor like this one right here in a
nutshell their goal is to simplify
security they've got their own 256 bit
encryption layer that sits over top of
normal Bluetooth security and pairing
using QR codes on every device so that
connecting things to a smart home is
easier than it's necessarily been in the
past and on top of that they want to
make it easier for the product
developers to create interfaces for
these products so they've got a cloud
tool that effectively acts like you I
Lego and you can basically say ok this
connection right here controls this on
off switch right here drag and drop a
little box blip bloop on or off but it
doesn't just do on and off it can
actually talk spy to the device so you
could do more complex things like say ok
here's a motor power percentage value or
here's a CPU temperature that you can
report back to
user and you can design your own UI
around it or you can not totally up to
you interesting so thanks for checking
