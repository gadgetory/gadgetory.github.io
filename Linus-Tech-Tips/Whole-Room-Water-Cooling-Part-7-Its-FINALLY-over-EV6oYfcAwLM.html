a hundred degrees idle while
water-cooled but the water still has to
run through this graphics card and see
how terrible it is can you see the
floater right there it moves around if
you took the card the metal touch my
skin but the problem that I have right
now is the plan was to just remove the
graphics card from the loop put it on
the graphics card in there and then have
the loop go through this non-powered
graphics card which would hopefully not
add a new temperature to the loop and
then it would be fine but I don't even
want to run this computer on the full
loop if it's this gunk tub
Corsair delivers real McCart oh here I
have one huh real matter nothing with
their new strafe mechanical keyboard
featuring genuine German made Cherry MX
key switches click on Munchen to learn
more I'm gonna move my chin now just the
3/4 loop at last my friends it is
finally finally here the conclusion of
the whole room water cooling system
series of videos that we have waited
over a year since initially putting
these systems together to finally talk
about whether or not the concept worked
whether or not in practice it actually
worked and the wait is over only a
couple more minutes it's kind of reminds
me of that that BMW video that I was
teasing on social media not that long
ago about the only one series drop a
like on the bottom of the video if you
want to see us finally release that cuz
I think we're very close let's go so I
want to do a recap of the concept for
those who haven't been following along
the whole time our editing den is in a
south-facing room of the house that we
have been running Linus Media Group out
of for the last year and a half and it
gets friggin hot in here so my brilliant
idea was what if we took all of our
editing workstations and removed the
heat from the room via water cooling so
it started with redoing our editing
workstations which used to be just a
haphazard mix of parts that we had left
over from reviews and are now pretty
much all standardized so they've got in
600 cases from coolermaster water
cooling by Swift tech and I'll explain
why there's a radiator on the outside of
the system in spite of this whole room
water cooling I'll explain that later
we've got 49 60 X 6 core processors
those are extreme additions 32 gigs of
kingston memory Asus x99 deluxe
motherboards GTX Titan blacks so those
are 6 gig vram cards we've also got
cooler master v 750 power supplies and
all of them except Ed's O's which
actually has two of these a Quadro a 10
gigabit nic and then a V 1200 because
his system is kind of balls to the wall
and then each system has its own pump as
well so the way that it all works is
that at the back we've got kind of a
tangle of of tubing going on here so
we've got quick-release fittings here so
we can either connect to the radiator on
the top which is running quite toasty
right now or to the whole room system
and this was actually all done up by
Luke's dad who did an amazing job of
plumbing the entire room for us so you
can see the terminus station is actually
over here by Nick Van Burkle's PC so
every one of these systems has an inlet
and then an outlet and they all join
together as you go around the room we
actually left enough space to have up to
seven systems water cooled all at the
same time all on the same loop and in
the bathroom / server room this is where
the magic happens so here's our
mechanical and then UV sterilizing
filters here is our reservoir here are
dual little giant pumps and then those
lead to a radiator fan setup using
Noctua industrial PPC fan so those
waterproof dustproof ones on the roof of
the house so that we are actually
physically removing the heat from the
building in order to keep our systems
cool we've got a cover on there we've
got a power supply for all of the fans
to run as well so with that recap how
does it perform so to evaluate our
success there's a number of different
metrics to look at we can look at the
cooling performance of the individual
systems based on how hot their CPUs run
during an intensive task like video
rendering we can look at the room
temperature inside versus the
temperature outside to see if removing
the heat from the room actually yielded
any kind of benefit and we can look at
the convenience and maintenance factors
so let's start with CPU temperatures
when we're running the CPUs on their own
radiators the room reaches a temperature
of about 31 degrees so you can actually
see that right now which is about a 3
degree difference between the inside and
the
side and you should bear in mind that
that's on a day that's not particularly
sunny which can cause the room to heat
up quite a bit more than the computers
could possibly affect all the systems
and the sort of 45 degree plus range on
the CPU which is reasonable except for
Terrans which I'll talk more about later
and Ed's ELLs which has an additional
graphics card but no additional radiator
space for cooling so that one's bound to
run a little bit on the hotter side but
now what we're gonna do is we are going
to take the running whole room system
I'll show you guys how we quickly
connect and disconnect them so while
they're running probably not recommended
but we've done it so many times anyway
that it I've lost all fear of the
process all we do is use these to hook
it up to the whole room system now what
you are likely to see here is a nearly
instantaneous drop in CPU temperatures
so we've gone from 47 on core 1 to 41
and I'll make some graphs here showing
you guys the difference in CPU temps
under load from system to system so
dramatically reduce temperatures across
the board by hooking up to the whole
room system why does that work well it's
just a matter of radiator capacity we
could just as easily achieve great CPU
temperatures by hooking up much much
larger radiators as you'll see in some
very large towers that will support like
quad rads in the front duals in the top
a single in the back and the like
another advantage of this approach by
having it outside is that you don't end
up with a chain reaction of the room
temperature increasing and therefore the
cooling efficiency of your radiator
increasing because you're always tied to
ambient temperatures but that's a great
question if one of the objectives was to
lower the ambient temperature in the
room with the system how much have you
achieved the answer is not a heck of a
lot we achieved a 1 degree drop by
hooking all of these systems up which I
would consider within
sort of margin of error the sort of
vague sort of concept to being able to
align this correctly helps a lot on our
inlet so that's the cold side we're
getting twenty nine point seven degrees
and on our outlet that's the hot side we
are getting thirty point zero degrees
which I'm sure someone out there is
calculating the specific heat of this
you know mass of water or whatever the
case may be and I'm sure that we are
actually dissipating a significant
amount of the heat outside but that is
where the whole was it actually
practical thing comes into play because
by going with copper tubing which I
think we can all agree is more
aesthetically pleasing than insulated
PVC we actually created a situation
where we are dissipating a significant
amount of the heat we're pulling out of
each system into the room
anyway anyway via the copper piping so I
guess all that's really left now is do
we consider the project to success the
answer is no I still think the concept
could have worked really well but there
were a few critical things that I really
think we could have done differently
number one don't use a metal reservoir
don't use a metal reservoir find some
kind of plastic reservoir to use because
that's where the thing that I promised
to talk about later comes in teheran
system has some big problems caused by
corrosion bits stuck in his system that
even cleaning out his cpu block which
was extremely gunked-up that was a
picture I posted on Instagram could not
fix and point number two is I would
definitely recommend installing some
kind of a bleed system at the highest
point in the loop that way you are not
going to have as much difficulty filling
with the system each time compared to us
where we had to add a second pump in
order to have enough flow rate and
enough pressure in order to get the
water in and the air out of our tubing
system the other thing that I would do
differently next time is wow gee I guess
that ties into a question that we've
been asked a lot are you guys moving why
did you bother to follow this and are
you gonna do whole room water cooling at
the new place well number one we weren't
planning to move when we originally came
up with this concept and started working
on it so there's that number two no we
do not intend to water cool our systems
let alone hold room water cooler systems
at the new office we're gonna have air
conditioning which is probably the
solution that we should have gone with
in the first place if the objective was
to lower the temperature in this room
and have our computers run cooler so I
think that's pretty much it thank you
guys for sticking with us throughout the
whole room water cooling project we
learned a lot I think we established the
feasibility of it the performance and
the silence factor cannot be denied but
the convenience factor of it leaves a
lot to be desired and the the execution
of it would be extraordinarily
time-consuming and even more expensive
than what we did if you were to really
do it properly in such a way that it
would require little or zero maintenance
