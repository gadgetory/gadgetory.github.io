series of CPU installation tutorials now
this is actually what is this this is an
AM to motherboard okay so you can see
it's got the four bolt through okay
which is standard for a.m. to the older
LG are from LGA the older socket 754 and
939 only had two bolts but they did have
the same clip system that AMD uses with
a m2 m2 plus m3 754 and nine three nine
so this is going to be the same CPU
installation procedure regardless of
which one of those sockets you're using
so this particular one yeah there you
can see it's a socket am-2 right there
so it's 940 pins as I recall
so TPU now with the Intel installation
videos I did you can see that there was
a protective cover over the socket on
the motherboard not the case with AMD
these are not fragile as long as you
don't manage to like drop metal shards
or something inside those holes you're
not going to run into any problems with
physical contact with the socket with
AMD CPUs at least the consumer ones at
this point the fragile part is actually
on the CPU itself so this is an AMD
sempron if they usually come in this
kind of a clamshell with with a fuzzy
bit at the bottom and the reason for
that is that the CPU actually has all of
the pins on it so you can see this one I
have not managed to bend any of the pins
on yet and notorious for accidentally
bending pins on CPUs but I'm quite good
at fixing them at this point that's the
good news so I got my Sempron what is
this a 3,000 plus or something I don't
know what it is haven't used this guy in
a while three four hundred I don't know
okay so CPU installation on a.m. 2 a.m.
3 + 2 + a.m. 3 plus if that ever exists
I have no idea is fairly straightforward
you see this little golden triangle on
the corner of the CPU I don't mean the
circle on this side I mean the triangle
here that's going to correspond to a
triangle on the CPU socket so ah this is
going to be tough for you to see and I
apologize in advance for that but I'm
going
see how close I can get here to give you
a good look at that triangle so it's on
the corner that I'm showing you right
now I'm gonna try and get you a better
look at it if I can you see it's
probably just a matter of getting the
lighting just right hope I'm looking at
the right yeah so it's actually okay I
might just have to describe it oh no
there we go okay I think you can see it
now if I kind of cover it a little bit
okay
anyway there's a little plastic indent
in the shape of a triangle so you line
that up
I didn't even cover the first step first
up is you take the lever here and lift
it up okay so you see the socket
actually moves a little bit when you do
that that's not the motherboard moving
that's the socket
so this is a zip or zero insertion force
socket which means when I line up the
triangle with the other triangle ah now
you can see it hey that's perfect with
the other triangle and I place it on top
there you go it dropped here I'll do
this from the side but it dropped right
into the socket without me pressing it
in at all so I just kind of take it line
it up and then Boop it's in that's all
it takes
so there's there's no real force
required I mean when you push down the
lever there's a tiny bit but it's not at
all like the Intel sockets that was it
then you install your cooler so I
removed it from the protective clamshell
which has the little fuzzy on the bottom
to protect the pins and then put it in
the socket pretty simple thanks for
checking out my installation video for
a.m. to me MV into plus 750 $4.99 that's
it oh I'm trying to hit the end
recording button but it's not working
let's try this one more time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
