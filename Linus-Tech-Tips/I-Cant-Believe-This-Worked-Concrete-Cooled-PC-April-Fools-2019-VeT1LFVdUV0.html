Mountain Dew I guarantee you if it's in
fluid form somebody somewhere has filled
up a loop with it cooled their computer
and posted their results online so given
how done to death this concept is I
really never thought that we'd end up
exploring the whole like weird or wacky
exotic coolants concept that is until I
read a comment from one of our viewers
your leg oerstadt who suggested that we
try using concrete now hold on I know
what you guys are thinking but based on
some of our preliminary testing I have
reason to believe that this may actually
work over the last couple of days
alex has put together all the materials
that we're going to need to build what I
believe is going to be the world's first
concrete cooled gaming PC and this video
is brought to you by huni huni is the
free browser extension that helps you
save money at popular sites like oh I
don't know Amazon eBay and more by
finding you the best coupon codes so go
over to join honeycomb slash LTT and get
it now
all right so the first thing we're gonna
need is some hardware so we gathered up
the parts for a pretty sweet modern
gaming PC here we've got ourselves a
core i7 9700 K 16 gigs of memory we've
got our TX 2080
not too shabby I mean the thing is if
we're gonna be doing a test like this we
want to use something that's
representative of a high performance
gaming machine because if you use all
low power stuff and then you end up with
really great thermal results then all
you've managed to demonstrate is that
low powered hardware produces less heat
and doesn't run as hot as high
performance stuff so like what's the
point of that right zactly
which ones us the master case something
earlier yeah oh the maker 5t oh this is
an older one they did a bunch of
sponsored stuff with it oh no it's not
actually locked is it can we unlock it
from the inside and okay my left arm is
a little skinnier than my right for no
reason at all well problem solved
thermaltake wins by default power for
the motherboard there we go man if this
works I'm going to be just it really
shouldn't put them like you can't deny
the initial testing yeah you really
can't we weren't even gonna do this
video now people might be surprised how
many things we try and just never makes
it to video now normally these days we
use a triple 120 millimeter radiator but
again if Alex's calculations are correct
we should be able to get away with just
a double and get similar or even better
results so this is it for our build you
know it's actually got kind of like an
old-school charm to it I like it oh that
isn't there that is the heaviest bag of
coolant I have ever seen before
oh wow 34 kgs one part quikrete mortar
cement two and a quarter to three parts
masonry said yeah we're not a button
sand in there well yeah I'm obvious
reasons yeah that'd be stupid okay I'll
bring this guy oh I'll get a bucket of
water did you need my help I don't know
if for whatever reason I thought we need
to people want to like sort of hold it
and make sure but this is actually
working pretty well do we even need such
a big mixer we need like a liter of
concrete well um
have you ever made concrete before yes
actually
been a while though now that I think
about it okay I mean if we want to take
advantage of the cooling potential of it
then we have to make sure we actually
have enough concrete in there okay
that's starting to look kind of closer
look we're at a channel how the pros do
you want concrete tips you watch a
concrete Channel good look at this
yeah this will be great alright so yes
let's get a baseline reading with water
first oh great I was just gonna start
putting the concrete in no right yeah
good call good call
and that way we can make sure the system
actually even works - you know it's
funny you seem to be expressing a fair
bit of skepticism about this whole idea
but need I remind you that you were the
one who did the initial testing like
look at this hey it posted nice okay so
we've got working hardware now let's
just see if we can boot into Windows so
we're at about 35 to 40 degrees idle
let's go ahead and start our stress test
here okay pretty good about what I'd
expect so 55 to 60 degrees so everything
seems to be working normally so it seems
like it's basically leveled off like we
could run up for a while longer but
we're just at 62 degrees maximum yeah
this is exactly what we'd expect yeah
alright let's drain it we want to blow
it as much of the water as we can so
that we don't have I mean obviously the
concrete is just concrete and water so a
little bit of extra water isn't gonna
kill it but we don't want to get our
ratio off think you know I'm beginning
to have some second thoughts need to be
a bit water here hold on a second look
at this as it moves you can actually see
it turn more liquid that's what you were
saying was supposed to help us right see
like you can see it's really solid but
as it moves it actually turns to a
liquid so you can see the reservoir is
actually filling up a lot better than we
expected well than I expected anything I
don't know what your expectations were
so I am more than halfway done check
this out and what's crazy is you can
actually see that even though it's
clearly a liquid cuz it's flowing in
there it's kind of solid right now how's
that gonna affect things when you get
the pump okay uh we might need to power
cycle it a couple times but it also
might just work for those wondering this
is why we use half inch tubing because
you're gonna need a pretty thick with
two c's to in order to get concrete
through it so how do we do this without
making a mess all the tubes yeah oh
that's not a problem
spray it down with some water and then
just give it a wipe down with this I
mean it's not gonna be perfect but yeah
for sure oh this is exciting so we've
got two pieces of tubing filled so we
can go ahead and attach the pump so Alex
this is great I've got two of the tubes
on already mm-hmm and I can actually
attach the other one to the res right
now oh nice okay I guess this is the the
moment of truth so when we do get the
the heat and the pump going it should
like make it more liquidy and just kind
of get her on through but uh these are
like the heaviest tubes I think I've
ever felt and that that looks really
thick in there
oh that sound do you hear the palm wait
oh it's moving it
it sounds questionable but uh I think
you already don't know I've already
posted you have got to be kidding me
this shouldn't work okay so I want a
second I was pretty scared up to now but
why does this work can you are you
seeing this no though the tubes like are
you seeing this it is her idling it's
moving I don't think at 24 we really
4000 check this check the step 28
maximum no way art we jumped like rate
up to like 50 to 4 wait what do you mean
52 you mean on the other one yeah on the
last one we jumps like Oh even though
the coolant is moving like you can
clearly see there's flecks that aren't
it's almost like there's an inner
channel of movement but around the
outsides of the tubes it doesn't move at
all right you're not maximum 48 degrees
so like we can leave this for a bit the
thing about water cooling is that
normally you only get heat being
transferred at the block and at the rad
yeah because like the great thing about
waters that has such a high heat
capacity right yeah well that's exactly
why water is supposed to be the best
thing for liquid cooling well what the
thing is is that concrete is sort of
like a ceramic of sorts but a ceramic
that you can like have sort of flowing
around right so it not only is like
heating up there and there but it's also
like getting into the concrete that can
deposit the heat into the water all
along here and then like all along here
it will be just taking that heat away so
much sense that's why nobody likes
having like a concrete floor in their
bedroom like when you get out of bed and
you step onto a concrete floor
immediately it draws all the heat away
from your feet and like same thing with
like a basement then that's why your
basement never
gets hot in the summer so why has nobody
ever explored this before we are sitting
right now at anywhere from 49 to 50
degrees Celsius that is a significant
improvement and if you look at this the
CPU temp is actually at 28 degrees
that's a 10 degree Delta from just water
so this is incredible I mean it doesn't
look great I mean we could we can clean
it up a fair bit yeah everything but you
know it doesn't look amazing
but the results totally speak for
themselves I mean is it high-five time I
think so just my hands are kind of cold
for working which makes sense again
that's why your hands get cold when you
work with it like it's so obvious now
- you have to come see this what's up
just just come along it's a kind of bad
things oh no it's not the concrete PC is
it you know how we just kind of left it
last night yeah cause like you know my
god it's not running yeah I think we had
like a brownout or something last night
oh no yeah oh crap this like doesn't
Bend but like I don't know if you can
see in there but this is clearly
problematic yeah like we we could maybe
try turning it on seeing if it'll go but
oh I don't think that's a very good
shoot okay so we've definitely
identified the downside to concrete
cooling but that kind of comes with the
territory with any sort of enthusiast
grade solution and I don't think it's
unreasonable to expect people to have a
UPS so given that we got a 10 degree
improvement in our CPU temps I'm still
comfortable recommending it we have
certainly seen computer hardware
aficionados do more crazy things for
less benefit than that speaking of more
for less our sponsor for today's episode
