Smart TVs so this is part of their a 6
Series all right and the reason I'm
unboxing this is that I need it for a
demo that I will be doing once we have
the TV set up in a new retail store that
I'm actually not sure if it is yet
announced and I'm getting kind of a
funny look from camera man I think these
kind of thing no no it's okay don't
worry about it cuz it'll be announced
soon so anyway yes that is why I am
opening up this TV and there are some
pretty cool things about this particular
one right here that I do want to demo so
this is a smart TV does it say that on
the other side of the package on it does
okay that is exactly what camera man is
looking at over there so a smart TV what
does that mean it means you have a web
browser so you can access the internet
on your big screen you also have a Smart
Hub which is a new convenient way of
experiencing constantly growing content
with Samsung Smart TV and it also means
that you can use the network connection
to access additional functionality that
TVs were previously not capable of doing
so the first thing we find inside is a
little bracket e bit the next thing you
find inside if she's home very thin
packaging here we're gonna oh yeah we're
totally gonna do it China China iPhone
thickness comparison to show you guys
these size are the thickness of the
packaging of this particular television
set
okay homecoming out cameraman made some
kind of gesture at me and not sure
detoxified
oh I'm gonna have to put this on the
floor give me a sec guys alright so the
first thing we found here was a big sign
that has stopped if you have a problem
with your TV follow these steps before
you return your TV to the store I'm
having trouble reading upside down so
I'm go ahead look at the TV an external
device confirm you have selected the
correct video source all that good stuff
there's this band I did take that aw or
I did unpack that off camera just to
make life a little bit easier for myself
and cameraman here to cover so I can
show you guys and I haven't even told
you what modulus is this is the UN 46 D
6300 SF so basically all you need to
know is it's 46 inches actually I'm
gonna leave this on for now until I put
it on to the tent it's 46 inches in a
six series so this is not the highest
series but it's also not the lowest
series from Samsung it has 240 Hertz
technology which basically just means
that with a 60 Hertz single it is there
it is injecting more black frames in
order to give you that clearer smoother
sort of appearance I just did my iphone
for thickness comparison let's go ahead
and have a look at the yeah let's have a
look at what we got in terms of inputs
over here so we have USB USB digital
audio out USB we have four HDMI ins
including one that is apparently
compatible with DVI we also have avian
which is music yes I can reach using a
breakout cable capable of accepting both
component as well as your stereo audio
connectors next we have PC in which is
VGA and 10 in so there's your coaxial
you've also got composite in so that's
the AV in 2 and finally you've got audio
out
yech stealing okay and a land port so
there's a ton of input options and
output options over here and oh this is
interesting for best cable connection to
this product be sure to use cables with
maximum thickness as below now you go
maximum thickness 0.55 inches
fascinating okay so we're gonna go ahead
and mount this to the stand and then
we'll be pretty much ready to show it to
you properly because right now I have to
hold the thing up while I'm doing this
so in terms of setup all you got to do
is take the stand here on the back slide
it into position it's important to slide
it into position rather than trying to
push it into position because otherwise
it will not line up correctly with the
bottom tools so if we go ahead and put
four screws in here there's a box on the
back here as well so you can secure your
TV with one of those little notebook
security locks all right
once that's done there are four more
screws which we use in a moment but
we're gonna go ahead and take the TV and
put it on to the stand so yeah yeah and
it balances right there which makes
these screws significantly easier to
install TV assembly has gotten like so
simple now as you can tell I don't do
TVs that often I ended up with two extra
leftover screws would you like to know
why well the reason is because I'm
supposed to do these four screws so
putting this piece into the bottom stand
first and then put the whole thing into
the TV for now I'm gonna leave it so
that I can just show you guys how the TV
looks and the accessories that are
included with it so we've got your
standard Samsung remote this looks
exactly like the Samsung remote that I
have at home for my TV and then we've
also got some batteries for the remote
here are those breakout cables that I
told you guys existed I'm not sure if
you believed me but there you are so
there's your component there's your
composit it's really nice to Samsung to
include these because sort of weird
adapters can often be very very
difficult to source these are for using
the vase amount okay these look like
some kind of spacer thing that goes on
here so there you have that it does have
a vase amount and next thing we find
back here besides the little cable
management piece is the low profile hey
check that out this TV has an included
power brick and spite of its goodness so
there's your power it nice low profile
cable so you can go ahead and run that
somewhere discreetly so let's uh hey
there's your rotation so you can hit it
wait and I'm going to go ahead and pull
off the plastic covering so you guys can
see what the finished product looks like
simply gorgeous see these are getting so
thin now unbelievable okay so thank you

inspected throwing boxing's reviews and
other computer videos and I really look
forward to bringing you guys some video
content about the Smart TV features of
this particular product upcoming and
cameraman reads to me because I forgot
to mention throughout all of this that
NCIX sells TVs now so yes when you go to
the new NCIX store which I'm not the one
