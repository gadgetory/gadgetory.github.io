multiple graphics cards in your gaming
system it's kind of like dual wielding
and Tomb Raider more firepower at the
expense of some accuracy but while this
truth has remained something of a
constant SLI technology has existed for
almost 20 years
and has undergone many changes to reach
its current state today so how did we
get from here to here
math drops vast 35 inch curved ultrawide
monitor features a 34 40 by 1440
resolution and hundred hertz refresh
rate check it out at the link below the
year was 1998 Windows 98 with support
for DirectX 5 was the hot new chick on
the block having a Pentium 2 was a
gamer's fever dream quake and unreal
tournament were fresh on the scene and
the first mp3 player had just launched
so yeah ancient history at that time
there were actually three key players in
the 3d acceleration scene ATI since sold
to AMD and divide it out as Radeon
technologies group Nvidia that's with a
big V my friends and 3d FX interactive
and the high performance graphics cards
they made looked a little something like
this
our focus is on the 3d effects Vudu - it
had a whopping 4 megabyte frame buffer +
4 megabytes per texture mapping unit or
TMU for a total of 12 Meg's of blazing
fast 90 megahertz II do
Ram see these three separate chips here
one is the main graphics processor while
these two are actually outboard TM use
for your reference
the current flagship Titan XP from
Nvidia has 240 of these all of them
built right into the die now 3d effects
is philosophy generally prioritized raw
speed over features for example their
cards only even supported 16-bit color
in 3d mode and they typically leg behind
the competition in adopting new
graphical features however these cards
were so popular at the time that their
proprietary API glide was adopted by
major titles like unreal and provided
both higher frame rates and superior
image quality which in turn helped 3d
effects win and maintain for a time
market share and it was this
first for speed that drove their
research and development team to invent
a technology that enabled a 3d workload
to be split between two accelerators in
a single system SLI been called scanline
interleave was born and it seems obvious
in hindsight but the concept of having
each card render alternating lines of a
3d image was brilliant in its simplicity
with all this horsepower you could play
it up to 1024 by 768 I'm serious
1024 by 768 in 3d of course such a
revolutionary technology had its
drawbacks and teething issues aside from
the expense of a pair of Voodoo twos at
2:49 us a pop you also needed a killer
CPU preferably overclocked to eliminate
bottlenecks a dedicated separate 2d card
and a motherboard with support for this
janky triple card configuration plus
your network card modem sound card etc
without running into resource allocation
issues making matters worse game
developer support was limited and the
games that did work sometimes exhibited
rendering artifacts and instability
none of this stopped 3dfx from banking
on this technology to help it compete
with more feature Laden competition
though and as for how that worked out
well the company's last hurrah was a
single card dual GPU solution the 5500
and shortly afterward 3dfx folded and
its assets were bought out by Nvidia
whose scalable link interface
implementation of SLI will have to wait
for part 2 of this story today is all
about the ghosts of land parties past
courtesy of the Slavs vintage gaming
hardware collection I bring you fully
functional the first SLI setup ever
rocking a 700 megahertz Pentium 3 copper
mine processor with SSE this
well-preserved Dell dimension t700 R was
perfect for the job
once we upgraded it with a 40 gig hard
drive a real vortex 2 soundcard and a 10
100 NIC to complement its 56k modem we
watched her or rather listened to her
come to life and if that floppy seek
doesn't bring back memories well you
guys must be a little younger than me
getting the software set up on any pre
broadband machine is a bit of a chore
not helping matters is that if we didn't
install the drivers in the right order
we ended up in a blue screen loop and
had to reload the OS but eventually we
were ready and this was particularly
exciting for me personally having never
seen Mbutu SLI actually running in
person
first impressions then scaling was
pretty good in 3d mark 99 at a hundred
and sixty two percent of the performance
of a single card then it fell off to a
hundred and twenty three percent in 3d
mark two thousand and one hundred and
twenty percent in 3d mark 2001 the
latter two results can probably be
attributed not only to the lack of a
proper SLI profile both of these
benchmarks came out after 3d effects has
demise but also to the fact that 2000
and 2001 rely more heavily on transform
and lighting which we do cards had to
offload to the CPU causing system-wide
bottlenecking
of course though we were just as
interested in actual gaming performance
and even more importantly we wanted to
see the legendary Glide in action so get
ready for screen capture first we fired
up quake 2 and used the opening sequence
to gauge the relative performance
between OpenGL and Glide
but while our original testing suggested
we'd be looking at double the frame rate
with Glide we later realized that the
Voodoo dry
servers overrode any and all in-game
buffer swap settings and required an
add-in DLL in order to turn that feature
off so much to our surprise the OpenGL
render mode actually ended up
outperforming glide with just a single
card but had no scaling in sli which
enabled our two Voodoo's to break
through the 100 FPS mark at 800 by 600
scaling a hundred and seventy-three
percent and ending up on top next up
unreal the quake 2 killer and the
best-looking game of all time again we
used the opening demo and the results
were even more astonishing than in quake
I mean would you look at that reflective
surface on the bridge this was in 1999
for context this is what console gamers
were dealing with at that point and you
can clearly see too that the framerate
is smooth as butter compared to direct3d
and OpenGL with a 120 percent sli
scaling factor according to our testing
with that said when cross-checking our
scaling results we did notice that the
bench markers of your reported observing
better sli scaling but every other
graphics driver retried would hard
lockup and glide before a benchmark run
could even be completed not to be
discouraged though we finally put our
machine to the test in the granddaddy of
all arena shooters the original Unreal
Tournament using the original renderers
circa 99 first the slab tried direct3d
and I think I think I'll buy his leg
excuse on this one then he tried opengl
but with similar results time to call
the pros at one 900 get help
good day get help tech support line
please state the case of your FPS
emergency I'm actually being owned by
bots graphics card
using its voodoo - in SLI you need to
enable glide renderer how do I do that
move I'll do it
there and would you look at that smooth
as butter so there you have it an
amazing piece of gaming history restored
and fully functioning so stay tuned for
part two and the next stage of the
evolution of SLI tunnel bear is the
easy-to-use VPN and it includes
important features like a kill switch
now normally before you connect to your
VPN when you connect to a network let's
say a Wi-Fi hotspot all of your traffic
is actually unencrypted so in the few
seconds that it takes to connect you've
probably already broadcast your IP maybe
a few DNS requests or a search query
well vigilant bear from tunnel bear
stops this from happening by blocking
all outbound and inbound traffic so
nothing leaks out before you connect
this helps keep you private throughout
the entire connection time and if your
connection goes down for some reason
vigilant bear kicks back in and stops
all outbound and inbound traffic again
until your VPN connection comes back
Tunnel bear has clients for PC Mac
Android iOS and even a Chrome extension
and you can try it for free by going to
tunnel bear comm slash LTT we're gonna
have that linked below so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
check out the link to where to buy the
stuff we featured maybe new SLI stuff I
don't know at the link in the video

store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
