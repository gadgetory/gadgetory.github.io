the CES 2017
this giant tilted cube of dreams cost
599 dollars and you're going to like it
or not but either way I will tell you
about it okay so first things first why
is it tilted well there's three zones
there's the main computer compartment
which takes up these two squares then
there's the power supply which is the
bottom square then there's the storage
which is the top square and they're each
their own cooling zones this also makes
it so that the first zone with the whole
system in it is able to breathe in
through the bottom breathe in through
the front and exhaust out of the top the
bottom of the case is just a filtered
passive intake the front of the case has
a 1 by 120 millimeter area and the top
of the case can fit up to a 3 by 120
millimeter rad or individual fans if you
would like the current configuration is
the water cooler for a fury X a blank
spot which is covered by a panel and
then another spot which is taken up by
the 1 by 120 millimeter radiator for the
CPU you may also notice while looking in
here that the motherboard looks a little
funky that's because it is a Omen
motherboard and that is a Olman cooler
as much of Oman's stuff going on in here
you can buy this case as a system with
everything in it from HP or you can buy
this case as a system with everything in
it from main gear if you want one that's
even more tooled up with maybe custom
water cooling whatever else going on
this section gets covered by one large
sleek panel but if you want there will
be an option with a window in the future
but we don't have one of those here this
is a prototype at the front of the case
that one panel that I mentioned the
power supply went behind that has the
omen symbol on it and if you take that
off and then unscrew another little
tools panel you can get access to screws
you can feed in through for the cables
you can get your little wrench tool and
there will eventually be a tool for
removing the panels that are on the back
of the case which I couldn't do this
time because we didn't have it not that
I didn't try on the right side top
there's a bunch of i/o first off there's
a power button then there's a mic then
there's a headphone and mic combo port
just case you have a 4-pole headset then
there is 2 USB 3.1 gen2 USB 3.1 gen2
type-c ports and then there is a
full-size SD card reader below that you
have your
five bass they're all hot swappable they
all lock-in and have this really cool
like cloth tab that you're able to pull
them out with which is actually pretty
wicked when all of them are closed it
looks nice and sleek and they're
compatible with both sada and you dot
two depending on if you put your drive
on the top of the cage or on the bottom
of the cage the unit that I have here
doesn't have u2 in it yet just because
again it's a prototype so I can't
actually show you that but they promise
me you dot two will be installed on all
of these on release as I mentioned
earlier they're working with sis a lot
our system integrators so they have a
feature for them as well inside the
system there's this little bracket thing
that actually squishes the graphics card
in it's not supporting it from the
bottom it's not supporting it from the
top it's actually holding it in towards
the motherboard and that will hopefully
make it so if you ship one of these or
the graphics card installed it's not
going to snap or break off the
motherboard i/o is interesting it's
basically just a whole bunch of USB 3.1
gen2 on ports one Ethernet port one line
out an HDMI port which is covered
because you should all be using your
graphics card at an optical Jack that's
sort of it again this is a HP custom
motherboard not another brands and that
is it for the $599 cube of doom that
they call the omen PC what do you guys
think is it worth your money let me know
in the comments down below I am very
interested to see what you guys think
I expect a grand discussion amongst many
comments and also thank you to
