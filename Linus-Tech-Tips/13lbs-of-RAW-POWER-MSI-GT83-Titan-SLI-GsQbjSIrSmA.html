dongle if any of those words are part of
your vocabulary go ahead and delete them
right now because when msi called us and
asked if we wanted to check out their
latest and greatest iteration of the GT
eight series we actually had to go check
and see if we had enough space in the
warehouse and after careful
consideration and a game of tetris in
real life we realized that this photo on
MSI's website was not to scale so as big
as it was we could make it happen so
fast forward two weeks and here we are
with the msi gt80 3 vr 7 RF titan sli by
msi or as i'll be calling it ryan but is
its performance as big as its name let's
find out shall we
because that's what we do
the phoenix auteur is a full-sized
minimalistic li designed keyboard
complete with Cherry MX switches and a
new white backlit variant check it out
at the link below the first thing you'll
notice about Ryan aside from his
aggressive shape is that he's freakin
huge if you know what I mean
the second thing you'll notice is that
he is freaking heavy the laptop itself
weighs over 13 pounds and when you add
on the twin power bricks at 3 pounds
each that a evoke a certain you know
failed 90s game console you end up with
a total carry weight of 19 pounds I hope
you've been working out but what all
will you get to bring with you
no dongles new things with the diagonal
screen size of 18 point 4 inches and a
maximum thickness at the back of 69
millimeters Ryan has plenty of room in
the trunk for hardware he's packin dual
GTX 1080s
in SLI a ball and cooling system with 15
heat pipes 229 blade fans and a smaller
25 blade fan and he's got room for io2
you get support for up to three external
4k 60 Hertz displays if you use the
Thunderbolt 3 port as a display port
port he's got a blu-ray burner and a
plethora of audio outputs including
Toslink and an extra headphone jack for
the excellent included ESS sabre deck
for your portable headphones not that
you'll be using Ryan on the go much
balancing the GT 83 on my boney frail
lap is an exercise in frustration a lap
top this is not especially when you
consider the placement of the
SteelSeries designed keyboard on the
subject of
which linear RGB Cherry MX speed
switches may appeal to some but I
actually personally miss the tactile
bump of the previous models Brown key
switches to be clear this is still a
full mechanical keyboard on a laptop
which is dope a s as the kids say but
that doesn't make it immune to criticism
not only did they again replicate this
key for some reason the significant lip
around the edge of the keyboard returns
with no wrist rest included to make it
more comfortable it is something you'll
get used to but there's definitely a
learning curve and the same goes for the
trackpad I tell you guys the number of
times that I type something and reach
down to yeah right to its credit it's
got a smooth consistent feel with
satisfyingly tactile buttons and
touching this corner turns it into a
lackluster numpad for emergencies but
it's clearly sidelined by the keyboard
and the internals meaning that's just
another usability disadvantage though in
fairness to NSI if you're carrying this
monstrosity around they probably expect
you to have a mouse in your wagon as
well and you can even throw in a USB
numpad if you were into that sort of
thing but will you also need some
speakers MSI doesn't think so and in
this case we actually agree the Titans
for speaker 1 subwoofer setup got plenty
loud in our testing with a surprising
fullness to the sound even if it's a
little light on the subject
allowed us to drive even high-end
headphones with MSI's majimak to
providing excellent virtual surround for
gaming before we move on to performance
testing though we really need to talk
about the display you don't often see an
18 point 4 inch laptop monitor but it's
strange size doesn't make it factory
calibrated 100% srgb IPS panel any
that's beautiful where it does lose
points is its resolution refresh rate
and lack of standout features like
g-sync
a balls-to-the-wall gaming laptop
powering a 1080p 60 Hertz gaming
experience with screen tearing feels a
little like watching Emma Watson get
married to a gopher it's just a total
mismatch so then with all of that out of
the way let's move on to testing our
Ryan is spec to the max with a one
terabyte twin nvme raid zero storage
array but MSI calls super raid load
games works in seconds all right then
let's load games we'll be comparing
against our Sega NP 98-73 and the Acer
predator 21 X on the laptop side as well
as two comparable desktop setups with
the answer to the most important
question coming first is ryan worth his
weight in frames per second actually yes
the Sager tops the charts but the Titan
GT 83 crushes the rest of the
competition with our predator 21 X
actually coming in below our desktops to
the surprise of nobody who has ever
picked it up weighted averages aside
though the Titan found itself near the
bottom of our performance laptop pack
with the DirectX 11 modes of both Deus
Ex mankind divided and rise of the Tomb
Raider but gained significant traction
with the DirectX 12 modes for honor saw
the Titan in turbo mode pick back up to
become the highest of our minimum frame
rate performers and only the GTX 1080 Ti
desktop surpassed the Titans turbo
minimum in GTA 5 with that said though
it's average frame rates we're again at
the back of the line up with Ghost Recon
wildlands echoing that average result
under full I 264 load our
CPU got up to a cozy 88 degrees while
fur mark worked our heat pipes overtime
with toasty GPUs at 85 and 90 degrees
with cooler boost enabled temperatures
dropped to 85 on the CPU with the GPUs
at 85 and 81 but of course it gets a
shall we say a fair bit louder so who is
the Titan GT 83 Ryan Edition for exactly
with its MSRP of 54 hundred US Dollars
and minimum effort one-year warranty
it's not going to be winning any top
value Awards
I mean seriously MSI you could have at
least given us the full version of
winzip to go along with our Norton trial
but I can't fault the performance and
while our desktops obviously come ahead
in terms of performance per dollar they
aren't as portable as Ryan and compared
to similarly SPECT offerings from Acer
and Sager the GT 83 Titan is right in
the ballpark or should I say
baller park yeah I went there
so you heard from your nephew or niece
or whatever that a VPN is a good idea
and you go and you look into it you're
like what DNS configuration port
forwarding are you kidding me tunneled
there takes all that crap out of setting
up a VPN for personal use you download
tunnel there it's available for PC Mac
Android iOS they even have a Chrome
extension you press like one button and
boom your internet connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and you appear to the websites and
services that you want to use online as
though you are some anonymous person
from some other random country allowing
you to access services that maybe you
normally wouldn't be able to they've got
a top rated privacy policy and they do
not log your user activity and the best
part of all of this is you don't have to
take my word for it you can try it for
free with five hundred megabytes of data
and no credit card required when you
choose to get a year of unlimited data
you can even save 10%
