all-new Radeon HD 6950 so this is the
latest addition to the 6000 series of
graphics cards from AMD
just like the 68 70 and the 68 50 which
were released a little while ago the 69
70 and the 69 50 have a very very
similar feature set to those cards but
as you might imagine because of the
higher number they have more performance
more more overall muscle so let's go
ahead and start opening the box because
that's what I do on this channel tonight
open this up so this is a DirectX 11
graphics card as you might expect it has
full support for AMD Eyefinity
technology with up to 4 displays so that
is one of the features that it does have
in common with its little brother the
6850 and here's something that I also
wanted to mention about this part so
Andy's numbering scheme has changed I
did mention higher numbers are better
and that is generally true however when
they switched from the 5000 series to
the 6000 series
the 5870 was actually not meant to be
replaced by the 6870 the 5870 was
replaced by the 6970 now and the 6870
replaced the old 5770 in terms of where
they fall in the overall pricing stack
okay so this 6950 should be compared as
like an evolutionary next step to the
last generations
5850 that's what we're comparing it to
so compared to the 5850 we've added much
beefier tessellation performance we've
added hdmi 1.4 8 we've added Eyefinity
support for up to 4 monitors instead of
only 3 and we have also added more
performance and more ram so this is a 2
gigabyte graphics card compared to the
one gig that was 2
on 58 50s and 5870 see I'm totally going
to get my signals crossed on all of
these numbering schemes okay let me just
see if there's anything else that I need
to mention oh yeah we've got support for
AMD HD 3d technology which means you can
play 3d games 3d blu-rays we have a
driver CD which you should throw away as
well as an installation guide for how to
install your graphics card we have full
support for 7.1 Audio with the built-in
HDMI port as well as full support for
AMD crossfire X technology so that is
three way or two way on this particular
card and I guess I better get that sorry
about that guys alright let's have a
look at what we've got in terms of
accessories not a whole lot actually
this is a fairly bare-bones package but
I've got no problem with that personally
ah ok so here we've got a crossfire
bridge which is expected and then we
have a DVI to VGA adapter although if
you're really still using a VGA monitor
or a VGA cable and you're buying a $300
graphics card you might want to rethink
your priorities and then next we've got
a mini DisplayPort to display port
adapter this one's pretty useful because
not too many people out there are using
mini DisplayPort monitors or many
DisplayPort cables so as long as you buy
a DP monitor if it comes with a cable
you will be able to connect your
graphics card because this particular
card does not have even a single
standard DisplayPort connector it relies
on mini DisplayPort to get basically to
squeeze some extra space onto the back
i/o shield so that you can plug in up to
4 displays all right so here's the card
itself the Radeon 69 50 I love power
colours graphics actually they've got
like just kind of a badass like robot
Knight like futuristic glowing eye dude
he has like wings and he has like a huge
sword that's uh I mean if you actually
kind of extend it from where it's cut
off by the fan
it probably ends about here so it's like
taller than he is and he looks pretty
tall so yeah most people don't care
about the graphics I do whatever all
right we've got a power color sticker
here and then we've got pretty much the
same fan we've seen AMD using for the
last little while on their high-end
graphics cards let's move around to the
top and then on the top of the card
we've got our power plug so we have dual
6 pin PCI Express and one of the things
I noticed about this card is it's one of
the first I've ever seen that doesn't
come with molex to PCIe connectors so
make sure you have a power supply with
two PCI Express 6 pin connectors and
actually why don't we have a quick look
at the side of the box and see what 12
volt rail amperage they recommend 500
water greater power supply with two
6-pin PCI AM okay they don't say
anything about 12 volt rail okay so also
on the top of the card we have a couple
of other things we have the crossfire
connectors that is for two-way or 3-way
crossfire and then we have a little dip
switch here that is for flashing the
BIOS on this particular graphics card
some of the exhaust is actually done
right here at the top and then you can
clearly see down there the vapor chamber
cooler that it that this card comes
equipped with just like the 69 70 it's
big brother
so speaking of its big brother the
actual difference between the 68 50 69
50 and the 69 70 is that it has fewer
functional units they both have the same
amount of RAM and is also clocked a
little bit lower it also consumes less
power and it is cheaper so it's a
slightly cut-down 69 70 here on the back
we find that same red and black pattern
that we recognize from the 68 70 and the
68 50 as well as its Big Brother on the
bottom we find a standard PCI Express
2.0 slot and lots of interesting
stickers with serial numbers and whatnot
on the back and I love this i gushed
about it in my 69 70 unboxing already so
I'm not going to do it too much on this
one but I love the the heat spreader on
the back it's awesome makes the card
look really really sharp and I mean even
if you install a water block or like an
aftermarket cooler
most of them support keeping the
backplate on so it really makes the
whole thing look really nice so on the
back of the card we're going to find all
of our inputs and outputs and no inputs
really mostly output and we will find
out what they are so first of all we
have an air output exhaust that is so
this card is kind of half and half
external exhaust and internal exhaust
and then we've also got two DVI
connectors one HDMI and two de mini
DisplayPort adapt connectors not
adapters so when you're running four
monitors you're going to want to plug in
either two DVI and two mini DisplayPort
or one DVI one HDMI and two mini
DisplayPort you can't use all three of
these and one DisplayPort likewise if
you're running three monitors you can't
just use these three you have to use two
of these three and then one of these two
four triple monitor support so thank you
