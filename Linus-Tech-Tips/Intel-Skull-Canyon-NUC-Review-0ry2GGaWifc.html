mini ITX rigs have become something of a
trend the last few years as
manufacturers like ZOTAC and gigabyte
have learned to do more with less space
but today we've got a PC that's
literally not much bigger than a pint
and features high-end components and
expandability that will make even some
mid tower systems blush its Intel's new
skull Canyon nook the latest in their
line of small form factor computers but
is this little machine decorated with a
skull just an attempt at voodoo magic or
can it really trade blows with an
expensive desktop rig let's find out
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours through the link
in the video description down below so
it surprised me that most right off the
bat is how light this thing is despite
its laundry list of primo components by
my estimation this thing is roughly
about the same weight as a Chipotle
burrito so it's pretty freakin portable
that way volume wise it takes up just
about the same amount of space as a
couple of soda cans or a fifth of vodka
if that's your kind of thing but please
don't try to figure that out yourself if
you're underage
anyways despite how small light this
thing is there's no shortage of goodies
under the hood you get a skylake core i7
6770 HQ with a 2.6 gigahertz base clock
and a 3.5 gigahertz turbo with iris pro
580 graphics which is intel's current
top and integrated GPU a pair of ddr4
so-dimm slots that support 32 gigs of
memory 2 m dot 2 slots that support 80
millimeter SSDs and our full speed PCI
Express capable slots dual band wireless
AC and NFC header Bluetooth support to
keep in mind this is a bare-bones kit
however so you'll need to provide your
own storage and RAM that's why we didn't
say specs for those in particular moving
to the outside there's a power button
which is you know always useful and
that's the XC card reader a pair of USB
3.0 ports including one optimized for
charging a headphone jack and an IR
sensor you can use if you have a you
know compatible device or whatever
around the back there's a power
connector for the included 120 watt
power brick an interesting combo 3.5
millimeter audio and Toslink jack so if
you can get an adapter you can output
digital 5.1 signal to a surround system
and Gigabit Ethernet then there's two
more USB 3.0 ports a mini DisplayPort
Thunderbolt 3.0 for high-speed external
storage or an external GPU enclosure
like the Razer core and HDMI 2.0 for 4k
at 60 Hertz although I wouldn't try to
push those kind of frame rates while
gaming on the I GPU however it is kind
of useful for a feature if you're doing
other things at 4k and want your general
experience to look much smooth
the exterior design features Intel's
trademark skull keeping with the skull
Canyon overall theme but if having bones
all over your electronics isn't really
your bag intel does thoughtfully include
a top plate that's otherwise the same
but sans the skull the screws that hold
it on are captive which is a nice touch
since they're quite small and would be
otherwise easy to lose if you're lucky
enough to own your own 3d printer Intel
also provides files on their website
that allow you to create a custom cover
for the nook that will fit correctly and
you also get vasa mounting hardware if
you want to screw the nook to your
monitor and create an hour SATs
all-in-one once you turn it on you can
get to the more comprehensive than
expected intel visual bios which
features a modern GUI and lots of
interesting options even including
adjustable settings for overclocking but
more on that in a minute but is this
little guy worthy of the extreme
sounding skull canyon name let's turn to
our benchmarking results to find out
starting with the CPU bound 7-zip and
Cinebench r15 or the next core i7 6770
HQ didn't quite touch our full fat
desktop 6700 K but still managed some
very solid scores and beat out our razor
blade stealth 15 which contains the
slightly lower performing but still very
high-end 6700 HQ so intensive
multi-threaded applications should be no
problem for the Nook but what about
gaming although there's some serious
potential here if you hook up an
external graphics card via Thunderbolt
we unfortunately didn't have a razor
core at the time we tested the Nook but
that did give us a chance to see if the
integrated iris pro 580 graphics
solution could tread water both Star
Wars Battlefront and the notoriously
punishing Crysis 3 ran at 31 FPS at
1080p on medium settings yeah seriously
totally playable frame weight with
decent settings on a graphics processor
strapped into a CPU wicked Grand Theft
Auto 5 was also a positive experience
coming in at 32 FPS at 1080p using the
default settings and FXAA
although we saw some dips into the low
20s at times the game is still perfectly
playable Rises
waiter was a little bit of a different
story as we had to turn it down to hit
even 25 SPS at 720p but overall as long
as you keep your expectations reasonable
you can still enjoy modern titles in a
pinch at respectable frame rates but
given that the Nook is such a small
package could it manage heat adequately
when putting such a load on the CPU and
its integrated GPU well sort of the CPU
heated up to 87 degrees Celsius during
our 7-zip benchmark and 79 on our Crysis
3 skybox test and a whopping 100
throttling it down right when we stress
test with i-264 so trying to overclock
probably isn't a good idea even though
the BIOS does let you tinker with clock
speeds the ID 64 test caused the system
through throttle like I mentioned but no
such throttling was observed in our
other benchmark so you probably won't
have to worry about it too much when
gaming or putting a reasonable load on
the CPU not like a benchmark stress test
thing despite the slightly too hot for
comfort temperatures another positive is
that even with said temperatures the top
bezel only got 242 degrees Celsius at
its warmest spot so there won't be any
painful surprises if you need to handle
the Nook during heavy use of course this
kind of performance in a small
form-factor comes at a cost 650 us to be
exact we went on PC part picker to see
what a similarly configured Mini ITX
bare-bones system would cost and we came
up with an estimate of about four
hundred sixty-five dollars so a total
difference of $185 and that's - the card
reader Thunderbolt support and iris pro
graphics so like not on the same level
at all really
but despite the Nook giving you these
add-ons you are paying a premium to get
everything shrunk down into an
attractive lightweight device but this
also means you're getting mostly
uncompromised performance in the
smallest package we've seen yet even on
the eye GPU and with the capability to
pair the nook with an external graphics
card do have possibly the ultimate tiny
gaming setup speaking of which I'll be
doing just that in an upcoming video so
stay tuned tiny little computer tons of
performance including a skull canyon
nook awesome Razer core thing
ah I don't have a link for you because
I've done it yet but it will happen so
stay tuned I fix it calm is your
