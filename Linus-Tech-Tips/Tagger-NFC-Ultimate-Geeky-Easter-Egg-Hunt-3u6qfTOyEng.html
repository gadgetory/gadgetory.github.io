aluminum stand for your smartphone that
even holds tablets up to eight inches
click now to learn more NFC for the
uninitiated stands for Near Field
Communication and is a wireless radio
communication standard that is designed
for very close-up and very power
efficient transmission of small amounts
of data integrated NFC readers are a
popular feature on Android and Windows
Phone smartphones and NFC tags can be
found on anything from movie posters to
trigger a trailer to play on YouTube to
food packaging to direct you to the
manufacturers website for nutritional
information and recipe suggestions and
as price continues to follow the
technology becomes more ubiquitous I
expect there will be all kinds of
innovative uses for it that we can't
even imagine right now but you don't
have to run around and find NFC tags
that contain useful functionality you
can actually buy your own here is just
such a device from tagger taggers near
wave-type one NFC tags are like any NFC
tag they're made up of a couple of key
components including a very small amount
of storage memory a radio chip and an
antenna all of which is possibly powered
which means they draw power from the
device reading them that means you can
put them almost anywhere unlike some
other NFC tags they're designed to be
applied unapplied bent creased and all
of that without invalidating your
warranty and they're covered on each
side by a waterproof PVC a protective
layer with a frustratingly strong 3m
adhesive on the backside that we learned
the hard way should probably only be
applied to surfaces that you don't ever
want to read your tag from Luke went and
stuck a couple of them together like way
to go Luke with that cautionary message
in mind you can stick them to almost
anything they do have some limitations
though we found that they only really
work very close up like almost touching
so make sure there's actually enough
clearance for you to get your phone next
to it and they also don't work on metal
surfaces unless you use an RF shield
they're a little bit on the big side at
three and a half centimetres squared but
given that you have to get your phone in
close to them I guess that last one is a
bit of a non-issue which leads us into
the big question here
you want to buy your own NFC tags what
can they be used for well with an app
like trigger which we highly recommend
you can set them up to do all kinds of
things here are some cool examples that
we came up with you can generate email
shopping lists when you're out of stuff
you can save grandma the frustration of
navigating menus on her phone to place
calls to loved ones you can set alarms
at bedtime create a digital business
card tap to enable bluetooth and start
music playback when you get in your car
then tap again and turn everything off
when you leave you can enable your Wi-Fi
hotspot so you can just put one on your
laptop boom ready to go you can check in
and out at home with a text message so
your parents don't worry you can mute
and dim the screen for school mode or
other custom phone modes that you set up
for yourself and you can even do things
like create a silent alarm to call 9-1-1
if you think you're in danger and so
much more but you guys aren't interested
in all that stuff you want to see
whether you can use NFC to do an easter
egg hunt
so rather than hiding real easter eggs
this is winner-takes-all whoever finds
all eight Easter eggs back there will
NFC tags and then uses NFC reader in
order to you know bloop go up against
them wins this solid chocolate bunny
best of luck best of luck may the best
man win
know you think we all know it'll be me
oh that's why you don't want the best
man to win yeah cuz that's me yeah well
I don't know whether to be that's not
very good trashed all right let's do
this thing
not it not it not it alright that's the
last one last one
I got where's the where's the fun of
doing alliances aids alteon or alliances
you just came from this way do you know
where Linus's where is he
show me go
in the house is in here line is - what
are you doing what did you even find any
of them I don't I don't want it now how
did you even manage get that all over
your face so I guess I won and I wanted
the chocolate bunny but I'm still going
to classify this a win because I'm not
that so I guess now is a good time to a
bank tagger NSC for sending us their
excellent NFC tags if we use to make
this fun little video about NFC you can
you can check them out online we'll put
a link in the video description so you
can see where to get them they're KD and
company so you know we're KD into that
kind of stuff not all comedians are like
