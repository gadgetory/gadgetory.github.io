managed this case a good dozen or two
times before this is actually a case
with which I am intimately familiar so
I'm pretty excited about the opportunity
to working it again in quite some time
now it does have two lists Bay's here
but they're not exactly the world's most
elegant system this I won't need so
we're just going to pry this up so this
is actually not the correct reading for
this piece so we're kind of creating our
own creds as we go Linus has to clean
out his entire PC to get started while
Luke only has three parts to pop in to
start overclocking we're not sure what
the outcome of this will be but we do
know it will be close
he just isn't cleaning his stuff because
he didn't find an advantage rag like I
did yes he advantage rags are not real
so Linus is obviously in a stage of
denial at the moment it wasn't real how
could I hold it in my hand having
already used his advantage drag the
Linus can be seen here using a box or
his underwear where we can try and
jury-rigged this well we can take this
off without damaging it without without
too much I think we should go for it I
think that were a little bit doing
research to see what this trip is trip
off see what this board is capable of to
hear them whispering as if that'll help
I mean the shopping stage is done Luke
so uh you know the fact that you have
crap Hardware no amount of keeping it
secret is gonna keep it secret forever
and then I'll tease you oh yeah I forgot
about that I'm sorry excuse I hope this
has a right notion okay
oh okay so these are a little lot
they're a little worse for the wear
right here
see there here's a little trick you just
give me the old that so here we can all
absolutely stuff right there I forgot
this
I don't have time for his shenanigans at
this point in the competition because
winners do not consorted own twin as
hard
I don't consort with them yeah that's
right shoot got it in there once
therefore I can do it again and that is
why I have two children yeah the only
one around here with proof of his
virility how do you know as your mother
would kill you ha ha you can fight
no no he's right my mom would kill me
you'd be dead yeah you'd actually be
dead
yep hmm did you bring out any zip ties
no but there might be some in the screw
bin'
that'll do it
a hi-yah
all that is a thing of beauty right
there
fantastic
oh I'm feeling good today
yeah then my mini wheats are like I ate
them I crapped them out I ate them again
I took a picture put it on Instagram
this was a real score like this was
probably worth a good chunk of the
budget right there along just nicely why
don't you get the hell out of here
spy we don't hate you over here we
accept your kind yeah losers are stuck
hanging out with the other losers this
is real good this is trustworthy that's
the difference between this and snakes
in the grass like Luke oh I should have
done this before I did the other thing
oh well I don't know if it's gonna reach
are you missing my epic struggle over
here no one yes oh yeah that table
management
all right all right now we did
specifically say that there would be
demerit points for leaving the garage
and I don't need to leave the garage but
I do need to walk over here so I'm
averting my eyes
berkel will Buerkle will hold this box
art Aaron is he still here okay well
someone someone will Buerkle will
supervise me here I got saved my
blinders yeah okay I got my blinders on
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo
this box right here is called the fun
box because there's a chair on top of it
for some reason see this is something
Luke wouldn't even think of needing
probably because I wouldn't need eggs
I'm not terrible
nice one of these uh yeah uh yeah let's
get like a moment there we go alright
see you got a system fired up over there
I hear keyboard strokes no not at all
I didn't finish installing all my
drivers like half an hour ago
oh what's that sound is that a hard
drive Oh interesting
oh ha I wouldn't know what a hard drive
sounds like I mean I'm all solid-state
over here man there we go
change to 3:45 Japanse we don't boot
fine okay
ah here's the moment we've all been
waiting for
mmm-hmm
um small problem I mean it's not a big
problem it's just a small one
okay oh yes oh yes we got this this is
good oh I don't think we have that you
don't wonder what we can get out of this
baby Wow it's been a really long time
we're not gonna quite go for that
know that
instead of aiming for like ultimate I
don't mean for like high want you want
to go ultimate yeah well that tells max
possible settings in every day that
tells me a lot about the other way you
waited your system I don't know how much
it'll show on screen but we can my
screen
oh wow this takes a while to load I
literally didn't even change anything
I opened afterburner and typed in a
number didn't press ENTER in the screen
with black oh all right
this is yeah there's nothing lets me
oh come on would you take care you take
your attempts Oh
I'll shut her down it looks like I might
need to dial back good luck no that's
two crashes I wasn't mentioned yet you
know you said that like it was a
horrible
don't worry minded go start yo my
computer's better under load it's like a
rotary engine I got to get up to a
certain rpm before I do chicken stock I
might be blaming you for this and what
happened I did nothing
whenever I open executables the screen
goes black I was working this last night
biggest fun I haven't touched it unless
I came back here in the middle of the
night
I've been supervise the entire time I've
been here all right so this has an FPS
counter on it I guess
we're gonna see my score so you might as
well check it out
Oh dad artifacting does that count
against me they don't know I don't know
I think that's just frankly I can't tell
oh no there's some dough okay alright I
think I think we have to call this one
off okay all right
seriously seriously let's just load up
three mark here well I think I know
something about his system I'm fairly
sure that's a reference cooler that is a
sound I've heard before it has a
particular tonality to it
that doesn't seem it's not running in a
full happy alright so
oh I was your to please hats looking
tired
we're doing fancy damage right again you
still have to run the actual games don't
be too smug this is a graphics benchmark
I'm just happy I won one of them
by like a lot like two times was that
cuz I have that backwards and then it
goes about two times
oh yeah has a crash unless your FPS is
uh 1600 it's just 1920 200 and Counting
2600 and Counting do you see do you see
this clear glitching so we're 100 times
glitch exploit we don't know I'm trying
to get to 200 times you see in a couple
seconds here all right why don't you go
ahead and shut that down and I'll take a
run at this
this is the physics test yeah you didn't
know there was a physics test inside us
so 58 66 is the mark to beat the first
successful run
I'm still higher it's not as higher
still higher the had a hard drive is
horrible like everything is kind of
working properly I didn't did it start
walking though I feel like it started
walking because remember yeah it was
counting FPS with my sinus
there's no Terrans but look at the
science oh it's coming back area not
nearly as much them
I have no I'm not saying a deduction for
all right here we go physics test oh
dear so what were you getting here 17 or
something oh that is Darrell all that
let's suppose you know what you're
oh now it's tired for calling teach
again oh ha ha ha
58 66 honey
what have you gotten 57 45 oh all right
what the hell is this yeah just run it
just run it in a bowl and I'll go on
little situps
for that's appropriate whoa
average FPS 66.6 minimum forty six point
nine six that's a pretty respectable
minimum I don't know how bottlenecks are
gonna be there I'm guessing 73 73 you're
gonna get you know I'm gonna guess
minimum 58 yeah I'm not gonna oh oh son
son who just got wrecked
okay so here's Lupe's results min 39
average sixty three point three
here's minuses results min 56 whoa ever
JT two point one all right oh wow ensure
swift victory with Corsairs highly
responsive lightweight Gaming Mouse the
Sabre RGB click now to learn more I
originally thought you had a 7950 now
I'm pretty sure you have a 7970 which
means you spent about half of your
budget on your graphics card I think I
know for sure you have it wrong
I know for sure you have a dual-core CPU
because usually because you got
absolutely destroyed you must have ddr2
and I think you've got 4 gigs of RAM you
how did you get it - nah the the thing
that's gonna blow your mind though I
have a q6600 is right Oh words yeah and
that that ram and the dual core I think
would you'll cause a little bit but I
don't think you were gonna come out with
the core core yeah I got a quiet or what
I gotta clubs for so really the big
winner the big winner would have been
probably a combination of the two they
could get a 290 @q sixty six hundred
eight gigs of ram a good quality power
supply an aluminium fronted case if we
took my card out of my system and put it
in here which is what that would have
been yeah that would be a pretty sick
machine for three hundred eighty bucks
and that's still cheaper than all the
consoles we looked at you could still
buy one or two games to equal the
console price I mean I think for $300 if
you can build a rig like this then guys
like bear is at the you know it's funny
and I guess we'll make this the
conclusion for this we get this a lot
where people criticize us for focusing
really on the high-end stuff and and the
brands that make the most sense at the
high-end and they ask us well why is
that there's such great value stuff out
there on the low end and the answer is
that if either of us we're going to
build a $500 machine
do something like this we would do this
we wouldn't be buying new that was on
exactly I did for the guy who's trying
to find one that I can get which
shouldn't be that cheap and then I would
have not rush purchased that setup
because it came with a terrible
motherboard because if you're smart and
you're a good shopper both of us were
doing this at the same time with only 48
hours to turn around all of these deals
not even we realistically only had seven
or eight hours to contact people and
pick up and let go get them yeah we
ended up with machines that we could
easily resell for more than what we paid
and to match this performance buying new
from the store would cost at least 50%
more or more so there you go guys used
hardware good value this was fun but you
got rekt I did you got rekt silent that
quad-core man quad-core is pretty so
thanks for watching guys this has been
the very first round of scrapyard wars
we have lots of great ideas coming for
this series let us know in the comments
if you want to see more let us know how
you liked the format it's a little
different than anything else we've done
don't forget to subscribe and we'll see
