liquid cooling a computer with the
cheapest parts we could find be they
from eBay or the local hardware store
but the problem always comes back to
this building a loop with parts designed
for something else like say using an
aquarium pump is pretty jank so we
endeavored to track down some parts that
are actually designed for cooling pcs
but are as inexpensive as the non
purpose-built stuff and thanks to the
power of Aliexpress they are finally
here and a total mess
Origin PC offers beautiful custom
desktops and laptops such as their evil
15 s that weighs only 4.3 pounds and is
under an inch thick featuring smooth 144
Hertz 1080p or 4k displays in an NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1070 max Q be sure to check
them out at the link below the first
step on our journey was of course to
source the parts and because of that the
surprises actually started early on I
mean little did I know that there is a
massive market of off-brand water
cooling gear like brands I've never
heard of like sis cooling and Barrow and
my to fame and some of it surprisingly
actually looks pretty legit
so naturally we did what any sane person
would do and ordered a freaking wack ton
of it like a whole bunch of them
including a few parts that I would
describe as decent looking and a few
that were not so much just sort of like
a like a Auto shoddy approach you know
fire at the wall and see what sticks so
once we had everything on order I
figured yeah okay probably like a month
for free delivery on a boat from China
right wrong so we actually ordered most
of the parts back in September of 2017
and the last one arrived in January of
this year so needless to say that was
quite the setback while we waited we
also ended up buying a couple more odds
and ends like which radiators are you
talking about these radiators like these
radiators and a couple of pumps so
that's why it has taken us until July
almost an entire year to actually make
this video so like yay free
international shipping you get what you
pay for and what exactly is it that we
did get Jake like do I do I do I just
like go through this stuff yeah go holy
crap look at this thing so this is just
a copper plate a piece of plexi
a gasket that doesn't even seem to be
made of like any kind of smelly Abel
like soft materials just hard plastic
it's just a straight-up like flat piece
of copper on the bottom this one is
based on a very similar design if you
can call a flat piece of copper design
this one is almost the same this is the
same thing this is the same thing with a
different bracket this bracket is
stupider so I guess these guys are the
the engineers of the dunce class okay
all right
the postings on the internet they don't
give you that great of a description of
what you're getting these guys went to
school and this one actually looks not
bad too so these are both kind of pin or
a style blocks that again are based on
very similar design so they are
Direction agnostic they just go in pass
through some fins and then come out so
is that all the CPU blocks oh yeah okay
let's kind of this one looks palling how
much was this I think it's like 15 bucks
15 bucks it's cheap Wow
I mean I'm not including these ek so of
course right but like that's not a
performance nickel-plated these pumps
look pretty friggin sketch though like
look at this thing it's got some weight
to it so I can give it that but I don't
know that that's necessarily meaning so
like these two are basically the same
just a different table you see this a
lot when you order stuff from China
where this is the same company it's like
designs that are clearly you know
borrowing from each other or straight-up
produced at the same factory and then
just rebranded with like Chinese
companies rebranding Chinese products in
the same way that like international
companies just rebrand Chinese products
so it turns out these radiators are
actually aluminum ok so heads up for you
guys you don't want to mix metals
aluminum plus copper equals corrosion
but the good news is that we did follow
up the aluminum radiator orders like
sometimes when you're ordering stuff
from China you don't even know exactly
what it is like one of the one thing we
thought was a block is just a red LED to
go in a block so you can get copper and
brass radiators with just aluminum fins
that don't cut touch the water for like
five bucks more even if you're going the
aliexpress water cooling route spend the
extra five bucks now one thing you might
notice that we didn't order any of is
fittings and reservoirs and the reason
for that is that while there are some
really cheap options out there they
don't affect performance so using them
in this kind of a test where we're
evaluating the performance serves no
purpose other than to have more
potential points of failure where we can
leak water onto our hardware so we just
stuck with the stuff that really affects
performance like this LED that how much
should we pay for this like it was like
five bucks five bucks but then given
that we probably paid about five bucks
for this it's really it's a nice one so
you can actually stick so this is just
LEDs for this blocks yeah I've seen this
kind of thing before probably worth the
five bucks yeah not bad enough fun and
haul videos for now though we need to
actually test these things but before we
can do that we need something to compare
our numbers against some kind of
standard luckily Jake keeps his test
bench water cold for some reason so we
can just use that this is actually a
pretty standard set up from one of the
best in the biz EK water blocks so to
cool the four gigahertz 59 60 X we've
got any case supremacy Evo mated to a
three hundred and sixty millimeter PE
series radiator and a d5 PWM pump and
we're gonna crank that pump to a hundred
percent for the purposes of this test
now with the baseline test out of the
way it's time to take some of our
aliexpress wonders for a's
Finn now we're gonna assume that if
you're buying some parts super cheap
from Aliexpress you're probably buying
most of them there so because of that
we're gonna build the whole loop out of
these parts
the only ek stuff we're using again
reminder is the reservoir and the
fittings so what do you wanna start with
you know I was thinking I really want to
try one of these just like gross box
sure but are we gonna say match for the
pine axe yeah I think we should get like
a proper do you want to do like the
really I'll just okay okay I do like a
baseline of our aliexpress though sure
yeah okay I don't think you should
probably buy this but you can this is
actually cut like have you taken this
apart and put it back together or
something because this is like not an
amazing design actually from everything
that I know about water yeah and it
needs like a jet plate while Jake builds
up our first Le Express loop let's talk
pricing that ek config that we showed
first with everything included would
cost you a whopping three hundred and
eighty dollars I know that sounds like a
lot but for custom water cooling that's
not actually that outlandish now with
that said what Jake's building right now
is around ninety dollars including
everything that you need about a quarter
as much okay so this is it we're on the
full aliexpress loop yeah at the Express
loop it sounds like a train or something
the aliexpress loop with the SIS cooling
SCP sixty-seven F which Jake found was
pretty much the best bang for the buck
and he had I 264 s FPU test running for
about 20 minutes to give it a chance to
reach equilibrium and we're sitting at
about 65 degrees on average pretty darn
impressive for the price really honestly
not that far off our ek setup okay now I
want to see the worst case scenario what
happens when we throw this gutter trash
okay it's the same thing this gutter
trash alright find out my favorite type
of trash so it's done Luke number two is
set up using one of those completely
flat blocks now our X
spectators for this thing pretty freakin
low most water blocks have channels cut
or like machined or something into the
base to increase their surface area
because more surface area means more
heat transfer so we would think
something with negligible surface area
by comparison would perform very poorly
and now that it's been running for about
20 minutes on a 59 60 X it's actually
doing okay like way way better than I
expected so conclusion time then custom
water cooling has really evolved from
the days of like basement scientists
with their aquarium pumps and like you
know weird hunks of metal that they got
from like someone that one guy in
Australia that makes them and ships them
around the world or whatever to having
tons of options I mean everything from
you know super high-end stuff that would
scare away most newcomers just due to
the sheer cost all the way down to
thanks to the power of Chinese
manufacturing and free international
shipping low-end options where you can
actually get reasonable performance and
that coolness factor for about what you
would pay for an AIO from a name-brand
with that said the performance of your
AIO that would come with a warranty or
even a high-end Noctua air cooler that
would also come with a warranty would
also be pretty good so doing a build
like this super cool was definitely fun
to experiment I'm just not sure if we're
gonna put the - tech tips seal of
approval especially on the pumps please
don't cheap out on your pump not
recommended it's not that bad guy I
don't recommend it okay never recommend
it well this thing with id5 nothing else
DDC nothing else is acceptable no
I've seen so many TV C's filming where's
my d5 what about this thing didn't I
give this to someone at LTX last night
crisis like tomorrow look I fixed it I
welded it lordy
master op is back with another deal this
time on the Sennheiser open-back HD v 8x
jubilee headphones these were tuned by
Axel Braille met him super cool for like
an engineering a German dude by the way
of Sennheiser and mass drop based on
feedback from the community they feature
new 150 ohm drivers and a colorway
inspired by the HD 5 80s they're clear
fast with a dynamic sound profile and
they've got a glossy black headband
