to be that when you were shopping for a
power supply you could basically judge
the quality by the weight the heavier
the power supply the better it probably
was that is until some cheapo
manufacturers started literally putting
hunks of metal in them to make them seem
better that got us thinking what about
hunks of metal could you literally walk
down the cooling aisle with a luggage
scale and buy the heatsink with the best
price to weight ratio to cool your CPU
maybe gee skills km 780 our mechanical
keyboard features a brushed aluminum top
plate on the fly Mac for recording and
various Cherry MX key switch
configurations learn more at the link
below we know more weight or mass if you
want to be pedantic about it does not
mean better cooling a 2 kilogram block
of aluminum on top of a CPU would weigh
a lot but wouldn't do a good job of
cooling it down for long so what you're
actually after when it comes to
dissipating heat is surface area the
more surface area that you have the more
cooling will be available so then if we
assume that most commercial CPU coolers
are designed by mechanical engineers and
not by chimpanzees and that most
companies are interested in saving cost
while optimizing performance then it
would make sense that most heat sinks
out there represent the manufacturers
best efforts to strike a balance between
material cost and heat dissipation so
assuming that everyone has done their
homework equally the heavier the cooler
the higher the performance should be but
as we know so very well around here not
all engineering is a
so we grabbed a bunch of coolers off the
shelf and devised a test the weight of
each cooler was recorded with the fan
but without mounting hardware we kept
the room at a consistent 24 degrees
Celsius and set the fan curve to full
speed on our system for all of our tests
the cpu we used was a core i7 7700 k
with the i-264 FPU test running for 30
minutes before the average package temp
was taken for the next five and looking
at their results there are actually some
very interesting takeaways here first of
all the NHD 15's our performance of
every a i/o liquid cooler is a great
testament to how well engineered it is
and while we're praising strong products
for their efficiency Corsairs dual 140
millimeter AIO outperforms the
Thermaltake triple 120 AIO which has
worse case compatibility if I had to
hazard a guess here though I'd say that
this is down to the similar surface area
of these two layouts and the design of
the fans the most striking thing about
these results though is that after a
weight of about 400 grams the heat
transfer to weight ratio absolutely
plummets with the coolers that removed
the most heat per gram being the
lightest ones why is this well getting
finally into the purpose of making this
video to let Alex nerd out for a bit
it's actually because of a design
concept called the infinite fin
approximation basically for a thin of
similar thickness material and airflow
it can only get so long that is to say
the distance from the heat source before
adding more material is basically a
waste
this concept is illustrated using this
graph where the y axis represents heat
flow one would be all of it and zero
would be none so for an infinitely small
fin you would
to pay zero heat that makes sense and
for a mile-long Finn I mean by the tip
of it practically all of the heat from
the source would have been dissipated to
the air before it could possibly be
conducted there that is why in the early
2000s CPU coolers transitioned from Finn
or flour based designs to the heat pipe
ones of the late 2000s and the liquid
cooling designs that are common today so
newer CPUs generated more heat but they
didn't get any bigger so there was no
point in making the fins longer which
means that these new high conductivity
fluid based mediums heat pipes and water
helped solve the challenge of moving the
heat away to lengths optimized fins
elsewhere is this something that we can
show happening in real life actually yes
the easiest way is by using this FLIR
one thermal camera looking at the Noctua
Nhu 12s the ends of the fins come in at
about 38 degrees Celsius 14 degrees
above the temperature of the room
whereas on the massive NHD 15 the fins
are only about 31 degrees Celsius and
remember the lower the difference in
temperature the slower the heat transfer
so with a given heat load these longer
fins are cooler and therefore are
dissipating less heat per amount of
material bringing us then finally back
to our original question can you judge a
coolers performance by its weight well
actually it turns out you kind of can
surely there are some exceptions out
there and some did better than others
but everything we tested seems to have
had some engineering thought put into it
so that's good to know
we are working with Rosewill to give
away nine that's right nine of them
Nebula series gaming headphones they've
got the GX 10
30 and G X 50 models the GX 10 features
leather at ear cup cushions bright blue
LED backlighting around the ear cups and
compatibility with most devices not to
mention a $25 price tag
while the GX 30 and 50 both have
detachable microphones as well as RGB
lighting but the GX 50 has 7.1 virtual
surround so the GX 30 is 35 and the GX
50 is 45 to purchase at the links below
oh and also linked below is the link for
the giveaway 9 chances to win go check
it out thanks for watching guys that
this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button or check out the link
to where to buy a cooler in the video
