hear on Linus tech tips today I'll be
showing you how to optimize your drive
setup if you're rocking a separate SSD
and hard drive using one of each kind of
drive in your rig has become a very
popular option for people that want to
keep their operating system and their
frequently used programs such as their
favorite games on their quick SSD and
data such as videos photos music and
their massive Steam libraries on the
slower mechanical hard drive to keep it
all safe if something happens to your
operating system installation and to
keep the cost of storage down
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link below
if you're doing an initial Windows
installation on a new computer blank
drives should each show up as their own
individual entries in the where do you
want to install Windows list format your
drives by clicking new and using the
default settings for each Drive then
select your SSD as the Windows
installation location by clicking it so
that it is highlighted then clicking
next if you're not sure which is which
you should easily be able to identify
your SSD by its capacity if you've
already got your computer up and running
and you're installing a fresh hard drive
it may not show up automatically in File
Explorer if this is the case do not
worry just right-click on the start
button and select disk management from
there you'll be able to see your new
drive as unallocated space simply
right-click and choose new simple volume
use the default settings pick whatever
Drive letter and label you would like so
you can identify it easily then click
finish and your new drive should be
ready to go in a few seconds now we're
going to configure Windows to send data
automatically to your hard drive so that
your SSD won't fill up with stuff that
you don't want on it
when you open a file explorer window
those options on the left side for
documents downloads music pictures and
videos map to specific locations on your
computer so what you'll want to do is
create new folders for your data on your
new drive then right click on the
appropriate shortcut and File Explorer
for the folder that you just created for
one of those previously mentioned
directories then just enter the
directory you created on your new drive
where you want your files to go this
will change the default save directory
in various programs to the new folders
on your data drive but what about games
if you're using steam as many people are
these days many games will store their
save files in a subfolder in your
documents directory in which case you
won't have to do anything else outside
of the previously mentioned steps but
some use random save locations if you
just want to ensure everything gets
saved to your data drive to keep
everything game-related separated from
your operating system it's not a bad
idea to just
all steam itself and your games to your
data drive even though most games these
days use cloud saves anyways you could
also install individual games to more
specific locations by going to Steam
clicking on downloads then steam library
folders from there you can create a
folder on whatever drive you'd like and
then you can choose to install any
feature games you would download to that
location of course if you want to keep
certain games on your SSD for fast load
times you can still do this by simply
selecting a folder on your SSD during
installation and vice versa follow these
steps and you'll be able to enjoy a more
robust system for managing your files
and programs to keep things both safe
and efficient by leveraging both of your
drives Tesoro is giving away two grams
