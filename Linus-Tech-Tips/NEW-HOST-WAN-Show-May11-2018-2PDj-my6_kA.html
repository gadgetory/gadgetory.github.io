the wine show how's it going how was
your week how was your week
it's the Northshore that's the Naja lion
buddy not about that I'm sorry
we're in bizarro land yes game went by
that went by faster I guess I think of
having really poor short-term memory
helps because you Monday people what do
people would you do this weekend yeah
something not very novel apparently
write read books we have an interesting
show today though if you're if your
weekend went by kind of quickly and
wasn't interesting as well maybe this
will be an interesting cap to the end of
the rest of the week we're talking about
people not knowing that they're talking
to a I yes is a surprising amount of
sophistication from Google duplex but
we'll talk about little blue everyone's
collective mind at their i/o conference
earlier this week and we're also gonna
talk about Boston Dynamics he's kicking
ass on the other part of robot futures
yeah embodied part oh my put them
together and it can talk and move also
Nintendo has shared some details about
its switch online service which is
Coolio and rumors about the iPhone 10
plus sized version of the future this
fall the big one the big 10 I thought it
was already pretty big no we'll talk
about that okay I'm not really into the
whatever that's fine can you see his
feet when using the boat what he's in
the boat yeah okay what's up what again
no not refined of that no one leg you
can you can see is yeah you can see the
Sun it's light you can see his feet
though you can they're one of the best
like Mario is super annoyed that's my
best sound I can do that's pretty
my I really wish I could do the tube
spectrum yeah stop is jerky and - isn't
here haha also gonna eat all the maple
bacon fresh but just reset this thanks
ba and then go back to here yes we're
bad it how's it going everyone I'm not
the twitch at open which makes you feel
strange I'm gonna fix that you want to
let's just get right into Google
duplexes I think that was the coolest
thing I've seen at least all year I
think okay let's just assume that no
one's our sources and SC to Mitch on the
forum is a SC to image yeah yes and I
assume that stands for Starcraft you
I've just obviously I'm gonna go with it
I like it I feel like I've I've I've
been told what it's stood for before but
I don't remember but I'm gonna go with
Starcraft yeah yeah anyways I will never
trust anyone on the phone that goes
uh-huh mmhmm that's it yeah yeah mmm-hmm
so at Google i/o which is their
conference every year for developers as
opposed to the made by Google Hardware
event in the mall which is for consumer
products at Google i/o this week they
were showing off all the new feature
tech that they're doing it's it's way
beyond Android now and one of the things
they showed is a future service that's
gonna be rolling out later this year
that they call what the hell why does
something weird happen like out there
every time we're on this thing to us
yeah they're calling it Google duplex
and the idea here is that in the future
Google's gonna help you get stuff done
that's the Google assistants job and one
of those things that you need to get
done a lot of the time is making a phone
call to book reservations at a
restaurant or book a hair appointment or
something like that and these are the
two examples they showed so sundar puts
up on the screen behind him a real
recording of a real call I don't expect
that they did hundreds or thousands of
these calls and they probably cherry
picked and it seemed like there was the
the person that picked up the phone was
the same person on like a few of them
that I heard oh there's more than just
the two he demoed there's more calls you
can listen to I think I heard three but
I could be really not remembering
accurately again we've got a similar
short term memory loss situation at
least two for sure I heard one where it
was a guy calling in yeah
to a Chinese girl calling in to
something at her appointment yeah those
are the ones alone for my client yeah
that's what a demo okay yeah yeah so on
the screen we just see kind of a
visualization of a phone call you get a
little the Google assistant logo
representing the robot or the AI and
then just like a phone logo representing
the person and the person answers a
phone and says you know this is the hair
salon how can I help you and then you
hear this impeccably human sounding
voice on the other side saying hey I'm
calling on behalf of a client and I'm
looking to book a hair appointment and
then a conversation ensues and the
result of which is my hair point is
booked and then I guess the users phone
would receive a notification that says
you have got a hair appointment so you
can just be like hey assistant booked me
a hair appointment at this place
for this time or between this time
between 10:00 and 12:00 on Friday and
then a few minutes later you're gonna
get notifications yep that's done yeah
someone in chat said Luke is skeptical
as usual I think it will work as
advertised service people stick to a
script I am skeptical but I think it
will usually work because of what you
just said yeah usually when you're
calling into a restaurant there's a
fairly formulaic way right you would
book a reservation that is absolutely
true right it's not even necessarily
that they stick to a script it's just
there's fairly basic and for me
information that needs to be passed back
and forth and it's not that complicated
to first that's right so that kind of
that kind of feeds into how the voice
sounds because it sounds really
realistic
it sounds more realistic than a Google
assistant voice it even sounds more
realistic than the Google assistant
voice using wavenet which is another
thing they announced at i/o wavenet
which was a system that was outlined in
a paper by google's deepmind like 18
months it was finally being integrated
into the Google assistants so this is
just taking in raw waveforms and and
making your phonemes based on that it
makes the google assistants voice way
better they demoed that and it still
wasn't as good as what we hear on duplex
which makes me think that what we hear
on duplex for the most part is
pre-recorded sound bytes you can hear it
sounds a little inhuman when they say
numbers and dates and times because
that's kind of lately that's kind of
turnkey they plug that in
but the reason they would be able to use
pre-recorded sound bites is because the
possible set of interactions is much
decreased when you're in this kind of
scenario where like you just need to do
this one thing and a lot of it is like
let me check that for you or would you
mind going on hold for a second or
something like that where you just need
to like confirm so the amount of times
that's why I keep on saying that mm-hmm
thing because the amount of time and
that's all you really need to say on the
phone and that's often all you really
say on the phone but the amount of time
the amount of times that the AI says it
and does it very believing ly very
believably believable you got uh and
like it's it's it's really good the one
thing that I noticed was there's like a
flight delay like a little bit more than
I feel like most people would take
before they say something but not very
much and I think to counteract that like
they programmed in some delay like when
you answer the phone and say hello they
program in a wait a because no one just
goes hallo ho yeah yeah I'm wait a
second right and I might have been paid
I might have been trying to look for it
they also programmed in um yeah I mean
it there's gonna be some processing time
too right yeah really cool so the reason
that they can do that is because when I
talking to my Google assistant I could
say anything to it and it has to be able
to respond but as this user on twitch
says in this situation not only is the
computer basically performing a script a
narrow set of actions of possible
actions but so is a human because the
human on the other hand is just trying
to get some basic information from you
someone's calling in what time do they
want to come how many people it was
complain about the contrast I'm trying
to fix it but I'm really bad I like that
it's like an Instagram filter I'm really
bad at doing anything related to this at
all
so how brittle do you think this system
is gonna be when it launches that's
everyone's first complaint like what if
someone just says enjoying the weather
we're having and it doesn't know what
that means yeah like if they need to do
something that's trying to carry on
small talk yeah honestly there might be
some stuff set in I wouldn't be too
surprised if there's some stuff set in
too like basically cut those kind
stations off by just using the mm-hmm
yeah enjoying the weather we're having
mm-hmm well another difference is that
during the demo the assistant never
announces itself as such it never says
hey you're talking to a robot and a lot
of people got pretty angry about that
but Google has since the demo promised
that when it rolls out it will announce
itself as as a virtual assistant so then
you're not even gonna have those
problems because of it
you know you're talking to a person but
you're not just gonna hang up like you
were me might when we answer our phone
and there's a robot there because it's
business and you don't want to lose that
business you want that appointment to
get most well most businesses probably
wouldn't hang out yeah I know I I
completely agree because you want the
business but I think it's I think it's I
didn't know that it was gonna announce
that's a new development okay because I
feel like now if I was a business if I
had a text version I would just want
that oh you mean like if there's just an
online web form yeah yeah I would rather
that Google just filled that out well
well you would have to pay for that
though you have to build that that
booking system where is over sure but
there's a lot of like open table for
restaurants yeah there's open table
there's like a lot of different services
like this have services out there that
work with them to pair that together now
I don't know if opentable like takes
something I can't see how they could
take a cut but like I'm sure there's
some benefit there you might have to pay
them to be on it or there's ads or
something I have no idea there's another
angle with the virtual assistant
announcing itself which is eavesdropping
laws so when at least a dozen states
there's laws because it's not it doesn't
have ears like you and me it's not
hearing the conversation it means to
actually record the conversation and
because the you're recording the
conversation there's states where every
party on the in the conversation each
party has to consent to it being
recorded so either has to say this is a
virtual assistant can I record this or
maybe it can get away with just
announcing this is being recorded and if
you don't hang up you can send out
another particular laws for each state I
feel like that
could work just you know this call is
being recorded please hang up if you
don't want it to be
yeah but then or maybe you you you would
have already started recording so I
think you already broke the law so you'd
have to be like this call will be
recorded in however much time please
hang I don't know I don't know that's
weird
maybe they just won't let it well it
doesn't no it doesn't necessarily have
to have begun recording yet they can
just say that script before it starts
hearing that's what I was saying yeah so
they might have to delay when it starts
recording right this call will be
recorded in X amount of seconds hang up
if you don't want it to be again start
the conversation I don't know how to fix
this for you guys I'm sorry I don't know
camera stuff I've slightly moved all the
dials I went down and people hated it I
went up and people hated it
I don't know I'm sorry some camera
person I'll have to fix it eventually I
don't know why when Cho gets screwed up
every week but it does we had way more
lights this time for the demo when they
when the virtual assistant was calling
all these people when they're collecting
this data and they're doing on like
their test runs they did presumably
hundreds of these calls I think this is
kind of like it might go down in the
history books because when what other
time like if we live in a future where
there's a eyes that look like us and
think like us and are better than us
you're gonna be able to look back in
time and point to a scenario where yep
that was the first time that a human
didn't know they were talking to an AI
yeah cuz no one leaked this no one was
like I think a computer called me like I
never saw an article about that
you don't like they didn't know yes they
talked to in the hung up I mean there's
been chat BOTS people could be talking
to chat BOTS yeah there's the Turing
test which again is chat based not yeah
audio base yeah but even in the Turing
test the the participants they know that
one of the conference the one of the
conversations are gonna be having is
gonna have an AI so like they're looking
out for it yeah pretty cool and the
Turing test could be used with chat with
vocal chat in mind just be adapted for
like I know it's a specific it hasn't
been conducted like that though yeah I
know but like it could be you could be
adapted there's lots of ways to adapt
the imitation game because it's actually
not that great of a test that anyway
yeah let's disco right Boston Dinah I
think it's very cool I don't want to
like play the audio in stream so I don't
know how well it's gonna come out and
all that kind of stuff but if you guys
haven't heard of it before now I would
definitely look up Google duplex and
listen to the calls
cuz it's way more interesting than it
probably seems in fact if you have its I
mean when you're on YouTube it looks
like the video is three hours long but
if you have it's probably only an hour
and a half and if you have that time I
would say watch all of IO there is a lot
of car belong to I there's a lot of cool
stuff and they're not just duplex duplex
was definitely the coolest FET before
the end of this weekend I will have seen
the whole thing that's all you have you
seen the bit with lens no oh that's so
crazy I've had almost no time I've been
super slammed is because now that
they've got such good image recognition
they're getting closer to Google's
endgame goal which was informations
coming at you without you needing to
query it with like you're walking down
the street let's say you have some cool
glasses and you just look at a building
the image recognition knows that that
building is the Washington Monument and
then the card comes up with the
information about it it looks so awesome
and it's it's integrate with the AR kit
so it's like a nice distance away from
you like this nice depth oh yeah so it's
not just a window that comes up here
it's like anchored to in space right
it's so sweet that's cool okay so now we
have this well the source is Linus's
email thank you very much linus is email
and Linus wants to talk about this one
he does oh that's why he send it to me
why does he care I don't know I mean you
can just do it no that's fine sniper
there's another Nintendo one we can do I
also don't with this one no that's
another Linus one okay the
I don't care what we talk about I'm
freakin down I want to talk about Boston
Dynamics shirts because we're onto this
robot like kind of kick right now yeah
so this again was se to miss you posted
it in the forum oh dude Boston Dynamics
they're amazing they make bewildering
robots like new backflips and stuff they
have a kick-ass use of the channel you
saw the door opening wound right yeah
already holds Oh it holds the door open
for the other one to walk through go to
their YouTube channel it's so cool every
few months they upload a new video of
what what the progress they've made and
two days ago they did that they have
plated
two new videos one shows the Atlas robot
can we play it yeah we don't need audio
or anything no yeah this is I want to
put this I'm gonna make this into a gif
and put it on my Twitter and pin it this
is so inspiring
oh no here we go it's grammerly look at
that bang doodoo uneven ground grass
variable friction yes - I want the rocky
theme in the background yes I want to go
up I wish he raised his arms up he does
that in the back that video it oh yeah
yeah I know that makes sense yeah yeah
that is to run I know kids who can't run
that's amazing that the only thing is in
most of their videos when they have one
of the robots walking around somebody
kicks it or pushes it with a hockey
stick or something and they don't get
that in this video and I would assume
that's because it can't take it yet if
they could take it they'd show it yeah
it also looks like those are what do you
call this linear hips oh yeah so if they
hit the side it'll probably just tip
over oh I see yeah give me a figure
eight here but at the same time it might
be able to the arms aren't so they'll be
all the teach the kids you off buddy
just play that again and again this is a
jump I just want to make sounds now
you're doing
I love you can make that noise I've
never heard anyone do that before I
really wish I could do that going down a
tube sound not even I don't know the
human yeah yeah I can't even possibly
the only reason why I went to choose so
people would know what we were even
talking about that's yeah bad I want to
see that robot Duke a football player oh
you know like go this way and spin or
something yeah that'll be epic so you
wouldn't need it would need
multi-directional hips you're right cuz
just doing this yeah
so the second video that they uploaded
was their spot mini which is the smaller
quadrupeds like one it's the one that
you might have seen videos where it has
a weird arm slash head slash whatever
you want to call it that opens doors and
recycles cans in this video it doesn't
have that instead it has this extra
little modular on the on the back this
white box and what you're watching is
this thing navigate itself it's kind of
self driving right now you know it has a
route that I believe it's trying to do
and it's it's just moving through space
if you click forward in the video
they'll actually put a render on the
side of the screen to show you the data
that it's seen yeah there we go
so reading up if you look at the
description of the YouTube video what a
queue says is it's not inherit it's not
going through this as a novel situation
they've actually manually piloted the
robot through this area first to teach
it we're going to map it and then it
goes through on its own after that which
is still useful I mean if your honor
it's not trying to I don't think yes but
I don't think he's trying to follow so
some people might think like okay I've
done this one so it's gonna do like
exactly step by step I think he's trying
to go to the same destination correct
but it's still like alert like they
could have put a box in the way or
something and it would be able to deal
with that's right it's not on like a set
path yeah it's just going through a
known so it's like they gave it a map
but like it's still hard to get there
which I mean self-driving cars do have
that yeah yep I just wanted to clarify
too something yeah
yeah that's pretty sweet I mean the fact
that it has to drive through first it
seems like it would limit the
applications if you're thinking about
like a conflict zone then you know
you're not gonna be able to bring this
thing at first but maybe you could drop
fly in small drone first or use a
different type of robot - or a different
type of vehicle to map the area it's
also this is also completely autonomous
navigation so like if you're bringing in
another robot you could like you could
use this as some sort of like patrol or
to check your own areas or something
like that and have manually controlled
things to check out areas that you
haven't seen before right go back to the
part where it's on the stairs there's
actually something you'll notice when it
gets to the top of the stairs and it
wants to turn around again so if you
think we're looking at it - but right
now right now skip ahead just a bird
like its face right so it gets to the
top now I wants to go back it wants to
go down and see how it turned around
it's like its legs are optimized for
kind of oh no relative to what we were
looking at before it's it was kind of
going backwards down those stairs yeah
is he gonna yeah so he always wants that
end to be lower face down ass up I guess
it's got those grasshopper legs yeah I
want to see this thing jump did you see
that other one they have that's on
wheels around it it could jump like yeah
Peter something up the thing was crazy I
love that thing I don't know the name of
that one but so badass these guys are
the best those it's like murdered
friends did you see that mangled that
one is like oh okay too many hockey
sticks why so okay I read that and I was
googling about it and then I was I came
across this other articles like hold up
stop the press spot mini is gonna be on
sale next year in 2019 you're gonna be
able to buy one of those things so much
I didn't know it doesn't say they don't
say but I
think these things were gonna be for
sale to the general public like anytime
soon so it says I can't wait for the the
like the Casey nice that drone review of
this we gotta get one for sure no I'm
just saying like it just seems like the
kind of thing he would buy yeah I'd like
ride it around New York somehow I think
we should we shouldn't even do a
sponsored thing we should just outright
buy one so we can have it around all the
time I want to put my lunch on it and
like get it to carry it down the stairs
for me and stuff you can get it we want
to get an imagined to rig a camera into
it we use my different attachments yeah
and you know have you ever seen it do
the chicken head thing or it can move
its body but the the head oh they
doesn't want one position so we could do
that with it's like a basically a gimbal
that would be cool we don't need to hide
you know that video where we were saying
we're hangin another shooter we're not
we're just gonna wait it out spot many
we're just getting a spot many to walk
around things awesome last 90 minutes
it's all electric obviously it's
wireless you're probably not gonna buy
one when they come out they're probably
gonna be stupid expensive probably give
me tens of thousands of dollars yeah and
not really for you yet although it will
be probably for governments and PMC's
mostly it's gonna be a consumer product
eventually that's their hope couple
years after that so right now there are
ten spot many prototypes in existence I
guess not counting the murder ones and
they're hoping to make one like a total
of 100 by the end of this year and then
sell them next year so they think it'll
be useful for security patrols or
helping construction companies keep tabs
on what's happening at the building site
so security overnight okay and security
patrol pretty much and you can get
specialized attachments for different
types of jobs yeah I like the idea of it
auto following someone with a camera
that's cool paramilitary company what
would happen if you put a little roller
skates on each foot private just like
just like I you troll the normal dog
yeah putting socks on it I don't please
stop that's super cool though what else
you want
you want talk with this tickets thing
yes this is kind of a a low-tech thing
yeah but it's it's a problem that
plagues a lot of people that are
probably watching right now here's the
problem with tickets the thing there's a
big economic problem with with ticket
sales Freakonomics the podcast is a
sweet episode about this actually when
you go to buy concert tickets there the
price of those concert tickets actually
isn't driven by normal capitalist market
dynamics this is supposed to buy WM
groomed aka on the forum yeah who's a
baller and I like him even more now that
I know he's a nine inch nails fan like I
am because anyone who likes science
nails likes it a lot anyway when you
tickets are basically too cheap because
artists want all their fans to be able
to come and see them if they were priced
accordingly like just by supply and
demand they'd probably be a lot more
expensive and they are a lot more
expensive when people are able to scalp
them which they're able easily able to
do with plots and so in order to reduce
the number of bots scalping tickets the
band Nine Inch Nails or Trent Reznor has
made the decision on their upcoming tour
this fall to not sell any tickets online
at all they're going on at school you
have to go and line up and buy them and
you can't even line up overnight or
anything like that you can't line up
prior to 8:00 a.m. you have to just like
show up and it's like a mob of people
and then organize yourself in a line or
maybe even a lottery system they talked
about some venues maybe the the
employees just come out and go okay like
youuuu you're at the front and it's just
like random because just because they
don't sell online doesn't mean there
won't be scalpers right yeah scalpers
can just pay someone 20 bucks to stand
there there is a limit of 4 tickets per
person hopefully that will reduce the
scalping okay I don't think that will
completely solve it it won't but it'll
make a dent yeah it's it's it's
interesting this has been really
frustrating with like so my dad and my
group of friends have been going to PAX
Prime since I was like 14 or something
or 15 I don't remember we've been going
for a very long time when we first
started going you could walk up and go
to the desk
buy a ticket and walk in because there
oh wow
there wasn't enough fence and now for
pax west like pax prime as it I know it
they sell out in seconds and like they
do this crazy queueing thing and there's
limits per person and like they do IP
lock and like all this crazy stuff
doesn't matter completely gone
immediately and there's an insane amount
of scalping just outside of pax there's
like many people scalping stacks of
tickets every single year and there's an
insane amount of scalping online there
is a really nice community online where
there's a bunch of different communities
that sell them at cost okay because it's
like oh I bought too many my friend
can't go whatever that kind of stuff I
suspect those communities have a whole
bunch of people in them
yeah just buying them and scalping them
yeah but but I do know a lot of people
that have gotten tickets at cost that
needed them from those communities so it
is working to a certain degree so that's
cool but like it really sucks when me
and my friends who have been going since
pax was really small and like barely a
convention are now struggling to be able
to go even though we've been loyal this
whole time and it's just like ah man
that kind of sucks we still make it
every year we somehow make it but it's
just well you could always pay a bunch
more yeah we I don't think we've had to
do like oh we have to buy like two
single days or something that we've
never had to buy like entire sets of
tickets for every person from scalpers
we've never had to do that there are
other approaches rather than going from
the Stone Age and that have been
experimented with one of them is
basically kind of verified you buy your
ticket you pay for it but you don't
really have it until you show up with
your identification with the credit card
that bought the tickets then you're let
in and they print the tickets for you at
that time there's problems with that
though because you cut you want there to
be a secondary market you know you don't
you want to be able to buy them the week
before because you just found out or
like you're visiting that city yeah you
want to be able to buy online like nine
sales fans are diehards people travel I
won't snot a concert by the way I've
seen them five times one set of concert
eyes I was there
and there was a lady who had followed
them across Europe she'd seen them like
28 times she had a stack of picks for
tambourines
she got an autograph from him and then
got that autograph tattooed on her body
like she was insane people want to be
able to see oh they're not coming back
free but they're going to Seattle I'm
gonna buy a ticket for Seattle yeah but
I'm not gonna drive out there and get in
an online on the hopes that I can buy a
ticket and then drive out there again
for the show yeah there's really no like
great solution and it sucks I love the
quote here speaking of sucks
where does you say here we decided to
try something different that will also
likely suck but in a different way we're
hoping many of you will be happy with
results while some may do what they
always do in bitch about it yeah like
there's and there's no other way to say
it
he's trying something it's probably not
gonna completely it definitely won't
completely work I think I think for them
they're just gonna have to try to like
weigh the noise its trade-offs yeah and
just like see how much less or more
negative their new solution is it's not
they're never gonna have like a perfect
solution there was one other solution
that's been tried I believe I take a
master called verified fan you ever
heard of that no it's I believe they
take a certain number of tickets or
maybe certain sections and what you do
is you have to register like ahead of
time to kind of a community forum
that'll be on in this case ticketmasters
website where you have to do all these
different things that signal that you're
a true fan you've got to engage with so
many posts you've gotta like I think
that's basically it like you're on it's
like a process okay so to verify
yourself it's not just I login see that
that almost makes me kind of happy like
something that I've wanted from pax for
a long time is like okay so I've bought
tickets to PAX West for like 12 years
it would be nice if you knew that yeah
but so I think I'll go let me buy
another one they scan you in you know
yeah but then like maybe I have like a
profile and a scalpers could still do
this but I was gonna say like I sign in
at the event and I'm showing you like
yeah I'm showing up every day this is me
you can check me every time if you want
like make make some process that you can
go through that gives you some form of
elevated accountable even what you just
described would introduce quite a bit of
friction to scalpers because if you're
scrout scalping 10 tickets and then all
those people arrive at like the same
time and you can't wait in line 10
different times you might it would be
harder though whatever introduces more
friction and even the the waiting in
line 10 different times thing no like if
you have to verify it by ID and stuff
they wouldn't be able to they'd only be
able to scalp one set of tickets I
actually got screwed by that once I
bought we spent life or no I think was
560 bucks for Red Hot Chili Peppers
tickets for four of them and I bought
them on Craigslist and they were printed
out and they were black and white and
the guy was super sketch and we didn't
feel good about it so my buddy was also
texting the same person and after I
bought them he continued to text them
hey they're still available yeah they
sure are met up with him again and
busted them didn't end up at least we
got like some collateral from the guy
but he ended up just foregoing it like
he we were we got his phone and stuff
but he is because we were like we got
your phone now you have to like give us
a refund and he's like okay I go I'll go
get money out I'll come back
like tomorrow kind of thing and he never
did and the cops didn't care at all so
we just had his crappy phone after and
like and his debit card or something
like that you took his phone from okay I
wasn't there I was I happen to be
traveling I was but my friends who also
were part of this and who are also
larger than I am they confronted him and
like how to stakeout and stuff it was
cool but in the end basically the deal
is they could have sold these tickets a
dozen times and actually ours could have
worked if we were the first one to get
up yeah whoever gets there first and
gets his tickets scanned the rest are
inactive after that so that was a drag
what a guy it's just so junk I don't
like it when people when people pray on
like the average person in general but
it sucks too when someone's like so
excited for something and they're gonna
like they're gonna fork out the money
for this band
want to go see and they like yes I
finally get to see him in concert and
then they get like screwed at the door
and so bad that the person scanning
their ticket is probably like you're a
terrible person you know what I mean
and then you finally get in there you
okay that all sucked but we're here and
then the whole show is just actually
someone else doing this in front of you
holy kill yourselves
I don't be Aegis but young people are
getting pretty bad at that I've seen
people have watched people just like
just continually hold the button down
and contribute each one to their story
and then watch it themselves and then
okay here's the fifth people if you're
the type of person that likes to take
cell phone recordings for your Instagram
or snapchat or just for video at a
concert know this every other person in
the world when they log into their
snapchat or Instagram and they're
watching a story and that story is a
dark room with crackling music they skip
it man nobody watches it nobody you're
ruining the experience for everybody for
nothing
including you you spying nasty off to
almost certainly there was there was
there was one time I went to a blink 182
concert
I mean I'm I was a ridiculous fan
obliquity to for a really long time
nice not their new stuff take off your
pants and jacket yank your life yes for
sure an enema of the state and like was
the album before that they had one
before that they had two before that see
you like I'm standing there first one no
that was the first one where they were
like a big deal oh yeah they also had a
different drummer well that makes sense
because he really catapulted them yeah
Travis is kind of incredible let's go
the discography ranch oh yeah I need it
more
I knew of dad dude yeah those were great
like oh yeah there's the album cover
with the big boxes but yeah rump yeah I
like the old punk stuff whatever
finally I ought to go see them in
concert was so freaking stoked Travis
gets like pulled up into the air his
drum platform gets elevated on these
like like a big cords and then they make
it vertex trapped in a thing he's free
was the one of the coolest things I've
like ever seen and I did like pull my
phone out but I recorded like lo the
worst video that's ever existed just
goes like I know it's gonna suck but I
want to just like be able to remember it
mm-hmm and that's yeah so I don't think
I sent it to questions you just say as
you watch that video again
I did actually again and I deleted it
immediately because it was completely
useless
you think recording it hampered your
experience no okay cuz again I didn't I
didn't put him from my face mm-hmm I
didn't put it in front of anyone's face
man I went to the like pulled it out
between a song okay
and like it was it was yeah I didn't
there's a way to do it and I think
everyone gets one the first ones free I
went of this folkloric ballet and Mexico
City once and this someone phone
recorded that no I wish they had iPad oh
I wish okay if I was a dictator if you
live in one of those dictator countries
one upside is you can make sweet or
whatever silly lul you want and if I was
a dictator my silly law would be if you
see someone taking a photograph or a
video with an iPad in public you are
completely allowed and culturally
sanctioned to walk by and bit swap that
thing down to the ground and they can't
get mad the gangster they can look you
caught me slipping I hate it bench
okay this lady recorded the anti I mean
entire I mean in my her like an hour
video someone stop her
cuz wouldn't that even her to like not
even I would have I was seething but
there was a language barrier my Spanish
isn't that good okay I didn't even mean
you I meant like someone who was running
I don't know we were at the kind of the
top okay
there was no haha I talked her out for
the show though I embarrassed my wife I
went up to the lady she it turns out she
spoke English
she wasn't Mexican actually and I I said
I just wanted you know that you ruined
the entire show for me you ruined it and
she was like what
I was on crutches and stuff so when I
first I got stabbed a few days before
and I I crushed up to her and so she was
and I was excuse me and so she was just
like okay where did you get stabbed in
an uber in Mexico City oh yeah by the
driver no he drove me a hospital Oh like
we were we were stuck in traffic was
broad daylight near a tourist area sorry
just you can't just like drop that yeah
it was a minor stabbing we are stuck in
traffic right when you're in gridlock
you can't move and the mistake we made
was that our windows were down so they
see a bunch of tourists the windows are
down I'm sitting in the back and
suddenly this there's a guy talking the
driver at his window so being in South
America I assume okay this guy's telling
us something and then I see that they're
like arguing and like he's got a knife
and I'm like oh the drivers getting
robbed and then I'm like oh we're
getting robbed and by that time his
partner there was two of them had to
come to the other side and but everyone
had their windows down to a different
degree mine was like all the way down my
buddy and I was behind the driver my
buddy in the passenger seat his window
was like this much down and my wife's
window was completely up and she was
behind the driver excuse me that was
something to do with the power was it
not okay anyway so my my friend at the
front seat one of the assailants put his
hand in that window gap and was like
groping at his pockets to try to get his
phone and meanwhile the guy on the
driver's side came to the seizure
stopped at a light we're stopping
gridlock traffic Laura and the other guy
came to the back and was like yelling at
me and my thought was like why don't we
just get out of the car and run away
like they're not gonna chase us there's
like a crowd of people everywhere like
that's just exit the vehicle while they
were like trying like yelling at us so I
moved over toward my wife but couldn't
open the door because it's like locks
because the car is moving
and basically I didn't I was probably
this far from him from the window like
I'm in the middle seat and I couldn't
understand what he was saying but I now
know it was like give me the stuff we're
going to stab you what he did was he
reached he didn't want to hurt me and by
the way this guy was like 19 tops he
reached in and like start stabbing at my
legs and he got me just above the knee
and it went in like a half inch like
nothing and it didn't hurt it it kind of
feels like it sounds that make sense
kind of just like okay and I was just
like god damn it so then I grabbed a
backpack that we had and I threw the
backpack at him and that backpack did
contain a DSLR camera the one only piece
of cashmere I owned and don't own since
like a sweater it's like a two pairs of
sunglasses we got like a decent haul and
by the way insurance never end up
claiming it because it was one of those
situations where your insurance would go
up and it wasn't worth it so he got that
but he didn't get our passports oh I had
just engaged I just become engaged I
proposed my wife like the week before
and the photos like I took a photo of
her right after I proposed to her and
she was like teary eye and had the ring
so those kind of sacred photos were gone
which was probably the biggest drag but
we still had our passports and I just
got my wife to give me her sweater and
like tied her on the leg and then we
took it took us like 45 minutes to get
to the hospital oh it was so chaotic man
it was like traffic we had a police
escort but they were still inept we went
to this first hospital and decided that
wasn't a good one like we were outside
the hospital like are they gonna come
and like bring something and then like
20 minutes later like we're just gonna
go to another one like okay we got to
drive down the wrong side of the road
with like police sirens blaring and
stuff and the scoober drivers just like
yeah it was insane yeah it was pretty
cool
my cousin speakers I've never been
stabbed but my cousin when he was in
high school there was another kid at the
high school I guess who his gang
initiation was to stab someone God he
just like walked with my cousin after
school and stabbed him my cousin pulled
the knife out and stab in back hell yeah
which is like
not really smart what is like wounds and
stuff I'm a badass but it was uh yeah my
cousins are insane he's got that fight
response oh sweet killer instinct good
Ram I got the afraid respond the flight
response oh god damn it just take the
badge
well I couldn't have ran if I wanted it
felt like you had the like disappointed
and disappointed response I guess like
why is this what's happening
hate for stupid thing I appreciate that
he stabbed my legs instead of like your
chest
it was so yeah he could just be like I
don't value human life like there's your
neck or like he I mean he could have
slept and got my femoral artery
but the damage that was incurred was
worth it for the story right like right
now I have a scar yeah cool I'd show you
but how did you take my pants off and
the camera won't even see it so yeah
it's not worth it yeah it's gonna be
like get off the platform it's just it's
too much stuff okay so the show is
almost over
oh yes sponsors we should probably do
sponsors yeah let's start with savage
jerk a Sauvage jerky which I'm sure
they're gonna be okay with me saying it
that way because they're amazing people
with amazing stuff it's it's it's beef
jerky it tastes amazing it's it's like
see I don't know how to describe it very
well it's very good beef jerky there's a
whole bunch of there's 13 different
flavors my favorite one is this one it's
just the standard Moho you can also get
crazy stuff like Reaper which is like
Carolina Reaper infuse beef jerky
there's bacon versions so there's like
sriracha bacon if you're one of those
many many people that are obsessed with
sriracha or bacon or banner which is
like that's a pretty big crossover I
think I've been diagram there with like
mostly overall yeah it's it's they say
it's jerky made with the best
ingredients and it doesn't have nitrates
or preservatives
and their goal was to create a snack
that was full of flavor and spice that
wasn't bad for you it's good if you go
to the website and use code LTTE
Thersites right here these code LTTE you
save 10% off of all of their products
trying to see how many I can hold at
once as you can as you can see they had
a lot of product they have yeah a lot of
them there some that are great for your
mouth some that are bad for your butt
just the Reaper one that one did you
have that one yeah yeah on the land show
absolutely disarmed you here it was I
tried to play it cool like it wasn't
that spicy but it was spicy spicy enough
you'll remember yeah these are non
spectrum and if you don't want to like
look like lazy James over there and you
want to reduce blue light from monitors
to like help you fall asleep at night
and I alter-ego reading James really and
you can get spectrum glasses you go to
the website right here save 10% by using
code Linus they say and this is totally
a thing that's staring a monitor all day
can be hard on your eyes and also make
it tougher to fall asleep the fall
asleep thing is is important to me using
software solutions like f.lux or
Twilight won't give you the same type of
filtering that these kind of things can
which is pretty cool they're stylish no
no no you guys look pretty good
I'm very hit-or-miss with glasses I
don't think these look great on me but I
sounds look great on Colten yeah I have
had spectrum glasses that have looked
good on me too and I think those look
good on you I was wearing these for a
while before I got like prescription
glasses were those the specific ones
these are the ones I was wearing at my
desk for a while and sometimes I wore
them just to look cool yeah they're
pretty sweet isn't working but I think
so
they have low color Distortion yeah
that's totally think there's there's a
few of these that will like really
hardcore make it look like everything's
yellow yeah these don't and there's
technically yeah there is technically
some but it's not very noticeable like
white stuff still looks white there are
there are some competitive glasses that
I've worn that do make things like yeah
these are
superlight which I like you can just you
know yeah whatever you want they are
primarily focused around Canadian US
markets in terms of like shipping and
all that kind of stuff but they are
expanding it to Europe and they do offer
international shipping they're just
going to Europe now yeah I didn't know
that yeah you know I went to school with
the founder oh he's a nice guy
his name's also James oh it's a nice guy
by his glasses cool I didn't know that
and if you're thinking about expanding
into Europe may be thinking about fresh
books
that might simplify your accounting and
free up enough of your finances to help
you do that little push you need I don't
know what market you might be in that
that would be applicable to but it might
make sense
hell of a segue yeah it was fantastic if
you do I know one thing that's really
applicable to our audience is people who
might be doing like little tech things
on the side like I know a lot like Linus
and I and most people that I know that
are really into computers at one point
in time really early on in their life
they were like the person that all their
friends knew that fixed and built and
repaired and maintained all the
computers around and you can turn that
into a business I did it for a few
little shops there for a while and
whatnot
I even had like an official company name
and all that kind of stuff and if you
really don't want to like manage
invoices manage expenses make sure
people are paying you if you have like
if you're not doing like cash deal under
the table every single time if you wanna
be a little bit more legit you want to
allow people to take time to pay for
stuff you can do that with fresh books
which is great you can create invoices
super fast you can check if people have
seen them you can manage all your
expenses which for me is a big deal
because I hate doing little micro
paperwork things it's one of my biggest
pet peeves oh yeah it just feels like a
waste of time all the time and then I'll
put it off for way too long
so yeah it's helpful fresh books super
cool check masks right here and yeah put
when and the how did you hear about a
section and use offer code win and go to
fresh books calm sasha win and
everything everything we're working on
getting the /na
implemented but it's not there yet so
for now it's lifetime yeah you know yeah
okay Lance isn't content Oh make it yeah
he's not coming let's do it so we'll put
him in the thumbnail though still you
know get more views that way I wanted to
do when we both did
we both did this like weird arm thing at
one point in time and I was gonna use
that all and we're talking with boss
dynamics maybe that was it I don't
remember I just remember being like I
have to mentally log that I was like
somewhere around three quarters to show
where is it kendo shares new details
about its Nintendo switch online service
which is going to launch this September
so cool it's kind of good it's kind of
bad the reason why I'm gonna say it's
kind of bad is because as you may or may
not know the online right now is that no
cost
and this will make it so the online is
at a cost and what might that cost be we
haven't written down here we do a year
for 25 bucks $24.99 so just just about
two bucks a month for an individual
okay that's Canadian pricing yes u.s.
pricing is 20 bucks so you at u.s.
pricing for one year is 20 bucks u.s.
pricing for three months is 8 bucks and
us pricing for one month is 4 bucks but
Canadian it is 25 10 and 5 respectively
there's also family membership pricing
so that covers 8 people and they can
even be on different Nintendo systems
and that in Canadian is 45 bucks a year
and 35 in American so if there's a way
to use that with just you and seven
friends that you're not actually related
to you might be able to that would be
sweet to be really cheap people do that
all the time with Spotify in and Shahnaz
right yes oh my kind of stuff I am
totally not on Linus's family plan for
something similar to that what can it do
well it gives you a few things it
includes some nest games like ice
climber Legend of Zelda balloon fight
soccer tennis Mario I love when games
used to be able to be just called soccer
or tennis yeah Mario Bros Super Mario
Bros dr. Mario Super Mario Bros 3 and
Donkey Kong and 10 more will also launch
with the service will be allows
announced at a later date so that is
completely novel that's totally new for
those games there's never before been
online play with those games is that
correct that's what I understood any of
that well okay so with emulators you
could wear yeah well you could Co Angele
than anything yeah but so any that
originally supported multiplayer will
still support multiplayer and will
support online multiplayer which is cool
because it'll be like a really easy way
to do so doing online co-op with
emulators has always been a little jank
but doable I don't think it's very known
if you cancel your subscription if
you'll still have access to those games
but I doubt it
back to the multiplayer thing
that's definitely new it's what I've got
written here is depending on the game
players can engage in online competitive
co-op or multiplayer or this is probably
new for all of them take turns
controlling the action yes so this was
this was something that I I noticed as
well which is really cool where I think
they call it like past the controller
yeah it says friends can even watch each
other play single-player games and past
the controller at any time so you can
watch your friend play a game through
the switch that's that's a cool idea
because I think with twitch we've we've
like sort of lost something which is
like I was playing a game with a friend
the other day and we both stream on
Twitch but we didn't want to stream at
that point in time
and I commented where like I I wish I
could see your screen right now because
like I was I was dead in a match and
there's no spectate yeah yes I was like
I wish you were like streaming but I
guess just to me what if and that's like
not super a thing do you think when once
you pass the controller you still have
control of where the controller goes or
do you think if I pass this throw I pass
it to you yeah I want to be able to yank
it cuz imagine how fun that would be if
you're watching ninja or you're watching
your favorite streamer and they're like
hey I'm going to the bathroom and then
they just pass their controller to some
random person in the stream and but it's
just like 2 million people get to watch
them play switch games yeah yeah
that would be pretty sweet that'd be
really sick actually I don't think it'll
work in that way but if I remember
quickly mixer does that Microsoft
streaming service so you can do stuff
like that but I could be super extremely
off base there
I know there's some form of thing that
can work that way but it might have been
a specific game that someone happened to
be playing on mixer it could be
completely unrelated I don't know but I
think that idea is super cool I like the
idea of sharing the controller too so
like if you're like dude look I'm so
stuck on this freaking boss oh yeah then
you like play the boss for a while and
he's like yeah give me a shot you just
like pass the controller over and you
said what about a new form of smurfing
you're like yeah 1v1 me and then there's
like someone spectating you're like send
it across there it is there's the thumb
you're alive that's the end of the show
we're gonna stop now
behind the night oh it's technically not
if you don't want it to be we went live
a little late oh okay can I come in into
a topic yeah sure all right I'll go
homes you can't take these though thank
you for keeping my seat warm
hi oh that is a warm seat you could say
it's a warm ass seat oh my
cuz it's an a/c so do I get one of these
shirts yeah you can have one if you want
it nice how much the creaks I designed
it myself it's good cute I like thank
you I like the show - I wanted to say
when I first saw this in person Riley
even asked me about it he's like so what
do you think of this said I was like but
it looks really good on camera
cool good did Wylie jump on the show at
all no wait oh oh I kind of thought he
was gonna into to come in and sort of
talk about working here and stuff he may
have been he can take me out okay oh
okay James is his bride well then okay
bye James and Riley but uh do we have do
we have any cool topics to talk about uh
we tried to leave some for you and then
you didn't show I was I was busy
I was busy running a laptop at five
gigahertz oh okay is it ridiculous or is
it reasonable oh-ho
it's not reasonable okay witness do you
want any spoilers is it the two big it
is it involves server fans oh no I'm
okay you got to do a follow-up video
where you going to use it in public it's
all me how people react it involves an
external variable voltage power supply
that's about this big
totally Youssou perfect it's louder than
a hairdryer totally I would love to I
would watch that video oh man you got to
name it I'm and like bring the it back
by like using the blah in public it's
terrible um we haven't talked about have
we talked about renting out your
graphics card for dining we left that
let's do that okay so the original
article here is from TechRadar and it
was posted by apparently no one on the
forum
apparently on it Morgan MLG man a German
company has announced games from space
which borrows your GPU for
cryptocurrency mining purposes and then
gives you free PC games in return so you
pick any game you want watch a progress
bar slowly tick up as your GPU is used
for the companies mining efforts the
faster your graphics card the quicker
the process towards getting a new game
so here's a really important thing to
point out games that you pay for on your
electricity bill are not free yeah which
I think a lot of kids are gonna think
they are this is totally going to be
kids using their computers to screw over
their parents yeah or people in dorms or
whatever else so it's I will give games
from space credit for being devious
enough to figure out one of the biggest
challenges of cryptocurrency mining and
that is power and actually cooling as
well so by distributing the computing
around the globe it's effectively kind
of not their problem and everyone who's
running on their network of computers is
going to be contributing such a small
amount to it that it's it's not really
going to be like it's not gonna be
noticeable some of the games are
actually newer big-name Affairs like pub
G or Grand Theft Auto 5 so with a gtx
1070 either of those would take you
about a month of mining you can get
directly in a day apparently now
obviously you won't be able to mine
while you are actually playing games and
from my experience with software like
nice hash it might not necessarily
cooperate that well when you launch
applications that want the GPU back like
i've that was actually why I stopped
running folding on my gaming system
because I was running into weird issues
even if folding at home was technically
getting the GPU back yeah yeah I was
still not not running correctly so I
would I would watch out for the same
problems that are
I would watch out for pretty much
everything about this what else we got
yeah so there's there was a few topics
where we did that Qualcomm is finally
making a SmartWatch chip so this was
originally posted by Edward the we've on
the forum hey James didn't tell you
you're not getting a ride and that you
can't come and say hi okay well let's
just burn through this really quickly
and then you guys can ask Riley some
questions and twitch at that sound
pretty good yeah
okay so frotcom is making a Smart Watch
chip hey best watches that come out
today have a little option but to use
Paul comm Snapdragon where 100 from
February 2016 some have argued this is
holding the entire where OS platform
back
it is pretty slow Qualcomm has announced
a watch focused silicon this fall
alongside a flagship device with several
partners set to release where OS watches
based on the new chips by the holidays
the third generation processors will be
designed from the ground up for a no
compromises SmartWatch experience so a
better battery life smaller watches
apparently designing the chips to work
more effectively with always-on displays
and a SmartWatch is first and foremost a
watch it needs to look good it needs to
be sleek it needs to look good when I'm
looking at it these are all just looking
good this is a quote nothing to do why
would you say that yeah has nothing to
do the chip alright thank you very MUC
slow SmartWatch probably related to that
last one okay I'm sorry
are you okay nine inch nails to fight
ticket BOTS by not selling tickets
online yeah we already covered that Wow
all right I covered that one because
James thought you wouldn't want to talk
about it so this guy works here now I
didn't want to I didn't want to make you
stop doing the actual news part well no
that's okay we have a new news show
that's true
no but a lot of people are concerned
they're like don't stop doing the wine
show it's not gonna stop so we're just
Sur completely of Central Park but he
misspelled the misspelling why he did
central prac it's a meme for the people
you can your own that's fine
central repair it's Riley yes this is
I'm having a hard time with his mic in
the middle yeah you know what why don't
you no no I'll take a back seat I'm just
a boy the last time I was on this show I
was a guest so what says are you only
hosting shows are you doing other things
at LG as well I'm writing what's the set
there on the camera over there you
gestured over here yeah I guess well I
didn't build the set I mean I sort of
did a bunch of people built it I've been
working on this that's like mud I've
been credit man can I say that yeah I've
been here for like a month and I've just
been building the set and doing a bunch
of stuff with a Vaughn and and adds all
yeah it was it was hard work guys but
I'm here Everett asked were you okay
when NCIX went bankrupt was i okay yeah
actually where are you going all right
yeah I was gone by the time they had
gone bankrupt I had left and started
with secret informants sorry no well
it's fine now okay you can talk about
Seger for me yeah so I went to do that
and then I was doing that for a while
and then we started talking yes we did
so what's that was born he's asking
someone's asking a blind Hewett is
asking you specifically if I'm a sister
who was right well you know I've only
been here for me I can't tell yet
if I no matter how I answer that
question I feel like it's gonna seem
insincere lice is a great boss no lice
is a terrible boss do you know they both
sound like lies
is the show still a work in progress
kinda seems coupled together it's it's
it's definitely a work in progress still
we're still like tweaking stuff you said
that on social media the other day so
like if you guys have suggestions for
how to change it definitely let us know
we will read them in we will take them
into account yeah it has its own Twitter
handle what is it add tech linked YT or
I think it's that too I think it's that
time I just like tech late maggio Sarah
says please salty sure with that exact
design yeah we're doing I think that's
the plan it's actually right now yeah
yeah yes up really fast yeah you got to
go to the LTTE merch store because tech
linked is still too bitch mode to have
its own merch store so it's no longer
like Linus and I make a meme on when and
then four months later we have a shirt
yeah fast
now memes to turn into t-shirts
immediately yeah yeah we actually have a
dedicated graphic designer so there's
there's been honestly there's been so
many moving parts getting this show
started getting him in here getting all
the design work done getting the set
built all the negotiations I really wish
I could tell you know most of the story
behind the the NCIX
tech tips acquisition effort right yes
okay that is now under NDA just so you
know but it's too long of a story to
tell anyways 10 out of 10 how out of 10
how crazy is it I mean it's insane I had
no when we were when we filmed the when
we filmed the announcement video when we
filmed the announcement video I wrote
the skit and then I wrote the out the
the end part and I'm like okay line is
fill in the NCIX story and I thought it
was gonna be like a couple paragraphs or
something it's like an essay pages long
or something I was like what you can't
do that and then he's like no we're
doing the whole thing stinky Pete said
great to see you are you continuing the
ncx persona ie quick bits or are you
trying to differentiate the show from
the past
I mean Central Park survived so why
don't know what else to call it
call quick bids if not quick bids rapid
small portion yes rapid-fire small
portion new steroids bits no I don't
know if you guys I mean we there are
some other names already but it's
supposed to be a spiritual successor yes
so like we adds I saw some people
leaving comments like wow you guys
really captured the essence of NIT
linked and I'm kind of sitting there
going well
oh crap we've got the same host and
writing staff we've got the same other
host and sort of troll and you know only
captured the hazards how did you do that
how'd you make sure it was so true to
the original the original basically the
original what does Central Park mean I
just feel like it's just kind of a long
story so it's kind of a lengthy it's an
inside joke originated on Flight of the
Conchords with me and my friend said all
the time and then I started saying it on
net like daily and yeah actually it
won't I know I did well I was just like
can I do it can i I guess I did
apparently quick bits during through so
it said you will do you said you will do
oh not only tech but until now it's only
been tech what's going on I will not do
only tech wear because it's at stem news
I remember that from the video oh yeah
so that's more of a bet hedging yeah
strategy you know like if if there if
some kind of like biomedical thing comes
out we don't want to end up in a stupid
argument with people in the comments
that that's not tech because when you
come when it comes down to it everything
is tech the wheel is tech it's yes I'm a
contrarian so that was actually a change
that I made to the script where I kind
of went look let's not paint ourselves
into a box you know it's about stem that
way it can be about basically everything
if someone finds a new prime number we
can talk about it games doesn't really
fit in there though
Oh what if we say it stems stemming
gaming stigma this new stems from what
do you hope to learn or improve working
with Linus speaking of I've already
learned to kind of like fly by the seat
of my pants as in like do it now do
something get it done you know
yeah you came in on your first day
didn't have an email address didn't have
like any passwords for anything didn't
actually have an assignment cuz yeah
basically we had put we put the whole
thing off for so long like we were split
Reilly's start date was supposed to be
like many weeks ago I think I think I
was looking at the emails and they
started like February or March yeah yeah
and so what happened was we kept
thinking we were gonna get the channel
and then we were like okay here's your
start date and then we were like oh we
weren't gonna get it but we were just
gonna start our own channel like and you
were like just stay tuned I've got I'll
get you an update and I'm just like okay
cool you're like okay yeah now this
happened the amount of people that got
chat banned immediately after you made
that joke was insane there's like a
whole block it's above this but just
like oh yeah anyway so so there was a
whole thing where we were just like okay
screw it we've got some pre-show
preparation to do like a set and you
know figuring out branding and all this
stuff Riley can help with that let's
just get him in here and and honestly
was it is a good move was actually next
idea because it really put the pressure
on me to start making videos with this
person that I'm paying
we hired a writer and host to build a
set maybe not I did learn a lot of my
management strategies from NCIX
so okay I'm hearing it was like coming
home
people are asking will you do man show
too well well I do n show too I mean I
guess that's up to you guys I don't know
we actually haven't really decided um
how we're gonna best utilize why they
think I'm screwing it up right now so if
you're taking that as an example yeah I
mean we we brought him in as someone
who's multi-talented like somewhat
something that some people wouldn't know
is he was basically running the entire
NCIX channel by himself by the end of it
and like arguably it wasn't its finest
you know moment but rude literally by
himself writing filming editing hosting
action actually posting it to YouTube
answering comments about yo guys what's
going on with my order what is that
whole place imploding what's going on
in the comments like so so we brought
Miley in knowing that we wanted to bring
back a spiritual successor to net linked
knowing that the best way to do that
would be to like bring back the the sort
of tag team that I think nothing against
anyone else who ever worked on that
linked but the tag team that I think
refined the net linked format made it
what it was and was kind of the Golden
Age of net linked in terms of audience
reception in terms of viewership yeah
well originally cuz net linked was net
linked weekly that you know on the NZXT
channel it was like a longer show and it
wasn't really I guess you guys edited it
a bit but like no that was before I came
Lodge yeah and then when we came on we
wanted or like a we're gonna make it a
daily show and then like and then you
guys took it totally cereal and then I
came in when I was like a contract yeah
I don't really care anymore that was
that whole casual feel of net linked was
not manufactured it was because I
actually didn't give any cares I would
roll in on a Friday that's definitely
the feeling I guess like 30 we
bang out all the videos that had to be
done for that week like for one and then
I'd be like yeah it's 2 o'clock boom see
ya you're out of there um and I'd come
back here in host when show often late
yeah yeah and then where we were kind of
like hey - so we wrote this funny bit
could you put the hat on and like do the
voice for the thing and he's like no I'm
doing this boom that's not that's okay I
get stuff wrong right like I'd read the
script wrong but I would just like keep
going through it because I was in a
hurry yeah
and that was where that kind of stuff
and people liked it mm-hmm so yelling at
people from off-screen and stuff yeah
that was all that was actually the only
feedback that I gave them on their
writing hmm was during the show
that was a stupid bit don't do it okay
what's an excellent so so so the goal
was to that seemed like the best way to
I don't forget where I was going with
this but it seemed like the best way to
to make this happen
was to bring back sort of what I see is
sort of the heart and soul of it and
then just inject it into something new
and I forget what the point of getting
there was no take a few different
questions and lump them into one yeah
how do you guys expect the channel to
perform some people are asking
comparatively to tech wiki they don't
really think that's super relevant but
like the like how do you expect the
growth of the channel to go I feel like
I'm a bad person to answer that question
you guys know so much about okay I think
this is general too so my expectation
for the channel was there are not my
expectation
my goal was as sort of a salty well sort
of thing
my goal was for tech linked to basically
immediately have as good or better
viewership than the latter episodes of
tech linked among the NCI XCOM channel
anything beyond that
I consider to be a smashing success and
as for the sales team anything above a
hundred thousand views a video should be
quite easy for them to bring in sponsors
for if they can bring
sponsors on a consistent basis we will
we will comfortably cover Riley's right
Lee's cost and the extra editing forces
that we need and Abimelech we don't do
free lunch here but good try so as long
as we can bring sponsors and we will
comfortably cover our overhead is
basically where I was going with that
even even like the square footage the
equipment like all those things that you
have to factor into the cost of the show
and I mean if your standard was that
they outperform like the later episodes
of now linked it's already done that so
yeah I think there's a bit of a
honeymoon period going on right now
though well but it could continue
forever perfectly continue forever
perfectly I mean honestly I think we're
gonna get there I think I think that not
I think we've actually gotten a lot of
feedback already from community members
saying there really was a gap there net
linked had a purpose this this SourceFed
style tech leaders thing was gonna
surprise when we stopped and people are
like there's no other like really quick
like tech news shows about like you know
cetera got like PC stuff and there isn't
a lot of people are trying to hit the
10-minute minimum middle and stuff yeah
but we're not interested in that we've
never cared about the 10-minute minimum
a lot of people we've released videos
that are ten minutes and one second or
whatever a lot of people are like aha in
the comments gotcha
and I'm kind of sitting there going or
you you don't understand how this works
the ten minute mark is only important if
you run a mid-roll ad sense spot and we
and we don't it doesn't matter oh you're
right is leaving I believe you can go
thank you for joining us thanks for
having me yeah this is cool
it's been fun I remember where I was
going with that
he's very multi-talented so we brought
him in knowing that he was
multi-talented thinking that we would
just find we'd find like a natural on
camera
everything that you need to do on like a
set thank you thank you so right now his
time is not completely occupied just by
writing tech linked and hosting it and
in some cases he won't even be hosting
it it's only a three times a week show
and I'll probably be hosting somewhere
between a third and a half of them Riley
will be doing between a third and half
of them and we might have other people
jump in James has expressed interest
colton has expressed interest and we'd
like to have it actually be quite quite
diverse maybe even Luke would come back
and host especially it on certain topics
so so yeah so so so I have two things in
the chat that I'm gonna pull from
archival stuff one someone was like oh
my god Luke is back that's confusing
I've been here the whole time
pretty much the other one was is Riley
Luke's replacement that's been asked a
whole bunch of times um so right now in
terms of actual hosting on LTTE I am on
the fence you will see Luke hosts
another LTT before you will see Riley in
fact how's that going good it keeps
changing right I can probably just talk
about it yeah sure yeah
so I'm doing Nintendo lab oh but I've
changed how I wanted to review it a
couple times I don't think I haven't
seen a single review but online that I
think this is gonna throw some shade has
done a very good job because I agree and
because of that I'm now like okay that's
a lot of pressure because I'm thinking
no one's get done a very good job of
covering it so now I need to not screw
up you've been in that position before
and I think I'm trying to think of an
example we were really late on was it
the rift we were really late on
something that you like cared about a
lot might have been vine I think it was
one of those it was what it was it was
our headset I think yeah and basically I
think we talked about it and we were
like okay well then in that case yeah I
think I'm okay I'm remembering this even
better now I remember talking about it
and you were like this is gonna take a
long time and so I took on so we're sort
of some more quick yeah quick
videos to fill in the gaps cuz I think
you spent like almost an entire week on
it yeah so it's been a little bit hard
because this week we've been we've been
pushing for v1 which won't mean anything
to you guys
also I'm hiring problems while I was
yeah also I'm hiring for full plant so
I've been going through resumes and
stuff also been trying to do this lab Oh
thing and I was like I'll be done early
in the week and then I was like done
most my notes and I was like it's been
out for a while let me watch some
reviews and see what's going on and I
was like oh okay alright
this changes things because when like
when everyone else's stuff is like again
I'm pretty certain it's really surface
level and really missing the point in my
opinion for most people it's it's yeah I
have to take it to the next level I
think so yeah I should be ready
relatively soon I'm expecting next week
so I'm traveling for like the next two
and a half weeks or something like that
Oh have we told people that scrap care
dwarfs season sevens coming no I don't
think so
we are shooting we actually have a shoot
date yeah we have a sponsor locked in
finally we've got a shoot date it's
going to should we should we tell them
the the the challenge I mean I don't
know it let's do top my head I've been
actually been emailed it I just don't
remember sure okay yeah yeah so it's
gonna be a classic head-to-head me
versus Luke no teams no gimmicks except
for one gimmick neither of us gets an
internet capable device oh I remember
that oh I remember that
oh that's so sketch okay okay okay
previous seasons we've been heavily
reliant on Craigslist hardcore or like
buy and sell trade apps is it still
possible to build a decent gaming rig
what other rules are we including I
don't know we're gonna have to kind of
we'll have to hash that out between
because I'm assuming like the one the
like ace in the hole is not allowed
I don't remember name yeah you can't go
too freaky yeah yeah no no no or like
and we're also getting rid of free geek
for similar situations um I think if
I both do no research which is what I've
done and we don't look them up online I
don't know any I don't know any either
so we I think they're fair game at that
point go to the library and get a phone
book I wouldn't give me any ideas if I
were you
alright so we're gonna keep to ourselves
what our ideas might be for dots this is
gonna be really hard
okay yeah that's gonna be interesting
luckily the the one thing I was actually
really worried about for this coming
scrap red horse was GPU prices it looks
like that's all results coming back down
yeah I think we dodged that bullet
because that was like actually gonna
make it impossible or stupid they were
gonna be the crappiest scrapyard water
species yet yeah we would have had or do
like the like student computer CPU
benchmarks only Nina and 262 in the chat
sorry just blowing the dust off my local
computer store yeah exactly
man this is gonna be pretty dumb yeah
alright well I think that's pretty much
it for wine show thank you guys for
tuning in see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel bye oh we
should we should let people weigh in on
whether they want the win show to stay
here with the white orange and white or
if we want to move over to the hex wall
yeah we haven't painted the hex file yet
though I think right now there's like a
lighting problem or something oh yeah
it's it's Garbo it needs to it just
needs to be it needs a light on the
floor you've been like your face and
we're also gonna have some shelves here
yeah there's gonna be some stuff there
like yeah there's some there's some show
me straw for right now looks like people
are staring hex wall but they're also
getting banned oh no I know we can ask
them next week am I even here next week
hex wall will be really dark yeah that's
something to consider well we're gonna
be paint it red white and blue okay
not like America style red white and
blue like I forget how we're planning to
do it like white background and then
like red and blue hexes or something
good but like bright ones I think what
we should do is on the win show have a
screenshot of here and there and like
both of them on
screen yeah I'm gonna be like pick one
we could do that all right CEO okay bye
I just realized I'm sitting on the wrong
side yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
