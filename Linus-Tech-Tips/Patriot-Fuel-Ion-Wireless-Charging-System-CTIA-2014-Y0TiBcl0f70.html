brought to you by AT&amp;amp;T are you sick and
tired with dealing with the hassle of
plugging in cables all the time is Qi
charging simply not fast enough for your
on-the-go lifestyle well I say 'pete
refuel ion is the system for you okay
enough with the cheesy voice over this
thing is pretty cool the patriot ion
wireless charging system is comprised
mainly of their cases for the Samsung
Note 3 s4 and s5 phones along with
iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s with iPhone 6 and
Note 4 cases coming in the future
the Samsung compatible phones connect to
the phone via pogo pins in the back
while the Apple ones connect via a
lightning connector in the bottom you
will also need some form of magnetic
docking station these come in the form
of a charging plate which rests the
phone down flat a charging stand which
holds the phone in a slanted position
and a car mount for your windshield or
with a little mounting accessory or dash
as well the magnets in these devices are
actually quite strong resulting in the
phone snapping into place quite securely
while allowing you to rotate the phone
to whatever position best suits your use
case another accessory worth noting that
you can get is the wireless battery pack
which allows you to charge wirelessly on
the go this is actually pretty cool as
we all know how fragile micro USB
connections are I'd rather my wireless
charging pack was pulled off the back of
my device stopping it from charging
instead of having the USB connector
break off my phone stopping it from
charging forever this 2100 million power
battery bank is able to charge in daisy
chain with your device and while they
didn't have a spec for how fast the
charging was in daisy chain it should
still be pretty quick if their claims of
only a 0.5% lower charging rate than
wired
hold true especially when compared to
their claims that Qi charging is 60%
slower than wired charging
well guys I'm personally pretty
impressed with how well the magnet works
and I hoping get some time with it alone
in the office so I can test it against
direct connection and Qi charging myself
but as always thank you guys for
watching and if you want to see all of
