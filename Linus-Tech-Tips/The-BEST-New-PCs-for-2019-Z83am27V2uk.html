range of desktops and laptops that go
from freakin incredible to genuinely
disappointing and now it's time for our
roundup of the top five Intel powered
computers sponsored by Intel starting of
course with the Orion 9000 or more
specifically the Orion 9000 hooked up to
what acer is calling the throne oafs
this thing couldn't be more aptly named
it comes with the core i7 8700 k
processor and r-tx 20 ATT i like 64 gigs
of ram or something crazy like that it's
this giant tower but it's nothing
compared to the chair that actually
comes as part of the package so for your
$10,000 you get an awesome gaming system
a full set of gaming peripherals three
27-inch 144 Hertz gaming monitors and a
motorized gaming cockpit that not just
has an arm that swings open and closed
to bring your peripherals to you but it
also has drink holders a USB hub and
even a zero gravity mode where it tilts
the entire thing back so you can be
completely immersed in your games the
last thing that blew me away
is that a sir will come to your house
and set it up for you a process that
they say will take two hours or more
next up we've got the Corsair one pro so
two years ago when the Corsair one
originally came out we were amazed that
they were properly cooling and powering
a quad-core processor and a GTX 1080 in
such a small package
with water cooling - but since then
Corsair has turned up the dial upping
the course - six and we were like okay
that's nice but then 12:12 course in the
Corsair one pro and they claimed it
could handle even Intel's 18 core
processors if someone wanted to come in
and upgrade it themselves so this thing
cannot just gain but it can crank out
renders streams and generally hold its
own in any kind of workstation
and generally hold its own in any kind
of light workstation application like
video editing and when it is time to
game the one pro is equipped with an RT
x20 atti and they've got a 750 watt
power supply crammed in there that like
the rest of the fans in the system can
be turned off when it's idle so it is
darn near silent next up what if you
want to go even smaller than a corsair
one Wells otech has you covered with the
Mac Mini crammed into this nine point
one seven liter chassis they have
somehow got a core i7 8700 and an nvidia
r-tx 2070 meaning you can have real
gaming power at a landlord like
dreamhack or something without breaking
your back the rest of the loadout is
fairly sensible with 16 gigs of ram a
240 gig SSD and 2 terabytes of hard
drive space to store all your games and
currently it's destined to be available
in this black color in a month or two
and then they also have for other funky
colors that could be coming if there's
interest keeping with this video's theme
of increasing portability as we go asus
made this so the rog mothership it's
like a laptop but with the laptop bits
moved up behind the screen so moving the
components here has allowed them to make
it a lot thinner than the G 703 that it
sort of replaces due to the improved
thermals that they get when the computer
part isn't being choked out by sitting
right next to the desk the rog
mothership features a detachable
wireless keyboard meaning you can Center
its position in a more comfortable way
compared to the screen and if you're
worried about latency by the way you can
plug it in via USB type-c of course it
wouldn't be a desktop replacement if it
didn't have the horses of a desktop but
fear not rocking a core I nine 8950 hk6
poor overclocked little processor and
r-tx 20/80 and a three
MDOT two drives in raid zero through the
CPU itself rather than all through the
chipset for better bandwidth the
mothership can certainly run with the
big boys and we are very curious to see
what it's going to be like to switch to
longer term once it's passed the
prototype phase on the subject of
prototype phase we've got the asus strix
240 Hertz with almost every laptop under
the sun getting an upgrade to RTX 20
series GPUs and of course superfast core
i7 processors getting them to pump out
frames isn't a problem it's having a
display that can keep up but asus has
fixed that by increasing the refresh
rate of their new Strix car to 2 240
Hertz like the responsiveness of the
display on this thing is absolutely
incredible with that many frames being
delivered to your eyes you'll get true
competitive advantage in games like csgo
and Rainbow six siege and you know
what's even better it's not a TN panel
meaning you get that added
responsiveness and fluidity without
sacrificing things like color and
viewing angles now for those of you
keeping score you might have realised
that we already did 5 but 5 just wasn't
enough when Alienware came in with their
area 51 m and basically blew my mind
like sure it's pretty big as far as
laptops go and it doesn't change the
form factor like the mothership did but
somehow they got a full powered desktop
core I $9.99 hundred K in this thing
like look at this that is a desktop
socket like you could just you could you
could buy a lower end one and just rip
out the CPU and put in a different chip
if you wanted and the craziest thing is
they didn't stop the upgrade ability
there because the GPU an RTS 20/80 they
are saying can also be swapped out with
Dells not MXM mobile GPU form factor so
that means that assuming they continue
to support it which they've said they
want to this machine could be spitting
out top-end frame rates for years to
come and I guess that about does it for
our top Intel powered systems at CES
2019 thank you didn't L for sponsoring
this video thank you guys for watching
it and we will see you guys back at the
office</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
