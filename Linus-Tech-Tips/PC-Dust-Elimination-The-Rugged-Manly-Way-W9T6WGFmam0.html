somewhere amongst doing makeup and
dancing ballet amongst rugged man's
typical priorities even the ruggedness
man needs to take care of business when
his PC starts to overheat slow down it
all started with finding a static free
well ventilated location I chose to be
outside in nature only the cows were
there to witness what was about to
happen dust and other airborne junk like
cigarette smoke hinders cooling
performance and can even cause a PC to
die but even knowing about the
possibility of death didn't prepare me
for what I would see when I ended the
side panel screws and looked inside that
Tower
I gave it one blast then I gave it
another going for the biggest bunches in
the corners of the case first I held the
can upright firing in short bursts to
ensure my duster can perform optimally I
blasted until my fingers got cold
I know it's normal for these kids to get
cold after extended use and they perform
better warned so I took a break my enemy
weakened and my own resolve hardened
like steel I was ready to tackle the
most challenging parts I helped the fans
down to prevent them spinning and
damaging the headers they were attached
to and I let her rip I was merciless
compassionless
with the dust out of the fans and the
heatsinks around the CPU in the graphics
card I began to realize that evidence of
the slaughter was all over I needed to
get rid of it
dust can be harmful if inhaled and it's
just plain gross but the main reason was
I wanted to hide what I've done I
vacuumed it up I wish I could have
vacuumed it in the first place but that
can pause static build-up zap my stuff
can't have that but there was still
evidence of dust had been there I knew I
could use a small paintbrush with mic
and pick at the nooks and crannies and
get the remainder off safely and restore
all my PCBs to their former glory but
what kind of man's got time for this
paintbrush nonsense so I grabbed the air
compressor that I really wished I'd
remembered that I had from the start I
didn't run it at full strength because
the last thing I wanted was more blood
on my hands when the capacitors blew off
a motherboard but I kept my distance
went slow and was able to remove the
last of the dust but it was all over I
took my PC and went inside knowing that
I was a changed man but my CPU wasn't
throttling anymore
and my frame rates were back to normal
so was it worth it did the sacrifice
needed to be made yes yes it did thank
you for watching this very unusual video
on Linus tech tips don't forget to like
the video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it subscribe if you thought
it was awesome and you want to see more
well actually we might never do this
again so leave a comment if you want to
see this kind of thing again peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
