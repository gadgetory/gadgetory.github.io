the a soos zone our essence STX now I
talked about sound cards a lot and
people ask me for sound card
recommendations a lot and you know
there's sort of lower end ones the whole
zone our line actually is just kind of
awesome so whatever your price range is
just by his owner and you'll be fine um
but this one is like the baller zone R
this is the zone R with all the features
that you need especially if you use
headphones so 124 decibel sound to noise
ratio which is just ridiculous I mean
remember that decibels are essentially a
doubling of in terms of sound to noise
ratio it's a doubling of quality every
time you go up three decibels okay so
thank remember that so when you see
something that's a hundred and ten
decibels sound to noise ratio that is
like many times worse than this okay
it has swappable op amps which means you
can actually customize the sound of it
according to your liking so if you don't
know what op amps are those are the the
components on the board that actually do
the amplification for the card okay so
we're going to go ahead and start
opening this up the reason I'm opening
this is because we're using it in like
an ultimate system build guide so if I
was picking an ultimate sound card for
me personally this is the one that I
would choose let's have a look at what a
Suze has to say for themselves on the
Box here anyway though so
industry-leading okay with basically no
distortion built-in headphone amp
provides exceptional quality even with
600 ohms of impedance remember guys for
context a sennheiser HD 800 is 600 ohms
of impedance so we're talking like
spending well over a grand on headphones
before you're going to run into the
limits of what this can drive okay nikka
con fine gold capacitors offer great
dynamic performance it uses audio
capacitors which are actually different
from the kinds of capacitors that some
competing products are using on sound
products whether it's built into a
motherboard or whether it's built into a
sound card where they're more like
motherboard capacitors different faster
will affect the way the sound comes out
of the analog things like remember guys
okay any of the music you're listening
to is inherently digital any of the
sound you listen to is inherently analog
so the process of converting that
digital signal to an analog sound is
extremely complicated and depends on
every aspect of the design of the card
so everything from the processor to the
DAC so that's the digital to analog
converter everything to the do they have
anything on here about the emi shielding
okay well emi shielding to keep just
random interference that's bouncing
around inside your PC from it from
affecting any part of that process to
the to the op amps as well everything
affects the process so okay moving right
along perfectly shielded EMI freon okay
there it is customize your sound card
effortlessly with swappable app op-amp
sockets you can just buy them online
it's not a big deal okay in terms of
driver features Dolby Digital live
you'll be headphone will be virtual
speaker it'll be Pro logic to track
sound 3d vocal effects smart volume
acoustic echo low acoustic echo
cancellation that's kinda neat okay and
let's go ahead and check out the card
itself so they have like an awesome
picture of the heart which we'll use to
help us through the process oh yeah so
guys if you'd if you don't know I'm
running um a soos uh s run what am i
running I'm running a zone our sense
which is a similar card to this one but
actually not quite as good if I was
going to pick my ultimate sound card
this one would be it so in terms of i/o
you've got stereo outputs so front right
front left this is if you're using an
external amplifier so for for amplified
speakers or something like that then
you've got your amp headphone jack
you're lying in and your spit if this is
your digital out so this is a headphone
lovers
sound card this is not for you know 7.1
or you know whatever sort of things that
people think are fancy this is for
audiophiles who are interested in stereo
speakers high-quality output - stereo
speakers or high-quality output to
headphones
it does have front panel jacks so you
can still plug in your front panel head
phone jack and microphone jack but
honestly guys if you're not using these
ports you're doing it wrong with a sound
card like this has a dedicated molex
power adapter or connector rather and
that is because this card actually does
draw some power in order to deliver that
crunchy sound at a moment's notice it
also has some very large caps going on
just going to help with that as well you
can see that while this sort of shield
on here this EMI shield looks like it
has gaps in it there's only very small
gaps so from the inside of the case
there's almost no way for any kind of
interference to get made because he's
actually blocked
there's a copper piece that's right in
there that makes it so that nothing can
really sort of get in there it uses PCI
our rather PCI Express 1x connectivity
remember guys that can be plugged into
any PCI Express slot whether it's 1 X 4
X 8 s or 16 X PCIe one PCIe 2 PCIe 3 all
of those standards are are basically
interchangeable for the purposes of
something like a sound card here's an
adapter so you can take those analog
outputs and you can run them to just
sort of a regular stereo jack okay
here's an adapter for this so you can
run smaller Jack headphones or
microphone off of this alright and then
there is Oh awesome I actually didn't
realize this but this coax Jack right
here is actually optical as well so you
just use the included adapter and you
can get them you can do optical audio up
from there too
alright in fitted documentation audio
precision test report your individual
sound card was actually tested and this
was printed out from your sound card so
this will give you the full
characteristics of your card this card
that's in the box as opposed to being
some kind of generic you know how a lot
of high-end products come with like a
certificate of performance or something
like that that actually has no basis on
this thing this physical object that's
in the Box not how it works with an
essence STX this is a serious sound card
alright we got a thing about the
philosophy of something in a picture of
the card ok that I'm less interested in
moving right along we've got its uses
driver desk don't use this download the
latest off the EC's website they're
excellent also there's a third-party
universal driver for zone are cards that
actually has a couple of extra features
so that's kind of cool
here's a sticker that you could put on
something ok here's a Quick Start Guide
here's a bother so there's a lot of
documentation in here slick there's
another Quick Start Guide there's two
Quick Start Guide so these the same
thing oh no they have different part
numbers on them ok and then there's like
another poster they have two posters
included ok all right
who um I think that pretty much covers
it so if you're looking for a sound card
recommendation my general recommendation
is some kind of zone art card if you're
looking for a specific recommendation I
would take this one personally I'm more
of a headphone guy I don't use surround
so that's that's the context of that
recommendation from me but let's just
see if we're missing anything here hyper
grounding circuitry design okay oh I
don't know if I mentioned but it uses a
beurre Brown PCM 1792 a digital analog
converter so that's part of achieving
that 124 decibel single noise ratio this
one can do even better than that
swappable op amps perfectly sealed
analog output path with all that
shielding and all of that good stuff
and I think that pretty much covers it
