assuming that it'll be free only to
discover that it is Occupato look I'm
gonna cut you off right there because
you don't really do anything here
anymore so I really need you to sign
this well to avoid that kind of
awkwardness and to help prevent James
from being constantly pestered by people
who want to know who who's in the
meeting room when are they gonna be done
in the meeting room when do you think I
can use the meeting room
we've deployed a Joan board basically
this tells you everything you need to
know about this meeting room and they
are the proud sponsors of today's video
it's got a little cap of fees on this
cap a face down
so believe it or not the meeting room is
actually one of the least difficult
rooms to to get your hands on around
here and my office is a much much bigger
problem and while I do have this
low-tech solution to whether or not I am
in the middle of meeting or doing
something important
nobody ever really looks at it or that
is to say they do look at it but they
just assume that it's irrelevant when
they see do not disturb they just like
kind of point at it and and then they
just come in anyway so today Alex and I
will be deploying the deluxe err version
of the joan meeting board the bigger one
for my office oh wow this one is way
bigger
ow ah dang it
well it was only a matter of time before
I dropped it surely joan knew what they
were getting themselves into when they
sponsored this video what is this man
it's another small one oh we got another
small one I told my wife that if you
have the choice you should take the
small one no let's get those take the
big one all right okay fine you tell me
how to do it smart guy well you want to
do it like by your door so you take this
part of it oh that's another piece okay
so this goes like right on the window
then so this actually replaced there's
my other one out right okay yeah now
that seems like a suitable I never
noticed before that this isn't Center to
them it took until I was replacing it to
realize for how heavy this thing is I'm
surprised that it mounts on a magnet
what are the chances of it falling down
look it also has like vase on mounting
on it too just in case you are afraid of
the magnet okay create your Joan web
portal account at portal dot get Joan
calm all right
well don't we already have one yeah but
you might as well just make a new one
what
you didn't save it idea put all accounts
and last paths here we go all right now
what do we do set up follow the
instructions in the Joan portal to set
up Joan oh you don't have to cloud post
it no you can do an internal those
things how cool okay
did you jam that in the wrong way oh no
you know it's fine
there we go so the proof that anyone can
do this is gonna be if the two of us
managed to set this thing up 30 frames
per second wow they couldn't go higher
perhaps no that's up to 58 now oh nice
oh wait what is this no not that
what is that what is LMG plasini at
before
okay can we reshoot picture the ink is
so cool cuz it just looks like
completely dead like it just looks like
a tile okay I created a new Wi-Fi go
ahead and scan yeah there you go
great reception on that one what is the
password all caps
suck it Alex I don't take back
connecting to Alex sucks Wi-Fi you know
what I bet oh wait alright there we go
okay big X small X 8 6 small left Big C
4 suck it Alex all caps no no don't oh
yeah yeah that wasn't no word I did make
them type it again so so we need to go
into your calendar now
oh boy my calendar okay why don't we
just turn off everything that could have
embargoed information on it and or
information about like so this is all oh
I gotta know I gotta remove that okay
Wow okay so we could just sync it to an
existing calendar but we're gonna create
a new one for my office here
how about you learn to spell you're
literally a professional writer hi this
is sex done on hopefully like joan
meeting boards and watched one or two of
our videos before her sponsoring fits
all right okay Linus office okay cool
then what we just scroll down get
shareable link I think that's it okay
no one copy that great no one copy that
either yeah don't copy any of those this
entire calendar is gonna be full of
silver role events that would actually
be hilarious you know what everybody go
ahead and copy that I don't even care
I'm gonna leave this on my door you can
schedule any meetings for me that you
want do we have to like link the Joan
portal to my Google account because
right now it's yours or we could add you
yes and people ago you are now the
administrator of my personal calendar
yes officially you've been promoted
you're now my personal assistant
you and Joan you put the ass and
assistant like you're an ass not like
that kind No
we got that working okay now what look
at devices now we can make this device
manage that RIM device sweet own premium
there heck yeah
well it even keeps the the kappa faces
that's like company-wide i guess so
heck yeah okay so let's go put it up so
now we just have to rely on our
community not to be amateur - office so
today is the 17th and time to go home
and it starts at a time of 6 o'clock
p.m. now theoretically we could do that
and then we could have so tuesday
morning colton firing and we could add a
time for that this is actually pretty
cool I'm not gonna do it first thing in
the morning I don't like firing Colton
like right when I get into the office so
we can do that at 10 a.m. and then
serious business planning session well
we're gonna hire him back Executive
lunch time is the best lunch time I'm
gonna take a long lunch tomorrow two
hours all right let's see boom current
meeting gone and it shows the next
meeting yeah like look at the app it's
just like - office oh that's cool
so really the best way to use this would
not be to just have it right that's why
we're doing this yes just one room was
kind of stupid oh no they're all on here
now check this out so that's cool so
then we can have one for my office one
for that office we could have one for
the one over there and then when you
need a meeting room you don't actually
have to get up and go check right that's
the point
all right yeah the days over yeah it
actually knows that cool yes we should
also say that the battery lasts of the
year
I hear ya year lasts all year does it
you got a smaller ones a couple months
ha but I guess that's why an e-ink
device like this needs to be this thick
so there you have it everyone that's the
joan meeting board feel free to book
