this forever this is the Grippit take
control with grip it the competitive
edge so grip it is basically little
rubber doohickeys that go on top of the
analog sticks on your controller so this
is an Xbox 360 wireless controller but
you can see it is compatible with both
ps3 and with Xbox 360 it is eco-friendly
packaging so it's not the Frog isn't the
only thing on here that's green and this
is the softest material with the most
grip possible
so step bond okay okay why don't we show
the instructions when we're actually
putting this on because I'm gonna just
put this on my xbox 360 controller this
is going to be an unboxing and
installation guide so I assume the black
ones here are the 360 ones so I'm just
gonna kind of rip this and hope it comes
apart into some meaningful way all right
here we go here we go that's not so bad
not so difficult I can unbox this kind
of box anything alright so these are the
softest most grippy materials possible
okay so step one you take the Grippit
and you put it on top of the analog
stick I'm gonna just sit down so as to
better be able to install complicated
hardware's here okay so you flip it
inside out so this is this is the grip
itself it's got a little frog foot on
the top of it so you just take it and
flip it inside out okay and you take
that you position it over the analog
stick on your controller okay so that's
step one step two is to pop grip it back
over the original to the original
position so it wraps around the analog
stick okay so let's do that
mmm-hmm let's just kind of give it a bit
of a stretch here I'm sure that we've
got it fully ripped and wrapped there we
are okay so now it's on there well it's
definitely softer and more grippy and
there's like a bit of a cushion enos to
it now because the top of the Grippit is
flat whereas the top of the regular
analog stick is kind of concave so it's
you know kind of cushions now okay step
three is look really scary like her Wow
prepare to have the best analog control
performance for any video game okay so
hold on where'd my other one go oh no
dad is it I lost it I lost my other
Grippit I couldn't hold on to it ah
there it is how ironic to not be able to
hold on to a Griffin now the blue ones I
don't know if they're actually different
why don't we take the blue one out and
find out if they're different because if
you could buy one pack and use both blue
and black on like two Xbox 360
controllers then that adds some
personalization as well as some
additional grip eNOS okay so these
appear to be the same so I'm going to be
a rebel and I'm gonna take a blue one
and I'm gonna put that on my xbox
controller 200 I didn't get it on gonna
pull that down there there we go yeah oh
I wonder if the blue ones don't fit now
it should fit and should fit I just kind
of got that around there yeah there we
go
okay so that's my xbox 360 controller
blinged-out
with grip it thank you for checking out
my unboxing don't forget to subscribe
and oh please focus camera there
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
