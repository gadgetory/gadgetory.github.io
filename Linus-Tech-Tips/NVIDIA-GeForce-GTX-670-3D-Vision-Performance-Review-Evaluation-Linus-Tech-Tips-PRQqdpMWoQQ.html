complete without some 3d vision coverage
so what I'll be focusing on here is the
GTX 670 versus its predecessor
predecessor predecessor the 570 as well
as versus its Big Brother the GTX 680 so
I'll just be looking at in a couple of
games I'm not going to go too deep into
the games on this one so we're just
going to do Crysis 2 as well as Skyrim
in a couple games which one delivers the
best 3d experience I'll be using all the
same settings that I used for my regular
1080p performance review which means I'm
running all of these games pretty much
maxed out and so yeah you see the end of
my Crysis to run through there I clearly
died because I couldn't really do
anything without the glasses on but yeah
stay tuned I'll show you guys the
performance results as well as that was
pretty much it just performance results
for this stereoscopic 3d performance
evaluation I'll be using the same test
bench I'm using for my regular review
which is a gigabyte X 79 ud7 so that's
up to four-way SLI capable motherboard
I've got a 3930k overclocked to 4
gigahertz for my CPU that's a 6 core
processor with hyper-threading 16 gigs
of kingston 1600 megahertz ram and a
Cronos SSD Chronos deluxe SSD for my
boot drive and then obviously I'll have
a variety of different video cards and
the H 100 keeps the CPU nice and cool at
that overclock so for Skyrim I'm doing
my usual run-through so I didn't show
this in the 1080p performance review
some as well show it now so basically I
just take a walk around the town I go
over to the end of there I stare at that
fire for a little bit over there and
and I walk over here and they come up
here and around here and you know
looking off into the distance a fair bit
I stare at these two guards a little bit
just to make a point of looking at a
couple of character models and that is
how I evaluate Skyrim yes I know this is
a bit of an ideal scenario and there's
not too much in terms of particle
effects or tons of characters on the
screen but it does give me reproducible
results that I can easily compare from
one card to another so it gives us an
idea of how they perform relative to
each other
so as you guys will see in a moment when
I show you the graph that's on the
screen right over there the GTX 670 just
destroys the 570 it's the card that it's
replacing in 3d gaming performance so
Crysis 2 is a great game to test in 3d
because it's pretty much designed from
the ground up for it there's very little
performance hit for enabling 3d sorry
guys I'm a little slow it's late
there's very little performance hit for
enabling 3d it's a great title to play
in 3d other than you know a little bit
of weirdness around the gun it just
looks fantastic so you can see here the
GTX 670 is just barely slower than its
Big Brother the 680 this card is just
yeah it's uncharacteristically close to
the very very high-end card in spite of
the significant difference in price and
I'm sorry I forgot to fix these labels
but this is min fps and this is max FPS
if you guys weren't already aware so you
can see the min fps that's where you're
really gonna see the big difference
between the 670 and the 570 because this
is about a 50% improvement in minimum
frames per second which it translates to
a very tangible tangibly better
experience when you're playing in 3d The
Witcher 2 gives us some very telling
stats because you can see how kepler has
been significantly beefed up compared to
Fermi in terms of its stereo 3d
performance even in titles that aren't
you know sort of 3d from the get-go when
the when the game developer was
designing it so you see this the GTX 680
so even if the 670 was about 10% slower
at 31 minimum and you know 44 max our
average FPS that is still
a 3x plus almost a 4x improvement over
the GTX 570 in terms of the minimum
frame rate so I ran into the same
weirdness with which or to where the GTX
670 outperformed the 680 that I did when
I wasn't running in 3d in my hypothesis
at this time is that because I'm using a
newer driver revision that is not yet
compatible with the 680 so I had to use
two different drivers that there are
some which or two performance
improvements to be had and we're going
to see this number get boosted up in the
near future as well so thank you for
checking out my 3d performance overview
I know I only did a couple games but the
general idea was I just wanted to see
how does it compare against the previous
generation in terms of 3d performance
and the answer is very favorably and how
close can it be to its Big Brother and
the answer is very very very close which
was true when we weren't running in 3d
and is also true when we are running in
3d so thank you for checking out this 3d
performance review of the GTX 670 from
Nvidia and don't forget to subscribe to
