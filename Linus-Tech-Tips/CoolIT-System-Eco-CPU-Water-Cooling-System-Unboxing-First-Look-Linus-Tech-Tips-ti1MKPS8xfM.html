very exciting new product this is be
cool it eco it is a brand new liquid
cooling product from kulit systems so I
don't know if you remember this far back
but their very first liquid cooler was
the cool it free zone ok so the free
zone was revolutionary well not
revolutionary because it wasn't the
first cooler to ever use a temp or
pelletier but it was the first one to do
it with any commercial success with
liquid cooling so they went from there
they produced the Freezone elite as well
as the pure the pure turned into the
domino and the domino has given birth to
the eco so as we go and unbox this
product i'll tell you a little bit more
about the evolution of it but why don't
we start with what's on the outside of
the box so i'll use my handy dandy
remote have a zoom in here and i will
tell you what it says even though you
could probably read it just as easily
yourself so it supports AMD and 2 a.m. 2
plus a and 3 as well as 775 1156 and
1366 are pretty much every socket out
there right now and as long as it's not
a server socket it is extreme cooling
maintenance-free and simple to install
all right what do we have on the outside
here this looks like the same thing is
it differently with this or something
what are they doing oh no they've gone
and they put the same diagram on two
sides of the box to confuse me they
actually have different bullet points on
them so here we go Universal retention
system out of the box support provided
for all those sockets I listed below
proprietary pump with a ceramic bearing
including malad including but a 5000 our
lifetime okay so mean time to failure
alright then we have a high performance
radiator which is custom engineered for
low noise so that generally means that
it has a fairly low fin per inch rating
so that means that there's less
turbulence as the air moves through the
fan and overall less noise it also means
you can get better cooling out of it
with a lower airflow fan superior
cooling performance through technology
and that's pretty much marketing's feel
right there alright and
on the other side quiet work and play
environment so they encourage you to use
this both for work and play it uses atc
thermal compound ATC's fans for advanced
thermal compound so it's the advanced
thermal compound thermal compound it is
maintenance-free is prefilled factory
sealed and it does not evaporate you to
the kind of tubing they use so you don't
have to refill it high-performance fluid
heat exchanger so there that's what they
call a cpu block I suppose all right on
the back finally we get quick to install
in any chassis so I will be the judge of
that because usually I can easily find
flaws in these pre-packaged water
cooling products that make it not fit in
a number of chassis so let's get it out
of the box i haven't I mean I saw this
in person briefly at CES but I never got
to actually touch one so all right you
can see that kulit has attached the
styrofoam 'inside to the outer box
extremely well oh come on all right here
we go I found somewhere doesn't pull in
it sort of wow this is um this is one of
the more difficult unboxings I've run
into in quite some time ah here we go
okay come on it's like boxes giving
birth it's a very narrow birth canal Tim
all right there we go the box is off and
I the first thing I find is this piece
of paper which is a quick start guide
and it is a 12 ok tells you what's in
the box and then it's a one two three
step ah configure the retention brackets
so as long as you get it set up for the
right cpu that you're going to be
installing it on you put on a backplate
and then you secure the eco to your pace
and to the into the cpu socket next you
connect a fan and the pound power so
that is kind of more than three steps I
think 30
what can you do this is the AMD
retention bracket so you can see where
that secures to the block and you can
see the spacing is clearly for AMD all
right what do we have next time actually
when I just go ahead and kind of put
those back in there all right next we
have a little elastic around our three
different back plates okay so we have
775 1156 and 1366 it wouldn't be a bad
move probably to do a universal back
plate but um maybe that something was
coming down the road for cool it's
engineering team all right let me just
get this open here and inside the
styrofoam clamshell you can see this is
extremely well packaged check that out
there is nowhere for this thing to move
when it's in transit I really like that
that makes me really happy to see him
taking the care and attention to get you
your product in as good shape as
possible here i'm going to show you the
other side of this too so it's
completely enclosed in there very nice
job kulit okay so it comes in a little
baggie and that'll prevent any
incidental scratches or dings from
happening to your cooler here so let's
get this removed here alright so why
don't we start with the radiator which
is what the DIY water cooling guys would
call this particular piece so it's got a
cool it branded fan on the back I'm just
going to zoom in a little bit closer so
you can see this thing better okay we've
got a cool it branded fan on the back
that spins at you know what they never
actually gave us that in the specs for
this thing good there oh yeah there we
go 1800 rpm max it's right there on the
box I just didn't see it before alright
so 1800 rpm max you can see it is
configured for exhaust so while Corsair
has a comparable product in there the
corsair h50 course I are actually
recommends that you configure the fan
blowing air into the chassis now there
are dead
and disadvantages to both approaches
this one takes hot air from inside your
case and removes it so that means that
rather than taking all that CPU heat and
then pumping it back into your case it
actually removes it from the case now
the disadvantage is it means that you're
not using the coolest possible air to
cool your CPU so in a case like the
corsair obsidian 800d there's an
advantage to turning this fan around
which you can actually do on the cooling
unit or on the corsair it doesn't really
matter and then you could use those top
three fans to blow all the air out and
then you can just bring an extra air it
doesn't really even matter at that point
so if you bring your from the outside
you're using the coolest possible air to
keep your CPU cool you've got a fork in
pwm fan connector here so that'll take
care of making the fans spin all right
this radiator looks fairly bond standard
although they have made a couple small
improvements over once I've seen in the
past first of all this may seem minor
but you see this side this notch right
here most water cooling radiators have
the these are these end tanks go right
from the side of the rad up and then
over and also they can tend to be quite
a bit larger so on the bottom and the
top cool it has made a little bit of
extra space here that right there is
going to give them compatibility with
way more cases right off the bat I've
also seen all-in-one liquid coolers that
are more than the width of a fan now you
can see when you look at the eko the
radiator is exactly flush with the Fen
so for cases that have say for example a
side window that goes right next to the
rear 120 millimeter fan if your
radiators little wider it can hurt your
compatibility there so the eco is pretty
much as close as I've ever seen to
something that can actually achieve
universal compatibility all right cool
it uses their standard plastic tubing
here which is it's good and bad because
it's not very flexible but they must use
it because that's what prevents the
water from evaporating and that's what
makes it so that you don't have to
actually fill this thing repeatedly Oh
they've got actual these are coming
they've got rotating fittings here this
is something new so that's going to give
you a little bit better flexibility when
you're installing the eco
system because you can kind of you know
move it this way or that way before it
was always just putting so much tension
on the fittings but now they've they've
worked out rotation in there that's very
nice okay the pump is powered by a 3-pin
connector so as long as you've got a
couple three pin motherboard connectors
close to your CPU socket you'll be able
to plug in both your fed and your pump
very easily on the bottom of the unit
you can see a nice shiny copper base as
well as a pre applied thermal compound
and then they've got little labels in
the bottom here that what I do don't
think I broke it that's good okay so how
does this work exactly looks like you
lift it up and then you move it oh well
that's kind of cool so what you do is
you actually lift this up and then you
move it around based on which mounting
hole you want to use so just like that
so they've got 775 1156 as well as 1366
all labeled in here and then if you want
to use am too I guess you just um oh
yeah that's what these levels no that
can't be with that's for well I'm sure
that there's a way to do it and it's not
that hard it's in the Quick Start Guide
so if you actually buy this to mount on
an am2 or a m3 motherboard then I'm sure
you'll figure it out anyway thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the you
know what I guess I'm not quite done why
don't I just give a brief mention to the
where the pump is because it used to be
the cool it would integrate their pump
either next to the radiator or next to
the radiator that's where they used to
put their pump and now they've moved to
something that is more of an integrated
all in one unit so the pump as well as
the cpu block are both contained within
this one piece here so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the cool it
