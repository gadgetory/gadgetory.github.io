launch was dominated by coverage of
their new flagship gtx 980 and we were
guilty of focusing on it too but I think
in some ways the lower priced GTX 970
could actually be much more interesting
from a regular gamers perspective
especially if its performance is similar
enough to its beast of a big brother
welcome to our GTX 970 review featuring
the Strix direct co2 from isus
Coolermaster Neptune series CPU coolers
are available in a variety of radiator
sizes to perfectly suit your next build
click now to learn more we'll start with
a brief overview of how the reference
GTX 970 stacks up against the GTX 980
the memory config is identical it's got
the same 256-bit memory bus with the
same four gigs of VRAM clocked at the
same 7 gigahertz but the core is where
NVIDIA has opted to cut their second
tier card down this time around the GTX
970 gets 13 SMS compared to 16 on the
980 giving it about 80% as many cuda
cores and texture units and it comes
with a lower clock speed out of the box
but that's about it
and Asus takes care of one of these
things right off the bat by delivering
their non-reference card with a factory
increased boost clock of 1253 megahertz
actually higher than a reference 980 of
course as usual we aren't going to be
running the card as factories needs
anyway so we're more interested in how
the rest of us uses alterations
including that their latest version of
GPU tweak their overclocking utility
supports automatic GPU BIOS updates on
certain cards now are going to affect
the performance we'll start with a
general physical overview a soos has
increased the height of the card
especially near the sli connector that
supports up to 3-way SLI configurations
they've changed out the dual 6 pin PCI
II connectors for a single 8 pin
connector they've changed the stylized
backplate to a sexy brushed aluminum
job'
they've swapped out the in my opinion
much better IO config for a more
conventional one with DVID dvi-i HDMI
oh and DisplayPort 1.2 ports of which
you can use all four at the same time in
a3 surround and then one auxilary
configuration and finally they've
increased the length of the card
slightly to 11 inches to accommodate the
much larger heatsink design and the
cooler probably deserves its own little
overview here asou says using a dual 92
millimeter triple heat pipe Direct see
you type cooler that means the heat
pipes make direct contact with the GPU
core with an open-air design a suits
220 percent as much overall surface area
compared to reference so this should
give us better card temps compared to a
reference cooler at the cost of internal
system temps if you're not using a case
with solid airflow pulling the cooler
off the card by removing the four screws
around the core at the back reveals one
large ten millimeter diameter heat pipe
flanked by a couple of eight millimeter
ones and this also gives us a better
look at the PCB for the card revealing
the final advantage that non-reference
cards often have over normal ones uses
six phase super alloy power and digital
drm design is made to increase the
lifespan and efficiency of the card and
lower random electrical noise and while
it's difficult for us to observe the
first two directly
especially without a reference 970 to
compare against our experience with asus
directs you cards lately including this
one has been that they are extremely
quiet with no observable coil wine which
leads us to what I think is the coolest
feature of this card and presumably the
one that led to the owl logo for it
the 970 Strix has a zero decimal idle
fan mode so the fan doesn't spin at all
with the system powered on and it can
actually stay off even in games as long
as they aren't very demanding so games
like League of Legends are perfect
candidates for this of course it'll ramp
up like any other card when overclocking
or pushing it hard but it speaks volumes
about the efficiency of the cooler and
the efficiency of the Maxwell based GM
204 GPU that this card is equipped with
that it can do this at all so along with
geforce experience i shadow play game
recording game stream network gaming on
shield devices and automatic game
optimization
driver updates nvidia has added some
very interesting new technologies to 900
series cards including third-generation
delta color compression to make better
use of memory bandwidth dynamic super
resolution a way of running less
demanding or older games at higher res
then down sampling for better visuals
mfa a a less demanding anti-aliasing
mode with pretty much the same visual
quality as MSAA
and auto asynchronous warp a vr feature
that should improve the experience for
users of the oculus rift or similar
head-tracking head-mounted displays who
are prone to motion sickness you can get
more in-depth explanations of these
technologies in my gtx 980 video linked
here for now the big thing we want to
know is how the GTX 970 stacks up
against the competition from a price to
performance standpoint as well as from
an efficiency standpoint
take it away loop alright guys just
reminder that we're running all of our
benchmarks overclocked and that our per
graphics card overclocking settings are
laid out in the graphics card
overclocking dock in the description
below this video
speaking of which first up we have
overclocking do the 970 not being
equipped with the auto balancing power
rails that bless the 780 Ti and 980 the
overclocking of this card is fairly
straightforward apply some voltage
increase the power level allowance jakab
the core in memory clock speeds set a
temp target and voila your hopefully
running at a range of 1403 to 1459 or
above when it finally came to running
actual numbers I was happy with how well
it performed and essentially every test
that slot itself snugly between the 770
and 780 which is good considering it
cost pretty much the same as a 770 but
just like the GTX 980 before it the 970
isn't exactly earth-shattering in terms
of raw performance when compared to the
already existing big dogs but what it is
is a much better value the price per
performance of these cards is much
stronger than previous generation of
heavy hitters and this is especially
true when talking about wattage coming
in at a full system wattage of 305 the
970 is an extremely low power overhead
card which might actually make a
noticeable difference on your power bill
depending on what you're running I'm
looking at you GTX 480 owners and that's
not all this card is running at a
temperature of only 71 degrees while
under load while overclock
not bad at all if you ask me back to you
- alright so with that out of the way it
looks like the GTX 970 is everything we
hoped it would be the 980 is interesting
to folks who have 500 plus dollars to
spend on a GPU but if you're on a
tighter budget or upgrading an older
system both the power efficiency even
you might not want to upgrade to new
power supply and the frankly stunning
performance of the 970 Strix make it a
compelling choice for two and a half K
or even light 4k gaming at a much lower
price than its bigger brother speaking
of much lower prices
nothing is lower than two weeks for
frame so try out Hulu Plus they are the
only streaming service that streams new
current season episodes of popular shows
from ABC Fox NBC and other major

computer so you can use your phone
tablet smart TV Roku or game console to
watch every episode of shows like South
Park and Family Guy you guys have heard
me talk about food plus fool ooh Plus
