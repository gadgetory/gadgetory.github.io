guys today
right here in my hands is a tiny
computer and I do not mean this laptop
we have actually jammed the entire tiny
computer in side the laptop in its hard
drive bay check this out check this out
this crazy that my friend is an entire
computer it's not gonna light your world
on fire or play the latest games at the
highest frame rates but it will run
Windows so let's try that shall we
LTX we're hosting the LTX 2018 live
event on July 14th it's an interactive
Meetup check out and PC gaming
extravaganza get your ticket today at
the link below
so ZOTAC is no stranger to the mini PC
game in fact they've got it
all over their packaging the original
mini PC we made the original we made the
original but even pay have never done
anything this small so this thing is not
much bigger than a credit card I mean
obviously it's thicker but it is not
much larger than a credit card so inside
this device you will find an Intel
Celeron and 3350 processor 4 gigs of RAM
that is ddr3 memory so low-power ddr3
memory you'll find 32 gigs of storage
and surprisingly actually more
expandability than some modern flagship
smartphones like the iPhone so you get
your power button here as well as an
indicator LED you've got your DC 5 volt
3 amp input it's kind of a bummer that
that's a USB micro-b it's not the most
durable connector you've got a microSD
slot so that means that the 32 gigs of
emmc storage that are already soldered
on can be expanded Windows will just see
that as a normal Drive some tablets
already do this like Microsoft Surface
lineup for example and then over here
you've got two USB sees that also serve
as DisplayPort outputs and it even
includes some dongles so this is one of
those situations where because what
you're gonna be able to do with it
depends on the dongles that you've got
for it and unboxing actually kind of
makes sense so we've got one of those
same power - I swear I've seen this
before this is the same one that comes
with the Dropcam we've got a power cord
we've got a little mount so you can
throw this on the back of a monitor or
something like that I guess you just put
like one screw through the base of thing
not the most amazing amount I've ever
seen then you've got a few different
prong options for the power thing here
oh wow so you actually just fold that in
and then do that oh that is a weird
international adapter let's fire it up
shall we
all right so let's plug this in plug
that in plug that baby in hi this
amazing how tiny this thing is also fun
fact the cooling is all taken care of by
the ribbed metal chassis this thing is
completely fanless and it's not even
heavy like it's it's about the same
weight as the SSD that we used for our
size comparison a few minutes ago it's
madness
so with this single dongle that they
include we actually get an HDMI output
and we get 2 USB 3 ports so that'll be
everything that we need to run this
thing that's it that's the whole
computer you know that you've reached
full dongle Ã¤j-- when your dongle is the
size of the computer this is so crazy
like this is a computer wow it's getting
warm already full you're interesting so
I mean first order of business is
obviously Cinebench right no how long
does it take
okay maybe I'll just take Alex's word
for it what's our score sure Wow it is a
dual core without hyper-threading
clocked at a whopping 1.1 gigahertz
I'm gonna guess 2045 okay hey not bad oh
yeah here it is you've already got the
score cache from last time so that is
less than 1/10 the speed of a 5
generation old mobile processor
realistically something like this is
intended more for digital signage
applications or like the POS terminal in
the local clothing store or whatever the
case may be it's designed to be seen not
heard and just perform basic
functionalities so could it do something
like play an HD youtube video because
for better or for worse
intel has baked GPUs onto the vast
majority of their consumer CPUs and
that's annoying
for those of us who just want more CPU
performance in which they use more die
area for that but it's good for people
who want to buy very low-end stuff and
rely on the GPU to accelerate applicable
tasks so let's go ahead and even
scrolling is a little rough got that got
that delay all right let's look up a
really cool channel - tech tips so this
thing's support 4k output oh boy so yes
we are running at 4k right now but only
at up to 30 Hertz so this is HDMI 1.4
not hdmi 2.0 meaning that you're stuck
with a couple of 1920 by 1080 displays
running at 60 Hertz or a single 4k
running at 30 Hertz oh wow the NCIX
bankruptcy auction is still the channel
trailer so this is interesting it's not
a great experience because even like
full screening and then going back to
windowed mode on the video is pretty
choppy oh and we saw we saw hiccup there
but
YouTube actually defaulted to 4k
playback for us here and other than the
fact that the audio is not coming
through which could be any number of
things I'm not going to blame it on this
this is actually playing back pretty
well I bet it's running worm though oh
it is
oh that's toasty it's working hard so
the CPUs not struggling as much when
we're full screened but it has a harder
time when we're running in the browser
now ZOTAC is known for a couple of
things one of them as many pcs but one
of them is overclocking so I wouldn't
put it past them to put some
overclocking capabilities into their
BIOS turbo mode hey oh cool
okay should we enable power limit one no
right let's disable the power limit here
we go
alright we're firing up task manager
let's see if we get so whoa this thing
is running at 2.3 gigahertz now I'm sure
we have no way of guaranteeing that it's
not going to you know overheat without
some additional cooling and to be clear
it's still not super powerful Microsoft
account background task was consuming
40% of the CPU there but maybe this will
give us a little bit more Headroom for
our YouTube experience here Oh
did it just shut down it just oh yeah it
shut down hard I bet we need a more
powerful well wart oh it's really hot
you know if you need additional cooling
though I bet you could just hold the
thing like this
it's like water cooling it with your
blood you know because it'll take the
heat away and then your body will
dissipate it as sweat so I found this
Huawei supercharged adapter down in the
warehouse it claims to be 4.5 volts 5
amps + 5 amps whatever that means but
it's heavy it's definitely not
completely broken so that's good okay do
you want a water cool it for me yeah
like just hold your hand on it uh oh
yeah I guess we could put a fan on it
wait did it just shut down again Oh the
LEDs red well this is one of the risks
of overclocking you don't usually break
your hardware but you do occasionally
corrupt your LS I can feel it heating up
right now as it tries to load Windows
like just went red alright fine we can
disable or enable the power safety thing
all right
but I'm leaving on turbo num locks not
doing anything so the other thing I
don't know is if this thing being rated
for four and a half volts is affecting
it in some way it was worth a shot if I
had one of the old one plus - Chargers
not scripted legitimately didn't realize
that was there
okay we're booted off the - target and
we still have the turbo mode enabled
1.88 100 can we settle for a 100%
overclock Alex yeah we can settle for
that even if Microsoft account
background crap is huh that's still 40%
CPU utilization alright alright let's
wait for that to settle down and then
we'll go ahead and try out youtube again
task manager is pulling 26% of the CPU
interesting so you know what I bet
skiing on here is there's only so much
power for both the CPU and GPU and if we
let the CPU turbo up there's not enough
left to play back 4k video which would
obviously be a priority for a device
like this although yeah it does look
like it's fine now doesn't it so if we
want to run a game we're probably better
off turning off that setting aren't we
good okay let's uh Nover clock and play
some worms shall we I still remember
playing worms 3d on like my buddy's like
Pentium 2 so if this can't handle it I'm
gonna be pretty disappointed
that's a logo I've not enjoyed on my
screen in a while ok that's some pretty
broken stuff right there and none of my
hotkeys work oh that one works test
manager will not come up though
all right so maybe this will let us at
least get to the menus okay that's
different
here we go start a quick game it's only
720p but hey that's running pretty well
oh it's still not actually perfect 60fps
how are you supposed to even control
this this is stupid oh okay and I think
we're done here anyone who thought that
the mouse arrow changing its direction
depending on which direction you were
moving was a good idea I'm glad that
those people are all out of game
development now because that's awful
okay so clearly some of the stuff we did
today was not how the mini PC Z box pi2
25 was intended to be used it's for
industrial applications digital signage
that kind of thing and honestly for that
it's just fine if this was a review I
guess that would be the conclusion it's
not a gaming box and if you were
expecting it to be then you were
unreasonable like me but it would have
been pretty cool if we could have
overclocked it you know what else would
be cool telling you guys about Oh
