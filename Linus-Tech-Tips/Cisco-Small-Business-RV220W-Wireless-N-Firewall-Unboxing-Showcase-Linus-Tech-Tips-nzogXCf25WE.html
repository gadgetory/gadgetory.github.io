small-business RV 220 W this is a
wireless and network security firewall
which basically means that it is a
highly secure and high performance high
reliability it has a lifetime warranty
okay
router with a firewall for small
business so why don't we go ahead and
have a look at what's included with it
first and then we'll talk about it a
little more and maybe do some quick
comparisons to its little little brother
the RV 110 W so the first thing we find
is a read this first disc you might want
to read that first okay next we have a
QuickStart guide shows you how to mount
it to the wall and plug some cables into
it these are all good things
next we have a lead the female has my
feet so that would be in French next we
have the firewall unit itself I'm going
to go ahead and pull that out for now
and then we'll see what other
accessories we can find in the
eco-friendly packaging by the way very
nice appreciate that always helps when
everyone's doing their part to save the
environment and I mean this actually is
oftentimes more expensive to produce
than a phone based insert because
someone has to actually fold this
believe it or not so so yeah getting the
guys made up for for the packaging for
something like this is not not cheap it
does cost money to be eco-friendly this
thing feels like a tank holy smokes
alright so the RV 220 W let's have a
look at the unit itself before we talk
about what makes it special I'm going to
throw these antennas on here on the back
comes with two antennas these are user
replaceable so you could swap them out
for other antennas should you desire
okay so the front of the unit here we
have a power LED we have a diagnostic
LED we have a demilitarized zone
indicator we have a wireless indicator
we've also got indicators for the speed
of the various land port so these go up
to gigabit and
the LAN port is also gigabit what part
of what makes this guy special is it is
capable according to Cisco spec of
delivering
up to 800 megabit per second throughput
between the land and the land ports so
what that means is you could have an
internet connection that is almost
gigabit down and you would be able to
fully almost fully utilize it using a
router such as this one we've got some
ventilation holes on this side we've got
some ventilation holes on the other side
here on the bottom we find some rubber
non-slip feet as well as options to
mount it on the wall either this way or
this way whatever you should desire and
then on the back we find a power switch
our power input which dinner not even
show you the power adapter in the
ethernet cable it comes with sorry about
that guys there they are our four LAN
ports so as I mentioned before gigabit
and our Gigabit LAN port as well as a
hard reset button now this guy also has
802.11 2.4 gigahertz five gigahertz dual
band wireless and so you can obviously
use it for wireless although the
performance you're going to get out of
this is going to be predominantly wired
because it is a gigabit router but if
you are using Wireless in your office it
can be handy to have that option as well
and then let's talk a little bit about
some of the other features that it has
that make it neat so they are v2 20w
because it's for business and every
business needs reliability is all about
security and reliability you do not want
downtime so between the Cisco forum
which is an online support community for
small businesses to come together and
talk to other Cisco customers and
partners you can get support that way
you also have support directly from
Cisco on a product like this and
compared to its little brother you have
the same security features including
hybrid VPN with SSL and IPSec
capabilities but more so so for example
where the rv1 10w supports only five
IPSec connections this little guy while
little guy should really say it's a
little guy weighs like a couple pounds
actually supports 25 connections and it
also has as I mentioned before a limited
lifetime warranty whereas it's littler
brother at about a third of the price
only has a three-year warranty and I
shouldn't really say only because most
consumer routers only come
one year warranties so thank you for
checking out my first look at the RV 220
