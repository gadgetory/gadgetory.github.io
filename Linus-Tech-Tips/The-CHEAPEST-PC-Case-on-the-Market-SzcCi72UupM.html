that is only 13 dollars plus a few bucks
for shipping well if I'm being honest
not enough for us but here at LTT we are
all about cramming as much power as
possible into anything that comes
through the door so of course this baby
needed some major modifications
the Corsair one features a compact form
factor that is fast quiet and you
guessed it compact check it out through
Amazon or Newegg at the links below so
the experience of buying this case then
you really do get what you pay for
sometimes when it arrived I told Alex
gee man I really wish we'd ordered the
black version and he responds well you
actually don't get to pick a color it's
just luck of the draw brilliant
first impressions though it's
considerably smaller than we thought in
the description it does say mini ITX
case and it does say POS but it doesn't
say anything about being so small that
it doesn't even have a mount for a power
supply to its credit B doesn't even have
a model number no all right then
the construction of the small exclusive
custom is pretty solid compared to some
of the other cheap cases that we've had
around here so the first aid kit stayed
where it belongs above the fridge
missing screws and lack of instructions
aside for $13.50 it's hard to complain
about much besides the size we went
about seeing then what all we could fit
in this thing fortunately we had a Pico
power supply on hand so we built a
system in it with that but frankly it
kind of sucked at only about 60 watts
and with a four pin connector that we
janked together there was just no way
that this thing was going to end up
Linus tech tips grade which isn't to say
that we didn't try but our core i7 7700
K had to be under clocked to three
gigahertz from 4.5 and have half of its
cores disabled and even then it was so
questionably stable that it didn't even
post downstairs where the lighting and
construction going on right now mean
that the wall power isn't as clean no if
we're going to build a worthy system in
here we're going to need a little bit of
inspiration from roadkill plus the angle
grinder man is knocking at the door and
it seems rude not to let him in so we
went down to the workshop in planned oh
where the cuts
need to be in the top of the case using
calipers and rulers to aid our
measurements given we only have one of
these cases it wasn't they measure once
cut for rice kind of situation after
marking out the cuts we bought out the
aluminum cutting disk and went to work
and wow it seems to fit so we actually
wanted to reuse the drive mounting that
came with the case but inverted so that
we could use it to hold our HD flex 300
watt DC to DC power supply that we stole
from the s4 mini so we wanted that
underneath the case so we got us a
center punch and slammed out the rivets
with only a little bit of massaging
needed afterwards to get it perfect then
the standoffs were screwed back on the
bottom making a nice little compartment
the chopped chopping wasn't over yet
though we needed to make space for the
power supply cables to enter the case
and for the PCI Express extender to
leave so we marked the cuts out and got
the grinder going once again now we just
needed some mounting for the GPU a gtx
1080 of course we decided the easiest
way to mount it was using this adapter
stolen from the compact sli rig project
or therethe which conveniently bolted
right onto the existing cuts in the case
so no other modifications had to be made
reassembly could have been easier
everything had to go back in exactly the
right order or we'd have to perform the
disassembly of Shame first we attached
our little power supply to the underside
of the case using our preferred mounting
method double-sided tape the 24 pin
connector on it was particularly ugly so
we covered that up using cable mod a IO
sleeving not a perfect solution but it
does look a lot better next we attached
the SSD to the mount on the bottom the
drive mounting that came with this case
is actually pretty bad and doesn't allow
for right angle SATA connectors but we
were able to make it work even if we
could only put in two screws because it
had to sit kind of a
angle the GPU got slotted in and we were
ready to put the top on so with the CPU
fan getting plugged in first and then
screwing down the cooler we just needed
to add some finishing touches and a lazy
cable management job and she was finally
ready for action overall we're actually
pretty pleased with the cheapest case on
the market I mean it would obviously be
misleading to call our end result here
representative of its $13 price tag
because by the time we had actually
built our system we had used an
expensive AC to DC wall adapter and
expensive 300 watt DC to DC power supply
an expensive shielded PCI Express
extension expensive modding tools and a
custom bracket that we didn't fabricate
but cooling performance is obviously
great since it's pretty much all open
air and we think it looks flippin
awesome this is one of mass drops most
exciting drops to date masked off and
high-five n have teamed up to bring you
the he4 xx headphones high efficiency
open backed planar magnetic drivers that
don't need a fancy amp to sound great
the sound profile is smooth engaging and
even across the frequency range and they
feature high v men's focus a hybrid ear
pads so the foam is made of like a soft
velour but it has extra cushioning and
is specifically angled for optimal
acoustics
other features include soft touch matte
finish adjustable sliders spring steel
and hand-stitched protein leather on the
headband and an exclusive midnight blue
color it's available and this is the
best part for one $69.99 us for only a
