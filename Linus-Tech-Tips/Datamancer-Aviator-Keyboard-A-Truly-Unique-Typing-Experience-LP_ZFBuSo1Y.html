something as entirely unique as the data
man sir aviator keyboard that I have in
front of me today
and that's really saying something since
in my position I get access to all kinds
of really cool stuff this is different
the Coolermaster Nova touch tkl is
powered by doper hybrid capacitive
switches for the ultimate typing
experience and is now available for a
reduced price click my face to learn
more let's start with an overview of who
exactly data mansur is since you've
probably never heard of them
data answer is a bit of a ragtag group
of keyboard artisans many of which are
students some of which were prodigies of
the late Richard doc Nagi who was the
original founder of the company and was
responsible for most of the designs so
the way it works is rather than mass
producing keyboards and putting them in
boxes and then selling them through your
local store like a normal company data
mansur treats each keyboard more like an
art piece commissioned that they then
build to order according to the user
specifications now for me that was a bit
tricky since I basically said my
favorite key switches are Cherry MX
browns but other than that I'd like you
to surprise me
so they played it safe and went with
their simple yet classically styled
aviator which I guess will take a tour
of now the unboxing experience was
pretty exciting it's hard for me to get
amped up about some new gadget these
days sometimes but I was genuinely dying
to open this puppy up and play with it
it comes carefully wrapped in bubble
wrap with a nondescript Brown box around
it no accessories our documentation
whatsoever but then again if you
expected that and thought you were
getting a multilingual instruction
manual from a company with two full-time
people then a get real and B what on
earth do you need an instruction manual
for just plug the nice supple paracord
style sleeved USB thing into the other
USB thing and it's off to the races
frankly the coolest thing about opening
the Aviator for the first time was
something I wasn't expecting the smell
it doesn't smell like new toy you know
that plastic smell or even new PCB it
smells like wood and metalworking and
soldering it smells like someone made it
for you and it amazed me what a
different smell made to my perception of
the product not like I didn't know that
someone makes it for you mean according
to data man sir every single keyboard
project is chosen by an individual
it is in who then you is usually the
only person working on it as its hand
assembled over a period of about 24
hours after which time it is inspected
by the team before it is deemed worthy
of being sent out to a client so what is
it exactly that my art isn't worked on
then well we'll start with the housing
the bottom is made of a burnt finish
wood that when reinforced by the
internal PCB and brushed aluminum frame
around it provides a stable backplate
surface with no perceivable flex as I
was typing on the keyboard on the sides
we get a better look at the
aforementioned
brushed aluminum frame that uses a thick
curved aluminum plate on each side with
holes that looked kind of drilled out to
allow modular assembly to other
components to achieve this unique
utilitarian look then near the back of
the keyboard there are two triangular
pieces in a similar style that act as
the feet for the keyboard I actually
kind of hoped that folding them down
would allow me to flatten out the
keyboard on the desk surface a little
bit but the Aviator is intended to be
used with the feet in one position only
so let's talk about using it then each
key cap is hand assembled from four
pieces the stem that installs on a
standard Cherry MX key switch the
lettering that appears to be simply
printed on an inkjet printer the concave
plastic lens that sits over top of that
to protect it and finally the metal ring
around the outside edge to create a very
unique look and feel for starters it
really is more like using a typewriter
to click away on this style of key cap
is much less tolerant of miss tropes
than a square one and this is
particularly true in the case of keys
that would normally be larger with
stabilizers or other components that
might look unsightly on a design such as
this like the shift in the enter Keys
something that stood out to me though is
how smooth they felt under my fingers
the seam between the lens and the metal
ring is almost impossible to feel unless
you really go looking for it and the
rounded feeling to them means that you
never touch a sharp corner while you're
typing on the keyboard anywhere under
the keys is a leather covered backplate
a fun little factoid by the way is that
data mansur uses either tandy Leather or
pieces from antique furniture that
combined with the
battleframe gives it an incredibly
handmade look and feel that even would
wouldn't have achieved quite as well the
crown jewel or jewels of the aviator is
the fender jewels that handle number
lock scroll lock and caps lock
indication in the top right corner
alright so I said a lot of good stuff
about the aviator let's get to the
rougher stuff shall we
this is a very very expensive keyboard I
mean there are lots of expensive
keyboards but unlike many of the others
a datum answer cannot sell itself for
any practical reason the typing
experience while unique is not as
comfortable as a mass-produced keyboard
with the wrist rest adjustable angles
larger keys and the internals are
decidedly unremarkable with no fancy
macro functionality and not even n key
rollover to boast about it appears to be
six keys plus modifiers for my testing
but I also believe that those comments
would mean very little to the kind of
customer who's interested in buying one
of these it's not a practical purchase
and nobody ever tried to claim it was
this is a luxury item for people who are
willing to buy it simply as a showpiece
or for the unique experience and from
the very moment I unboxed it to the time
I'm standing here telling you about it
now using it has been a unique
experience I have to give them that so
guys thanks for watching like this video
if you liked it just like it if you
thought it sucked leave a comment on our
forum linked in the video description if
you have feelings that are more
complicated than that also linked in the
video description we have a merch store
where you can buy a cool t-shirt like
this one a contribution link where you
can give us the contribution if you
think what we're doing is important and
the link where you can change your
Amazon bookmarked one with our affiliate
code so we get a small kickback whenever
you buy stuff on Amazon that kind of
stuff helps us out a lot thanks again
for watching and as always don't forget
to Like and subscribe and follow and all
that good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
