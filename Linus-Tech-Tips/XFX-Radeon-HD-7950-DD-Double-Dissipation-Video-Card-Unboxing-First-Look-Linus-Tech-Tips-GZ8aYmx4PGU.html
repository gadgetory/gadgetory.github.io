that's actually fairly exciting this is
the Radeon HD 7950 this is a bit of a
step down from the 7970 but they haven't
actually reduced the performance that
much so today not only do I have a
Radeon HD 7950 to unbox and take a bit
of a look at but I have the particularly
special one so this is the XFX double D
and that is not to say that it goes here
necessarily but rather to say that it is
double dissipation so that means they've
put um about an aftermarket cooler on
what is otherwise still a reference 7950
so you can rest assured that you're
getting the quality that goes along with
that a reference board or whatever else
but you are also getting two fans for
removing heat from your card so what
does XFX have to say about it let's go
with that first and then we'll open up
the card itself so it has three gigs of
memory for max effect and resolutions
I'm sure they need effects and
resolutions but be out basically what
that means is that if you're running
even three monitors in Eyefinity mode
you're going to have enough of a frame
buffer in order to not suffer from a
serious performance leg that results
when the graphics memory fills up and
you have to go to your hard drive which
is slow or even system memory or
anywhere else is slower than graphics
memory next generation performance they
are very correct about that even though
this is not a top-of-the-range card it
does perform as well or better than
nvidias premium GTX 580 ghost thermal
maximizes airflow for exceptional
venting throughout the card that's
interesting we'll have to have a look at
that what else we got here multi monitor
difference yeah okay so it does support
high affinity it's up to four monitors
unique dual fan design allows air to
cool everything including including
thermal including GPU heat sinks
components in the PCB board so that I'll
believe
okay unless we got here five-star
support register your product and get
industry-leading five-star support yeah
make sure you register okay Jen ultra
bandwidth K pcie 3.0 yes it does have
pcie 3.0 so we'll talk about that a
little bit more after okay tessellation
bullet physics engine resident textures
okay these are probably kind of extreme
examples but basically more better than
before Hydra sells thermal solution
interesting condensation wicks
evaporation wicks okay so they're
talking about basically what are they
called again vapor chambers yep it's
burial thermal perfect for overclocking
okay cool let's get it opened up first
we have a little brochure for their Pro
Series power supplies other great XFX
products including adapters hardware
limited warranty let's have a look at
okay so they want you to go and check it
out on XFX course comm quick install
guide driver CD install guide okay and
there's the driver CD next we've got a
crossfire bridge as well as an HDMI to
DVI adapter that's an interesting one
you don't see that included with video
cards very often we've also got one of
XFX is trademark door hangers I've
actually got one in there in this room
over here check it out this is an older
one this is from backline XFX did Nvidia
graphics cards but there's a no I've
another one to go with it
pretty cool these are handy because they
also keep your serial number and all
that cool information on the back of it
so that means that you can not have to
pull the card out of your system if you
ever need to look anything up on the X
festival XFX website or register it or
whatever else so let's open up the
double dissipation 7950 and have a look
at it so these are two as he's 90 mill
fans hold on a sec sorry so yes that is
292 92 milf Ann's over a huge Wow look
at this oh this is interesting so this
is what they mean by this over a huge
heatsink hour
so you can see the heat sink goes all
the way from here down to here it's got
a bit of a stepped appearance going on
so that means it can benefit not only
from the air that is blowing directly
down onto the PCB but also some of that
incidental airflow that comes from
around the edge of the spinning fan so
you can see they built up the heatsink
in these areas in order to take
advantage of that you can see we've got
a sleeved connector here that provides
power for 1-2 fans and then you can see
what they mean this is their this is
their interesting cooler design here so
they've actually left it quite open
around the bottom of the card so here's
our PCI Express 3.0 16x slot and what
that means is that some of the
incidental airflow from these fans is
going to cool not only the graphics card
itself but also your motherboard below
it now with some last generation
products from both the AMD and the
Nvidia side a design like this wasn't
really an option because they needed all
the airflow possible from these fans in
order to keep the graphics card cool
enough but the 7950 is actually
significantly cooler running and more
efficient than some of these last
generation products due to the improved
manufacturing process so we're able to
take advantage of some of this airflow
and use it to cool the rest of your
system and ensure that not only does
your graphics card run stable but so
does your entire PC on the back you can
see the other the the end of this
aluminum shroud goes right here on the
top this is a very nice touch check this
out so not only you can see it's quite
open you can see those fan blades in
there see me spinning them so that same
that same kind of thinking although I
don't see how it's nearly as beneficial
here but I guess what it does is it also
provides less restriction for the fans
overall so not only can you exhaust air
out the back of the card not so much out
this side but out here you can also
exhaust all the air from your fans all
around the card which means that they're
not going to be very restricted but XFX
has included instead of a plastic accent
here they've included an aluminum accent
it's got kind of a brushed finish to it
just like the rest of the cooler that
looks very very sharp it's branded with
their ghost thermal technology bit here
as well as their XF
XR 7950 thing that's going on here the
good news about this entire cooler is
that none of the numbers can fall off
like I had happened during my 7970
unboxing video now let's have a look at
the back of this card this is not a
reference board so I was mistaken this
is an aftermarket cooler on an
aftermarket board it looks like they're
probably using the reference design but
this is clearly an XFX style matte black
PCB so there you go guys
I stand corrected on that you can see
all of the memory chips are installed on
the other side of the PCB so that's
three gigs of RAM over there our VRMs
are here our power is here you can see
there are pin outs for a six pin and an
eight pin but the card itself due to its
lower power requirements compared to the
7970 only uses dual six pins we've got
two cross fire connectors so that is for
well connecting to other cards to run in
crossfire I've already talked about the
PCI Express 3.0 so that is gen 3 PCIe
connector on the bottom but what I
should also mention is that it is fully
backwards compatible with the PCI
Express gen 2 or even PCI Express gen1
motherboard so don't worry about that
although if you go all the way back to
Gen 1 board you're probably going to be
bottlenecking this graphics card with
the interface itself however this
graphics card is still but I mean when
it's saturating a PCIe Gen 1 interface
is still going to be more than any CPU
that runs on that motherboard is going
to be able to keep up with anyway so the
bottleneck will still exist on the CPU
side not with the PCI Express interface
so now let's go ahead and have a look at
what we've got for inputs and outputs
all I see why we have an HDMI to DVI
adapter it's so that we can easily run
dual DVI since most people running two
displays are using that and then with 4
displays you can go either DVI HDMI mini
DisplayPort mini DisplayPort or DVI DVI
via adapter mini DisplayPort mini
DisplayPort we've got a little XFX
branded exhaust slot going on there and
I think that pretty much covers it so
what is the benefit of the 7950 well the
79
is cheaper than the 7970 we've covered
that already over clocks like a beast
even though the reference stock clock
speed is only 800 megahertz these cards
have been seen already going up around
the 1,000 megahertz or 1 gigahertz mark
so what that means is we're looking at
20 to 25% over clocks on an enthusiast
level graphics card it hasn't been seen
in a fair a while so I guess not only
did AMD achieve better thermal
performance and better power consumption
with their new manufacturing process but
also better overclocking Headroom so
