tech tips I actually have one of the
applicants from my new assistant
position holding the camera from you
today and we are going to be unboxing
his pick of all the things that are in
the room right now to on box and that is
the NZXT havoc 140 this is a new cooler
from NZXT now their claim is it actually
performs as well as the noctua NHD 14
but looks cooler in their opinion on
though I do have to say that with those
blades on the fan and that finish on the
heat sink itself it does look pretty
darn cool let's see what they have to
say for themselves we've got
compatibility for socket 1155 1156 and
775 as well Zane 3am 2 plus am too and
remember that also means it's compatible
with am3+ because it will use the same
mounting system specially designed
rubber fasteners to reduce vibration and
secure fans to heat sink all right
unique fan blades provide quiet 25
decibel operation highly effective
airflow very nice ok 6 6 millimeter heat
pipes with standard dual 1 40 millimeter
fans for most efficient conductivity
sturdy mounting bracket newly patented
thins exceptionally slice passing air
for increased ventilation now I thought
these were just to look cool but I guess
there's only one way to know for sure a
hundred percent soldered copper basin
aluminum fence with nickel plating to
ensure resilience against deterioration
quality and long life I hope that it
doesn't have resilience against long
life and I really hope that they were
actually talking about just the
resilience against the deterioration and
never mention there so let's go ahead
and break the seal because that's what
we do on this channel and how do I open
the box I don't know from the bottom oh
there's another seal alright we get to
break the seal twice on this product
exciting so let's see what NZXT has
inside so the first thing we find is a
manual it's not in color although I'm
not really sure that color manuals are
necessary expense for coolers especially
when you have a nice blown-up diagram
like this that shows you where all the
parts are going to go in order to
install it on the intel or AMD system
okay on this side we've got our
step-by-step although I mean just for
quickness sake you're probably gonna
want to use oh no these are just parts
lists I thought are these in order I can
tell let me see yeah yeah those look
like they're in order of how it's held
down so at the end it's held down by a
spring mounted bit and then it's just a
matter of which mounting hardware you're
putting over the socket of your
motherboard so first thing we find is a
fan packed in very nice closed cell foam
so there's definitely no risk of damage
to that fans got a very short connector
on it and it's got blacks leaving as
well as a black connector so it should
match your hardware fairly well these
are 140mm fans but they use that cool
circular frame design which allows them
to mount on 120 millimeter mounts
compared to the square frame which would
put those mounting bowls a little bit
further out alright we've got another
fan much like the last one except more
different alright we have some do not
eat desiccant silica gel alright don't
eat that please and then we have okay
hold on let's have a look at the
mounting hardware first and then we'll
do this the cpu cooler itself so in
terms of accessories we've got a bunch
of stuff here so you've got what looks
like look at how thick that back plate
is here let's take that out alright then
what are these these are rubber
fasteners huh cool okay so we've got one
two three four of those so these robber
fasteners are what allow us to mount the
fans to the cooler alright we've got
some various back plates and hold down
mechanisms these are very very thick
check this out if you manage to warp a
motherboard with one of these installed
on it then you're probably doing it
wrong this is the side for AMD look how
thick that thing is hair will do the
will do the iphone thickness comparison
that you guys all love so much there you
go so it's about the thickness of the
glass on an iPhone all right so you got
some plastic bits here just to make sure
that it doesn't short out on your
motherboard okay we've got some
additional hold down pieces all made out
of nice thick steel so you're not going
to have any difficulty
with those bending or coming loose and
shipping that can be a big concern with
these heavy heat sinks because
especially for NCIX I mean when we're
shipping systems across the country it
can be problematic if the system heat
sink comes loose in transit and bangs
around inside which has happened believe
me and it's very very very bad all right
there we go let's take out the heat sink
itself and have a look lots and lots of
heat pipes in this thing this actually
reminds me of the thermal right ultra
120 extreme a little bit although more
heat pipes for sure then the ultra 120
extreme had so there's actually six heat
pipes which are all bent in AU
configuration it's got kind of a matte
silver finish and then you can see that
it's actually a fairly loose thin array
so my expectation is that this is this
cooler is going to perform best with low
rpm fans which is indeed what NZXT has
supplied with it so let's have a look at
how they've laid out the heat pipes here
so you can see we have the six coming
through on each side and then they
either bend in like this or they Bend
not quite as much or they come out to
the edge of the cooler now one good
thing about a cooler like this versus
something like a d14 regardless of
performance because we haven't had a
look at performance yet is that it is
going to be more compatible with a wider
variety of motherboards compared to a
monstrosity like the d14 which is
basically like two of these side by side
where you can put a fan in the middle
and a fan on either side so it's got
some heft to it but again with this
mounting mechanism I really wouldn't
expect to run into any trouble with it
putting it too much strain on your
motherboard we can do the obligatory
finger shot here so you can see it's got
some shininess to it although there is
some definite some definite grain to the
finish on the bottom although that does
not necessarily impact performance in
any way now in terms of mounting these
fans you notice that they had very very
short connectors on them so I just want
to show you guys why that is it's
because we actually have any
splitter so you just go ahead hook both
fans up to the splitter that came with
it so you can put those on either side
there we go whoops okay well it'll go
kind of something like that you hook up
the splitter and then you hook the whole
thing up to your motherboard so this is
what it will look like let's do about
the fans on it it's about this big and
we can do another iphone shot just so
that you guys can see the overall size
of the unit itself in comparison to an
iphone and I think that pretty much
covers everything I wanted to say about
the havoc 140 don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips and thank you for
checking out my unboxing your first look
at this new heatsink which is actually
the first heat sink for NZXT so here's
actually how these rubber mounting
mechanisms work you take them and you
screw them into the not screw them you
put them into the fan like this and then
you take these rubber bits here and then
you pull them around the edge of where
you would normally have like a mounting
bar which is what we see on something
like a thermal right cooler now they are
a little bit tricky to get in there and
I wouldn't mind if NZXT also included a
mounting bar to go along with the rubber
pieces but basically you put them behind
their on both sides you have to kind of
you know if I i guess if we took like
like a screw or something and sort of
push that in there then we might have a
little bit better luck the good news is
you only have to do this once I guess
there we go so you put it under there
and then that is what holds the fan on
so you take four of those and then you
can actually see that there's going to
be a significant buffer between the fan
and the heat sink itself which acts to
help reduce the dead zone which is the
area in the middle of the fan where
there's obviously no airflow as well as
reducing the vibration that can be
transferred from the fan to the heatsink
to the motherboard to your case</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
