from avermedia many of you expressed
dissatisfaction with its 1080p 30fps
recording limitation and asked why the
devil we didn't talk about the extreme
cap u3 CD 710 instead because it can
record 1080p 60fps sorry about that
here it is with the purchase of a
qualifying Intel processor SSD or nook
you could instantly win and Intel gaming
Jersey and be entered in the draw for
the ultimate system click now to learn
more now because with motion blur 30fps
delivers smooth video playback most
online video platforms notably YouTube
have up until this point been limited to
30 fps so even if you could capture at a
higher framerate you wouldn't be able to
publish to your viewers that way anyway
without some pretty janky workarounds
well all of that is about to change
so the 60 FPS argument becomes one
that's much more important and a low
cost 60 FPS capture device could
suddenly be a critical piece of
equipment particularly for game
streamers who focus on action-oriented
games and that's what we have here at
around 150 dollars the extreme cap u3
does 1080p 60fps capture from a camera a
separate PC or from a game console
assuming you can find one that actually
runs games at 60fps like the Wii U but
considering that it has only one HDMI
input with no pass-through and one
analog component input is it capable of
competing with the 2560 by 1440 60fps
recording that Nvidia shadowplay users
already and joy well the answer is a
definite maybe one big benefit of a
standalone capture device is the ability
to use it as a video source for your
favorite streaming software like xsplit
so I'm a big fan of AVerMedia live gamer
portable for that reason back to this
product though unlike the live gamer
portable it doesn't have a hardware
h.264 encoder chip so your CPU will be
doing the work it doesn't have the handy
on unit record button and it doesn't
have HDMI pass-through and while
avermedia claims that dude
the USB 3 interface the latency is so
low that you should be able to output
via HDMI to the CV 710 then play off the
preview window in practice I found that
even using a validated USB 3 chipset
note that not all recording modes will
be available on non-validated USB 3
chipsets this setup didn't work that
well the leg was very noticeable to me
and I also observed more screen tearing
than usual
now a solution to this would be to use
an HDMI splitter which can be obtained
for about 20 bucks on Amazon which is
more pieces though and more wires to
contend with but still manages to come
in under $200 for a 60fps live streaming
and capture solution for console gamers
or PC gamers who don't want to use a
screen capture software or a separate
recording PC but there are some other
issues too after you run the USB port
validation wizard while rec central is
actually pretty darn solid and amazingly
easy to set up with either one-click
detection of your video source or a
wizard that lets you configure bitrate
frame rate whether your commentary audio
will be mixed in or saved as a separate
file and you're recording hockey one big
thing that's missing with this device is
the ability to capture at 29.97 FPS or
59.94 FPS the frame rates that most
consumer AV equipment will use now to be
clear it does work this is internally
recorded and simultaneously captured
footage from a Canon X 820 camera they
are just at slightly different frame
rates which may cause audio sync issues
when editing very long videos on a
timeline unless you reconfirm your
footage ahead of time so it's not a huge
deal it just makes the extreme cap u 3 a
bit of a weird device for me for console
gamers it's fine but so is a live gamer
portable in most cases and for PC gamers
I'd have liked to see a 1440 30 P
capture option and HDMI pass-through and
then for someone who's more interested
in uncompressed video capture from AV
equipment something that handles easily
with Premiere and Vegas plugins
available for free although some
kajigger may be required to get it going
in Creative Cloud I'd have
to see native support for the more media
centric frame rates which doesn't make
it a bad product at all at this price
you cannot get a 60fps capture device
with this kind of ease of you some
versatility it even works on Mac it just
feels like a version 2 of this product
for a few bucks more with those little
niggles taking care of would be much
more compelling speaking of compelling
we have a brand new sponsor on today's
episode bowls and they are currently
offering a pretty ridiculous deal on a
very useful product I am Oh bowls
provides a wide variety of different
products from wireless adapters and
Bluetooth speakers to the one that we're
highlighting today they're brand new
seven port USB charger which is
exceptional because with its rating of
60 watts or 12 amps you can
simultaneously charge five power-hungry
devices like tablets at full speed it's
equipped with overcharge protection and
each port features an overcurrent
over-voltage and short circuit protector
the charger also features smart IC
technology which automatically
determines the perfect charge and
charging speed for each device giving
every device an OEM quality charge this
is ideal for anyone who travels with a
bunch of devices or with a large group
we will definitely be bringing this with
us on our trips to packs and CES the
bull seven port USB chargers normally
49.99 also known as $50 especially
because Canada's gotten rid of the penny
but as a special offer they're making
marking it down to only 36 dollars which
is an absolute steal for a product like
this we've actually featured similar
stuff to this that's higher priced that
I also thought was awesome so this is
like yeah it's like plus more awesome -
more dollars so be sure to check it out
