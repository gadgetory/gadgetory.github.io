bizarre components for an upcoming
project and we stumble across a series
of really cheap SSDs from a company
called King spec which kind of sounds
like a knockoff of Kingston and this
raised a couple of questions for us one
how can they be cheaper than massive
multinationals like Samsung or micron
who enjoy the industry's best economies
of scale how would something like this
perform and perhaps most importantly
should anyone trust what is probably the
most valuable aspect of their computer
their data to a relatively unknown
player oh oh and one more question have
you ever heard of our sponsor glass wire
glass wire lets you see your current and
past network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device use offer code Linus to
get 25% off at the link below
first things first the on paper
specifications which getting our hands
on was actually not as easy as you might
think so the official page lists neither
the controller so that's effectively the
brain of an SSD that controls how data
is managed on the NAND flash nor the
exact type of NAND flash that was used
by the stripe furthermore when we
cross-referenced whatever data was out
there in the wild often on third-party
sites we actually found a ton of
conflicting information everything from
different NAND types and LCD versus TLC
two wildly swinging sequential read and
write ranges in some cases we actually
found conflicting information within the
same page now we were able to determine
at least that the controller on our
particular unit was probably a dear
analyst model from max EOTech which is J
microns SSD division that was spun off
into a separate entity and that it's
probably an NK 8 1 1 5 but we decided to
leave confirming it until all the
testing was complete just in case our
autopsy found that the patient was
deceased
due to the autopsy okay so for those of
us who are not quite up to speed on what
makes an SSD tick aside from the like
you plug it look in and it makes the
loading low faster and why being be
round list is important
here's a quick primer when your
operating system sends a write request
to an SSD it actually assumes even
though it's 2018 that it is talking to a
hard drive and sends data in logical
block address or Lda form now SSDs they
don't do LBA instead storing data in
blocks which each contain four kilobyte
pages so that's where the flash
translation layer inside the SSD comes
in it converts lb
requests into actual block and page
addresses acting as sort of a table of
contents what's more each NAND cell has
a finite number of times that it can be
overwritten so there needs to be logic
inside the SSD that takes care to spread
out the where evenly this is a process
known as we're leveling further
complicating this process though an
individual page cannot be erased from a
block so to remove part of the data from
one block the whole block has to be
moved over to a second one - the pages
containing parts of the file that are
marked for deletion once that's done the
first block can be marked as safe to
overwrite now this consolidation or
moving around is known as garbage
collection and SSDs have at least 7% of
their true capacity hidden sometimes
more in order to help shuffle data
around this is otherwise known as
over-provisioning now as you can imagine
as an SSD gets more filled up with data
this garbage collection process gets
more difficult because the fewer spare
blocks you have the harder it is to
organize the ones that remain especially
during heavy use when it has to perform
this shuffling on-the-fly
this is where not having a dram cache
can hurt you remember that table of
contents we talked about ideally that
gets stored on the cache so then without
a fast way to look up where what goes
writing data to a dear Alice SSD ends up
being kind of like going to the mall
without a directory and then imagine
you're in a hurry like you're doing
random writes of small files all over
the drive which actually happens a lot
during regular usage or or does it so
let's look at some performance here oh
oh oh wow oh
manatee sorry okay enough of that let's
actually look a little closer at those
numbers in sequential reads and writes
from a clean state everything here
actually looks fine but the same can be
an SD card and when we ran windows on
one of those recently the results were
well less than ideal but we're our kings
BEC SSD falls flat on its face is where
small size transfers come in so we're
talking being beat by an order of two
and a half times in some cases and then
embarrassingly enough this model we're
comparing it to right here is also a
cashless model this time from Corsair so
it seems to be a mix of the who knows
what manned and the cheap-ass controller
along with an unexceptional firmware and
that is with the drives empty and
trimmed this situation can only get
worse as the drive fills up game level
load times could be seen as a redeeming
quality those are fine but honestly by
this stage of our testing they just
aren't enough for King spec to be
getting any kind of recommendation for
this drive especially given the mix down
as on reviews that are either basically
yay works great or died quickly no
response from the RMA team with someone
even going as far as to set up a
complaints page about King spec the
final nail in the coffin is the price so
our no-name SSD is cheap sure at the
time we ordered it it was the cheapest
512 gig that we could find but cheap is
not the same thing as good value so
given that something like a Samsung 860
Evo can be had for complete with five
year warranty by the way about ten
dollars more and I guess the conclusion
is this I recommend the Kings back p3
512 I strongly recommend it as a gift
for someone you don't like speaking of
things I recommend as a gift although in
this case for someone you really like
mass drops Sennheiser HD 6 xx headphones
this is one of mass drops all-time
bestsellers and why wouldn't it be
over 40,000 of their members have picked
these things up to date and people
continue to walk them it uses
the legendary HD 650 drivers as a base
to deliver a balanced mid-range and
natural sounding bass it's got a
detachable six-foot cable instead of the
10-foot cable on the original this is
based on the community's feedback and it
comes with support from Sennheiser so
check out the link below to join the
drop today so thanks for watching guys
if you just like this video you can hit
that button but if you liked it hit like
and subscribe maybe consider checking
out we're gonna buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should definitely join to be clear we're
not really recommending this one you're
just saying this one is really bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
