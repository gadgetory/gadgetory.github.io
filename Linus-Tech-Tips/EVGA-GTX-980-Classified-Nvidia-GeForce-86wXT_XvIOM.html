out for a little bit now and while we've
been tied up with things like the
mineral oil project we thought better
late than never so here we go by the way
I suggest you guys stay subscribed as a
little bird may have told me that whole
room water cooling part one is probably
coming soon
from December 13th to 20th 2014 you can
save on select until CPU Schnucks and
SSDs with special holiday rebates from
select retailers click now to learn more
let's start with a brief overview of how
the reference gtx 980 stacks up against
the gtx 980 classified EVGA has
increased the effective memory clock of
their 4 gigabytes of vram by an
earth-shattering 10 megahertz is macing
a little bit funny but it's actually a
very good idea gtx 980 cards are
equipped with auto balancing power rails
which take the total power of the card
is allowed to use and instead of having
it a hard split between the core and
memory they allow it to be used as a
pool and allocated to whichever you
prefer the EVGA seems to have recognized
this and has widely focused their power
budget on their core overclock instead
of their memory overclock which improves
performance by a lot more than memory
overclocking itself increasing the base
clock speed from 11:26 to 1291 megahertz
and the boost clock speed from 1216 to
an actually earth-shattering 1393
megahertz but we'll take that even
further later on the IO has been altered
but going from the stock setup of dvi-i
one HDMI and three display ports to DVI
i1 DVID
one HDMI and one DisplayPort this feels
like a strange choice given that g-sync
displays require DisplayPort to enable
g-sync on them and given that display
port can be inexpensively adapted to DVI
I I would have preferred to have left
this as the default config the card is
also slightly longer than the reference
at 11 inches and a lot taller at 5.94
inches compared to the stock card's four
point three six seven inches these size
changes were made to accommodate the
monstrous HDX 2.0 cool
the cooler features dual 100 millimeter
fans with 11 blades each just above the
extremely large heat sink EVGA claims
that it will perform 26% cooler and 36%
quieter than a reference card and our
testing it was able to impressively keep
this card at a relatively cool 68
degrees while overclocked and under
heavy load
we don't have an acoustic chamber yet so
I can't tell you exactly how loud it was
but even when we made it suffer it
wasn't annoying amongst the sleek black
shroud and red accenting we also found a
tastefully illuminated logo that in a
standard configuration at least will
face out of your case but what's that
just above the logo is that a bi house
which does this card support dual BIOS
no it does not it has tripled while
support the three boss modes allow you
to have your TDP change when you change
the boss modes and also change the fan
curve accordingly the three modes are
ln2 mode overclocking mode which is just
a slightly more tame version of ln2 mode
and normal mode for the casuals out
there in the box you'll find a poster a
DVI to VGA adapter - nicely sleeved dual
6 pin - 8 pin adapters a case badge
various EVGA pamphlets and a
non-conductive film just in case you
want to switch to another aftermarket
cooler overclocking was simple enough
with auto balancing power rails I
recommend you only really focus on your
core clock speed just so you know I
cranked voltage and then power limit and
then started fiddling around with the
core I found it went above us I found if
it went above a certain threshold GPU
boost would kick in and throttle the
card back down to exactly 14 50
megahertz as well Oh odd as GPU boost is
usually a little bit more dynamic than
that but regardless after applying a
core clock of plus 110 I found myself
with an all-around overall stable
overclock of 1570 megahertz
behind psewwwww we've been able to
achieve on a gtx 980 of any time so far
after poring over my benchmarking
numbers it was fairly clear that this
was a significant boost over the
reference 980 also please note that
shadow of mordor has an FPS cap of 100
so both the reference 980 and the
classified card were both capped off as
with all of our GPU reviews we're using
our standard test bench the specs for
which you can I
just find on the screen you're looking
at right now and all of the graphics
cards that are used in this test are
overclocked if you want to see my
settings for them you can check the link
in the description down below speaking
of down below what could be lower than
audibles price for a month's membership
you might be able to answer that
question after listening to money master
the game seven simple steps to financial
freedom by Tony Robbins after recently
listening to a TED talk hosted by Tony
Robbins I've been interested in his
works and if you are interested in them
as well you can listen to them while
driving commuting or on public transit
working out doing almost anything as
long as you can have an earbud in if
that sounds interesting to you head over
to audible.com slash Linus and give
their monthly membership a try you get
an audio book with your month and any
audiobooks beyond that one have a fairly
hefty discount so check out audible.com
and I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself
alright guys comment down below what you
thought about this graphics card like
dislike the video subscribe share all
those kind of things if you want to jump
off YouTube jump over to Linus tech tips
comm I'm sure there'll be a forum post
about this which you can probably find
in the description of this video if Nick
did all those things correctly I check
out new office dot Linus tech tips com

campaign is going and click the support
us button in the top right hand corner
of the main website if you want to check
out stuff like our Amazon links to give
us a little bit of a kickback when you
