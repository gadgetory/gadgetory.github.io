may not seem interesting at the outset
this is the Foxconn g-41 SK it is an LGA
775 CPU motherboard and it uses ddr2 ram
so it's got a fairly bog-standard set of
features here is the full specs on the
side so uses a g41 chipset it supports
up to 1333 frontside bus it has four
four PCI Express 16x it has onboard
video it has six channel audio so that's
7.1 Audio Gigabit LAN and SATA tools so
it's called basically everything you
need for a super basic PC and it is tiny
so this is a micro ATX board bear that
in mind a micro ATX board not a mini ITX
board even though it is about the same
size as one and it's got pretty much
everything you need to build a fully
functional IC with just Ram hard drive
well ok you have to actually build a PC
around it but the thing that's
interesting about it is for to me the
size and the price it's super cheap
comes with an i/o shield a SATA cable
and then a molex to SATA power adapter
it comes with some motherboard drivers
and a quick installation guide so a
fairly basic accessory package but
that's what you'd expect from a board in
this sort of price range where really I
haven't seen anything else in literally
years ok so here we've got the LGA 775
socket we've got the power delivery
system around the socket we've got our 4
pin connector and it's almost ideal
location near the top left and then
we've got our 24-pin power in its ideal
location on the far right now you may
have noticed already this is a super
super basic board you've got one one
slot for ddr2 and that supports up to
hopefully 4 gigs alone kind of guessing
here please leave a comment under the
video for our viewers if you find out
how much memory is supported in that one
slot you've got a PCI Express 16x
graphics slot so you can actually
install a full-sized graphics card in
this board if you wanted to a PCIe 1x
slot so you can put sort of one other
expansion card in here to say
DR interfaces and then you've got your
front panel connectors your onboard
speaker header
you've got front panel audio here you've
got hopefully there's a front USB header
somewhere hold on a minute let me figure
this out huh I don't tell there they are
okay there you've got support for up to
four more ports with front panel USB and
you've also got some other pretty useful
stuff like gun IR header here so that
would make this a great little media
board alright so here on the back we
find more media centric features so
you've got digital audio out that's a
pretty good thing to have on such a
value board you've got two ps2 ports one
VGA out so I would recommend adding a
graphics card if you are going to use
this as a media center maybe something
like in a low-end ATI HD 5000 series
like a fifty four fifty that would be a
great choice because with that you can
do all of your decoding on the video
card you can put a low end CPU in here a
little bit of RAM you use your digital
audio and you've got yourself a heck of
a little htpc for super cheap and then
you've got four USB 2.0 ports one
gigabit ethernet and then apparently
that's 7.1 audio somehow but you won't
be able to use a microphone while you're
using those audio ports for 7.1 audio I
hope I said this is a gigabit and thank
you for checking out my simple unboxing
I suppose of the G 41s dash K from box
gone and then the last thing I wanted to
do is just compare it really quickly
against Mini ITX so this is a mini ITX
board you can see the Mini ITX board is
actually only like a centimeter and
change shorter and then in terms of
width the Mini ITX board is exactly the
same width so the only major difference
is the positioning of the mounting holes
so you can see this top left one is the
same okay you can see the one over here
is the same in this corner and then
where we start to run into differences
is here
so the Mini ITX board has one right
under the i/o the i/o
panel and then this other board has
actually no that looks like it's in the
same spot - hold on a minute well there
you go okay so the only reason it's not
mini ITX is because it's not short
enough then there you have it
Foxconn g-41 SK mini ATX motherboard
