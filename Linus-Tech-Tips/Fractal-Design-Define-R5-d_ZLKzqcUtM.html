fractal design that I checked out the
define r2 was that four years ago man
time flies anyway it delivered what was
at the time a great mix of features for
the price and built-in noise damping
which is a really solid value add but
the computer industry moves so fast that
to keep up with their competition
defines r3 and r4 both came very quickly
speaking of coming quickly by the way I
look forward to our Dragon Age awakening
video cards showdown which is coming
very soon make sure you subscribe so you
don't miss it but unlike its
predecessors the define r5 has actually
been in development for over two years
so what the heck have they been doing
all this time the Coolermaster neptune
240m features an exclusive pump design
and their new Silencio fans to provide
impressive near silent performance click
now to learn more well one thing fractal
finally figured out is packing material
experienced companies all eventually
realize that the cost of RMA s and the
bad customer experiences that come with
them is just not worth it yes it's hard
foam but it's thicker and much stronger
than what you'll find protecting many
other cases in this price range thumbs
up on to the chassis itself the outside
really is defined through and through I
mean heck I bet if you lined up ours 1 2
5 in a taste test
only a fractal product designer could
probably actually pick them all
correctly but that doesn't mean that
they haven't changed anything on the top
we get the usual front audio a recessed
reset switch a fancy-looking power
button 2 USB 2 and 2 USB 3.0 ports and
oh what's this then a new coolest top ma
juvett system that allows you to have 0
1 2 or 3 top 120 millimeter or 140
millimeter fan modes from the back while
building I didn't really like the way
they handled the curved corners on the
plastic pieces but looking at it from
the front the way that you'll only see a
computer case it's much less noticeable
aside from the outlines of the pieces
you've left in place the transition
actually looks pretty darn good
probably because fractal did a great job
of matching the plastic and metal
finishes at least on the black and
titanium models I can't speak for the
white one one compromise up here though
that I don't really feel strongly about
either way but feel compelled to point
out is the asymmetrical fan mounts it
doesn't look as clean to have them off
to one side like that but the benefit is
that it gives the motherboard a lot more
room for cooling up at the top on the
front is one of my favorite finishes
faux brushed aluminum normally I prefer
real materials to fake ones but the
brush plastic looks pretty much just
like the real thing is much easier to
clean and in this case keeps light
reflections down making the effect of
the brush this very subtle like this and
also the much easier grieving side vents
that will keep the two front 120
millimeter or 140 millimeter fans
supplied with fresh air the rest of the
front I have kind of mixed feelings
about the bitumen noise dampening inside
the door is good the three fan
controller is good and the much better
and easier to remove front fan filter
are all great additions but while the
idea of reversing the door opening
direction is good the mechanism on our
unit only closes if we kind of swing it
shut rather than closing it nicely and
I'm not a fan of non-standard shaped
five and a quarter inch Bay covers
because if you actually install an
optical drive it looks a little out of
place on it just like it does on course
there's 900 d the r5s bottom has more
good stuff though this front accessible
fan filter slides in and out nice and
easy and protects her insides from
unwanted junk and while there's not much
to say about the side panels the new
left Maju vent looks cleaner than the
old style that exposed the grille when
it wasn't in use IMO and the right panel
now uses captive thumb screws with the
left opting for normal ones a seemingly
strange decision until you realize that
you'll never use them thanks to the new
latching mechanism around the back
there's not much of note you've got your
bottom mounted power supply seven
expansion slots and one
or 140 millimeter fan mounting slots up
at the top riveting let's talk about the
inside shall we speaking of rivets the
inside of the define R 5 is fractals
most modular yet with screws to hold in
the bottom and top hard drive cages
captive ones by the way and even the
optical cage at the top this opens up a
ton of different mounting options for
the up to eight three and a half inch or
two and a half inch drive notes
including rotating the top five ninety
degrees pulling them out entirely
shifting the bottom three left and
bringing the five down hanging eight or
five from the top with the optical cage
remover even just removing all of them
entirely for more cooling space and
which is great because for a silent case
there are a lot of spots to mount fans
and radiators in the front with all
those aforementioned drive cages removed
you can put up to a triple 120 but a
dual 140 looks like kind of a sweet spot
with room for a 120 140 or 120 in the
bottom I'll be it not necessarily at the
same time as the front red or a very
long power supply up to a triple 120 or
140 in the top as long as the total
thickness of the fans and rad doesn't
exceed fifty five millimeters oh and for
good measure you can throw a single 120
or 140 into the back the rest of the
insides from this side are pretty
standard fare the motherboard tray is
only remarkable characteristics other
than the you know usual big CPU cutout
and well positioned cable management
holes where how surprisingly solid it is
even with all the front Bay's that it
anchors to removed and also the way that
the motherboard area sits slightly
recessed something that may cause
clearance issues with those slightly
wider than ATX enthusiast boards if
they're right angle connectors on that
edge are in awkward locations on to the
build process the inclusion of a post in
the center motherboard standoff is
awesome and keeps the mobo in place
while you screw it in the rest of them
but the rest of the standoffs were
pretty lame to install actually
fractally used to include a metal stand
off installation tool and now it's
plastic or nylon or something which
prevents it from sticking to my magnetic
screwdriver and makes it harder to
wrench it in tight enough
but there's more positive stuff to make
up for the
Silver site the SSD mounts on the back
of the motherboard are better than the
older screw through the mobo tray system
I've seen fractal use and as far as
cable management is concerned the define
our floor was cruising for a good - very
good ranking with ample zip-tie loops
lots of room in the right areas behind
the motherboard tray to route cables and
included velcro straps and then I
noticed a couple of things I haven't
personally seen before cable management
loops up the right panel side of the
front awesome and two different
positions for three and a half inch
drive mounting on the metal rails the
standard position and one that brings me
closer to the left side panel for more
room behind them finally the first
define that can not only hold eight
drives but also has enough room for all
the required cables brilliant a huge
improvement over the r2 that I'm using
for my home server right now which I
guess is pretty much the conclusion for
this video isn't it what's the define r5
well it's an improvement over previous
defines in every way it's unlikely to
compel r4 or even r3 owners to upgrade
but at a hundred bucks in change for a
non windowed one like this or ten more
dollars for a windowed version it's a
worthy member of the product family and
are recommended buy from me thanks for
