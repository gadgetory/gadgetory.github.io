fractal design that I checked out the
define our two thank you was that four
years ago man time flies anyway it
delivered what was at the time a great
mix of features for the price and
built-in noise dampening which is a
really solid value add but the computer
industry moves so fast that to keep up
with their competition defines r3 and r4
both came very quickly speaking of
coming quickly by the way I look forward
to our Dragon Age awakening video card
showdown which is coming very soon make
sure you subscribe so you don't miss it
but unlike its predecessors the define R
5 has actually been in development for
over two years so what the heck have
they been doing all this time the
Coolermaster neptune 240m features an
exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more well one thing fractal finally
figured out is packing material
experienced companies all eventually
realize that the cost of RMA s and the
bad customer experiences that come with
them is just not worth it yes it's hard
foam but it's thicker and much stronger
than what you'll find protecting many
other cases in this price range thumbs
up on to the chassis itself the outside
really is defined through and through I
mean heck I bet if you lined up ours one
to five in a taste test only a fractal
product designer could probably actually
pick them all correctly but that doesn't
mean that they haven't changed anything
on the top we get the usual front audio
a recessed reset switch a fancy-looking
power button two USB 2 and two USB 3.0
ports and oh what's this then a new tool
list top mod you vent system that allows
you to have 0 1 2 or 3 top 120
millimeter or 140 millimeter fan modes
from the back while building I didn't
really like the way they handled the
curved corners on the plastic pieces but
looking at it from the front the way
that you'll or mele see a computer case
it's much less noticeable
aside from the outlines of the pieces
you've left in place the transition
actually looks pretty darn good
probably because fractal did a great job
of matching the plastic and metal
finishes at least on the black and
titanium models I can't speak for the
white one one compromise up here though
that I don't really feel strongly about
either way but feel compelled to point
out is the asymmetrical fan mounts it
doesn't look as clean to have them off
to one side like that but the benefit is
that it gives the motherboard a lot more
room for cooling up at the top on the
front is one of my favorite finishes
faux brushed aluminum normally I prefer
real materials to fake ones but the
brush plastic looks pretty much just
like the real thing is much easier to
clean and in this case keeps light
reflections down making the effect of
the brush miss very subtle like this and
also the much easier breathing side
vents that will keep the two front 120
millimeter or 140 millimeter fans
supplied with fresh air the rest of the
front I have kind of mixed feelings
about the bitumen noise dampening inside
the door is good the three fan
controller is good and the much better
and easier to remove front fan filter
are all great additions but while the
idea of reversing the door opening
direction is good the mechanism on our
unit only closes if we kind of swing it
shut rather than closing it nicely and
I'm not a fan of non-standard shaped
five and a quarter inch Bay covers
because if you actually install an
optical drive it looks a little out of
place on it just like it does on course
there's 900 D the R 5 s bottom has more
good stuff though this front accessible
fan filter slides in and out nice and
easy and protects her insides from
unwanted junk and while there's not much
to say about the side panels the new
left Maju vent looks cleaner than the
old style that exposed the grille when
it wasn't in use IMO and the right panel
now uses captive thumb screws with the
left opting for normal ones a seemingly
strange decision until you realize that
you'll never use them thanks to the new
latching mechanism around the back
there's not much of note you've got your
bottom mounted power supply seven
expansion slots and one
or 140 millimeter fan mounting slots up
at the top riveting let's talk about the
inside shall we speaking of rivets the
inside of the define R 5 is fractals
most modular yet with screws to hold in
the bottom and top hard drive cages
captive ones by the way and even the
optical cage at the top this opens up a
ton of different mounting options for
the up to eight three and a half inch or
two and a half inch drive mounts
including rotating the top five ninety
degrees pulling them out entirely
shifting the bottom three left and
bringing the five down hanging eight or
five from the top with the optical cage
removed or even just removing all of
them entirely for more cooling space and
which is great because for a silent case
there are a lot of spots to mount fans
and radiators in the front with all the
aforementioned drive cages removed you
can put up to a triple 120 but a dual
140 looks like kind of a sweet spot with
room for a 120 140 or blue 120 in the
bottom I'll be at the same time as the
front red or a very long power supply up
to a triple 120 or 140 in the top as
long as the total thickness of the fans
and red doesn't exceed 55 millimeters oh
and for good measure you can throw a
single 120 or 140 into the back the rest
of the insides from this side are pretty
standard fare the motherboard tray is
only remarkable characteristics other
than the you know usual big CPU cutout
and well positioned cable management
holes where how surprisingly solid it is
even with all the front bays that it
anchors to removed and also the way that
the motherboard area sits slightly
recessed something that may cause
clearance issues with those slightly
wider than ATX enthusiast boards if
their right angle connectors on that
edge
are in awkward locations on to the build
process the inclusion of a post in the
center motherboard standoff is awesome
and keeps the mobo in place while you
screw it in the rest of them but the
rest of the standoffs were pretty lame
to install actually fractally used to
include a metal stand off installation
tool and now it's plastic or nylon or
something which prevents it from
sticking to my magnetic screwdriver and
makes it harder to wrench it in tight
enough
but there's more positive stuff to make
up for the
oversite the SSD mounts on the back of
the motherboard are better than the
older screw through the mobo tray system
I've seen fractal use and as far as
cable management is concerned the define
r4 was cruising for a good - very good
ranking with ample zip-tie loops lots of
room in the right areas behind the
motherboard tray to route cables and
included velcro straps and then I
noticed a couple things I haven't
personally seen before cable management
loops up the right panel side of the
front awesome and two different
positions for three and a half inch
drive mounting on the metal rails the
standard position and one that brings me
closer to the left side panel for more
room behind them finally the first
define that can not only hold eight
drives but also has enough room for all
the required cables brilliant a huge
improvement over the r2 that I'm using
for my home server right now which I
guess is pretty much the conclusion for
this video isn't it what's the define r5
well it's an improvement over previous
defines in every way it's unlikely to
compel r4 or even r3 owners to upgrade
but at a hundred bucks in change for a
non windowed one like this or ten more
dollars for a windowed version it's a
worthy member of the product family and
are recommended buy from me thanks for
