like 2011 and for some pretty good
reasons Ashley but we'll get into that
later looking back at the last physics
video we released we noticed quite the
demand in the comment section for a
modern follow-up so we'll do that and
try a bunch of different scenarios and
add some more information to the pool
intel skull Canyon Nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the
link in the video description so a few
different questions will be raised and
hopefully answered in this video we're
going to look at the full range of
current 1000 series Nvidia Pascal GPUs
and how they perform while running
alongside a physics focused lower end
GPU we're going to try to find what is
the best bang for your buck in if you're
shopping for a PhysX card and we're
going to try to figure out roughly if
it's worth it to add your old card to
your new system as a physics GPU or if
you should just sell it then last but
not least well I'll just have some fun
with some ludicrous setups like 1080
with the 1080 physics card and that's
insane so why not
in order to test all of these scenarios
we needed some games are chosen games
where Assassin's Creed Black Flag Metro
last light fallout 4 in Batman Arkham
Knight one of the most controversial
releases of recent years so right away
with Assassin's Creed Black Flag and
fallout 4 it just seems that having a
physics card really doesn't do anything
but Metro last light does show
relatively minor increases across the
board and that boom holy benchmarks
Batman out of nowhere like a thug in a
dark alley maybe too soon it's been a
while
the Batman benchmarks did show
significant improvements with a
dedicated PhysX card and yeah let's dive
deeper we'll start with a gtx 1060 we
first paired it with the GT 730 now the
GT 730 is a really card if you're
wondering why check out this video when
paired with this shitty card lost 5
frames per second on average ruff we're
moving up to the Sun 50 Ti however we
saw an overall improvement of about 2.5
FPS not a huge gain but it's something
to work with stepping up a little bit to
the 1070 we saw a similar story but two
more extremes with the 1030 as a physics
card we saw a loss of 11 FPS than with
the 750 we saw a gain of 5 FPS so cool
again when looking at the 1080 we saw
extremes paired with the 730 at
dropped almost 16 FPS the Sun 50 it
gained just over 5 FPS and going up from
there we seemed to max out at a gain of
about 6 to 7 even when the dedicated
card was just another 1080 which is
crazy whoa okay so one of the cool
things here is all of the particle
effects that are just everywhere the
smoke the little sparks there's a bunch
of different stuff in this scene and
that's why this game benefits so much
from physics but as you can see right
now it's choppy it doesn't feel very
good and that's because we're running
with the GTX 730 if you check out in the
bottom corner here you can see the
utilization of both GPUs the 730 is
doing a lot of work but the 1080 is
barely working at all the 1080 is GPU
one the 7:30 is GPU 2 now with the 750
Ti you can see it's much more smooth the
particle effects are all running fine
it's not choppy anymore all that kind of
good stuff and again we come down to the
corner you can see that the utilization
of the first card is not being hampered
at all it's able to go full-bore all the
time which is why everything's much more
smooth the physics card is able to
operate on its own and do everything it
needs to while not hampering
the actual normal GPU and with that the
sales of gtx 750ti is in 760 s go
through the freaking roof nvidia mails
us a check for 1 billion dollars we buy
12 new office buildings each for one of
Linus's Lambos and troll away into the
night not so fast little Lambo - not so
fast there are like an embarrassingly
low amount of games that support physics
and not that many come here on the
corner that will either a hard sell for
someone that could just flip their old
graphics card for more lunch money or
avoid buying a physics card altogether
so in the end the answer is it's just
not worth it unless you really really
like Batman games or for some other very
intensely physics title and there really
aren't many of them so good luck if you
like this video like it and get
subscribed if you dislike this video and
you're like dude don't make a thug's in
an alley joke
and that's just rude dislike it if you
want a shirt or any of the things that
you saw us use like graphics cards in
this video you can show links of your
description below including Amazon you
want to see another video that we've
released check out this one on why SLI
is crazy right now like what the hell is
going on with SLI because it's nuts
