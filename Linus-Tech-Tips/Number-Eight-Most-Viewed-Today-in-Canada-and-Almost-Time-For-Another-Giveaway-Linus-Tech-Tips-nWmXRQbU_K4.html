checking out youtube because that's what
people who are on youtube do I think as
far as I know and anyway I was I was
checking the status of my subscribers
because I'm supposed to give away an
antec Quattro 1200 watt OC edition power
supply as soon as they hit 10,000 so the
first thing I noticed is that we're
really close okay so you can see that my
subscribers have now reached do to do to
do if this little thing would work
properly there we go 9995 so only five
subscribers to go until I give away the
Quattro 1200 watt power supply but while
I was here I also noticed and I'm going
to be bragging a little bit here because
here we go i checked the awards for
today linus tech tips is number eight
most viewed today in canada so this is
my first time breaking the top ten so
right there number eight today with
23,000 278 views and that pretty much
made my night so that's something else
that we can celebrate when we give away
the quattro 1200 watt power supply
thanks to all my subscribers and all of
my viewers for your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
