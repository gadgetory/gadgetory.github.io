start with this one today so you
probably saw our last sponsored video
from Lenovo on the yoga book if you
didn't it's right around there but uh
here we go
okay so let's clear some space
where's our core you're out MacBook Pro
you're out money cat money cats it's so
fab - Pro what is this thing it's a
phone it's a tablet it's a phablet it's
right in the name so it's got a
Snapdragon processor a static cling
screen cover thingamabob err it's got 64
gigs of storage it's got AC Wi-Fi it's
got a 4050 milliamp hour battery it's
got a massive 1440 screen and hope look
at that would you look at that
now would you look at that headphone
jack right but moving around to the back
this is where we get into the really
interesting stuff so right here is a 16
megapixel camera 60 megapixels RGV which
basically just means it's the camera but
no no there's other stuff so this guy
right here is a depth camera this is a
flash so the flash is normal - these are
the normal parts then there's a fisheye
camera and a fingerprint okay a lot of
phones have those too okay so every
other thing back here is unusual let's
go ahead and get this baby fired up wow
that is a really fast fingerprint sensor
it is actually registering them that
fast discover tango an introduction to
the tango experience
tango I'm not being allowed display so I
can't tell oh crap
IPS oh wow those are really deep blacks
whoa check this out
so the idea is that it uses a
combination of the sensors and cameras
to figure out spatially WIPP why is
there like a goat or something in my
office it's not a deer well I don't know
what it is okay now I'm really confused
these are like wolf deer raccoon things
Wow look at him now they stopped what a
loser loser wrong oh well that's like a
window into the like real world again
oh and we're back to the real world okay
so back to the cameras again why do they
need all these cameras and sensors for
Google tango well they need sensors that
are capable of motion tracking so this
is obviously to help the device
understand its orientation and physical
space they need multiple cameras that
allow tango to recognize the world
around the device by utilizing visual
cues this helps to self correct for
errors in the motion tracking and it
needs the depth sensor that allows tango
enabled devices right now this is the
only one of course to understand the
shape of the world around us that way
you can interact with the world around
you in all new ways
utilizing the virtual world created by
tango so now that we've got that all
sorted out let's go try it shall we so
the idea is that you trash the castle
okay yeah
fantastic now what happens that's it I
only get one shot I mean that's okay I
got three stars I guess but I'm gonna go
see it turn that out that's what you
can't do in Angry Birds getting close
and inspect the havoc you've caused oh
my goodness there's so many dead people
in that castle you just can't see it
because you don't have the angle for it
but trust me there's lots of dead people
and you know it's actually a savage
savagely realistic game size matters
bigger pieces are harder to knock over
than smaller ones and too close to damn
Island nutria close to me okay this time
I'm going to strategically attack that
spot right there but I'm going to pull
back harder because I think that was my
problem last night oh I'm sitting in the
garbage can this is fine everything
about what's going on right now is fine
what hey where'd you go oh oh oh there
he goes can I pet it I actually don't
know well yes I think so
oh well there we go oh yeah we got a
huge dog hide puppy his eyes are so
soulless empty
ah he's coming for ya okay so new idea
let's go on the green screen and try the
Dinos among us an experiment in
augmented reality from the American
Museum of national history national
natural
that's not a Dino that's a penguin can
you stop poking me with the camera geez
okay Velociraptor oh that's not nearly
as big as I thought it would be no no no
that's what like real Raptors are like
they're like Turkey's really yeah so
they're not like Jurassic party help me
there is a dinosaur like that but it
wasn't the Velociraptor interesting you
know I've heard about this this whole
thing where like there's speculation
that dinosaurs were much more closely
related to birds and probably had
feathers versus being like reptiles with
scaly skin like we thought they were
when we were kids mind you when I was a
kid we thought brontosaurus was a thing
so that's how out of touch my generation
is okay do something oh can I make it
bigger Velociraptor was a fierce
predator probably had large wings
interesting
that's really cool just going to put all
the dinosaurs around now we're just
going to have an office full of
dinosaurs oh that's cool it still
remembers where I put Velociraptor here
let's place our last one oh wow that
one's big hey bud see so there's our
credit tricks our Archaeopteryx and are
philosoraptor and our our NASA - hey oh
you can sit down guys mmhmm yeah yeah
that's it
so let's try a game - sure a lot less
work than $10 nice day
I don't how many dominoes you can drive
how fast can you go
okay step back oh that's not what I
meant to you oh no they're gonna hit
each other we're gonna have a domino
collision Oh hail that's pretty cool
though actually
so tango then no I've seen this kind of
tech before I've seen like take a
picture and have dinosaurs appear in it
or whatever the case may be but it's
pretty clear that thanks to the
additional hardware the whole thing does
work better on this now with that said
everything you guys saw today was either
obviously pretty early stages or clearly
labeled as an experimental project so
what I want to know from you then is
what do you see in terms of the
potential future for this let us know in
the comments below we will be reading
them so thanks again then to Lenovo for
sponsoring this video and for sending us
the fab tube pro if all this augmented
reality looks pretty cool to you you can
actually get one of your own we'll have
that linked in the video description and
I think that pretty much wraps it up
thanks again for watching guys don't
forget to subscribe and all that good
stuff I will see you again next time but
maybe an augmented reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
