unboxing this is the aqua rider 703
tugboat and I know I said I know I said
that the excavator was the last Arctic
hobby RC vehicle that I was going to
take a look at but the awful rider
beckons and I had to heat it siren call
oh my goodness this thing is hilarious
yes that is the color scheme it is red
black green yellow blue brown and silver
so give me a second Oh actually hold on
we can see the accessories that are
included up here no give me a second to
get these to get these opened up and
then we'll have a look at it so we're
doing a bit of an in-progress shot here
we've got all these tires which go
around the outside of the boat so you
can see there's lots and lots of tires
we also found the battery compartment so
here's where the receiver is connected
to channels 1 &amp;amp; 2 and then we've also
got a receiver crystal that matches the
transmitter crystal that was included so
that means we can use an aftermarket
transmitter with this particular boat
here we've also got the power lead for
the battery the battery pack the rope
for tying up the tires a rope for
presumably towing things and then we've
got a little hook here that seems to be
fairly securely attached and it is like
you know a tugboat so my assumption is
that you can actually type something
with it what else have we got going on
here I'm working on trying to get the
antenna through the tube here and we're
going to try and figure out where the
where this is actually going to go
because once we put this back on you can
see there actually aren't any holes for
us to to thread this through so that's
our in progress so give us a little
while here guys and we'll get this all
set up so that took forever
Arctic cooling includes a lot of extra
time
my guess is that for the tugboat
enthusiast they might want to take these
tires and put them around like the the
barge that they attach to their tugboat
so we haven't really taken a close look
at it yet but I'll show you guys here's
the antenna here's the mounting point
for it okay so here's it coming out the
top we showed you the interior this is
really cool check out the drydock that
it comes with so it's got little rubber
grippy things here and the name the
South Hampton and then it fits on pretty
nicely so you can you know keep it nice
and solid while you're working on it and
you know doing whatever it is tugboat
enthusiasts do this seals off all of the
electrical components from the places
where they hold on slicks indicating
something to me I yes excellent
so this seals off all the electrical
stuff from where water might get at it
hopefully it seals it well there is a
like a neoprene seal around there okay
so this guy goes in here so we're
putting the tugboat back together at
this point now that we have hold on
apparently I'm doing something wrong
again okay yeah something about
something about rope all the wires on
the way now there we go good works like
okay that's why we pay him the big bucks
yeah I know right okay so uh that's
reattached our extra tires are deposited
gracefully on the deck and so here's our
included battery and we are ready to go
with the Southampton now something to
bear in mind guys is this one does not
come with a remote so you have to get a
transmitter and then you're going to use
this crystal in order to pair the
transmitter to the tugboat itself so
we'll be unboxing that one and then
trying this guy out hopefully on a lake
or a pond or bathtub near you so one
more kind of close look so you can see
there's like little steering wheel or
whatever it's called in a boat
the steering wheel is called it a boat
lots of like little you know cute little
ladders and stuff like that and pretty
robust looking propeller system going on
down here
so hopefully this guy can actually you
know haul itself and something else at a
reasonable speed so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the AR 703
