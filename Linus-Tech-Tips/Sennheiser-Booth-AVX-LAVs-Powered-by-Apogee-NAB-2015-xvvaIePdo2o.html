kick off our coverage we're here at the
Sennheiser booth check out all of their
new gear let's get into it Linus tech
tips coverage of NAB 2015 is powered by
Sennheiser Kingston and Linda calm so
the moment I got into the Sennheiser
group i was told that they had a new
audio product that as a video guy would
really impress me so i went into it not
really knowing what to expect they
handed me this new Sennheiser AVX now if
this looks really simple that is by
design as I mentioned in our gear video
we've been using Sennheiser g3s for a
long time but the idea behind this
device is to make wireless audio a very
simple and quick process especially if
you're on a tight timeline you simply
plug it into a camera or audio recorders
XLR port and the receiver powers on and
pears to the pre pared microphone this
really speeds up any audio setup you'll
have to do with a hammer or lav mic
wirelessly if you have ever had to shoot
video as a one-man band like I have in
the past you will appreciate how simple
this AVX is to use sennheiser has
targeted this product to people who do a
lot of video work but can't afford to
have audio take a big chunk of their
setup time and for show coverage like we
do I see this being a very handy tool to
have moving onto sennheiser's new MKE to
digital and clip mike digital these are
to iOS specific lab monks that
Sennheiser has made in partnership with
apogee physically each mike has a
built-in preamp designed by apogee to
give clean quality audio straight into
your iPhone or iPad both mics feature a
lightning connector at the bottom for
easy input into an iPhone 5 or later and
most current iPads the mics come
included with a clip to rig the mic to a
shirt or jacket and are easy to use with
sennheisers ios app that works in tandem
with either one of these new lab mics I
see this mic being great for journalists
on the go who wants to record interviews
while only needing to bring around their
iphone or ipad or even simply to use as
a quality mic source on a conference
call the MKE to is intended for slightly
more professional applications like
documentary interviews and live events
where the clip mike digital is intended
for anyone who wants a quality audio
solution without buying any
our equipment to get it the last thing
that really caught my eye at the booth
was sennheiser's finalized version of
their s Ferris around microphone system
at the heart of the system you have the
spm 8000 stereo microphone connected
into their SBP 8000 unit with this
interesting double analogue XLR cable
what this all adds up to is a stereo
microphone setup that really brings you
into the atmosphere of wherever the mic
is placed in trying it out myself I see
this being great for sports events that
I really want you to feel like you're
sitting right in the arena with everyone
