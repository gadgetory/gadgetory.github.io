if you guys watch this channel chances
are you've got a fond memory of a
ThinkPad whether you were trying to get
need for speed to se to run on your
parents work laptop or you were actually
doing important things for yourself the
ThinkPad was always up to the task with
its rugged design and nipple for mouse
but are those just rosy eyed memories or
were these actually fantastic machines
that would still hold up today
well the 25th anniversary edition is
here and it might be everything I
remember and more speaking of
remembering remember to check out
Sennheiser's PXE 550 wireless headphones
they feature up to 30 hours of battery
life
noise guard hybrid active noise
cancellation and more you can learn more
at the link below
rising out of its box the ThinkPad
anniversary edition is soaked in
nostalgia everything about it just feels
right
the keyboard the track nub and even the
way it beeps at you when you press too
many keys at once the outer build
quality feels exceptional dare I say
even up to the old IBM standard and
every surface is sturdy while also
surprisingly smooth Iowa is the modern
minimalistic trend is nowhere to be seen
it's got Ethernet HDMI 3 USB 3 ports an
SD reader and Thunderbolt 3 so you won't
be left stranded no matter what you need
while you're working just like an old
thing pad on that subject let's meet the
og device that we'll be comparing it to
we took a trip down to the local
electronics recycler free geek Vancouver
and picked up this sweet ThinkPad 560 X
a model from before IBM had stopped
making laptops and sold that business
unit and its trademarks to Lenovo at 20
years old this thing well before we
would even think about using it it
needed a really good scrub but after
some love from a mover moving tool a new
CMOS battery Wow look at that
duck cursor man and some old-school
Windows know-how from Anthony it was
ready to go so let's look at the specs
of both computers the ThinkPad
anniversary rocks a solid the last gen
core i7 7500 u dual-core CPU which is so
much faster than the pentium MMX
Tillamook in the 560 X that there is no
meaningful way to compare the two
it's got 170 times more memory with 128
times the storage and the only real
disappointment here is probably the GPU
10 series graphics cards have been out
for about a year and a half now and the
GT 940 in here is better than nothing
but it won't handle anything but older
game
and maybe a bit of acceleration in
Photoshop or premiere to its credit
though the anniversary edition kept all
of its components nice and cool while
remaining quiet although it can air
sometimes on the side of lower clocks
for longer battery life and lower
temperatures rather than higher clocks
with more heat and more power the
keyboards on both feel almost identical
save for the very soft semicolon on the
560 X and that's a good thing since they
both have amazing keyboards the keys
have a super long travel with this great
tactile feedback and the layout that
might be a bit strange these days might
be wrong it's morning
jieb oh shut the fuck up like it would
be easy to accidentally hit function s
instead of actually saving your work for
example but it's nothing you couldn't
get used to and pretty much every G you
could need is present I give it an A as
for the trackpad to its credit it tracks
well and is surprisingly smooth to the
touch but it is pretty small since most
of the vertical space here is taken out
by the left right and middle clicks for
the red pointing stick between the G H
and B keys let's talk about that with
how god-awful the track pads were 20
years ago it is no great mystery by
people who actually had time sensitive
work to do
prefered these little nubbins but these
days not everyone is going to like a
track point even with the four nipple
options included in the box and it does
take a little getting used to but we
would never take points off for
including it because for us the
anniversary edition ended up being all
about options for certain tasks like
highlighting text or quickly switching
between mousing and typing the track
point was as the kids say on point for
casual one-handed operation while
sitting back the touchpad was generally
preferred and for bigger movements the
included touchscreen was a definite
blessing though I wish I could say the
same about other aspects of the screen
the balls Lenovo where is my dedicated
brightness adjustment slider this
experience has been totally ruined for
me ruined
yeah I'm just kidding the 1080p IPS
display with a matte finish isn't
cutting edge but it's still great for
productivity and is definitely better
than the 560 X's 800 by 600 HP a display
that has pixel response times in the
hundreds of milliseconds it really is
too bad that it's old owner didn't
spring for the TN panel for so the
ThinkPad 25th anniversary edition also
includes lots of options when it comes
to authentication with Windows hello
added to it's perfectly acceptable
webcam and speakers and a fingerprint
reader to the right of the keyboard then
once it's unlocked
assuming that you went for the option
with a second hot swappable battery this
thing will keep going almost all day now
unsurprisingly the ThinkPad anniversary
edition isn't the premier multimedia
laptop on the market no high resolution
display no amazing speakers with Dolby
Atmos certification and it sucks for
games but it is easily one of the best
laptops for productivity and in many
ways it makes other devices these days
feel like decorations or toys with its
excellent keyboard pointing stick and
battery life now I don't know if it'll
still be working 20 years from now like
our 5 60 X but I also don't see why it
would let you down it's everything we
like about modern notebooks with
everything we remember liking about
classic ones so if you were thinking
about pulling the trigger I say go for
it as long as you can afford one or even
get one since it's a limited production
run this episode was brought to you by
tunnel bear be easy to use VPN app when
people are shopping for a VPN one of the
features they look for is a kill switch
so before you connect to a network your
device starts to send information about
itself and what it wants to do and it
tries to establish connections with all
sorts of things and there are other
devices out
that are trying to connect to yours well
a kill switch stops all of this from
happening because before you connect to
your VPN all your traffic is unencrypted
so in the few seconds it takes to
connect you've probably already
broadcast your IP a few DNS requests or
a search query
well vigilant bear from tunnel bear
stops all of this behavior from
happening by blocking all outbound and
inbound traffic so nothing leaks out
before you're connected
this keeps you private throughout your
entire connection time and it even kicks
back in if your connection goes down for
some reason and you have to reconnect so
