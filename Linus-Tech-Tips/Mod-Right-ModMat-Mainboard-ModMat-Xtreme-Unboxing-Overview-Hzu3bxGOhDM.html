Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
Haswell system for unbelievable overall
performance welcome to a dual unboxing
of a couple of different products I've
got the mod matte mainboard and the mod
matte extreme which are both from mod
right
these are PC building gears so to speak
and what they are designed to be is a
static safe workstation covering that is
portable is scratch resistant so it's
not going to damage you know your side
panel window or high-gloss finish on
your graphics card or anything like that
as well as provide you with some useful
information that you might need to
reference while you're in the building
process inside the box you find not only
the mod matte so there's the mod matte
mainboard and here's the mod matte
extreme but also an anti-static wrist
strap and an anti-static alligator clip
so let's get the unwrapping process
documented here it comes with a plastic
over layer with a paper under layer and
then finally there we have it
ah the mod mat itself so this is the
motherboard version or mainboard version
which hat is smaller but still has many
of the same advantages that is to say
that it's anti-static so check this out
so the idea is you take this and you
ground out your mod mat to something you
know such as I plugged in but not
powered on power supply or something in
a ground outlet in your wall or whatever
else the case may be that makes sure
that this is completely anti-static and
then now that we've got it spread out we
can see where those two pieces clip on
to so you can tie your anti-static wrist
strap here and then you can ground out
the mod mat itself by using the allele
eight Allenwood
alligator clip to plug into whether it's
you know a ground outlet on your wall
outlet or something like a power I
plugged in but not powered on power
supply or whatever else the case may be
here this is cool so check this out
I've got a motherboard handy which is
why I have a motherboard here so this
right here is to show you what size your
motherboard is if you weren't sure
so ATX is gonna be presumably I don't
know presumably it goes here yes so that
is an ATX board so you can see that an e
ATX board would go all the way to here
and hptx board so things like the SRX
from EVGA would go all the way to here
so if you were ever not quite sure you'd
be able to quickly check and reference
what size your board is so there's
another convenient measurement here that
tells you pretty much the same thing if
you have any confusion about the ports
on your motherboard you can also check
this handy dandy reference chart here
which tells you pretty much what all of
this stuff is so there you go that
matches up to that so the mainboard one
isn't the one that has sort of the more
advanced features and charts and graphs
that is saved for the extreme model now
we have the mod matte extreme spread out
in front of us and you can see but
there's an awful lot of room to work you
can have a motherboard here your case
here all your random accessories spread
out and it has a lot of weh-weh super
more useful stuff on it so for example
you can quickly and easily find out what
size of radiator is and check the
spacing so there I can see okay Dada
Dada Dada there you go
that is a dual 120 millimeter radiator
and then you've got your 140 s on the
side it measures everything up to a
quadrat very cool stuff you can quickly
and easily I mean okay so some of the
stuff won't be useful to someone like me
I know what how big a radiator is just
looking at it so you've got other things
that again wouldn't be that useful to me
because I know how big a three and a
half inch hard drive is versus a two and
a half inch hard drive so you can see I
mean it makes for just cool schematics
on it if nothing else but this is a cool
one being able to quickly reference how
big a fan is so there you go you got
marks on here that show you this is a
140 millimeter if you line it up there
and it lines up with all the other ones
you got a 140 mm fan on your hands if it
lines up here and goes to all these
other ones you've got a 120 ml fan on
your hands not everyone can identify
fans just looking at them with
for reference so that's really nice to
have next up we've got tubing sizes so
this allows you to take a piece of
tubing and basically go yeah there
that's five eighths inch OD that is 3/8
cents ID which means that it there that
one see I had it on the wrong one and
you could tell it wasn't quite lining up
so you can see from how big the hole is
and how thick the wall is that is the
size that is you can make sure it's
compatible with your compressions and
you can see they've got a little chart
here for that as well now this is the
one that I really like this is the kind
of thing that I would actually have to
reference on an ongoing basis and that
is wiring diagrams if you do any cable
sleeving or anything like that
these could save your life because they
tell you exactly what the voltages are
of all the pins they give you all the
color coding and so if you do any custom
wiring on your own that could actually
be maybe not a lifesaver but definitely
a component saver because you might not
break something that you otherwise would
have broken for your reference they also
show you all the latest sockets from
Intel and AMD and little diagram so you
can make sure you don't screw up
anything on that side so you can see
quite clearly that this one right here
is dentin on uh LGA 1155 or 1156
actually it's LGA 1150 but they had no
way of knowing that when they
manufactured this thing in all
likelihood so it's a grippy anti-static
workplace has some cool little
references looks really good and the
Xtreme has more mounting points for your
anti-static wrist strap as well as your
grounding strap so there's one over here
on the far right and then there's one
over here up by the top thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the mod mat main board and the mod
mat extreme don't forget to subscribe to
