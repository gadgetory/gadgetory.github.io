note there's no way they remove them
there's no I would not risk it
I doubt it either way I just I just have
to get my super professional thank you
say there we go oh yeah RTX on I don't
want to stand up in Lake show everyone
how that Twitter's Twitter hates this
shirt oh yeah they're like why would I
buy that and I I heard through the
grapevine that some people at Nvidia
have seen it already yeah and they're
like so is he saying that like RTX makes
him hard or that like r-tx can suck it
and it's just like that's not even the
meme it's when you've got a big rate of
trace need rate raised bright yeah I
mean it's a lie but oh this week that's
been a good week as long as you're not
Nvidia hoping to keep our TX 2000 mine
does well ha what could I say
oh part way through I was like why is he
stuttering on this and then I realized
that good maybe there's so there's a
good chance okay that reviews of the
r-tx graphics cards when they could come
because we know who everyone has them
right because I'm unboxings went up
today yeah so so I could extrapolate
from that that probably reviews are
coming at some point do we have one yes
okay we did an unboxing today of a
network switch and my new router with
our TX boxes in the background nice okay
pure lols
that's pure lols that's great so people
like the comments are full of like I
thought it would be the iPhone 10s I
thought it would be our chance nope
neither that's what I wanted to do so so
so okay so we know everyone has cards
and we we know that usually reviews come
you know I don't know a week or so after
unboxing
start to go up generally a week or two
um especially when they embargo
everything what we don't know is what if
anything with our TX in it could
possibly be included in a review in that
timeframe no no these are all things
that
okay so there's okay well we'll get into
it more later but I'm just I'm just
saying gear up for disappointment I mean
there's one good game in that list it's
not about good games or bad games it's
about having it the rest having it you
have this which one he'll bleed cinemas
sacrifice okay but is the feature
enabled because we also have shadow of
the Tomb Raider mm which doesn't have
the patch yeah I'm Pub G okay
look how pub G is under the rest okay
newly added in there okay all right all
right
anyway anyway topics for this week
NVIDIA has revealed some performance of
the RT X series but like one question
one question yeah I tried RT ice no you
know what save that for after the intro
because I don't want people you know
leaving the video yet okay cuz that's
like as soon as people see that's the
title of the videos it's something about
our TX performance as soon as people get
that they're just gonna leave okay gonna
leave of us and we're gonna be sad that
would make me sad um actually I just I
just you know what screw it we'll talk
about it now but you have to watch the
intro first
No
our yard uh-oh I'm in trouble now Oh
Colton's gonna yell at me you know he
has gotten pretty big for his britches
he like gets mad at me when I do stuff
wrong now remember how timid he was yes
like I would if you told me back then
that he would eventually do that part of
me would be like it's cold and I could
see it but at the same time no no he was
like Oh
apparently the intro volume is bummed up
for some reason I have no idea why that
is but I blame Jake yeah me too
anyway the quote when he first started
I'd be like hey Colton would you mind
maybe please doing something be like oh
okay I'm sorry
whereas now he's like yeah you done you
done screwed that up right don't worry
I'll fix it you know he's like he's all
like business√≠
it's crazy right yeah he's gonna give me
crap if I if I save the sponsors name
room anyway um why don't we jump right
in to tell me so you were you were at I
guess was it oh my good it's September
you were at Paxton house it passed so
you tried our TX yes there was an all
right there's an so how much of your
life okay would you want to look back on
and not have had RTX in it yeah I don't
I don't I understand this is the meme
but I don't I don't remember exactly how
Steve replied to the meme so I can't do
like the proper meme response yeah but
yeah I know it was I mean it was cool I
had some some bigger and other takeaways
though I asked I was very specific but
what I was able to talk about from the
invite-only event okay and I'm not
allowed to say what game it was and I
can't say whether or not it's on the
list of games that we have here but I
can talk about the experience I just
can't talk about what game it was I
I think the reason for that was actually
no I don't even want to go into that
allude to what game it was but yeah I
can talk about how good it was there
about they are very cagey but I was able
yeah I was able to use frame rates on
demos I have an interesting idea as to
why that might be okay all right I'll
get into that next then looks like this
is gonna be the r-tx show so are we
going into another topic Emma no no okay
yet me so they had a cool feature where
you can just tap I think it was f1 yeah
and it would rapidly switch between r-tx
on and r-tx off sure like there was like
no lag no switching between it at all
and there was no framerate difference
and I think that was the reason why they
limited was because they didn't want to
show you the difference even if there
was a very minor difference in
performance if there was some amount it
would skew the conversation away from
what r-tx looked like and they wanted
the conversation be about what it looked
like
sure now the second part was how good
did it look yes I can't tell you what
game it was which would be super helpful
for explaining how good it looked but
I'll give you the vague definitely not
enough information it looked very good
which is useless cuz you don't know what
game you know what and I can't tell you
what I want Riley back on the land show
instead
Riley back he's gonna review the r-tx
20s aw that was good that was nuts
people freaked out way too hardcore I
watched it and was like I don't
understand what people have said Riley
watched it and was like I don't
understand so the thing is that people
were like - you made a joke and it
didn't land but I think what they're
missing is that Riley was the one who
made the joke and it was an inside joke
to me yeah and I made an inside joke
back to him and it was fun
and we don't we didn't really matter if
it landed with you guys not everything
on the land show is necessarily about
okay like it is it's obviously it's a
show it's right in there it's show but
but some to keep some banter going some
insights
is gonna be said because you're just in
the flow of things okay here's the big
narrator though RTX off looked horrible
and I can't tell you are we back to the
whole stupid HDR on-and-off-again thing
again like know that this is where okay
so my fury is like the games looked
intentionally destroyed with a 2cr off
this is where I think it's different
this is all theorycrafting I couldn't
get any answers out of them obviously
but yeah pitch that happened before yeah
we saw the game a big part that they
brought up was that enabling artsy acts
putting RDX into your game is super easy
this is really important it takes very
little time it takes very little work
okay so basically where it's going
whatever game this is has just garbage
town lighting because that's hard and it
has good lighting with our TX because
our TX is easy because that what my say
so it looks like part of the prom is
killing me here
I can't say what game it was yeah but
either people that have wood maybe maybe
I will say that something along the
lines of that game that has existed in
the past
whether it was a previous version or it
was the same development house or it was
something I don't know I can't get too
specific the lighting was really good
okay like notably really good okay and
it looked like trash so so I think the
thing that's happening is yeah I don't
know this is all super unconfirmed here
the thing that's happening is it's
really easy to turn our TX on you can
save development dollars by just
throwing our TX on your game then it'll
look really good you can get great
screenshots and get great demos some
people will have a great experience in
the game there's turn our TX on and then
for all of the plebs who maybe you know
you just don't care about or whatever
like they can just have a garbage
experience
yeah and I'm hoping that whatever game
it was and I think this is why I'm not
allowed to say it is because they're
probably going to work on their r-tx off
okay but I think in video on to show it
before they had worked on their r-tx off
of course so I think the r-tx off will
get better because they'll work on it
but it revealed this potential scenario
where they just plug RTX into the game
and they're like well that's enough you
know what it seems like to me this whole
thing is just not ready you know needs
being rushed yeah I really really liked
the idea of the tech like yeah hardware
not yeah ray-tracing necessarily but
having the I cores
you know to move things on to the a
cores because with having a sync on your
CUDA cores yeah having like physical
async with being able to move things to
the other cores like be able to pull
anti-aliasing and putting it on one of
the AI chord and stuff that's super cool
I really really like that stuff I don't
know so part of my idea is I think
they're trying to add something a little
bit less tangible to the difference
between Nvidia cards and AMD cards you
mean more more tangible or something
less meditatively yeah yeah yeah so like
an FPS number and a dollar number are
very we used to I'm sure we still do
make dollar per performance graphs for
everything all the time because it's a
really good measure that's what they've
been trying to do that for years with GF
experience which by the way I don't
think was unintentional GeForce
experience GF experience yeah I know
right
okay I mean they also called a TV yeah
BFG display yeah yeah I mean these guys
man um anyway anyway anyway the point is
they've been trying to differentiate
themselves through features and
experience which are years now I don't
blame them which which I don't blame
them for at all yeah but and for a long
time to be honest I think they kind of
had it and then I think they pissed a
lot of people off with the GeForce
experience stuff yeah they've helped it
a lot I'm gonna keep giving them credit
for this but ya know there's it's way
more install I appreciate that that is
that is way way way better I don't know
afk Jim 4:20 so as I see the new
architecture will make the RT X cards by
for longer as they age being able to
offload some of the work to other course
okay
the issue with that is that unless
nvidia absolutely nailed it like this is
the first attempt and i don't think i've
ever seen that happen before where
whether it's beefing up the GPU fully
whenever it's that then the next the
next-gen GPU tech whether it's
tessellation or whether it's a new
shader model or whatever the case may be
whenever there's some new piece of tech
that lands the first implementation in
hardware always kind of misses something
and it's the tweaked one that goes oh
yeah we just needed a little bit more
reinforcement over there and okay now
we're we're not we're not starving the
rest of the pipeline woohoo it's much
better I just I have I just am so I'm so
hesitant to just say you know yeah go
ahead that way you're gonna have the
tech that you need going forward it's
future proof well that's never a good
idea exactly it's like so when I was
shopping for my car one of the reasons I
ended up with the Volt is that it is the
yes so the 2017 volt is the second model
year of the third generation design of
this car now you compare that one of the
other cars I was looking at was the
Honda clarity that is the first model
year it is an all-new actually it's an
all it was the all-new model year of a
completely new car that's what mine is
which is terrifying because from one car
manufacturer to another I don't think
there are any exceptions here that I'm
aware of the all-new platform tends to
have some bugs that need to be wrinkled
out and that do get fixed over the next
two to three so yeah I bought my cars
used for suresies and they were like
done with that model by the time I
bought the car and I knew any potential
problems that it might have to be clear
so that helps a lot yeah but in my case
I was going in completely cold on the
clarity yeah they only had a handful of
them for Canada apparently so I just
yeah wolfies we're like it could be a
super-awesome I think it probably will
be a great card I I think a lot of the
the media right now I think a lot of the
fans are confused by some of the media
reaction because the media is really
frustrated that we don't have
performance stuff there's been really
weird embargo set ups and that tom-toms
article just set everyone on fire but
like themselves on fires what they did
it sounds really cool yeah I'm not
scared of this card like I don't think
it's gonna if if the r-tx stuff doesn't
work that great you just turn it off so
use so you can hate a lot of things
about NVIDIA you can hate their
marketing you can hate their prices you
can hate their you can hate the way that
they engage with the market and with
their partners with the geforce partner
program yeah but you're you're probably
missing something like there's problem
problem likely exists between the
keyboard and chair unless you're a
member of the Linux community because
they really haven't treated that
community very well over the years but
there's probably something else wrong if
you look at the product itself and you
go you know it's bad yeah they're good
it's not bad yeah you can have a lot of
problems with Nvidia with Nvidia
products but as a general rule they
aren't bad they might not be the best
value per dollar for the the particular
workload that you're looking at but
there are a lot of things that in
fairness to in video we have to give
them credit for they support legacy
products for an unfreaking believable
amount of time like how far does it go
back now and I'm actually I'm quite I'm
quite curious if you go on their site
how far back does the latest geforce
driver go so let's throw ten series in
here so they still got downloads on
their site going all the way back to
geforce what crap it keeps scrolling
geforce six series and their most recent
driver so they've only goes up to
windows 7 but bear in mind you can
typically install the windows 7 driver
Windows 10 they supported that card up
to 2015 okay so the 6800 GT ultra I did
they launched with it I think they
launched with the GT so the 6800 GT was
launched in - no here we go was launched
in 2004 they supported that card for
yeah I'll let well it's February 2015 it
1004 so 10 years when you compare that
to what the typical smartphone
manufacturer will do like Apple Apple's
a shining beacon in the smartphone
industry in terms of model support I was
looking at a table of how long Apple has
supported their devices and it's
anywhere from three years and and lots
of change like almost four to four and a
half years in some cases even a little
over four and a half years when even
Google is only committing what two years
I think for pixel devices I think one
plus is committing to OS updates so
about two years we got to give them
credit for what they do do well it's not
a bad product someone in chat is saying
they just bully partners to buy old
cards that not sure I don't know I have
no idea are you talking I don't know
what it means and that's literally the
point we're talking about is that the
products we're yeah so you might not
like other things yeah there can be all
kind of principal and I'm sure you could
find a dozen reasons to do it that's not
the point the point is that we don't
have a reason to believe that the
upcoming r-tx cards will be bad yeah we
just also don't have a reason to believe
that RT X will be the game-changing
feature that they say it will or that
the RT X cards will fully enable the the
will give you the full experience of
that as new games come out over the
coming years and hopefully hopefully
hopefully it does hopefully it does
hopefully we're totally wrong but we
have no idea cool but until Nvidia is
willing to it's not even that we're
wrong we just don't have any information
yeah until they're willing to
shut up like what are we supposed to say
you can't test our TX then we can't form
an opinion yeah so right now all we can
do is speculate based on the past and in
the past I've observed this pattern so
that's all I can really tell you guys
yeah all right let's have a look at oh
yeah so right there finally talking
about performance and these slides
aren't like exceedingly helpful but it's
pretty usual yeah so as per usual
they're just kind of vague but there you
go we've got something to work with here
the original sources from overclocked 3d
dotnet but I'll that's deep learning
imaging so they're saying both r-tx 20
80 and 20 80 TI are going to be capable
of 4k 60fps gaming what the crap does
this line mean I not sure is this zero
is this thirty I'm not sure this is
actually like pretty much the worst not
be worse
but it's like it's closed today yeah
it's pretty dumb and cuz like what what
actually goes down this is it the
framerate
is it the resolution is it both but like
by weird events like this is basically
what is causing all of this speculation
around RT action that like maybe it
sucks because Nvidia is just and this
looks like kind of a dumb response to
all of it because Nvidia is just being
so tight-lipped about the whole thing
and just going no no ray-tracing
ray-tracing ray-tracing and when really
a lot of gamers especially the ones that
are playing games that won't have
ray-tracing like I don't know that's
another thing I got from the demo you
will not want it on for multiplayer well
yeah like ever at all like err ever I
don't think ever really why because
there's more shadows well I see and like
darker shadows because if you definitely
know where the light source is coming
from yeah instead of just like washing a
room with light it's gonna there's gonna
be like oh there's like a branch that
crosses the light source here so there's
a huge shadow cast across that whole
area okay wait I am going to pitch you
something here okay what
about Rainbow six Rainbow six
specifically like seizures I'm talking
about I'm talking about Rainbow six
style games okay so yeah siege is the
one everyone's playing right now yeah
yeah yeah we're basically interacting
with the environment is a huge part of
the gameplay so if you could hit a light
causing a shadow of an opponent to
appear somewhere the more realistic that
interaction potentially the better just
hit a light like if you shoot out a bulb
or something
turn away off though yes what what if
you could add one would she throw a
flare I'm just I'm just throwing that
out there what if they made it a
fundamental cuz this is the whole
conversation that I'm sure we've had
multiple times but I've had definitely
with a lot of people over the years
going all the way back to when physics
was first introduced and what was that
stupid game shoot I forget it was like a
like a Space Marine style like running
around game but physics was a
fundamental part of the gameplay demo
game Borderlands no no no no no it was
helped me was faster in if you had a
intel SSD you know it was basically a
demo like whit this is before the nvidia
sella factory yeah so factor yes thank
you
good call Ricky dog Thank You self actor
Rick young sorry
no not cell factory yeah like it it
disappeared it never got finished but
there was like like you could like do
physics things and like move stuff
around and like it was wait was it so
factored no no it wasn't roblox I think
I think it was self factor as far as I
know it like never got finished yeah I'm
pretty sure it was selfish anyway anyway
anyway
the point is it was this cool demo where
physics was a fundamental core part of
gameplay but you
never took off because you couldn't
count on everyone to have PhysX I mean
especially because at the time it was it
was like a hardware car to buy it was a
separate accelerator card um this whole
thing feels very physics but built into
the card yeah but the thing is is that
we've had physics built into the card
and still all you can do is kick garbage
around on the ground as Batman and see
your cape flutter better because of
physics like it's still not a core part
of gameplay so to me I think you could
if if the rainbow six developers were
like yeah we're gonna take the
destructibility of the environment and
the lighting of the environment to a
whole new level but I have Artie I think
no game that's actually going to be
competitive would ever do that an even
playing field for hardware is not
something that has ever gone well for
competitive no and requiring people to
have super high end hardware is just not
a thing I guess that's where I'm going
with this is that you you won't be able
to make it fundamental to gameplay
unless you can count on you if you can
set up if you if you can like shoot a
door off a car and then use the
reflections off the door to like see
someone come around the corner yeah like
that sounds freaking sweet yeah
sounds pretty single-player to me dude
yeah like I don't think that's gonna be
a thing and it sounds single-player but
like not which is a cool the game play
single-player games are great there was
a very recently there's a thread
trending on I don't remember what that
was talking about how it's like people
that just don't play multiplayer games
anymore and all those kind of stuff and
there's actually a lot of really great
single-player game so I've been coming
out for a while there's quite a few
great single-player games on the horizon
and you might even find like PvE
multiplayer games we don't care as much
okay and you might just want the
lighting because you want to look really
cool and that might all that's all great
that's all awesome not saying there
isn't benefits to it I just think like
people who want to be hardcore
competitive yep
I don't think that's gonna be a thing it
probably won't even be an option and I'm
just saying until you can make it
fundamental to gameplay it's always it's
always a bell and whistle
and there's some people that will care
yeah definitely some people but just
like gameplays King like you know yeah
we're then I completely do this the
switch doesn't look any better than what
like a ps3 if that so is it even it does
it even look as good as a ps2 hard thing
to compare this is the ps3 come out if
you define look as good that would be
like what resolution and framerate it
can push but Nintendo titles on general
have like a way different art style
which they do they do doesn't need more
hardware but that's exactly the point is
like gameplay is more important
oh yeah and lighting I've had more fun
of my switch physics for a long time
then my computer rip honestly 95 percent
of my gaming time in the last few months
has been Zelda breath as well oh yeah
that's great it's a great game I'm not
done yet but like I don't care cuz I
just go and like walk around the
mountains and like find snails yeah and
like dude tennis aces actually super fun
yeah I was like when I got it I was like
it's a full-price tennis title played
over cooked hmm no but it looks real I
tried it for the first time last week
it's really good yeah so we're gonna
when we do the land do you know what
l'Alliance enter yeah I was there when
we made the decision to sick okay so
when we build the land center I want to
put like a big screen like a projector
yeah and that'll be so we'll have
consoles and PC with controllers but I
want that to be like the the local
multiplayer yeah set up spot and we are
gonna play some overcooked hell yeah for
sure that finally I'm actually so
excited for that LAN Center me too
I haven't washed it yet but it was cool
that you had nothing up here yeah do you
even did you know not much yeah I had to
like stream a PDA him before but like it
I didn't feel bad cuz he like he was
like yeah I think I'm sure watch your
videos before it was like an Intel thing
to kind of put us together yeah actually
I had a lot of fun just doing this
stream with him so that we know he's
cool yeah I couldn't believe it
when
chicken dinner the one pub G match that
he got to play as part of his father
surprise
so like still though even if you're
really good he got like eight kills yeah
so okay so what happened was Intel
sponsored him to come up here as part of
gamer days to build a PC with me so my
commitment was to build a PC for him and
then he was supposed to stream for like
a few hours after we built the PC just
like from our office here on that PC or
the exact same spec but like it was
actually whatever yeah yeah anyway the
point is his flight got delayed so we
had to throw the machine together we did
like a super quick build like I was
cutting like he got here late yeah yeah
and then he only got to stream for like
one round and then the fact that he
wanted I was when he was on his way I
was like yeah way to go man that's
pretty cool that's awesome
that's freaking awesome you won your
first game didn't you I did yeah but I
didn't kill anyone
it's still one carry me and go and Joe
and then who else didn't know it was
that Dennis later I think I think that
was dead yeah we had basically a
three-man squad now to be clear just
because I didn't kill anyone doesn't
mean I didn't help he did help I
actually did a fair amount of damage to
you because you were pinging people with
the sniper I'm I'm a good I'm a good
helper and I can communicate you're
spotting making calls and hitting people
at least once with a sniper which is
like actually a huge help because you
only need to hit them once or twice and
say just say the same not that bad
speaking of not that bad we should talk
about our sponsors cuz they're not that
bad yeah yeah meanwhile like poor poor
yard watches here is like really clearly
they've never sponsored - tech tips
before so these are handcrafted using
sustainably sourced hardwoods from
around the world
so yard I'm glad I'm saying yard because
they're Swedish that's good
you're a Swedish for Earth which is
where they draw their inspiration from
so they have designs for men and women
they have battery or automatic power
they use quartz movement and they have
something for everyone now this one
needs to be adjusted to be the right
size for me but here I can give you guys
a look at that check that out
that's a I like the square one better
really yeah what do you think I like
mine but I see why you like yours well
you know what's funny they actually
picks out design specifically I think
that worked out which is which is
actually pretty cool so the whole thing
it's a really nice wall so it comes with
extra links this is I don't generally
I'm not a stylish kind of guy no but
like I wish I wish I had one link out of
it because then it would then it would
fit perfectly but that looks really
sharp so they do free worldwide shipping
the one that I had was pretty good the
Del Mar series so that's a dark
sandalwood with an obsidian carbon watch
face so you can actually see they're
like the carbon the carbon fiber finish
on there looks really nice and then
Luke's is in a dark sandalwood this is
the Frankie series with an emerald watch
face so if you guys use offer code LTT
oh the box is magnetic oh geez so
glasses if you use offer code ltte
you'll get $25 off and a free sizing at
yard watches dot-com we're gonna have
that linked in the video description oh
man I want it yeah I want to get this I
want to get this size and then like this
is the kind of thing that I could
actually the clasp is where yeah no no
mine's different oh I think I've seen
that style but it goes in both
directions
oh oh yeah which makes it actually wait
you have big hands but they didn't feel
that I needed that I guess Oh your
watches these guys you guys are gonna
I'm gonna keep that safe I'm gonna have
to deal with that later
alright other sponsor did I just get
burned did I just get burned
by a first-time sponsor they picked my
sizing li perfectly glasses all right
mystery meat which one do you want dad
yeah that was me picking essentially
actually didn't really look carefully
which was like I think that's the small
one I think that's the one that's better
for me but you know what I'm gonna wear
the boulder frames today because the
plaintiff spectrum just because they
look good doesn't mean that that's
necessarily why you would run out and
buy Spectrum glasses staring at a
monitor all day can be hard on your eyes
and also make it tougher to fall asleep
so spectrum is an affordable long-term
solution to staring at a computer screen
instead of using a software one like
flux which doesn't offer the same kind
of filtering that these glasses do so
they're high quality they come with a
one-year warranty the glasses are
durable they've got a ton of different
styles including ones for kids they have
low color distortions so they don't just
turn your entire world you're in yellow
which is nice but they block high-energy
blue light and while they're primarily
focused around the Canadian US markets
they do ship internationally so go check
them out at spectrum glasses comm slash
collections slash products and finally
an oldie but a goodie savage oh there we
go you know what I'm loosing out today
I'm just gonna eat some original because
I like original I'm gonna chill you can
eat whatever you want the reapers here
from last week Oh was it Riley that I
had on who tried the reaper how did he
do good good but it was spicy yeah yeah
I think it was Riley I had someone on a
little while ago Joe knows hovering do
you have something to tell us Joe no
you're doing a giveaway oh all right
well I'll get back to that once I tell
you guys about savage jerky I always
salivate but I'm opening up the bag me
too
wow they're jerky is made with high
quality ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives the goal I have to create
a snack that's full of flavor and spice
that isn't bad for you
they've got 13 different flavors of
jerky like sriracha bacon and maple
buffalo bacon which is my personal
favorite the Moho is also great the
original is good if your bland
like it's good they also make oh man
have you tried their their hot sauce no
okay you took home didn't you yeah it's
really good oh no oh no I guess I did
did you we did the finger dab thing oh
that's right okay yeah it is as good as
I expected it's like freakin awesome so
uh to be clear I'm not being down on the
jerky but the hot sauce is really good
if you want to buy one thing from Savage
jerky I haven't actually tried the
rubber the barbecue sauce but if you
want to buy one thing from Savage jerky
get the hot sauce it was the I think it
was the Reaper hot sauce that that I
that I have in my in my fridge right now
it is so good I don't use a ton but the
flavor that it adds is really nice so
you guys can use offer code LTT to save
10% at Savage jerky dot-com what can I
do for you what are you doing
super chats we don't do we have super
chats
oh that's right we're streaming on
YouTube I forgot ah we read super chests
but we don't read twitch stuff so yet
well no we don't read super chats
because I completely forgot so there's
that we don't really have a policy these
are these are fake by the way but
they're like they're there oh the okay
kind of fake what does that mean
it's a long story but like you can get
in trouble for having fake money that is
too real oh so those are like fake
enough yeah so your watches has a
giveaway check it over and check it out
over at WWE or watches comm / g /l TT
which actually gets us perfectly into
our next segment here which I'm not even
sure if it's a topic this week oh yeah I
don't think this dedication to keeping
the office clean I know he's like doing
it but he's prone on the ground yeah
it's actually cooler than bracing I'm
embarrassed for him
um so this is great
Chrome hold on hold on someone in chat
where do I get my r-tx on shirt oh um
designed by humans LTTE I'll post it in
the chat oh wait ltte I guess I should
probably put - dunno here it is yeah
just Google designed by humans Linus
tech tips you'll find it yeah it's fine
I got it I got it I'll throw in the
child throw in the chat cool oh right -
chats oh lordy well there it is in
twitch chat oh oh I'm a bad youtuber
officially officially 10 out of 10 bad
youtuber because I completely forgot
that we were even streaming on YouTube I
streamed earlier on YouTube so I you
know I got going for me I can't even
find it I don't even see the stream here
and the thing someone in the super chat
says I wonder if LTTE YouTube channel
going to do the community join thing
like with the join button on channel ah
that is a great question and one that I
would love to answer for you give me a
moment I'm just gonna post that thing
there yes there um so we are but
floatplane is not going away
so this is something that luke and I I
think talked about on the LAN show a
little while ago when we were both kind
of independently having huge freak outs
and then together having a huge freakout
and then realise that it's not actually
a big deal yeah because the whole I
forget what it's called supporter
contributor sponsor I forget what it's
called when someone who's called sponsor
clicks that button but basically it's
like a twitch it's like a twitch sub in
this title join is it okay yeah join
it's a join button but I don't remember
what you become so when someone does
that they pay money and it helps support
the creator and also gives some money to
Google and other than that yeah I think
you get some like emojis but there's
there's not a ton of tangible benefits
so there's no early access so in it
already right out of the gate it doesn't
compete with floatplanes well what we
consider to be at least one of
floatplanes sort of dominant features is
early access to video so there you go
if there's not actually as much overlap
as you might think and to the way that
we see it both for supporters and for
creators there is always going to be the
people who wouldn't go off platform like
just have no interest in leaving
youtube.com and would do want to support
- Media Group but they want to do on
youtube.com there's always going to be
those people and then there's always
going to be the people that don't want
to give Google a dollar y'all turn on
adblock they will refuse any kind of
contribution that gives Google a cut and
for those people there's always gonna
have to be a third party option and we
see ourselves especially in the
direction that we're going right now as
being able to be a very strong third
party option so life is not as simple as
this one or this one why not both maybe
they could just coexist I mean we always
said we're not a YouTube competitor and
that's true so we're just gonna have to
keep not being a YouTube competitor and
I guess I'm speaking as floatplane media
Linus right now as opposed to youtuber -
Media Group Linus but then from Linus
media group's perspective we have always
been all about diversification yeah
that's why we joined vessel that's why
we started Linus tech tips com forum
that's why we reached out to partners
directly to bake sponsorships into our
videos rather than being entirely
dependent on Adsense because we don't
want to be completely reliant on Google
because Google is actually there on a
bit of a run right now towards us
because I know other creators have had
some issues with them yeah but for us
they're on a bit of a run right now
where they've been actually supporting
us really well but the thing is that you
can't necessarily count on that lasting
forever because we've had situations
where there was no communication from
Google and all of a sudden there's these
guidelines for how they're not going to
allow you to have sponsors built into
your content anymore unless you adhere
to all these like weird rules like you
can't show any logos in your video yeah
but that was awkward trying to explain
to someone likes
space yeah we can talk about your
service and we can have our site be
built with Squarespace and we can say
you know without Squarespace and it's
really cool but we can show your logo on
screen they'd be like me like well so
the issues that if we do that then you
have to buy through Google all of the
advertising on that video but then I
don't know how that works cuz you can't
buy it perpetually they don't even have
a system for that yeah but what could
you possibly have been thinking so stuff
like that has happened in the past so
that's why someone wants to know if we
can add a manual monthly fee and flow
plane I mean I okay so actually from the
outside it has appeared as though
floatplane hasn't changed much in the
last four to six weeks but luke and I
actually had a really good meeting
yesterday and there's gonna be some big
updates coming hopefully next week right
yeah yeah so theoretically we're pushing
the the most important but probably the
hardest to tell one on Monday and then
there's there's more stuff coming right
after that yeah so so expect to see new
features actually happening over the
next little bit let's see should we do
another topic or should I talk about a
lot of the questions oh right right
right right right because I was saying
speaking of www chrome is like killing
www yeah I don't think it's one of our
actual topics in here this week but and
so you'll have to forgive me for not
having a ton of background on it but I
thought that was interesting because
technically there's no reason why line
is sexy calm and WWN is tek-tips calm
had to be the same thing in the past it
just happened that out of convenience
and out of sort of convention and habit
generally speaking webmasters tried to
make them the same thing because
consumers are lazy and they don't want
to type www.google.com
to to hijack someone who otherwise would
have intended to go to a different site
so maybe you can explain in more detail
how the crap that would work it well i
right now I'm not entirely sure and
usually I'd have some angle for this but
I've actually read a few threads on it
and there's a lot of people debating
each other on how exactly it's gonna
work so I don't I don't want to speak to
it too much if you are interested in it
there there's a lot of people talking
about it and you can definitely find
threads out there on your own but yeah
it gets pretty weird cuz there's there's
one camp where they're talking about
like well I don't remember how that was
supposed to work but like sub-domain a
pal
onto things yeah can maybe make it look
like you're somewhere else and like yeah
it's there's some weird stuff that you
might be able to do with it basically
it's right now it's an unknown yeah and
that's really scary from a web security
perspective especially because this
change feels very unnecessary I think I
think honestly I think the vast majority
of it or all of it is known I think the
implications of it are a little
confusing yes and hard to understand and
a lot of people are talking about it
when not a lot of people understand
what's actually happening this is a
great super chat BK lb yo I'm late to
the show what are the specs core clock
memory clock gimme gimme gimme
it'll be archived also YouTube live
streaming has a great feature where you
could actually rewind it we talked about
our text for the first half of the show
thanks man
Calvin says thanks for the beanbag chair
is that actually the guy that we just
like gave a big beanbag chair to for no
reason I've no I can't remember why we
did it I just remember being like oh
yeah sure whatever let's just do it and
I think we were trying to get rid of it
or something maybe um maybe he like paid
for it but like it was just a little bit
I don't I don't remember exactly what
happened
Oh a lot of people were wondering what
was up with that weird livestream last
night so that was a new YouTube feature
called premieres and what happened
premier's is that it seems like it hits
you guys with a notification early and
then you're supposed to come back and
watch the video at exactly the moment it
goes live and there's a live chat but
the video is actually pre produced so
there were a lot of people that seemed
to be upset because they were like this
isn't live pre-recorded pre-recorded
hashtag pre-recorded and yes it's it was
supposed to be pre-recorded yeah so this
is actually a feature that and Luke and
I still have some ideas that are
different and could be better but this
was actually a feature that we had
discussed doing on flame like two years
ago like two years ago but Deb takes
time anyway the point is the idea behind
it is that it is a normal video but we
schedule when it goes live now we often
schedule our videos but in this case
we're scheduling it in a way that you
guys can see so you'll know exactly when
to come back with your popcorn and hang
out in the chat and like talk interact
live with each other and or me it was
actually me and Nick that were both
Manning the Linus tech tips account last
night and give commentary on the video
as you're watching it as you're all
watching it together and then as soon as
that premiere is done then it just a
switch flips and it becomes just a
normal YouTube video neat huh yeah
Andrew asks if I will talk about
conservatives being banned from YouTube
and Twitter if you're talking
specifically about Alex Jones no I won't
I will not be talking about that Thank
You great question that's a way to get
banned on YouTube oh here's a question
for you yeah if Alex Jones okay came to
user and said I want to be on floatplane
Shore what do you say sure good me too
so people we won't want to clarify why
should we clarify why well because we
don't want to be we don't want it really
we just don't we're not even an open
platform you would have to pay to go see
his content so if you are going to be
offended by his content or driven off by
his content don't give him don't give
him money and you won't see a new fun
and the other thing too is like we do
draw the line at anything illegal
so I know that some people have
speculated that he's been banned because
of some pending lawsuits or whatever
else but that doesn't necessarily mean
that the content that he uploaded was
illegal actually don't know that it
wasn't frankly I haven't looked at I
don't either of us know almost anything
but until he did something illegal on
floatplane comm then there wouldn't
really be a conversation to be had about
it I don't I don't know almost anything
about them I know some people don't like
them and people are asking so would you
allow denying Sandy Hook on floatplane I
don't agree with it but as far as I can
tell it's not illegal so it don't give
her money yeah don't give him money
would be like the best suggestion
all right is that what he did is that
one everyone's angry but I really don't
know honestly he's been doing that for
years that's just a particularly stupid
thing that he's done yes that's weird no
it's a it's a very bizarre now someone
chest that he did not do that see I
don't know I can't keep on top of this
stuff I just don't care um oh do we have
to cover the iphone tennis tennis max
and ten are have you been have you kept
up with this I've been busy
yeah they seem like they're gonna be
fine oh I finally got my iPhone ten back
well it's not that I finally got it back
I finally are made it my face ideas been
broken for over 60 years
so apples are may process excellent they
send you a prepaid label it appears to
be like overnight because I got my new
phone back in three days or something
stupid like that like doorstep to
doorstep and I'm not I don't mean like
in 72 hours I mean
like I shipped it out midday here and
got it back at the beginning of the day
here like it's impressive that's pretty
good um
so that's that's cool so I'll have my
iPhone 10 to compare against it
I'm definitely getting both the 10s and
the 10s max D brand is is is working on
it so that's cool you guys can expect to
review you know eventually I'm at the
point now where I don't know if you saw
the the video that went up last night
I'm assuming I'm assuming not but it was
about why Google or how Google forced me
to make an iPhone 10s video so what I
had actually wanted to do was the switch
stream that I did today
not intend Oh switch network switch yeah
that's what I had wanted to do but
instead I I decided to make a 10s video
because over the last three years our
lowest point for viewership like our
weeks long lowest point for viewership
was the day after Apple announced a new
iPhone in September and I've seen people
suggest well maybe it's because it back
to school and that's a good hypothesis
but apples announcement is as much as a
week or ten days apart so theoretically
if it was because of back to school it
all happened like when school goes back
I don't believe Apple's announcement is
directly related to Labor Day also like
schools been in session for a little
while here yeah and basically what I
what I what I talked about was how you
just kind of have to do it because as
soon as someone watches an iPhone 10s
video you know how it is if you watch a
tractor video all of a sudden you've got
a bunch of farming videos and your feed
and all over your home page and
everything so as soon as someone watches
an iPhone 10s video dude I watched a
video on some guy mowing a lawn with a
like a sickle yep I didn't know there
was that many lawn mowing videos on the
Internet
I just exactly it wouldn't stop and so
what happens is if we don't have a 10s
video then the algorithm goes well these
guys are tech but not Apple and this
viewer is tech and Apple and they start
to skew the way that they feed them
videos and so so I was like ok you know
what screw it I'm sorry I don't know
whatever I'm just gonna do an iPhone 10s
video but I don't really feel like
talking about it anymore so they're like
better
stuff and also there's a 10 R that has
an LCD instead of an OLED why is there
so many different versions well there's
this there's the premium ones small big
and then there's the value one all of a
10 no tennis connects Ted two 10s ISM
one 10 are see we already got confused
and then the 10 goes away so what's been
typical on the past yeah that's that's
weird why ok my my my guess and
obviously no one's done tear downs of
these yet but my guess is that the 10 is
just too expensive to to to become like
a step-down model right just they don't
want to move yeah cuz it's got that dual
layer Pete that sandwich PCB with all
the sort like it looks incredibly
complex to manufacture yeah so that
that's my guess I think that's why the
10r came about instead of just keeping
the 10 I'm sure you've talked about this
before but someone in chat said notch
equals ruined what is your thoughts my
people's button ruined what are your
thoughts on notches cuz I don't think I
care so I don't mind the notch as long
as I can disable it but it actually does
bother me if I'm watching
21 by 9 content if I'm watching
widescreen content and I've got a a bite
out of the screen with my disabled so
one plus for example allows you to just
chop off the top of the display and as
long as you've got an OLED display those
pixels that are off they're just as
black as the glass around it yeah yeah
so it's just gone if I'm watching some
type of full screen content it would
chop off the not because I like the idea
of notifications and phone that's some
Android handset makers do do that but
not on the iPhone and so like playing a
game on an iPhone can notch on the edge
that's really stupid and I don't mind
the idea of the notch there if it just
has phone status on the right
notifications on the left
cool yeah if I have so many
notifications that they go all the way
across then that's actually kind of what
I have all the time but I'm not gonna be
able to tell what's happening from
looking at that notification bit anyway
so you have to pull it down regardless
so I don't care yeah but then all
fullscreen content should just not go up
there that's ridiculous
oh boy and that's been the debate over
the last over the last year yeah oh this
is this kind of sucks so one plus guys
are my bros and all that heart but
really so one plus it seems has been
confirmed yeah
looks like this is confirmed oneplus is
removing the headphone jack so what am I
gonna have left Samsung is the is the LG
v40 gonna have a headphone jack handy
v3e let's find out blah blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah can't tell the
site's loading slowly looks like it will
okay with their upgraded DAC so it looks
like the LG v40 is gonna continue all
its gonna have a notch bloody hell um so
then like that's it
like I'm not a Samsung fanboy or
anything in fact I'd put up that video
recently talking about how battery drain
issues that I've never known I ins
actually been better lately I'm at 66%
today which is about right from when I
was using the pixel to itself my phone's
brutal right now I need a new phone
yeah I've hardly touched mine actually
no I know I've actually used mine today
and it's at 66 my basically the screen
has been off all day pretty much and
it's draining 76 okay I mean that sounds
pretty good to me from the kinds of
issues that I've had but mine's behaving
well right now so it's a first gen picks
like so and I've thrashed it pretty hard
over the years but like what choice am I
gonna have anymore word on the street
Google's removing it oneplus is removing
it like 1 plus I actually had thought
there were gonna be the standout I
thought they were gonna hold out but
they're somewhat at the mercy of their
parent company right like they do their
own thing in certain ways like their
oxygen skin I think is better than their
parent company's skin just hands down
better some stuff they do differently
but because they're kind of
relatively small division I think they
do have to rely somewhat on the tooling
and on the investments of their parent
company and it looks like that's just
becoming the reality and smartphones now
is they need that extra space and they'd
rather use it for I think one plus a
statement said something about like more
innovative features or something
Android equals 60% chance to kaboom
that's yes what's that
someone in chat said Android phone
equals 60% chance to kaboom and that's
just what does that even mean I think
he's saying the battery's gonna explode
60 percent of time which is just
completely that's just a stupid thing to
say that wasn't a super chat was it no
cuz that's not super those from twitch
we got to figure out how we're doing
this because there's people that
subscribe and stuff on the twitch side
and like we can absolutely have twitch
donations too but we've never addressed
anyone on Twitter I think twitch is
gonna I think twitch is gonna probably
boot us at some point for our dual
streaming and being a partner so it
might not be a issue
[Laughter]
alright you know what let's do a couple
let's do a couple super chats towards
the end here I guess what kind of did
notice in the partner agreement that I
signed yeah it's actually only for
gaming
really I wonder if yours might be too no
that's interesting I'm allowed to do any
form of content on any other streaming
platform that isn't gaming or that is a
game that is not allowed on Twitch okay
yeah so Kang what do you think about
Apple products getting more and more
expensive yet there's less and less
innovation involved okay so first of all
I disagree because when a product
becomes Kamata sized it actually means
that in order to try to differentiate
you have to be more innovative going
from 14 nanometer down to 10 down to 7
just sounds like a linear progression
but it actually gets much more difficult
so there's just one thing right off the
hop number two is that integrating
better hardware that you just get from
someone else so you just buy the latest
reference design from Qualcomm and you
build a chassis around it and you bolt
some stuff to it
that is relatively easy designing a GPU
from the ground up building your own OS
your own cloud infrastructure for
backups like the kind of stuff that
Apple invests in is not not innovative
it just doesn't seem like it because a
lot of it's in the software so I don't
agree at all that Google and Apple are
not innovating I think it's just in a
way that's not as exciting to us
hardware geeks that's all it's just in a
way that's that just doesn't float my
boat and doesn't float your boat and I
think as it gets harder and harder yeah
it gets more expensive someone someone
in chat said dude you boys are the only
reason I'm on twitch oh well we're still
gonna be streaming to twitch until they
kick us off so I would also take that
almost the other way you can drop a
platform Adam okay normally I don't make
a point of calling out how much is super
chat donates but Adam put in 20 bucks
and then says pre-ordered my iPhone 10s
max that so Adam clearly can afford the
20 bucks how much this thing is in
Canada with everything isn't gonna be
like over two grand for the top-end
model yeah is that the top-end model I
don't know well no cuz there's different
capacities yeah okay yeah and Adam says
yes I have a problem yeah no kidding
what's your thoughts on the red phone
it's red no no no no oh which one is
this red company not red color oh no I
don't know about this what mkbhd has
been tweeting photos oh that red yeah
yeah yeah sorry I see I had project red
just like stuck in my brain I was like I
said red company because I know that
Apple had a project red what but like
project red now has their own phone
that's weird so I'm pretty pissed off to
be perfectly honest with you you didn't
get one uh
I did I ordered one I ordered two oh
yeah I ordered both SKUs
this is a snapdragon 835 based product
that still isn't here and that for some
reason even though i pre-ordered at the
same time as anybody else other people
are getting exclusive sneak peaks with
and I haven't seen hide nor hair of it
and the weird the really stupid thing
like okay actually huh you know what
okay let's talk about the red hydrogen
one so I got an email from red and we're
actually gonna be collaborating with red
on an upcoming project hopefully I'm not
jeopardizing that right now but it does
then I guess that is what it is but I
got an email from red inviting me to be
part of a select few customers who will
get the hydrogen one early for the
purposes of providing beta user feedback
which is not inherently a problem except
for one key thing I'm just I want to
make sure that I get this right because
it's very important hydrogen one
following up on your interest about
hydrogen one is this it no they invited
me to some event and I was like no I
can't make it where is it
shoot houdini project is that what it's
called
yes here we go so I just need to make
sure I've got the right email okay so
this is ridiculous so you you get the
phone early but you have to you can't
talk about it so I was like well if I
can't review it I don't want it early
because it's not a retail unit it is a
Pvt sample so that is a pre mass
production unit to be very clear the
thing a normal company does with the PBT
sample is destroy it because it is not
like industry standard not considered
suitable to deliver as an as a final
product to an end-user now I wouldn't
have a problem with this if Reds
intention was to take beta feedback and
then take your Pvt back and send you an
MP unit but they are not what you are
agreeing to is that you will not
get on past production unit and this is
for a phone that you pets paid $1000 for
or whatever is that not ridiculous so
the terms and conditions of this Houdini
project were just utterly ridiculous to
me I already read one insane thing yeah
so I do intend to talk about that in my
hydrogen-1
that one line that I read is because
that is not the way you do business so
anyway on that note um thank you for
watching the land show and we will see
you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel oh wait
whoa what the heck someone just sent a
two hundred dollar super chat i Ambler

recent gaming upgrade vid please use

cleaning service and record the
nastiness for channel super fun I can't
we can't do something like that I mean
