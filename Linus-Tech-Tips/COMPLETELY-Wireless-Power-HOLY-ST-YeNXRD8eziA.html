you just plunk down your phone on a
little pad to get juiced up which is
really cool
way better than wires but they only work
over very short distances and they need
to be correctly aligned for optimal
efficiency well what if I told you that
there's a better way what if I told you
that this speaker right here and these
trains going around me are all being
powered by that space eg looking light
fixture up there that there is the
prototype of why charges long-range
wireless power delivery system and holy
is this thing ever cool
Kable mods configurator service makes it
easy to customize and order cables for
your rig and customers in Europe now
have their own configurator where cable
mod handles all duties import taxes and
documentation check it out at the link
below so this right here is the
transmitter and although I guess
technically it could work if we just
plugged it in while I'm holding it I
definitely get tired of hauling it
around and also this is the only
prototype in existence that can deliver
the amount of power that we are going to
need today so if I dropped it that would
be pretty tragic I wouldn't do that
deploying the transmitter is
surprisingly simple if you have a drop
ceiling so this prototype is actually
held in place by these magnets
oh and zip ties this is for quick and
easy testing but production models
should have more permanent fixtures once
it secured all we need to do is plug it
into a regular DC power source okay so
this light right here is just a regular
light and then this one around the rim
is more of a status indicator so while
it's booting up it blinks blue and then
once it's green it means that it's
actually good to go the really cool tech
though is actually this black bit in the
middle which is an infrared window
behind which is an IR transmitter and
then this right here is also an infrared
window and behind that is a receiver so
if I just put this let's say for example
right here and it does need
line-of-sight yeah there's a second good
so if
I just take this phone and place it
let's say right here on my ladder and
boom it's charging and if you look up
here the status indicator changes to
solid blue but how is it doing that from
up top the transmitter is actually
projecting some very high energy
infrared light and the receiver is
basically like a solar panel so there's
a special photovoltaic cell in here that
is tuned to the infrared beam that the
transmitter is outputting and now I know
what you guys are thinking I was
thinking the same thing it's this entire
room being blasted with infrared
radiation right about now am I gonna
turn into like a mutant more importantly
will night TV remote stop working the
answer is no not at all
so the receiver has a very specific
signature that the transmitter looks for
and when it sees it it shoots out a very
thin IR beam basically like a laser
directly at the receiver which is pretty
cool but what makes it loads better is
the transmitters ability to track a
moving receiver so I thought that this
demo was smoking mirrors when I first
saw it back at Computex last year but
these trades right here can be fully
powered by the transmitter up in the
ceiling giving you some idea of how
quickly your phone or your other device
could be moving around the room and
still be powered and/or charging and to
prove that the trains have no batteries
the instant the beam is broken the train
stopped once line of sight has been
restored it just takes a second or two
and then power transmission will resume
this means that there's no way for a
person or like your eyes or something to
be exposed to the high-energy beam and
the FDA and other international safety
regulators have already given it the
seal of approval
plus you get to feel like a magician
okay so what you're probably wondering
now though is how much power can it
actually deliver
well why charge brought two different
models here there's this smaller one
that seemed more like Internet of Things
applications this can deliver about one
watt while having a smaller footprint
making a little more subtle then there's
the larger one that we put on the
ceiling that can do up to three watts so
this is one of their receivers hooked up
to a speaker not bad
what if we try to go to hi punks out a
little bit
now let's hook up a larger receiver that
they've got here this one does
one-and-a-half watts and see how much
louder we can go
not bad that's too shy of max volume but
I mean if we're being entirely honest
here that's still not a whole ton of
power and like if I wanted to charge my
phone or heaven forbid a tablet a watt
and a half isn't a ton and putting a
case like this on it is probably not
that practical fortunately this guy is
more of a proof of concept and why
charges first commercial product makes a
lot more sense so this guy right here is
a Qi charger with regular USB on the
underside that can be placed anywhere in
the room and still receive power so for
something like a coffee shop they could
offer charging at their tables without
running cords every single one of them
and that way if someone wants to
relocate the table to sit with their
friends it's totally not a big deal they
would just kind of go like that and
bippity Boppity when it is wirelessly
charging what makes it really well
integrated is the fact that it's it's
actually in the table like this like
obviously we're not gonna drill a big
hole in our table in order to do that
right now and the fact that it has a
battery inside it so that acts as a
buffer so that battery can trickle
charge all day and all night and then
when someone plugs in or puts their
phone down on the pad it'll be able to
charge at more than just you know three
quarters of a watt and it won't matter
if somebody you know is in the middle of
a really really you know fascinating
conversation and blocks the beam for a
little while and this is just the
beginning I'm really excited to see
where this tech is going I mean just how
much power will they be able to get out
of these systems in the future hood
receivers just be built right into your
phone or tablet and a little with a
little you know window right there I
mean that would allow your device to
trickle charge all day long if you're in
range of a transmitter maybe this will
finally be the solution
to what has been the biggest problem
with smartphones those pesky headphone
jacks no not those battery life thermal
takes view 37 mid tower case features an
enlarged transparent gullwing window
panel design and remarkable expansion
with support for up to ATX motherboards
and multiple drive bays it's got a fully
modular design it supports vertical and
horizontal radiator placement and it
comes with two pre-installed ring 14 LED
fans or you can actually get the full
RGB variant check it out today at the
link below to learn more so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you clearly hate technology and you're
on the wrong tenor but if you liked it
hit the like button get subscribed or
check out the link to where to buy the
stuff we featured in the video
description just kidding it's still
prototypes you can't buy it yet but at
some point you will also linked in the
description is our merch store which has
cool tricks like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join that this speaker right here and
these trains running around me blood</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
