though it will for you this is the ocz
vertex 3 so this is a very very exciting
product because it comes as a successor
and as a worthy successor to the vertex
2 which is pretty much dominated the SSD
market for the past considerable amount
of time so that the vertex 10 CC had
competitors that were like competing
controllers that were not into links
which was used by ocz as well as a
number of others at the time out on the
market such as in Intel where
performance was not necessarily the
strongest argument for getting a vertex
one especially later on in the life
cycle with the vertex two there hasn't
been that much that's been closed or
beaded in terms of performance and but
but it was still a pretty close race you
had competitors like the crucial c300
that were pretty close largely in part
largely in part largely due to the fact
that they used aceite 36 gigabit per
second control interface so the vertex 3
changes all that it gives us a new
sandforce controller this is an SF f
2200 sandforce controller and it also
upgrades the interface to save a 36
gigabit per second so the one I have
here today is in an anti-static bag
comes packed in a foam thing like this
the retail drives probably come with a
two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half inch
adapter but this one is clearly a bit
too early of a sample for such niceties
to be included the drive itself will
come with vertex 3 branding on the top
of it but you can clearly see here that
this is just a plain black drive with a
silver bottom this is a 240 gig version
although the drive is available in 120
240 and 480 good configurations now the
480 gig at the time of filming is not
really a compelling value at just over 6
hundred dollars or maybe it's like
eighteen hundred dollars Rita it's very
very high it's far more than double the
price of the 240 whereas a 240 is
approximately double the price of a 120
and so it should be and 120 is
approximately double the price of it and
another 60 gig on the market plus a
premium for the advanced controller that
goes into this so the vertex 3 uses
updated 25 nanometer flash it uses as I
mentioned before and sff 2200 controller
it uses a se23 interface so if you want
to come and have a closer look at the
interface here there's your state of
power and there's your state of three
interface which looks exactly like say
22 because all of the changes that have
gone on are actually on this side of the
interface rather than on the connector
themselves you've got all of your
standard mounting holes so you've got
your sides here as well as your bottom
mounting hole so that means you'll be
able to mount this in pretty much any
laptop as long as it doesn't take a very
small 1.8 inch SSD or if it has
non-standard mounting which is very very
rare so pretty much will fit in any
laptop and with an adapter it'll fit in
pretty much any desktop in terms of
other changes ocz well okay let's let's
talk about things that aren't changes so
it still supports trim which means that
if you're running the Windows 7 OS it
will automatically clean up any deleted
data and optimize it so that you're not
going to experience any slowdown as the
SSD gets into a what is called a used
state okay so it does feature trim and
is also fully raid capable now this is
something that pretty much everyone puts
on their SSD packaging and it's always
been a little bit confusing to me but
they've capable I can have a kind of
look at the drive for a little bit rate
capable basically just means SSDs
perform extremely well in raid which has
been true since day one and will likely
remain true it uses mlc flash which is
not as durable as slc flash but should
still be just fine for consumer level
use and it has added speaking of
consumer level use it comes with a
three-year warranty and as I mean
between failure of 2 million hours ok so
like we've seen with previous
generations of SSDs the specs are
actually slightly different for the
different capacity so the 240 gig has a
max read of 550 Meg's a max right of 520
Meg's per second and random right at
four kilobyte this is aligned of 60,000
I ops the 120 gig is slightly slower
rights at only 500 megabytes per second
and the for 80 gig is actually
significantly slower with only 530
megabytes per second read for 50
megabytes per second right and random
right 4k I ops of only 40,000 so the I
apps are actually the same for the 120
and the to 40 gig drive so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the vertex 3
240 don't forget to subscribe to Linus
