then we're going to water coolant we're
gonna have a full budget of $500 $300
for our computer and a maximum of $200
for the water cooling parts but there's
a twist we cannot use any off-the-shelf
PC water cooling gear nada
yeah scrapyard Wars scrapyard Wars - and
thus gravity on this all depends so
let's keep it safe so nice guys at the
metal Mart they actually looked us up in
between the first time we were there in
the second time and they said to us you
guys aren't just some two-bit guy in a
camera you guys you guys have got a lot
of subscribers on that there YouTube and
they actually offered us a discount on
the metal but because I'm an honest
competitor who never cheats I didn't
accept it and but we're gonna we're
gonna mention the metal Mart anyway just
because they they seem to be pretty
pretty good guys they let us film in the
store they have lots of metal everything
I know about them so this is interesting
Luke's back and he's parked in an
unusual place I think he might be
leaving some space to work in the garage
wonder what he's up to back there so I
was China I was yelling I was saying so
I guess you guys are probably in the
garage but I think that's my answer
doesn't say anything about my camera
person staying out and showing me the
footage later
like my decision-making here is going to
come down to measure never cut a whole
bunch of times
which I guess falls under the do's we
say not as we do and tala because I
would always say measure twice cut once
but I'm not going to go as bad as Linus
and like counterweight this motherboard
with the Titan X and a 780ti so you
don't have to worry about that I'm going
to do shallow cuts so I'm going to cut
not nearly as far as I need to and just
try to kind of keep on creeping it a
little bit closer for tubing I don't
know whether or not I want to use this
copper tubing for the whole thing or not
it's probably possible but I don't know
because I have no idea what I'm going to
end up with in terms of radiator pumps
so I don't really want to dedicate
myself to anything
never works right so we're at my house
now because sloop took over the garage
at the at the office and it's time to do
some test fit stuff with our with our
scrap yard pcs all right this is my this
is where I practice my knife throwing
and this is where I'll be finding out if
my plans to bend the copper or even even
remotely have any basis in reality so
what I wanted to do was actually use the
bender from our hard pipe liquid cooling
so so we used this for bending and I am
actually going to try to do it with
copper if I can bend it 90 then I think
I'm safe so what I'll have to do is
disassemble the computer fully cut apart
the case and then as long as I can bend
the copper into 90s then I will pretty
much try to fill in as many of the gaps
as I can with copper tubing as you can
see we're probably not going to get the
entire length in there but I'm certainly
going to try and put in as much as I can
twist it as it bends that I didn't know
that I probably won't be able to do well
thanks to you though I don't know let me
just try this okay the fact that we
can't use tools we don't have access to
makes this a little tougher cuz
otherwise I'd be blowing my entire
budget oh it's gonna kink okay okay okay
that's fine that's fine we can solve out
that off so let's try um a larger radius
okay whoa now murid
I want to disrupt as little of the the
nice part of this as I can
okay we might be screwed though try and
go for something very gradual here yeah
holding having this help down better
isn't going to help a lot but for now
what we're doing is mostly
experimentation yep okay so a kink again
is that ruined this part of it yes so
we're gonna cut it off here for sure
okay okay alright so if you have the
right tools for the job
that's okay we'll find a will find a way
I'm not gonna I'm not going to be
defeated by this but this obviously is
it going inside the case obviously it
was probably obvious to a lot of our
viewers before I figured it out but I've
caught up now how to bend copper pipe
and tubing without crushing it step 1
fill it with salt straighten it out to
begin oh okay this this might actually
work this is probably how they do it
okay so here let's take this out into
the driveway
okay well I obviously can't leave this
stupid copper tube in my driveway so we
need to move it to my backyard which is
the only place I have that's big enough
to keep it oh you hit the treat this
doesn't really get me any closer to
figuring out how much space it's going
to take up in here how tightly I can
coil it and and if and how much is going
to need to come outside of the case so
you know what we can do for the next few
minutes here before we wrap up is start
tearing this thing down so I'm picking
up a radiator we have to be there in 20
minutes it would be out of the store in
23 minutes how big of a red you yeah
just a this small it's essentially it's
it's for computer so really small is
good a heater core yeah
probably yeah
something that size could that be about
the right size yeah I know that actually
this is perfect yeah that's perfect
there you go okay that's gonna work for
ya that'll totally work that's not too
small that's that great yeah without
you're gonna give that Honda Civic
router everybody yeah this that's way
bigger than this yeah yeah that's more
appropriate size I didn't even know
these were a thing but yeah if this can
take just water then which I'm sure
amber I'll take one of these this one I
guess yeah sure okay yeah
how does fifty bucks now sure yeah okay
cool that was easy oh man it's it's
great it's the the fittings are way
smaller than I expected this will fit in
the computer this just looks like a
normal computer radiator except these
things were welded on there which could
be great yeah so let's go okay so I got
the pump it was a little bit expensive
it was twice the price of the one that I
was expecting to buy but the radiator
that I got was half the price of the
radiator that I thought I was going to
buy so it's probably okay it's actually
threaded if I open this up and look
inside its a threaded pump these are the
threaded little knobs that he gives me
and these are fine but I could replace
them if I really needed to so tomorrow
when I go to Home Depot or whatever if I
really need to replace them so I can get
copper on there whatever that's totally
possible I don't think I'm going to do
that as this was expensive in itself and
the budget is starting to wane but
that's okay because I basically have
everything but yeah expensive pump but I
think we'll be good
scrapyard wars will return right
beautiful morning birds are all like
tripping and stuff now I don't think I
have his number you know what okay no
maybe we'll do this in like half an hour
let's go fill the copper pipe with sugar
up the tree
fiddle-dee-dee okay this is not my
greatest idea ever there's not much
growing between the trees now I just
have to decide well if I'm gonna fall to
my death I guess I want to following my
own yard so my wife doesn't have to have
that awkward conversation with the
neighbor so I'm going to climb the
right-hand-side tree if we were smart we
would have actually marked out on the
extension cord how high I have to go
okay I'm trying to get the trying to get
the funnel out oh no the funnel is not
quite small enough no hold on hold on
maybe well it like kind of meets up
perfectly oh no no I can probably make
it work anyway yeah I'll just spill some
it's okay I got this yeah it's not
draining anymore okay I can put it a
little up out that sprayed sugar all
over me oh you know what it's not
draining at the top and I can hear it
moving
I could probably now that I think about
it I could probably lift it up ten feet
above my head says we have six minutes
of
a filming land okay uh what about the
other card the other card in the camera
yeah okay um oh I wish we were having
this problem at a different time
hold on just let me oh my but my right
but totally asleep okay okay so here's
our tuck taped copper to here's our top
tech taped copper tube here this is
where I've got the the copper tube and
the extension cord tied off so basically
the filling process looked a little
something like like this I used to have
a funnel it fell so this is how we know
that it's full because I try to pour
things and it just falls down the tree
so actually we didn't use that much of
the bag I still got this much sugar bag
full could have could have just bought
one of the little boxes of salt I just I
couldn't find the big thing of salt in
the grocery store kids were waiting in
the car so I just went with sugar and
got the crap out of there I'm sure
there's some super easy way to do this
and people are just watching the train
wreck I'll be like that copper tubes and
to live the season capping it and in
theory my copper tube is now bendable in
theory we have not tried this it would
have been a good idea to try this before
I spent an hour up a tree
alright Taryn you might need to help me
out with the lowering process here pull
it across the yard as we go
okay I'm dropping the backpack you ready
Oh Pat I almost hit the camera well it
moved where it was falling - that's what
I meant when I said Plinko do you not
have Plinko in America no oh all right
grab the copper tube
okay
we have a plan for this we're going to
head over to the neighbor's house since
it's not so early and we are going to
find out what the feasibility of our
block manufacturing is now I'm pretty
sure those cars there
am I not standing in the window is it
John on the other side of the door what
was that you exhaling okay ah you'll
have to return later so I just bought
the reservoir for my computer which came
prefilled although probably just going
to empty it anyways but I'll empty it
before I start building because I'll
probably drink it next time on scrapyard
wars Luke's budget is drying up because
that's all I have left I super
definitely can't afford it and Linus's
plans might be a wash I'm not sure if we
can still put a computer in here
