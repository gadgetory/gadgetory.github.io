Tomb Raider the new tomb Raider that has
the exact same title as the old Tomb
Raider welcome to our Tomb Raider
GPU showdown performance guide we are
gonna be taking four different price
points and comparing cards from the
green team and the red team and letting
you guys know which one is the best for
your hard-earned dollar in this
particular game new Tomb Raider
not old Tomb Raider now as always we're
gonna start with a look at our test
bench we have a 39 60 X at 4 gigahertz
so it's an its overclocked but quite
frankly a 3770k or 35 70 K is gonna
perform better than that once you
overclock it to the max anyhow 16 gigs
of Kingston HyperX memory in ASU's p 9 X
79 deluxe we obviously swap out the
graphics cards we've got an antique high
current Pro 1000 watt power supply 128
gig SSD for our boot drive and it's all
cooled by a corsair h 100 now since the
CPU is overclocked and because everyone
in their dog tests graphics cards at
their stock speeds we overclocked every
graphics card on our test bench because
we think you guys should be overclocking
your graphics cards too and we want to
represent what you will be able to
achieve with your card so we're going
for fairly realistic overclocks on our
cards and you can check out the
annotation if you want to see exactly
what settings we're running so you can
try and replicate them on your own cards
we are not using the built-in benchmark
for Tomb Raider we are actually using a
2-minute run through the same way that
we normally do and if you want to check
out our two-minute run-through you can
follow along with slicks testing
methodology video which he creates every
time we do one of these show downs and
you can benchmark your system against
ours now while we understand the
importance of rating graphics cards
based on frame times as opposed to just
frame rates we don't have the equipment
yet to do that so we're sticking with
our old methodology of using fraps to
record frame rates and reporting the
results it may not be perfect but it's
as good as anything anyone else has been
recording for the last 5 years anyway so
hopefully it still gives you some
guidance in terms of how these cards
compare to each other in our hundred
dollar price range we've got the 77 70
and the GTX 650 now these cards were run
at ultimate which is the same settings
we ran everything else at and if you
think about that for a moment a hundred
dollar card
400 dollar card the same settings is
quite possible you're going to end up
with a situation where it's not really
even playable on these cards the 77 70
in particular did not perform very well
on ultimate however because the both of
these cards just tanked with tress-fx on
we decided to run at Ultra instead of
ultimate just to give you guys a look at
what you might actually be playing at so
the only real difference between ultra
and ultimate is that ultra does not have
tress-fx which is the realistic hair
simulation that's going on in this game
the funny thing is tress-fx is an AMD
technology but it actually runs better
on the 650 than the 77 70
even though even though neither of them
are playable at all so let's move into
our next price bracket which is about
two hundred dollars so our six sixty is
about 29 and our seventy eight seventy
is about 239 making them sort of closer
to 250 but this is a very good value
price point and so that's why we want to
bring this up the 7870 did win by about
10 percent versus the 660 so there you
go I guess there's not really much else
to say because Tomb Raider benchmarked
very smoothly
other than the hiccups that were
encountered on the lower end we're on
the lower end cards where with tress-fx
it didn't seem to really want to work at
all 7950 continues to be a rockstar in
our testing in overclocks incredibly
well and particularly when it came to
minimum frame rates versus the 660ti it
performed about 50 percent better on
minimums 48 FPS versus 30 FPS on the
660ti so that was a bit of a trouncing
because remember guys minimum frame
rates are more important to the overall
gaming experience than average frame
rates necessarily can be in our final
price bracket so we've gone $100 $200
$300 and now $400 we've got the GTX 670
and the Radeon 7970 so it's not a
gigahertz Edition card but quite frankly
it doesn't really matter because it
doesn't over card yourself anyway but we
see another victory for the red team
this time again by about 10% and I guess
it makes sense because this is an AMD
sort of gaming involved title they are
giving it away with their cards in there
never
bundles or at least they have depending
on when you're watching this video and I
think that pretty much wraps it up so
