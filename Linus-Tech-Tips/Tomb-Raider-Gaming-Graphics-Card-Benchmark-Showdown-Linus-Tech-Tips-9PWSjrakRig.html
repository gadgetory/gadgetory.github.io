tomb raider the new tomb raider that has
the exact same title as the old tomb
raider welcome to our tomb raider GPU
showdown performance guide we are going
to be taking four different price points
and comparing cards from the green team
and the red team and letting you guys
know which one is the best for your hard
earned dollar in this particular game
new tomb raider not old tomb raider now
as always we're going to start with a
look at our test bench we have a 30 960
x @ 4 gigahertz so it's a it's
overclocked but quite frankly I've 3770k
or 3570k is going to perform better than
that once you overclock it to the max
anyhow 16 gigs of kingston hyperx memory
an asus p9x79 deluxe we obviously swap
out the graphics cards we've got an
antec high current pro 1000 watt power
supply 128 gig SSD for a boot drive and
it's all cooled by a corsair h100 now
since the cpu is overclocked and because
everyone in their dog tests graphics
cards at their stock speeds we overclock
every graphics card on our test bench
because we think you guys should be
overclocking your graphics cards too and
we want to represent what you will be
able to achieve with your card so we're
going for fairly realistic overclocks on
our cards and you can check out the
annotation if you want to see exactly
what settings we're running so you can
try and replicate them on your own cards
we are not using the built-in benchmark
for tomb raider we are actually using a
two-minute run through the same way that
we normally do and if you want to check
out our two-minute run-through you can
follow along with slicks testing
methodology video which he creates every
time we do one of these showdowns and
you can benchmark your system against
ours now while we understand the
importance of rating graphics cards
based on frame times as opposed to just
frame rates we don't have the equipment
yet to do that so we're sticking with
our old methodology of using fraps to
record frame rates and reporting the
results it may not be perfect but it's
as good as anything anyone else has been
recording for the last five years anyway
so hopefully it still gives you some
guidance in terms of how these cards
compare to each other in our hundred
dollar price range we've got the 7770
and the GTX 650 now these cards were run
at ultimate which is the same settings
we ran everything else at and if you
think about that for a moment $100 card
vs
$400 card the same settings is quite
possible you're going to end up with a
situation where it's not really even
playable on these cards the 7770 in
particular did not perform very well on
ultimate however because the both of
these cards just tanked with tressfx on
we decided to run at ultra instead of
ultimate just to give you guys a look at
what you might actually be playing at so
the only real difference between ultra
and ultimate is that ultra does not have
tressfx which is the realistic hair
simulation that's going on in this game
the funny thing is tressfx is an AMD
technology but it actually runs better
on the 650 than the 7770 even though
even though neither of them are playable
at all so let's move into our next price
bracket which is about two hundred
dollars so our 660 is about 29 and our
7870 is about 239 making them sort of
clean up closer to 250 but this is a
very good value price point and so
that's why we want to bring this up the
7870 did win by about ten percent versus
the 660 so there you go I guess there's
not really much else to say because Tomb
Raider benchmarked very smoothly other
than the hiccups that were encountered
on the lower end with on the lower end
cards where with tressfx it didn't seem
to really want to work at all 7950
continues to be a rock star in our
testing it overclocks incredibly well
and particularly when it came to minimum
frame rates versus the 660 ti it
performed about fifty percent better on
minimums 48 fps vs 30 FPS on the 660 ti
so that was a bit of a trouncing because
remember guys minimum frame rates are
more important to the overall gaming
experience than average frame rates
necessarily can be in our final price
bracket so we've gone a hundred dollars
two hundred dollars three hundred
dollars and now four hundred dollars
we've got the GTX 670 and the radeon
7970 so it's not a gigahertz edition
card but quite frankly it doesn't really
matter because it doesn't you can
overclock the card yourself anyway but
we see another victory for the red team
this time again by about ten percent and
I guess it makes sense because this is
an AMD sort of gaming involved title
they are giving it away with their cards
in there never
bundles or at least they have depending
on when you're watching this video and I
think that pretty much wraps it up so
