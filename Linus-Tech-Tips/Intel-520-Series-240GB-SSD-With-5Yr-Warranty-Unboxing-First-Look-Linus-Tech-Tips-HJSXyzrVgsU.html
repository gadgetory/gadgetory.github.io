series SSD
I know it's another SSD unboxing and
there's not much different because this
is a sand force base Drive and it's a
240 gig drive and these exist before but
wait no no this is an other more
different sound force Drive so while the
Intel 520 series drive has a sand force
save the three six gigabit per second
controller in it okay so let's just see
if there's anything else that has to say
for itself on the outside of the box
before we before we get into this okay
so we got the data manufacture which was
sort of not that long ago we got a
product code we've got a capacity comes
in a variety of capacities including 120
gig 240 gig oK we've got the box
contents which we'll see obviously
because this is an unboxing that means
we open the box
superfast hard drive alternative and
they're right rugged silent and solid
they're right about that - and in the
state of 6-game bit per second is SATA 3
gigabit per second compatible comes with
a five-year warranty
Intel actually includes a 5-year
warranty with their Sam force drive
which brings me to what is special about
an Intel Sam force state of 360 gigabit
per second drive and that is that well 1
why did it take them so long to get to
market I don't know if you guys remember
this but there was some there's quite a
bit of flack going around about
SandForce SATA 3 drives and not being
reliable enough and etc etc etcetera and
I'm gonna let you guys in on a little
secret
well my suspicion of a little secret
anyway I suspect that Intel was planning
a seven force drive ages ago but because
they were the ones whose internal
validation found that there were still
problems with it they never released one
until now so not only have they
addressed the reliability issues that
people were having with Sun force drives
which by and large are resolved with the
other manufacturers now as well okay so
let's let's assume for a second that the
reliability is equivalent which I don't
know is necessarily true because at
least at NCIX intel has the lowest
return rate out of all SSD manufacturers
like definitely the lowest although
they're more expensive so bear that in
mind as well
intel has also tuned the performance of
their sent for a SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second drive to the point where it is
now faster than anyone elses in spite of
the fact that it only uses synchronous
Intel flash it doesn't even use toggle
flash so without the advantage of the
fastest possible flash out there they're
achieving better performance than anyone
else so they have done reliability
tuning and performance tuning on this
controller in order to achieve the best
possible drive to deliver to their
customers so this is a replacement for
the 510 series drive that performs
better and I mean what else is there to
really say about it beyond that so here
we go let's have a look at the drive
itself you can see there's four screws
on the top that allow you to remove this
plastic piece right here allowing you to
install it in laptops that require a low
profile two and a half inch drive or
laptops that require a full height two
and a half inch drive you got all your
standard mounting holes on the bottom
you can see this equipment is provided
by the Intel demo depot cool okay ah you
got it sorry did I say you have two
mounting holes here and your mounting
holes here I really don't know why they
don't do something about like the finish
on these drives because they're all kind
of like this I wouldn't mind if they
were sort of a little shiny kingston
does a great job with the aesthetics of
their drives i don't know if it seems
kind of it's very rugged so it depends
what you're after I guess if you're
looking for something sort of rugged and
corporate then that works what do we
have for included accessories Intel is
one of the best when it comes to well
included accessories because they are
very I mean that's that's kind of their
thing it's like with an Intel product
that you buy you expect it to come with
everything you need you expect it to
work 100% right out of the box it's
their corporate expectation of
themselves and that customers have of
them so they include everything you need
here we have the Intel data migration
software can be downloaded from Intel
comm slash go slash SSD installation
that only works on Intel drives and it
actually does work I've used it in the
past it allows you to quickly and easily
transition your system from a hard drive
to an SSD comes with a SATA cable made
by Foxconn there you go Foxconn makes
everything it's amazing then we've got
five haha look at this I love it I love
it when companies do this five desk top
screws five like notebook screws
this allows you to install it in
whatever kind of configuration you
require so if you're using an adapter
then you'll use these screws to mount
the adapter into your case and you'll
use these screws to mount it to the
adapter but why do they include five
they include five just in case there's a
miscount so no matter what happens
you'll always have enough screws because
they include five so even if you're one
short you'll still have four which is
what you actually need you also get a
speed demon sticker if you also get an
Intel solid state drive important web
links thing you get a molex to SATA
adapter adapter cable and you get an
included two and a half inch to three
and a half inch drive sled which gives
you a lot of different flexibility more
flexible options in terms of where you
want to mount the drive on it maybe you
got like a hot swap cage or something
like that you're gonna put it in you
want to make sure everything lines up
right so there you go so you'll use
these screws to mount it to this and
these screws to mount this to your case
which has all the same mounting points
as a three and a half inch hard drive
and is one of the more rugged and robots
coming here I'll contrast this with what
comes with intel's competitors drives I
think I have one lying around over here
so I'm not gonna need any names but this
one's made of aluminum and like look how
much flex it has which I'm not saying
actually matters or anything but you
know if you're gonna be Intel and over
build everything you might as well over
build everything so there you have it
this is the Intel 520 series SSD and the
reason I have this is I'm actually going
to be doing a 240 to 256 gig SSD round
up on my NCIX comm channel so make sure
you're subscribed to that one as well
because we're gonna have a look at this
one a couple other sand force drives
we're gonna have a look at and in the
links Everest Drive and finally the
crucial m4 and see how they all stack up
