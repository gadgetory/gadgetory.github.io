the msi radeon 7850 power addition
remember power Edition cards feature
enhanced thermal performance with twin
frozer coolers this one has the Twin
Frozr 4 and triple over voltage enhanced
pwm design so what does it enhance pwm
did I mean basically better voltage
regulation for the memory as well as the
GPU poor and full support for triple
over voltage so triple over voltage
basically amounts to being able to
overbill the GPU the PLL and the memory
through MSI Afterburner software so
we've got a mini DisplayPort to full
sized display card adapter included DVI
to VGA adapter included some useless
discs and manuals and if you really need
to go how to install a graphics card at
this point and I have a video about that
so don't worry too much about the paper
manual that comes with your graphics
card you've got a dual molex to 6-pin
PCI II connector because this is a 7850
so you only need one of them it's a very
small very compact card and so you can
quite plainly tell that MSI has done up
there oh yeah yeah see the PCI bracket
punctured the bag so I couldn't get it
up
so MSI has done completely their own
custom PCB in order to build a beefier
PWM as well as just generally a better
board for more overclocking goodness so
this is more of a value oriented card
this is like value gaming not not like
value cards so you're still gonna get
dramatically better performance than
you'd get with any kind of an on board
or like you know ghetto low-end card
solution but you're not going to pay a
boatload for it and the great thing
about their power addition cards is that
while they do cost a little bit more
than reference cards it's not that much
considering the extra benefit so you got
the Twin Frozr for cooler which
basically means on this particular
version this is a swap munis is a
low-power chip and everything you've got
three heat pipes that are fanning out to
sort of a radiator style
a toque has a better angle radiator
style of the minim fins that cover the
entire length and width of the PCB very
very nice very good cooling you've also
got check this out so this piece right
here is actually fully attached to here
I'm gonna try and get you guys look at
angle can you see in there can you see
the full Yuna sink that's covering the
entire card so that gives this card a
lot of rigidity like check this out
there's no flex to it it gives it okay
well okay there is if I grab the cooler
but if you actually take the PCB
compared to a regular card
it's very bridges it's very strong so
you have the cooling benefit of having a
heatsink over the all the RAM chips and
PWM and then you've also got the benefit
of once you install it in the part it's
not gonna sag like a lot of cards to
because they have that flex so I really
like that about this particular design
that we've seen on some of MSI's recent
cards the Twin Frozr 4 has a lot of
different things going for it so it's
got heat pipes it's got duel fans it's
got propeller blades which basically
amount to more airflow and they will
spin in Reverse at the beginning this is
the feature of the Twin Frozr for in
order to remove dust from the fins
before turning around and spinning the
other way to actually cool the card so
you'll notice when you first boot it up
it's quite loud but that's normal it's
trying to blow all the dust out of it
before it actually starts cooling the
carb this will mean that you won't have
to clean this card out as often as you
would with a normal one I also love the
look of their twin frozer cards so
they've got like you know MSI sort of
silver black thing going on usually a
little colour accent thing like that
looks really really sharp okay terms of
overall features of the board so it's a
little slower than a 78 70 but given the
difference in prices definitely
justifiable it also only uses a single
PCIe a 6-pin PCI power connector so
that's a six pin right there not even in
Aitkin it has full support for Eyefinity
so it supports up to four displays
you've got two mini display ports on
this card HDMI and DVI out so actually I
think it in theory supports more than
that if you daisy chain additional
displays but let's go ahead and say for
at least for now in fact let's look at
what MSI has to say about the cards so
you got aimed at finiti HD 3d which
we've tried and
we've got 4k support which is actually
really cool so you can drive a 4k
display off this card that's new with
the 7000 generation of cards deep color
and 3 gigahertz K Dolby TrueHD you play
power play Parton ah yes 28 nanometer
process technologies this is an
extremely powerful card and performance
and overclocking are outstanding given
the prices that you're looking at is
also fully PCI Express 3.0 compliant
which for a card like this is not going
to amount to any kind of a performance
Delta but I mean there you have it you
have a PCI u3 board and you really want
a PCIe 3 card you can put this in it
you've also got full support for AMD
crossfire it's two-way only not 3-way so
bear that in mind there's only one
crossfire instead of crossfire fingers
up at the top and I think that pretty
much covers it thank you for checking
