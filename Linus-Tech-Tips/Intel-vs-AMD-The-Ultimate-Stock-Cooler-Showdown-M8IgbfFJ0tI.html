there's loads of references you can
check out for performance breakdowns and
stuff like that in order to determine
which one is better but no one ever
really compares the difference in their
stock coolers so if you have an option
between coolers which should you choose
let's find out also stay subscribed for
other seemingly random videos from Linus
tech tips
save on Intel 730 series SSDs during
Intel's president week sale February
22nd to March 1st 2015 click to learn
more now so we started by sourcing the
stock coolers I acquired three offerings
from AMD a standard cooler with a copper
slug in the middle a standard cooler
without a copper slug in the middle and
a heat pipe based cooler with a larger
copper base from Intel I actually only
have one cooler it's their little one
that they've been shipping for quite
some time which also sports a copper
slug in the middle for platforms I'll be
using a stock AMD a10 6800 K and a 4790k
I'll be testing each CPU cooler on both
CPUs so the mounting is going to get a
little bit ghetto here and there not
super designed to go on each platform so
there might even be some modifications
going on to fit AMD CPUs onto the Intel
platform all I really had to do was
create to zap strap loops and fed them
through the motherboard through the
existing holes and while this wasn't
exactly elegant I actually didn't really
interfere with the cooler all that much
and it was relatively easy to do if you
were to do this on your own I would
highly recommend a proper base and using
the mounting hardware from maybe a
different cooler and modifying it to
your needs the Intel cooler was in
different beast entirely due to the clip
like feet these feet stop the cooler
from being able to make a connection
with the CPU as they stood off from the
motherboard therefore they were removed
in the name of science the intel heat
sinks fan clips on using the longer
parts of its leg which is an issue but
thankfully the base of the actual metal
where the copper slug is it's actually
taller than the rest of the unit so the
first thing I removed was the fan
mounting hardware and the fan itself
from the heatsink to of the mounting
legs had additional clips for attaching
to the heatsink and to didn't I
completely cut off the ones that didn't
have any additional clip and the other
ones I removed the mounting legs really
quickly and then shave them down as
short as they could go while still
having the clip attached and still being
strong enough to hold on from there it
was essentially the same as the AMD
coolers in terms of mounting to the
motherboard so all the coolers are
strapped in literally and we're ready to
go the benchmark will use is i-264
stability test which will which we have
set up to test the CPU FPU cache and
system memory this test will be ran for
at
ten minutes or longer depending on if
the system seems to have hit a constant
temperature or not and each cooler and
CPU will be wiped clean with 99%
isopropyl alcohol and toilet paper
before every test I'm using icy diamond
thermal compound to remove variables as
I would only be able to use the stock
thermal paste on these coolers once
which makes it generally useless the
results were rather expected bigger
cooler does better and when size is
similar the ones with copper slugs
outperform those without and the bigger
cooler with the most copper in it and
the one that also happened to have heat
pipes did the best overall one thing to
note is that the goal of this video is
to compare the available stock cooling
solutions not which CPU has better
thermal output that's a different story
for another time in conclusion the
coolers are kind of made for what
platform they're going on but if you
have an option between an AMD and Intel
CPU cooler regardless of your CPU you
should probably grab the AMD one either
solution will definitely get the job
done if you're just running at stock but
if you have the option you might as well
take it this does draw upon another
question however which I would love to
dive into if you guys are interested is
aftermarket cooling worth it for price
per performance in early 2015 and if so
how much should you really invest let me
know if this is something you're
interested over on the forum while
you're there click the support us box
link thing in the top right hand corner
and change your Amazon links to ours
that'll help us out a lot especially
with the weird YouTube changes that are
going on lately you you can become a
contributor to the forum there is some
cool stuff coming for those guys soon
and if you're tired of the forum and
don't want to be over there because
you're done commenting back on YouTube
subscribe like dislike do all those
things based on which cooler you like
more I'm not going to tell you which
option to choose depending on that but
you'll figure it out anyways guys thanks
for watching I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
