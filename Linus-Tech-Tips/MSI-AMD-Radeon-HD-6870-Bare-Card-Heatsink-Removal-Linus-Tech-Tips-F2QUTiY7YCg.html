heatsink
glory so you can clearly see the GPU
right here in the middle of the part
surrounded by eight memory chips all
right we've got not a whole lot of major
heat producing components which should
be quite obvious from the design of the
heatsink because you can see it only
makes contact with the card here for the
RAM here for the RAM here for some
voltage regulation and then here for the
GPU itself we've got three heat pipes on
this copper hunk that looks actually
just like a copper base and aluminium
fins we've got some additional heat
sinks right here above the vrm so you
can see that's directly over top of
where this thermal strip is making
contact there you can see this thin the
heat pipe arrangement actually moves
freely within the shroud so what that
means is it's actually being bolted on
separately by these four so you can see
those ponies will actually move that
piece and then the rest of the assembly
where this is a large heatsink so this
piece is metal and this piece is plastic
so this is all one big heat sink is all
attached separately so that's by the
screws which are here here here here
here this is kind of neat the way
they've done the shroud here as you know
the back of this GPU only has about a
quarter well half of one slot for
exhaust so the way they've shaped the
plastic shroud here is that the airflow
goes from the fan here through my rain
Sun comes through comes through these
fins and then ultimately it gets
redirected by this wavy piece of plastic
so that it all goes out the one side so
there you are that's my in-depth look at
the cooler of the 5870 there's the four
pin pwm fan connector that I better make
sure and forget to put on when I
reinstall this maybe we can look a
little bit more closely at the card I'm
not sure what else to really tell you
about it I'm not an electrical engineer
so I can't really give you too many
details about what everything is on here
I can tell you this card is very
waterblock unfriendly though just the
positioning of these guys in here and
how high these are means you're gonna
have to waste a lot of copper to make a
block for this because it have to be
quite thick to get over those or I guess
you can put such a thin strip though
like you could you could put a gap so
that the whole thing sits over top of
that but yeah I don't I'll be interested
to see what guys like ek come up with
because it'll probably be mostly them my
heat killer who bothered to come out
with blocks for like a mid-range
performance card typically we only see
full cover blocks for the really high
end cards it would be really easy to to
water pool this card with a GPU block
that will cuz you just throw a GPU block
on here throw a tram sinks on and then
basically find some way to cool this
like chop up some heat sinks or
something but like a nice beefy thing on
there as long as you find something thin
and tall should be pretty good so there
you have it
