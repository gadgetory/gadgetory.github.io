about a microphone incidentally it was
actually the predecessor to this one the
SL 300 we've received a lot of requests
to cover this category better in it
first this was confusing to me why when
I was a kid building a hot rod PC the
microphone was the last thing on
anyone's mind but of course that was
before services like twitch TV existed
and for that matter before YouTube
existed and suddenly you know everyone
and their dog all of a sudden figures
they need a broadcast grade microphone
to ramble into while playing video games
but of course that shift has occurred
now and my recent appearance on pimped
my setup which you can check out here by
the way really drove home for me how
many of these just perfectly normal
people have high-end microphones as part
of their rigs and why these reviews are
so popular so without further ado here's
our video of the SL 600 condenser
microphone from editors keys
Corsairs h ati GT in h 100 GTX
all-in-one liquid coolers improve both
the appearance and cooling of your PC
click my face
to learn more right out of the box the
SL 600 feels more professional-grade
than consumer grade and actually mean
that in kind of a negative sense it
includes a hard case for travel you know
because everyone needs one of those and
a reasonably competent if not
exceptional shock mount okay that one's
actually pretty handy and guys like blue
and razer charge extra for that on
similarly priced consumer slash prosumer
oriented mics like the yeti pro and
siren and they had the sense to include
a nice long USB cable but it doesn't
include any kind of stand for the darn
thing this is what professional gear is
always like you know here's the hard
stuff to find but we'll just assume you
already have like a thing to actually
put it on your freaking desk or
something more elaborate like a boom arm
that clamps to it to hold the thing up
and and I didn't I mean it's not a huge
deal in editors keys does have a
reasonably priced stand accessories if
you don't have your own already but the
bad news is that could put the SL 600
beyond the you know oh it's only a
little bit more than the siren threshold
where folks are likely to upsell
themselves a few bucks for something
that is significantly better if they
don't already own one but is it
significantly better patience we'll get
to that first the physical tour the SL
600 has a striking and to me very
appealing but I'm kind of partial to
this color scheme appearance with a
black metal body and orange mesh over
the single large 34 millimetre diaphragm
yes folks this is not a
jack-of-all-trades microphone so if you
were expecting to get XLR output and
veritable smorgasbord of pickup patterns
that are pretty unlikely to be used
outside of very specific situations
you'll be sorely disappointed the SL 600
is designed to be used one way and one
way only speak into the microphone below
the business end is a low-cut switch to
get rid of the boo meanness that can
sometimes occur when someone other than
me sits too close at minus 10 decibel
pre attenuation switch for loud sources
a gain knob and
what's this the big upgrade that got my
attention on this model compared to the
SL 300 which I use just about every
other day a headphone nob to go along
with the zero latency audio monitoring
port just under the dial very nice just
like the other microphones that I'm
comparing against it can output only
your computer systems sound from that
port or it can mix in the microphones
input with zero delay making it perfect
for podcasting or does it now we'll get
into the actual audio quality I'll be
putting it up against the two similarly
priced products that I have in my
testing stable right now in my usual
scenarios let's start with some test
audio from the SL 600 in my ideal
scenario where it's positioned directly
in front of me between my keyboard and
face with a dual layer pop filter in
this position the SL 600 performs very
well ambient noise pickup is among the
lowest I've encountered so in spite of
the four other computers in the room and
the nearby server room and even with the
keyboard rocking out in the background
behind it which I'll start mashing away
on now voice quality is very very good I
mean if you're a game streamer this can
be the difference between an acceptable
microphone and one that's totally
useless which was my biggest complaint
about the Razer siren from my Yeti
blackout and pro review the sound of my
voice through the siren was a strong
point for it but it's high noise floor
and inability to shut out background
noise like typing like this hurts it in
a big way when it's commanding a big
league price similar to the other
microphones we're looking at today the
next of which is the blue yeti pro which
holds up really well against the
competition it's noise floor is similar
and it's ambient noise pick up both the
hum of the computer systems and typing
away behind the mic is noticeably better
than the SLE 600 but both Brandon and I
in side-by-side listening tests pegged
the SLE 600 as the more natural sounding
of the two and therefore probably my
pick for vocal recording with the yeti
pro having a more radio like sound
quality at this distance something that
many broadcasters will prefer which got
me thinking how would the SL 600 perform
in a more up close and personal
recording environment the answer is
you're listening to it you get a much
warmer sound with more bass but without
it becoming overwhelming that same
experiment on the yeti pro didn't give
me nearly as dramatic a difference in
the recording though so for skilled
broadcasters who want to leverage the
different ways that they'll sound as
they move closer or further from the
microphone the SL 600 is a clear winner
for me which leads us to our next test
scenario starting with the SL 600
putting the mic off to the side next to
the monitor where it's forced to operate
from a distance of about half a meter
from the sound source this is definitely
not the SL 600 wheelhouse it sounds
noticeably more distant than the blue
yeti pro which I'll switch to now for
easy side-by-side comparison although as
usual I have standardized test
recordings which you can find in my
SoundCloud linked below the video but
I'd still take it over the razor siren
which I'm switching to now due to the
sirens noise floor and background noise
pickup which continue to be the bane of
its existence is this thing on all right
so let's talk final thoughts then once
you get to a certain point it looks like
four USB desktop microphones that's
about $200 it becomes more about
trade-offs than one product being
clearly significantly better than
another the SL 600 would be my choice
for pure vocals or broadcasting thanks
to its voice recording prowess and the
lifetime warranty is a definite plus
but the Yeti pros XLR output Hardware
mute button it's a big one and ambient
noise reduction make it a clear choice
for game streamers at the same price
once you factor in that you're going to
need a stand for this bad boy speaking
of streaming and that game streamers
xsplit broadcaster powers countless live
streams and recordings around the world
including the land show that you see
here on Linus tech tips every Friday
their new v2 version of the software has
powerful new tools it's built to meet
the needs of today's content creators
and all these bullet points that I'm
supposed to say but the basic point of
all of this is that xsplit is affordable
and just plain works it's stable their
game detection is outstanding so it can
actually pick up on games Luke's had it
running with games that aren't even
released yet and it's just like Boop
yeah
we know about this we'll let you go
ahead and cast that which helps the
games not be as demanding on your system
when you're streaming them as well as
just generally being easier to use you
can set up a variety of scenes you got
fade effects as you switch between them
and it's got all kinds of stuff that
really just generally makes the life of
me personally and I'm assuming anyone
else who tries it a little bit easier
the best part is that if you're willing
to give up on a couple of the more
premium features like lots of extra
scenes it is completely free there's
also some stuff I should mention about
xsplit gamecaster so that's for gamers
to easily stream and record their great
gaming moments at the click of a button
it's got an easy-to-use overlay so you
can go ahead and bring that up and start
you know streaming or recording your
gameplay without actually all tabbing
completely out of the game and I think
those are pretty redundant I've got
another point that says it's great for
creating live streams and recordings
yeah yeah it would be I mean anything
split media makes it pretty much is for
that
so visit xsplit comm slash Linus to
start streaming and recording in HD
today guys thanks for watching like this
video if you like to dislike it if you
thought it sucked leave a comment if
your feelings are more complicated than
either of those if you actually want to
leave a comment we've got a link in the
video description to where you can do
that on the Linus tech tips forum you
can log in to facebook steam I believe
Twitter login is allowed so you don't
even have to go through a whole content
got a profile creation process also
