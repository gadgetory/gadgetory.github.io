today so first of all we cross the six
million subscriber threshold and
whatever it might say in the in the
thumbnail there every single one of you
matters we we owe everything to our
subscribers the fact that we get to do
this cool job the fact that we get to
make content every day like just it's
it's absolutely incredible you guys are
utterly amazing so I'm gonna get to what
I meant with the thumbnail in a moment
but then there are actually a couple of
other really exciting things that happen
today that blew my mind so YouTube's
own stats are usually delayed by about a
day sometimes there's some glitchyness
so I'm gonna use a third-party platform
here social blade but lioness tech tips
also had its most views ever in a single
month at sixty eight point eight four
million and its most subscribers in a
single month at two hundred and sixty
seven thousand so wrap your brain around
those numbers for a minute if we were
doing a quarter million subs a month
every month Linus tech tips could have
reached six million subs in in two years
like it's absolutely incredible how
people are finding Linus tech tips and
getting subscribed to it because I've
got some I've got some algorithm stuff
to chat about with you guys because we
discovered something really really
interesting about maybe not some of the
changes that Google is making to the
algorithm lately because you guys might
know about all that stuff already things
like changing the subscription feed to
not necessarily be chronological we're
not going to get into exactly what
they've changed because I'll be being
100% honest with you guys I'm actually
not a huge consumer of YouTube content
and so I usually find out from
like a third-party source when something
changes about you know subscriber feeds
or homepage or whatever else and I'm
like oh okay I guess that's interesting
but it's just something that we observed
with one of our videos recently anyway
before I do that what I wanted to do
because people are always congratulating
Linus whenever we reach a subscriber
threshold or whenever we you know have a
video with a lot of views I get a lot of
emails in my inbox so I just wanted to
run around our office and not
everybody's here right now but I wanted
you guys to have an opportunity to meet
every person behind the scenes here to
the best that I can
they're not all here and just you know
they've got 10 seconds to describe what
they do here because as much as people
might think that YouTube's not a real
job or that what we do is easy because
we just you know record videos and then
post them online or whatever there is a
ton of work that goes into everything so
first up is laser James I had nothing to
do with this
you have been here over a year now you
had plenty to do with it yeah so my job
has become a mini expert on a ton of
different stuff very fast so it sounds
like we know what we're talking about
for your Maps that's a great summary
actually Jake what do you do here videos
cool he does other stuff too then we've
got Anthony our resident iMac Pro
destroyer potentially fixer let's see
what happens here so yes Anthony is
another one of our writers he does a lot
of our very highly IT technical content
whereas James is more focused on
consumer electronics and then alex is
sort of a crossover tech slash like
maker guy ya know we're like really
Jackie projects and laptops are me
mostly yeah actually that's true he does
the vast majority of our laptop stuff
edie what do you do here can you get
back to work please
that actually is legitimately his job he
did a thing on like our workflow a
little while ago he hosted it I actually
did a surprisingly good job of it and
his job is really to babysit me and tell
us to get back to work what do you do
here my dear redesign sets I do
accounting I do hiring I don't know what
else I thought you were I thought you're
serious you said you resign that's good
Janice do you want to say hi
I got me here and that's it's an
important job all right you're gonna
takes a little while to get around the
office these days all the people over
here are you guys are pretty I think
Nick's been with us a long time Nick
what the heck do you do all day
literally nothing go away no no you're
gonna tell them you gotta tell them the
six million subscribers dream there's
confidential information on my screen
please turn it away I make him do the
things and make sure that there are
videos essentially so Nick is sort of
like a general manager he officially got
like CEO Oh in his title I think last
year yeah yeah so his job is kind of
anytime I'm not around you know he and
Yvonne are running the show and you know
I I will question a decision made by
them but I will not overrule a decision
made by them over the normal course of
our business so he's he's got a lot of
responsibility around here Colton what
do you do what do I do
not general super fun anymore yeah
that's true
I do business management and all that
fun stuff dude all the stuff you love
finding LTX planning LTX hosting a
little bit of hosting tech became the
host another tech work you soon that'll
be dope all right cheating on cheating
game cheat what a tech quickie on games
yeah oh it's actually pretty good a lot
of people who watch our content have no
idea
how many people it takes to keep this
ship tickin hey Brandon its million
subscriber stream you're telling people
what you do here what I can't hear you
everybody's making this joke everyone's
trying to ignore me I actually could not
hear what you're saying I'm using 6
million subscribers stream what do you
do here Oh God
clearly nothing no no I I light and
shoot everything that you guys watch
yeah pretty much pretty much every well
like 90% of what you see is probably
been touched by me in some way uh-huh
all right let's see if let's see if
Tyler's around there are some I mean a
lot of the people you guys are seeing
get a fair bit of screen time but some
of them are really unsung heroes hey
Tyler are you around well he's not here
right now but this is his desk
Tyler manages the warehouse chaos and
makes sure that it's not actually too
chaotic and we can find things when
people win prizes and giveaways he makes
sure that they arrive where they're
supposed to go he does receiving for all
the new items that come through our door
he's even done some writing and some
support work for video projects in the
past over over the last couple of years
he's become an invaluable member of our
team yeah there you heard Brendon
Tyler's a superhero there's so many
things that you know he never gets
credit on camera but that he has that he
plays a role in it's a six million
subscribers stream you're live what do
you do here I pack batteries that's what
you're doing right now but I okay dennis
is one of those ones where he gets a lot
of screen time but a lot of people
actually don't know why we employ so
many things I do tech quickie I do
Technic and translation team yeah and I
hang out and Darren what do you do here
I don't know man I edit all of the
videos it feels like Terrans also been
in charge of to a very significant
degree of improving our quality control
over the last couple of years so you
guys used to notice a lot I think
with only audio in one channel or like
blatant errors and the transitions that
the problem was that we had good editors
but those good editors didn't have
enough time so now we have good editors
and we have processes it's the golden
rule for all videos watch the video that
you've exported after you've exported it
and before you put it up that's the rule
that helps a lot out Riley hi well I'm
working at you typing you actually had
really nothing to do with this journey
to six million subscribers no I'd like
to think that I really supported you
mentally though he would always message
me and say Riley I've got so many
problems how do I fix them how do I
build a YouTube empire I was like it's
simple just call it name it after
yourself and then Wow you know what I'm
a prime do you want to be on the six
million stream what do you do here I
added videos and I'm the mean Lord
apparently yeah if you've okay yet why
don't you explain no I know
if you've seen a video that's to me me
he might have had he might have had he
might have had a hand in it might have
had handed it I don't think I'm gonna
find anybody in here
so I think the last one is that I had
wanted to find Tyler but I don't know
where he went off to just trying to
think if there's any part of the office
that I missed here um hope ya pehle is
not here but he's I think traveling
somewhere or something like that yeah I
think we actually we actually did
reasonably well Luke's not here but he
doesn't actually work here anymore he
works in floatplanes office which is
across the tape line in that other room
okay so now I'm going to get to the part
of this video that I teased oh yeah I've
been starting today either I'm gonna get
to the part of this video that I teased
at the beginning and that was the whole
like I'm not gonna call it clickbait cuz
it's not I have a point but it's cliquey
I'm gonna get to the clicky aspect of
this video title is
yeah kind of 31,000 people are waiting
for me too I have my computer right now
thank you alright so that was just a
really short summary like there's so
much stuff that goes on around here like
you know creating you know checklists
like this and processes and procedures
you know like closing up the building
you know all that kind of stuff it
really does take a lot more than people
would think to run to run a studio
that's on our scale because you might
not think about this but six regular LTT
videos a week sometimes seven if we
throw like a sponsored one in on the
Friday slot that's normally when show
plus when show so that's seven to eight
plus a couple tech quickies that means
we're doing 10 to 11 videos a week plus
tech linked so that here's 13 to 14
videos a week it is not insignificant
all right so let's get to my discovery
why I would say that the six million
subscribers don't matter okay earlier
this week we'll start the phone earlier
this week we uploaded a video called
nest cams are a big ripoff and what
happened was we got a ton of messages
through YouTube comments on Twitter
messages on the forum just all over the
place
we even got other we even got other tech
publications contacting us for comment
because as far as everyone could tell
this was the first like real verifiable
documented case of YouTube just not
delivering a video from a major channel
into people's subscription feeds and
this was coming right on the tails of
the revelation that YouTube had changed
the subscription feed to show videos out
of order and we were you know
understandably upset because that video
at around seven hundred and eighty-three
thousand views
performed about I'd say about ten to
twenty percent worse than I would have
expected given a number of factors given
the title given this topic given the
thumbnail and given the overall channel
momentum at that time because that
really is more of a factor than I think
a lot of people realize how much of a
high your channel is on effects how much
of a high you stay on and vice versa
then what happened is Jake whose video
that actually was he was the one who did
all the the janky 3d printing of the the
cool DIY security camera realized that
if you dug into the Advanced Settings on
that video for some reason here we go I
mean you guys are probably reading this
backwards I guess but I'll read it to
publish to subscriptions feed and notify
subscribers was not checked now we still
don't know who who clicked that but
someone must have because that's not an
option that's enabled by default and
there are a number of people who have a
hand in publishing a video so the editor
usually uploads it the writer usually
like checks it and fills in all the
information and then either them or
someone else might set it live so anyone
could have done it and everyone's like
oh not me not me not me not me
but what was really interesting about
this was how well the video performed
now I did just say that it was I'd say
10 to 20 percent worse than what I might
have expected for that video but I mean
10 to 20 percent of 800,000 is like
eighty to a hundred and fifty thousand
we have 6 million subscribers as of
today so a few days ago it was 5.9
something 6 million subscribers amounts
to only at the at best a hundred and
fifty thousand views on a video are you
kidding me
ah so check this out if we go into a
normal video that was published around
the same time so 12 kilometer Wi-Fi
we're gonna go into the video stats for
that guy and we're gonna punch down into
our views and then I'm gonna show you
guys the subscription status data here
this is really cool
so about 73% of the views here were from
people who were subscribed and 27% are
from people who are not subscribed over
time that ratio is gonna shift a little
bit because right when you publish a
video it would make sense that it's more
of your subscribers watching and less of
people who are who are stumbling across
it thanks to the algorithm alright now
remember those numbers what was it 73
and 27 like that okay now let's go to
the video that never made it into the
subscription feed dun dun da check this
out seventy thirty seventy thirty it
never made it to the subscription feed
so I mean I actually just found this out
a little while ago like I was started
really digging into these numbers so I
haven't put together like some kind of
conclusion as to what all of it means
I'll leave that to game theorist or
something like that but what it does
show me is that if YouTube is tooling
around with the algorithm whatever
they're doing seems to work nearly as
well or maybe nearly as well as someone
manually subscribing because they
managed to deliver almost like within
it's verifiable now that we can look at
the ratio they managed to deliver almost
as many of our subscribers that video as
they would have if the video was in the
subscription feed
so uh there that is finally what
prompted this video we've got six
million subscribers thank you so much
every single one of you it means a lot
to us but it's more of like an emotional
meaning because YouTube is changing or
Google
Google is changing the way that the
subscription model works so much that it
just doesn't seem to actually be that
important to the success of a channel
like it's nice to have the jump start
because that might prompt the algorithm
to pick something up better but
something we've noticed over on tech
linked is that the videos with my face
in them in the thumbnail are tending to
get more views but the ones that Riley
hosts actually have better retention so
why is is Google using like facial
recognition to tickle oh well this one's
hosted by Linus maybe we should like
push it to people who are interested in
lights or even not hosted by like you
know a lot of youtubers put celebrity
faces in their thumbnails when they're
reporting on a story about them or
whatever the case may be it may be maybe
that's a factor in how Google propagates
the content but one thing we know is
that if it was purely based on watch
time which is what Google has said is a
huge priority for them then surely
better retention stats would be a key
component to that right and yet it feeds
more of these to other people now we
haven't checked the click rates you know
maybe more people just click on it
because they recognize me versus Riley
but there's there's clearly a lot more
investigation to be done and by the time
we could possibly finish it I'm sure
Google will have completely changed it
all over again so thank you guys very
much for being part of this amazing ride
and we will see you again at ten million
with a diamond play button to be awesome
I am so excited I don't know how to end
this stream how do I end it okay I can
mute the microphone I
