CES 2016 this year check out their link
in the video description down below here
at fantex we're checking out the Eclipse
p400 this is a pretty affordable case
it's at $69 and it features a ton of
stuff I don't really think you normally
see at a $69 price point so it's all
steel construction it has a basement as
an RGB controller there's rubber
grommets it has SSD mounts on the back
of the motherboard tray not things
you're used to seeing
by default the RGB controller which is
kind of tucked away under the front of
the top of the bezel of the case is able
to control the RGB miss of the ring
around the power button and then under
glow on the front of the case and then
you can add LED strips to it if you want
to add more stuff and then it can
control all those as well the rest of
the outside of the case is pretty
self-explanatory on the top you've got
two USB 3.0 plugs headphone and
microphone jacks as well the left side
has a large window cutout and then the
right sides relatively plain the panel's
do have thumb screws that hang on them
when you try to remove it which is great
I love those fantastic and then we move
on to the inside there's that basement
that I talked about earlier which is
kind of a grill style basement so you
can see through it a bit but it's still
a cool looking kind of basement setup
there's a panel near the front where you
can remove that and then remove the hard
drive bays that are under it and extend
your radiator support from a 240 or 280
to 300 and sixty millimeter radiators so
you can pack a lot of cooling in here as
well speaking of cooling you can install
two fans up in the top either 120 or 140
millimeter fans and one 120 millimeter
fan in the back it also includes two
fans one in the back and one in the
front to keep gunk out of your case you
got a bunch of filters at the top
there's a long magnetic filter
protecting your top area the power
supply has a removable filter on rails
and then the front of the case for the
front intakes at the top and bottom of
the front panel there's two little
filter slighty rail things in terms of
cable management you've got cutouts
along the bottom and the top for your
headers or your CPU power whatever you
need there and then the right-hand side
has rubber grommets then moving to the
back of the case you've got some velcro
straps for your main channel of cables
and wires which is fantastic and then
you also see your two two and a half
inch SSD trays on the back of the
the board and then that hard drive Bay
in the bottom left-hand corner that we
previously talked about with 2/3 a half
inch hard drive bays trays it's fine if
you're more into quiet they also have
the p400s or the silent Edition this has
covers on the top blocking those fan
slots if you do want to install fans
there it also comes with dust filters
which are individual so you can have one
of the covers installed or both of the
covers installed whatever you want
it also has sound dampening material on
the inside on the inside of the panel
you can decide whether or not you want a
window if you go with no window the
panel is all sound Anthony material if
you don't it just goes around the window
it also has a three speed fan controller
which can control up to six fans alright
guys let me know in the comments down
below what you think I think this is a
pretty aggressive price point but that's
ultimately up to you again this is in
USD just in case you're confused about
the pricing it's like 687 Canadian
dollars I think I don't know at this
point we'll see how the dollar goes
thanks for watching guys by the way
thank you to Squarespace for bringing us

website for whatever reason I don't know
if you're going to like individually
sleeve cables and you want to make a
store or something they have a commerce
module so you can sell stuff on there as
well they have templates so if you're
really bad at aesthetic things they can
just kind of handle that for you which
is great if you're also really bad at
