shiniest motherboard box out of their
updated packaging you can see that the
890 fxa were doing the lettering rather
is actually like sparkly very cool
anyway this is the 890 FX AGD 70
motherboard it is the replacement for
the very popular 790 FX gd7 T so the a
means that it has support for a USB 3.0
as well as SATA 3 or SATA 6 gigabits per
second you can see that down here it
still features their OC Genie easy
overclocking technology along with
kor√≥n clocking and support for 6 core
CPUs out of the box so that means you've
got full support for a muse phantom 2 X
6 over here we've got everything else so
oh yeah this is a the first time I've
seen this on their motherboards but
they've been doing this on video cards
for a couple generations now military
class so that means they are using top
components has military quality whatever
so basically that means that they're
using only military grade components so
high C CAP eight times longer lifespan
they're using IC Cho 20 C lower
temperatures and then all solid caps for
10-years ultra long life time
basically what they're going for is the
best possible stability and longevity
with this motherboard everything there
we've already covered it has dr. Moss
and MSI's claim and I haven't seen
anything to disprove this is that one
phase of dr. Moss is greater than or
equal to four standard phases of MOSFETs
so they switch very fast they are I just
did it again
oh yeah basically dr. Moss is really
good that's what they say
Vladdy eight pipe that's radiating
solution oh okay so basically it keeps
the heat pipe nice and low profile as it
comes along the motherboard okay let's
get this opened up have a quick look at
the accessories and then have a look at
the eight ninety F XA GD 70 here is our
quick guide I love these MSI quick
guides they give you a full sized
actually it looks a little bit larger
than life model of the motherboard and
then labels everything for you to make
life really easy and then there's a more
marketing on the back thank you alright
then for other included
Suri's we have a drivers and utilities
DVD don't install this download the
latest off the msi website here is a
little user guide on their hard drive
back up solution great we got a quick
installation guide which is kind of like
that other thing except more detailed so
it shows you how to install your cpu ram
drives front panel connectors power set
up the bios all that good stuff next we
have the BIOS code unlock technology so
a quick guide on how to use their core
unlocking utility very nice then their
control center for overclocking oh
there's a little user guide for that
very nice all color look at that all in
English Wow
recommended CPU coolers for overclocking
hmm ok these are some interesting I hope
they're going somewhere with that I
don't have time to read it though next
we've got the user's guide which is not
all in English it contains a number of
different languages and lots of details
about yep we have an i/o shield we have
a fairly complete accessory package
overall so we've got four SATA cables
two molex to SATA adapters one IDE cable
then we have two USB 2.0 back panel
connectors by a next one of those
headers oh here's a bit of a end
connector I was gonna say it's kind of
like a cute connector but em ok there
you go so this has a way for you to plug
in all of your fun panel stuff and then
plug the whole thing in as a brick to
the motherboard very neat then we have a
crossfire bridge so this motherboard
being a an AMD chips that motherboard
890 FX chip set is not SLI compatible
however this is probably the coolest
thing about this motherboard and so I'm
gonna skip the usual stuff that I show
you right away I'm gonna show you this
right off the bat this motherboard is a
standard ATX motherboard and it supports
one two three four dual slot graphics
cards so you can actually use quad
crossfire X on a standard ATX board MSI
has pulled an engineering to here in
order to enable that now it's gonna run
8 X 8 X 8 X 8 X in all likelihood
although I haven't checked but ninety
ninety percent will but that doesn't
actually
have an impact on any of the high
performance GPUs these days including
the 5870 very cool feature so we've got
their active phase switching technology
this is for power saving what it does is
it actually turns off CPU power phases
that are not in use in order to get the
most efficiency whether you're at idle
or load on your CPU
there's your ham free socket supporting
triple I'd rather triple dual channel
ddr3 memory and it looks like MSI has
taken another page out of one of their
competitors books here and they have
their single side installation for the
memory module so you just slide it into
one side and then clip it shut on the
other side dr. Moss okay green power
Express cool rapid boost okay we already
talked about this on the back let me see
if there's anything under the sticker of
note and no there isn't
oh yes there is there is a voltage check
point for your REM right in there I
don't know if the cameraman can see that
or not he says not really but it's in
there I assure you it is okay what else
do we have I'm gonna see if I can find
any other voltage check points here and
I'm just gonna put this down on the
table so we can have a better look under
the good light um-hmm not so much so far
well I'm not gonna worry too much about
that for now why don't we have a look at
what else this board has to offer
our eight pin connectors and it's ideal
location up at the top left of the board
right next to this huge huge beefy
looking chipset and mah MOSFET cooler it
looks like the North Bridge is actually
under this part and then this part is
dedicated to cooling the MOSFETs here's
that flat thick heat pipe that they
talked about going down to the South
Bridge there and then we have our 24 pin
power connector right where it belongs
one IDE connector here is a SATA 2 port
running off a JMicron controller as we
as is this IDE port and probably any
SATA port on the back then on this side
we have 6 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
ports so those are running off the SB
850 Southbridge next we have our easy
button I love these I love these touch
sensitive buttons the first time I saw
this was on the p55 GD 80 and I'm glad
that they're continuing to do this
because I think it's so cool
then we have a little OCD dial so that
seems pretty self-explanatory plus and
minus depending on how fast you want the
CPP's tip cpu to go then there's an OC
dial button I'm guessing that enables it
and then we have their green power
button okay then we have three USB 2.0
front headers we have firewire two
firewire front headers and then in
addition to that we have not a whole lot
else I'm gonna have one more quick scan
here and see if I can find like a CPU
voltage readout point or anything like
that you know what it might be there
somewhere if you can find it feel free
to leave a comment on my video and let
me know where it is
let's have a look at the back panel
connectors oh cameraman wants to look at
that
sweet erm the Northbridge cooling
solution I think that is very cool I
really like it actually here get it from
this angle from this angle
see these are actually wavy in order to
give it slightly more surface area and a
little bit better turbulence for any
airflow that does happen to go through
there very cool okay oh yeah I guess the
rest of the slots I didn't even talk
about there's one more PCIe 1x slot and
a PCI slot as if anyone cares if you buy
this motherboard do me a favor and load
it up with a bunch of graphics cards
because that is what it is for okay
let's have a look at our connectors on
the back we've got ps2 mouse and
keyboard two dedicated ports we have a
clear CMOS button and it's a very very
ideal location right on the back we have
optical as well as coaxial audio out so
digital formats both then we have one of
those USB eSATA ports so six USB 2.0
ports one eSATA then we have two Gigabit
Ethernet two USB 3.0 as well as 7.1
audio out thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the 890 FX a GD 70</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
