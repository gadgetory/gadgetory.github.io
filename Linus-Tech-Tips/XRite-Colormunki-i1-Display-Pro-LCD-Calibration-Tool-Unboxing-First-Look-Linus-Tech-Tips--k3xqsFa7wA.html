pretty fascinating for me so this is a
cup this is going to be two different
unboxings at the same time this is going
to be the color monkey from x-ray and
the eye one display Pro from x-ray these
are both display calibration devices
which have a couple of different while
differences so the color monkey for
example if for starters can be used for
either displays or for projectors and
they can be used in a couple of
different ways to achieve that the whole
setup process takes about five minutes
and it is useful for a number of
different things so number one is it
actually allows you to so it has a
sensor that you I've opened this before
I've actually used it already so I'm
pretty impressed with the results so I
decided to do a video about it so it's
not a color sensor here which you
basically put up against the the screen
and then it takes some readings it
changes what's on the screen and then it
basically adjusts your the profile of
your of your video output in order to
make it match as closely as possible to
what's real now what's cool about this
is that you then take it and stick it on
your desk where it acts as an ambient
light sensor and it will continue if
it's still plugged in my USB to your
computer it will continue to adjust your
monitor settings according to what the
ambient light situation is to make sure
that you're always looking at as
accurate and image as possible just very
cool like outstanding so why would you
want the most accurate possible color
well if you're working with anything to
do with print then you want to make sure
that these colors are as calibrated as
these colors and they're both as similar
as possible that's very important if
you're doing anything to do with graphic
design you want to make sure that
whatever you're working on is gonna look
correct no matter where it's being
viewed or as close as possible and you
want to again be working with as
accurate as possible colors and know
this will not turn your TN panel into
you know a perfect display for a graphic
design and photo work unfortunately not
you will still need a good high quality
display and there's no getting around
that but this will take your non factory
calibrated monitor and almost no
monitors unless they're very high in
professional
or something like a Seuss's PA series we
got one over there that we use for our
monitoring while we're filming right
there bro are those factory
calibrated but most of them do not so
here you go
he got monitor calibration ambient light
measurement as well as projector
calibration by setting it up on the
little stand like this there's a there's
a way to do this you're gonna have to
trust me on this there you go can
calibrate your projector that one got
very cool stuff so before and after
automatic display control yeah new state
of the art etc etc it's also not that
expensive I mean it used to be wasn't
that long ago that any kind of colored
calibrator device was gonna be running a
couple hundred bucks but that's not
really the case anymore so something
like the color monkey is something you
could actually buy just for home use no
big deal
now the i1 display Pro the biggest
difference that we found was already can
be bright so it can be used for floor
fluorescent back lights LED as well as
wide gamut LCDs so you don't have to
worry about what kind of LCD you have
you know is it gonna work is it not
gonna work it will work so this got it
right here
not only can it calibrate your display
or your projector it can also be used
for cue seeing displays so let's say you
are a graphic design studio or something
you're not buying you know $1,500 each
monitors that had come pre calibrated
and are perfect so let's say you're like
you know a real company that's not
running on like a baller budget you grab
one of these and then the displays that
you bring in you can use this to keep
suit and you can go okay I don't have to
say right so you can specify what kind
of Delta's you expect and you can
actually display quality check and
trending over time so that's really cool
because you can get it to pay attention
to
oh yeah right and you can actually match
multiple monitors and work groups as
well so this is all neat because let's
say you have like a lab and you're
buying ten monitors a recorder or
whatever else you can use this to keep
track of are they getting better are
they getting worse are they all matching
so that if someone moves from one
workstation to another one I'm working
on a project day one to day two they
don't have to make a bunch of
adjustments
they won't think that something's wrong
so that's the difference between the
more professional oriented one versus
the color monkey's so there's also okay
what else they got here so you guys can
see what they have going for them you
can actually check out the x-ray site if
you want to get more information on
trending over time trending over time is
more of an issue with CCFL backlit
monitors LEDs don't really suffer from
that nearly as much as well as
projectors that's a big deal with
projectors and I think that pretty much
so thank you for checking out this dual
unboxing of the i1 display pro as well
as the color monkey from x-ray don't
