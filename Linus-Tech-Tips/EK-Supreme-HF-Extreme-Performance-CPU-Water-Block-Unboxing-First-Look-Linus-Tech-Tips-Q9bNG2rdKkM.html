probably not a hundred percent but what
are you gonna do I'm going to be
unboxing and having a quick look at the
ek supreme hf so this is basically like
the old EK supreme except better and
what makes it better is that it's higher
flow and in theory it performs better
it's available in four different flavors
copper plexi copper acetal nickel plexi
and nickel acetal so basically i'll
explain what that means in a minute when
we get the block open you can see that
actually I don't think I've ever unboxed
an ek product on my blog but they have
dramatically improved their packaging
from where it was a year plus ago and
now you can see they've got like this
they've got like this color-coded theme
going so this is a CPU block but they
have like codes for reservoirs radiators
I don't know what these are
maybe these aren't reservoirs I don't
know something else whatever but this is
a block okay it's orange
so it's color coded okay yeah here we go
extreme cooling performance standard tea
1/4 threads for all standard flow
systems low restriction and pressure
drop mounting mechanism included and
high quality materials used I mean at
the end of the day there's not a whole
lot you can say in terms of marketing
speech about something like the water
block because it either looks good and
performs or it doesn't look good and
doesn't perform because that's all the
water cooling guys really care about is
how does it look and what's the
performance like so the first thing
we've got in terms of accessories is a
standard bolt through mounting kit so
you got four screws are Siamese pardon
me four bolts four Springs eight washers
and four thumb screws or thumb nut so
those you don't need a back plate in
order to mount them but it looks like ek
has included back plates so I should
just kind of stuff that in here okay and
then we've got 5 X 4 accelerator plates
so the block actually includes one so
depending on whether you want more flow
okay so this would be a higher flow
design versus if you want a more
concentrated focused design say for
example if you have a smaller die and
you're not so much worried about the
performance of other blocks in your
system or there's a compromise here for
like a larger die you can actually tweak
the way this block flows and they even
include a blank one that you can use to
cut your own so that's pretty cool it
includes
instruction manual okay which gives you
the basics for how to install it you
could use your bolt through you do this
you do that connecting the water okay
shows all of your different okay so the
number three is the stock ones that
includes all of the other ones
alright so let's have a look at the back
plate oh this is really nice you can't
ever used to include back plates with
their blocks which is why I seemed they
didn't but it looks like in here we've
got four plastic washers as well as a
very nice rubber rubber piece here to
keep the backplate away from the back of
your board as well as a metal backplate
very nice okay do not forget other UK
products are there that's what the codes
mean all right that's not so difficult
okay now let's get oh it comes with some
mx2 thermal compound great I love seeing
a high quality thermal compound included
with cooling products ok so then we've
actually got the ek supreme HF this is a
snazzy-looking block so the materials
basically okay so my battery ran out
sorry about that
either way basically why like I was
saying we're looking at the base
material here so as I mentioned before
this is a flexi copper model so this
would be kind of a silver color if we
were looking at the at the nickel plated
model and then the top would be plexi
okay
or it could be acetal which would be
like a black a black solid material
rather than one that you can see through
okay so we've got like a black hold down
plate which is very nice it's powder
coated so that's gonna be a very durable
finish there and we should do the
obligatory look how shiny that is shot
holy smokes look at that that is very
nice you can like see all around the
cameraman's office here depending where
I aim it that's pretty cool anyway so
that pretty much covers it I mean the
performance of this block is estimated
to be around the same as some of the
other top performing blocks in the
market so I do plan to have a look at
that later on down the road anyway thank
you for checking out my quick unboxing
and first look at the ek supreme HF</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
