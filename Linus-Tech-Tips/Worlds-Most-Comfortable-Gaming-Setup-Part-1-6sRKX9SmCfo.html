one side of my home office I've got that
server cabinet that's full of networking
gear gaming rig servers battery backups
the whole nine yards and on the other
side of it in this room I've got a whole
lot of nothing time to fix that today I
will be constructing what I call TM the
world's most comfortable gaming setup so
come along for the ride
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description so first things first
we're going to take this Samsung 65 inch
curved su HDTV up to the room and do a
test fit something that I actually have
not done yet so the position of the TV
is actually going to be one of the
things that makes this the most
comfortable gaming setup we could have
just put it against the wall right here
and put like a chair over here and call
it a day but no that is not the world's
most comfortable so now the TV is
actually going to mount to this 55
degree wall and the viewer will actually
sit right here there we go of course
this is not that comfortable and this
the pillow sack provided by loveSac comm
is the solution to that problem let's
get this in there so what makes this the
optimal piece of furniture a beanbag
chair is that I can get the user
reclined at exactly the angle that the
TV will be at above him see that oh yeah
hey do you guys mind throwing the TV up
here so I can see what the viewing
distance is gonna look like
I'd imagine this is what it's like to be
ludicrously wealthy you wouldn't
actually mount anything you would just
have like you would just have staff on
hand that would just move things and
hold them wherever you need them so
it'll probably be about eight or twelve
inches off the wall this is going to be
freaking sick okay thanks guys
awesome let's get started but we've got
some challenges to overcome in here
first the Kenai dam um you might have
noticed that this room other than this
horrible light fixture up here
has no power no network and in fact has
no insulation just like the one on the
other side and if you're going to have a
most comfortable gaming setup well the
plan better be to have it in an
insulated room don't you think in fact
the only electronics in this room right
now are this Chubb caretaker from what
appears to be this chip was manufactured
in 92
okay somebody spread that insulation
around well that explains why the garage
was so cold during the early days of
lioness Media Group we were all working
over there
there was no insulation
if we want to come quite low because
remember it's little kids okay so I'm
thinking for instead of trying to match
the base in here we'll just go with a
flat stock trip with everything ripped
off the wall let's go through the plan
in a little bit more detail it's changed
a fair bit from the original concept and
now it's going to be kind of like a cool
kids play area as well so this hunk of
wall right here is actually going to
have a framed like metal plate that goes
down to about here it's going to be like
a cool magnet wall this right here is
going to be power for a reading lamp and
right here is going to be another
beanbag kind of a lounger that's kid
sized for them to sit and read the
bookshelves will be covered in books and
DVDs and games and then here we've
roughed in the spot where the TV is
going to go so we play it around with
our mount a little bit and it looks like
it's going to end up on I believe it was
yep it's going to go as far left as it
can on these two so our power is going
to come out kind of in the center and
then our data connection so we're going
to have Ethernet for the back of the TV
as well as Samsung's one connect do that
right here so that way all of our HDMI
inputs can actually be over here on this
wall and just this one cable needs to
run between that and the TV itself over
on this wall I'm going to have
everything wall mounted PC Xbox Network
switch so that everything has networking
running over to the other room and
anything else that I could see fit
including this one connect box itself
which is going to be powered Oh doesn't
use separate power that's cool I guess
it's powered by the TV this box right
here is going to provide power for
everything that's mounted to this wall
and is also going to give us with the
access panel that we're going to build
in over here the ability to vent this
room later on in the future if we decide
to do that but we may not up here we're
going to do two 6-inch dimmable pot
lights and then the room itself I
believe the ceiling is going to be black
and the walls are going to be kind of
brightly colored and and
fun so hopefully we have enough light
but we can get it dark enough for a
really great movie gaming experience
this crappy little side table from Ikea
is going to be cut off and is going to
be beanbag chair height and is going to
sit right here next to the beanbag with
another little lamp on it just in case
you want to sit on this one and read and
the carpet is going to be replaced
because who puts artificial turf in
their house
ok Linus so that's great that's what
everyone but you is doing what are you
actually contributing to this project ah
yes I have something I am going to be
building a sick wall-mounted computer to
go in that room to power the gaming
experience on the ceiling mounted TV how
do you build a wall-mounted computer
well you could DIY it I guess but I'm
going to be taking the easy route using
a Lele PCO 6sx
let's get this baby put together so for
the motherboard we went with a Maximus 8
Jean this is pretty much the no
compromises M ATX board for LGA 1150
it's a Ford's SLI and crossfire it's got
all the outputs you could want and build
quality to match our CPU and RAM choices
are admittedly kind of overkill we're
using a core i7 6700 K quad core with
hyper threading and 32 gigs of Corsair
Vengeance lpx ddr4 memory but I mean hey
maximum comfort requires maximum
performance right right
this is a really cool case they've got
some cases astonishingly to add thermals
see it's a lot of things like this that
drive me crazy with not just lately all
case manufactures you couldn't spring
for three more zip locks every computer
manufacturer hates me personally gtx
1070 feels like a perfect choice for
this machine cross threading it
all right so this baby's ready let's
bring it back upstairs and find
something else to do I'm going to be
taking some of the leftover cat 5e cable
from my how to run Ethernet outside your
house video which you can check out
right over here I'm going to be running
it from my server room across the peak
I'm actually going to have to crawl
through a crawl space in my attic over
to the new room so that you know whether
it's games or whether it's Netflix I
don't have to worry about a wireless
connection being a bottleneck wired only
baby you know what I'm gonna get myself
a head lamp hold on I'm gonna poke a
wire through over there first
did ya go well I'm back in so are you
going to the other side now yeah I'm
gonna fall all the way to the other side
can't wait for you to add the other side
yeah you might be able to see me if you
poke your head in okay so this clip is
having just gone in from the server room
I have to crawl through that hole oh my
god Dennis just fell down yes what the
hell Dennis please don't fall through my
ceiling Dennis did you put your foot
through my ceiling oh my god
you
oh my god I always been up on your phone
your cookstove crotch oh man yeah I know
the thud oh god dammit Dennis I almost
died
so we interrupt this program to bring
you stunning footage of the damage that
Dennis has done to my house
there's the brand-new hole in my ceiling
of my garage that we had not intended to
put there is this a bit of a blue no it
is not supposed to be made of wood
Dennis not it's supposed to invade a
drywall so from now on I'm gonna call
this the Dennis hole hi Dennis serious
thing and cheese all right okay come on
back up here and let's see if I can
crawl back where I'm supposed to be I
could have done
so you know I only step on the pieces of
wood dentist that is how you're supposed
to do it how did you know that um I
thought everything
not that I would let Dennis have any but
blue apron allows you to create
delicious chef inspired food at home
they deliver all the farm-fresh
ingredients you need right to your
doorstep in exactly the right
proportions no trip to the grocery store
no waste from unused ingredients they've
got a couple of different plans there's
the two-person plan and the family plan
and blue aprons recipes are delivered in
a refrigerated box so the ingredients
will stay fresh even if you're not at
home when your package arrives they
offer a huge selection of recipes and
are always adding new dishes to the menu
every week there is no commitment you
can skip or cancel the service at any
time if you're going on vacation or
you've got a special occasion and each
menu is between 800 and 500 calories per
person but the best part for me is that
all the meals can be prepared in 40
minutes or less meaning that blue apron
actually takes less time than going out
to eat not to mention that you're
learning to make these recipes so hey
