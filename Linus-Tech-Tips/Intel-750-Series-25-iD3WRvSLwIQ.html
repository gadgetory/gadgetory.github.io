that Linus has a very very fast car but
I actually have a very very fast SSD so
I've got that going for me which is nice
stay subscribed Linus tech tips for more
videos on very very fast things
the Coursera HX 1200 I power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet efficient power for Corsair link
digital and advanced monitoring and
control click now to learn more so let's
kick this off of the statement you won't
often hear me repeating unless you've
seen all the takes for this shot this is
the fastest consumer SSD on the market
this is the fastest consumer SSD on the
market today this is the fastest
consumer SSD on the market today
HC our age so why do I keep tripping on
things this is the fastest consumer SSD
on the market today hands down there's
been a lot of hype around these drives
and now it's easy to understand why the
Intel 750 series SSDs post some
seriously ridiculous performance numbers
thanks to Intel utilizing a controller
based on the nvm Express protocol which
is designed to replace the HCI
architecture we've seen on SATA drives
for a while now ABI was designed
predominantly for spinning media or hard
drives and vme has been developed
entirely for non-volatile memory storage
which means it doesn't have to deal with
the extra weight and the legacy support
built into HCI resulting in a more
streamlined command set which can be
which can work beautifully in
parallelism which can benefit from
modern multi-core CPUs but before we
delve into the performance of these
drives and the impact that nvme has had
of course we need to talk about the
drive itself we only have the 2.5 inch
drive in office right now we may be
getting a PCIe add-in card version for a
special project that we have coming up
soon so stay tuned and stay subscribe to
the channel if you want to see all about
that but it doesn't really matter
because in terms of performance the
add-in card and the 2.5 inch form factor
drive both have the exact same
components inside just with a different
physical appearance layout and obviously
the connector but why did they even
create two versions of the same
components more on that in just a moment
first the physical overview the front is
fairly reminiscent of past Intel
enthusiasts SSDs but here we notice the
first shift from gaming performance to
data center performance the old skull
logo has been replaced by serial numbers
and product specs when we turn the drive
to its side you'll notice a significant
difference in thickness when compared to
the previous generations of Intel SSDs
it is not a thin drive by any means at
15 millimeters and because of that it
will not fit into many height restricted
SSD mounts just a heads up when we
finally flip to the back of the drive we
see one of the reasons why this drive is
so thick the massive badass-looking
heatsink no more super rough looking
finish on the back of your intel SSD
last but not least we have the 86 39
connector which splits twice to receive
power through a standard SATA interface
and to send data through an SFF 86 43
also known as mini SAS HD connector
which finally connects to a hyper kit
from asus now the hyper kit is quite a
special little connector designed by
asus which allows you to go from the
mini SAS HD connector into the hyper kit
module then into an m dot 2 interface
which is able to fully connect to the
PCIe gen3 lanes all the way directly to
the cpu which is why it is able to offer
the same amount of performance as the
add-in card which is great because say
you had an ITX 9 x99 motherboard that
was compatible with the hyper kit you'd
be able to have a powerful graphics card
and an nvme drive which is pretty sick a
quick reminder this is using PCIe lanes
on your CPU which is great but something
you may want to take into account for
certain setups possibly SLI stuff things
like that the drives will still be
awesome if you have to connect it
through something like the PCH
considering you ran out of lanes but if
you want the best possible performance
you will want it to directly access the
CPU through those PCIe lanes and with
that all out of the way onto
benchmarking we put the Intel 750 series
up against an enthusiasts grade
traditional-style if I can call it that
SATA SSD the Samsung 850 Pro the 850 Pro
is well regarded as a high-end SSD and
honestly it's pretty
badass but man it got absolutely
destroyed by the until 750 series drive
first up we have crystal fist mark which
is the most important benchmark in our
suite by far the reason for its
importance is that Intel worked with the
developers of crystal dis Marc to ensure
that the program will be able to deploy
multiple workers with the 750 series
drives feeding directly into the CPU
through the PCIe lanes you'll need a
benchmarking worker per CPU thread
including hyper threads to fully utilize
the drive as you can see the 750 killed
it getting 5 times faster sequential
reads almost three times faster
sequential writes both running on one
thread seven freaking times faster 4k
reads and a bit over four times faster
4k writes at eight threads on to more
standard less optimised benchmarks we
have the Intel drive with displayed
reads five times greater than that of
the Samsung Drive as well as write
speeds approximately two and a half
times greater than the Samsung drive in
a doe disk mark the black magic disk
speed test results were showed Intel
having a read speed almost four times
higher than its competitor and a write
speed approximately two point four times
greater now it is important to keep in
mind that all of these tests are
synthetic and different for various
reasons and may not be perfectly
representative of real-world situations
we did attempt a few standard wheeled
world SSD benchmarks but we ran into a
fairly strange issue the Intel drive was
simply too fast to produce meaningful
results in our normal real-world test
suite as it was bottlenecks by other
components in our system in other
real-world benchmarks we have attempted
this wasn't really a problem and
naturally we'll find ways to go around
this but for now Dan so I guess that
leads fairly well into our conclusion
for this video this is a new drive for
Mattel and it's ridiculously fast it is
without a doubt the fastest consumer
grade SSD on the market today but that
speed does come at a cost and vme is
still very new to the consumer space and
if you don't want to take up a PCI slot
on your motherboard the 2 and 5 inch
drive with the hyper kit solution is the
only currently officially supported by a
few motherboards we haven't even
received word yet on what
other motherboard manufacturers will
support this drive and even if they do
we have no clue when their solutions
will be available what do you guys think
of nvme let me know in the comments down
below or honestly preferably over on the
forum but while you're here before you
go to the forum like dislike favorite
subscribe share all that kind of fun
stuff in the description below this
video you can see any links you need to
see you can also see cool links to buy
awesome shirts and stuff like that
if you check out the support us link
over on the forum you can see how to do
things like change your Amazon affiliate
code which helps us out a ton install
the forum helping add-on from for
Firefox or Google Chrome which can do
things like tell you when you get PMS
and change those Amazon links for you if
you enable it also become a contributor
on the forum it's super duper freakin
helpful anyways guys thanks for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
