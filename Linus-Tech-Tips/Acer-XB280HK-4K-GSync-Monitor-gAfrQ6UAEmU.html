attention to the gaming monitor market
again they've dabbled in the past they
hadn't at the time excellent 3d vision
monitor the GD to 35 Hz but since then
they appear to have been sitting on
their collective thumbs until now
welcome to my video about one of the in
my mind only to gsync monitors that
really matters for high-end gaming the
acer XB 280 HK corsair gaming RGB
keyboards feature precision Cherry MX
RGB key switches for sixteen point eight
million color per key backlighting for
virtually unlimited customization click
now to learn more we'll start with a
physical overview around this massive 28
inch sixteen by nine panel with the OSD
controls embedded in the bottom right is
an unfortunately thick and glossy bezel
something I find particularly
disappointing given how ahead of the
curve Acer was on the super thin bezel
thing when they released the h2 36
HL about a year and a half ago the stand
is a circular base affair with an orange
accent it assembles to lessly in about
30 seconds and gives the xB to a thk
tilt swivel height adjust and pivot the
quad facta of ergonomic display
adjustment options it serves his purpose
very well but I didn't find its build
quality particularly
confidence-inspiring
especially at this kind of a price point
although given that we know a g-sync
module adds about $200 to the cost of a
monitor and Acer's offering is priced
about $200 higher than otherwise similar
4k displays that also don't feature
beautifully over built stance
I don't think acer is cutting this
corner any tighter than anyone elses on
the top bottom and right of the monitors
a whole lot of nothing but on the left
we're treated to 2 of the 4 USB 3 ports
that run off the monitors internal hub
then on the bottom we find the tell-tale
signs of Ag sync monitor aside from the
USB 3 uplink the other two ports that go
with it and an AC power input we've got
a whole lot
not much going on down here just a
DisplayPort 1.2 input this is because in
videos first generation Jason module
only supports a single DisplayPort input
so then why would you want to gsync
module and your monitor - great question
g sync delivers smoother on-screen
animations by eliminating screen tearing
you know those ugly horizontal lines
through the image where it seems like
the top half of the screen has the last
frame in the bottom half has a new one
and leg which is caused by your GPU
waiting for the monitor to be ready for
a refresh when running with vsync on the
way that we traditionally get rid of
tearing but you can learn more about it
in this video here just trust me it
works and it's a pretty big deal but
better perceived smoothness and gaming
animation won't do us any good if it's
not presented on a good quality panel so
let's have a look shall we the XP 280 HK
uses the same type of panel that we've
already seen before in the other low ish
cost 4k monitors that we've covered here
and here so there weren't really any
surprises contrast is pretty good color
reproduction is surprisingly good for a
TN panel and pixel response times we're
good without excess ghosting and
overdrive artefacts even on fast-moving
scenes as long as you leave the
overdrive setting at default within the
on screen display in fact I found most
of the settings in the OSD were best
left alone I adjusted color temp to
normal and everything else especially
the image profiles just made the screen
look much much worse so I didn't find
myself using them in front of the
flicker free DC controlled backlight we
find a matte finished panel which is
good if you hate glare and reflections
with horizontal viewing angles that are
good enough as long as you're sitting
mostly centered in front of the screen
the way most people use a computer the
subtle green and Bend paint color shift
is unlikely to bother you much on the
desktop and is pretty much impossible to
pick up with a full screen game or movie
running vertical viewing angles just
like the other low-cost 4 k's are less
impressive though with a noticeable
gradient from warmer to cooler looking
from bottom to top even with your head
in a stationary position
again this is something that's nearly
impossible to pick up in games and many
people won't notice it at all anyway but
I look at a lot of monitors so
particularly on uniform backgrounds like
when reading emails or message boards I
find it a little bit distracting but
let's change gears a bit here and talk
about the gaming experience I suspect if
a sir could have timed the release of
their XP to a thk 28 inch 4k g-sync
gaming monitor anymore perfectly the
entire world would have imploded two
weeks ago the GTX 980 and 970 wouldn't
have existed yet and graphics cards with
enough horsepower to run modern games at
4k would have started at 500 plus
dollars rather than 330 and they would
have been equipped with a mere three
gigs of VRAM probably fine for now but
not exactly future-proof had acer waited
oh I don't know another year to release
this monitor we'd probably have better
cards capable of running triple-a titles
pinned at 60fps so the need for variable
refresh rate technology that masks
stuttering when the framerate drops will
be reduced but as it is the timing is
great and this monitor and those
graphics cards are a match made in
heaven
the way I benchmarked the XP to ATH came
was a little bit different than normal
because it's mostly about the subjective
experience instead of firing up games
and staring at my fraps counter then
dialing in graphic settings until the
number looks good I went the other way
around I cranked everything to max
started turning things down until the
game felt 60fps smooth then fired up
fraps to see what framerate I was
actually running at even though I've
evaluated jisuk monitors before I've
never done it this way and I think the
results may shock you I found that
because of the pixel density of the
display anti-aliasing was superfluous
beyond 2x NSAA which gave me more head
room to play with eye-candy options like
tessellation and higher-quality shadows
and to my surprise I discovered that as
long as my game wasn't falling below
around 40 frames per second during
demanding sequences it was running to my
eyes about as smoothly as if I was
at 60fps constantly and this is coming
from someone who has gained four years
on high-end hardware and considers
himself a bit of a framerate diva
so while I feel that lower-cost 1080p
g-sync monitors have a hard time
justifying that $200 or so premium
compared to their non g-sync cousins
especially when that money could be
spent on a better graphics card to keep
frame rates up or a higher resolution
monitor to improve immersion and image
quality when you've already got a
high-res monitor the addition of g-sync
enables a smoother gaming experience
with more details turned up then would
have conventionally been possible
potentially saving you some additional
investment in more graphics cards this
makes the xB 280 HK a very attractive
option for high-end GeForce gamers but
that doesn't mean that a sirs newBeauty
is the only horse on the track there are
two high res g-sync monitors that each
bring their own unique value proposition
to the table this baby is the resolution
King and the only option for someone who
wants a 4k display with g-sync
today while the rog swift masseuse is an
inch smaller diagonally and runs at a
mere 2560 by 1440 resolution but
delivers thinner bezels slightly better
colors and up to 144 Hertz refresh rates
so I guess this is what it boils down to
if you're a sightseer and most of your
gaming is done in third person or in
casually competitive scenarios where
lightning fast response times are not
critical
the xb2 ath K gets the nod if you're
looking for the best monitor on the
block for competitive play the rog swift
gets my vote for sure guys thanks for
