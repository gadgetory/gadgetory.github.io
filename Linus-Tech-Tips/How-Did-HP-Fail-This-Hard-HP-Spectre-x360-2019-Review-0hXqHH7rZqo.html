and all but I'm also a giant nerd and
always drooling over the next big thing
so I wouldn't mind upgrading it
and since razor wasn't able to scratch
that itch with their last blade stealth
I've been looking elsewhere for my
greener pastures now the surface laptop
- it's nice but I really want
Thunderbolt the MacBook Pro is Paige's
screenshot Oh
oh you're in trouble ya know Dell XPS 13
well you know what that one's close it's
definitely on my list of things to try
but HP I've been both hearing and even
experiencing really great things about
their x360 line for quite some time in
fact last time I looked at one two years
ago I called it the best two-in-one yet
but now that I have the 2019 versions of
the 13 and 15 inch spectre x360 s in my
hands it's clear to me that my search
isn't over yet because I wouldn't really
recommend buying either of these
something I would recommend buying
though is our sponsor private Internet
access looking for an affordable and
reliable VPN well P ia encrypts your
Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP check it out today at the
link in the video description
now the non-square corners of the new
x360 lineup might be a little bit
polarizing but for my part at least on
the 13-inch anyway I actually kind of
like it it's unique and I mean honestly
the look of this thing overall is
decidedly premium like it's it's almost
screaming for that first big bonus check
that a young professional takes home
from their first job out of school on
the right camper you'll find a
Thunderbolt 3 port with fast charging
nice so far so good
and on the left is the power button
where we actually encounter the first
problem at least with the 15 inch
version with the power cable plugged in
and pointing backwards you know where it
would normally go you actually can't
easily reach the power button like it's
not impossible and HP's rationale is
that it allows you easy access to the
power button in either laptop or tablet
mode but they also could have placed it
literally anywhere else along this edge
or oh I don't know this edge and it also
would have been accessible and avoided
the power cable issue fortunately what
helps make up for this is the decent i/o
on both models they managed to squeeze a
full-sized USB type-a onto the 13-inch
along with type-c Thunderbolt 3 micro SD
and a headphone jack and the 15 inch
even gets a full size HDMI port on top
of all of that and I mean just you know
what I actually love the style of these
things they managed to look really slim
and sleek while still having full sized
ports and being eye catching without
ending up being like tacky or gaudy
unfortunately while the look is very
premium the build quality is only good
like it's better than a typical and
nasai notebook but it's not on the same
level as the likes of Dell Microsoft or
Apple the aluminum chassis is rigid but
not stopped the aluminum chassis is
rigid but not
white is rigid as its carbon fiber and
magnesium counterparts and there's some
mild flex in the palm area and it's got
a screen that is wobblier than my weird
uncle on a Friday night
well any night performance-wise though
there's some good news
both of these laptops are standouts the
13-inch has a dual fan cooling design
that allows its quad-core processor to
hang with the likes of the XPS 13
putting light video editing or photo
editing easily within reach and for
those needing a bit more power stepping
up to the 15-inch looks like a great way
to go
rocking a 6 core core i7 8750 H and an
NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti the larger of the
spectres is able to hang with the XPS 15
for professional level performance or
even light gaming is what I would say if
this display here didn't have some of
the raunchiest pixel response times that
I've seen in the last five years like
seriously
I bet the camera could pick this up no
problem without even switching to
high-speed I'm talking 30 FPS mode just
moving the mouse pointer around on the
desktop makes it look like I've got
pointer trails enabled and that is on
top of the display having a little more
input lag than I'm used to
now neither of these things are really
noticeable on the 13-inch so that's well
I don't know I don't want to say good
because you don't really get any bonus
points for meeting basic expectations
but what is noticeable on both models
are the top and the bottom bezels
everywhere else in the industry
HP's competitors are moving either to
slim bezel 16 by 9 displays or taller
aspect ratios so that mobile users can
make the most out of the screen area HP
seems to have clearly missed the memo
here also very dated the 360 degree
hinge design this is a situation where
HP basically shot themselves in the foot
by creating maybe the best convertible
design ever with the Spector folio I was
really hoping that with this complete
redesign of the X 360 we would get that
hinge with a quad-core processor and
without the polarizing leather
but no it's just a regular convertible
laptop with a wobbly hinge and those
little feet that get in the way of the
left control and the right arrow key
back to the displays though response
times aside I do have some good things
to say here both of our models are
equipped with bright view displays that
feature HDR support along with excellent
color accuracy and contrast and I'm a
pretty big fan of their sure view
displays as well now these two units
don't have this function but basically
it's a toggleable privacy display which
is great if you want to keep your
information private in a public place
and as far as I know HP is the only one
that offers that function are they yeah
I'm not aware of anyone else you know
what just correct me in the comments if
I'm wrong anyway they also don't just
look good they feel good too with
excellent touch support along with a
really great drawing and writing
experience coming from the included pen
something that isn't bundled with
basically every other laptop on the
market but now we've come to the point
in this review where I need to address a
time in the past when I was wrong or
more accurately I was being facetious
I said that the pen holder on the
Spector folio was so bad that maybe they
just shouldn't include one at all well
no no it turns out that this having
literally no way to attach the pen to
your system at all is in fact worse
something is better than nothing
so okay HP you win sort of the webcam
falls considerably short of the surface
laptop but fortunately in this massive
forehead they were at least able to fit
Windows hello facial recognition which
saves HP from having to listen to me
complain about the location of this
fingerprint sensor why isn't it on the
power button oh wait I guess they didn't
get saved from it at all I did still
complain about it that's a shame
anyway you don't have to use it the
speaker grille placement above the
keyboard looks really nice and this
themselves are pretty good but while
that lost keyboards face at the top
isn't a problem for the 15 on the 13 it
means that anyone with big hands is
gonna end up resting uncomfortably on
this actually surprisingly sharp edge
what makes this more frustrating is that
otherwise this is quite a good keyboard
the keystrokes are long and quiet
and although the feel might not be quite
as crisp as the surface laptop I still
really appreciate what HP has done with
the switches with me being able to get
up to full speed very quickly what is
simply unacceptable though is the
trackpad and that's what actually
inspired the title of this video it's
the same unit on both models which means
that it's a pretty good size on that 13
inch and they both have very serious
palm rejection and acceleration issues
for some reason HP has opted to use
synaptics as touchpad drivers instead of
the windows precision ones and the
experience is just awful like here
what's this if I move slowly close to
the edge it's actually several
centimeters of movement before the
trackpad even registers my finger being
there it's so bad that when I first used
this machine I assumed it was broken and
that we would have to delay our review
so we could wait to swap it out for
another unit but then both of them
behaved in exactly the same way now as
it turns out this dead zone can be tuned
in the synaptic software but then you
get palm rejection issues because that's
how it does it and it also turns out
that other laptops do have a similar
dead zone like on the surface laptop it
turns out there is roughly a centimeter
on either side that isn't immediately
activated but the thing is that between
Alex and I we've been using the surface
laptop razor blade stealth many other
laptops for years and just like never
noticed it
whereas on these HP's it was apparent to
me
within about 30 seconds I was like
something is wrong oh it's like not
working because it's a full two and a
half centimeters on both sides so since
what the software is set to out of the
box does appear to be the better
solution compared to turning palm
rejection off at all the spectre x360
2019 ends up with the dubious honour of
tying the msi gs70 5 for worst trackpad
i've seen in years something that is
particularly unacceptable on a non
gaming device where you aren't expected
to regularly plug in a mouse speaking of
plugging in one area where the x360
13-inch really shines is in the battery
life department with its 60 watt hour
battery it delivers some truly
incredible time away from the wall after
a full 8 hour workday writing this
script with no plugging in the x3 6013
it still had 70% of its battery left
when it was time to head home
as for the 15-inch model well it's no
slouch either lasting through the
workday handily but it's 84 watt hour
battery can't quite compete with the 97
watt hour one in the Dell XPS 15 bottom
line time then overall neither the x360
13 or 15 inch did it for me on paper it
should be a pretty clear decision to
take this over something like a surface
laptop - it's got better battery life
better performance better connectivity
and better security features all for a
very similar price and it does feel like
HP has spent a lot of time working on
the details of this machine kind of like
there's a laptop design rubric created
by a consumer study that the engineers
have made sure that they get top marks
on the only problem is that when you
take a couple steps back from these
things and just use them the issues that
we've talked about especially the
trackpad are really hard to ignore all I
can hope for is that this is something
that HP can fix through software updates
and
redesign and funny funny yeah or that
speaking of 2020 you won't have to wait
until 2020 to go to LTX 2019 featuring
Dreamhack it's July 27th and 28th in the
