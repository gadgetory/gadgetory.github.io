today this is the Isuzu recov gamer's
branded board so you know it's going to
be feature-rich and have good
accessories and this is the crosshair 3
fórmula this is a motherboard it is
designed for gamers and it has support
for the AMD phenom ii x4 x3 it is 790 FX
and it has crossfire x support so the
first thing you will notice about the
price here 3 is that it has a window now
the motherboard doesn't have the window
the box has a window so you can actually
check out the board on the store shelf
before you buy they've done a quick
overview of the features that set this
board apart so let's go through that
really quickly here you've got metal ok
which is a solution that allows you to
press a button on the board and in
theory it should be able to post with
pretty much any memory which will allow
you to get into the BIOS configure the
optimal settings and then get the
computer running you've got CPU level up
which is a simple click for instant
upgrade basically a software
overclocking utility supreme FX with x5
software that's pretty cool so they've
updated their supreme effects a little
daughterboard sound card 2 X 5 then
you've got a bundled copy of 3d Marco 6
and Kaspersky antivirus and then oh yeah
we've also got start and reset buttons
onboard I always like to see that on any
high end or even a low end board it's a
great feature on the back it reiterates
pretty much the same thing and yeah
that's it ok so let's get this thing
open and dive right into what is
arguably the highest end and three board
out there right now so accessory package
first as per my usual arrangement you've
got a nice black box here containing all
of your accessories so first of all
you've got an IDE cable alright then
you've got five SATA cables this is kind
of an odd number of state of cables okay
five and then you've got a USB and
firewire PCI backplate then you have the
LCD poster now the LCD posters been
around for a while in there Republic of
gamers line and I've never seen it do
anything more useful then inform you
with a cpu in it
error that your board isn't working but
if I didn't already know it wasn't
working I wouldn't have plugged in the
LCD poster okay there's your 7.1 audio
as well as your two different kinds of
digital audio out with the supreme FX
listen with absolute HP X Phi supports
up to EAX 4.0 this is a PCI Express 1.0
card okay sorry PCI Express with 1x card
next we have some zip ties for cable
management then we have their cue
connector technology I mean most cases
come with block connectors Newsday's
anyway so it's not a huge deal but it's
nice to have then you've got an i/o
shield okay and then the crosshair 3
fórmula user's guide as well as a
drivers DVD don't use fast download the
latest drivers off the manufacturers
website as per my usual advice alright
next let's get to the board itself so it
comes in its nicely little windowed
casing here let's get the top plastic
cover off and figure out how to get it
out of here I think I need to here we go
ok so first thing let's do the general
layout so you've got your power
connectors in their usual desirable
places with the 24 pin along the
right-hand edge and the 8 pin up at the
top left corner of the board you can see
the plug right here for your LCD poster
so be aware of that and then you've got
your power design or your whatever 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 faves power design right
here as well as your mosfet cooling and
your Northbridge and Southbridge cooling
then you've got your am-3 socket so this
supports an three ddr3 chips only at
will at this time only ddr3 chips
because all of the DIMM slots on the
motherboard are ddr3 dual channel ddr3
compatible down at the bottom you've got
three PCI Express one exports one PCI
port and then two PCI Express 16 exports
these operate at full 16x and they are
compatible with crossfire but not with
SLI in terms of your oh yeah
here let's have a look at these onboard
power buttons so there's your start
there's your reset here
mm okay button and then clear CMOS is
still done with a jumper on this board
so you don't actually have a button for
that internally but more on that later
and then here we've got four SATA ports
that are right angle and then we have
one additional non angled SATA port now
let's have a quick look at the back
panel of the board so you've got six USB
ports that's very few on a board of this
sort of price point but I'm guessing
there's some kind of reason for it
you've got one ps2 keyboard port and
then you've got a clear CMOS button back
here honestly this is my favorite place
in the world for a clear CMOS button it
can come in handy and be a total
lifesaver then you've got eSATA firewire
and one and gigabit ethernet port so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the asustor republic of gamers
