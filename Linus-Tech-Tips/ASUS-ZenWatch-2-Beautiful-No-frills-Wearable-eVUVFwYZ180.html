the exclaimed xi3 access point which I
still stand behind a hundred percent
having been using them as our office
access points for a couple of months
especially now that they have their
cloud-based management tool up and
running and I'm going to do it again
with the Zen watch - this is an
imperfect but very compelling product
and you should seriously consider buying
one stay tuned to find out why
Corsairs RMI series power supplies
feature premium components for great
performance with very low noise check
out the link in the video description to
learn more it starts today as it always
seems to start with the physical tour of
the watch and given what a simple
devices and watch 2 is that's probably
not going to take very long at the back
you will find the magnetic charging
contact this does require a proprietary
cable but I understand that it's being
done for a reason the watch is ip67
rated making it waterproof for all but
the most demanding uses like diving and
at least by the look of things it's not
a system that will need to be reinvented
every single time Asus releases a new
watch like what pebble has been pulling
for the last couple of years moving to
the side we've got a traditional looking
crown but don't be deceived by its looks
it's just kind of mushy feeling home
button it's not a dial that can be spun
to travel through time or anything like
that and then at the front is depending
on which model of the Zen watch 2 you
opt for either a 37 millimeter 280 by
280 resolution display or a 41
millimetre 320 by 320 resolution display
no matter which display size you go for
you'll be getting what I would describe
as a functional but not particularly
stunning OLED panel with a curved piece
of Gorilla Glass 3 covering both it and
the larger than I would prefer bezels
then joining just about seamlessly with
the metal casing that makes up the main
body of the watch and that body that's
where things get interesting
I mean sure the specs are nice you got a
Snapdragon 400 processor 512 Meg's Ram 4
gigs of storage with Bluetooth Wi-Fi
connectivity with a 300 million power
battery in the smaller body and a 400
million power battery in the larger one
but the solid feel of the device is what
really makes the Zen watch to stand out
to me it's it's really well constructed
and manages to be low profile enough
that the smaller model will work great
for all but the daintiest of Lady arms
with the 42 millimeter being a good size
for most men although with my petite
wrists I actually found the smaller of
the 2 was a better fit
for me I just wish I'd gone with one of
the other available strap colors since
this taupe thing is pretty girly and
there's actually more good news as well
even with a mere 300 million power
battery the Zen watch - never went below
25 percent battery at the end of even
the longest of days for me with the
screen always displaying all my critical
information and a 5 second timeout on
the screen dimming function it's not
multiple day battery life like a pebble
but I've been trained at this point like
a like a seal to charge my devices daily
anyway so let's talk more usability
stuff just like with their motherboards
I initially ignored a Seuss's optional
software that goes with the watch some
because I just don't really care like
the Wellness one and others because I
was pretty sure that they would be buggy
full of spelling errors and generally
not very useful so to say that I was
pleasantly surprised by the Zen watch
manager app would be a gross
understatement it's actually full of
genuinely useful customization options
like being able to set the screen
dimming time out something Apple doesn't
allow for fear that their users will
discover what a power sucking piece of
wrist junk their watches the type of
hand movements on analog watch faces and
whether new notifications will pop up in
the bottom of the screen on their own or
stay hidden until you swipe them up a
really cool little touch for folks who
care about privacy and for folks who
just like their watch face to be clean
all the time not that I'm one of those
this was my preferred watch face for my
time with the Zen watch - I was able to
choose up to six widgets things like the
battery life of my phone battery life in
the watch the weather the community etc
that can actually be clicked on to
reveal more information if needed like
the weather one which we can swipe down
and see that a Chinese character in
there okay so there are definitely some
Polish issues the calendar widget on
this watch face clearly shows an event
on the preview yet when you press on it
there are no events which okay it worked
this time I can see the event but but
this is what I'm talking about there
there are some other imperfections that
I noticed as well like yes friends this
is the part of the video where I reveal
the ugly
clings that are going to break into your
house at night and eat your bacon or
whatever in my time with the watch I
experienced not one but two crashes one
where the Wellness app in spite of me
never once opening it crashed and needed
to be restarted and another where I
tried to do a factory reset because I
was switching phones and the watch was
just stuck on the shutting down screen
for several hours until the battery
drained and I was able to power back on
and reattempt the reset add to that the
occasional choppy animation of the UI
compared to my daily driver G watch R
which is odd because they're both
running Snapdragon 400 processor zat 1.2
gigahertz and the I would describe as
worse than average gesture detection to
wake up the screen and activate ok
Google and you've got some pretty you
know yo that's kind of a bummer issues
so then hold on a second - what was up
with that recommendation to buy it at
the beginning well the Sun watch - is a
hundred and fifty dollars that's the
punchline here if you're willing to
overlook these things
there's a beautiful well-constructed
no-frills wearable here that stands up
very well to other Android wear devices
and broadening the competitive analysis
I would argue that compared to the Apple
watch has better functionality I mean
I'll trade being able to see the damn
time whenever I please for Apple pay and
a heart rate sensor any day and on top
of that it turned heads the whole time I
was wearing it with people asking me
like a that looks nice is that the Apple
watch giving me an opportunity to
explain to them that no it's not it's
actually a much smarter purchase because
while like the Apple watch this product
is not perfect at least its flaws or
ones that don't interfere with basic
telling the time functionality and on
top of that its price allows me to
replace it with something much better a
generation or two down the line three
whole times by comparison speaking of
online payments like Apple pay if you're
building a mobile app and searching for
a simple payment solution you might want
to check out Braintree with the
Braintree V zero SDK which is just one
small snippet of code you can be all set
up and ready in less than 10 minutes to
take online payments and

support staff ready to walk you through
the process over the phone if you need
them their code supports Android iOS and
JavaScript clients and they have SDKs in
