click now to learn more the first thing
that caught my attention about this
product was its excellent packaging
something I appreciate as someone who
sees a lot of packages if you get my
drift the second thing that caught my
attention was how infuriatingly
difficult it was to extract the goods
from the package so to speak and I'm
sure there's a joke in there about how
blue my buds were getting by the time
that I actually finished but the real
question here is not how much innuendo
can I cram into my point about how hard
you have to work to get the jaybird blue
buds X earphones into your hands but
rather is it even worth the effort
I normally avoid doing videos about
lifestyle audio products they advertise
a bunch of features and then fail to
perform their most basic functionality
that is to reproduce audio with as much
fidelity as they can with a reasonable
degree of proficiency so let's start
with the bottom line then audio quality
when I was doing my listening tests on
the blue buds X I was not only pleased
with the level of performance I was
getting out of a mid-range pair of IMS
but I didn't even feel like I was making
compromises because their wireless rock
on jaybird I spent some time digging
through my music collection and figuring
out what kind of sound signature jaybird
was going for I had determined that they
sounded pleasing with satisfying impact
at the low end reasonable detail in the
highs and mids that were less pronounced
than I liked when I realized that they
advertised their response curve right on
the box
kudos appreciate this saves me some time
because I can just say they sound as
advertised
once I had determined they sounded good
the feature started to matter the
Bluebirds axe feature a remarkable eight
hour battery life that it pretty much
achieves in real world use an integrated
microphone for voice calls that my
brother described as decent in spite of
the fact that it was located behind my
ear at the time and Liquipel sweat
repellent nanotechnology with a lifetime
Sweatt warranty to back it up the
package includes a variety of
tips three sizes of sports ear cushions
to help them stay in and a large hard
carrying case that fits the included
charging cable and the earphones
themselves there are also cable
management clips for wearing the blue
buds X as an over-the-air headset and
finally there is a manual with excellent
instructions on how to set them up so
let's take a look at them physically
these are big in ears but that makes
sense since they have to contain
wireless communication tech and the
battery it did make me worried about how
well they would fit though since I have
pretty small ear canals more on that
later
speaking of batteries the microUSB
charging port is accessed by popping off
the backing of the left earpiece just
like so and it's got three inline
buttons that you can use to control
power calls media playback and volume
control depending on how long you press
them for in practice that works but if
you've also got a pebble or other
SmartWatch that's even awesomer
I find reaching for my wrists a bit
easier to do between rallies than
reaching behind my head but your mileage
may vary on that one so back to how well
they fit the manual says to try the
under the ear fit first so I promptly
set myself up with the smallest ear tip
and between the size of the buds and the
weight of the cord they just fell out I
guess I was expecting that so I gave up
immediately and set them up as over the
year something I'm already used to for
my IE 80s it took me about five minutes
to set up and adjust the wire management
clips by the way the inclusion of an
extra wire management clip in the case
in case I lose or break one is a very
nice touch and now they fit so it's time
to head to the court and stress test
them with some badminton singles pairing
is lightning fast and the range is
perfect for the products intended use I
didn't experience any interruptions
whether my phone was actually on me or
sitting at courtside the tops of my ears
easily support the weight of the wires
and I didn't even need their sports ear
cushions for them to stay in flawlessly
A+ for comfort
the only thing that weirded me out a bit
is that as someone who carries IMS 24/7
I felt a little bit naked without wires
but I'm sure I'd get used to that
noise isolation is maybe a touch too
much to use these in a team sport but
this is a big point in the products
favored for bass response and listening
immersion so there's no 100% right
answer there the product isn't perfect
yet though volume adjustment is
something they need to address I'd like
to see it tied into the phone's volume
control like most other Bluetooth audio
devices as it is they're separate and
when you make adjustments using the
inline button it actually temporarily
cuts off the music with each button
press also when you wear them in over
the ear mode the stereo sound is
reversed because you are physically
inserting them into your ears the other
way I guess it's not a huge deal since
the product is not intended for me to
sit back in my comfortable chair
reveling in my audio snobbery but rather
for me to use when I should probably be
focused on something else but it's still
something I wouldn't mind seeing
addressed with a version 2 product
something good did come out of that
channel switching issue though their
support blew my giraffe in mind you call
the number on their website go through
one menu layer to indicate that you're a
customer yes a company that doesn't
divide callers up further by support and
pre-sales inquiries or as I call it
people whose money that we already have
and people whose money we're still
trying to get and a real person picks up
in like 10 seconds their live chat was
actually even faster they responded
while I was on the phone for 10 seconds
so much Wow
anyway it's conclusion time now and
let's put it this way they will not be
replacing my IE 80s as my daily drivers
but these cost three times as much no
they're going to be my workout in gym in
ears and they absolutely Rock for that
though honestly if I didn't already own
mid to upper tier IMS then they would be
a candidate for everyday use they're
really solid I mean I was intrigued when
a viewer sent me this review suggestion
but I didn't have much hope for them
because mainstream audio stuff is
usually flashy junk but I figured I
couldn't go wrong because in my
conclusion for the video either I'd end
up with a rock-solid product that I
could recommend with confidence
anyone who wants to listen to music
while they work out or I'd end up
getting to use the awesome punch line I
wrote about how I just spent the last
eight minutes mocking a jaybird a joke
that worked better in my head than it
doesn't practice guys like and share
