product from a company that no longer
exists well I have a very good reason so
NCIX still has a lot of these GS
450-pound they are still selling very
well and it's the return rates on them
are very very low so seems to be an
adequate quality unit it's at a very
aggressive price and NCIX is actually
covering a one year warranty on it
regardless of whether we're getting any
support from from bfg so yeah it's kind
of even though the company that makes it
no longer exists this product is still
out there and you can still buy it and
it does come with a one-year warranty
directly from NCIX which in some ways
especially if you buy it at one of our
stores is even more convenient than
having a manufacturer warranty for for a
year or whatever because then you can
just go right to the store and exchange
it if it dies so anyway there you go
this is the GS 450 power supply it is
the bfg power supply from there GS
series and it provides 450 watts of
power so let's go around to the back
where it says something along the lines
of efficiency meets affordability it's
definitely affordable although with the
later with the newest standards of 80
plus going up to 80 plus gold it's no
longer really a leading on the leading
edge in terms of efficiency in terms of
features it still is reasonably up to
date because you do have an 8-pin 12
volt connector you have a 24-pin
motherboard connector you've got dual 12
volt rails which is still pretty much
standard and you've also got a 6 pin
power connector to ensure compatibility
with many high-end graphics cards
without em knees okay well this is this
is bps unreliable often performance
hindering adapters yeah those don't do
anything bad anyway so you can read that
if you want pause the video if you feel
like it i'm just going to go ahead and
open up the box here are some more
specifications for you if you want to
check those out actually oh that's the
sorry it's the wrong language there we
go specifications so we've got 18 amps
on each of the two individual 12 volt
rails and you can see the rest of it
here so up to 304 watts total on the 12
volt rail so because this isn't using DC
to DC conversion like many of the more
modern power supplies you find that yeah
you can't provide quite all of the power
supplies total available wattage to the
12 volt rail we see included mounting
screws because even though like I said
it's a value power supplied is a full
retail box so you do get things like
mounting screws you get DFG power to the
people what's in here need help yeah
don't call that number doesn't exist duh
don't go there doesn't exist ah what
else do we have in here installation
guide that's still relevant and that's
all that's in there okay let's see what
else we got in here power cord that
still works even though bfg no longer
makes them and the power supply itself
here we go I always kind of liked to be
up to use power supplies I like the
overall finish of them I think they're
kind of nice they're not quite shiny
it's kind of like a matte brushed shiny
like it's almost like a hybrid finish
like I hope I can get you guys an angle
can you see the brushed pneus of it at
all in case so depending how you look at
it you get kind of a bunch of different
finishes in one very
fingerprint-resistant very scratch
resistant and I really like that because
something can look as good as it wants
when it's brand new but if it's just
going to look like crap as soon as you
take it out of the box manhandle it a
little bit and put it in your case well
then what's the point right you've got a
one hundred forty millimeter cooling fan
here on the bottom of the unit so make
sure that that's got access to fresh air
whether you're mounting it fan side down
or fan side up doesn't really matter
we've got the overall specs over here on
the side again so you can see those if
you so desire on the back we have our
little 115 vs. 230 volt inputs which
make sure if you're in north america
which if you're buying this from NCIX
which is as far as I know the only place
that still has these make sure it's set
to 1 15 please we've got our on-off
switch as well as our power inlet port
for wall power on the other side we have
nothing on the top we have nothing
and then let's have a look at the cables
hope I don't move this elastic is pretty
tight up and I'll break it and snap
myself here that'd hurt so basically
this power supply I wouldn't recommend
it if you're running any more than one
modern video card and even then i
probably wouldn't recommend it for
anything higher end then maybe like 68
70 something along those lines you don't
want to be trying to power up like gtx
580 on something like this so remember
with the 6870 one 6-pin PCI Express
connector won't be enough so you'll
probably have to use a so you'll
probably end up using an adapter with
two molex to another six pin in order to
run a video card like that and you're
going to be just fine that way so in
terms of other connectors ok so we got
our 6-pin PCIe we have a very very short
8-pin connector so either you're going
to want to make sure your case has a
top-mounted power supply or you will
need to buy an extension cable for that
so bear that in mind we have again a
very short 24-pin connector although
that'll be just fine for top or bottom
mount doesn't really matter how its
mounted from the top or the bottom ok
here we have a dual molex single floppy
pin cable next we have another cable
harness with two SATA yeah to say that
that's that's how old this unit is in
terms of when they designed it back when
it was like primarily people were
running like a couple hard drives and
then all optical drives still ran on IDE
sorta back when this was popular and
then two more molex here although once
again you can use molex to SATA adapters
there is no real drawback there so thank
you for checking out my unboxing on the
ever persevering DS 450 watt which has
outlasted the very company that
manufactured it don't forget to
