actually going to be something I've
never done before this is a sneak
preview of an upcoming NCIX PC
newsletter so our newsletter goes out to
all of our subscribers and it's an
official NCIX communication and this
particular one is going to be themed
around starcraft 2 as well as the GTX
460 so I've actually got a GTX 460 with
me today
this is MSI's g-force GTX 460 1-gig
cyclone OC card that means it has an
aftermarket cooler it is factory
overclocked and it's a 460 with 1 gig of
video memory and I just wanted to talk a
little bit about Starcraft 2 in general
so this article here actually if you're
not subscribed to the MC ixi newsletter
and if you're not getting the PC
newsletter there's about once or twice a
month you should definitely subscribe if
you go to NCIX and you go to wow it's
been so long oh yeah newsletters up at
the top then you can actually subscribe
to our weekly weekly specials and all of
our other newsletters so make sure you
do that anyway so this is going to be an
upcoming PC newsletter as a bit of a
joke we talk about the broodwar system
specifications required by Blizzard
versus the wings of Liberty recommended
specs and you know if you're not if you
haven't upgraded your PC since broodwar
you're probably going to be looking at a
bit of an upgrade here and we just
talked a little bit about what the
recommended configurations are for
Starcraft 2 so but really that's the
point of this video is what are the
recommended configurations for Starcraft
2 well there's two levels from Blizzard
and one of them is a fairly basic PC
basically the graphics card they
recommend is about 5 plus years old and
they're saying that's what it takes to
run the game and then they have kind of
a recommended level and we've positioned
a couple different pcs around there
minimum spec as well as their
recommended spec but really if you want
to get the most out of it I turn to my
friends at Hardware Canucks because they
did a terrific GPU roundup you can see
we've actually featured that here
because it is a third-party site that
really just took a whole bunch of cards
from ATI as well as Nvidia put
through the ringer on Starcraft 2 and
they came up with a recommendation that
makes a lot of sense and we're seeing
echoed all over the place the GeForce
GTX 460 it offers the best price to
performance balance it has good power
consumption if you get it with a good
aftermarket cooler it's going to be very
very quiet and it just kills in
Starcraft 2 because even though
Starcraft 2 will run on a five-year-old
card in order to get the most out of it
play an HD resolution turn up
anti-aliasing you will need a GeForce
GPU at this time to enable anti-aliasing
by the way but you're going to want a
fairly beefy graphics card in order to
actually run it at full strength so here
you can see the best i5 3200 sli is the
recommended config it has a GTX 460 in
it and then if you click here when you
get this newsletter it'll actually take
you to the Starcraft 2 GPU performance
comparison that they do on hardware
connects so this actually leads us to
our recommendation the GTX 460 1 gig and
and there's another piece of news that's
pretty cool is that if you're like me
and you missed out on the beta because I
would have loved to do some testing on
Starcraft 2 before release but I didn't
have a chance if you buy a GTX 460 after
the Starcraft launch you actually get a
coupon to try Starcraft 2 for 7 hours
with multiplayer so it'll have full
support for the game for 7 hours so you
can actually find out if you like it
find out how well it runs on your new
geforce card and then buy the game if
you're not entirely sure thanks for

newsletter as well as to my Linus tech
