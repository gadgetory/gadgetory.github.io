from this water bottle so we're off to
our sort of office update vlog part
three and I was like who wants to help
me film today and Ed was like oh I've
volunteer I'd really love to and I kind
of went okay let's go right I'm on the
motorbike today and even if I did have a
helmet I am quite certain ed zl-- would
not get on the back of a motorbike with
me so we're borrowing Brandon's car
which he was of course thrilled about
let's go
Kingston kc3 ten series SSDs feature
firmware based data loss protection
massive capacities and enough speed that
we use them for our 24 SSD raid 0 array
server click on this leaf to learn more
actually don't look too closely at that
leaf nevermind it's fine I think more
than anything else I'm just glad we're
out of the office right now because I've
spent the entire morning working on SMB
3.0 multi-channel and getting it to work
and the problem is I can't even figure
out how to do any research about it
because everything I find is like well
you just if you have to network
interfaces you plug the two into a dummy
switch and bippity-boppity-boo
you're good to go and it is not working
so maybe some encouragement will help
guys hit the like button if you think I
should keep working at this or if I
should just forget it and use single NIC
interfaces then hit dislike or something
because then I have burned so many hours
on fresh installs of Windows 8 and
Server 2012 r2 configuring LACP through
the switch and through the interfaces
configuring it through the Intel driver
vs. configuring it through Windows and
theory you shouldn't have to do it but
it the aggregation should work anyway
I'm glad we're out of the office right
now ok so since we're going to be taking
the trailer to the new office I guess
now's as good a time as any to load up
some of the freaking junk that I have in
my garage that needs to go there that
I've been accumulating over the last
little bit here
you know if I was smarter I'd probably
back the trailer into my driveway
instead of carrying these like this
little did Brenda know the greatest risk
of damage to his car was when I was
actually outside of it not when I was
driving it I'm not that close it's no
big deal
this is why you said and did nothing
that trajectory Oh
Silencio s 652 or 652 s sir whatever I
like them because they're quiet and they
have card readers and they don't have
they don't have holes in them from when
we started some harebrained whole-room
water cooling scheme okay these are
really heavy
you
okay these are our new chairs from max
anomic personally I'm into the dominator
myself but some people went for
different designs how many of these do
we have six that must be right okay um
yeah I'll have to do some more loads
another time I guess I did not get as
much in the trailer as I had really
thought we would okay so there you go
we'll take a load of stuff to the office
and have a look at what kind of progress
they've made in the meantime since we
started this load actually since the
last time we did a tour actually there's
one more thing we can take with us now
check this out and if I told you about
this we're actually going to do our own
personalized dishes for the new office
so that way without resorting to
checking the surveillance system I'll be
able to tell who it is that leaves
dishes out and makes the place messy so
I'm pitching this as a channel super-fun
where we all decorate our own dishes and
stamp our initials in our cutlery but
what it actually is is a way for me to
keep an eye on you lot so this is cool
on crap I forget what site it is
whatever anyway you can get personalized
forks and knives and spoons for like 20
bucks each or you can buy one of these
for $20 and you can do as many as you
want with a hammer so we're going to do
our own cutlery too so I just realized
I'm probably not going to be home when
Brandon comes to pick up his car
so let's find somewhere to put his keys
so that you know you can get them but
that someone else doesn't find them
yeah this could work safe
this is good news so if you look up over
the car there Fraser Valley
refrigeration is I think a tower unit
which means the HVAC system is
presumably being worked on which is
pretty exciting so as much as i trolled
my entire team and the entire internet
we are getting air conditioning for the
office in fact we're getting 2/3 ton
units one on the upper floor one on the
lower floor with like baffles to make
sure that the rooms that don't have a
bunch of computers in them don't get too
cold and all that kind of stuff so let's
uh let's go inside and see how things
are shaken Oh wah I believe this is all
stuff for the set which is just kind of
modular pieces of walls that'll go
behind us and then we'll we'll decorate
and move around the outside of the room
there is one oh my god there's a couple
things leaned against the wall like
apparently I wasn't clear enough with my
cones and my yellow rope to make my
point about not putting things on the
other side of the cones and the yellow
rope the good news is that this is
actually dried to the point where it's
much more difficult to damage now so I
won't have to have a brain tumor today
so one of the electrical outlets that I
noticed was missing is on the outside of
the library down there and apparently
our project coordinator is on vacation
this week I had no idea until I emailed
him today and then tried to call the
office and was told that he was on
vacation this week so hopefully they're
getting that and any of the other
electrical outlets that are not here
sorted out but there is a bunch of other
stuff that has made significant progress
so let's start upstairs so this will be
immediately apparent like upon first
glance but one of the big changes is
that the network cabling up in the
rafters of the warehouse has actually
been run so whether we're talking
security cameras or access points or
drops to other areas of the warehouse
like over there where we're
have like a little receiving thing all
that network cabling has been run
throughout the warehouse and is ready to
rock
also upstairs whoo look at that Wow a
lot is actually changed here so drywall
is coming in right now as we speak those
are the guys that are working right now
the window structure that I talked about
before is actually much more readily
visible now so you can see how it's
going to look you know not completely
enclosed on the upper floor now actually
if you come over here and just kind of
look out you'll see how you'll be able
to look out across the warehouse I don't
know how much of a view there's
necessarily going to be because Brandon
is probably going to want to shut all
those windows up there so there might
actually not be a ton of natural light
out there anyway but the way that I see
it it's still better than nothing
so in here this is going to be pretty
dark so the good news is you get an
office the bad news is you get like the
electrical panel that like buzzes and
makes noise and stuff and this like
massive like shutoff switch thing in
your office so yeah whoever sits here
will have to decide how they feel about
that that's gonna be the bathroom right
there
this is going to be the kind of the
slightly bigger office but not my office
no idea who this one belongs to yet I'm
trying to convince my wife to come work
for us so maybe I can entice her with
you get your own office this is going to
be the meeting room slash conference
room it's a little smaller than I had
envisioned it's a little smaller than I
had envisioned but we're going to try
and make some of it up by turning this
into kind of like like cushion sort of
place to sit so if someone's talking on
the projector wall over there or
whatever the case may be then extra
people can actually kind of sit along
here whoever can't fit around the table
so so my office is coming together
nicely um got the view out here and then
like it barely even feels like I'm in an
office at all right now to be perfectly
honest cuz there's gonna be a window
here there's a window there so it's not
about privacy necessarily it's just more
about having a quiet workspace where I'm
a little bit more difficult to interrupt
than I am now where it's hard to really
get any writing done half the time this
is where the people to the bathroom will
be installed now we wanted to turn this
space right here into a closet in that
office but something something planned
something something inspection
unfortunately we weren't able to make
that happen the good news is we ended up
with an unexpected little closet thing
here that I guess will turn into I don't
know storage for something like I know
moths or cleaning supplies in theory
we're gonna clean this place oh hello
great this is going to be a little
reception area so in theory we'll put
like a desk like kind of here and
someone will sit here and then there's
gonna be like a Linus Media Group thing
over here dbrand was gonna send us like
vinyl wrapped letters but they couldn't
get the the technical details sorted out
unfortunately that's okay no big deal
we'll find we'll find something else to
put there so this is another case of a
room that I really thought was gonna be
a lot
bigger than it ended up being but we're
just going to have to work around it so
this is the library and it actually only
goes from this mark here for the wall
into that corner so we're basically
going to have room for like a couch and
like a chair and so yeah well we'll just
like and we'll do our we'll do our best
with it this is the this is the plumbing
for apparently the kitchen I wasn't sure
what they were digging this out for last
time but yeah of course we have a little
kitchen unit right there where people
will you know make food presumably this
is a closet and then this right here is
the super weird bathroom that's actually
a lot of progress has been made here
they've taken out the supports that were
in the way of the door so this bathroom
is going to be hilarious like when
you're on that so this is going to be
the toilet so when you're on the can
you're going to be like sitting under
the stairs because there was a bit of a
floor plan issue also it looks like I
was indeed correct the ducting is going
in right now as we speak the drop
ceiling is installed that's all new
since last time I was here so the server
room is currently quite occupied by
things that's uh that's that's good I
guess so I can't really get in there to
show you guys the power outlets that
were that we're missing last time I was
here but apparently they are working on
now so that's good
we should have enough power in the
server room um so there you go I guess
that's pretty much the update for now I
don't want to jinx anything but we're
hoping to be moved in in the next like
few weeks here which I mean it might
take us a while to get our sets fully
built out and really get properly moved
in and get the work flow smoothed out um
but I'll write the ducting um oh I
really hope that there is this is a
ladder it yeah it seems to me I really
hope that the plan is to because this is
wow I don't know because this is above
the drywall here so they're supposed to
be exhaust in this room like
exhaust to the to the central HVAC for
the servers and then there's supposed to
be an intake on the door we interrupt
this program to bring you the Rockettes
taeyeon it is a gaming mouse with an
8200 dpi laser sensor and 14
programmable buttons which you will find
here here here here here here here here
here here here here here here and here
it has a right-handed ergonomic shape it
features their RGB a RGB lighting
configuration so you can light up these
bad boys right here as well as the mouse
rim so that goes around the outside of
the tie on it also with their easy shift
functionality allows you to have up to
two functions per button a pretty handy
dandy little feature right there and
this is actually pretty cool this is the
accelerator this is a linear one axis C
that springs back to centre a little
like paddle that your right mouse key
I'm holding with the wrong hand it's a
one-handed Mouse well not to say that
there are two handed mice it's just to
say that it goes in your right hand ah
which you can use for things like
throttle or really being anything else
that would require you know not just up
or down more like well you guys know
what these are for your gamers and I
guess that's pretty much all I have to
say about that so if you want to learn
more go ahead and click on this thing
otherwise back to you - so I don't want
to jinx it but we're hoping to be moved
in in the next few weeks or so so wish
us luck but I guess that's pretty much
