precursor to something I'm going to be
working on shortly this is how to clone
a hard drive so I'm going to start with
pressing the F lock because I have one
of those old Microsoft keyboards that
actually has an F lock button so I'm
pressing f11 going into my boot menu I
have three drives attached to this
system the first one is a DVD drive okay
inside there I have a copy of a
proneness true image 2010 and then over
here I have the two drives that I want
to clone so I've got a raptor 160
gigabyte hard drive and that is going to
be my source Drive and then I'm going to
be cloning that to a vertex 60 gig SSD
so I'm going to select the CD or DVD as
my boot drive and then it is going to
keep going and loading things won't take
too long there we go and we'll get right
into the Cronus trim oh look at how my
mouse is behaving that's very strange
I can't move side to side that's the
weirdest thing I've seen in a while so
I'll use the keyboard and just do that
there we go problem solved basically
what I'm doing this for is we did a tech
tips episode recently where we compared
a hard drive to an SSD and I had a
couple complaints that the comparison
wasn't exactly fair the drives that I
used were the vertex limited edition
from OCZ which is the fastest ocz vertex
SSD on the market at this time and then
the drive I compared it against was the
Western Digital one terabyte caviar
black which is a very respectable drive
by any stretch of the imagination but I
had a lot of people asking me well what
if we did it with a 10000 kr PM Drive
what if you used a lower-end SSD so
that's exactly the comparison I'm
prepping now I'm using that same image
which I've already cloned to the raptor
160 gig 10,000 rpm Drive and then I'm
going to load that onto a vertex 60 gig
which is again I'm much lower-end SSD so
we're going to go down to tools and
utilities click clone disk and we're
going to go manual mode then I'm going
to select my source disk which is disk
to the 149 gigabyte Western Digital
there we go click Next
and then I'm going to select my target
disk click Next
okay I'm overwriting a previous version
of the same image so it should be just
fine I'm going to use proportional and
I'm going to proceed it takes about an
half an hour and then I will be able to
shoot my little quick episode comparing
the vertex 60 against the WD Raptor ten
thousand rpm drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
