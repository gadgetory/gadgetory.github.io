from gigabit fiber Internet to 10
gigabit internet on our own dedicated
wavelength so behind this door is my
friends Danny and Chad from I tell who
are gonna be helping me with this little
upgrade by the end of which we will have
literally ten times the bandwidth that
we have currently to the main harbour
exchange in Vancouver with glass wire
you can instantly see your current and
past network activity detect malware and
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device use offer code Linus and
get 25 percent off at the link below
okay so step one collect Underpants step
two we need to look at these two
electrical rooms this one is building a
is that correct and then we also need to
take a look inside the electrical room
of building F because my understanding
is that maybe you could help find it for
me the main fiber connection to tellus
is coming into this building is that
right so here we found it this is the
Telus fiber optic cable that is coming
in from the street this is it's a beefy
it's a beefy boy but you can actually
see there's a reason for that
here we are so that right there is all
of the fiber strands that are protected
not just by this orange and blue
sheathing but then also by this thick
black sheathing around the outside so we
can tell three pairs so each one of
these is a send and receive pair but
that doesn't necessarily mean that you
can only have three fiber optic
connections running into this entire
complex of business units so one of the
pair's here has actually been there we
go run into this guy so this is a CWDM
and this takes a single ten gigabit
wavelength and then it is splitting it
out into ten one gigabit connection so
our old connection actually runs off of
this puppy right here and then we just
had two entire pairs that that's what I
would call dark fiber is that correct
just not doing not doing anything at all
so now aha you can see here the Linus
media group gets its own so we're
running off of three and four that are
dedicated just to us now we are going to
take this right here and we're gonna
plug in the one that's sitting up on the
top and instead of going into our
gigabit gear it's now gonna go into our
ten gig ear now you guys said this was
some kind of switch what was the brand
of it
so what this sienna switch does is it
allows I tell to constantly monitor the
speed that we're getting make sure that
nothing's going down there's no hiccups
or anything like that and then it's
basically just going to pass through
over to building F where it will then
carry over to our server room so to ISP
or data center guys who work with this
kind of stuff all the time I might as
well be making a video about a
screwdriver I suppose but for those of
you who don't I want to take this
opportunity because we're not ready to
cut over to this yet we've got to make
sure that the transceiver on the other
end in our server room matches this one
before we can go ahead and just pop the
fibers in I wanted to show you guys
exactly what kind of gear we're looking
at so this is a long haul 10 gigabit
transceiver so our fibers go in here and
then they are converted to copper
signals that your computer or your
router or your switch in this case can
understand and there's all kinds of
different types of these things
everything from 10 kilometer long range
to 40 kilometer long range to short
range ones to ones that are designed to
carry a single wavelengths the ones that
are designed to carry multiple
wavelengths and the main difference for
this one is that it's going to be laser
rather than LED which is what you'd
normally use for just like one of the
cheapo ones you get off eBay just you
know running from your server room to
your you know editing room or whatever
else and the strength of the signal so
it's super bright because it's designed
to go over very long distances you want
to make sure they're not mismatched
because even if you have two long-range
ones if you've got a very long range one
and it's too bright for the distance of
the cable you can actually get
attenuation so it's all dark magic to me
but it's pretty freakin cool okay so now
we're headed over to the electrical room
of our building where honestly nothing
really happens other than that it's just
like spliced together basically is that
right yeah okay so this is a good
opportunity though to explain the
difference between having your own
dedicated wavelength and having your own
dedicated fiber run so even though that
fiber that's over in building a is going
to go all the way out to the road
and to tell us his nearest like like
what would what would that be called a
splice point it's going to be combined
with other pairs over there it is only
that light wavelength that is actually
dedicated to us along that path and that
path is dynamic like if if someone's you
know digging a post and cut something or
whatever it's gonna get automatically
routed around but it's still pretty much
a direct path tens of kilometers away to
harbour center and what we're expecting
to see is somewhere in the neighborhood
of ten gigabit per second in about one
millisecond of latency so you guys
actually had one of your texts did I
overhear someone around a benchmark and
what are we looking at from your switch
nine point eight gig well where's my
other point to you bastards
yeah can you can you okay all right you
want to explain it no you don't want to
explain on camera all right all right
some something about TCP test see this
is the thing about Internet service
providers you know there's always an
excuse there's no there's overhead okay
so now we're over in our building so
building a was the first one of this
complex so that's where everything comes
in from the street that makes sense so
we've got one black cable here we go
that comes all the way up here and then
into little bits be like a splicer box
like what would you call this
sure I'm calling it a splicer box but
he's a splicing cabinet maybe anyway so
you can see here all our fiber strands
are separated here and this would
normally be closed for protection and
then it's going right there we're the
only ones in this building with fiber
internet obviously and then our yellow
one goes into this orange sheath and
then all the way back down here to unit
102 so 101 102 103 and 104 are all linus
media group but that's where our server
room is so now we're gonna go over there
so now we're in our server room where
that orange sheath that we saw in the
other building comes in from the top and
then it comes in the back of our cabinet
and plugs into this guy just a patch
panel okay cool so then we're actually
going to continue to use this exactly
the same way we used to is that right
now the one extra piece of equipment
that we had before that we will no
longer need actually is this MRV right
here which was essentially a media
converter so we were taking this fiber
out of our fiber patch panel and then we
reconfigured this guy so that we could
run this copper connection into our
pfSense router which is actually over on
the back of our rack so this just goes
away and I get a you back yes good
fantastic
so then Danny basically what you need to
check is if these are long-haul
transceivers or short-range ones is that
right not these my new transceiver which
ones that
yeah it's just an SFP+ port so there's
no transceiver okay yay okay so I've
gone up the menu and I think I know
which ones there I think it's igb zero
or one I don't know which though so
we're just it's gonna be a little bit of
trial and error here so next step then
is message everyone and tell them the
Internet's going down
Internet going down warning and five
four three two one so I tell tells me
normally this is a two-person operation
so you can just like both move them at
the same time but we want it to film it
we only had one camera person available
so I guess everyone gets to sit inside
in the dock of no internet they're both
doing things look Danny's plugging in
the other one so there we go so what
have you moved over okay
so that old one gig hardware is
technically all still there the one gig
circuits still up in parallel then we
tear it down
got it theoretically over on the other
end we're ten gig okay so theoretically
I should see like some kind of LED
indicator on that if it's working I
guess right nothing so far so there's
six rj45 s and two SFP+
okay so worst-case scenario there is a
PC is PCI Express expansion slot on this
thing and we definitely have sfp+ cards
that is definitely showing iuck so did
they just die what is this
the ARP request cannot find matching
address what is that even five reboot
the system
yeah let's reboot normally so while it
was booting up IX 2 &amp;amp; 3 showed as all
the devices were initializing so they
exist they're just not showing up in the
list I think the problem might be that
for LAN interface I entered I Excel 0
instead of I Excel 0.1 shouldn't matter
well it's still freaking out about that
10.20 dot 0.74 nonsense I'm rebooting on
the bright side we have a link now
that's good Thank You Danny
let's thanks Danny no Pellow there's no
update holy crap I think it actually
kept the configuration from last time
look at this when is IXL 3 it has an IP
okay so when interface you guys want to
have a look at this it appears to be up
okay so we're not sure exactly what
happened but the latest update is that I
tells guys are seeing our MAC address
what is that Anthony why did you have
those why are those deprecated what our
Internet's up
God got lag killed today so let the
record show I actually did know what I
was doing I just didn't know that
someone had tampered with my spoon and
sort of knew what I was doing okay I
could have checked this before they got
here what was happening was two of our
eight interfaces just weren't showing up
in this list because there was a link
aggregation group setup that was showing
up but we didn't recognize because we
were looking for IX l3 so everything
that I thought was supposed to happen
with everyone arguing with me where I
was like no no a blob blob now it will
show up and all this stuff and Dada blah
blah blah the only thing I did wrong was
I bummed out plugging in the fiber so
that it wasn't lighting up since then
it's been I mean there's a there's an
element of user error you know what I'm
sure all the network admins in there the
ones that aren't telling us that pfSense
is totally unsuitable for 10-gig are
telling me why I'm wrong but anyway the
point is you know what Ben it's working
all right so what we want to do now is
ping our gateway and see if we're
getting the advertised one millisecond
ping times so you're at 50% here Danny
50% oh yeah oh you're blaming my router
now oh I see how it's gonna be so we can
actually see here whether we should
blame my my router or not it looks like
our send time is point three
milliseconds and then our round-trip
time is right in the neighborhood of two
milliseconds there so we can see that by
refreshing it here it's really
consistent dang so it's all working
we've got Internet but one of the
coolest things about our sub two
millisecond round-trip time to Harbour
Center is that we could basically have
direct layer two access to anything else
that's in there so if we want it to
connect directly to a CDN or if we
wanted to put our own servers in there I
mean I guess that's probably expensive
but theoretically we could do it right
we just have a 10 gigabit pipe to Harbor
Center
that happens to be bringing us Internet
now the way you explained it to me we
basically have five and a half gigabit
to the broader Internet
but ten gigabit to anything that's at
Vanek's is that right or harbour centers
okay five gigs of Internet five and a
half six with overhead so all that's
left now is to run a speed test but we
have a slight problem we're gonna press
go and we're gonna discover that speed
test relies on the server at the other
end having the amount of bandwidth that
you are testing for so we just maxed out
someone's gigabit server somewhere
because the reality of it is if anyone
had a multi-thousand dollar a month
internet connection a 10 gig connection
they'd be using it for something it's
not just sitting there waiting for me to
speed test I mean apparently it's got
more down than it does up which is
fascinating but poor urban fibers like
well what are you guys doing to me right
now
so now what how do we test this thing
what even do Danny multiple sources I
mean you know what Oh a torrent a
torrent could work well I wouldn't know
anything about torrenting Danny you know
what I'm gonna call two and a half gig
up ok for now and I'm just gonna do like
a fun test ok because technically Google
is in harbour center right so why don't
we upload something so slight correction
Google is peered there but either way we
should be looking at some pretty serious
speeds here 2.6 gigs
let's upload it to YouTube week week
YouTube your week all right we're gonna
have to find something else like what
can we what can we like hit with this
I perf test yeah I need that running on
the thing remotely so basically there's
nothing that we can do to test this
other than hand this connection over to
the floatplane guys and give them a
server here in our server room and then
do like a live stream or something so
maybe that's something that we'll do in
the near future and see how hard we can
hit this thing in the meantime though
massive thanks to Danny and the I tell
folks Chad coming out here and helping
us hook this up massive thanks for the
discount I guess it wasn't that
substantial still very expensive but
they claim they're not making any money
on it so you know you know it's the word
of an ISP so they're pretty nice guys
but yeah I don't know and a massive
