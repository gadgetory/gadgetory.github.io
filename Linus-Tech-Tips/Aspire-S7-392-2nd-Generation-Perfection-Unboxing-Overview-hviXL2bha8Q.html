learn more welcome to one of the
unboxings that I am most excited about
we've actually got quite a few products
in the unboxing queue right now but this
one yeah this one jumped the queue
because I am stoked to check it out
now I saw this already once at Computex
2013 but this is the next generation has
well based a sir aspire s7 392 now you
might be saying - really you're getting
excited about an Acer notebook no that
was the old Acer the Acer that didn't
build things that were absolutely
drool-worthy for a long time I was
afraid that if I needed a notebook I was
going to have to buy a macbook because
there was no one else building anything
that was very compelling not true
anymore
the original s7 has been my companion
for the last few months but I did have
some complaints about it number one
battery life ain't that hot you had to
use an extended battery life to get what
I'd really consider to be acceptable
sort of seven to eight hour maybe nine
hours sometimes battery life out of it
not that impressive it's also quite loud
the keyboard has an extremely short key
travel which you have to kind of
understand because it's extremely slim
and the touch pads a little bit finicky
alright
all of those complaints they're
addressed so this is officially in my
mind at least from sort of from my usage
case because I don't need the power this
is as good as it gets for me so ah okay
let's open this up so first of all it
comes with a little sort of you know
fake leather e carrying case so this is
looks like it actually hasn't changed
since the last gen there you go
side-by-side comparison looks pretty
similar alright next up we've got a
little QuickStart guide whatever Windows
8 okay if you haven't used Windows 8
before I do actually recommend checking
it out we've got the notebook itself
which is actually
slimmer than the old one even which is
kind of cool the power adapter has
actually been changed quite a bit
so it comes first of all with these the
final run the thin DC wire that goes
into the notebook itself which has been
altered so the older one had a very
fragile connector and a very sort of
small plug this one has the same small
fragile connector but a slightly
different shaped plug so that much has
been changed at least also the shape of
the power brick itself has been altered
too so it comes with little adapter
pieces that you can go ahead and plug
into that as well as into the wall piece
here which is quite large
the older one just had a standard wall
plug so not quite so bulky and it had
more of a flat-pack style power brick
the only problem I had with the old one
though was that this was didn't connect
very well at least on my sample anyway
so it sometimes would come out but at
any rate so they've changed that sort of
more tubular design alright and that's
pretty much it in terms of included
accessories there's a Quick Start Guide
your windows Khoa and then on to the
notebook itself so the old one actually
included an extended battery because
Acer must have known that the battery
life just wasn't good enough on its own
the new one does not need to include any
such thing so ASA uses Gorilla Glass on
the top of the notebook itself they're
actually the first ones to make Gorilla
Glass anything other than aesthetic as
far as I can tell with the original s7
so Gorilla Glass offers improved rugged
ability less are more resistance to
damage from things like flexing or
dropping or scratching anything like
that then let's go ahead and have a look
at the overall slimness so they've
actually made it slightly slimmer
although when I pulled out my 391 at
Computex and held it up side by side
with the 392 it was awfully hard to tell
so here let's go ahead and put them side
by side by side there I'll they actually
kind of start to add up in terms of
weight once you start stacking them like
that so anyway there you go so it is
slightly slimmer than the old one it
uses the same aluminium unibody design
which in addition to the Gorilla Glass
gives
it and not strength that you can't
actually you can actually flex the thing
too much in spite of its slimness and
the hinge is what they're calling their
dual torque hinge so I actually do
really like the hinge on this notebook
so you can see it opens up slightly more
than 180 degrees which I did find myself
using from time to time so you know just
walking around holding it like this it's
almost like a tablet in terms of its
lightness as well as in terms of its of
its size so it's a 13.3 inch display
it's 1080p in North America however it's
2560 by 1440 by default in Europe you
lucky dogs which I would love to have
once we open it up we actually find one
of the other upgrades so right here I
hope you guys are able to see this but
I'm not sure you'll be able to but the
keys have a deeper travel so the
aluminum around the keyboard is actually
indented whereas on the old one it
actually was indented but it was much
less so that gives a more satisfying
tactile response to the keys in fact you
can hear the difference and they have
also revised the touchpad to be slightly
less twitchy when you are
double-clicking or whatever else you can
also see that because they've reached
the battery life target set up by Intel
the Ultrabook branding is now on the new
s7 whereas the old one was not
technically an ultrabook even though it
was a very very slim notebook it uses
the same il backlit keyboard so it only
lights up in situations where you need
it and it has a very satisfying blue
glow and in terms of Io they haven't
really changed much to speak of so over
here we've got mini display port as well
as HDMI full size HDMI oh that's oh
that's kind of cool okay they've changed
a lot this is better one USB 3.0 port on
this side a headphone microphone combo
Jack then over on the other side we've
got a an SD as a card reader now oh no
the old one have a card here okay okay I
forgot about that
another USB 3 port the on/off switch as
well as the power input they've changed
the cooling but I can already tell the
new one runs a little bit warmer
the old one so basically acer has tuned
the cooling internally with what they're
calling their twin air cooling design
and because Haswell has lower power
consumption because Haswell does run
cooler
they've also tuned the fans to be
significantly quieter but it seems like
it does run a little bit warmer
particularly here right in the middle of
the back the back uses a plastic
composite material where you're going to
find two stereo speakers as well as air
intakes and other than that it is
extremely clean and simple looking just
like the old one except that I have that
add-on battery pack sort of strapped on
there in terms of other upgrades to the
specs so yeah it has well you can get it
with either a 4200 U or a 4500 u but
they've also got either 4 gig or 8 gig
ram options they've got a raid 0 SSD
it's funny to me to see manufacturers
moving towards raid 0 because it's just
I mean it decreases reliability however
with solid state storage it's less
likely to be damaged in a drop or
whatever else like that like there's
kind of arguments for or against but
raid 0 is a more complicated
configuration and it is not something
that I really feel that strongly
positive about to be perfectly honest
but either way it's got raid 0 in either
a 128 or 256 gig configuration and it
will give better performance
particularly for SSDs and b-roll is
leaning on my thing there it's got a
dual array mic now so that means it
should be able to pick out your voice
when you're using it for voice
communication or video communication or
whatever else and it supports why I now
so Acer is quoting a seven to eight hour
battery life for this guy which puts it
right in line with where the old one was
maybe a little bit below the old one
with the weird bulky battery wart that
sticks out of the bottom so there you
have it guys the notebook that I
personally like more than anything else
that's out there don't forget to
subscribe to - tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos let me know in the comments what
you thought of the video what you think
of the Aspire essence by rs7 392 is this
the new Acer that you would consider
using or can you not sort of lose them
in your mind as sort of that commodity
machine builder and last but not least
like the video if you liked it and
dislike it if you disliked it
