welcome to a long-overdue unboxing of
cooler masters side in 120 XL and side
in 240 M liquid coolers now the first
thing I noticed about these is check
this out
cooler master has gone ahead and put
compatibility for LGA 1150 right on the
box now it should be noted that LGA 1150
which is for Haswell or Intel Core i7 i5
and i3 4th generation processors is not
really going to be any different from
1155 or 1156 in terms of heatsink
compatibility but I mean it's just one
of those things where it's all it always
amuses me when there are coolers being
announced and being shipped that have
compatibility for an upcoming socket
when you actually can't buy said sockets
yet so the main difference between these
two coolers is going to be in terms of
the size which is a little bit funny to
me because the 120 is the XL and the 240
is the M which in terms of North
American sizing usually indicates
extra-large and medium whereas the 240
millimeter one is definitely extra
larger than the medium size 120
millimeter one so let's go ahead and
check out what Coolermaster is done in
terms of packaging here so these are
liquid coats are pre done liquid cooler
so actually a few fine we'll start with
the outside so they are maintenance-free
they're designed for overclocking they
use an ultra fine micro channel design
for the CPU block itself now what you're
going to see right here guys is that
this is not an ace attack and it is not
a kulit design so Coolermaster has
wanted to differentiate themselves from
what the other guys in the market are
doing and they have done that by well
not doing what everyone else in the
market is doing which is sort of one way
to differentiate yourself from what
everyone else is doing on the back you
find ultra fine micro channel so pretty
much the same a hot durable and powerful
water pump dissipates heat effectively
and maintains temperatures throughout
the stable water circulation all that
kind of good stuff ok so let's go ahead
and start with the 120 in terms of
what's inside
we've got some foam on the top we've got
mounting hardware which we will be
unfamiliar with because it is not the
standard ace attack or kulit mounting
hardware so let's go ahead and see what
we got here I love this nice solid
pieces of everything see see solid steel
mounting plates so there's your AMD
mounting hardware at any rate all right
there is your Intel mounting hardware so
you can see that screw is able to adjust
in position see moves over clicks into
place just like that we've got a
backplate for Intel so this pops in two
different positions as well so it has
full compatibility for 775 1155 156 1152
1011 1366 all the sockets you could
possibly want and AMD because they
haven't changed their mounting hardware
and like a bajillion generation just
pretty much the same as before same
thing here nice solid mounting screws
these ones look like they're for LGA 200
it could be for a number of different
things but okay there you go again more
solid pieces here so it looks like the
way it mounts is the backplate comes
through the board goes into one of these
guys and then the cooler itself mounts
to that piece from the other side from
the top I like this system there's a
number of different coolers that have
used it in the past and I find it's very
solid very sturdy and works very very
well they've also included a splitter
for the two fans so there's a PWM
splitter which is awesome because it
means that you can provide PWM control
for both of the fans without actually or
yeah without actually having to run one
of them off of DC and I mean honestly a
lot of motherboards might have all the
PWM and connectors in the world on them
but it doesn't always work correctly so
there you go
it's nice to be able to split the CPU on
a lot of the time they aren't
controllable to the same degree of fine
mattoon as the one for the CPU connector
is so this is a nice touch Coolermaster
includes a couple of 120 millimeter fans
and they also include a couple of nice
rubber isolating mounts for them so you
don't have to worry about any vibrations
being transferred to your case and
causing your computer
louder than necessary these are intended
to be installed in a push-pull
configuration because if you set them
both to push or both to pull you're
going to have yourself one heck of a
problem this radiator is optimized for
its sort of I guess I'd go sort of
mid-range in terms of do you have to
have higher rpm do you have to can you
get away with low rpm because the fin
spacing isn't particularly dense which
is great for low rpm quiet operation but
it is a thicker radiator than you find
on most 120 millimeter coolers meaning
you'll get a little bit more performance
out of it but you also have to have a
little bit more static pressure to the
fans in order to draw the air that you
need through it you can see how
coolermaster fills their water cooler so
there's a little warranty void if
removed plug right there that shouldn't
get in the way of anything because once
you go ahead and install a fan on it
it's not really any higher profile that
a fan would be and they're using a
quarter-inch corrugated plastic tubing
approach that has been in use for well
years now on these prefilled liquid
coolers and I haven't really been any
notable problems with them there's also
a rotating fitting right here so you're
going to have the flexibility to mount
it either sort of this way facing down
or if you rotate those like that yeah
this way facing up just like that
it uses aluminum fins for the radiator
itself but there are copper tubes as
well as copper tanks and a copper bottom
for the block itself you can see they're
using a security bit here I actually
have one of these so I could take it
apart if I felt like it but they're
using a security bit to prevent users
from taking apart the unit which is not
what it is intended for it is meant to
be maintenance-free
and not opened up or anything sort of
bad like that all right so let's have a
look at the 240 millimeter version we've
got two of the same fans
it looks like the noise isolating rubber
mounts are not included at least on the
fans themselves yes here they are so
those are included instead in a very
heavy I love heavy mounting hardware it
makes me just feel that much more
reassured about it so there are a couple
of them in with the rest of the mounting
hardware where there's thermal compound
just like the 120 millimeter version a
fan splitter just like the 120
millimeter version and then just more of
the same mounting hardware so this is
for instead of having it in two separate
bags it looks like they've done just one
bag for the 240 ml version the radiator
itself is a thinner style radiator so
you're going to see this one is I'd say
mid thickness for the 120 mil and then
this is more like standard thickness and
then there are some that are actually
larger and thicker than this one but
those are those are much more rare than
these ones and that's for compatibility
reasons not all cases are compatible
with the thicker style radiators this
one in order to make sure that it gets
the performance it needs uses a much
more dense thin arrangement right here
so you can see that it's all about
surface area guys so if you have a
thicker radiator and you use a less
dense thin arrangement versus if you
have a thinner radiator and you use a
more dense tint arrangement what you've
done is you've actually in both cases
increased the resistance to air passing
through but also increased your surface
area and improved performance so
generally speaking the less dense the
more optimized it is for low rpm fans
and the thinner it is the more optimized
is for low rpm fans whereas if you were
to put even double the density in here
and put like you know jet turbine fans
on it you could squeeze more performance
out of this form factor because surface
area is king and that's why the 120 dual
120 millimeter version will perform
better than the single 120 millimeter
version so you've got that same fill
point here at the top that says do not
tamper with or remove please don't do
that same corrugated plastic
quarter-inch fittings or hoses as well
as the same rotating fittings down here
at the bottom attach to the same block
and pump combo this is why I did these
unboxings together we've got a copper
plate at the bottom that looks
what's flat anyway it's hard to oh no
it's bowed there you go I wonder if the
other one is as well you can tell if you
look at them in the light just right yep
they're both both so what that does is
it increases contact pressure and
reduces temperatures as long as you
design a mounting mechanism that's
rectally sort of optimized for so if you
have a CPU here and then you have a boat
so this is flat and this is boat and you
have a boat surface and then you clamp
it down what can happen is you can end
up with two flat mating surfaces whereas
if you take two flat mating surfaces and
you clamp this down a lot at the edges
you can end up with a cavity in the
middle we discovered this or must have
been back in around 2008-2009 DTEC
figured it out with their bode block
that they were putting o-rings in in
order to to blow out the base of it and
get a tighter mounting point so there's
a little water cooling history lesson
for you
cooler masters using a very high quality
sleeping on the connector so the pump is
powered by a three pin that you really
can't see any of the color of the wires
inside I like this it's a nice touch
makes you build look nice and they
include of course detailed instructions
Coolermaster has been doing liquid
coolers for and just coolers in general
for a long time so I wouldn't expect
anything except nice detailed
multilingual instructions for every
possible socket and everything labeled
and all those sort of good things done
it looks like the same instructions for
the 120 or the 240 millimeter don't
