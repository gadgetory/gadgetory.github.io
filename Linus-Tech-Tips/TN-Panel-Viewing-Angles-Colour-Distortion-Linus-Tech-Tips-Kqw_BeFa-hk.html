film something where we showed off the
benchmarks that we ran for far cry 3
where we had a g-force vs. radio on
showdown hold on you're going the wrong
way when we were using this monitor to
showcase the graphs and I was like slick
you got it you got to use like a more a
more obvious like a darker blue on the
graphs because you can't really see it
on the monitor so here this is the angle
that I was looking at it from I was like
yeah these aren't going to show up how
are we going to show people what the
graphs look like and then I got down to
eye level with it and I was like up okay
that is a perfectly acceptable blue so
the issue appears to be the TN panel
having such horrendous viewing angles
that it was pretty much unusable so just
for lols
we took an IPS panel this is an a pro
art monitor so for contrast this is a
120 Hertz TN which is about the
worst-case scenario for a TN in terms of
color accuracy and viewing angles
because of the way that they have to
overclock the panels in order to get
them to respond so quickly and then this
is a color calibrated 60 Hertz IPS which
is pretty much the other end of the
spectrum so we'd love to get some
different angles on here so slick come
on over here and get them from sort of
the side so you can see that what is
supposed to be down down down what is
supposed to be blue actually appears to
be brown and and yeah I mean the
difference is so is so stark even going
from sort of like a viewing spot of
about here to about here that there is a
noticeable noticeable difference if
you're not looking exactly straight on
with the with the TN panel so you know
guys if you don't believe what I say
about how TN panels are for colour
reproduction as well as viewing angle
just so inferior to their to their pls
IPS and VA counterparts hopefully this
is a bit of an illustration for you of
what would be a worst case
scenario so what is a TN panel like this
good for a couple things number one is
3d you cannot run 3d unless you can get
120 Hertz refresh rates and unless you
have a fast enough response time to
prevent any motion blur or around run
motion blur well motion blur as well
because that can wreak havoc on 3d
gaming as well as crosstalk between the
left and right stereo images so you have
to have a super fast panel the other
thing that a fast panel is good for is
2d well ok 3d gaming but not stereo 3d
gaming where you need that you need that
responsiveness from the monitor you want
to have that extra edge compared to
someone else who's using a 60 Hertz
monitor because it will actually show
you the image faster so if you're
playing twitch games where you need
every last millisecond then this would
be useful and if you're running in
stereo 3d then this would be useful
otherwise do yourself a big huge favor
and I get an IPS ba or pls panel because
I think you guys have seen what the
contrast between these technologies
looks like again a very extreme sort of
version of it thanks for watching Linus
