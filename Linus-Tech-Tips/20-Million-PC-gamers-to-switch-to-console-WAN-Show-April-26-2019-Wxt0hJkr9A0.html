hey welcome to the wine show ah sorry
about that
so you know what this is what happens
when I leave you in charge Wow I think
that's the only reasonable explanation I
think this is what happens when you
leave the line effective screw as
responsible for anything technical
pretty much ever no I think this is
there we need to stream something well
that's fine well just uh you know we'll
use a Streamy cart instead of our
streaming PC that's dedicated but never
works and it's needed a reformat for
months that's no big deal this is roll
this over and then not set up an audio
solution if this is what happens when I
leave you in charge yeah any of the
software needed to make thumbnails or
pretty much anything at all we're live
you know what's hilarious is we actually
did a sponsored livestream for this
product it's called the go XLR Kasab's
and it just completely saved our bacon
because we didn't have the drivers for
our focus right thing on the one stream
machine and then we had this we've had
this ongoing issue with the other one
where it just hasn't been stable like
we've been dropping babies for some
reason very weird ways yeah so basically
I I blame Jake I really want to turn
these headphones okay that was easy
yay and oh oh they actually I shouldn't
oh I need to know I need to know if the
swear button works hey Luke so we're
gonna find out if that work oh boy we've
got a great show for you guys today it's
gonna be a little late it's probably
gonna do a little short because I have
big news I am finally starting the
interviews for the writing position for
Linus tech tips actually the couple of
writing positions that we're hiring for
so I've taken me a long time to get
through all the applications there were
a freaking ton of them I
actually not all the way through but I'm
stack up and read what I'm at mm well
people must want to work okay so the way
that I the way that I got a couple
hundred was that in order to even make
it to my inbox you had to raise a couple
hundred got to you a complete sample
script okay okay oh yeah oh yeah that I
was like I was like there's something
we're off every single one of them has
already invested hours into their
application at least assuming that they
expect to have any chance whatsoever Wow
yeah yeah it makes sense
I'm interviewing anywhere between
anywhere between 15 and 20 of them I
thought you meant you got that many like
resumes oh yeah well we didn't even
accept resumes until people answered the
skill testing questions okay and then
once they submitted their initial
application we sent them back a package
that was like here is all the work that
you have to do in order to even apply
and I mean the idea is like you're
trying to filter out the people that
just write that into it right up that
seems like a lot of work well you know
what working here's a lot of work so you
did that to me I did yeah I actually I
had to find that email I'm not even
gonna go into why but I had to find that
email recently I would love to know why
us tag stuff I had okay yes this I had
to figure out this part was easy I had
to figure out the names of all the
employers that I had from 2010 to 2016
so I had to figure out when I started
working with it yeah god it wasn't an
employer relationship but they're still
interested in that right and I had to
figure out when I was working at Canada
bread factory whether or not that was
whatever that doesn't matter the next
thing was I had to figure out all of the
entry and exit dates of me into the u.s.
between 2010 and 2016 it's funny cuz
like 2010 packs 2011 tax 2012 packs 2013
everywhere 2014 a complete mess after
that the first few years were so easy
and then
Oh buster Oh anyway so let's get into
some tech news that's kind of our new
year's resolution for the land shows
first and then we will we'll talk
because we got stuff to talk about
actually um yeah I that the coolest
project ever
oh yeah really don't miss this video
because it's it's it's really cool
anyway I will oh yeah what are we doing
yep for Nate's success like two months
of crush time at Epic Games uh 20
million PC gamers projected to switch to
consoles by 2020 to modify have anything
to say about it and to the 2021 Intel
roadmap has potentially leaked alright
let's roll that intro assuming that it's
here oh oh boy oh is it boy it's at the
end uh I don't I don't know if it's
playing should wait price that this is
not visible huh
it is probably just white oh is it not
transparent
wait but order move up no no I would
just maybe go to properties and restart
it properties oh wait no not loop loop
should work no restart restart playback
but yeah no this should be right no no
no it doesn't that's yeah probably
doesn't have it man no okay ah brought
to you by madrina a coach dropping it oh
wow no none of these are working not
dying in a swarm that's not working
brought to you by displayed moss and
madrina is that oh boy hey oh boy the
setup loose our lower third isn't here
either perfection
yeah our lower thirds not here this is
this is great
um you know what it's fine that's wait
no this is mad this is not even hahaha
is the intro gonna work yeah so you know
that stupid thing where you've got a
network drive and it's just X Tov
even though
soon as you double-click it like zero
latency boomer goes right in all I had
to do was do that and I bet the in troll
play okay hold on it's on no no mmm
that's not working well we got part of
the way there
pre-order a water bottle LTT store comm
yeah all right let's let's get into our
first big news of the week for tonight's
success led to months of crunch at Epic
Games now you know some people in the
game development industry don't you okay
so let's first let's talk about what the
situation is like in Epic Games and then
why don't we talk about what we know
about working in the games industry in
general and okay so basically this was
originally posted up by polygon and was
supposed to be Luke 7 inch on the forum
and in a nutshell
fortnight's explosive growth like the
thing is every game company hopes that
their game is going to be the next
insert you know pub G that bejeweled
it's something that tangles something
that like really explodes and they're
basically just printing money anyway but
that doesn't mean that they're
necessarily prepared for it and the
thing is is that you might think okay
well you built the game now basically
it's all gravy then right tune but it is
not that simple and for tonight for
Fernet in particular for a couple of
reasons number one is as the game scales
their infrastructure has to scale in is
that even in a linear manner or would it
have to scale there more probably scaler
more especially because they're gonna
get attacked right yeah furthermore
because it's a free-to-play model game
it's not like you just ship it burn it
to a CD put it in the mail to the
customer and you're done especially with
for tonight they're releasing new
content they're editing the map they're
doing all this stuff constantly so
basically what what the what the report
says is that for tonight's explosive
growth led to months of intense crunch
and intense crunch is no like the gaming
industry is no stranger to intense
crunch when you're coming up again
a major patch or an expansion a big DLC
or I mean of course the launch of the
game when we were at monolith they were
saying that like the number of people in
that studio then when they were working
on DLCs and stuff was nothing compared
to the number of people that were
crammed into that place in the weeks
leading up to the launch just finishing
up all those last-minute things but
normally that doesn't happen
indefinitely with no light at the end of
the tunnel so they're saying it led to
months of intense crunch for epic
employees and contractors some of whom
said they felt extreme pressure to work
grueling hours to maintain for tonight's
success and profitability resulting in a
toxic stressful environment at the
company I also believe only contract
staff were paid overtime so while
officially voluntary working overtime
was basically like an expected service
to the company this is this is what is
being reported at the very least now
contract staff say they were paid
overtime but some employees reported
suffering health issues after working
consecutive months of 70 hour weeks I
mean put that in context assuming that
you're working five days that would be
14 hours a day you're basically going
home collapsing in your bed getting up
and going to work and you might say well
yeah all you do is sit at a computer
well for one thing no not necessarily
yeah I mean that monolith in particular
did you know that they actually have
their game developers go into their
motion cap room and like apparently so
that's actually super cool I know right
yeah yeah yeah so the reasoning for that
is because they don't want the armor and
stuff that they can't be wearing during
the mocap to clip yeah so the game
developers know that so they'll like
change things to make it work super cool
and so mocap actors wouldn't be able to
compensate for like I'm like this jacked
dude doing this move you know how do my
muscles not clip on my other giant
muscles you know so they can make sure
that they do it and some of them were
actually like really good you got
training yeah so I bet you they did
specifically for that so yeah those guys
don't specifically sit at a desk and
furthermore sitting at a desk is
mentally fatiguing in a way that people
who haven't had a desk job might not
actually when you're fat I'm solving all
day and creating things all day so this
is a quote from one employee I work an
average of 70 hours a week there's
probably at least 50 to a hundred other
people at Epic working those hours and I
know people who pull 100 hour weeks just
like okay the company gives us unlimited
time off but it's almost impossible to
take that time if I take time off the
workload falls on other people and no
one wants to be that guy so back to what
we were discussing about what the what
the free-to-play model means for game
developers in general games as a service
sort of creates this constant refresh of
deadlines it's kind of like working here
so you launch a video at noon that day
or whatever and it's like you pressed
live and you're like okay major
technical issues how's the audience
sentiment okay
crunch time is all the time and the
biggest problem is that they're patching
all the time the executives are focused
on keeping fortnight popular for as long
as possible
because I'm sure that they're smart
enough okay not every executive is smart
enough but I'm sure I'm sure they have
an executive that's smart enough I'm
sure Sweeney knows to know that no game
stays dominant forever it doesn't happen
that's not a thing that exists so it's
all about making hay while the sun's
shining if you can make 3 4 5 billion
dollars on just 18 months of popularity
that's your chance it's not like you can
pace yourself and be like ok we're gonna
take it easy we're gonna make our 2
billion dollars and then we'll make the
other 3 billion dollars down you might
not get a chant you know it might not
get a crack at that so we're not allowed
to spend time on anything if something
breaks a weapon we can't just turn that
weapon off and fix it in the next patch
it must be fixed immediately and all the
while we still have to be working
next week's pageant and you think about
like how disruptive that would be to
your workflow like for example like a
real-time operating system for example
if you have like that's why if you ever
wondered why you click something
sometimes in Windows say and your click
doesn't register and you go well like a
click is the simplest thing ever
how is there a delay on that it's
because Windows is not a real-time
operating system those do exist they're
mostly for embedded systems things like
medical devices and for things like that
where timing is absolutely critical when
that input happens the response is
triggered but what that means is any
other background processes boom that
interrupted done you're done and for
something like something complex like
Windows it doesn't work that way so you
can end up with a significant backlog in
anything that's going on in the
background if you interrupt it
that's exactly so that's why anything
that you know normal people interact
with just can't work that way because
it's so disruptive it's a bad bad
analogy terrible analogy I actually
don't care the point is getting
interrupted sucks yeah I feel like you
just are really into real-time operating
systems yeah how far well how far off
was I I mean Oh on that no it was
finally now just fine yeah good I just
felt like I went too far into them I
feel like you kind of like made it work
but it works thanks yeah thanks bro yeah
no worries
um speaking of making things another you
make that shirt work thank you you can't
see my nipples there's a little weird we
were kind of you know like low nipples
then another thing that I noticed in
here is it says that contract staff were
paid overtime it specifically says that
right so I suspect salary staff were not
paid overtime that being said I do
suspect in all fairness that the salary
staff are gonna be getting wicked
bonuses especially with fortnight raking
it in I hope so
you might hope that but it's not always
a guarantee so epic did make a statement
people are working very hard on
fortnight and other epic efforts extreme
situations such as 100 hour work weeks
are incredibly rare
and in those instances we seek to
immediately remedy them to avoid
recurrence but they are acknowledging
that someone might work a 100 hour
workweek yeah on what planet does that
make any sense even at your worst I
don't think like you would have been
anywhere near that I've been over that
when really really early with the Titan
launch and the forum at the same time
okay right okay so okay it's been very
infrequent whatever and that was you
also didn't tell me - it's mostly me
being like I want to do these things so
that was fine I'm not complaining to be
clear I didn't know that you worked that
many hours that week anyway salaried
positions and actually just so you guys
know we work salary here at Linus Media
Group so salary positions do come with
the expectation that from time to time
you're getting it done with that said
the flip side the the employers side of
that sort of arrangement is for the
people that put in those hours for the
people that are the the star pupils in
the class hey there's some kind of a
reward for that so that it reflects back
or there should be a bonus actually
something that that time should be
recognized in competitions everything
everything should be recognized and
dealt with accordingly now the other
thing that is just kind of a you know
usually you won't find an employment
contract or anything but the other thing
that we see as part of the
responsibility of both the employee and
the employer is making sure that
everyone's being reasonable I'm
communicating about stuff so we'll see
people working too many hours sometimes
and we'll say hey um good job gold star
appreciate the effort obviously I'm not
gonna tell you off for it um thanks but
like hey maybe you should go home and
spend some time there
you know especially for it so one thing
I'll throw and I've been doing a lot of
interviews lately and people been asking
me about the work culture that we have
because that's a big problem in the
software development industry right as
we're talking about literally right now
but we just got turned off hey it looks
like like kind of dramatic yeah that
back on is is very few people have left
- me feel like we're like being
interviewed I'm cool with it this feels
like 60 minutes or something I'm down
I'm into it yeah do it sweet but yeah
like very few people have left and I
think that's a culture that - media
group and floatplane both want to
continue and in doing that you don't
really want to abuse your people all the
time both planes have some pretty brutal
crunches I like to think that they
weren't super long but there have been
some pretty brutal brutal crunches
there's like sort of one going on right
now with with especially one specific
guy on the team but his thing is almost
done and he's pushing through it's gonna
be good
yeah you guys are still in like very
much start-up mode I mean the thing is
is like it's yeah it's it's complicated
because on the one hand you know the
people work really hard and that's like
amazing but on the other hand we are
like Yvonne was telling me the numbers
for how far underwater we are on the
project I was like oh cool
the good news though and this is this is
really exciting is sorry dang it we're
doing floatplane news again I swear
we'll do a real tech topic after this
yeah the good news though is that you
guys are how close to launching the new
transcode and just very close it's been
like supposed to be out this week sort
of maybe every week for the last while
but there's been with very legitimate
reasons that it's been delayed right and
we're trying to release something that's
good and stable and stuff right now it's
like the majority of its in prod just
not activated and there's just like in
prod means it's on the production server
like yes live yeah it's just not being
used it's there though and it's ready
they didn't I mean hasn't really been
turned on but it didn't break anything
which is great and we're like extremely
close to putting alive it just the
confidence level
isn't quite there and there's a few
little problems still to be cleaned up
so yeah I'm getting to the point where
I'm like thinking of reaching out to a
few people specifically and being like
hey you might want to get ready cuz
we're there and the good news is once we
start bringing creators on the situation
should change very very very quickly
just be hemorrhaging money yeah we've
seen I mean I wouldn't call it
hemorrhaging the project has been
running for two years yeah and like the
bleed rate keeps going up you know which
is kind of not the direction you want
that to go in but it's sort of it's
hiring people though which is like the
problem by the teams in a really good
spot right now I'm really happy with
everyone that's on the team and I think
we're doing great things currently and
if I didn't do that and we didn't hire
more people and start losing more money
I think the project would be in a way
worse spot and we'd have like never
launched kind of issues we should talk
more about like some of the some of the
like milestones that we've hit in the
last little bit like during the during
the roast anyway but first we're gonna
do some more news topics because we owe
you guys that so here's an exact speed
on the on the forum and it's based on
some a john petty research TV gaming
market study so according to their
latest report more and more PC gamers
will probably shift to consoles for a
couple of reasons one increasing GPU or
graphics card prices to the inclusion of
PC specific features like 4k and ray
tracing in next-gen consoles including
keyboard and mouse support variable
refresh rate and high refresh rate using
HDMI 2.1 streaming surfaces services
like Google stadia and the new all
digital Xbox 1s they're saying the
coming of 5g will only bolster this new
segment that I am sort of wondering what
the
um and they're saying that the majority
of this will come from the low end so
under thousand dollar full build cost so
in my opinion this is this is almost
moot I know there's a difference yeah
but we're getting the the more we
progress the more they're just fairly
cost effective pre-built pcs that are
limited to only doing certain things and
like literally everything that he just
listed like yeah I can use that keyboard
and mouse variable refresh rate it's
like okay it's computer thank you
so I guess what you're trying to say is
at what point do we just call it PC
gaming and stop pretending yeah I see
like I I'm actually going to try to
defend that argument a little bit
because I think it's more actually
phones and laptops and stuff that are
actually causing this change if
PlayStation games store what like you
got your steam yeah you play oh just put
it on the PlayStation that would be
amazing
why don't we just not lishus that would
be the only game store that I would
happily invite you know like every game
so it's like oh another one like why
don't you suck around and just call it
what it is yeah call it a computer give
me a graphics options like do it heck
yeah Oh that'd be super cool I remember
laying into that number forever ago
when I had my like console drive idea oh
yeah yeah you take like an old console
and just like insert it into the front
of the computer and you want it to like
mod it so that it you could put like a
nest like a nest classic or like nest
minier like some kind of thing into it
and then the controllers were gonna be
hooked up into like the thing in the
back or something right yeah it there
was I had that idea of just doing it
myself actually but the reason why I
came with that idea was cuz what I was
like pitching pseudo pitching was that I
wanted them to make like basically super
premium blu-ray drives for PC that were
just branded Xbox and PlayStation that
just random freaking games through your
own computer so it's just a DRM scheme
yes Hardware deer whatever you own
everything whatever look I'll pay I
so have you ever pitched that on wine
show before yes this but this was years
ago I didn't even I didn't even remember
that exact but that mace was either
garage or like early old house it still
makes so much sense to just because
compared to pings know how much just a
one ask cost anyway like I think a 1x is
like 400 bucks or 500 I think I want us
just like 350 I want to say can't
remember um
300 bucks or 1s but 1s isn't even the
newest one right okay but no I just mean
the basic one so the 1s isn't that is
the basic yeah so would you pay 250 for
a DRM drive that just slips on the front
of your thing and then you can play my
do Microsoft is moving towards making
Xbox games Microsoft is starting to sort
of solve this so a ps4 Drive ps4 Drive
honestly I probably would cuz there's a
huge amount of ps4 exclusives that are
super cool I borrowed the the works ps4
for a fairly long time I had it for over
a year I forgot we even had one I like I
like own a decent number of ps4 games
because there was a lot of a really cool
single-player RPGs that came out on ps4
God of War was amazing I remember that
might have been on both consoles but
there was also a bunch that were
specific I could be wrong I think God of
War might be both but there was a number
of ps4 only ones that were also
supercool never played a God of War game
would like to just play that one just
the first one no that's not me no
there's like rebrand it's just called
God of War but that's the newest one
okay it's super super good Oh like a
reboot kind of thing I think so
Tomb Raider it's quite different than
the old guys as far as I know I didn't
play the God of War Games all that much
the old kenji the uke is asking for an
update on the bottles so if you ordered
one in the first I think it was 500 then
it's either shipped or shipping very
soon because those ones were actually
sitting in the warehouse ready to rock
yeah
if you're one of the hundreds of other
people who remember guys there is a
message on there that says it's a
pre-order
those are on the boat now
otherwise we wouldn't have taken
pre-orders we wouldn't take pre-orders
on anything that's not shipping now so
those are on the boat now they should be
here in about three weeks if they are a
little bit later I apologize in advance
I'm sorry we are actually really new to
the whole physical merchandise thing
we're trying really hard but there's a
learning curve actually did you know
that Lloyd is in China right now yeah
yeah so he's he's running around at a
bunch of like major like manufacturer
affairs and he sent me back pictures of
some sandals obviously we would
customize them like like balls out
customize them but would you wear an LT
team answer yeah see I was telling I was
I was talking to my wife about it sorry
you know my wife you guys all know her
name I forget I can always forget that
she's like hosted teklynx yeah I was
like out there so good I was talking to
be fond about it and she was like I
don't know sounds like what don't you
know like a dad sandal yeah oh man have
you awesome and and people are like yes
yes socks would socks is are gonna
happen this go there's going to be a
call this is not shipped yet nevermind
I'm not gonna talk about this
that's um he's gonna be a combo also I
was wrong it's a god of War's only on
PlayStation so there's another example I
knew a gaming thing that we got a play a
no again this is fun so we'll talk about
it later okay you know what sponsors
done will do one more news topic and
then we can actually talk about stuff
okay so we need to talk about Anna we
need to talk about the streaming the the
roasts we need to talk about what else
was like stuff we actually wanted to
talk about yeah alright we'll do one
more topic one more topic and then we'll
jump into the news so Intel's 20 21
roadmap apparently leaked so this is
over on hexxus net and apparently
tweakers on net claims that these
roadmaps came from a dell presentation
earlier this year so on mobile we're
going to be looking at comet Lake
h-series offering up to 8 and 10 core
processors on 14 nanometer 14
ooh 14:10 core on mobile what the whole
thing is really fun wait comment like
each do they mean like the like the the
mobile age chips surely they couldn't
that doesn't make any sense no that no
that's got to be that's got to be
consumer hold on a second I got to bring
this up that can't be right that cannot
be right okay here are the pictures a
little small it's little tiny you might
want to open it says click to zoom but
it doesn't work
thanks Texas you tried all right you
series H holy balls that does actually
appear to be the plan ah yep that's 45
watt to 65 watt BGA that is a big
problem holy balls that apparently
series oh sorry sorry guys
thanks for Pinscher my bad
wow that seems like a terrible plan yeah
especially have you seen well they're
just kind of screwed right now have you
seen some of them to use mobile stuff
lately mm-hmm they actually have some
legitimate looking mobile devices coming
down the pipe like we've got one from
Lenovo on the shelf over there for a
review that we're like wow this is like
a sexy AMD laptop in a long time hey
never mind long time
never when did AMD make any sense in
Mobile Terry on you're kidding me but
it's still gonna drive me nuts I oh yeah
it's been extremely long time I
I remember like even when I used to work
at Best Buy way way way way back the AMD
options were the cheap crappy ones in
terms of laptop I've had time desktop
they're actually pretty easy but yeah
oh sorry people are people are upset
about what we were saying when we were
looking at the other roadmap basically
10 cor 14 nanometer it's nuts because
there's there's no power savings or like
a nominal one so all they're doing is
just stuffing more power-hungry cores
into this thing so all they're doing is
playing around with the turbo boosts and
hoping that the notebook manufacturers
can figure out how to cool the bloody
things I could be wrong and someone at
Intel might be able to explain their way
through this but it feels like they're
trying to throw some interesting numbers
out there to keep people buying things
while they try to figure out their
manufacturing process problems it seems
that way but like apparently they just
don't think they're gonna have it
figured out why like they've got 10
nanometer stuff coming but only you
series so H series is not getting any 10
nanometer until at least 2021 that's
nuts
that's um that's funny who's this Frodo
Nuggets on the on flow plane says you
guys should make a holy balls shirt we
did a long time ago happily and there's
a cat on ya probably won't happen again
didn't it's all very fun no that's what
happens when you catchphrase kind of
sucks
speaking of actually we're speaking of
actually where that do you guys like
having this whole thing or would you
prefer I got a mirror up here just this
logo but like over here okay so for
context we've discussed it internally
this was the plan this was the design we
all agreed on yeah and then we got it
and we were like it looks a very
internet startup
it really does it's straight out of
Silicon Valley yep hi wow people are
saying they love it but remember this is
like let's chat maybe we should probably
talk to YouTube chat
we need an objective analysis of the
design here Wow YouTube chat moves so
fast I should be doing straw bull see it
through do strong yeah you know what why
don't you prepare straw pull well I lied
it's the logo in the corner and how it
is now those two options yeah sure okay
alright yeah let's just do two options
Oh
so today's video is brought to you by
mas backpacks
oh hey where's my backpack Hey look at
that I don't even have to use the
sponsor here's my backpack I like it I
use it all the time I think that's a
pretty good I could afford a different
backpack but I don't because I really
like this one this is the old one it
doesn't have all the features of the new
one but um I like this one better
actually I don't I just like the color
because the samples they send the new
ones are black so yeah so this is the
new one it's black it's all stealthy
it's the black pack but it's the black
pack black pack yeah a backpack I don't
see where they were going with that
backpack this is it like do you think
they intended it to be a pun oh maybe
cuz it's a backpack that's black whoa
crazy anyway they also have the Grande a
version of it that fits up to a 17 inch
laptop they're made out of 300 nylon for
the exterior and 1000d nylon for the
interior for water resistance and the
black pack fits back laptops up to
fifteen point six inches they're made uh
that one's made of ballistic nylon that
gives it abrasion and tear resistance
it's got a built-in rain fly to provide
extra padding for your electronics when
not in use
that doesn't make any sense but whatever
it's good I like it
both of them come with mounting for the
water resistance reach C reach plus
power adapters and a five-year warranty
can get the resin off their current
stock until it's gone
limited quantities at the link right
there um I'm pretty sure the rain thing
is because I used to have one is a cover
that you take out and put over your bag
but that doesn't provide extra padding a
separate talking point that oh the
package oh I bet you what that is
is when you put it back if it's not
raining and it's in the bag it probably
provides padding got it
just don't get used to just throwing
your bag down yeah when it's in there
and then have it on it'd be a rainy day
you put it on you toss it also brought

alrighty then alright so do we have any
other news topics that we have - uh that
we have to do
I don't think so this is pretty cool
Vega finally beats our TX folks again so
this was posted by blue jay 6:14 on the
forum the original sources WCC F Tech
AMD's rx Vega 64 apparently outperformed
the r-tx 2080 by up to 20% in the Vulcan
enabled game World War Z the benchmarks
were conducted with the overclocked Cora
9
900k at 5.2 gigahertz this is to
eliminate any possible bottlenecking
it drives me freaking crazy when people
in the comments flip out about you guys
are using overclocked CPU your results
aren't realistic okay the reason is that
you're trying to alleviate bottlenecks
elsewhere in the system so you can see
the maximum potential difference in
performance between the components
you're actually trying to test anyway at
1920 by 1080 with Vulcan enabled AMD
managed to take all three top spots with
the tradie on 7 Vegas 64 liquid-cooled
and Vegas 64 and the Vegas 64 outpaced
the r-tx 20 atti despite costing half as
much NVIDIA closed the gap at 1440p at
4k there still isn't blah blah blah blah
blah basically it's one game if we were
to take like Intel's performance in
counter-strike source as like an overall
indication of intel's dominance in
gaming performance we would be silly
because cued yeah we skew you know what
Intel outperforms AMG by like 30 40
percent it doesn't actually yes yes
source yes go yeah may or may not be
specifically the Vulcanus of it I mean
it's an it's a neat headline that I'll
probably wouldn't read too much into it
if you know if you have seen that
headline until we start seeing Vulcan
across a broad sampling of games giving
AMD that kind of a performance advantage
yeah I probably wouldn't read too much
into it
LTX yeah what about it
there's less than 40 BYOC tickets left
so if you want to bring your own
computer and show up at the event and
have a land center thing and all that
kind of fun stuff
give freaking ticket cuz you're running
at a time also volunteers they want
people to apply to volunteer I believe
that's in the description down below if
you want to check that out if you're not
on Twitch and they will be getting back
to current applicants in May if you're
wondering why you haven't received a a
response yet and also if you bought a
ticket and want to volunteer they'll
refund your ticket
oh really cool apparently so the way
we're structuring things is that either
an lmg member or brand partner will be
managing the overall operation of a
booth and then volunteers will help as
needed to make the area a success so
we're looking for between 60 to 80
talented volunteers in total we've
already got twenty shifts will be either
one eight-hour day and then with one day
to enjoy the show or a four hour shift
each day and then time to take part in
the Expo for the other half of the day
duties will include scanning tickets
handing swag out recording entries
answering questions directing people
building pcs disassembling pcs running
around watching stuff and more I'm sure
all volunteers will receive free
admission as described BYOC not included
the LTX merch pack shirt pen lanyard
meals during your shift reference letter
from us for your help and of course our
undying gratitude gratitude never dies
just becomes undead apologies to the
volunteer applicants that jonno and
Colton interviewed a few weeks ago we
will update you guys in May once we have
a firmer grasp on so many people we need
for each booth there we go
um yeah man it's happening soon yeah
our team is coming out we've got a lot
to do
I'm so excited I am so stoked especially
because some of the special projects
that LTTE has been working on in order
to have them there add LTX are starting
to come together so oh you try you tried
one today that I hoped was gonna be
pretty cool like like 25% is cool I
would have hoped it would have been 25%
is cool um so basically Jake
mostly jake has been working on a
first-person view the idea was okay so
it came it came from racing games are
fun and a couple of the really amazing
experiences that we've had at LTX in
previous years where we lugged 16k
gaming to the first one and then when we
did the ultra wide version the 10k
gaming one we we brought that one as
well and we we hooked up racing games
which was pretty sweet it was really
cool ultra wide one with the racing
wheel and the like big screen experience
unlike anything most people will ever
experience
but the bezels
the bezels and it's all virtual it's
just videogames so next-level stuff
happened in the LTX 2019 and this video
is gonna be freakin sick we are we were
using first person view racing goggles
okay so these are for drones typically
but people have been known to hook them
up to RC cars and RC cars and we want to
build will not want to did build the be
like IRL racing game cool oh my goodness
and it's like I don't even know why it's
so different from what it's playing a
video game but it's very notably
different we both expressed similar
things about how just the fact that it
is actually real seems to impact you a
lot more and the learning curve if you
know how to drive super fast zero you
just you're just like oh I'm driving the
latency is incredible so you see I sent
over their fpv racing goggles just just
unbelievable so I've experienced so a
delta X so the first part of the video
is gonna be like the proof of concept
which we finished today the second part
of the video is going to be dialing it
in getting four of them going yeah
building a track it's gonna be a jump
there's got to be a job if we don't have
a jump then we failed yeah well we'll do
our best to have a jump cool um so so
we're gonna build a track and then we're
going to do it as more like a
step-by-step guide okay so guys if
you're into this sort of thing and you
just have unlimited money lying around
cuz you're dead mouse or something
here's how you do it step by step to
build your own fpv car complete with
racing wheel and pedals and brakes and
all that kind of stuff it's it's pretty
it's pretty crazy what are the craziest
things for me is I in VR games I don't
get the effect like if you play a
roller-coaster game I don't get to like
whoa I should be feeling Jesus I go
around this corner
but driving that little car you like you
feel like you leave really feels like
you're trying to lean into the corner so
like hey oh man ramier ism is like
surprisingly very and when you're
playing on a monitor you never feel like
oh I just need to like peek around this
corner yeah but I was moving my head
constantly even though there's no head
tracking in this yeah oh man that was
wild super super cool super fun um I was
not expecting to do that today it's so
much better than I expected
oh well sweet what else we got going
they grow different topics that's fine
who needs topics anyway I know yeah I
need to upgrade my freaking computer yes
I was hoping you're gonna bring that up
okay I love the original a no game the
computer for an oh I'm sorry it's so
laggy so I loved the original a no game
over here in North America it was called
1602 AD and I played that a ton as a kid
like they're different release way too
much and in Europe it was called a No
okay yeah it's a German game Oh actually
yeah it was like one of the first German
games to really break out on an
international that makes sense because
when I look up things for it there's a
lot of German forms which I was kind of
surprised by that's interesting like the
amount it's sold in Germany compared to
the population of Germany relative to
the rest of the world it's like like
basically everyone and apparently it was
close to 50/50 male and female that's
cool yeah because the thing with a know
is that it's low pressure gameplay
almost nothing is not reversible mmm
so if you kind of go down the wrong path
and you're not successful or whatever
does regression oh all right it's not
like that so anyway I I picked up the
new a no game cuz Luke was over he's
like oh yeah I got it
jonno got it Colton got it and I was
like oh poor pressure I guess I better
get it's like $80 Canadian ridiculous
anyway so I got it fired it up and on my
you know super nice still monitor what
whoa yeah look what happened you can see
it the OBS capture is delayed talk watch
your mouth move hello okay what really I
don't know okay are we is it bad
apparently lose audio do you think I
don't know how much oh okay it looks out
of sync slightly to me okay yeah I can't
do anything about that rain just go with
it
just go like this okay so now won't
bother yes no no yeah so so anyway so so
yeah so I got it and Luke was over so
he's never played a nano game before
yeah but you had tools around for like
20 minutes or something right
played for less than an hour and I had
watched like the part of a starting
guide video okay got it
so basically as someone who had actually
played the game before I was surprised
at how applicable my knowledge was given
that it's been like 20 years since the
first one or something stupid like yeah
I know even one of the really
interesting things to me was I watched
you play the original one for a little
while and even stuff like certain
buildings I was able to perfectly
recognize because they like I don't know
I've seen some reviews obviously didn't
play the other ones but I've seen a lot
of reviews refer to it as like a return
to form and all this kind of stuff and I
think they really tried to go back to
the roots of that exact game that you
happen to be playing at that time right
which is kind of hilarious
but but yeah it seemed to work out um so
anyway I so I fire it up on my still
pretty nice monitor so hundred Hertz
34:40 by 1440 and I'm getting like I'm
like Luke you know it's weird because I
find like the menus really laggy so I've
got g-sync which means that it's a
little harder to pick up on like frame
rate fluctuations but I was probably
running a like 45 fps
or or less it probably or less probably
dipped below that I'm just blow that on
average I they get dipped below 30
probably I think so that was it was
pretty bad and there was certain like
there were yeah there were certain
interactions that were specifically very
difficult because of the frame rate
which is wild it was kind of a powerful
to watch so um so so he's like yeah what
kind of hardware you running in here I'm
like not Titan X Maxwell so something a
lot of people might not realize is that
I had that well and you were running at
ultra wide and great settings and all
kind of stuff yeah well I tuned it down
a fair bit when we played multiplayer
the next day and like forty but not like
45 okay I just broke this dang it why do
I fidget with pen things this is a
stylus anyway um so yeah a lot of people
might not realize this but in the last
seven years I have either had an infant
or a young like company to deal with and
I haven't had a lot of time to play
games I know in particular is a massive
it's it's a black hole that consumes
time itself I think I think it's even
though it's real time I think it might
rival Civ yeah like it's pretty crazy
especially if you kind of take your time
with things yeah and the multiplayer I
couldn't find any way a way to change
the game speed so we were playing at 1x
game speed which I the income felt
pretty slow yeah well are you also just
like weren't as good at it as me
wow there's that Wow wasn't it further
ahead whose Islands better wasn't I
further ahead further ahead of what I
had money population yeah tech I had
money okay yeah wins a game to get a
strong amount of citizen I was actually
I was actually being nice to you I had
the artisan class like five minutes
before you said anything sorry sorry I
said it's in the grand scheme of
homais it was not very much and I
probably got more of them when I got
them yeah but you probably also ran into
a bunch of trouble where you didn't have
any workers for your friggin factories
that's who was always buying stuff from
your warehouse which I realized I think
nobody might further was the terrible
idea she was just built with it does not
make it better it's not like you're
better at all I should have kept all of
that I have now learned that was not a
favor in the slightest
oh did you or did you not need the money
I did that's not my fault thing well I
should have Jenny I should have just
built worker houses to solve the problem
and I'm like a recurring basis whatever
man it was fun though and then I thought
my bill my apartment building lit on
fire and then I had to run away space
monkey says Linus good at a game what
you know you mostly you joke about it
quite a bit yeah oh actually I played
apex on stream today the problem is that
watch a little bit of it the problem is
that newer games genres are a bit of a
problem for me
so if I am dropped into a battle royale
I don't even think that's true it
depends so apex Legends has a lot of
gameplay elements or a fortnight for
example the whole building thing where I
have to you know can't do the building
thing at all yeah I'm turbulent yeah
like I I have to completely learn like a
new skill set and play the game because
of the building and and my my whole
thing is like I don't mind learning to
play a new game but I don't really have
the time to learn an entirely new genre
because by the time I sit down and sort
of fumble my way through it meanwhile
all the kids that are spending 30 hours
a week playing this game know the entire
map and every element of the gameplay
like the back of their hands by the time
I fumble my way through how to like play
it at all because I just don't have it
down and yeah it's like a kids crying or
or something I get interrupted
and then and then I can't I can't get
back to it I've got to do some some job
interviews or something and there's
those weeks later I look at it again I'm
like I kind of forget exactly how to do
this so if you just drop me in a pure
shooter okay like I won't know the maps
and that sucks but like I can get some
kills I'm fine I can click heads no
problem if you drop me into something
where there's you know very realistic
recoil for example yeah I do have
trouble with that but then a lot of it
see the problem with a lot of that I
think what it's coming down to is I'm
not trying to year horn but it's it's
time investment with a specific mechanic
where like with recoil a lot of games
that have heavy recoil you need to learn
the recoil of that specific gun yeah
so that just takes time like you'll
learn patterns of recoil stuff and all
that just takes a huge amount of time or
even like research cuz you can just look
like something that counter-strike you
can just go find resources that'll tell
you okay as soon as you start holding
down on an ache a much like a 7 yeah
draw yes like in a certain speed no it's
good it's and like because pub G didn't
we win our first two games that you ever
played yeah yeah one the very first one
I don't know if we won the second one
too but we want another one that night
yeah and we only played three or four
games and we want you did what are you
pretty good I did do some damage though
you did some damage and in pubs you in
Apex you can bring people back and all
the kind of sub healings a lot easier in
pub G it's not and you were alive till
the end and you were making calls and
you were landing shots like it's it was
the first freaking game you ever played
and you were doing damage that's
honestly I think you did better in those
first one to four games than most people
that I play with right are actively
playing modern games it's just that you
don't have a lot of time investment yeah
again I'm not trying to your horn and so
the thing is like if I have the
prerequisite skills already like pub G I
found really a lot like playing
paintball yeah yeah okay so like the
tactics were 100% there yeah it's just
that I don't have but like I need
someone to like tell me what ammo goes
in what gun like I'm not I'm not an ammo
head I don't know like oh yeah like an
MP was you've got to get this caliber
thing I didn't know what scopes fit on
anything or whatever so as long as
people
like tell me okay yeah picked that one
up okay yep sure okay how do I sorry how
do I mount the stock put this okay sure
as long as I don't have to learn the
gameplay mechanics then like honestly
it's not that bad and RTS games I
actually played a lot more than FPS
games when I was growing up I was like a
Warcraft 2 kid I played way too much
like you want to play Warcraft 2 with me
I will slay you probably I promise you I
was to you I will slay you and your
friends I played Warcraft 3 though no
problem
let's do you work ever so Warcraft 3 is
a funny one I actually played it a fair
bit the summer that it came out in
French because I was on I was on an
exchange to Quebec for like my thing and
the kid that I was skiing with got it
and Warcraft 3 was a game that was way
too demanding for my home PC to run at
that point fortunately so what I did was
right so I played a fair bit of it in
front so I mean a I know all the like
stupid I probably played it more in
French than I did in English um so
anyway when I when I went home I spent
all the money that I made that summer on
building my very first gaming PC and I
used the term gaming PC pretty loosely
it had GeForce graphics GeForce 4 MX 440
yeah chipset graphics but it was good
enough to run more craft 3 so I actually
bought myself a copy of that which was a
lot of money for me at that time least
60 bucks the brand-new game and I played
it like a fair bit I played the kit but
I mostly played campaign I just I never
really got into the competitive side um
but I'm good for a second yeah if you
want to play some Warcraft 3 again I'll
put some Warcraft 3 my brother and I
decided to download it for fun yeah
there's still an active component sure
there's a very act all Blaser games
never like we my we downloaded some maps
there's I don't remember exactly what
it's called so sorry but there's a
website that you can google very easily
it's like frozen maps or something like
that yeah or war war maps I don't member
but you can download maps and you can
host games and they will
Phil like immediately like there's a
very active player base that is ready to
go into games the thing that is tough
about games that have been around
forever is that masters yes everyone's
like really good I didn't play supreme
commander for like four or five years or
something stupid like that and then I
tried to drop in on the FA forever
community and I was like yeah I probably
still know how to play this game dead so
key mechanics have changed a fair bit
like I didn't like forged alliance I
really preferred vanilla Supreme
Commander I didn't like how fast the
commanders were all of a sudden instead
of being like highly vulnerable they
were like these speed demons and they
were more like combat units instead of
like Builder units and I was like oh
well I thought that was the whole point
of the game was that he was or she robot
I don't know
was that your commander was very
vulnerable so I just I didn't really
enjoy the gameplay and I was at a time
when my life was starting to get busier
and they added another race and so I
didn't want to learn to play a new race
and I didn't know how to deal with the
new race so there's that problem like I
was talking to someone but Kyle recently
but how it's like a mastered game yeah
win it when it comes out it's going to
be kind of problematic so I was like oh
you get a PvP I'm like no this was an
interesting conversation that we were
having actually last week because I was
I assumed you were gonna like please no
classic Wow
yeah and I I I will play it I'm sure I'm
gonna be poking around the community and
seeing what's going on I don't know how
deep I'll get into it purely because of
like a question someone asked me was
like are you gonna go into PvP it can be
really fun to have like an older wow PvP
setup it's like well yeah but I play a
warrior so I'm just gonna get tooled
because all the like very abusable
mechanics of certain other classes are
going to be very abused because everyone
knows what they are and like warriors
well that's great because we're gonna be
super crazy overpowered as specific
things in PvE sweet but that's also kind
of weird
right it's not the same like back back
in the day you and your group had to try
to struggle through this thing that
nobody really knew anything about and
the default gear that you think you
should take is actually crap and all the
good gears like blues and greens and all
this weird stuff and now everyone knows
the perfect thing all the time no matter
what and there's there's no thought or
experiment that really has to go into it
right everything's all perfectly not
well what you were calling it was a
solved game yes like in the same sense
that like tic-tac-toe is a solved game
yeah so yeah I think you were telling me
that there's basically down to like how
long to hold the button for the
direction that you walk like the fastest
way to level up to level 60 as autopilot
and it will tell you exactly who to talk
to you exactly where to walk everything
right everything and it will just like
the minimal number of clicks basically
basically together and like that's not
that's not what it was like
that's not gaming No so that's gaming
the system I'll play it because I'm sure
my dad my brother will play it and it'll
be cool to hang out with them and stuff
but but you might have more fun if you
found people who have never played Wow
to play with almost certainly if they
don't dive super hard into online guides
right just like try to play fairly
ignorant right which is and you just
kind of play along yeah right which is
kind of weird in its own right if they
release Burning Crusade that would be
great because Burning Crusade as far as
I know is not solved in the same way the
classic is people want your straw poll
for the shirt ah yes I do have that
let's see if your screen cap works oh
not exactly what I was hoping to see
because I was hoping a more skewed poll
would show up yeah this is pretty uh ooh
that doesn't really tell us a solid
answer no so um all right then thanks
guys
one thing that I have a problem with is
like the the logo also doesn't look
completely a hundred percent like chill
if you know what I mean looks like a few
corporate yeah if you put the logo in
the corner it's still gonna look like a
corporate business shirt
yeah but if you took off the logo and
just did the word mark then it's
Facebook if you hadn't told me that I
would never have seen it but other
people we're a very different blue blue
it's pretty bad
it got pointed out by one of the members
on Steam i believe he's yuki and like ii
he said it I was like yep it starts with
an F it's white text on a black s not by
much it is different it is different but
like you know what forget it
let's just leave it the way it is people
who love floatplane and want a support
floatplane will get one and people who
don't well to be clear there's not gonna
be very many yeah they're all can be
like handed out at LTS it's not like
this is like an LT t-shirt design where
we're like printing a thousand like that
I think it's a hundred and fifty and of
that one hundred and fifty there's like
allocation to LMG allocation to
floatplane employees allocation of
creators so there's like really not
gonna be very much because we don't
suspect people are gonna be way too into
it people want to know when they can buy
them I don't know if we will put them
for sale I think we're you were you're
gonna have something LTX or something
but I don't know yeah that's the only
plan right now I think we see it as
mostly like a promotional thing like
yeah get away yeah all right do we have
anything else somebody wanted to talk
about today I don't think any official
news topics yeah okay um alright so I
guess that's it
cool see you again next week same bad
time same channel bye guys
that button stops working yeah then
we're in a we're gonna have a real bad
all right this doesn't work okay we're
just gonna stop alright that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
