alright guys I know many of you out
there have shared my pain you go to try
buy a laptop you find one that's
affordable within your price range it's
got the CPU spec you need it's got a few
other things that you need but then the
memory is either super super slow or
super low capacity and it's just not
very applicable well one thing that you
can do to get around that is to buy an
upgrade kit for your RAM that way you
can buy a fairly affordable laptop and
then get 8 to 16 gigabytes of RAM in it
for things like running VMs or having
more than one tab open in your web
browser which having having having many
many many tabs open in your web browser
in in modern day in my opinion is kind
of a requirement so if you're looking
into upgrading your memory maybe you can
look into some HyperX impact ram if your
laptop only came with one dim installed
or if you just only want to replace one
dim you get a four gigabyte or
eight gigabyte single stick of impact
ram or if you want replace both sticks
or if you just want to buy two sticks
you get a 16 gigabyte kit and all of
this Ram comes in anywhere between 1600
and 2400 megahertz to fit pretty much
any need you'll probably have for a
consumer notebook if you want to see all
