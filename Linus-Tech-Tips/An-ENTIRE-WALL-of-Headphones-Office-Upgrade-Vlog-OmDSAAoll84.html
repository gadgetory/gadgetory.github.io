empty the solution to the ultimate in
first world problems how to store your
racks upon racks of headphones in such a
way that you will be easily able to pick
out exactly the one you want for exactly
the genre of music that you are in the
mood to listen to and we are taking it a
step further so we're going to convert
an ordinary corner of the office into
the ultimate headphone auditioning room
and I'll be doing it with the help of my
wife and my infant daughter today okay
so before we get started Yvonne's
unpacking the wack ton of these EBA zero
to s that we have
I feel like this product deserves a
little bit of history because this is
not not your everyday headphone holder I
mean yes it holds headphones but it's
special I had a problem I was trying to
get all my headphones off my desk and up
onto the wall so they could be more
organized and like look really cool and
not take out so much space so we
announced a contest in partnership with
Silverstone where members of our
community submitted their 3d model
designs my mini factory printed for us
free of charge those guys are super cool
all of the top designs and then sent
them to us to evaluate in person which
ones we thought was best so Matthew the
doll ended up having the best balance
between something that looked really
clean and professional and something
that could actually be manufactured so
the way it mounts is you kind of throw
it on the wall a little something like
that you throw this on a little
something like that okay I'm doing this
from why don't we just why don't we just
get started then
I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
gaming laptops feature Intel seventh
generation core i7 processors check them
out at the link below so the idea is
that whatever cell phone or computer or
whatever device someone brings in here
they would be able to plug it in to the
amp and DAC of their choice and plug in
the headphones of their choice for the
most custom possible listening
experience so wow this thing is really
crappy where do you even buy furniture
this crappy it's fantastic I love their
packing list one cheap bag got it
yes it's pronounced exactly like you
think this is the Valhalla - so I'm not
actually sure which tubes go where but
holy cow look at that build shoot I'm
losing track of which adapters go with
what this one's 16 ok that's ok
everything's labeled here's the other
big dog this is the Jochen I'm in Norse
mythology it's the land of the giants so
this maybe this should just be a storage
shelf then so it's 5 4 &amp;amp; 5 which means
this is actually going to take up like a
wack ton of space like almost the whole
wall so I want we lay them out on the
floor ok so that's pretty much the
spacing that we need then how high do
you think you could realistically go
before it becomes a problem
hey Taryn can I borrow you for a minute
love his enthusiasm you gotta just
prototype well I can reach higher than
that well how high can you I can reach
to here does that seem to horizontally
spaced out no I'm saying if I don't
compress them more we're gonna be
watching with we're gonna be watching
with it letterboxed I'll use I'll use
video terminology I know what you're
talking about
so we don't want black to see black bars
right so they're still 60 high but
they're less wide so it's letterboxed
and has black bars please don't use
analogy yes compress them together okay
great so we won't compress them so mark
your 13-inch spot so the first thing I
need to do is draw a level line yeah you
can hold the level actually I can
probably just use a gravity no like I
can't easily oh yes I can
no I can use gravity I'll use gravity no
no it's fine all right that's not good
look how bent it is you know I don't
have the mark you know what I'm gonna
fold the level level it'll put the cut
that I need to draw a line along the
ruler so ruler on the mark and then the
level needs to be level it's on the
markets not leveled okay I'm just gonna
draw a light line does this even earase
have we checked given we shouldn't have
all of these all over the table
oh that's like level ish what you mean
it communitive we've had a level you are
so talkative
oh you must get up daddy actually we
need to do we need to do the whole grid
so Brandon you might as well cut for him
a few minutes here
so day two of a task that we really
thought would be finished a lot sooner
the ah we have to take these off because
otherwise we're gonna like we're gonna
see them from the bottom they're just
gonna have these ugly barcodes on them I
don't think that's the end of the world
yeah that looks stupid no one's gonna be
like that looking at the bar well you
don't have to be I mean look you will
obviously see it so the way it goes
together is actually pretty simple you
just kind of pop these guides in here
well and you don't do that it's only
stripped a little okay so five down 13
to go hey honey are you microwaving your
shoes are you gonna open it breasts get
laid it's not ready oh okay
are you giving her a power tool I'm not
giving her a power tool I'm helping her
operate the power tools you press that
button oh look you put the screw in
motor crews should I hold them in my
hand would that work better okay so we
marked out our entire grid in pencil
we're just gonna go ham and put drywall
screws straight into the wall so
basically three screws then we slide
that onto there look at that it's like
it's professionally installed or
something I'm liking this check that out
face mouth
yeah daddy did put those in his mouth
but you don't put those in your mouth
okay she probably learned the
microwaving shoes from you oh come on
now she learned anything about cooking
it's from you can you pass me three of
those honey that's a measuring tape
darling I said my helper who passes new
screws oh that's not a screw with the
black ones how many of that there's a
little magnetic thing yep that's better
than the mouth and the hand I mean for
certain things are they level
how many of them are there uh there's
ten of these silver ones and eight of
the brown ones trying to do rhinos with
babies is not easy it's fine I got the
door I got more headphones for you okay
over under over under Oh actually I
didn't do it that way I put the cable
through here that's not how you do it
well I don't know at least it won't fall
off I can do it properly now - we'll
make this a PSA this is how you use a
velcro tie you take one part of the wire
you run it through then you secure it to
that spot on the wire that way it
doesn't get lost perfect every time
perfect dish
so the fact that we're three short means
that your count was off thought you were
supposed to be good at math aren't you
our accountant one accounting class does
not make you an accountant the fact that
you hold a position called accountant at
our company makes you an accountant it
don't make you a good play I don't call
myself an accountant but you're our
accountant I happen to do accounting
that does not make me an accountant
I was sure there was a switch in this
room on the drawing remember when I
asked the contractor to figure out if
they drywalled over the switch
well I guess they drywalled over the
switch because I have no idea where this
I knew it
see there's no switch for this light
there's one over there - we drywalled
over a light switch the original plan
was to actually have it on this wall
which is light purple with a light right
there
so if wise had actually listened to me
and put it where it was supposed to go
maybe it wouldn't look so dark well we
couldn't have put it on that wall wasn't
gonna fit on that wall with the thing we
went through this you agreed with me no
not really I just went along with your
plan anyway changing the subject
entirely we're done
what do you want me to do sorry what's
your head we have two more oh yeah we
have two more decks so Silverstone sent
us what are these they're EB o1e and EB
Oh three this looks like ventilation
holes so I guess this probably shouldn't
sit on top of it and we should really
anchor that shelf to the wall before you
put some more stuff on there oh sure
okay fine
I think this basically just has to be a
storage shelf yeah yeah I don't think
having everything plugged in here makes
any sense if you're gonna have to bring
your device over here okay so it's just
finishing touches timed out I just need
to put this here put in a couple drywall
anchors oh crap we hit a stud that's a
drywall anchor brilliant now we have
like a gigantic gaping hole in the wall
yep no tilt perfect alright good so this
is pretty much it
well personally I think I am gonna go
for the LCD 2s because I have never
heard these off of a tube amp and I have
already pre-selected the valhalla - tube
amp its tubular yo you can just plug an
audio source directly into the amp
mission accomplished well this does not
about how they look Eady
it's about how they sound and they sound
very good by the way
I can listen to Taylor Swift if I want
to I'm a strong independent woman okay
so let's get some other people to try a
cornice um okay look do the cats 100 cuz
it's the only one it looks different
oh this was double current dog seat oh
yeah this is what I did okay it's ready
ish just why did she do it this foot
Vaughn I can't wait yeah just hold on
hold on
as your Katy Perry ever sounded better
yeah can you actually try some good
headphones so let's let Dennis be the
judge this project success yeah I like
it that's right but maybe we get it more
RGB here okay John come in this isn't a
prank as a child the headphone wall oh
yes these definitely okay isn't this the
worst experience ever no don't don't
okay why don't you listen first and then
decide anything I thought such a
headphone slob right now is clear but
that's about the most interesting act
thing I can say about it it's clear
actually here by the dt9 is anybody's I
have 880 250 ohms on my desk by this so
these are a little bit different
yeah these are very engaging I like them
the other ones I feel like you're always
losing something in the low-end but
these ones are a little more fun okay so
give me a score on a scale of one to ten
cool project you plan to use it oh.hello
11 absolutely yeah yeah that's right ed
I eat it's gonna hate okay we've got our
next test subject do I register is
anything wrong here and she's anything
you want oh it's like Willy Wonka's
candy shop but all they have is
headphones and you can't eat them and
you don't take them home this is school
on a scale of one to ten what do you
think of this project pretty cool you'll
use it yeah this is really cool
whoa as I drop these headphones eight
out of ten only because if you go to
like Best Buy our future shop or
whatever they have it already plugged in
and then you just push the button on
which one to change to but they don't
have a bunch of different sources but
you can try out an experiment with true
yes yeah I guess so
it's good I like it do you use Amazon we
