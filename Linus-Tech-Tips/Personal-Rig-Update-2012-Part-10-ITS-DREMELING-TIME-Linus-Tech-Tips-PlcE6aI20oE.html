following without me out and the me on
Twitter at Linus Tech and I am
resurrecting the personal build project
I found the perfect motherboard the GA
x79 su p50 coil wine great look it'll
match everything else that I got going
on here really well so my next step is
to start making some cuts into the case
for cable management the reason I didn't
want to move ahead with any cable
management holes before I had finalized
the motherboard is because where would I
cut the holes if I don't know where the
cables are going to be running and what
kind of a board I'm going to be using so
I'm going to be cutting some cable
management holes I'm going to be
painting some things myself so things
like the outside of the optical drive
I'm just going to be priming and
spraying with a textured black whereas
the bulk of the case components I'm
going to be sending away to mountain
mods to be painted in black once I have
made my necessary cuts so it never hurts
to give a metal surface a quick scuff
just to make sure that the primer will
adhere so I'm not going for a perfect
finish on so I won't be over
complicating things in terms of the
preparation process there we go
make sure that's working you always want
to apply spray really really lightly
like under do it as opposed to overdoing
it this can be recoded in as little as
about half an hour so I'm not not too
concerned about getting perfect coverage
no one will ever see the top of the
optical drive but I'm feeling the
sticker off just for the sake of semi
completeness here and when you're done I
actually make sure you're always in a
well ventilated area when you're done
with an aerosol always make sure you
clean out the nozzle before you're
pretty finish well those lines seem
pretty straight trusty Dremel never
fails I got to do CPU cut out I decided
not to do any cutouts for you know ATX
24 pin or whatever else I'm just going
to bring them around like I used to and
then I do want to do a cutout here for
routing various stuff under the bottom
of the motherboard same thing here and
to the back of the to the back of the
backplate I'm also going to do a CPU
shut up just that I can easily change
CPU blocks and yeah so here's a couple
cuts having been made with the Dremel
for the CPU cut out and do two more of
those and then I think the last cut is
going to be down here for the cable
management and we're making some
progress here and more progress so I
have done the CPU cut out that's some
freehand dremel in right there actually
pretty straight all things considered
should I have marked it yes but I didn't
so there you go so now there's see
there's a door for the for the CPU cut
out so uh that'll give me the ability to
close it off when I'm when I don't want
acting I'm just kidding I'm gonna just
take that off there alright so there you
go now I will be able to easily install
CPU coolers or remove them without any
difficulty um I'm also really not sure
what to do about this that looks kind of
goofy with that little gap there so I
might just take this all the way to the
edge but I might just leave it I mean
it's in the right position it's sort of
the right size for the eight pin now all
that's left is I want to do some cuts
sort of along the bottom here so that I
can run things like front panel
connectors and stuff like that behind
the motherboard without without any
difficulty
so more progress it's all good all right
so let's call that pretty much it for
this personal rig update so I've thrown
the hardware back into the case just so
that I can do a little bit of test
fitting so number one is the hole for
the eight pin connector is good and I'll
be able to run sort of fan wires through
there and stuff and anywhere where I
don't want to run fan wires through here
if I want to be even more hidden there's
also a hole drilled here I should widen
that a little bit before I'm done
actually I can take these ones and those
ones cathode lights can have their wires
run through there so this ya actually
know what this might just be for for the
eight pin so what else have we got
that's new other than that you're not
going to be able to see many changes
from this side so you can see now I can
run the the SATA cables from my raid
card to the back of the mother
or tray where all the drives will go
just find my one of my thing to drive so
the drives will go back here and then
the SATA data cables will come through
here on the back so I've got two more
cable management holes this one's for
like front USB or front panel connectors
all that kind of stuff I was thinking
about cutting one here for SATA cables
if I ever decide to plug the drives
directly into the motherboard but I
decided not to sometimes II can see the
motherboard cutout is lined up correctly
so I've got access to all four holes
back here there's that eight pin I
decided against cutting holes over here
for 24 pin and PCIe there's just I don't
think there's any perfect way to do this
so unfortunately I'm stuck with mounting
the t-virus kind of here I'll just be
kind of hovering off the motherboard
trade there and this is going to just go
around it and this is just going to go
around it yes I know it's not ideal but
I don't really see a better way to do
everything at this point with how much
Hardware I'm cramming in here I mean
remember this is going to be full of a
radiator I thought about doing a mid
plate here but just time and effort
constraints I'm not going to end up
doing it so I'm just going to get the
whole thing powder-coated once I've made
all the cuts all right more cuts that I
need to do so I need a way to get all
these cables up past here past here
because the side panel closes right
against this so I'm going to cut big
holes here to here so that I can move
all my cables up this way I'm going to
widen this one right here and that's
going to give me two really good options
actually no it'll probably do I'll
probably do something here as well three
good options to get cables from the back
of the system down to the bottom of the
system without running them through the
existing cable routing holes here so
that should pretty much fix my only
complaint about the TJ o7i well no my
two only complaints cable management's
terrible and the the interior should be
black so once we get those cut and
powder coated we should be good to go
thanks for checking out my personal rig
update and stay tuned for more I'm
hoping to actually get this done within
the calendar
year I know I call it personal rig
update 2012 so so we're on the clock
here if it runs into 2013 my title will
no longer be correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
