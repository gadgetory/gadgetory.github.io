in Europe they use a comma so we're
going to go ahead and open this bad boy
I think I gave away the secret but this
is the couch master and the couch master
is intended to be the ultimate gaming
station designed to be used on your
couch by masters right here is a USB 3 5
meter active extension cable repeater
that's actually the awesomest thing ever
especially because it's USB 3 which
means that you can plug this into a hub
and you'll have full speed with no
signal degradation at like 5 meters
which for you Yanks out there is 15 feet
which is friggin awesome so big old
thick cable that's like that's worth the
value of like at least a few dollars
right there I wonder if that was on
there itemized list alright so then we
got the orange one there's a bunch of
different colors red whatever that is
black blue green yellow orange purple
and they say were sneaked at on sale
Mitch nice and bold cut so I don't know
what accent that was but I was trying
really hard to make it a good one and
we're going to go ahead and cut but
we're just going to be really careful
about the way that we cut the tape
alright find out what's inside here this
is why they don't want you to just kind
of dig in there with the knife because
that is the couch master itself right
there so we're going to again be very
very careful with our knife just cutting
the packing tape and not going any
deeper than that and it looks like it
comes in a sort of wide variety of
different pieces here all of which are
helpfully valued at a particular value
and I'm running out of things to say
about it so why don't I explain a little
bit about what you'd want to use this
for so if you are the ultimate anti
console gamer and you insist on using a
PC whether it's for your sort of big
screen what does it call big screen
valves thing big screen big box
I don't know big something
big gaming big picture that's the one
big picture gaming experience whether
you want to use it with those optimized
games with a controller or whether you
actually want to sit on your couch with
a mouse and keyboard and play hardcore
PC titles this will pretty much allow
you to do it so guys I'm not going to
take away any of the unpacking
experience from this video I want you to
experience the whole thing because from
what I can see so far
it is going to be quite a treat to to
reveal sort of effort look at that they
include two active extension cables they
want you to have the true pure PC gaming
experience where you do not as a PC
gamer have to use a hub you are going to
use a dedicated damn cable for your
mouse and a dedicated damn cable for
your keyboard and that is the way it's
going to be and Slick's point three no
this is something else
oh they include a hub - they include a
four port USB 3 hub okay so at your desk
this is just little crisp so you'll have
a hub and you'll have two full five
gigabit per second connections alright
so this right here is a little pocket
for putting hanging your mouse in I
believe it's also used for cable
management or something like that
although I'll have to double check what
exactly they want that pocket to be used
for they also include an ample supply of
velcro tape so this is like a double
sided tape velcro thing so you can go
ahead and get everything all stuck
together real good they've got a bunch
of cushions so these are wrist cushions
that you can go ahead and position
wherever you want you can stick them
down however you want you got a few of
those and these right here are the main
Christians themselves so we're obviously
not going to be able to finish this
video here since I clearly don't have an
adequate couch but basically the couch
master sits on either side of you with a
table that goes across the entire top
these are soft like these are supple
cushions check this out let's see if he
hits me back it's not going to do it's
not going to do it
so here I actually have no idea where my
switcher is between the two cameras but
I'll let I'll let diesel have some fun
with his camera for a change here
well I show you guys the the surface
itself that actually here we go oh okay
so there's some cable management
compartment action going on down there
so this thing's friggin awesome
this is like a geeks wet dream here so
it's got ah here whoops okay I pop that
out but there's cable management holes
that come through the top there's
actually four of them and then you can
go ahead and either leave them in or
take them out then you've got these
little spot okay well that's not staying
in for me there but let's go ahead and
sorta like is there like an angle that
it goes in at yeah there that's a thing
okay so then you manage the cables here
then when you're done managing the
cables you close up that bottom
compartment like that then you have
cable management holes on the other side
two more cable management holes here
that you can go ahead and cover up with
another compartment made out of a stiff
material feels like feels like some sort
of particle board or something like that
not too heavy or anything though and
then this guy right here seems to be oh
I don't think you're supposed to feel
that up and that's not really a thing
okay so the angle of it is such that it
is inclined for optimal PC sort of
keyboard and mouse use so you can see it
has a bit of a bit of a slope to it so
you can go ahead and you stick down your
wrist rests so that you can comfortably
use your keyboard and mouse guys we got
to set this up on the couch we're going
to have to we're going to be back this
is amazing
so just for the lawls we had to set up
the couch master in its native
environment so I've got my media PC over
there we actually only had to run one of
the active USB 3 cables so I'm just
running that to the keyboard itself and
then I'm running the g9 mouse off of the
keyboard since I happen to already have
wireless headphones
I mean honestly though if I'm going to
play on a media PC I might as well you
know use my full-size speakers in this
case I'm just playing audio surf so we
could we could easily run other games
but honestly my media PC is kind of
anemic it's optimized more for silence
versus
is being optimized for sheer horsepower
but when I'm done playing video games
here which is going to be at the end of
my actually you know what I already hit
a wall anyway so I guess it doesn't
really matter so I'm going to show you
guys how we did get it set up for
optimal use here so number one is I'd
like to show you guys the convenient
baby pouch here on your lap where you
can have your baby sitting with you
while you play video games second I'd
like to show you guys how we did set up
the velcro so we've made it so that you
can kind of disassemble it but you can
also get the couch master set up really
really quickly with the wrist rest the
wrist rests are extremely comfortable so
what you do is you when you want to get
D gear of five you can see the keyboard
and all the wrist rests are actually
velcro down if I had a hard nosed pad I
would probably also velcro down the
mousepad itself so I could take the
whole thing and lift it off me it's got
some heft to it because it does use wood
for the construction if I want to put my
mouse away though oh did you guys take
that off Oh
slick apparently took off the seat
there's a this is a mouse pouch so you
just go ahead and tuck your mouse in
there so it doesn't get scratched or
lost or whatever else and you can clip
it to the front of the couch master
right here umm I'm not going to sort of
work too hard at this though honestly I
don't know that the mall actually I'd
probably use that for when I put the
couch master away it's the kind of thing
that like when your great-aunt comes to
visit you don't necessarily want to have
it sitting on your couch not that I'm
saying you should be embarrassed to be
nerdy enough to have a couch master I'm
just saying that your great-aunt
probably doesn't need to know about it
so cable management wise on the bottom
there's plenty of room for that USB 3
hub that's included as well as the
active cables and whatever else not only
that but aside from the for cable
management holes that allow you to run
wires up to the top of the unit there's
also a pass-through right here so you
can actually go between the two
compartments giving you a ton of
flexibility in terms of cable management
space and even these covers here are
extremely rugged made out of some kind
of wood with like a plethora coating on
top of them looks like a laminate
actually looks like a laminate floor
board to be perfectly honest I'm not
sure what they actually made it out of
but but there you go very comfortable
very comfortable
I've seen demos on their site of it
being used on the arm rests but I'd say
it's actually best used on a couch as
opposed to on an easy chair with these
cushions on the armrest I guess what you
could also do though if you had two
cushions that were close together is you
could just use the board itself because
we were discussing this off-camera
the cushions aren't really where the
magic happens I mean yeah you've got
your integrated drink holder doodad or
whatever else you want to put in there
but you can buy a cushion like this at
sort of any furniture store the magic
piece is this guy with the correctly
inclined piece here the integrated cable
management as well as the well mostly
that the inter the sturdy construction
the wrist rests is the couch master
worth your money I guess it depends on
how much time you expect to spend sort
of playing video games on the couch with
the keyboard and mouse versus using a
controller if it was me I definitely
prefer a controller to a keyboard and
also I was even talking to slick about
whether or not you could potentially
hook up like a racing wheel to this
thing it's quite well built so we
haven't tried it of course but hey
there's options there as well thank you
