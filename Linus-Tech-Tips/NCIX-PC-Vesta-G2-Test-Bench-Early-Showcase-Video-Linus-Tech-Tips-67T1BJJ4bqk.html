Russian lab so as you guys probably know
if you watch my channel at all I have
about ten videos about it in the last
little while the GTX 680 is finally here
so this is a videos new flagship
graphics card takes over where the GTX
580 left off and that means that we need
a new ultimate performance system to go
around it so we're actually going to
have two systems although there's a bit
of a twist to it this time so here on
the test bench we are validating our
extreme configuration so right now we're
just installing the OS so we don't have
the second graphics card on here but
this is going to be an intel core i7
extreme 39 60 X 16 gigs of ram dual GTX
680 s these are two gig graphics parts
we're gonna have two Intel 520 series
SSDs so these are running down here in
raid zero for our boot drive blu-ray 80
+ Platinum 1000 watt power supply as
well as a four terabyte storage drive so
this is an ultimate system it's all
going to be in the 650d and I don't know
if you guys remember these but there's
only gonna be one of these ultimate
systems because we only have one
ultimate green machine case left so it
will be individually numbered and you
will be the one who buys the extreme
version of our upcoming system however
we are going to also have a
mass-produced mass-produced version of
it this one's gonna have one graphics
card one SSD the 3930k as opposed to the
3960 x we're gonna step down the power
supply as well I mean come on a B+
Platinum is cool and everything but it's
I mean it's unnecessary I mean if you're
gonna get an extreme system you might as
well do it but you know things are what
they are and it will be a non painted
version of the case now they're both
going to be using the H 100 as the
cooler which gives us enough mount a
fair amount of flexibility for
overclocking the 3930k is going to be
overclocked at 4.2 gigahertz and if you
do spring for the extreme edition
one-of-a-kind system then you'll get a
30 960 X at 4.4 gigahertz so I think
that pretty much covers it
hopefully I'll have some kind of an
update for you guys once this is
actually built in the system and it is
you know got all the lighting effects
going on we're going to be using
BitFenix as alchemy connect LED strips
so these are fantastic LED lights as
well as their spectre LED fans oh okay
the crazy Russian is showing us an LED
fan thank you for that and we will
definitely be pulling off this blue LED
right here and I have no idea what he's
pointing at either glow oh the under
glow all very nice okay boom
is it a car anyway
so we'll take off this blue LED this is
gonna be a fully black and green themed
system hence the all-black motherboard
all black with green accents video card
all black RAM black and silver you know
like grayscale power supply it's gonna
look really sharp guys so thank you for

Russian laboratory and don't forget to
