description to learn more about the a
data - drive air AE 400 welcome to my
unboxing it's something that's kind of
overdue this is primo chills primo flex
advanced LRT tubing and the reason this
is overdue is because this is the only
tubing that I've been willing to use
actually ever since the original primo
flex LRT since it launched it is head
and shoulders better than anything else
I've ever used for a number of reasons
that are particularly of importance to
me
so first of all what you get in the Box
is one of their sysprep additives so you
add that to your liquid before you fire
up the lookk this didn't used to come
with the old LRT but it does come with
advanced LRT because they've changed the
technology a little bit so I'm going to
go through the reasons why I think this
tubing is awesome and then I'll go
through why primo flex thinks it's
awesome so number one I think it's
awesome all LRT stands for low radius
technology and that basically is the
blend of substances that they use to
make this stuff that makes it extremely
resistant to kinking so you can even get
right down there to a very tight Bend
radius without it kinking and
restricting water flow this is a very
desirable trait for tubing number two is
the fact that it doesn't have any
visible random branding or anything on
it so there's no markings or anything
like that it's extremely clean looking
in your loop no matter what speaking of
extremely clean looking it stays looking
pretty much like the day you bought it
until I don't I don't know I'm I'm up to
two years with some of the tubing in my
system without actually changing it and
that means like taking it apart and
putting it back together and actually
reusing tubing is let's just like oh
this stuff's still good because it's
still nice and pliable that's another
thing some tubing's can harden over time
and get to the point where particularly
with compression fittings or barb
fittings they'll they'll completely
deform lose the shape they'll be too
hard too stiff to really use them
anymore it stays nice and pliable also
it stays clear and the UV reactive
effect stays strong so Advanced LRT has
been changed over the original LRT and
it's added a very very smooth inner wall
that primo flex claims causes a few
were less junk to build up on the inside
and makes it less likely for microbe
growth so they've still added this
sysprep additive but it no longer has
the antimicrobial coating that used to
be in the original LRT so other reasons
why Prima flex thinks that it's good so
glass light transparency actually
they're clear is very clear it's
available in a variety of colors which
you can see here onyx black elegant
white crystal clear bloodshed red and
brilliant UV blue I know they used to
have green I hope they still have green
because their green was really nice
superior UV transmission which is true
logo free inner wall resilience
environmentally responsible safe and
non-toxic product okay that I actually
didn't know so there you go guys
oh here are the available sizes so
half-inch thick wall 7/16 inch sort of
medium wall 3/8 thick wall and 3/8 thin
wall tubing's are all available the only
tubing sizes that to me really matter
are 3/8 inch ID 5/8 inch OD because that
gives you better compatibility on your
blocks for things like wide compression
fittings and then if you really want
that bling bling huge look with massive
tubing then half inch ID 3/4 inch of OD
is still very relevant as well one of
the other reasons I like 3/8 ID 5/8 OD
so that's what I'm using here that's
thick wall 3/8 is because this is the
one that actually gets that best Bend
radius and still allowing enough water
flow so you've got that much room for
water to flow and a huge thick wall
around it which means you can really
make really tight turns if you have to
get like from one fitting to another and
you got to kind of do that with it so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at primo flex well it's
not my first look I've been using this
stuff for years but after our Advanced
LRT tubing don't forget to subscribe to
