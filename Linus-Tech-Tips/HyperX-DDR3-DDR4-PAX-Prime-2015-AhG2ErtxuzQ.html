2 in the link the video description down
below also thanks to a soos and Corsair
with us here today we have a few
different types of RAM we have a fury
ddr3l kit an impact ddr4 the kind of
like laptop and small machine kit and a
savage ddr4 kit which is running us 4
different capacities and speeds but one
of the most interesting things at this
show that I'd like to cover is ddr4 and
ddr3 prices becoming more familiar and
similar to each other last year when I
covered something at pax prime ddr4 was
astronomically expensive and just not
very easy to get your hands on now it's
more ubiquitous it's more available
everywhere and the pricing is finally
becoming closer to where ddr3 was and
there's still a delta it's still more
expensive but it's becoming more
accessible now that skylake is gonna be
a thing and Allah all that kind of stuff
is coming out very good to see first up
I'll start with fury ddr3l this is the
low voltage kiss so this is me running
at one point three five volts when it's
in your system it's also be running at
1600 megahertz or 1866 megahertz eight
gigabyte capacity or sixteen gigabyte
capacity and that's about it we're
moving away from this but it's kind of
interesting because if you want to
retire some old hardware onto like a
server or something it might be a good
and nice idea to get low voltage rent
next up we have impact ddr4 this goes in
like laptops and small micro systems
it's pretty freakin fast for what it is
at 26 66 megahertz you'll be running at
a casa latency of 15 at 24 hundred
megahertz he'll be running at CL 14 and
2133 makers you'll be running at CL 13
and its fastest speeds there's not
actually a lot of stuff out that you can
even plug this into some compatibility
down the line is going to be fairly
interesting you might want to check that
out before you buy it
but if you want to run this kit as fast
as it can go you're probably gonna want
to pair it with a pretty badass
processor just so you guys know next up
we have savage ddr4 now I know this
isn't new but it's now in black before
it was just read now it's black this
should be cheaper than your predator
options and someone close to the VBR 3
than that fairly expensive predator kit
this will be coming at 21 33 megahertz
console latency 13 24 hundred megahertz
at CL 1220 600 megahertz at CL 1320
800 megahertz at CL 14 and 3000
megahertz at CL 15 this will come in up
to 8 by 16 gigabytes of capacity so you
can get 128 gigs of this ram if you're
running it at a maximum speed of 20 666
megahertz
alright guys I hope you liked watching
this memory update at the HyperX booth
thank you to hyperx for sending us to
you this year check out their YouTube
channel in the cards link up here in
this kind of corner they make a whole
bunch of cool like gaming inspired
