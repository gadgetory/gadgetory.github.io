Linus tech tips is going to be featuring
two things first a company that no
longer exists
soy yo motherboard and second my little
brother who was already featured on a
fan unboxing much to the bewilderment of
my normal audience so first of all a
sure I would like you to tell me what
this is designed for this is designed
for running a computer if it is designed
for Microsoft Windows XP ok awesome and
it is the home of what the dragon home
of the dragon it could very well be
where they invented the digital dragon
the digital dragon ok so on the back
there is no information whatsoever hmm
awesome toyou mother yeah yeah on the
back there's nothing on the side there's
nothing on the front there's nothing oh
oh wait here we found something oh ok so
please tell me what what okay so we got
Pentium 3s AGP supports three SDRAM um
nice yeah yeah one point five gigabytes
maximum 1.5 gigs max so that's that's
more like a minimum these days so let's
get this open so the first thing we will
find is a warning please read the
warning out for me
Brosky warning comes just two pictures
this motherboard does not support older
type of Celeron processors why sure they
exist anymore 300 a5 333 MHz don't know
what that means
PPG a package type a bunch of letters
and numbers please do not install older
type of cell Allah processor on this
motherboard it might damage your Celeron
processor or motherboard that's a
damaged one that's a not damaged one is
what I'm guessing
okay so then inside we will find some
accessories we will find two IDE cables
one of which is an 80 pin and one of
which is not an IDE cable but rather a
floppy cable my dad they're great a
little looser belt they are not built I
know
you you never wear the bright one in the
family were you so we've got a soy yo
motherboard CD manual and drivers disk
including pro magic image it and DP you
whatever those are normally I would
recommend you go to the manufacturers
website um to download the latest
drivers but I'm gonna go ahead and
venture a guess that the soil website no
longer exists I'm not sure the
manufacturer exists anymore either no
they don't I already said that okay this
is the QuickStart guide where you will
find how to quickly start although yeah
this motherboard probably doesn't even
start anymore in fact I think it even
had a label on it that it's dead mind
you it smells new actually no I think I
think this board is brand spanking new
well like new never used so anyway why
don't we talk a little bit about the
features of this board first of all we
have a socket 370 supporting the latest
Intel Celeron and Pentium 3 CPUs then we
have a three SD RAM slots supporting a
maximum of 1.5 gigs so that means you
could load this baby up with 3 512
megabyte did I say dims because those
were Sims back then on my dad then we
have a chipset heatsink along with 20
pin power advanced tech 20 pin power to
deliver the best power to your AGP video
card and your 370 CPU ok also featured
on this motherboard is 2 ide channels
may be supporting raid probably not
actually and then we have 5 PCI slots
and azure pop quiz do you know what
these slots are indeed I do their video
card insert slots
that's my wild guess that was right that
was a good try but this is the video
card slot yeah no these are is a slots
these are pretty ancient at this point
then we have a floppy connector and
let's see what advanced high-tech
connectivity Oh USB check that out yo ok
let's see what kind of high-tech
connectivity we will find on the back ok
so we first of all we've got support for
a ps2 keyboard and mouse to hold us
B ports on the back two serial port so
that'll be great if you're running like
serial peripherals a parallel port if
you can actually dig up a parallel
printer you could run that and then we
have support for AC 97 audio as well as
a joystick port so thank you for
checking out our joint unboxing of the
oh this is terrific I love this of the
Soyo home of the Dragon s y7v
B a-133 you look at the camera
