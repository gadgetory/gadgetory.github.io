installing CPUs and I covered a.m. 2
a.m. 3 7 7 5 1156 and I just realized I
never did 1366 so I'm going to walk you
through the procedure to install a CPU
in socket 1366 so this is intel's x58
platform the board i'll be demoing today
is the asustor on page 3 extreme so the
first thing you want to do you see it's
got a protective cover over the pins
here that's to keep the very fragile
pins inside the socket from being
damaged because the CPU itself only has
pads you can actually touch the bottom
of the CPU it's not the best thing to do
but you could there I showed you I did
it and and it won't be nearly as easy to
damaged as something like the CPU socket
so my camera keeps focusing on that ram
so I'm going to just sort of shift my
angle here and see if I can get it to
focus on the socket so the first thing
you want to do is push down on this arm
this lever here and then pull it away
from the socket so here I'm going to do
a close-up there so you can see what I'm
doing so I'm taking that arm and I'm
pulling it out away from the socket and
lifting it up just like that ok so that
loosens this little piece right here
which is what actually keeps the CPU or
the holder firmly in place then you just
press on this little spot right here and
lift up the cover next what you're going
to want to do is you're going to want to
always something attach the cover when
the CP is now installed yeah that's to
protect the socket so then you pick this
up and let me see if I can find which
one is the labeled one yeah this says
remove so you hold it by these two
pieces right here and then you lift up
that side pull the whole thing out and
that's where you see 1336 pins you touch
those even with something as as delicate
as like a fiber from your shirt you can
easily bend a pin or even rip them
they're very very fragile so the next
thing you're going to do is take your
1366 CPU which has two notches one here
focus focus one here and one over here
you'll line that up with the two notches
in the socket which are here and here
and then you put the CPU in
be very careful to line up the corners
and never do this while you're looking
at the socket through a camera always be
looking directly at the socket do as I
say not as I do so I always give the CPU
a bit of a wiggle just to make sure it's
seated correctly because if it's in
there crooked like if it's sitting like
this and you go and and put the cover
down on it and secure it you're just
going to bend the heck out of your
socket so you just take that put it in
there's no force involved you just kind
of give it a bit of a wiggle there you
go so then you pull down this cover you
can see that the pressure that holds the
CPU and is actually from these two spots
right here so those two will press down
on the heat spreader the CPU right in
the middle then you'll take this arm and
it this requires some force so you push
it down put under the that was bad make
sure that's still in there okay yep pull
it down put it under the hook there you
go you have installed the CPU in your
1366 motherboard you are a computer
technician thank you for watching my
blog don't forget to subscribe
lots more updates and unboxings to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
