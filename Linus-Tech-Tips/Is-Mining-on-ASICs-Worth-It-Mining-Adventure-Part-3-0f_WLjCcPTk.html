for bitcoins on your old laptop due to
the constantly increasing difficulty
it's no longer practical on mortal
computers not even with multiple
high-performance graphics cards so then
how do you do it
allow me to introduce the bit main and
minor s9 a bare-bones computer of sorts
except it has no display output no way
to plug in a keyboard and it only does
one thing mine sha-256 crypto currencies
like Bitcoin oh and we've actually also
got an l-3 plus one open that one update
which does script coins like light coin
and a d3 which mines x11
cryptocurrencies like - so the goal
today is to find out if these things are
worth it and no Austin that is not
trademarked I can say it
so if you've seen part two of mining
adventure already you should have a
pretty good idea of what a fairly
efficient GPU mining setup looks like
but even that is nothing compared to an
ASIC miner for example the Radeon HD
7970 was released in 2012 and mine
Bitcoin at an efficiency of about 4 mega
hash per watt so ignoring the few
companies that never really shipped an
end-user product in late 2012 Avalon
released the Avalon 1 an ASIC miner that
didn't at the time astonishing 165 mega
hash per watt a huge bump over GPU
mining so how could they possibly
achieve this well graphics cards and
CPUs are designed to be able to process
a huge range of different calculations
which is what makes them incredibly
useful in our everyday devices this
versatility is great but it limits their
ability to do one thing really really
fast so application-specific integrated
circuits or Asics these are as the name
implies designed and purpose-built
to do just one thing and while that
might not make sense for your gaming rig
for a Bitcoin miner that only needs to
run one specific formula it is a godsend
at least for the people who own them
because of the nature of crypto
currencies the increase in overall
hashing power in the network that's
caused by a massive influx of
specialized mining hardware is a big
part of what made bitcoins difficulty go
up even further and I mean way up so
when the Avalon one came out Bitcoin
difficulty was at around 3 million by
the same time the following year it was
600 million so if you fast-forward to
2017 there are a bunch of players in the
ASIC market including bit Maine whose
hardware we have with us today
you know silicon and Baikal banks
to whom Bitcoin difficulty has reached a
whopping two trillion so all the folks
out there running GPUs for mining those
guys are focused on altcoins
like what we showed in part two so
options like the narrow Z cash and
aetherium are all popular at this time
by the way huge shout out to marshal at
og BTC on twitter and francisco over at
by vm net who helped hook us up with the
ant miner s9 the l3 Puffs and the d3
that we're taking a look at today so
let's crack the d3 open here huh so much
for the warranty sticker we'll just put
that right there I mean what else would
we do with a multi-thousand dollar
specialized computer that's out of stock
quite literally everywhere I mean as a
general rule machines that dang it
I called it I'll just go as a general
rule machines that essentially print
money are in pretty high demand so
unless you've got friends in high or low
places they're mostly obtained by
preorder and the problem with that is
that the wait lists can be as long as
several months meaning that by the time
they arrive they might not even be
profitable anymore and that's a really
relevant point here because this d3
miner now makes barely five to ten
dollars a day before electricity costs
while drawing a massive 1200 Watts from
the wall by default when these things
were announced people were buying them
left and right with dreams of making
their money back in a week and then it's
just pure profit from there on they
definitely didn't learn from the effects
of early ASIC miners on the Bitcoin
difficulty curve which naturally went
way up so now that it's open then let's
let's have a look at what's actually
going on here so the d3 unit has three
of these hashing boards each containing
hold on
so fifty and I guess it would probably
be the same though it's just one side it
is just ones from both sides Wow cool so
sorry yeah fifty a six they're held in
place by an aluminum case then which
doubles as sort of a wind tunnel with
these high airflow fans on either side
so most of the mass of this thing is
actually just the glued on heat sinks
for each chip so if we just plug back in
the hashing boards to the controller
here be very careful of course don't
worry I got this and then connect this
wiring to our controller here which by
the way see this guy right here is a
mini Linux computer and then we wire up
a power supply we got one yeah here we
go here's a power supply we should be
pretty much ready to mine right I think
so I mean we should probably put this
cover back yeah yeah we'll be back in a
minute
okay I know you really like dropping
things but it knows if you didn't drop
you're not gonna I don't trust you so
you can actually use a regular computer
power supply but with house port the
supply of those is these days in many
cases people end up using these mining
specific ones so the only real
difference is just that it only outputs
12 volt and then it just has a wack ton
of 6-pin PCI Express connectors also
because it's not designed for consumer
use the word on the street there is that
they are pretty loud so you need a
network connection because your miner
needs to be able to find and submit any
work that it needs to do
I want something done that's not too bad
that's fine yeah just give it a second
don't be fooled my friend it gets worse
much much worse
Oh
Oh oh that's a great noise so just like
with blowing mature on from one of our
recent videos
I wouldn't recommend getting any bananas
or fingers anywhere near these things so
at this point with all three of them
plugged in updated and mining at current
profitability levels we can see the s9
making about 33 bucks a day pl3 plus
about 50 in a day and the d3 while the
efficiency is pretty poor as we noted
earlier at about nine dollars a day so
we're gonna come back in a week and see
what we've been able to mine okay so
we're back again it's been about 16 days
since we installed the a6 in the the
empty not to mention not heated room
over here and where are you pulling up
the pool statistics now okay cool our s9
has been mining a fork of Bitcoin known
as Bitcoin cash and has been earning
actually over our estimated amount about
thirty to forty six per day after our
powers accounted for during this period
so if profit were to maintain like this
we'll be able to pay back the s9 at
twenty five hundred dollars in about two
and a half months not too shabby
with that said if you were looking to
pick one up for yourself it may isn't
even accepting pre-orders as of when we
were filming this and we've been seeing
them priced at over five thousand US
dollars on the second-hand market the l3
plus average de bout thirteen dollars a
day after power giving us around an
eight month ROI time definitely worse
than the former even if you are
overpaying leaving us with the d3 which
Jake actually found
firmware that allows it to draw 900
watts instead of the stock 1200 watts at
about the same hash rate so we've been
earning an average of seven dollars a
day after power giving us an ROI time of
just over seven months that's actually
better than the l3 plus since it costs
less though I wouldn't recommend picking
up a ton of d3s
since x11 miners are nowhere near as far
into their development as bitcoin and
litecoin Asics and as such are likely to
see big improvements in efficiency as
time goes on driving up the difficulty
curve so then in a nutshell at the right
pricing an ASIC miner takes up less
space and can yield better ROI time with
less software hassle and no construction
time compared to GPU mining but it comes
with higher risk worst-case scenario
GPUs can be resold for some fraction of
what you paid but since an ASIC miner
has no value outside of mining the
specific crypto currencies it's
optimized for when the profitability is
gone it just becomes an expensive
