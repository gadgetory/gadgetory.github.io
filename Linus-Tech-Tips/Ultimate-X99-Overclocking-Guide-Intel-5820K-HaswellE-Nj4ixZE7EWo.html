2011 three overclocking guide we'll be
covering the benefits of overclocking
the risks of overclocking and running
you guys through how exactly to do it
with your shiny new haswell-e six core
or eight core processor corsair gaming
RGB keyboards feature precision Cherry
MX RGB key switches for sixteen point
eight million color perky backlighting
for virtually unlimited customization
click now to learn more it always starts
with this but it's super important so we
shouldn't skip it
what is overclocking what can we
overclock and why do we do it the short
answers are for the first one basically
it's turning the speed up so that your
PC components run faster than the
manufacturer intended and you can find
more information about it here for
number two will turn up pretty much
anything with a dial on it that makes it
go faster the CPU the ran the graphics
card our prime candidate
and number three we do it because we are
driven to we have no self-control we
know about the drawbacks like higher
heat output higher power consumption and
even the potential for Hardware
degradation but we just have to have
smooth now no overclocking guide is
complete without the latest and sexiest
hardware as interesting as me pulling
out a northwood 2.4 C and cranking that
baby up might be to some people most of
you are probably watching this today
because you want to actually do some
performance tuning on hardware that
you're actually using so as always it
starts with the focus of today's video
the CPU normally for these guides we use
an extreme edition because the procedure
is actually the same for an extreme
edition or for a K series processor
anyway but today is a little different
today we're going to tune the core i7
5820k because I think it's the best bang
for the buck processor on the market for
enthusiasts and prosumers with workloads
that can benefit from its sixth
processing cores but don't have the
budget for its eight core monster of a
Big Brother the core i7 59 60 X
to go along with it six cores and 3.3 to
3.6 gigahertz the 5820k has 15 Meg's of
cache support for up to 64 gigs of DDR
for memory running in quad-channel mode
and 28 PCI Express 3.0 lanes for
multiple graphics cards or other
expansion cards this is less than the 59
30 K and the 59 60 X which each have 40
lanes but as we demonstrated here this
will only matter in certain fairly
unusual situations let's move on to our
next extreme the hardware selection if
you've been watching this channel for
any amount of time you probably already
know what Corsair dominators are here's
a clip of an old kit we painted to take
advantage of their built-in custom
lighting effects in nutshell they were
Corsairs biggest baddest sexiest ddr3
memory modules and now they're back for
more with ddr4 flavors available in
capacities from 16 to 64 gigs and speeds
up to a blistering 3,300 megahertz
although the 32 gig kit here we've got
today runs at a mere 26 60 megahertz CL
15 out of the box with its XM v 2.0
profile which of course will only work
with proper support from the motherboard
which leads us to the finest motherboard
I've ever had the pleasure of using the
Republic of gamers rampage 5 extreme
from masseuse
now asus has done no compromises rampage
grade boards before but while they
always had the performance features for
extreme overclockers they'd always be
lacking the latest high-end onboard
sound designs from the formula grade ROG
boards or the premium onboard Wi-Fi from
deluxe grade boards not this time
if you can afford one you can buy a
rampage 5 extreme knowing that you've
got it all it's oozes OSI socket with
extra pins for improved power delivery
and RAM overclocking their 4th
generation digital power delivery their
o'seas own with some features that are
actually amazingly useful even for
beginners like the safe boot button that
lets you boot to default settings
without losing the changes you just made
when your overclock fails and some stuff
that's more for the hard course like the
onboard voltage probe contact points you
get top-of-the-line storage with 8 SATA
3 ports 2 SATA Express ports and an m2
slot the late
supreme effects 2014 onboard audio and
finally three spatial stream AC wireless
with which I achieved sustained transfer
speeds of over 40 megabytes per second
during testing whoa
oh and I guess you also get support for
3-way SLI and crossfire with this CPU
and four-way support with the 40 pci
express lane ones no big blip though for
cooling i went with a corsair h 100 i
dual 120 millimeter fan all in one water
cooling system which is basically where
i would suggest starting four six core
or eight core overclocking with dual 140
millimeter fan designs like the course
rh 110 or cooler master neptune 280 l
being solid step ups power was taken
care of by coarser HX 1000 i
yes it's overkill but i guess this is
more of a because we can hardware choice
80 + platinum efficiency dead silent
operation at light medium loads a fully
modular design and corsair link
integration for all the real-time
monitoring goodness you could want from
a power supply and that pretty much does
it for the components that affect
overclocking but it should be noted that
for before and after benchmarks a gtx
780 Ti graphics card running at stock
speeds was used
alright Linus so I got all my gear in
front of me now what well start by
mashing delete while booting to enter
the UEFI BIOS and press f7 to get into
advanced mode right away none of that
easy mode stuff for us no sir
head over to boot and under setup mode
select advanced so you won't have to
switch manually every time you start up
the system then it's time to head over
to the extreme Tweaker heading where
we'll be spending most of our time you
can save yourself a lot of effort by
starting from a probably safe overclock
rather than beginning the tuning process
from stock speed and testing at every
stage for haswell-e processors I'd
recommend the multiplier of 45 a CPU
voltage of around 1.3 volts and this is
very important everything else in the
system at default settings then press
f10 to apply your settings and restart
into Windows use cpu-z to verify that
the settings were applied correctly and
run the stress testing Apple
of your choice dialing in one component
at a time we'll take some of the
guesswork out later when you're trying
to balance how hard you're pushing each
component to achieve the best overall
results just make sure that your
benchmark by the way is a safe one
recent versions of prime95 for example
can cause your CPU to pull so much power
in an overclocked or volted environment
that you're sure to do long-term damage
if you use it extensively I'm partial to
i-264
but a Seuss's own rog real bench is a
solid choice as well and it's free if
the test fails in the first 10 minutes
or so then it's time to go back to the
UEFI bios and try a lower multiplier or
as long as your cpu low temperatures are
within your comfort zone we're going to
use 80 degrees as a max for this guide
you can try slowly turning up the CPU
voltage to see if that helps and then
boot back into Windows and rerun your
test if the test passes then it's time
to restart and go back to the ufi bios
anyway because it's time to turn up your
memory speed most performance kits these
days will have X and P profiles for easy
RAM tuning and our corsair dominator
platinum kit here is no exception with
two separate profiles a more
conservative one and a more aggressive
one with higher voltages but what you
need to watch out for is the changes in
other system settings when you switch
your OC tuner mode from manual to XMP
for ram speeds below 20 400 megahertz
and including 2400 megahertz
you can skip this next part but for
speeds above 20 400 megahertz like our
Ram it's very likely that your CPU strap
will change to 125 megahertz this is
okay but it means that your CPU clock
speed will now be calculated by
multiplying the core ratio by 125 rather
than by a hundred so you will want to
keep X and P off for now and re verify
that 4.5 gigahertz stability test by
setting your multiplier to 36 with that
verified it's time to go back into the
UEFI BIOS and turn X and P back on and
this now applies to all ram speeds again
and then rerun this to
test if it fails or the system refuses
to power on consistently with error code
BD then you might be tempted to crank
round voltage but I'd probably keep that
around one point four volts max and
suggest that you may want to consider
fine tuning the system agent voltage
instead I found I got dramatically
better stability with around 1.02 volts
but your mileage may vary and bear in
mind that more is not necessarily better
here it's more of a tuning process
if after tuning si it passes then great
back to the BIOS you go now to see if
the CPU has a little bit more headroom
left inner you can raise the multiplier
until your stress tests are no longer
able to pass now in doing that you might
notice at the stage that the CPU ratios
don't give you very granular control so
if your chip handles for example 4.7
gigahertz fine but 4.8 gigahertz crashes
after a few minutes and you want to
reach your optimal setting probably
somewhere in between those two values
then this is a great time to play around
with base clock a little bit and I
really do mean a little bit my chip
handled four point seven five gigahertz
with rock-solid stability when I reached
a base clock of 101 which is as high as
I really want okay you can go higher
than that but you don't want to play
around with it too much because
tinkering with base clock outside of
using standard dividers is not
recommended because it affects many
other busses some of which like storage
for example don't take kindly to being
overclocked once you've got your CPU
dialed in it's time to play around with
memory now if you want I personally
found a Seuss's Otto profiles did a
great job and between that and XMP it
was running fast enough but if you want
you can try different Ram dividers and
try further tuning ram voltage and
system agent voltage again to overclock
your memory frequency honestly though
you might find your time better spent
trying to push for tighter Ram timings
it usually results in very similar
performance gains which you can measure
by lowering the timings preferably one
at a time and observing
formance and stability and memory
dependent benchmarks and is less likely
to D balance your overclock that you
just tuned on your CPU because some Ram
dividers are inherently more stable than
others 2400 is a good one as our 2666
29:33 and 3200 if your memory can handle
it but 2800 has trouble with some CPUs
including ours
even with kits that support that speed
something very important to note here
talking about memory dividers is that
increasing the CPU strap to 125 with the
memory at 2400 does not change your
memory divider so even though this Ram
speed increases to three thousand mega
Hertz this is still a good stable
divider the ratio is as important to
stability as the actual speed it's
running at but at the end of the day
memory fine tuning is not something I
personally do a lot of you can refer
back to my ddr3 vs ddr4 apples-to-apples
comparison but for a daily driver system
it just doesn't matter much and the kind
of instability it causes situations
where you can run a stress test for 12
hours perfectly fine only to have it
fail at 12 hours and 5 minutes is just
not worth the time it takes to verify
that the system is actually running
correctly I am Oh usually CPU tuning
aside from being the part where you get
the real tangible performance gains is
also much easier to verify through
stress testing so sticking with that is
not a bad bet
speaking of the CPU one other thing you
can fine tune at this stage is the CPU
cache ratio or uncor again it frankly
matters very little and as far as
performance compared to you know if you
just increase the CPUs raw frequency but
if you can bring your cache speed up
closer to your CPU speed it can help a
little bit with some performance metrics
once you change this though you may find
that you need to fine tune CPU voltage
and system agent voltage again so now
it's time to have a look at some
performance numbers I'm not going to be
doing a huge test suite here or anything
but I'd like to give you guys a look at
the benefits of overclocking if you're
willing to put
little bit of time into it I also
included numbers for a Seuss's Auto
overclocking TPU thing that my ws and
deluxe boards have but take them with a
gigantic grain of salt the performance
numbers look good but that system wasn't
stable at all at these settings a
departure from my normally positive
experience with a Seuss's Auto tuning so
there you have it enabling XMP on your
memory doesn't do a whole lot compared
to just running Jade X beads this
platform is really not memory bandwidth
limited even with six or eight cores to
feed thanks to its quad channel memory
capability tuning CPU speed up makes a
huge difference except for gaming where
we really aren't CPU bottlenecked in the
first place anyway
and further tuning round makes very
little difference with conservative
easily stabilized DRAM settings with
more emphasis on the impactful and
easier to tune CPU frequency being the
way to go as usual so I think that
pretty much wraps it up if you followed
along with this guide good job enjoy
your freshly overclocked CPU I hope your
results were awesome and if they weren't
then don't worry there's a good chance
it wasn't your fault anyway since the
silicon lottery dictates that the odds
of getting a CPU with more or less
overclocked ability was probably just
you know predetermined by the
overclocking gods anyway and probably
wasn't your fault so don't stop tuning
though and better luck next time thank
