to be the elusive EVGA x58 3x sli
motherboard as outlined 16 times on the
packaging it does support SLI technology
and you can also see if you look really
close at the small writing on the back
and then it supports crossfire X so
we're going to be doing an unboxing on
this motherboard and showing you all the
cool accessories that come with it and
stay tuned so I've never opened up this
board before either I'll be as surprised
as you by what's inside here we have a
rich accessory package including mm-hmm
a visual guide to your new x58 sli
motherboard this is actually pretty cool
it gives you some neat information like
which are your primary memory channels
so you want to use the green slots first
and then the black ones it also shows
you what all of the headers and ports
and buttons are for on the motherboard
itself and it gives you a super zoom din
view including some instructions on how
to install all the components on your
board and get set up also present in the
box for the EVGA x58 3x sli motherboard
is a manual a driver CD which normally
wouldn't even be worth a mention but
this one does include EVGA z' new elite
overclocking utility so you can actually
overclock theoretically very well in a
Windows environment which is great
you're throwing your usual cables some
SATA cables I eat me and then you've got
these back IO plate adapters you got
firewire USB and a serial adapter if
you're actually still using that with
your $400 x58 motherboard an i/o shield
and you've got a tri sli and a dual sli
bridge so next up is the motherboard
EVGA x58 motherboard includes a lot of
really good features particularly for
enthusiasts and overclockers such as the
speaker and reset power and clear CMO
switches all being right there on the
you've also got right-angle SATA
connectors over on this side which means
that it's not going to interfere with
any full-length graphics cards they've
completely redesigned the cooling
solution on this board so you have a
South Bridge North Bridge kind of cooler
here which hopefully with the new
redesigned fan will improve on the fan
noise of previous EVGA and other boards
and then you can see that it's
completely disconnected maybe you can't
see that from the mosfet cooler which is
very shiny which means that if you were
to mother water pool the North Bridge
and the South Bridge you wouldn't
necessarily have to remove the mosfet
cooler like you would with a lot of
modern motherboards now on the back
panel you can see EVGA is given special
attention to enthusiasts with a clear
CMOS button as well as including a
legacy ps2 keyboard port which is great
for overclocking because sometimes USB
ports are not recognized correctly as
soon as a ps2 port for making BIOS
adjustments last but not least you've
got your CPU socket for your core i7 GPU
and six memory slots for up to 12 gigs
of memory so to close out this unboxing
and sort of product spotlight on the
EVGA x58 motherboard we are going to
play motherboard frisbee so if I could
get Cameron to go low</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
