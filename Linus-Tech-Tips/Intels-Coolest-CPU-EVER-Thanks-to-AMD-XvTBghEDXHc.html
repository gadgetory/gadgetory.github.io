full-size desktop game intel released
their skull canyon nook a tiny gaming
bare-bones all the way back in 2016
it had no dedicated graphics but it
still ignited an arms race prompting
competitors like ZOTAC and msi to try to
pack as much horsepower as possible into
the smallest packages possible and Intel
finally has a follow-up the hades canyon
nook or nu c8 i7 h VK AVR and triple-a
game capable pc boasting an 8th gen Core
i7 quad-core CPU and AMD Radeon Vega
graphics in a package about the same
size as a Harry Potter novel you know
what else is novel origin PC they offer
beautiful custom desktops high
performance laptops and life time 24/7
technical support they use only high
quality products like samsung's 960 /
1.2 SSDs and you can check them out at
the link below
before we get to the new one here's a
skull canyon from 2016 the formula that
intel followed for the design of this
nook was actually great solid CPU lots
of i/o including thunderbolt free and it
was easy to upgrade it was basically
perfect for a compact computer except
for the lack of dedicated graphics I
mean this pretty much limited it to easy
to run games like overwatch and
minecraft which is a pretty tough pill
to swallow for anyone paying six hundred
and fifty dollars which is a
considerable premium over a desktop
system for a bare-bones with no RAM or
storage but in the last two years a lot
of things have happened including
evidently hell freezing over
because AMD and Intel came together at
last to create this which actually now
that I think about it is that where the
Hades the name came from anywho this
thing is pretty o P it's 999 dollars for
the top tier bare-bones kit which is
pricey but it includes a hyper threaded
quad core Core i7 88 o 9g and Vega mgh
graphics or it's $7.99 for the step-down
one that gives up overclocking support
and point 1 gigahertz of CPU turbo and
drops from 24 to 20 compute units on the
GPU first thing I notice about it is
it's really really heavy for how small
it is and that while it is still small
it is not nearly as compact as the old
ones so it better bring some really
impressive performance to the table all
panels say for the top are completely
covered in hexagonal perforations to
allow as much air as possible to be fed
into the dual bottom mounted fans as for
IO it's impressive
starting with USB we get a total of
seven including a Type C and a quick
charger on the front and it can connect
up to six displays including
the access to HDMI for a VR headset
overall it's got more i/o than many
desktops including not one but two
Thunderbolt 3 ports cracking it open we
get a look at the internals now Oh check
that out so you can see through it
that's where the RGB lighting comes
through for the skull on the top and
then removing this additional screw
right here we can lift up this plate to
get a look at our options for memory and
storage so we've got two sodium slots
with support for up to 32 gigs of DDR 4
RAM and dual full-length oops and dual
full-length 80 millimeter m dot 2 slots
with support for both AHCI and nvme
drives as well as raid 0 and raid 1 so
we're gonna be using an intel octane 800
p for our boot drive and then a regular
nvme SSD for our storage drive because
like Yolo right anyway while we're in
here we also get a look at the backside
of the CPU and GPU so it's got this odd
rectangular shape to it here and that's
for a reason that's because of the way
that the RX Vega mgh so the H here is
for high performance connects directly
to the main CPU and they're actually
installed on the same substrate so this
special engineering trick which is
basically a PCI Express 8 X link right
between them is what makes the system so
powerful compact and power efficient
compared to other small form-factor
desktops alright time to plug it in now
and oh that is a beefy power brick that
power brick is actually almost the size
of the old Nook anyway fun fact the eyes
the skull and the power button are all
separate RGB zones so you can make them
any color you want or turn them off if
you prefer that sort of thing
but that's not the most important thing
you guys want to know how it performs
and isn't this hilarious
this is AMD software but just like with
an intel skin on it like this so bizarre
anyway let's let's get some games fired
up and talk performance here we compared
Hades Canyon with Intel's last
generation skull Canyon as well as a
similarly priced desktop excluding costs
for storage ram and operating system and
it's performance is actually pretty
surprising compared to the last gem
Skull Canyon Nook Hades Canyon
completely blows it out of the water as
Intel integrated graphics just isn't
even in the same ballpark as the Radeon
Vega chip that the hades canyon uses as
for the gap between the new nook and our
8700 k desktop system it's pretty
noticeable with an average overall
increase of about 35% across the
spectrum of games and synthetic tests
that we used though this isn't bad if
you consider the Knux 50% lower TDP and
it's tiny form factor but does buying
this nook make any sense
well actually especially in light of the
pricing of decent dedicated graphics
cards right now as a compact minimal
HTPC the hades canyon is actually pretty
awesome like if you told me three years
ago that this was running on this I'd
have been looking for the hidden wires
but but this is real and not only is the
noise not a problem from like a couch
distance or even from this distance the
performance is good enough to play
basically any game even if it's not at
absolute maximum settings so as long as
you're willing to give up future upgrade
ability and you'll get some kind of a
benefit from the size maybe you go to a
lot of lands for example it's actually
not a terrible deal for all the hardware
that's included Optimas new force be2
wireless Bluetooth earphones feature up
to 10 hours of continuous listening
battery life their IP x5 rated water and
they're resistant it's crafted with
polycarbonate and equipped with Kevlar
reinforced cables and the wireless
design with magnetic earpieces allows
for tangle-free listening and
portability it comes with spin fit twin
blade ear tips that are made from high
quality silicon and designed to provide
optimal fit and comfort the Optimas new
force be2 is the only model at this
price range supporting AAC which ensures
maximum audio quality and iphone
connectivity as well as other Apple
products get them now for just thirty
nine bucks us for a limited time at the
