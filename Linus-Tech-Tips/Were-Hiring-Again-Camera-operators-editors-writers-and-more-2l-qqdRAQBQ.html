and not just a little bit we're hiring
for both Linus Media Group and flow
plane so for those of you who are
looking for a job stay tuned and for
those of you who are just like curious
and watching this Hey
thank you because we actually couldn't
have done any of this without you guys
by the time this wave is over there will
be more than 30 people working at the
two companies combined and you guys
support them all thank you
you rock down to business then if you
prefer to read rather than watch a video
hey what are you doing here and B go to
the link in the video description where
you will find detailed job postings for
all of the available positions for the
rest of you here are the things that
everybody needs one a positive attitude
to great problem-solving skills
3 the ability to work with a team or
independently for strong communication
skills and 5 a sense of humor if you
have ever on ironically used either the
term fascist zealot or hippie lib tard
you can close your browser now
preferably for good let's start then
with our trips let's start with our grip
position Branden hurt his back don't
don't worry he's gonna get better it's
fine
but we still recognize that we need
someone to come in and help with rigging
both in our lighting grid and on our
sets at the start you'll mostly need
your knowledge of set and lighting
equipment but it's possible you'll end
up rigging up a camera at some point so
a certain level of understanding of
different types of camera builds and
gimbal setups is important or actually
you might even end up holding a camera
in the future so experience shooting
whether it's DSLR read or Eng /
camcorder type cameras also a plus next
up ed insists that we need another
editor shooter so here we're expecting
advanced skills in Adobe Premiere Pro
After Effects and addition and at least
basic knowledge of illustrator and
Photoshop once again DSLR red and Eng
camcorder type camera experience is
great along with some basic lighting
knowledge and I mean while we're
searching for you
corne we recognize that our audio could
be better so knowledge of audio editing
and production or recording is
definitely a huge plus
then there's Colton who curiously also
wants a video editor with camera skills
so this bot is part-time for now with
future potential for full-time work and
will involve working with our sales team
to create videos for clients channels as
well as help out with sponsored stuff
for our own moving on it has been two
years since our last call for writers
and we are expanding the writing team
again so there are either one or two
positions open here and the skillset
that we're looking for is kind of
open-ended obviously you need to have
strong writing skills an analytical mind
and a deep love of Technology in general
but it's the specializations that are
more likely to set you apart
are you a Linux tinkerer a maker a
hobbyist chip designer do you have a
passion for home automation I want to
hear about it oh and Alex says he'd love
to get someone with an electrical
engineering background so yeah we'll see
how that goes which brings us finally to
floatplane which by the way no is not
dead at all so we've got two positions
to fill here we're looking for an
infrastructure developer with strong
aptitudes in Linux what does RHEL or our
hell alright y'all cool thanks thanks
Luke experience with orchestration tools
like ansible chef puppet terraform
kubernetes and we also like them to have
an understanding of virtualization and
networking and then second we're looking
to fill a more general developer
position as well for this one we'd like
to see strong experience with JavaScript
specifically nodejs and angular 2 plus
along with knowledge of Redis and
MongoDB rata Sarita's he doesn't know
that's fine
finally and I'm not living this part
because I ran out of time to script it
before wine show he's waiting for me we
are kind of looking to become you know
not just Linus and then media and then
like group we want to be like like
first and then like the line of stuff so
we are just kind of open to your
interesting ideas do you have like a
passion for creating online video
outside of tech even you know maybe
you're more into like toys or games or
life hacks or music or honestly we don't
really care and are you looking to join
our team slash get a project funded um
feel free to reach out about that too we
are we are open to ideas in a way that
we've never really been able to before
as we are continuing to grow our team
and that's something that you know who
knows if you've got an amazing work
ethic and a great idea and you want to
join a what I think is a super fantastic
team then we'd like to hear from you as
well so that's it thanks for watching
I'm not gonna finish my standard outro
because I have to go do Rancho goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
