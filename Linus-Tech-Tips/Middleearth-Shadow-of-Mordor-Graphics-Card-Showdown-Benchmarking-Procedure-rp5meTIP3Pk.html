so with there are actually new games
season officially upon us it's time for
our first game performance video since
we did watch dogs way back in May of
this year welcome to our guide to the
best graphics cards for middle-earth
shadow of Mordor on PC corsair gaming
RGB keyboards feature precision Cherry
MX RGB key switches for sixteen point
eight million color / key backlighting
for virtually unlimited customization
click now to learn more there are a
couple of things we're changing this
time around first up we're going to
continue to run overclocked graphics
cards for our nuts-and-bolts video card
overviews since those are more geared
towards tweakers anyway but we're going
to start starting today running all
cards at stock for our game specific
showdowns since most gamers shopping for
a new graphics card to play a specific
game probably won't be overclocking
anyway second with 4k becoming more
affordable all the time we're going to
be adding 4k to our standard 1080p
testing this will be particularly
relevant for gamers who are picking up a
4k monitor or are about to soon but also
for gamers who are running brand new
high-end graphics cards like the gtx 970
or 980 from nvidia who want to leverage
dynamic super resolution nvidia z' new
feature that essentially is super sample
anti-aliasing but is a little bit easier
to use speaking of the 970 in the 980
that leads me to this sweet shirt i'm
wearing you guys should check out the
link in the video description if you
want Sambi linus and luke shirt if you
were there for the mod 24 pc modding
livestream event that we hosted it was
pretty cool it's pretty fun if you made
it through it the way that we did even
though we looked like this by the end of
it then check out the link in the
description for a shirt anyway without
further ado here's my co survivor Luke
to tell you about shadow of mordor
performance things showed us of mordor
is a third-person hack-and-slash
open-world game which is getting rave
reviews which makes sense when it's
being compared to giants like Batman and
Assassin's Creed it seems very well
optimized for PC and
even has an integrated benchmark for us
PC folks but as usual we'll be doing our
own benchmark anyways so stay tuned to
the end of the video if you want to see
how your graphics card stacks up against
the currently available options we're
using our usual graphics card test bench
to demonstrate the differences between
graphics cards by removing bottlenecks
elsewhere in the system so keep that in
mind when looking at the charts
we'll start with 1080p performance this
game is very well optimized and ran like
a dream on every card we tested it at
very high presets with medium textures
and no motion blur in fact two of our
cards the GTX 970 and 980 even bumped up
against the 100 FPS limit on their
maximums that unfortunately is built
into this game so when looking at these
numbers keep in mind that the average
frame rates could have been a little
higher for both of these cards at 4k the
observation that we made about how
amazingly well optimized the game is
continues even though frame rates were
much lower partially because we
increased resolution and partially
because we cranked the game settings
even higher the game just feels smooth
especially when compared to other games
even we're not running at 60fps and even
as low as 30 to 40 fps and on top of
that we Lotus we notice very little
tearing without g-sync or vsync or any
kind of frame rate limiting technology
so now we'll show you guys how we got
our numbers so you can replicate it on
your own I like to do a quick tour of
the in-game settings before we start
though because they're straight badass
every in-game visual setting has its own
little explanation of what it does and
how it impacts performance even giving
suggestions in some cases for how to get
the most out of your game with your
system like my favorite example of this
is the way that they suggest different
levels of texture quality depending on
the amount of RAM your graphics card has
and then go as far as to not expect you
to know how much you have
they put a handy little indicator in the
corner one reason they might have done
this is that performance really tanks in
a way we have rarely seen if you
configure texture quality too high for
your video frame buffer our save point
is at a respawn point which I believe
all save points are at I would try to be
more specific about where exactly this
is but I would probably have some
spoilers it is pretty close to the
beginning of the game so it's not all
that hard to get to we were thinking
about doing the benchmark in the open
world but the open world is very
randomized which is I'm sure great
for gameplay but not great for
benchmarking also weather effects
heavily in packed game performance so we
decided to do the benchmark within this
kind of instanced mission that we're
running to right now which you can kind
of see on screen because the weather is
constant inside the mission and there's
no random spawning or at least there's
not a ton of rain responding within the
mission so it's called the slaver will
just accept and start the mission here
little bit sassy but ok so we do
actually really need to kill the archers
or else during this benchmark we'll get
rekt so you're going to want to take a
there's usually a guy that spawns there
there's often at least one guy that
spawns on the far side and one trick is
to climb up here before anyone really
notices you and to go the other Archer
across over here and then you don't have
to waste one of your fairly valuable
arrows take him out and then you can
just kind of drop on everyone from this
little rope bridge thing what we're
gonna want to do now is they didn't
notice me okay it still hooks me okay
what works aren't necessarily the
smartest people around so Wow okay
here we go all right so what we're going
to want to do is thin the herd a little
bit so start this off by just kind of
going on a little bit of a rampage which
I don't think anyone's really gonna have
a problem with because you want to kind
of bring it down to three or four five
around there
orcs you don't want a whole bunch around
you is that'll be slightly abnormally
taxing on your graphics card and if you
just have a somewhat fixed number then
it'll be fine
the combat in this game is very Batman
like with the blocks so just be ready to
be blocking a fair amount but there is
no real timer or wait time on your block
at all so it's actually not that hard
all right so now we're down to these two
dudes they'll get some reinforcement so
I'm just gonna kind of sit here and
block and wait for reinforcements to
show up now this guy's here it's it's
probably go time
so what I do is kind of stand on the
right side of this pole and just block
while looking off into the distance from
the entire benchmark there we go there's
a fourth guy because it's pretty
consistent I just sit here blocking
looking in the same spot it simulates
about the same amount of demand as a
normal fight would if I was running
around stabbing things but then it's not
as randomised as having the screen
spinning all over the place which would
make it not very easy to replicate that
being said the frame rate in this game
is extremely consistent so even if I did
kind of swing the screen around it
probably wouldn't make a ton of a
difference but I do have this benchmark
within 0.01 FPS every run so I do want
to keep it as consistent as possible but
it is a really cool thing that this game
is able to keep really consistent frame
rates pretty much no matter what you're
doing and having only really things like
amount of characters on screen and
weather affected heavily
you're going to not want to die I
thought that was essentially a death
save that I had to go through right
there you don't want to have to do that
because that can actually affect your
framerate so yeah you have to be able to
survive for two minutes the blocking is
really not that difficult those who
should be fine
another thing you don't want to do is
that so you don't want to hold right
click you just want to tap it if you
hold right click you'll go into your
kind of wraith mode and that will
definitely affect framerate as well and
other than that the rest of the
benchmark is pretty much just standing
on the right side of this pole with the
prisoner on it trying to defend yourself
by blocking don't worry about saving the
prisoner though how do you think you can
all right guys thanks for watching don't
forget to check the link in the
description down below for the shirt
Linus is wearing which I will hopefully
be getting later also let me know what
you think about the new testing
methodology for games in the comments
down below while you're down there like
dislike favorite subscribe I think
subscribe is wider
either way share maybe if you want to
comment on the video you can comment
here or on the forum if you like
commenting on the forum but you don't
like the ads you can become a
contributor and while you're there if
you click the like help Linus media
group button thing in the kind of mid
right-hand side you can change all of
your Amazon links bookmarks to to our
affiliate code to help us out in the
future thanks again for watching I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
