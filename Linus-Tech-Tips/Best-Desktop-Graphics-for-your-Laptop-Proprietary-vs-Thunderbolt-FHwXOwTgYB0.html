stillborn or still relevant well we've
got two identical expect laptops and
both of the top external graphics Docs
that are ready to battle it out each
armed with a top-of-the-line NVIDIA GTX
1080 Ti
but will the identical specs yield
identical results for once no no they
won't
the be quiet pure bass 600 features a
versatile design noise insulation and
optimizations for different liquid
cooled radiator configurations learn
more at the link below first we need to
explain why we're using such opie
graphics cards the goal here was to
expose any weaknesses or efficiency
differences between these two by
eliminating the graphics card itself as
a bottleneck and also to make sure that
both of them can keep even the power
hungriest cards safely fed each are
equipped with plenty of power the razor
core sports a custom 500 watt power
supply while the Alienware graphics
amplifier has a hunt key for 60 watt ATX
power supply that was clearly made for a
full system and repurposed for this the
coarse aluminum chassis feels solid and
opening it up to insert the graphics
card only takes a couple of minutes
whereas the graphics amplifier well
everything about that setup frankly felt
a little janky the build is all plastic
and although I had the right idea for
opening it I actually ended up having to
consult the user manual because it felt
like I was going to break it oh God when
it got stuck halfway I mean there isn't
even RGB lighting on this one for crying
out loud and if you fought the poor ease
of use for the amplifier was over think
again the connectors on the proprietary
cable that carries a PCI Express 3.0 x4
signal from the computer to the dock
have these latches that can actually get
caught if you're not careful when you're
removing them not to mention that
Alienware solution requires a restart of
the laptop whenever you connect or
disconnect it so that the internal
dedicated graphics card can be activated
or disabled Razer on the other hand
keeps up their strong performance in
this area just plug in a
under bolt three cable into the blade
notebook of your choice
they don't officially support third
party laptops but we'll discuss that
more later install the Nvidia drivers
and you're good to go every part of the
process felt smoother and more polished
on the razor side though if it's
performance can hold up I suspect many
will forgive the Alienware graphics
amplifier for its lack of a spit and
shine given that it retails for 200
bucks a whopping three hundred dollars
less than the core though in razors
defense with the purchase of a blade
laptop you do get $100 off so I guess
it's only twice the cost of the graphics
amplifier let's get to the test every
game benchmark was run ten times in a
row to reward strong thermal performance
and we recorded both the average and the
minimum frame rate that was maintained
97% of the time we used identical
drivers and settings and a Seuss's 240
hertz gaming display for both systems
everything between them was equal except
for one thing
gaming performance for rise of the Tomb
Raider and for honor the Alienware
pulled out a bit ahead of the core while
the core actually pulled slightly ahead
in the all-important minimum FPS metric
but where things really got interesting
was in Ghost Recon wildlands and Deus Ex
mankind divided where the Alienware
graphics amplifier showed that it has
the potential to absolutely Bank the
core delivering buttery visuals compared
to the questionably playable performance
on razer solution and as a
troubleshooting step then we tried
comparing them using the built-in laptop
display rather than an external monitor
but this changed nothing for Alienware
and then generated even slightly lower
performance for razer due to the extra
displace
signal data being carried back to the
blades display something that we
actually tested more thoroughly in the
razor core deep dive which you can check
out here so what gives well we could
only think of two differences between
these solutions that might affect
performance one thermals either of the
cpu in the laptop or the graphics card
in the enclosure and two the connection
to the graphics card so to see if
thermal throttling was the issue we
booted up i-264
and monitored temperatures on our blade
while gaming it got hot but it was
nowhere near overheating then to rule
out the laptop entirely
we gave our 7600 HQ equipped blade pro a
shot but it performed nearly identically
within our margin of error no dice let's
move on to that connection then the
theoretical bandwidth of the two should
be equal in gpu-z both have the same
number of PCIe lanes and the same
reported 40 gigabit per second bandwidth
is there some way that we could pin this
on Thunderbolt 3 what if the Gigabit
Ethernet controller on the core is
sucking up resources we used disabling
device manager and it was not very
effective so it was time to go
spelunking deep into the depths of the
specs searching for a single difference
between the two and finally we found one
in the dark crevices of the device
manager on the Alienware
amplifier the GPU gets connected
directly to the PCIe controller on the
CPU so the lanes that it gets are solely
devoted to graphics the Razer core on
the other hand gets connected through
the motherboard chipset meaning that the
graphics card has to share its PCIe
lanes and perhaps more importantly the
DMI interface with things like
networking USB ports and probably the
biggest bandwidth sucker storage but can
we prove one
and for all that the lanes are causing
the bottleneck for a complete
apples-to-apples comparison we needed to
be able to connect the core to the
Alienware 13 something Dale doesn't want
you to do in spite of the 13th higher
end four-lane implementation of the
Thunderbolt 3 standard good news though
it turns out that if you disabled enough
Alienware services it will be grudgingly
let you use a razor core and in games
the Alienware 13 connected to the core
recorded results within our margin of
error
proving then that the bottleneck wasn't
in the laptop but in the connection
itself so final pros and cons list then
razor has some big advantages there
simple setup and hot swap ability will
definitely win over customers who value
ease-of-use and the excellent
compatibility enabled by using a
standard Thunderbolt 3 connection in
spite of advertising the core is only
working with their own blade and blade
stealth makes them the default winner
for many but if you're willing to look
the other way on build quality a little
bit you're willing to shell out for a
matching Alienware laptop and you want
the best no compromises performance out
of your graphics dock at a much lower
price the amplifier comes out way ahead
