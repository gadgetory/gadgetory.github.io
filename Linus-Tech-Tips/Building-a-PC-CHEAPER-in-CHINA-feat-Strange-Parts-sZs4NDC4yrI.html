fantastic alright so I'm here at hua
Xiong Bay yeah perfect thank you
where's Scotty from strange part so I'm
getting me some strange parts yeah in
China which is actually exactly what
we're doing so in this like gigantic
tech mall thing they have everything
from components like switches to
computer parts to drones to
cryptocurrency crap mobile phones pretty
much you name it they've got it here so
I don't really have any objective other
than to go shopping and see exactly what
it is that I can buy with my little
stack of Canadian rubles here so uh wish
me luck and hopefully that's not for me
yeah I think we're good
this video is brought to you by Corsairs
subsidiary it's a mid-tower gaming case
featuring premium tempered glass and
aluminum construction removable table
fan trays and more check it out at the
link below I think this is gonna be an
uphill battle to get them to even
recognize what those are let alone know
the value of them like what is this yeah
yeah right yep this is the world's most
helpful error message the transaction is
cancelled for some reason operation
timeout thank you okay so like this is
the kind of stuff that I wish we had a
shop like this like we were trying to do
a piece a little while ago where we
wanted lit buttons all or like like big
fun buttons that we could press and if
we could have just walked into a mall
and bought them that would have made my
main risk
the cool thing about here particularly
for buttons is you can actually come in
and touch them right so you like the
button feel is super important oh my god
I already found something I need entire
bags of motherboard standoffs
I was trying to buy just a bag of
computer screws only place I could find
for it was on eBay pricing was totally
unreasonable yeah it will be very
reasonable here smartwatches yep totally
100% real beats these are probably like
somebody my real semi real yeah like
refurb type right okay yeah wow this
place is enormous
crazy right this is probably one of 20
buildings honestly it's overwhelming
yeah okay so here's stuff I mostly
recognize right here there's like a
bunch of mining gear you know I can't
miners and what else do they go mining
power supplies get an Apple cash
machines
ROG something something looks like very
similar skews yep
I'm just looking just looking I know I'm
just looking around it's okay thank you
I mean this is the kind of thing you
would never find in a retail store back
home this is like dual socket like
server boards and stuff like that can
you ask how much this 1800 watt power
supply is don't rush in to go eager
there's like 50 bucks 50 bucks yeah
$50 for an 1800 watt power supply yeah
it doesn't feel like in 1801 oh my god
it's actually only rated for 1600 also
this is a mining only power supply so it
only does 12 volt this is just Almighty
these are mining specific cards right
here these ones without coolers and they
actually do have a display out but like
just the one Wow look at this stuff yeah
so they've got things like these mining
specific boards and this is used a demo
board here's a brand of motherboard that
I've certainly never heard of sometimes
it's just fascinating like you walk up
to a booth and you kind of go what are
you doing you know like if you really
need a B 250 M H d3 or a WD green SSD or
a bison fan then you're good but like so
I mean this is indicative of the markets
which is just like a high degree of
specialization in booths but it's also
just like a different way of doing
business there's just not a lot of like
vertical integration it's everybody does
their one little thing and has friends
that do the other it's fundamental
problem for PC stuff is that what's this
pricing across regions has really
leveled out yeah that's a wonderful
question I'm next
sure what this is doesn't seem to be in
any sort of hurry to tell these TMF is
this a tough like totem gear I mean they
still have LGA 775 motherboards here
like brand-new that's incredible
oh wow okay I can't even like focus my
eyes at one point she was burning paper
with one of these so just be careful
oh yeah it's this one how much is that
one this one yeah I don't know I'll ask
me oh here we go oh my god
watch the reflections on the glass I
think my kids would end up going blind
if they found it yes yes that's true
yeah I'll pass I'll pass on this one oh
yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah I'm okay
I'm okay I'm okay
yeah if I decide okay okay okay my
recommendation is if you think you want
something you should just buy it well
while you're there yeah so what I
figured out at this point is I
definitely need some kind of an
objective because you could wander
around in here for weeks and still have
no idea where the hell you are
and I have so yeah if you have something
specific you want to do I'm happy to try
and make that happen as best we can
okay I want the cheapest laptop in this
entire mode
cheapest laptop in the entire me yeah
let's do that
let's see how usable it is yeah okay I'm
trying to think where we would go for
that
um but yeah okay let's maybe jump
buildings sure as you've seen this one
to the other place that has a lot of
laptops and stuff okay sounds good yeah
it's an unusual thing going into
somewhere with the objective to buy the
worst thing that you can find I mean if
they weren't trying I don't know how
they could have made two completely
different buildings full of completely
different people and things look so
identical once you start coming here
more it does actually like you do notice
differences there is a different mix of
stuff here
but right but it's a different mix it's
not fundamentally different yes it is
subtle
laptops he wants to buy cheap laptop
laptop yeah actually yeah Eric can you
jump in okay we want the cheapest
possible laptop like so one problem here
where the really nice guy from upstairs
directed us is that none of this is
off-brand this is like Lenovo Samsung a
sous tell this is a start set 6000 what
yen Arnie RMB 1 yeah that's about 6 - 1
2 / 6 it's about $1,000 okay well I mean
that's about what like an ende would
start at back at home like I don't think
we're gonna find anything that weird and
or cheap here tell you what
what do you edit your videos on final
cut or premiere my final cuts might I've
had enough choice but my editor uses
premier here's what we're doing we're
building an editing rig for strange
parts as editor because when in doubt
and I can't figure out what to make a
video about I just build a computer well
so it no that's what we're doing
let's do it
so that's looks let's go back to PC
component okay go back upstairs hear any
sure so my editor is in Mexico could be
my editing rig or my transcoder like I
don't care what you do with it okay well
your editors gonna watch this video so
if you don't send it to them then you
know what guys it's true
I'm gonna have to sort that out oh no
Linus has stars in his eyes here oh my
god who's looking devious I think I've
fallen in love it's actually like the
construction of this is not bad - like
from a distance it looked like like
plastic garbage but it's actually
aluminum gutters lights proper yeah so
it's exhaust going out either side with
these like baffles and then the whole
thing is a big intake Wow
how much is a Ferrari definitely real
Ferrari power supply to go with it dang
let's look around a little more
I mean we might find something else but
I don't know if I could love anything
more than that case sorry hon I'm
feeling good we're off to a very good
start here look at this stuff
that is some ghetto ass water cooling
supplies oh what's the point of having
something on display if you can't sell
it oh wow that radiator weighs almost
nothing that is aluminum AF and I
actually don't even know if this hear
that crackling okay 15 bucks for this
though not that bad
not that bad okay let's continue our
quest that's jumping out at me as having
sufficient RGB nests okay this that is
my kind of RGB and looks a lot more
sensible in terms of pricing as well
okay I expected that okay that's pretty
cool it doesn't actually have a
microphone though that is totally
cheating the truth yeah that's just
cheating
so that so the question was like should
we haggled over this right and so my
rule of thumb is like if I think it's a
fair price then I don't like I don't
push on it fine most people in the
market are not like marking stuff up
because it's like a sale there's just
not the expectation that like critically
buying one that they're gonna like I
mean really got you but one thing I need
to know is if I have anywhere to mount
my radiator inside so Eric can you ask
him if I can take it down and open it up
okay you should be in pretty good shape
okay yep I'm sold what's good to me
so I know I said that you don't screw
around on the power supply in the
motherboard yeah but I am definitely
gonna be finding brands that I don't
recognize for both of them okay because
we are gonna have we're gonna have the
Chinese PC experience Wow colorful makes
motherboards yeah that's fun ah okay so
I want to know how much for that one
it's a battle ax I don't know what the
brand is I can't read it but it says
battle ax on it yeah that's a brown one
at the bottom there's nothing on here
that would indicate sort of what it is
but it does have USB three colorful oh
it's a colorful world okay do you do you
have anything bigger full ATX here why
don't we why don't we just pick up a
board here let's just let's just talk to
our buddy here yeah
all right do you have a motherboard CPU
memory okay I'm gonna try that again
this what motherboards do you have do
you have anything like full-size ATX
more slots
what about memory okay so that's an 8
gig Kingston stick weight it's 100 bucks
for one stick okay no hold on yeah I
don't think that's very good pricing I
think we can do better elsewhere
you gotta start buying stuff but we're
gonna run a time here does anyone here
speak English no I think that one's okay
okay so we're reaching a deal on rising
chip and be 350 motherboard but if I
understand correctly he doesn't have
stock here he's just gonna go to one of
the other stores and buy it so maybe or
there's a storeroom somewhere else
that's pretty common - it's like
there'll be another booth somewhere that
has the stock that's less like visible
than they take this I want to go back to
shopping on behind fun fact we're paying
more than the other guy quoted us but at
this point I don't care
fine so here's the situation we have
like 20 minutes before this whole place
closes down we have like 2,500 RMB left
to get a GPU storage a power supply and
a cooler because clearly this tubing is
not gonna do us any good I hate this
this is not a great shopping experience
that I'm having I am stressed out okay
so these guys have Galax 1060 s let's
find out how much Galax is he quoting mm
yeah
okay we're gonna have a casually on hold
on a second worst-case scenario all we
still need is storage and power supply
because we can use the stockroom where
okay we can just pull this radiator in
the back for lulz and I'm gonna need a
screwdriver well the other option is to
go find our repair boots and deal I'd
like you and a Chinese guy putting this
together together that's an option I
think we'll have to move on we don't
want that I'm determined to get the rest
of the stuff here so here we go we need
SSD power supply do you have 10 16 is
that it
oh okay so 23 60 that's a little better
and then I can't even tell what the
wattage of these things are 600 watt all
right so we'll take this one we're
definitely getting at least one product
where I don't recognize the brand at all
I've never heard of an attack on Eric's
trying to get a 60 r&amp;amp;b off and he's
offering us 10 which is about $2 $2
discount fine I don't care anymore okay
okay fine we got a two dollar discount
man you know like 10 years from now I'm
gonna I'm gonna have like $2 I'm gonna
like desperately need it to take a bus
somewhere yep and that's gonna be all I
have and I mean really thank God Eric
saved me that $2 on that power supply
SSD what is the total over here it was
30 30 50 can I owe you some money okay
all right do we need to go back and get
our motherboard CPU combo so we've got a
small problem the escalator is caged up
now this place is closing in like two
minutes and we have to go down to the
bottom floor to the ATM we may not be
able to go back to the store that is a
potential bar so we might walk out of
here with a case it would be kind of a
dick move we set them around the markets
all day that's right I think well I
think we'll get anywhere to make it work
all right this is what we got this is
these three
okay so check everything yep yeah Rison
seven 1702 ddr4 eight gig sticks yep
that's and then we've got a B 350 plus
yep okay all right so you're getting
probably hopefully a decent computer
here cool I don't know about that power
supply you check the first couple to
make sure they were really you know I
mean I'm surprised he's not running it's
her machine actually cuz oh he's gonna
go write it through a machine no like
yeah that's just a universal concern
it's definitely not you like hopefully
this last piece of the puzzle is really
simple we just need a Phillips head
screwdriver I know where to get that but
it's in a different building it's in a
different building I mean they must have
a Phillips screwdriver hey let's go walk
around the bottom floor like if we go
offer someone 15 yes we can buy a shop
we can buy a shop screwdriver that would
be an option
this one right here yeah sure okay okay
but should we just go to the other
building yeah okay fine let's just go
where we know they're gonna have it all
right let's go back to that big tool
booth I think the odds of that case
having all tooless mounts is very slim
yeah
oh is that your tool sport this is one
yeah I'm gonna open they look very open
okay I'm gonna buy it actually don't see
that many options here small
screwdrivers the screwdriver with an S
3:13 used to all like lots of precision
screwdrivers for working on phones but
we just want like a normal like
expertise
here we go here oh here we go we walked
right past screwdriver land all the way
in
okay here's a super long one you know
what I could actually use one of these
okay yeah I'll take this shank I mean
screwdriver sorry looks wait whatever
see this
they're both reversed now they're both
going down we caught it by like two
minutes we were about to get kicked out
of this place so mister can build an
iPhone out of parts that he finds in
Shenzhen when's the last time you built
a computer it's been 15 years 15 years
okay so can you build a computer yeah
that's a great question I I would like
to think I still can I bought but it has
been a long time it has been multiple
multiple generations
I bought the screwdriver for you I'm
gonna be in charge of unboxing okay and
you're gonna be in charge of actually
building this now all right I think
you're already doing my job my rights
whole Calabro - takes division of
responsibilities very carefully okay so
here we can let me let me just do a
quick overview of our case here yeah so
this case is from the brand power train
so we were successful on the case front
we found something that I had never
heard of before
it's the chameleon and honestly for a
$40 case the fact that it has RGB
lighting not that bad feel a little
weird assembling a computer in the
middle of Market Square but this is
totally normal there's they'll be like
there's iphone repair going on at
McDonald's down there okay we might have
run up against our first challenge you
actually need to pull out these two
standoffs and they are freaking tight so
one option and I have used this with
success before is to take a motherboard
screw here right and screw it in too
much like to seize it yep in the
stand-up and then try it back off the
standoff
it's worth shot whoa oh that looks good
not one that looks good okay but we're
gonna sacrifice another screw here oh oh
you're lucky man there you go these are
these are seized as hell like without
pliers and yeah we're not getting that
out anymore but all right so while
Scottie screws in the motherboard I'm
gonna go through everything else we got
here so this is a bit of a cheat I had
heard of Great Wall but it is a Chinese
friend I don't think I've ever seen a
great wall power supply available
outside of China wow you've got a
modular power supply there you go then
modular cable huh yeah is it clicking we
need fancy I would say that goes down
here right yes it does we can get it in
there we need to pull this off you know
we don't have we're gonna slide it in
yep
you know what we have to do is find out
how good of a deal we got I'm willing to
say a little bit more expensive than the
states but I'm not sure
Oh our case did not include any cooling
fans and we blew our money on a radiator
in our stock right if we're double
teaming on assembly then I'm gonna
double team on unboxing here no wonder
your projects take you eight months
being an idiot doesn't help okay HyperX
fury all right we ready to pop this in
and then put cards
oh that's almost in okay we're in it's
like actually getting dark enough that
I'm having trouble seeing now yeah can
you flash lately did I just not say
flash light you because like not on
camera so he showed us the graphics card
but I didn't realize it was like a brown
box card like it the cardi showed us
looked legit but made in China gtx 1060
oh this is a system integrator skew so
he sold us an OEM card that rat bastard
so this probably doesn't have as much
warranty on it
again that problem yeah I actually like
the screwdriver are you compensating for
something okay
now I promised that I was putting this
damn radiator in no matter oh yeah you
did
so I'm doing it it's not gonna do
anything but it's gonna be in there
we need our tubing as well right yeah
hell yeah you know like that right I
would just run it back right into the
other one just like that yeah yeah yeah
I want you want to fall illusion yeah I
want just run that baby right there
there I mean looks kind of water-cooled
right
yeah you think totally water yeah yeah
thank you buddy water cool all right
yeah I'm gonna show you a cable
management secret show me I love cable
management okay so this is the moment
where I find out if this was a good deal
or a ripoff Oh so I had to make some
compromises with my new egg equivalent
so I used a Roseville power supply with
sort of similar specs
I picked like the second cheapest
generic SSD I could find and then for a
case honestly they were better deals
 really I could get a case for 38
u.s. dollars okay which is less than
what we paid yeah this what I would have
paid 1142 how did we do - we did 1162
plus two dollars and 50 cents for the
screwdriver so it was basically the same
well that was fun was I'm sure glad that
that was so stressful but here
congratulations do whatever you want
with it I no longer care I don't even
know if it works but it's water-cooled
you ask
it looks pretty watered it'll break very
water look closely at it so this video
is brought to you by private Internet
access which actually has been serving
me very very well on this trip see watch
I'm gonna do a thing I'm gonna go to
google.com wait for it
whoa whoa whoa what is that oh wow
that's google.com I'm in China so
private Internet access allows you to
access the internet more freely and more
openly wherever
you happen to be they support a variety
of VPN protocols and types of encryption
and authentication they've got apps for
Windows Mac OS Android iOS Linux and
Google Chrome would support four more
platforms coming soon you can connect up
to five devices at the same time so if
you travel with a couple of phones in a
laptop like me no problem whatsoever you
can have them all on it and you can even
get it for someone as a gift yes my
friends you can buy PIAA for your
friends and family and keep them more
secure online so check it out at the
link in the video description so thanks

video then you can hit that button but
if you liked watching me get stressed
out then hit that like button get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
this guy strange parts we're gonna have
this channel length in the video
