from the fact that it's difficult to
convince people it's awesome without
real hands-on time along with the cost
of high-end VR headsets to the fact that
while there are cool experiences the
basic versions most people have tried
like the gear VR frankly aren't that
great and even at the high end where the
experience is much better there aren't
exactly a ton of killer apps enter the
PlayStation VR Sony's solution that sits
squarely in between putting your phone
into a folded piece of cardboard and
dropping over $1500 on a VR PC gaming
solution
mass drop has teamed up with Sennheiser
to bring you their all-new HD 6 xx
headphones check them out in the link
below the PSV are at $500 for the whole
kit or $400 if you already have the
camera and move controllers is cheaper
than both the HTC vive and the oculus
rift but the big kicker here maybe not
for you and for me but for the gaming
consumer base as a whole is that it
works with the PlayStation 4 which has
sold over 40 million units in the last
three years making it the most popular
current generation console and therefore
inherently more likely a Christmas
present for holiday shoppers this year
let's start with the headset itself it
is the heaviest of the current major VR
headsets but it makes up for it with
some awesome mounting implementation it
feels more like you're just naturally
putting on a helmet or a hat due to the
automatically retracting plastic strap
that is fixed around your head to
tighten things up you can use the dial
on the back and there's a release button
as well for emergencies the tether has
inline controls for volume mic mute and
most importantly power along with a
headphone jack on the side these little
tweaks improve ease-of-use more than you
might expect though it's not the first
time the PC solution has felt more
designed by engineers for engineers
compared to the console one the only
downside here is that these little
features add a little bit more weight to
the cable increasing the anchor effects
that it creates not a huge deal but
noticeable after a while of being
immersed in VR as far as the screen goes
it's a lower resolution in the rift and
vibe with a single 1080p panel not one
screen for each eye like the others but
it must be noted that this is an OLED
panel meaning that while you'll
definitely notice jaggies or aliasing
the screen door effect the the black
lines between pixels is noticeable but
not nearly as prominent as you might
think
given the difference in panel resolution
I would say the screen is really solid
overall moving on you don't need the
PlayStation Move controllers you can
use the PlayStation gamepad and for most
things that's going to be fine they can
even track in VR thanks to the light
that's on the back of it and it can be
used for some basic in-game hand
presence that being said there are
experiences that really do need them and
having individual hand tracking
definitely boosts your immersion
it's a shame however that they haven't
made any improvements since the moves
original release in 2010 as an accessory
for the PlayStation 3 they're just so
far behind the hand controllers for the
vive and rift not only in organ ama
cosine the shape and button placement
but in terms of tracking the tracking of
all these items including the headset
isn't great in my testing I did
encounter some jittering and a few
tracking issues but it wasn't that bad
overall but that being said Nick light
and kolten Potter had motion sickness
that left them queasy after about 40
minutes of using it this is a your
mileage may vary type of thing however
so it may be not as bad for you or it
could be worse all of that being said
you can help the tracking along you
simply need to dim the lights or even
better yet turn them off all together
this will help the PlayStation camera
track the LEDs on your gear the brighter
the room the worse the tracking will be
these things are very dependent if you
want the best tracking experience play
in a very dark room and then we have the
ever misunderstood breakout box I want
to set the record straight here the box
is not responsible for asynchronous time
warp or reprojection or anything like
that the ps4 handles reprojection
itself but the breakout box does is grab
sensor data manage 3d audio and split
the image all of which is good and
useful there just seem to be a lot of
people who thought it was doing
something else finally we get to the
experiences and how it all comes
together stuff like Batman Arkham vr is
great but it only lasts for about an
hour
Sony's ownership of IP like this gives
them a ton of options for the future but
right now I really don't feel like
they're using it to its full potential
go further with it make an awesome
Batman game that makes people really
want to
to the platform make it go a lot deeper
than just pointing at things and holding
a button and I know looking at yourself
in the mirror as Batman going I'm Batman
over and over again is amazing but when
that's all the depth to the game
I want more overall the system could be
described as good enough at least for
what they're trying to do if you already
own a PlayStation 4 the cost might not
be an insurmountable obstacle especially
if your little sister already talked you
into buying a PlayStation camera and
move controllers that that would be
helpful the experience is not as
mind-blowing as the vibe or the rift but
the cost is proportionately lower but
thanks to its ability to project the TV
natively automatically from the box
right away others in the room can have
fun along with you which is great
you can also accept any HDMI input and
its potential for more immersive
experiences with superior head tracking
given appropriate lighting compared to
like a gear VR or something like that
it's pretty cool if you already own a
Playstation 4 then you're looking for
something new to try I don't think the
price is unreasonable so maybe it's
something to consider the chefsteps
joule is a sous-vide tool that helps you
cook perfect food every time without the
stress by cooking at a precise
temperature you cannot over or under
cook your food which makes cooking
things like fish chicken and even steaks
a breeze to use it place your meat or
fish in a normal ziploc freezer bag and
seal it with all the seasonings that
you'd like inside fill a pot with water
and then place the jewel in the pot open
up the jewel app on your phone and
select what you're cooking and how you
want it cooked my favorite feature that
the jewel has is visual doneness which
makes this that you can see exactly what
the meat will look like when cut open at
all of the various temperatures which is
really helpful even if you are a very
skilled cook the jewel is available now
for holiday gifting check it out in the
link below alright guys thanks for
watching this video like it if you liked
it dislike if you disliked to get
subscribed all that kind of fun stuff I
know it's a VR headset for a console and
most you guys are PC guys and I am too
but it is cool to see the whole spectrum
of devices as they come along and it is
exciting
because it's actually not that bad and
having actually not that bad be a thing
in VR and hopefully more people buy it
that could bring more development cost
to like PC I don't know it could work
out in the end if you want to discuss
all the things I said and debate
consoles versus PCs hopefully not
aggressively go to the forum link in the
video description down below while
you're there check out the link for the
shirts and stuff that are here if you
want to buy a psvr or something like
that there's also an amazon link for you
as well if you'd like to see another
video on the HTC vive or the HTC 5
versus oculus rift video or the oculus
rift video itself or whatever Tarin
decides to put here you can click on
that and yeah I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
