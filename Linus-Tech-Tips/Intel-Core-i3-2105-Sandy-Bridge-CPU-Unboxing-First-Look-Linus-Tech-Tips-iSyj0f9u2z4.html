going to be doing an unboxing of the
Intel Core i3 2105 now this is a low-end
processor so it might not seem like it
would be that interesting to you but it
is and I will tell you why this is part
of their second generation Core I series
processors so that means that it uses
the Sandy Bridge core and it has
integrated graphics on every single one
whether it's a dual core or quad core
this one in particular is a dual core
but I want you guys to come in here and
have a quick look at this so you've got
two cores you do have hyper threading so
that means you've got four threads until
HD graphics 3000 that's the interesting
part so this is a lowland chip with a
high-end integrated graphics because
remember the second-generation core
series processors have either HD 2000 or
HD 3000 onboard graphics and the only
time we've seen HD 3000 in the past is
with the K series chips and quite
frankly if you're buying a
high-performance hyper-threaded
turbo-boost quad core processor what on
earth are you doing using your onboard
graphics in most cases so this is the
first SKU that has a mix then that I
believe makes the most sense which is
the low end CPU with the higher end
onboard graphics so high-end onboard
graphics please a couple of things first
of all it means better performance in
games obviously it's still integrated
graphics but it's on the cpu better
performance in games it also means
better performance in the the HD
graphics accelerated functionality such
as lucid virtu which is far more
interesting in my opinion than
necessarily the performance of an Intel
HD 3000 graphics solution very very cool
technology I'm gonna actually be doing a
video on virtue very shortly but III did
some media conversions with it very
impressive it's so fast okay we've got
an integrated memory controller with
support for up to dual channel ddr3
memory and a three-year limited warranty
so this is all pretty much stuff we're
used to now
show you guys the product itself really
quickly here but there's not going to be
that much interesting we've got a core
i3 sticker we've got an Intel certified
heatsink solution so this is a very
low-power CPU this particular little guy
is rated at 65 Watts TDP so you got a
really thin thermal solution no copper
slug necessary in the middle and you've
got a nice four pin pwm fan there and
last but not least look at this
environmentally friendly packaging
there's a little bit of plastic but
overall not bad definitely improving so
there we have it the core i3 2105 in all
of its glory it fits in your standard
LGA 1155 socket do not try to put this
in an 1156 board it will not work so the
main reason for me unboxing this is
actually because I want to put it up
head-to-head against AMD's apu so here i
have an 8 apu which is a 4 core
processor with discrete level graphics
and then this is Intel's price similar
to core processor also with B highest
and Intel onboard graphics now bear in
mind Intel CPUs have much higher
performance per core than AMD CPUs this
one does have the advantage of hyper
threading but this guy actually has four
physical cores so I think that's going
to be an interesting comparison which I
will also be doing in the near future as
well so don't forget to subscribe to
