probably seen this at the local mall
already so I'm probably not showing you
anything you've never seen before but we
are definitely beginning B gonna be
gonna be using the next few minutes to
find out just how anything they mean
about turning anything into a speaker so
now with a built-in rechargeable battery
this is the rocket 3.0 and it uses bins
boxes travel beds lamps cups milk
cartons anything you pretty much want to
turn it into a speaker so powered by a
built in rechargeable battery charge for
two hours and get up to 12 hours of play
the more hollow the object the better
the sound quality works with any audio
device has a senders three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack perfect for
lots of stuff and revolutionized the way
you listen to music speaker rocket I
thought that said rocket poo sounds like
rocket poo that's fantastic but it
actually says Rock - it pod rocket pod
and not rocket poo simply stick the
rocket pod from the rocket poo to any
object and transform it into a speaker
instantly by pressing play on your
device okay included is a rocket
portable vibration speaker something
else with a built-in lithium ion battery
a USB power and charging cord and two
extra sticky pads so here's the USB
charging cord here are the extra sticky
pads here's the rocket poo and here is
the user's manual which should be pretty
straightforward so this will sort of
connect to whatever thing we want to
connect it to and this will like do
something and you know what I'm gonna
have to figure this out sort of
separately here I'll be back in a moment
so it was more straightforward than we
thought all you have to do is just
unwind the cap to get the the cord to
come out and then you take off the
protective cover you stick it to
something and then you just play your
music over the okay so you can hear it's
pretty quiet right now but then if you
stick it to something
then it turns a box into a speaker or in
theory it turns a baby toy into a
speaker let's see if we can turn that up
somewhere well say you fell off hold on
there we go so in theory whatever you
stick it to turns into a speaker let's
see if this works
no that's not gonna work okay we'll go
try some other stuff like this badminton
trophy these are these pads aren't as
sticky as I would have hoped there you
go okay turn off for a second
so we're gonna try and actually connect
it to a speaker yeah doesn't work on
stuff that's built so solidly like Miami
Kev's here okay garbage can time okay so
recommend using the other included extra
sticky pads
okay so in conclusion works as
advertised thank you for checking out
