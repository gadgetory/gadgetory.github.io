lot of cool stuff but of course one of
the things that we're most passionate
about is gaming PC's so we've gone ahead
and we've created a couple of lists of
the top 5 gaming desktops that we saw
and the top 5 gaming laptops and this is
the latter our first of our top 5 Intel
based gaming laptops of CES 2016 is the
razor blade stealth and its accompanying
accessory the core so the stealth is
actually an ultrabook it's thin it's
light its compact at only about a half
an inch thick and 2.75 pounds but it
doesn't have a dedicated GPU more on
that in a moment
it features an exile a which is similar
to IPS at up to a 4k resolution it's got
perky RGB backlighting unlike many other
gaming laptops that are only the entire
thing or pers own and the pricing starts
at an impressive $9.99 for the base
model with Chazz a core i7 and a 1440p
screen and up to 50 99 for the 4k 512
gig model pricing that wouldn't be so
impressive if it wasn't so well built
okay back to the GPU the core accessory
is an external GPU enclosure that
connects via Thunderbolt 3 and gives any
video card you could pretty much want to
install a PCI Express 3.0 4x connection
in theory by the time it's released it
will be plug and play and you will
simply be able to plug it in without
rebooting and go from onboard graphics
to up to a GTX Titan X razor was in fact
demoing it with both your exhaust cards
and blower style cards and we don't have
any information about pricing but this
is one impressive little piece of
technology our second gaming laptop is
the Asus GX 700 it is a liquid-cooled
laptop need i say more
maybe not but I will it uses an external
dock with connectors at the back of the
laptop you just slide it in and use a
lever on the top to lock it in place
and start the coolant flow both the CPU
and GPU are water-cooled and the cooling
components inside use copper there are
two 90 millimeter radiators and heat
pipes can actually provide conventional
cooling when the laptop is not in the
water cooling dock the current design is
closed-loop meaning it's not meant to be
messed with but a more modifiable
version might be coming later on the
laptop itself features a desktop gtx 980
a 4k IPS display and 30 ki rollover just
in case you're playing with oh I don't
know
three people all at once it'll be
available no sooner than march 2016 in
the price is not going to be lower than
over two thousand dollars up next is the
EVGA SC 17 yes friends EVGA made a
gaming laptop considering that it has a
skylake mobile core i7 and a gtx 980m
it's not too bulky about an inch thick
and you get an option for a 4k screen at
a size of seventeen point four inches
it's got a 1080p front camera that'll be
nice for you game streamers out there
and EVGA is planning to bring g-sync
support to the main screen later on in
the year they are also touting quiet
performance while gaming as one of the
main features of this device and will be
available in late q1 the lenovo y 900 is
up next now lenovo is obviously more
known for their business nino books but
they are trying to appeal to gamers as
well and there aren't very many
compromises with this product you can
get an overclockable skylake i7 a couple
of 256 gig PCIe SSD s and raid 0 and a
gtx 980m is standard it's got a OneTouch
turbo button for quick overclocking
through the lenovo nerve center windows
application I like that nod to the old
days where you'd press the turbo button
on your 386
it features an IPS display and starts at
$2,000 with availability coming in June
there will also be a razer edition for a
little more money
very interesting the last of our top
five here is the gigabyte ARS x7 DT this
is very similar to the previous ARS x7
with the main difference being that
instead of SLI graphics cards it now
features a single oven videos new gtx
980 desktop graphics cards that fits in
a laptop and while that might not be
that new necessarily what I like about
the x7 dt is that unlike other desktop
gtx 980 notebooks it features a very
very slim profile they've also made some
other updates including adding USB
type-c to the side i/o making this a
pretty attractive looking piece thanks
