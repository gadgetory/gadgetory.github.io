gigabyte have released some fantastic
small form-factor gaming machines in the
last couple of years but they all have
the same disadvantage non-standard and
in many cases non upgradable components
no you have to leave it to the hardcore
enthusiasts pioneers like Lucas diakon
to break free from what has become the
way to build a small form-factor gaming
rig ITX motherboards with a single
graphics card are out M ATX motherboards
with dual graphic cards are in oh and
did I mention that this thing is liquid
cooled and under 15 liters making it
only slightly bigger than the Corsair
one so strap on my friends cuz this go
and be good
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description I feel like we
should start with one small problem
project or therus named for the
mythological Greek two-headed dog is not
for sale yet this one was actually built
by our friends at proto case they do
great work
the rackmount gaming case they built for
me is still going strong so it's no
surprise then that Lukas went to them
with his incredible design and they got
to work every component was laser-cut
in-house the front panel details and
rear i/o not to mention the badass front
logo were milled out the radiator holder
was routed out the motherboard tray and
SSD holder were bent they pressed in all
the rivets standoffs and threaded nuts
routered the side panel and put the
whole thing together with a beautiful
coat of their proto legacy black powder
coating a couple revisions of that and
this is what landed on our doorstep
still some assembly required though am i
right we actually needed to care
packages to assemble our case the one
from proto case that was unidentifiable
as a case other than the main chassis
frame and one from Lucas himself that
included among other things a server
power supply with custom rerouted
12-volt rails to support our dual
graphics cards and custom shorter cables
resisting is already way too cool we
haven't even settled again yours would
of course come in a much more finished
state though so we're going to fast
forward to system assembly front i/o was
pretty straightforward dual USB 2 and
dual USB 3 with HDMI pass-through for VR
and a dope-ass capacitive power button
our nice extras then it was time to move
on to core components
we chose an intel core i7 6900 k for
maximum PCIe bandwidth for the 2 PCI
Express 16x slots on our a seuss x99 mws
motherboard and I'm pretty sure the ws
stands for West Syed because this thing
is awesome we added a sprinkling of
coarser vengeance RGB memory on the side
for maximum FPS and our 240 millimeter a
i/o goes in next but due to width
limitations there is a mere 55
millimetres of height available for the
CPU block which is why we ended up using
an older generation Corsair h100 I
alright we're getting close now let's
pop the graphics cards in the design
comes with brackets to fit a pair of 2
and a half inch drives on the
motherboard side and a three and a half
inch drive plus another two and a half
inch to piggyback on top in the second
graphics card tray if you're not using
it but we are using it for twin GTX 10
atti founders editions so there will be
no junk in the backside for us these
shielded PCI Express risers go in now
note that one of them is actually more
narrow than the other in order for the
SLI bridges to fit then we install the
cards themselves it is a bit tricky as
the bottom card needs to be installed
first then have its custom spliced and
extended sli bridge is connected wrapped
behind the tray and then power it up the
extra length of the SLI cables actually
enables them to be hidden behind the
cards so you can show them off in their
full SLI glory now that the key
components are together it's time to
spruce the machine up with Mucho RGB and
tidy your cabling yeah looks like a fun
task in such a tiny case let's uh summon
the comrade oh that looked pretty easy
now let's check her out all
and in her maximum RGB glory ladies and
gents project orthrus revision3 so from
an idea to a 3d model to the lowest
displacement chassis to be able to run
GT x 1080 TI sli I don't think anything
could have prepared me for something
this breathtakingly nur delicious and
the performance is shocking it's really
not that far off having these components
on an open test bench and is basically
identical to having them in a full-size
chassis in fact for the card that would
normally be suffocating in the top PCIe
slot it's even better there is still
some more work to be done our Aussie
friends cannot hand wire and paint every
power supply for orthrus buyers and I
think if we were to do another project
with this case we'd probably reverse the
front bends to keep from recycling hot
air and maybe make use of the included
reservoir mount for a custom water loop
but we'll save that for another time for
now for all intents and purposes mission
accomplished
you could even say that now that's not a
gaming rig that's a gaming rig so a huge
shout out to Lucas and proto case for
allowing us to be the first to make a
video on this amazing case and also for
sending us another one when we lost the
first one you can follow this projects
future development at the link in the
video description or on Twitter at Luke
d underscore and see do you suffer from
the incredibly first world problem of
having far too many computers to keep
track of which keyboard and mouse goes
with which
well actually I'm being facetious
because that can be a real problem if
you have a development station and a
gaming station or a PC and a Mac well
synergy allows you to share one Mouse in
one keyboard between all of them
so you will no longer get confused and
it all happens amazingly seamlessly they
offer a basic and a pro option with a
one-time payment for lifetime access and
features include aside from just being
able to move the mouse across screens
like you wouldn't even believe clipboard
sharing dragging and dropping files the
ability to set up hotkeys and more use
our link in the video description to get
50% off of synergy today so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit the like button get subscribed
maybe consider checking out where to buy
this
well the internal components are
available for purchase where to buy the
stuff we've featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
