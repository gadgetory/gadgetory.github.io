different here on Linus tech tips we had
a unique opportunity to travel all the
way to Germany to test drive the all-new
BMW 1-series so I guess that's pretty
much all there is to say other than come
along for the ride this is the all-new
one series from BMW a line of sporty
economical hatchbacks that might
surprise you considering how much
performance and tech they've managed to
cram into a car of this class compared
to previous models the appearance of the
new lineup has been significantly
improved they've added an all new front
bumper design with bigger intakes
slimmer LED headlights and classic BMW L
shaped LED tail lights that weren't
present on previous one series vehicles
it's available in a variety of engine
sizes ranging from 109 horsepower three
cylinder all the way up to a 326
horsepower turbocharged inline six
rocketship with manual and automatic
gearboxes available powering either rear
wheel drive or BMWs all-wheel X Drive
now our car is equipped with an X Drive
120 diesel boasting the M Sport package
which features this sharp-looking S teal
blue color a sporty front clip 17-inch
rims and an exclusive side trim but of
course if I spent this whole video
blathering on about rims cornering
acceleration and braking you'd probably
think you clicked on the wrong channel
and besides I'm comparing this to my
heavily neglected 2003 Lambo anyway so
why don't I do us all a favor and leave
the car reviews to the car guys which ah
was that too soon and hop on over to
some of the top tech features of our
loaded up one series oh oh holy cow this
thing has a lot of buttons on it notice
you can set like eight different radio
stations I can do like six in mine I
don't think that's the technology we're
supposed to be focused on but first up
for me was the nav system now obviously
I'm in friggin Germany so I relied
pretty heavily on this bad
the preloaded Maps feature real-time
traffic on this like sick 3d view or a
more traditional view if you prefer that
and some other sweet add-ons including
different route mapping for best fuel
economy least amount of time or shortest
route real time speed limit updates
using a front-facing camera in the
windshield to tell you hey there's a
construction zone or hey there's adverse
weather conditions and this one is cool
background monitoring of topographical
information that allows adaptive
downshifting of the automatic
transmission when approaching an uphill
and it can also work with the cruise
control system to decrease speed when it
notices you're about to approach a
corner with all that said all the smart
navigation features in the world won't
completely stop you from being an idiot
behind the wheel sorry but we can laugh
about all of that and show off some more
features now because I clearly survived
now to be clear most of the features
were showing off are powered by BMWs
optional connected drive which uses a
built-in 3G or LTE SIM card that sits in
a crash protected enclosure in the rear
of the vehicle with the purchase of this
feature you get text messages SOS calls
and an unlimited data plan with no
roaming from one European country to
another and you can use that data plan
for other cool stuff as well like wiki
local a button you press to see cool
stuff to do nearby or getting real-time
stock updates in the dash of your car if
you're into that sort of thing to expand
BMW on lines functionality you can plug
in a compatible phone in the armrest
either with an adapter or a USB cable
run the BMW connection assistant this
stuff just like voice calls through your
car speakers does use your own phone so
your own mobile plan but also have some
interesting third-party apps internet
radio was one that let me feel a little
more at home even though I was on the
other side of the world and audible can
actually be integrated into your dash
and lets you listen to your favorite
audiobooks without fumbling around on
your phone while driving but if you're
not that into audiobooks how about this
one there's a GoPro app that's sick Nick
where's the GoPro we should totally set
it up I'm bringing up
all right okay so this is a totally
contrived opportunity for us to use the
concierge service now Luke actually
tried this back at CES two years ago and
said it was pretty impressive he
basically said they have to pretty much
do whatever you asked and they can't
hang up on you so Luke like kept the guy
on the phone forever we're not going to
do that but we're just going to place a
call and we're gonna get someone to tell
us where to buy a GoPro in music so
let's see how this goes welcome to BMW
ConnectedDrive speaker with Linus Larson
how may I help you wow your name is
Linus yeah that is the coolest thing
ever my name is Linus I don't meet many
more than a happy just another Lannister
that is fantastic don't worry I have an
actual reason for calling you um I mean
I'm in Munich right now which I guess
you probably know and I need to buy a
GoPro camera so I need like a general
electronics store and I was hoping that
you could help me find one and turn my
navigation system on to help me get
there okay look I would get they have
them at Media Markt are they open right
now that the here's one and it actually
seems to be open Oh awesome well it's
actually not that far from your current
position either it's well air distance
is 4.6 kilometers great sending it to a
car as we speak as a destination so just
let me know when it shows up uh yeah it
looks like that has shown up for me so I
guess I just press ok
yes the either ok or start guidance yeah
I'll go with start guidance since there
is no okay on the screen yeah
alright sir is there something else I
can help you with at the moment no I
think that's it thank you very much
Linus
same to you loan attorney or anything
else just call us back alright thank you
very much
his name's Linus
alright we got it so I guess now the
next step is to get this mounted on the
car and go find go find somewhere
interesting to drive I don't have my
keys how am I going to open this package
breaking all the things I say that isn't
this is something new for me but yeah oh
look at that it's open already okay hold
on
starting preview sweet it's upside down
while holding it upside down so nice so
let's go preview our position for it the
preview goes away when you go in to
drive but perforin
look at that bippity Boppity magic
Cinderella nonsense alright
back to actual driving technology the
adaptive cruise control or whatever BMW
calls it is one thing that blew my socks
off there's basically a radar box in the
front of the car that allows you to set
a speed up to 210 km/h then just forget
about it you'll automatically slow down
and even stop if the car in front of you
decelerate and then stay stop for less
than two seconds I want to put my foot
back down I don't need to apparently and
last but not least the all-new one
series parks it fell not just parallel
lis but even into a stall using an array
of sensors on the bumpers we've got the
mode on and we're just kind of cruising
along in the parking lot and of course
up hey I was going to say of course the
time you go to demo and it doesn't work
but it did reverse slowly and brake
manually uh-huh okay this is kind of
tripping me out right now
you can see ok the sensors are like yeah
I don't like that but yeah I mean you're
the one doing this
so uh-huh yeah drop drive forward slowly
ha ha ha uh-huh yeah
secure vehicle again strolling away you
got it buddy so I guess that's pretty
much it I want to thank the people of
Germany for being so hospitable and I
want to thank you guys as well for
watching the video today like it if you
liked it dislike it if you thought of
just plain sucked leave a comment if you
have suggestions for future videos
actually especially if you have
suggestions for future videos because
this whole car technology thing is
coming pretty close together these days
so it's probably not the last time
you're going to see this kind of thing
from us and as always guys don't forget
to follow and subscribe and all that
good stuff if you want to see more
videos from us because you don't want to
do those things if you don't want to see
more videos from us because that would
be pretty stupid thanks again for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
