to CES 2016 this year check out their
link in the description down below which
is squarespace.com slash Linus and use
offer code Linus for 10% off last CES in
the a su suite they looked on in horror
as I lifted the display cases up and put
my grubby paws all over their precious
demos this year well they've apparently
completely given up because in front of
me I have not one not two not three not
four I'm not even gonna try and pick up
the fifth one but five of the upcoming
zenfone zoom to show off to you guys
because they've realized they can't stop
me anyway so they might as well just let
me get my grubby paws on it this is
looking like a pretty impressive
follow-up to the zenfone 2 that I
reviewed earlier this year with the
specs being Wow about what you'd expect
so you've got a Z 3500 series Intel quad
core processor 4 gigs of this is
interesting dual channel ddr3 memory 64
gigs of storage microSD expansion you've
got their usual Zen UI you've got I
don't know I guess what else am I really
gonna say about it like it's pretty
responsive this is cool though odd the
bloatware apps I complained about on the
zenfone 2 they now have a tool yes my
friends you are gonna download an Asus
tool for once to just remove all of it
poof but the real killer for this one oh
yeah five and a half inch LCD display
1080p okay I'll get on with it the real
killer for this one is in the zoom name
yes my friends it has a 3x optical zoom
so it's funny because if I'm talking to
someone like my sister and I say okay
you can zoom on your phone she'll be
like oh yeah so you pinch and drag no no
optical zoom means with glass with
optics they've got a 10 element camera
lens construction doodad thing that
they've got blown up here next to me
that allows you not only to zoom in with
glass but it also has optical image
stabilization so you can see in these
test shots that I'm doing even at a
reasonable distance it's holding it
pretty darn still and I am getting
impressive detail I mean low light
performance was already a strength of
the zenfone line and it
like we're seeing nothing but
improvement here now the thing is that
it's not gonna come in you know cheapest
chips like a traditional zenfone might
you're not gonna be buying one for $1.99
in fact the 64 gig storage SKU is gonna
be 399
but that isn't unlocked non-carrier
restricted phone it does have swappable
backplate so you can customize the look
of it you know if you're into orange say
for example like Linus then you can do
that kind of thing and this is looking
pretty darn impressive definitely steps
in the right direction because isn't
that the a soos way do it then do it
pretty well then do it for real and I
think we're finally getting to that last
stage so thanks for checking out our
video on the zenfone zoom here at CES
2016 I want to take a moment to thank
our sponsor Squarespace for allowing us
to be here remember guys if you want to
build a beautiful website that looks
great whether it's on you know all the
