consumer grade Wi-Fi is pou we all know
it but what could we really expect it's
like that whole how great do you expect
the camera on your phone to be
conversation all over again a wireless
router is not a real thing it's a
colloquial term when you what you call a
wireless routers actually three pieces
of hardware that are rolled into one a
router a network switch and a wireless
access point then a team of highly
trained monkeys develops the firmware
software and UI which is difficult
enough when you're just trying to make
all that stuff for one piece of hardware
then they have to turn around and sell
all of this for whatever
consumer-friendly price point they are
targeting let's say 49.99 no wonder it's
all poop so I reached out to Wendell
from tech syndicate for help Wendell I
said save me from the poo
I'm not a plumber he replied to which I
said I know it's Wireless poo and
Wendell descended from the heavens with
a recommendation for me to try the
ubiquity unify AC access point that you
see right here in it's pleasing Brown
box so let's take a look at the hardware
it's not a pleasing ID that can be
easily wall or ceiling mounted it's nice
and low-profile and comes with all the
hardware you need little plastic
mounting plate right here metal bracket
as well as the screws and nuts that
you're going to need for that it's got a
center led ring in the middle that glows
either white or blue and can be used for
diagnostic so you can see whether or not
it's connected to the network as well as
as a device locator so it'll flash blue
if you tell it to through the software
so you can actually find where it is
identify which one is which if you're
deploying a bunch of them it's got
internal antennas so that helps with the
pleasing look and also just as one fewer
thing to set up but don't worry the
range is still quite strong and then
when we flip it over to the bottom we
find two Ethernet ports ah there's
nothing sort of too complicated here
guys it doesn't support teaming or
anything like that but there's just a
main
and a secondary and that's for failover
in case one of them outright dies the
cool thing about the Ethernet ports we
don't really discover until we dig
further into the box and find this guy
right here this is a POV injector or
power over ethernet what this allows you
to do is place this pretty much anywhere
you can get an Ethernet cable you don't
have to worry about AC power because
both power and data are going to be
carried by the rj45 cable so all you do
is plug this guy into a wall Ethernet
from here out to your switch or router
and then from here off to your access
point and the whole thing is taken care
of very very cool in terms of the actual
specs for Wi-Fi it supports up to 1,300
megabit per second wireless AC with MIMO
and a range of up to 400 feet although
obviously both of those things won't be
happening at the same time so one of the
main advantages of this product well
number one is the consumer friendly
management software and maybe that's
actually why a wendel recommended it to
me in particular anyway more on the more
on the management software later the
next one is seamless roaming between
access points with their zero handoff
feature this is something that ubiquity
talks about a lot and it's great for
applications like VoIP that are
sensitive to network interruptions that
way if you have multiple ones of these
deployed like you often would in an
enterprise environment you can move
between them and not have whatever it is
you're doing interrupted although more
on 0 handoff in just a moment with
respect to this one it also offers
endless expandability so that whole
thing about having lots of them and just
plain higher performance it's
enterprise-grade this is something I
observed personally I am very very happy
with this product even though it costs
$300 so let's move on to the software it
allows you to easily see the status of
any given access point including radio
configuration bandwidth monitoring the
clients that are connected to it and
much more if the software for management
works across huge installations even
multi-site like multi campuses and runs
on just a Windows or Mac PC that is
connected to the same network they say
on their site that it runs on Linux as
well but I didn't see a download for it
so your mileage may vary there you can
even do things like upload little maps
into the software so when you're
managing locations you can be like ok
well I put one here and you can
get around and you can map out your
network that way it supports automatic
firmware upgrade so it just will
automatically upgrade the firmware of
your access points and it even supports
cool stuff like a guest portal or
hotspot that includes support for
charging for it as well which is kind of
neat
now this whole thing may have sounded
like a paid product placement or
commercial but it's actually quite the
opposite I bought two of these I paid
for them because I am just so sick of
dealing with consumer grade Wireless
solutions even my RTN 66u which is the
best I've used so far for range and
signal consistency isn't as good as this
and it's just not good enough I mean my
house isn't that big it's 2,300 square
feet which isn't huge and a single
router just doesn't cut it this much
better and it's funny because it was
when I first installed it I wasn't that
impressed it's actually difficult to
quantify the performance difference with
simple tools like Wi-Fi analyzer for
Android or just like looking at the
reception bars and I don't actually have
any strong AC clients that I could use
to really test out the max throughput
but what I can say is that when it comes
to real-world running around my house
streaming video or using Nvidia game
stream or browsing the Internet this AC
access point comes out on top it's
simple to use it's seamless to deploy
it's easy to manage and it just plain
works mostly the one thing that
disappointed me is that zero handoff
feature that's all over their site it's
not implemented on the AC version I was
I was quite disappointed because while
seamless which this one does support is
enough for a buffered video playback
like YouTube or for web browsing to be
completely uninterrupted like you'd
never even notice that you're moving
from one to another it is not enough to
stream a game on shield as you move
between access points and I did pick up
two of these hoping that I would be able
to have perfect reception all over my
house and be completely uninterrupted no
it drops when you cross a threshold and
you will have to manually reconnect but
once you do it is back up and running
they do say the firmware upgrade is
coming at some point though even with
that complaint thumbs up for this
product it's expensive but my ex
is that I should only be upgrading my
Wi-Fi hardware when I legitimately need
a speed increase again rather than when
I get tired of the BS from my current
setup which is what happened to me many
times in the past I mean think about
this okay this is $300 but how many
routers that cost a hundred bucks or a
hundred and fifty bucks have you been
through in the last year or two is it
time for a new approach what do you
think leave your comments let me know if
this has changed the way you think about
networking technology especially
Wireless because it's just mostly
terrible you can leave those comments
under the video or you can check out the
Linus tech tips firm we'll have a link
in the video description remember guys
as always liked this video if you liked
it dislike it if you thought it was pooj
