a wave of affordability to the entire
video production industry from amateur
video creators to indie filmmakers and
even production professionals worldwide
and one of the biggest disruptions in
the camera space was the 2013 release of
the original Blackmagic pocket Cinema
Camera a camera that I personally bought
and used for years so six years later
can the pocket 4k be as disruptive as
its predecessor was let's find out right
after a word from our sponsor honey
honey is a free web extension that will
let you get the best promo codes on most
shopping websites like Amazon eBay and
more get it today at join honeycomb
slash LTT before we begin a quick
physical tourist in order here because
unlike the original the pocket 4k well
isn't really pocket bull at all and it
also makes a departure from black magics
customary above average build quality
the body is made out of space-age carbon
fiber polycarbonate composite which
appears to be black magics way of saying
unapologetically plastic the top of the
camera has the standard layout of
buttons for record ISO shutter speed
white balance stills capture and three
custom function buttons on the back of
the camera you get a 5-inch 1080p
display more on that in a moment and
some very useful buttons for iris and
focus along with a dedicated high frame
rate button this makes switching
framerate so much more convenient than
the multiple menus you'd have to go
through on something like a sony camera
we've also got a shortcut for zoom in
for focus menu and playback and then on
the far right I'm very pleased to see
dual media slots there is one slot for
CFS 2.0 cards and another for SD cards I
hope you're taking notes red and the
pocket 4k is impressive recording
options do not stop there you can also
use small portable SSDs that plug
directly into the type C port on the
left of the camera for our testing our
friends over in Joburg sent us this
awesome match kit that they specifically
created for the pocket 4k it comes with
a 256 e @ c FS 2.0 card and a 512
getting portable SSD and both served me
very well on extended shoot days that I
tested this camera on being able to
record directly to an SSD and then just
plug that same SSD into my laptop to
start editing was a very satisfying
workflow that I got
- over the last couple months I've been
testing this camera it just makes sense
finishing off the physical tour on the
left of the camera we have a mic in
headphone jack full size HDMI which
you'd agree is important if you've seen
how many micro HDMI s have worn out like
we have a 12-volt lemo connector type C
and mini XLR we're off to a very good
start here and it gets way better let's
talk about the sensor the pocket 4k
sports a micro 4/3 sized sensor capable
of shooting up to 60fps at 4096 by 2160
with 13 stops of dynamic range and an
interesting dual native ISO of 432
hundred that's very impressive at this
price point but as many of you already
know modern camera formants is as much
about software as it is about hardware
fortunately Blackmagic has done a
stellar job here as well and the images
that come off the pocket 4k are
outstanding I was able to put the camera
through my usual variety of shooting
scenarios and I was reminded of the
difference a camera that is designed
with filmmaking in mind can have
compared to something made for stills
and video from the likes of Sony cannon
or Panasonic noise performance was
surprisingly good at higher ISOs like
1600 and 3200 both read fairly clean in
my tests which is not common for a
camera with a sensor this size for
documentary shooters I see this being a
huge positive when you're dealing with
lighting conditions that are constantly
changing with no time to pause to adjust
for lighting the pocket 4k also boasts
60fps at 4k and 120 FPS at windowed
1080p recording modes and while it is a
loss in quality the 120 fps is totally
usable and compared to the competition
shooting internally at this frame rate
the results are simply put excellent
black magics menu is incredibly easy to
navigate and while they feel a little
mushy all the buttons are useful and
efficient to use the main pain point
with the image that I came across is the
highlight we're all off in the pocket 4k
still has a hard digital looking clip if
you are unable to perfectly expose for
the brightest parts of your image I was
particularly impressed with black magics
newbie raw recording format well it's
not officially supported by Adobe there
is a workaround to play B raw footage
natively in Premiere and I was shocked
at how easily the footage plays back in
real time even on my LG work laptop that
does not have much in terms of
horsepower Blackmagic Raw like the red
rod that we use every day gives the user
the ability
change ISO and white balance after the
fact through metadata which is a huge
plus when you're running and gunning and
don't have time to get your settings
perfect now let's get into usability I
mentioned it doesn't fit in a pocket but
it's a little worse than that overall
the pocket for kit is a bit awkward in
its size for example because of its
width
you might end up needing weird offset
plates to balance it on a popular small
gimbal like the Ronin s I did however
manage to come up with a build that I
quite liked made up of parts that we had
around the office now you might look at
this and wonder if we're fully taking
advantage of the pocket for case small
size but truthfully we didn't feel like
we had much of a choice a lot of the
bulk of this setup comes from needing to
use a dummy battery plate which allows
us to use larger female batteries that
we use for our Reds because the pocket
for Kay's battery life is a disgrace to
cameras everywhere we honestly weren't
even expecting that much given its
predecessors bad battery life but with
the standard LP e6 batteries I was
getting less than 20 minutes of runtime
on this camera that is not usable
thankfully you have a lot of options to
power it I decided to use an inexpensive
LP e6 dummy battery to DTaP adaptor
which allowed me to run the pocket for
hours longer off a single V mAh battery
this does make the setup larger but that
is also a welcome thing for my use case
because a heavy camera is a steadier
camera just to try out we did spend a
little time shooting handheld with the
pocket 4k by itself this can be handy if
you're trying to capture some high
quality footage discreetly I totally
understand the appeal by the way but it
wasn't an ideal experience ergonomically
the body with just a lens is just too
lightweight to make for the best
handheld work because of the points of
contact this is a personal preference
however so your mileage may vary now
let's get back to that 5 inch display
the touch screen is quite responsive and
reacts similar to the red touch monitor
that we use on our daily driver weapon
but a key disadvantage is that it's
fixed in one position while not being
bright enough to use in daylight making
an external monitor an essential part of
any pocket 4k build audio was an
interesting experience to me on this
camera because it has a mini XLR port
you can get an adaptor cable like this
one to use full size XLR systems like
our electro sonic wireless lab pack or
sennheiser 416 shotgun mic from my
testing it not only worked but it
sounded surprisingly usable that was a
really pleasant surprise given black
magics historically poor in-camera
recording quality
over
although I still recommend getting a
separate sound operator or recording
device for sound critical projects but
if you're trying to save money on gear
or need to travel light for a project
this is a good option this brings me to
my final point simply put the pocket 4k
is unprecedented in terms of its quality
for the price point no other camera on
the market does what it can do for less
money and the best part is unlike
Blackmagic previous disruptors they are
fewer obvious deal breakers that might
for small crews to move up to something
more expensive that being said the true
cost of ownership will obviously be much
higher than the $1,300 price tag but
anyone just starting their career like I
was when I bought my original pocket
camera it's an incredible tool to learn
from and improve your video and
filmmaking skills so bottom line for
anyone looking to get into video on a
budget you have no excuses to not go out
and shoot something great when a camera
like this exists on the market Bravo
