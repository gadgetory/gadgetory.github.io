XCOM hey guys we're here at gam dias and
I know what you're probably thinking is
slick another keyboard video seriously
no no guys okay first we're gonna do the
mouse then we'll do the keyboard of
course I had to get to that then we do
the headset that we're gonna do this
interesting thing right here so first
I'm gonna go over the mouse like I just
said at first it looks nuts there's tons
of stuff all over the place
there's 11 macro keys do to do to do to
do all over the place it's all
programmable they have a nice software
for all of their things tied into one
let's actually jump up to that real
quick so this is their software right
now I just have the mouse and keyboard
plugged in so at the bottom you can see
mouse and keyboard are available so one
piece of software all your peripherals
as long as they're all from Gambia's
alright we're going to jump back down
not spend too much time with software as
it's still mostly in beta if I flip the
mouse over you'll find three scroll
wheel II type things right here as you
can see they're connected directly if I
can spin this out to the plastic panel
that is closest to them so this one
controls this panel this one controls
this panel and this one controls this
panel making it a very adjustable Mouse
apparently there's also going to be
options for other plates to go on this
as well and on this side they've noted
that some people with smaller hands had
problems getting their pinkies caught in
here so on the actual production model
that will be released they're going to
have a plug that can go there
temporarily and they can remove it later
on if they don't want it personally I
would leave it out because I think it
looks great without it and my pinky's
not going to be caught there I currently
have the most setup in the configuration
for my hand so I usually claw grip mice
and this post isn't big enough for me to
palm grip anyways but I never palm grip
anything so it's not really that big of
a deal so it fits me perfectly right now
which is actually kind of nice every
finger goes into its exact spot that I
would want it to go to my pinky doesn't
drag along the mat my thumb doesn't drag
along the mat everything is working fine
it's a fine looking Mouse we're gonna
move on to the keyboard now again slick
another keyboard review this one does
actually have some interesting things
first off I noticed this little camera
button and that intrigues me it's a
recording button or a streaming button
or a network streaming button or
whatever you want it on release it's not
ready yet but I have been told
what you can do is you can live stream
with it or you can local record with it
or you can stream to another computer in
the house so if you have someone with a
home theater computer set up to the TV
you get streamed to that your dad or
your family or your mom or whoever wants
to watch you play whatever game you're
playing can watch their I don't know if
you have anyone that wants to just sit
and watch you play games but that is a
cool option now moving forward if I pull
this key off they'll probably not be too
happy that I didn't use a key polar but
I don't know whatever so sorry gam Deus
it looks like cherry blue switches it
looks fairly standard but then there's
this little square around the switch
that is a way of dampening the press so
it doesn't actually bottom out which
makes it quite a bit quieter as if I'm
gonna put the mic there I don't know how
it tuned you are with Cherry blues but
they're really really loud you can hear
the click and then you can hear it slam
against the bottom of the keyboard if
you press all the way down like I do I
always press all the way down it's a bad
habit but it is a habit so that dampens
it and also makes less total travel time
and makes it spring up faster they're
clean claiming that is a type of hybrid
switch and it'll feel more like a red
than it does like a blue I'm not so sure
how I feel about that I like the blues
and I like dampeners but I'm not sure
how much a red user would be able to
actually relate the two that's up to you
I would recommend trying it out yourself
as I do with all mechanical keyboards up
at the top here that have got a USB hub
one of them with mic and audio headers
not headers plugs sorry about that
talks a lot today jumping down to the
bottom they have a wrist rest it's a
massive wrist rest any 7g users will
like they're huge risk wrestle like this
one thing to notice is its magnetic
clips in very nicely and if you take it
off spin it around and put it on top of
your keyboard it actually works as a
dust cover this is kind of interesting I
do carry dust covers with my keyboards
just to keep them nice and pristine and
if you weren't a place that is very
dusty this could help you out it's just
interesting added functionality that
Gambia's has done you'll notice that
their logo actually says Zeus on it that
is just actually their logo they are
Gambia's as it says on the wrist rest
moving past the keyboard we get to
pestis this thing is huge and crazy and
has heat sinks and vibrates and moment
motors
and everything so basically I'm gonna
jump into the heatsinks they're saying
gamers ears get hot
that sounds pretty accurate to me so
they have heat sinks in here to try and
keep the overall temperature of the of
the cans cold so our freezin terminology
cans there that's what some people call
ear cups on headphones huge huge soft
cups they feel quite nice up here
there's a little bit not quite as much
as down here but this is the more
important part in my opinion if say
you're in a game someone throws a
grenade and it blows up behind you
depending on what side they're on one of
the earmuffs will vibrate and I believe
if it's central they'll both vibrate
yeah so if it's central they were both
vibrate if it's on one side one will
vibrate just a little bit of added
functionality there they like tolling it
if added forth develoment
so that's kind of interesting or forced
to mention the boom mic is very
adjustable so if you somehow have a
mouth that's over here when the rest of
your face is over there
you can do that or you can very easily
have it wherever you want it it seems to
be able to be pretty stiff wherever you
want it so that is pretty cool these
things I tested them out the base is
pretty insane it can pound like pretty
much no other of course there is others
but pretty much no other base is awesome
I noticed a little bit of siblings on
some highs but those weren't that bad
and that brings us to this guy this
guy's quite interesting it it heats to
your monitor through 3m stickers and
it's actually not that bad apparently if
you take it off it doesn't leave and it
won't pull any of the paint off your
monitor although it may leave some
residue basically what this is is its
cable management for one cable I highly
suggest your mouse as they have it set
up here and then on the back if I can
rotate this monitor I'm getting some
people trying to help me here we'll try
and get this done I'm gonna unplug the
monitor actually there we go there we go
there you go USB 2.0 hub on the back
that is actually pretty cool and then
this you've probably won wondering what
that was doing there I had the
headphones hooked up there and that's
actually what makes sense a lot of
people don't have headphone holders
personally I have Sennheiser's that came
with a headphone holder and I love it if
you don't have a headphone holder this
is not a bad idea
