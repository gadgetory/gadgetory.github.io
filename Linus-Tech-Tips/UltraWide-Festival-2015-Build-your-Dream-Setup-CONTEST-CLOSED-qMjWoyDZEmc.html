probably doesn't mean anything to you
but that's okay because it's new but you
should care about it because LG has
pulled out all the stops to make this
thing absolutely banaynays like
seriously pay careful attention here
because they are giving away 30 34 inch
ultra wide monitors very similar to the
one I reviewed very positively here and
three grand prize packages for the lucky
winners to build their dream setup
alright so here's how to apply create a
video 30 seconds max before September
25th about your current set-up we've
done video contests before and I'll link
some of the winners and honorable
mentions below to give you some idea of
what we want to see but if there's one
pro tip I can give you now it is this
creativity is key you will not win with
a handheld shot of your tower and an
overlaid list of specs how the goofy
friend come over make something fun and
entertaining it will be worth it when
you're done share it with me by tagging
me at Linus tech on Twitter or posting
it in the official Linus tech tips comm
forum thread linked below then go to wwl
tree wide festival comm and submit a
link to your post I get to choose ten of
those entries to take home an LG 34 UC
87 C yes a curved 34 inch ultra wide IPS
display once that's done each of those
people will create a video about their
experience with the ultra wide this can
be in the form of a review or something
more creative I'm not actually sure yet
I'll communicate that with the 10
finalists directly when the time comes
once those submissions are received I'll
choose one grand prize winner I will
work directly with that person to design
his or her dream setup with a budget of
ten thousand US dollars in hardware and
software then I'll be sharing it on my
social media channels and finally I'll
be inviting that person to come and
attend a meet-up an award ceremony event
hosted by LG here in Vancouver hold on a
second Linus you said there were 30
monitors and three grand prize packs
yes I did I'm responsible for us
of them you can enter to win the others
over at unbox therapy and Jehovah
Witness so go check out their contest
announcement videos for the full details
now keep in mind that you can only be a
finalist through one of us but nothing
prevents you from submitting separate
entries for each of us so for full
contest details visit</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
