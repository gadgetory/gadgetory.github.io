your phone find out about this and more
at eleven coolermaster v-series semi
modular power supplies feature 80 plus
gold efficiency and their gold guarantee
five-year warranty click now to learn
more so most people don't know that they
have people on their phones including me
until recently I knew that fecal matter
flying out of your toilet when you
flushed it was kind of an issue but I
didn't quite realize how bad it actually
was luckily someone at the Wellcome
Trust did know about this the Wellcome
Trust aim is to and I quote achieve
extraordinary improvements in health by
supporting the brightest minds and
essentially they're an independent
charity that funds research to improve
human and animal health they
accomplished this by being one of the
world's largest providers of non
governmental funding and they funded a
study that found that one in six phones
are contaminated by fecal matter which
wouldn't be a problem if you could wash
your phone the same way you wash dishes
enter the phone soap charger a proper
cleaning solution for your phone phone
so claims and I quote that there is a
lot of ways to sanitize your phones such
as with soap bleach or fire the first
two will very possibly damage your phone
and however awesome cleansing your phone
with fire may sound don't do it although
that being said having a fire cleansing
blowtorch for your phone would be pretty
metal
ah back to reality so how does it work
well the phone soap utilizes ultraviolet
German radiation which is already used
in a variety of applications including
food air and water purification the
specific ultraviolet light required is
called UVC which is short wavelength
ultraviolet radiation and the phone soap
uses two UVC lamps which are positioned
above and below the phone while it is
inside the phone soap charge all of this
sounds great because after all the
research I've been doing I'd rather not
have this acne causing disease spreading
crap pun intended on my phone because
that thing goes against my face man some
amount of germs can be good for your
immune system but the amount that is on
your phone could be a little bit too
much now that we know how it works let's
do a quick tour of the unit in terms of
build quality well it's a plastic
box it's totally unacceptable but it
also isn't horrible I would have liked
to see more considering you're paying
$60 for what is essentially two UV lamps
a USB plug and some plastic housing
around it but if it performs its
function then I guess that's all right
speaking of USB plug you can plug in any
USB cable you want into the unit so be
able to charge pretty much whatever
phone you have which is nice and there's
an LED on the front of the unit which
shows its status blue means the unit is
currently in cleaning mode and green
means your phone is fully charged and
last but not least there are unique
acoustic outlets aka holes which are cut
into the bottom of the unit which will
allow sound pass-through so you won't
miss any alarms or notifications that
may go off and with that out of the way
the question on everyone's mind is does
it actually work well phone soap and the
Daily Planet both seem to think so they
went to a microbiology lab and made this
video I'm no scientist but there was
else seemed a little bit too amazing and
although this is my personal
non-professional opinion I wasn't a fan
of a few things about their methodology
one they sprayed pre-made bacteria on
the phone and immediately went to
cleansing it with a phone soap or in the
case of the control immediately pressing
against an agar plate this process
doesn't seem as real world as we would
like with our testing - they only left
the phone in the phone soap for the four
minute cycle that it takes to clean the
phone not the common way I would expect
people to use it which is an overnight
cycle three they claim you see results
of the control test that would had
bacteria that was living on the phone
but it was just sprayed on the phone
with a solution that was pre created all
in all it felt like the control test was
just a result of exactly what was in the
spray bottle they may have all just
sprayed the spray bottle directly onto
the agar and again I'm not a scientist
but letting different bacteria live on
the phone for prolonged period of time
so it has time to cultivate and grow
like it would in the real world
especially in pockets and purses which
act almost like incubators would make
for a more realistic test than just a
spray bottle their test didn't have much
to do with the phone they could have
actually sprayed the solution on any non
biocidal object and the results honestly
would have been the same so let's walk
through the methodologies we used we
actually decided to do it a second time
because
we were worried when our initial results
conflicted with the Daily Planet the
first test was with two separate HTC One
m8 which I cleaned off with an alcohol
solution then I use both of them the
exact same way doing the exact same
thing for two days I then put one phone
in the phone soap and left it on the
table and left the other one on the
table beside it for a total of eight
hours after which I let the cultures
grow in a Garver the results were
inconclusive with all the plates looking
more or less the same and we were
concerned that using two different
phones and letting the plates cultivate
for too long may have both affected our
results the second test was done with
one phone an iPhone 4 I ran this through
a worst case scenario by intentionally
not taking care of it the way I normally
do as I'm actually quite anal about the
cleanliness of my phone pun intended
I prepared agar plates and then swab the
phone before putting it in phone sub
charger as I first put four plates in
our warm server room to cultivate after
eight hours I swabbed the now phone
soaked phone and did the same thing
about four days later it takes longer
because we don't have an incubator I
first took the control samples out and
filmed an examination of them and then
eight hours later I took the phone so
samples out and filmed an examination of
them as well doing the exact same
procedure to be clear once again were
not scientists and we totally love to
hear your feedback on our methodology
and we're not specifically calling out
the Daily Planet we just thought this
thing was pretty cool so we bought it
for an unboxing ages ago but since we
don't do on boxing's anymore we end up
having to actually review it I don't
actually think there's anything
inherently wrong with daily planets
testing methodology and it is likely
more technically correct than ours it's
I just prefer more real-world testing
scenario when testing something that I
will actually use in the real world this
is the same reason why we do gaming
benchmarks by actually playing the game
instead of using a canned benchmark in
the end the results were not as good as
I was hoping
after watching the other video but it
did have a repeatable measurable
positive effect in one case it actually
left the plate very if not perfectly
clean but it did leave things behind in
our three other scenarios another thing
to note is that we are not in a lab so
the control group isn't perfect meaning
that all the agar
didn't have the exact same bacteria or
the exact same amount of bacteria in
them but that doesn't change the fact
that the phone soap still didn't cleanse
whatever that bacteria was off the phone
and this bacteria is what came out of
the foam soap so as far as I can tell if
you want something that can mostly clean
your phone than the phone soap is it but
it may not be the 100% effective
solution that the Daily Planet showed in
their video and it also won't help the
fact that your pocket is essentially an
incubator and you're growing cultures
throughout the day while you use your
phone let me know what you guys think in
the comments below and on the forum
don't forget to like this video dislike
this video subscribe and share this
video to everyone because it's super
interesting also if you want to buy a
shirt check out the link in the
description below we've got a few
interesting things I think there might
be no Highlander shirts sold out by now
so you missed it but if you want to
catch all the rest of our shirts on sale
be sure to check that link out and if
you don't like advertisements I know a
ton of you don't become a form
contributor because it gets rid of all
of them on the forum thanks for watching
