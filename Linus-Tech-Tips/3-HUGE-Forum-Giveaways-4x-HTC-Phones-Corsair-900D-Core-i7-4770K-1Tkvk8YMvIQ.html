of purposes number one is I'm going to
tell you about some really cool
giveaways we have going on the linus
tech tips forum and number two is it's
going to serve as a bit of a video tour
of the new home of linus media group for
sort of it's kind of a long story but
here we are we're taking over this house
so here's all the gear well most of the
gear yeah this wide open space here is
going to be put to some kind of a use so
if you guys aren't registered on Linus
tech tips com already you should
probably do that we've hit some major
milestones over the last little while we
have twenty thousand registered users
now we're getting over a hundred
thousand pageviews per day on a
consistent basis now which is just
unbelievable in terms of the numbers
that we're achieving in such a short
period of time we're going to head
downstairs next and we are getting
overwhelmingly positive feedback from
members who are saying linus tech tips
com changed my life actually nobody said
that but we have had people saying linus
tech tips com is awesome the community
is so helpful and it's just great and
awesome in every possible way so we
thought what better time than now to
give something back to the community
that is making itself so awesome so we
have worked out a number of Giveaways
that are actually all running right now
number one is the for HTC phone giveaway
so what you're going to do is check out
the link in the video description below
HTC is giving away for phones this is a
worldwide contest unfortunately they're
not HTC one's but depending on your
region you can get phones like the One X
plus you can get a windows phone 8x
which is pretty darn cool and so yeah
depending on the region you can get
different phones so you want to spread
the word about this contest for more
chances to win it's working much the
same way as the one that we did for
Intel around their PAX East presence
next up speaking of Intel they're
sponsoring us to give away a 4770k this
is a pretty cool prize but this one's
very short term
sighs it's all about Intel's land fest
so that's going on in Dupont Washington
on the second you gotta retweet a
particular tweet which is linked in the
description under the video in order to
qualify to win the 4770k which as you
guys probably know isn't even released
yet so you'll be one of the first people
in the world to get a Haswell
fourth-generation core series processor
and the fastest one available at that so
that's that's a pretty cool prize as
well now the last one is very special to
me because it's from someone who has
actually been a contributor to Linus
tech tips in a number of different ways
and very very cool guy fellow hello
Video Creator just like myself and it's
Timmy tech TV so he has decided to
contribute a 900d he's doing a 900d
giveaway oh yeah the Intel one is
international he has contributed a 900d
to his subscriber base meaning you've
got a pretty good chance to win right
now because honestly his channel isn't
as big as it probably should be and he
has a pretty unique requirement for that
900d you have to well one you have to be
in North America because shipping is
incredibly expensive and it's coming out
of his own pocket and number two is you
have to be a member of the linus tech
tips form in order to win so the contest
closes on the thirtieth of june which
means you have from now until the 30th
of june to subscribe to timmy tech TV on
youtube i'll link his channel in the
video description as well as register on
the linus tech tips forum for our chance
to win see we ended our tour right in
the right place yeah my lav mic broke in
case you guys are wondering why I'm
holding it around like this like a
freakin idiot it's not working right now
so there you go I'm riding the 900 d and
you guys can ride all the chances to win
that you could possibly want remember
guys without you this community at Linus
tech tips com is just a lifeless
soulless string of characters in a
browser bar and
yeah we really appreciate what you guys
are doing and you know what even for
members themselves are contributing in
order to make this community grow so
that's pretty much it as always don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
