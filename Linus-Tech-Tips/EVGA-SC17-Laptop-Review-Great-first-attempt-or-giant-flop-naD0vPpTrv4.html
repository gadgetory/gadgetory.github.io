complex as a laptop from a new player
and draw either of these conclusions one
that they've simply rebadged someone
else's probably mediocre be level design
unless they paid huge money for an
exclusive or two that they did a
horrible job on it due to their
inexperience EVGA has the potential
though to be different while they have
done and continue to pretty much apply
colorful boxes and stickers to third
party designs like oh I don't know this
one
they also have a deeply experienced
motherboard electrical and software
design team giving them way more
applicable engineering street cred than
someone like Razer who's surprised
I think everyone over the last four
years by bursting onto the scene and
demonstrating that there is still room
for a newcomer to shake things up in
this category but is EVGA walking down
that same path to success or is it all
just theoretically I guess it makes more
sense than it at first glance appeared
to there's only one way to find out
intel skull canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 quad-core processor
and Thunderbolt 3 learn more at the link
in the video description
opening up the SC 17 we get pretty much
the entire guts laid out before us with
none of the configurable or upgradable
components trickily hiding under the
keyboard or anything like that my config
has a 256 gig sm 951 nvme SSD
accompanied by a one terabyte hard drive
notably a nine millimeter thick one
haven't seen one of those in a while
it's got an Intel 82 sixty and GW
wireless card and a seventy four and a
half watt hour battery which is
well-positioned for reducing sweaty palm
syndrome directly under the touchpad
which is fortunate because the top of
the laptop does get quite toasty up
towards the screen moving on to the rest
unlike this sager unit that we reviewed
a while back that featured a desktop gtx
980 video card a desktop core i7 6700 K
four sodium's lots for memory expansion
and all the cooling to go with it EVGA
has gone for a purely mobile device
based design around a 45 watt core i7
6820 HK BGA cpu so that means it's
soldered directly to the motherboard
with a mere two sodium slots though
thanks to ddr4 Zim proved density
they've packed 32 gigs of 26 66
megahertz ran into them and even gone as
far as to bake the gtx 980m Mobile GPU
directly onto the main board rather than
opting for an annex an add-in card this
seems to have directly contributed to
the SC 17s slimmer than most 17-inch
gaming notebooks design the size of
which should be pretty easy to gauge
looking at the relative size of the two
a type USB 3 and single C type USB 3.1
and headphone jacks on the right as well
as the until Gigabit LAN HDMI 1.4 normal
mini DisplayPort and gsync ready mini
DisplayPort on the Left alright then
while it is slimmer
and then many other 17 inch class gaming
behemoths it's still bigger and very
dense feeling compared to an A or a sex
7 why well first and foremost because
EVGA has chosen tank-like construction
over portability and while they seemed
to have brute forced it a little I mean
that bottom cover has to be the thickest
that I have ever seen
they definitely achieved their goal the
machined aluminum chassis has less flex
with its bottom cover removed than most
laptops this size that I've encountered
that are fully assembled and I have
never seen a 17 inch laptop with a
screen with this little flex like holy
actual and this approach carries over to
cooling as well with four heat pipes
carrying heat away from the CPU and GPU
toward a total of four heatsink Finn
arrays that are fed by a pair of large
blower style fans they intake air from
the bottom of the unit right next to
this beefy rubber heel that pulls double
duty adding a subtle angle to the
keyboard and cleverly ensuring that
there's enough clearance on the bottom
of the device for ample airflow and it
works pretty well I would like for EVGA
to tune their fan ramping logic which
can make these sharp adjustments as
often as every 5 to 10 seconds while
gaming but at 70 degrees under low
tonight at 64 on the CPU and about the
same on the GPU while running unige in
heaven even while overclocked by 76
megahertz
I can't really complain though it should
be noted that the CPU got quite a bit
hotter at about 90 degrees Celsius with
the canned 3.8 gigahertz all core
overclocked and while this use 3 screws
in place of every nail approach in spite
of EVGA s efforts to engineer a flatter
power brick that slides into your bag
more easily does not improve the thoth
ability of the SC 17 what it does do is
sidestep the trap that many newcomers
and even many multinationals fall into
where they either to save weight or
material cost managed to build devices
out of aluminum and corning glass and
still have them feel kind
cheap so I think there's a lot of merit
to this approach especially for a
17-inch gaming device where
realistically were you going to be
carting it around to class every day
anyway not for the keyboard
unfortunately while I think they did a
good job of the touchpad it's got a
slightly heavy click but zero noticeable
latency and flawless 200 operation are
the highlights here the keyboard tuning
needs some work iMHO the 5 level
backlight is good the layout is fine
other than using prime hotkey space on
the up and down arrows for switching
over clocks instead of page up and down
and it's not like there's keycap wobble
or anything like that but the top of
each stroke is stiff while the bottoming
out is spongy and the spacebar in
particular is so mushy that I actually
found myself misfiring fairly frequently
let's talk screen now EVGA puzzlingly
equips the SC 17 with a 4k 60 hertz IPS
panel from sharp that manages great
color fantastic contrast with a non
distracting amount of motion blur
actually very little backlight bleed as
well sounds great Linus why is that
puzzling because the 980m
even with EVGA shockingly smooth
pre-configured overclock for the CPU and
GPU in their precision X software and
this is mind-bending they're full fat
enthusiasts grade BIOS level
overclocking features with like mouse
support clear CMOS button and all that
you know just like a desktop just is not
really capable of driving triple-a
titles at 4k with high details not today
and definitely not 2 to 3 years from now
and since there are no g-sync 4k panels
that I'm aware of their decision left
them with no support for what is in my
opinion the only technology that Nvidia
provides aside from just putting a
faster GPU in there a desktop grade one
that could compensate for a GPU
resolution mismatch like this with
smoother animations at lower and highly
variable frame rates they did say that
they're working on it at CES but that
doesn't help buyers today which I guess
leads us very gracefully into today
his conclusion and the answer to the
question that I posed about six minutes
ago it depends on how you evaluate
success if I were to pick on what was
bad I could say that at the price I
don't think they're spec competes well
with the fatter heavier and uglier but
significantly faster gaming laptops that
are out there from competitors but if I
were to look at what they got right
there is a lot to like here
they built a chassis and a unique
product identity around quality and
overclocked ability that I believe they
can carry forward for a couple of years
at least without anyone properly
competing with it the machine was
rock-solid in my testing with zero odd
behavior and they even avoided most of
the oopsies that first time laptop
makers fall into the 1080p webcams soft
image quality and poor low-light
performance are a bit of a drag but the
speakers and the built-in microphone are
both surprisingly good I'm just here for
the food all right please which means
that while I won't be running out to
drop nearly three G's after taxes and
shipping on an SE 17 I will have a very
close eye on future evj mobile products
well done guys mass drop is working with
HiFi man to bring back their 8300
headphones with a special MD or mass
drop Edition so in their former life
under solely the hi-fi man name these
entry-level headphones were a whopping
$300 the new one is actually very
similar to the older HP 300s but with an
updated and more lightweight structure a
more neutral sound signature and an
all-black appearance compared to the
silver and black of older generations
the most important thing though the
biggest change is the price they've
reduced it to a very low 99 US dollars
so you can check that out at draw dot
slash ltte - HM - 350 or you can just
click the link in the video description
and if you're a little confused because
you've never
of mass drop before well I'll explain it
master up takes sellers and buyers lots
of buyers and puts them together the
more people buy the lower the price goes
they've got deals on all kinds of stuff
knives camping supplies keyboards
headphones for example and you can check
it all out again at that link in the
video description so thanks for watching
