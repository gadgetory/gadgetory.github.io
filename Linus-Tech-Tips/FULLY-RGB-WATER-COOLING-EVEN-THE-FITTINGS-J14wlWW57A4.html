thing anyone talks about these days even
us I'm sure you guys saw the RGB build
guide well one of our writers Jake saw
it too and in a fit of what I can only
describe as nerd jealousy concoct it up
his own version of it in an attempt to
go even further over the top by doing
RGB hard line water cooling and given
how much you guys hated the anti RGB
build I mean this is clearly what you
want to see so i greenlit it
Corsairs Boyd pro gaming headsets
feature microfiber mesh fabric and
memory foam ear cups as well as custom
tuned 50 millimeter neodymium drivers
check them out at the link below the
first step in any build is always parts
Alexa don't wait this time it was
actually pretty interesting there were
some legitimately tense moments when
Jake wasn't sure if he was going to be
able to one-up James by finding RGB
components for every single part of a
water cooling loop but in the end he did
so moving on then an RGB CPU block
wasn't hard to find however most of the
products on the market were either cheap
knockoffs or just downright hideous
fortunately our friends over at ek had
the perfect solution their Strix z2 70 e
mono block it keeps the V RMS and the
CPU nice and chilly while also looking
dank AF this was actually our first time
using a full cover motherboard block so
we'll spend a little more time on this
first the stock motherboard VR on heat
sinks need to be removed then you cut
and stick on the included thermal pads
you may also need to remove the plastic
IO fascia piece being careful with any
connected cables while you do it yeah
then with everything prepped we put our
7700 K in since this is a gaming machine
and applied a generous amount of thermal
goop Ram was next and while we actually
tried to stay away from non water
cooling RGB parts to keep the focus on
the RGB loop g.skill Trident Z's are
just too irresistible so we went with a
4 by 8 gig config to get all them slots
populated in and does that ever look
good next it was time to lay the
monstrous Thermaltake Tower 900 on its
side and removed the glass to make
installation easy or at least possible
in went the IO shield and in went asus
strix
z2 70 ii a solid motherboard choice for
example features overclocking capability
and most importantly compatibility with
our RGB block as for the GPU we went
with in videos flagship GT X 1080 Ti
because why the heck not right but
getting an RGB block for the graphics
card ended up being one of the most
difficult parts to source for the build
most of what's out there in RGB is for
the base 1080
fortunately fantex is a lot better at
building sexy products than they are at
making a website so after we overcame
some bad SEO we set to work getting it
installed it did take a while man is it
ever worth it and just wait for when
it's lit up by far the most
time-consuming part of this build was
the hard line tubing even after all the
time spent planning out the loop things
changed as they always seem to do and
hard line tubing is challenging enough
when you're just doing basic plumbing
when all of a sudden you want to power
every one of the fittings to light up
your tubing well it adds a whole new
dimension of difficulty every single
fitting needs to be individually powered
ah
holy crap let's talk about the rest of
the cooling system the star of the show
here is easily the dual quad 140
millimeter radiators installed in the
back now look I know this is basically
the most overkill possible setup and we
could probably cool like for thread
Ripper systems with it but if you
haven't come to expect overkill here at
Lana's tech tips then what kind of fan
are you speaking of fans the obvious
choice was our LT t Edition not to a
fans again because this is about RGB
water cooling not RGB air cooling
now the original plan for holding our
tubes in place where they're converted
to soft tubing behind the motherboard
tray was to 3d print some mounting
brackets on the
to make her three but then came a stroke
of jerry-rigged University engineering
genius how about tension mounts with zip
ties and acres at the back and it worked
so with that system in place the tubes
were cut to a manageable length and then
finished off with an RGB fitting tied to
a 90 degree angle to adapt to our soft
tubing hard in the front
lots of wiggle room in the back we
actually really like this style of
hardline since it makes maintenance much
easier
finally cable management Oh lordie cable
management even with sexy cable mod
cables running the eight million
individual wires for every fitting
around the back was a challenge to say
the least but look at this it's actually
coming together quite nicely all of the
fittings conveniently plug into a single
controller giving the tubes a really
pleasing glow that should be made even
more impressive once primo chills opaque
white coolant concentrate is added
finally time to fill our CPU and GPU are
actually on completely separate loops so
we started on the GPU side these
gargantuan radiators take a huge amount
of water to fill but we eventually got
them both filled up and with zero leaks
I'm impressed
which isn't to say that we didn't forget
anything we had to unscrew the cap of a
filled reservoir to put on the RGB
reservoir holder rings but it was
totally worth it then the cherry on top
was a non RGB corsair MP 500 SSD that we
couldn't install earlier because someone
else had it in their test bench her
pitter finally though we added the
coolant concentrate actually plugged in
our mono block and dad haters gonna hate
but if you're being honest with yourself
I think you have to admit this is one of
the best-looking builds we've ever done
and if you're not ready to admit that
yet well here's what I think will be
enough uninterrupted straight PC

master Brandon to change your mind
you can time
because you say
this video has been brought to you by
tunnel bear the easy-to-use VPN app oh I
have new talking points bear trivia is a
trendy topic at parties these days but
sometimes you just don't have enough
facts to back up your opinion
fortunately we have some random bear
trivia for you here are a couple quick
ones to keep you in the game bears might
look slow and clumsy but they can run up
to 30 miles an hour for extended periods
of time if you see a bear don't try to
outrun it in Alabama it's illegal to
keep or train bears for the purposes of
wrestling someone tries to sell you
tickets to bear wrestling or ask you to
hold their seat while they buy some
honey just say no now kick the bear
factor up another notch with the app
that roars from your pocket while it
encrypts your data Tritonal bear for
