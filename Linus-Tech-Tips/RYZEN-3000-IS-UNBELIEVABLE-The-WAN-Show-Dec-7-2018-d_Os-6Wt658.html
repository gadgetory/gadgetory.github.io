rise in 3000 so to talk to topics that
you care about we're also gonna discuss
YouTube rewind I only made it about
halfway through so really it might have
gotten a lot better towards the end okay
I kind of suspect it didn't i'll wait
we'll get into that later and finally
csgo is now free and also gets a battle
royale mode because every gaming I don't
know I'm refused to talk about that
as a prime player you know no you're
baiting me I said I wasn't going to talk
about this as a prime player you can
just not know dude against Yahoo are not
prime players I want to talk about oh
okay no I want to start with the really
important stuff so yeah Luke and I had a
meeting today no boy we are gonna be
make oh well today is actually like kind
of the team announcement Juancho you
know I'm so excited for one of them it's
gonna be love incredible okay so first
of all good shirt choice by the way
floatplane Thank You flow plane has some
big milestones coming up yeah which none
of the team knows about at the end of
this year yeah so it's gonna be actually
pretty freakin awesome yeah and one of
the things that's gonna happen before
then is live streaming support with chat
and all that cool stuff is dropping very
very soon so you can expect if you're a
floatplane member you are going to be
simultaneously multi casting we are
gonna be simultaneously multi casting to
youtube 22 and floatplane calm next
Friday
yeah so that's gonna happen exciting I
can't promise special treatment for the
floatplane chat and in other news
YouTube rewind dropped yesterday yeah
yeah okay so yeah why did you only make
it halfway
okay sorry one of the faux play guys
just said a inside joke and that caught
me off guard
so why did you only make it halfway
through okay so here's that they have a
confession to make I've never made it
no I did I think the year pewdie be
PewDiePie became number one I might have
made it all the way through because I
remember seeing the bit at the end with
him like walking on the beach or
something is that exactly
I thought it I don't know if it ends
that way your start so that he like
picks up the play button on the beach oh
crap maybe that was the start it was
good okay so hold on a second so I have
to confess that I don't think I have
ever made it all the way through a
rewind because I don't really watch
YouTube so for me it's kind of like this
parade of people that I don't know who
the heck they are well I think that's
the problem right now
so that was one key difference this year
is I knew who marques was yeah I knew
who arms he's amazing um have you
watched his this is totally off topic
have you watched his camera phone
comparison oh the bracket that he's
doing well I don't really watch YouTube
but I'm aware that he's doing it it's
done it's up oh okay yeah it's actually
really interesting okay good you should
watch it okay all right well like skip
to the end bracket I'll skim through it
okay yeah that's like the most that's a
compliment like he's he doesn't watch
the fact that he's gonna skim through it
and like actually enough information
like that's not that's not that's not a
side against the video that's that's
pretty good I recognize rob technical
guru ji I recognized yeah like I don't
know for like three seconds yes cuz I
didn't see he's like on the island and
he's like oh I think we should
acknowledge people who like jumping
different people yeah okay and then I
recognized Emma Chamberlain who I'm only
aware of because I was reading an
article on something about something and
somehow I ended up looking at the
streamys Awards and she was the breakout
creator and then I spent actually
probably about an hour and a half on her
channel trying to get it and what I
realized is that I still don't really
get it and I'm probably not gonna start
watching YouTube anytime soon
anyway so other than that I didn't
really know who anybody was I think okay
so I think that's a big problem with
YouTube rewind so back in like 2012-2013
when do we get that
oh yeah yeah yeah 2012 YouTube rewinds
like I think okay 2011 2010 they had a
2010 I don't know when they actually
started it but they called this was
called YouTube rewind year in reviews so
over 250 million views combined and it's
like kind of a clip show from your TV
screen it has like all of that guys
awesome the Old Spice commercial go oh
it's got a bunch of Twilight on it
there's a crying child yeah so this is
like pretty low grade compared to what
they but like if you notice that it's
big goes back that far did you not
screen shine by the way so I know we can
do this one one thing you'll notice from
this rewind is it's showing things that
happened that mattered that got a lot of
use of the year and Neri wines are just
powered by YouTube trends as opposed to
powered by YouTube arbitrary yeah and
and new rewinds are here's a bunch of
people doing completely intensely
unrelated things for the most part or
like vague for trait for tonight fork
knife that was not that was not very
noted the beginning like this none of it
none of it matters none of it actually
represented like impactful things for
the year there was no T series there was
no yeah year review there was none of
that kind of stuff
how was T series not even if you don't
include PT bag is the stuff that's
happened with him and whatever whatever
that's a totally different conversation
well how was T series not a part of that
yeah that what like like it's very it's
very it's very cleaned off like Google
is pushing hard into India don't imagine
for a second that any of this T series
and rising in prominence of Indian
channels don't imagine for a second any
of this is a random accident like Google
is pushing really hard they're pushing
on Chrome they're pushing on Android
they're pushing on YouTube they are
pushing into India okay so some people
are saying the PewDiePie dramas for
teenagers we're saying completely
regardless of the Pipers fact that it's
happening t series is still massive and
they're huge
the Indian YouTube is exploding and he's
like fortnight not for teenagers
I mean it featured very prominently in
the rewind and as far as I could I mean
I went to the Halloween store and there
were fortnight costumes they didn't have
adult sizes I'm thinking they probably
know their demographic yeah this man
shows gotten real uncomfortable i-i-i
think I think with rewind they're trying
to make it extremely advertiser friendly
yeah and they're trying to bring in safe
acts and for some reason they're no
longer trying to just show really cool
or important or high view things that
happen throughout the year they're just
trying to take people that are
advertiser friendly and put them across
like I love that mark has had a speaking
part that's not cool
but I almost would have liked it better
if he was just like sitting on one of
the seats on the bus like talking about
his phone and like showing it to someone
as they had panned along it like I loved
that he had a speaking part but it felt
off-topic or if he had a speaking part I
would have liked for it too because if
you don't yeah you won't have any idea
from watching rewind another thing in my
opinion if they're gonna do it this way
yeah I disagree with but if they're
gonna do it this way where they're just
like scattershot popular people that are
brand friendly into the video yeah they
should have little things I think this
is this person yeah as you watch the
thing and you're like who are all these
people and maybe the persons on there
for 60 frames like you barely see them
and that's but that's where I think the
context comes in as well because at
least that yeah that would help that
would help it's like it's kind of like
does anyone remember when you're a kid
right and you're in the grocery store
with your parents and like one of your
teachers is standing there like
comparing you know the quality of like
apples or whatever you're like you exist
in real life mrs. Fraser
yes stops at the grocery store because
when you see somebody outside of the
normal context that you expect to see
them in
it's very easy to not recognize them in
this case people that you know in real
life yeah like if I ran into you know
I'm not gonna pick someone that I work
with everyday like if I ran into Luke on
the street obviously I'm gonna okay even
though we ran into each other on the
street okay oh wait I'm gonna use the
story for this I ran into Dmitry in
Germany okay I had no idea Dmitry was
hard right connects yeah for contact I
had no idea he was in Germany sure he
had no idea I was in Germany we walked
past each other randomly on the street
and it takes a second cuz you're like
this doesn't make any sense at all right
like it what like I totally knew who he
was but I was like is this a
doppelganger like what's it's it's a
weird moment it's very jarring see were
like what yeah that happens that's
pretty yeah so this was a long time I
don't know I only made it about halfway
through just because like it's it's not
really it's kind of the same reason that
I don't watch like the Grammys and the
Oscars because a lot of the time it's
movies and songs movies I haven't seen
songs I haven't heard and people who I I
don't really know who they are like
there's a handful of like very famous
actors and or musicians musicians in
particular I don't watch music videos
it's not like like I have an objection
to them or anything I just when I listen
to music it's usually when I'm doing
something else and that doing something
else isn't staring straight ahead at the
screen watching the video that goes with
it it's like something actually totally
unrelated so so I actually a lot of the
time I don't recognize musicians yeah
and so I just like I just don't find it
that interesting I don't really follow
the storylines like I don't really pay
attention to celebrity gossip or
anything like that so it's just not
really interesting for me to just see a
parade of people that I don't really
know who the crap they are or why I did
yeah like I liked seeing marques cuz it
was cool having someone featured really
prominently that's in our community yeah
and it was really funny to see that PD
PI's chair made it in but he didn't
that was really entertaining one of the
animators that was featured yeah I do
like the chair doing this but no it's
just it's them
like moving in a room like going from
the camera be like hey and then like
moving away and it's all animated it's a
little cartoon yeah but the chair that
they're in is very clearly PewDiePie's
like clutch chair with the like swirly
red and black design cottage it's hey
it's kind of a interesting color that
happened there all right the last day
says can you guys talk about something
that matters like yeah fact that Jesus
is coming back very soon and the whole
world is going to suffer judgment all
right so let's move on then from that
topic and let's move on to the big
announcement for this man show oh oh my
goodness I'm actually so excited the
actual big announcement well it's funny
we have made it twenty minutes into the
wine show and I have not even opened up
the topics dock yet that may be a new
record
I'm extremely like I might be more
excited than the people in the audience
okay about this LTX 2019 the details are
somewhat coming together mmm okay first
of all mark your calendars now July 27th
and 28th two days whoa what two days two
days well hold on a second surely
they're gonna kick us out of the venue
overnight right wait what wrong I'm so
excited
LTX 2019 is going to be bigger badder
and better than ever two days oh my god
with an overnight land party oh my god
powered by our partner for the event
Dreamhack yeah so we have been working
on this with them since basically oh man
the end of LTX 2018 when we went you
know what we did a lot of stuff that was
better than last year but there is still
a ton of room for improvement here so
cool I can't give you guys but but
basically we were like yeah we need to
take it up a significant notch it's as
long as to be more than
a fan meetup which it has done a great
job of being but last year we had other
creators there like coming out and
crawling out of the woodwork know it
Steve from gamers Nexus we had Jays
$0.02 we had Barnett Cleese there we had
Lewis Rossmann there and we're kind of
looking at this going we'll hold on a
second
those guys came they had fun all of them
and I you know I'm not gonna put words
in their mouths but all of them
expressed interest and at least may be
participating in 2019 so we're looking
at it going like hey well we need to
like if we're gonna have like gonna step
it up big creators coming in and like
being sort of part of this experience we
need like a creator meetup space and we
need like we need better food options
and we need we need a bigger space so
guess what we got a bigger space we are
stepping it up we're moving into the big
time so the original plan was to take I
think it was a couple of the couple of
the ballrooms or a couple of them like
three of the meeting rooms and then one
of the ballrooms or something like that
in the East Building of the Vancouver
Convention Center so we actually we went
even further than that not a hockey rink
this and with nope with no plan really
for exactly how we're gonna fill it
other than that we're just gonna take a
lot of what we've done a lot of new
ideas from the community oh they're
getting so much food space so we're
making every booth bigger good every
booth better and we are gonna have
something to the tune of like 30,000
square feet or something ridiculous like
that is going to be a gigantic space I
think I can say that we are going to
have you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna
check what is in the blog because we
have actually added a blog to the LTX
LTX Expo com
oh hold on just a minute here no you
shown the dock site yeah that's fine but
it really matters you put Oh have we not
have we not done it yet oh right
December 7 wow this is this is a really
great website very broken there we go
LTX 2019 and dreamhack coming to
Vancouver so cool page could be better
but don't worry we're
making word we don't have time to make
the this this thing good huge
partnership thrilled to be partnering
the three okay well man I kind of you
know I'm gonna I'm gonna jump the gun a
little bit there's gonna be a BYOC so
but we're partner with tree I thought
that was like a given
well they do other things okay okay so
there's gonna be a BYOC line how many
seats can we say I know but we can't say
okay okay because you never know there
could be like a slight seating
rearrangement or its power constraint
restrictions or whatever sure you never
know you never know there's still a lot
is that makes sense but we have paid the
deposit on the Vancouver Convention
Center oh it will be in the Vancouver
Convention Center so there will be way
better access to hotels and
transportation you can take the SkyTrain
there tons of food like better packs
west yeah furred as far as I can tell my
entire life I think the next one will be
by like 12th or 13th event I lost track
somewhere along the line I'm really
excited I'm potentially I'm I'm willing
to say I'm more excited about this event
then than packs which is like that's a
very hard thing for me to say you're
kind of a pack Sandlin I am crying
you're being honest yeah yeah but like
LTX is legitimately and I'm I'm not even
technically a part Alliance before you
group anymore
so I have no real technical incentives
to even say this LTX is doing everything
that I think they should do
burning with Dreamhack is a really good
idea making the event two days is a
really good idea a lot of people are
flying in flying in for one like eight
ish hours yeah we always knew it was
just and there's growing news and the
costs and this year
quite honestly what okay so this is the
biggest BSR ever know the directive to
Colton so the directive to Colton
previously was break even right on the
event we didn't expect it to make money
but we didn't really
want to lose a bunch of money the
directive this year is look- Media Group
and - tech tips doesn't really do a ton
of marketing and quite frankly a ton of
community engagement yeah so this this
is our community engagement budget for
the year blow it blow it all oh yeah so
we are already it's gonna be so cool
we're already engaging with like actual
professional booth building and
designing companies I can't promise
we'll use them but people at least get
some inspiration we we really really
want to take it to to a completely
different I think the thing is there's
there's I can't really think of any
conventions at least in North America
that are hard we're focused not that
there won't be games there but it's hard
we're focused about community event and
their taxes definitely might be games
there yeah
taxes become less and less Hardware
focused over time yeah they've been more
and more gaming and it's more and more
like giant triple-a companies it's not
as like smaller company it's much less
hands-on we're aware of the Indies own
yeah but okay if if I'm not promising
anything
thank you if we had any indie developers
show up show up to you know show off
their wares at LTX 2019 there would be a
hard and fast rule that you have to have
a booth that doesn't suck and I get it
you're an indie developer and it's hard
we would be happy to help but you can't
just have a table with like a vinyl
banner behind you and like I did I hate
to stereotype but like to nerdy guys
sitting there at the desk with some
business card no it has to be playable
it has to be cool it has to be like it
has to not suck yeah I'm asking yeah so
it's just I'm I'm inked extremely
intrinsically excited about this LTX I
think the the main things I wanted
improved is like the lines were crazy
and
and the main stage was okay so VR has
what three headsets so we figure the
minimum for this coming year is
somewhere between 15 and 20 yeah
like dice insane and goof makes ahem we
just kind of like we kind of like lay it
out like so that you can make it
somewhat space-efficient but like yeah
we know absolutely we know we know we
screwed up a lot of stuff last year
screwed but had a lot of constructive
criticism yeah but I don't think it's
good it's our second convention it's not
tannic on it's not like the whatever
that tumblr convention was like it
succeeded people were happy it's just
growing pains and I'm just super excited
for this year's upgrade it was thrilling
to me that people showed up to LTX 2018
with like signed stuff from LTX 2017
wanting to get it like signed again like
where where there's already that
grassroots sort of movement to make this
sort of worth migrating for and we know
that Vancouver is not easy but that's
one of the reasons that we're announcing
it way earlier this time around you have
literally seven months to get a passport
or figure out time off or whatever else
we're also doing it for two days so that
it is somewhat justifiable to come up
here
Vancouver's a beautiful city give it a
chance we're doing it in the summer for
a couple of reasons number one is so
that people aren't in school and
remember that applies to both you know
younger people and older people who are
also in school so we're doing it in
june/july so that people aren't in
school we're also doing it in July
because the weather tends to be
absolutely fantastic here in July if
you're into hiking if you're into food
Vancouver is a great place to go for
food whether you I mean pretty much
Richmond I get so spoiled because living
in Vancouver
I'll whether I'm travel to Asia or the
US or like pretty much anywhere it's
like yeah foods great but like honestly
it's not that different from if I just
go to have like
shop yeah there's probably shop not that
far away that happens essentially
exactly
Chinese food Japanese food Dennis said
by the list in Chinese food is better
here like okay I could get on I could
get into a whole thing about sort of
like quality yeah enough time in Asia
for like people talk about yeah foods
cheap in Asia I'm like okay there's a
difference between food being cheap and
cheap food being cheap I had the most
horrifying hamburger and I know that's
what I get for ordering hamburger but I
had just about the most horrifying
hamburger and like Brunei or something
stupid like that it was like look it was
a moment of weakness it was like halfway
through my trip it was the trip from
hell we had to six month old infants
with us like we were there because
someone in the family was dying turns
out they weren't dying he's still alive
not was like four years ago anyway look
the point is like it was the worst and
and and and even the more authentic
things because it's the entire rest of
the trip I had to eat more authentic
stuff because I was with my life and all
of her family and we weren't gonna go to
like like the white people friendly
place because of the 1y actually there
were two white guys there me and my
brother-in-law and anyway we weren't
gonna go there just because of us we
were like okay we're gonna make the best
of it and I was I was actually far less
open-minded about authentic food at that
point it was it was it was rough so and
and everything else honestly was not
great either I was like ya know I can
understand why this doesn't cost very
much because it's like very low-grade
and that yeah fine some stuff is really
good some stuff is really good there
were exceptions but food in Vancouver is
great LTX so don't think of it as like
you have to buy a plane ticket just to
go to like a one-day convention because
a it's two days now it's two days now
and if it was overnight which is
something conventions haven't done in a
long time and it's actually really cool
cuz that like three or four in the
morning at a convention the whole vibe
changes okay so to be clear
the actual booths will not be open up
it'll be the BYOC area yes I'm sure
that's how it works everywhere that's
completely fine but like the whole vibe
of the convention changes it's really
really cool I suggest trying to stay up
for a while
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do
it I probably will okay cuz like I'm
gonna be on stage a lot but one should
add a two even if you could and the
night of the first day I got my
Backstreet Boys concert I heard about
that you're actually gonna leave LTX to
go there look the concert was but wow
they moved the date while TX on me I
didn't have it Wow look I never saw them
when they were relevant so Wow I want to
see that look look look
I'll be there all over in Bates has your
name on all day during the day no I
don't think it does does it oh I think
isn't that for Linus tech tips which is
technically like a it's more of a brand
than my name it's at least two your
phones two-thirds not my name you like
to say your names on the building well I
just that's like yeah that's just me
like playing that you know asshat
characters that I play but that's that's
Luke Seeley anyways so I'll go for the
concert and then what I may do is come
back for a bit but I can't like stay up
on me no you should sleep I like have to
be on stage and like greeting things it
will probably make the show better if
you see but I I'm probably gonna buy a
BYOC ticket anyway just so that
hopefully I can get in and play some
games and stuff oh right cuz ya know
that make sense well no I could get a
free ticket but for me it's just more
the principle of the thing
I'll just buy a ticket like there's
gonna be a finite number of seats and so
if I was like yeah you know I want a
free ticket my brother wants a free
ticket and all my staff need free
tickets and it's like you know this is a
partnership yeah we need to make sure
that it makes sense for for Dreamhack
and it makes sense for Lance Media Group
because you know who knows you know what
this kind of turns into or doesn't turn
into this is I think pretty experimental
for both of us yeah so yeah we're we're
tournaments and stuff I think their
approach is going to be relatively
low-key this time okay I don't want to
promise any I don't really like big
professional tournaments I mean like are
they gonna do like I really don't know I
would love to like impromptu shoutcast a
rocket League tournament guess I've
actually done this before
really yeah okay and I actually think
I'm pretty decent at it for rocket
League okay and that would be really fun
well you know what Colton I think is
watching land show because he sent me
this really upset message I've been
trying to fix the blog for an hour long
so I'm sure he heard you say that Colton
if you want any amount of free help or
labor outside of standard hours I'm down
to do whatever I will sacrifice my body
to try to make LTX better one not even
kidding one thing that might help us
make LTX better is making sure that we
get through our sponsors today
because if we don't survive until you
know the next LTX then that would be a
shame and that would be a shame don't
worry we're fine so first up is the
elgato mini stream deck it allows you to
concentrate on your stream instead of
trying to memorize keyboard shortcuts or
fussing around with the mouse why did
they put it down there I didn't even
know it was here I didn't know they set
one of these up here this is awesome now
I can switch to my screen you can smile
back concerned it's not set up very
broken
well whatever it looks it does work
because this is awesome so check this
out every single one of the buttons is a
little LCD display you can't see that at
all so you can actually see me and Luke
there you can see what it's supposed to
be so you don't have to memorize
anything and you can program them to do
pretty much anything that you could want
so you just click the button and whether
you want to you know graphically
excuse me whether you want to buddy help
whether you want to like switch scenes
in a stream or whether you want to
execute a macro in Adobe Premiere which
is what Taryn uses the two of them that
he has at his desk for you can do it on
the stream deck they're less than 100
bucks they're available for Mac or
Windows and you can learn more at the
link in know well they don't have it in
our lower third but that's okay building
fresh books fresh books is the super
simple to use invoicing tool for small
business owners and freelancers that
does a lot more than just help you
create and send slick
looking invoices you can track your time
with the tension manage your expenses
that is such an inside joke at this
point manage your expenses and keep
track of who owes you what it also has a
feature that tells you when your client
looks at an invoice for the first time
their mobile ad has all the
functionality of the desktop version so
you can take fresh books with you
wherever you go
and accounting can be confusing fresh
books is all about helping with that
it's about making it simple and if you
have any questions you can reach out to
their support staff where you will speak
to a real human being
no phone tree no escalations no return
calls later just answers to help you out
and as we learned in part one of our PC
manufacturers trying to screw you or
whatever we ended up calling that such a
cool series just being able to talk to
someone when you're frustrated can be
can make all the difference so go to
FreshBooks dot-com / win and enter when
in the how did you hear about s section
by the way part 2 is on on focalin
already it has been part 3 is coming to
floatplane on Tuesday as well I'm
excited with the sweet sriracha
barbecues but it's not a jerky yeah
their goal is to make a tasty turkey
without nitrates or preservatives that's
not bad for you but it's still full of
flavor and spice they've got 13
different flavors my favorite is the
maple buffalo bacon original is great
the what's the what's the green one mo
huh yeah anything Moho is good they also
make barbecue sauce hot sauce a spice
rub their Carolina Reaper hot sauces
uses one of the hottest peppers in the
world the Carolina Reaper and you can
use offer coat LTE to save 10% at savage
jerky dot-com we'll have that linked
below if you're watching the archive all
right should we do some tech news we
should probably talk about rising 3,000
hits ring that's the title okay correct
so the original article is from reddit
of all places that make sense
there you go rise in 3000 will be on
tsmc 7 nanometre hpc so basically
horizon 1000 2000 were built on Samsungs
14 nanometer low-power process this was
part of the reason that there was a 4
gigahertz hard cap on clock speed like
verizon thread ripper they are not
overclockable it's not that they're like
hard to overclock they're just not
really overclockable so because of this
limit in terms of their frequency they
had a really hard time making up any
ground on Intel's processors
particularly in gaming where single
threaded high clock speed performance is
key so then to is rumored to be made on
TSM C's 7 nanometers high performance
process this could give us a 13% boost
in clocks compared to low powers 4.6
gigahertz putting rise in three thousand
over five gigahertz along with this we
are expecting a 15% IPC improvement
along with eight cores per CC X which
should mean less communication between
the interconnects and faster memory so
if you were to extrapolate a 15% IPC so
that's instructions per clock uplift
plus a 15% improvement in the raw clock
speed that could be a 30% improvement in
performance it is also sort of
anticipated that the Spector meltdown
foreshadow hardware fixes will hit Intel
about 10% harder than Verizon meaning it
could be possible that rise in 3000
could be 10% faster than core in single
threaded workloads this is according to
though reddit.com slash are slash AMD
stock so take it with more salt that is
was used to preserve this jerky yeah
do I get a tech stock no there's you
know the problems there oh yeah that's
right yeah
long story yeah long story actually yeah
so no but like it's actually been pretty
wild only take this for what it is the
only times I have ever owned tech stock
I owned like a couple thousand dollars
of Nvidia probably pre LMG so this must
have been about eight years ago or
something like that and then I owned
like I don't know five thousand dollars
or something like that of OCZ shortly
before they disappeared I was I was I
got out okay yeah I got it
nice all right I actually I made a
little bit of money on that stock and it
was like kind of thrilling and it was
cool and I was like whoa I'm like
playing the market um apparently you did
okay with that if you got out before
yeah I made money on in video as well
hmm
but I pulled out because well I'm okay I
pulled out because I was like no I'm new
to this you know I made some money okay
I'm gonna like call that good yeah and
then OCZ completely went supernova and I
was like you know what eff this I'm out
I don't invest so I didn't put any money
back into in video which probably
would've been a good idea they were
around $17 at that time anyway I mean
whatever it's all again then I got into
LMG and it really seemed like a very
obvious conflict of interest duh so
anyway take this from people who are
obsidian where we're sitting
I have no ownership stake of any tech
company actually I don't think I own any
stocks at all right now
yeah zero zero stocks and then do you
own any no no okay what tech stocks
would you buy hmm and remember okay
we're not gonna be experts when it comes
to you know the what is it the dead cat
bounce or like whatever you know like
like all that stocky yeah investment tee
stuff I'm just talking as no amazement
people over the next three to five years
who do you expect to just kill it in
terms of the actual tech which
theoretically at some point although I
can't quite find the correlation
sometimes theoretically at some
point should affect the stock price yeah
I see okay that's actually one thing I
was gonna bring up it's like I don't
know what current speculation is so
things that would be inflated I don't
know if they are not but like if we
completely ignore all of that I
genuinely do think AMD would be a good
position you think so yeah like long
Andy yes short AMD is scary because
they're like all over the place yeah
yeah long AMD like just to be clear I
track it just because I'm curious but
they're there platform for CPUs right
now is really strong and as we can see
whether this rumor is true or not the
fact that it's like that could be
possible has a lot of potential in it
and Intel is in a really bad spot
they're kind of locked until looks good
on paper because their revenue is great
yeah they're forecasting might look
pretty darn good but the problem is that
and we talked about this a lot back when
we talked about AMD launching their 32
core epic processors the long lead time
on enterprise where from the inception
of a project like a supercomputer to the
actual putting of CPUs into sockets
could be a year 18 months two years like
in some cases you end up actually
building a custom facility for the damn
thing before you even actually cut a Pio
for any computer hardware like that's
the kind of scale these projects operate
on so Intel's revenues might look really
good because they have contracts locked
in from before AMD was even remotely
competitive but that situation can
change and if AMD can stay very
competitive and or even be a leader in
certain aspects of that space we're
gonna start to see it soon yeah and like
okay I don't want any of this to be
interpreted as actually advising anyone
to do anything please note as far as I'm
concerned Lee's investing in stocks is
gambling yeah you might as well put you
know ten thousand on black and spin the
wheel as far as I'm concerned because
there are so many factors like you
definitely more to it than that but like
yeah you could have well yes and no
because look at look at what happened to
hard drives back in what was it 2011
when there was the the flooding in
Thailand right yeah Thailand Thailand
flooding it completely destroyed their
revenue and then it was the crazy thing
so destroyed their revenue everyone
dumped them and then their profit
margins went way up because supply was
constrained and they were a hot item
yeah yo you understand what is even
going on the business fundamentals never
really changed here I just think like
instead of a what is it like forty eight
point five or something percentage
chance if you go on a black or red I
think you can try to push that
percentage a little bit yeah but you can
also push that percentage at the
blackjack table that's true like you
don't have to play roulette you did use
roulette
that's true I'm just saying be cut like
war could break out and it's and that
will wrap and that's actually like a
scary possibility like it's a funny
thing to talk about because in our
lifetimes our generation there have been
wars there was the war in Afghanistan
but if we're being if we're being honest
with ourselves
conflicts that was not a war compared to
the Second World War
yeah like the are the previous
generation saw war to the degree with
that the entire country is mobilized you
know people who aren't working are kind
of being rounded up to produce bullets
in impromptu factories so that the
soldiers overseas will have enough
bullets like it's different it's very
different and when that happens there
are some companies that can flourish and
there's other companies that will
absolutely not tech companies might
actually even do okay
I wouldn't think consumer tech companies
would do okay but certain enterprise
tech companies might do completely fine
so we're just trying to say that no
matter what it is no matter how sure the
outlook is anything could happen so it
really is a gamble well I'm the only one
that answered though what do you what
are you oh I have it I have a few other
like maybe in
justing idea once but I want to I want
to hear from you this isn't something
I've thought about so I really I don't
know I actually think Amazon is far from
capped out personally for sure like I I
thought I always have a problem with
including them in this type of stack
because you're talking I thought we were
talking about like like tech companies
were I think they have plenty of room to
continue to innovate and continue to
take over the world like if there's
anyone who's gonna be the by and large
from wall-e it's gonna be Amazon oh
absolutely
have you seen their their like the
revenue stack of Amazon versus all these
other retail companies no it's insane
I don't know where that picture is from
but it like it includes so many physical
retailers that are like really big names
that are just a tiny fraction of the
revenue that Amazon's pulling like it's
absolute madness yeah I don't think
there's an insight for them either I
think I think there's I think there's
plenty of room for them especially
because they've already gone global
they've got they've sort of opening up
India and they are sophisticated so yeah
Amazon I I wanted to put like a quarter
of my net worth in Amazon like five
years ago
which like it wasn't you know like a
huge amount of money or anything but it
was like a big bet for me
well that was around the time that
instead we found it lands meager so you
know what Linus media group has been a
worked out great but Amazon also
wouldn't a bit so yeah I tried to get I
sent a yeah was it a letter I don't know
this was a long time ago pre halo one
yeah I tried to the the only person I
knew that had any form of money was my
grandpa so I like wrote a thing and gave
it to my grandpa trying to get my
grandpa to invest in Bungie pre halo one
before the game was out I was like this
is gonna be insane
and I'm a kid I have no money I can't do
it but I'm like someone needs to do this
and that was a no so there was no Bungie
investment at that time I don't even
know if they were I didn't know anything
back then I don't know if they were a
publicly traded company like I have no
clue that was even possible I was just
like I think my grandpa was just like
okay do we have to talk about this I
mean wait what which one
oh so tf2 used to be fun do you was so
much fun and then they made it
free-to-play and there were hats
everywhere that was legitimately when I
stopped playing tf2 used to actually be
really fun the problem with free-to-play
is that there's no real there's no real
venom in the in the vacban thanks yeah
because you can just use do I still call
them Smurfs accounts yeah okay so you
can just use smartphones and you can
create as many accounts as you want and
the ban just means nothing IP is so easy
to get around these days very easy get a
get a PA a subscription so I don't want
to be like that but it's kind of a
different community in games where it's
people who can afford to pay 20 bucks
all right so one thing that I'm gonna
throw in here is Prime status so you
were asking about this early on if you
bought counter-strike before it went
free-to-play you have prime status and
if you pay the equivalent of buying the
game you can buy prime status forever
forever it's a one-time purchase and you
can filter matches so that you only play
against prime enabled people oh okay so
like my account okay I actually didn't
know that you guys plays against prime
enabled accounts so prime status matches
you with Prime's and if I'm trying done
for prime you have to like you have to
put your phone number in so like if your
prime account gets bad your phone number
gets banned okay I'm like there's some
other you I think you have to play a
minimum amount before you can actually
match make it that even if you buy a
prime account like there's thing I don't
remember all of it I'm sorry but there
is additional requirements as well like
yeah prime match ranking is pretty cool
there is still plenty of hackers on
prime matchmaking
wingman before they the most people even
in the counselor community know what
wingmen is but wingmen before they
enabled replays and before they enabled
what is it called the like was this
person cheating watch her thing I don't
know what that's called but whatever
before they enabled either of those
things was just a hive of villainy in
terms of hacking and when they enabled
those things it was insane the amount of
people that got banned to the next day
because there was all these replays of
people cheating in this special mode
that didn't have replays so then just
waves of bands it was it was glorious
because I I like to play that mode but
yeah it's okay so in addition to it
going for you play and the prime status
thing there's also a battle royale mode
one interesting thing about this battle
royale like a bill that got passed but
I'm not aware of so there's gonna be
done a battle royale like it's not
actually because I'd be kind of cool
there's everything already new dota 2
has a battle royale mode yeah I was like
I'm pretty sure it is
oh I already closed it I'm over okay so
danger zone most battle rails they're
like a hundred people right mm-hmm
this is sixteen that's not really Royale
it's much more less than battle fee is
really really tiny like it doesn't hear
the matches last about ten minutes each
that makes sense
you can you can play in solo duo or
trios there's no quad
there's no squad or quad or whatever you
want to call it you you pick up guns and
equipment and now armor and flashbangs
and there is a self heal thing which
kind of streak hasn't had before but
there is a self feel thing which makes
sense but you also pick up cash this
counter strike has always had the buying
make it right so you can buy stuff but a
drone will deliver it to you okay that's
interesting you have a tablet thing so
you can see the map and you can see the
drone coming to you but everyone else
can see the drone and it drops it on you
and like if you move a little bit it'll
go to where Hugh Clarke fishing so
people can hunt the drones down and this
is actually a really if you haven't
played before do this and get tons of
free kills trust
you hunt the drone down you followed the
drone and then you go to where it's
dropping it you sit a little bit away
you wait for it to drop and then you
just aim where it's dropping and some
dudes gonna run up and try to get it and
just shoot them it's amazing just free
kills all the time it's yeah it's
interesting it's one thing that I like
about it is the 10 minute matches even
if you win it's like a 10 minute matter
okay
thought faster that's one improvement
like battle right I had a lot of fun
playing Club G not for tonight so much
but I had a lot of fun playing pub G
like the handful of times I was able to
do it yeah but it was just it's really
long unless you could commit like three
hours to a gaming session you're not
really gonna get into your groove even
necessarily like we won our first and
third game I think it was so those
matches are really long they'd actually
gone for a very long time and that
that's been a problem with competitive
games for a long time is that their
matches last forever a competitive
counter-strike natural asset very long
time competitive league alleged to match
very long time dota 2 very long time
lots of these games are really really
long so having 10-minute matches is
actually very cool and like when you die
or when you win there's a play again
button sitting right there click it you
get right back into another game it's
really fast cool okay one plus a CEO
this was posted by dr. McIntosh on the
forum oh the previous one was princess
cadance and the previous one was dais of
voltage one plus a CEO tells the truth
about 5g the original article hears from
the verge and it's from an interview
with pete lau about qualcomm snapdragon
855 or no it's not this ss-sorry is that
the snapdragon tech summit in maui so he
said his company is working on both a
new 5 g1 plus phone and 4G phones in
parallel he expects the 5g phone will
cost as much as 200 to $300 more wrap
your head around that holy cow
so 5g is coming but it is not
necessarily going to be mainstream that
is one hell of a premium that's like a
g-sync addition to your phone so this
might not be the case for all news 5g
smartphones some might try to monetize
their existing customer
bass as much as they can just saying
well you know people will pay for it so
we're gonna price it it whatever
whatever we can
well others might try to gain market
share by offering 5g connectivity at a
cut-throat price one of the challenges
is going to be building 5g phones for
multiple carriers that can operate on
different that operate on different
frequencies so loud specs that it will
be even more difficult now this has
gotten easier over time as the as the
the antennas that have been integrated
into our phones have gotten broader and
broader support for 4G LTE frequencies
but now he expects it's gonna be even
more difficult to take a phone from one
carrier to another with 5g than it was
for 4G interesting they haven't seen a
solution that would cover different
carrier many carriers around the world
huh well that interesting scary that is
kind of scary as if phones weren't
expensive enough already so one plus is
5g phone is targeting just one type of
5g network the slower speeds but wider
coverage area sub six spectrum used by
EE its first carrier partner in Europe
in the u.s. 18 TM Verizon are both
focusing on the faster but lower range
millimeter wave and apparently on the
product level it's much more complex
than 4G like a significantly higher
level of challenge especially millimeter
wave hi it's gonna be interesting in
places like the US where like I mean
Canada has this problem too but I
literally think it's worse in the US the
coverage areas are already terrible
that's right let me have you like
shorter distance less penetration
through walls signals so this is
interesting
Walmart has apparently dropped the
pricing of their overpowered gaming PC's
I guess to just get rid of them and then
I don't know I guess to just get rid of
them and either refresh them with better
motherboards or just get rid of them
outright fascinating it's too bad
because I actually think that there was
potential for them to
like there were processes that seemed to
be fine across the board I was surprised
how many people were really upset about
the USB 3 port being hot glued in oh
yeah I mean that just didn't make any
sense to me but I didn't think was that
big of a deal
yeah but like people thought it was just
a horrendous thing like stuff gets hot
glued into people's pieces okay like
that's actually clinging some jostle
round and Shipman
yeah and hot glue especially because you
gotta remember - I actually didn't test
it I should have tested I should have
pulled it out there's lots of different
kinds of hot glue some of them are
actually designed to be quite easy to
peel off ya know though I thought you
were gonna say you were surprised people
were so upset about the USB - on the
front I was gonna say no I was pretty
upset about that the front ports were
USB - come on what year is it literally
didn't even know what you're talking
about that sounds really stupid very
very stupid especially with the amount
of USB three front headers you can get
now like you can actually put a lot up
there pretty easily was the CPU hot
glued in - no no no they got that part
right all right bringing us to the end
of the show with the super chat all
right do an lttb knee for real says
andrew there will be lots more merge
stuff stay tuned
yeah stay tuned Liam says will this work
it worked Liam mesh says what even what
are these super Chad's well sometimes
people don't like they say something
within the context of what's happening
at that exact second on the internet no
one knows you're a puppy that didn't
make sense at any point in this tree no
his name is pup Shepherd though so
daniel says when did you start growing a
beard Luke was it when your razor got
too dull I don't want to talk about it
but I'm looking for a barber cuz I'm
gonna try to have it shaped okay got it
I want to keep it going but it's a mess
so I just want it to be not a mess
Dennis asks why this is the 4790k still
a good CPU or is it worthwhile to
upgrade and if you were to upgrade would
you choose rise in her Intel I'm mostly
game
I would hold on to oh but I need more
course for other stuff okay what other
stuff yeah that would be helpful to know
if it's just for gaming no I would stick
with that maybe overclock it a little
bit if you need to do other stuff it
depends what the other stuff is and how
much of it you do if you do a lot of
other stuff and it needs a lot more
cores I'd go Rison if not then I'd
probably go 80 600 K or something like
that post on the forum yeah
SSA mjh says I just bought X 470 and
rise in 720 700 X so sad no don't be sad
good good come spirit mr. Sherwood says
subscribe to PewDiePie dave says love l
TT wanted to make another plea for a
retro gaming video team up with retro
RGB um I don't know exactly what we do
you know it's funny we get like collab
requests from other creators sometimes
and I got one quite recently that's like
I'm like yeah sure that would be kind of
neat but like what do we do what would
we do
I don't like collabing just for the sake
of cross-pollinating it feels thank you
yeah cross-pollinating yeah I just I
just don't care um barcia long cent $69
course he did
thoughts on intel missing the 10
nanometer node Oh
so for one thing I do want to point out
they didn't entirely miss it they do
actually they are actually shipping ten
down Demeter products right now a lot of
people don't know this they have nooks
that do have ten did you know this but
have ten nanometer processors in them
yeah yeah so they didn't they didn't
mess it all together but it's sort of in
the same way that they didn't entirely
miss broad well yeah right broad well
consumer to be clear broad well did make
it to hed TN enterprise but yes they did
they did miss broad well I'm a they do
up here to have missed 10 nanometer
because from what I've been seeing the
rumor is they're kind of trying to go
straight to 7
have you seen this as well yes um I
think we've no haven't we known that for
a bit so the thing about Intel is a lot
of people like to talk about Intel as
though Intel is a person with a singular
desire and a singular work ethic and a
singular sort of a moral compass as
though as though it was that simple
Intel is a lot of children company there
are a gigantic company something like a
hundred thousand employees and they even
just physical displacement of those
employees is very notable on the one
hand this is a pretty big black mark on
what is otherwise an astonishing record
of technological innovation over the
years on the other hand to me it's less
about Intel missing 10 nanometer and
more about Intel missing 10 nanometer
being indicative of where the technology
industry is going over the next 10 years
we have taken for granted that things
will just get faster and smaller with
better battery life we just assume that
every year there will be a new iPhone
that is better than the old one in some
meaningful way yeah that may actually
stop and it's funny because I remember
standing it was really weird it was kind
of like it was kind of like a Jesus
speech because Roger koduri
had just come back to AMD and I kind of
feel like they did it on purpose like he
was supposed to be kind of like the
Messiah to bring their graphics business
back from the brink meanwhile he's gone
now but anyway that's a whole other
thing so he's standing Marin Hawaii
and he's standing at the top of this
kind of Hill and we're all kind of
spread out in front of him not really
Wow like we just kind of hiked up to
this thing it was it was cool they were
like ruins and stuff anyway
there was ruins and stuff ruins ruins
yeah not those kinds I was like this is
getting pretty crazy
and he kind of stands up there and
declares AMD's graphics business
to be a software business and remember
this was was he wrong how programmable
have GPUs become in that time yeah and
that's effectively what that's that's
one piece of this of the puzzle of the
direction that we are moving overall and
Intel missing a node and your
applications getting faster and your
graphics in your games getting better
anyway is sort of an indication of what
is to come
software tomfoolery like with VR the way
that disagree inject extra frames to
accommodate that graphics cards haven't
gotten a lot faster or more certainly
not more affordable software tomfoolery
may just be the way it's gonna have to
be go ahead I think it might be the way
it's gonna have to be for a little while
and then we will change how we're doing
things like I mean risk five could come
along and really change the game yep
like like there could be completely
different architecture style plus that's
gonna take time yes okay III will agree
with your stance probably for like a
little while but I I think I could see
it doing that five years sure yeah I
could see that butBut I think eventually
we're gonna change how we do things and
then we'll see advancement again in in
in hardware or whatever it is at that
time cuz like the challenge here I said
if we Computing's are really cool if we
could just keep pushing clock speed
higher it would be easier to compensate
for some of the some of the trickery
that has already made its way into the
hardware products I mean you look at
what happened with Specter in meltdown
yeah anything that requires a branch
prediction for example which
dramatically accelerates the CPU I mean
if you don't have good branch prediction
in your CPU your performance basically
sucks these days and now all of a sudden
there's these exploits that are making
it so that it's becoming more
challenging to implement these features
I mean SMT there was there was a group
that came out and basically said hyper
threading is insecure we just like
shouldn't use it anymore meanwhile poor
AMD oh man
we finally got it we just added this so
it's like everyone tells you about this
party and you show up and you show up in
everyone's leaving
it's like sohbats on Intel missing the
10 nanometer node I don't think that and
I don't think people are gonna stop
needing computing devices and I think
Intel is gonna continue to be a player
in that space whether it's through
innovating their own things or acquiring
others or just marketing the heck out of
themselves again but the industry as a
whole has gotten less exciting to me
oh I'm not gonna hide it yeah and I
think that Intel is a symptom as opposed
to of the problem I hope that answer is
helpful I can't read your user name but
you said fortnight is for children war
boy please make a video we saw this PC
case in half and put it back together
with the power of flex tape no uh head
for you hi Dax
hi Johnny hi Wow Kenzi boy I need a new
phone as a viewer next birth I wouldn't
go vivo next personally I would go
something with a better camera Mikkel
says ordered your coffee should be here
in a few days you're gonna be trying it
the same time I am because I actually
haven't tried it yet really well I don't
really drink coffee well as you know
yeah and I wasn't actually in office
when they were doing all the testing of
like the different blends that they
concocted for us and stuff but we had
just about a dozen people here try it
and like it so what it what is the blend
do we know can you say well I have a
drug okay that's fair so I'll be trying
it around the same time as everyone else
and by the way don't pre-order but also
I guess pretty good think of it more
like supporting LC team less like
pre-ordering um total set hi cheers back
to Norway QWERTY asked lzx after party
Wow no idea get back to you on that one
Cameron time to fly up from Florida for
this that would be awesome it's gonna be
awesome I can't read your name because
you're Russian but what's
the Dreamhack dang it it's Dreamhack
just Google dreamer yeah
but says what exactly is going on at LTX
lots of stuff stay tuned to LAN show
we're gonna be talking about three great
Jesus says best phone for gaming GPS hot
spotting Bluetooth and chart Oh and
charging all at the same time in hot
weather without overheating I still play
pokemon go Oh No
hey hey Jake that fan module for the ROG
phone that made a pretty big difference
right yeah like what five degrees 10
degrees I remember it actually helped
and actually uh one plus we found when
we were evaluating the razer gaming
phone one plus does a great job of the
management of their CPUs power states so
can't can't recommend those guys enough
clémence says will there be free
madrenas coffee at LTX probably not but
knowing those guys maybe yeah Tommy says
bring channels super fun vac yeah you
heard Channel super fun really what is
it oh really someone's spending time
editing that mess that's a shame I don't
care I just mean that must be painful
mister Boisvert says dear ltte team
australia just passed a very problematic
bill to break encryption on any online
service I edit or realized to be very
problematic bit this is extremely
problematic what alright you have not
have you not heard about this we
probably should have covered this on the
show today it's kind of a big deal um
basically they are mandating backdoors
why I mean I don't think they're gonna
do it but if I was Google and Facebook
and Microsoft and Amazon just don't and
I neither and I knew what was and I
thought I knew what was best for my
entire in
moving forward I would completely pull
out of Austria like now let the
Australian people be super mad that they
can't reach anybody on any services that
they are accustomed to using and beat
down the doors of their elected
representatives and get this fixed the
fact that Australia is so messed up in
regards to how they deal with internet
is just insane it's it's such a mess
yeah the on visual asks if I can bring
the Backstreet Boys back to LTH oh my
god at like 4:00 in the morning we
should play it on the speakers be so
amazing
yes anonymous got a dream job hmm
want to support my favorite youtubers
sent 500 dollars Wow is that the maximum
you can send in a super chat I think so
I have no idea there is a max that's
crazy holy crap thank you thanks
anonymous we're glad to be your favorite
we're glad someone else wasn't your
favorite um Nate says Thank You Linus
and the media group I like that it's
kind of like a band the media groups
just for giving me the confidence to
build my first PC today rock on man so
does that count as having your name in
it um Wow okay all right I think that's
pretty much it thanks for watching you
guys and we'll see you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel goodbye
and we'll see you on float plane next
week yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
