been a longtime sponsor of our channel
and we use their kids for all kinds of
things from repairing phones to building
computers - I mean I'm sure someone in
this building has picked their nose with
an eye fix-it kit that doesn't
necessarily mean that an eye fix-it kit
is the be-all and end-all of tool kits
in fact some of you have suggested to us
that you can actually build your own
iFixit kit for much cheaper on
Aliexpress so that is exactly what I
tasked Anthony with this is what we're
calling the eye Foxit kit we changed one
vowel and we're gonna walk you guys
through how it compares to the brand
name iFixit kit for half the price mac
Weldon's silver line of underwear shirts
and socks are naturally antimicrobial
which means they keep you from smelling
so bad
use a fur coat tectus 22 get 20% off at
the link below
okay so let's start with what's in a
typical iFixit protec toolkit you got a
few of their astonishingly bendy like
fried tools you've got one of their
suction cups you've got an ESD wrist
strap you've got some ESD safe tweezer
like reverse tweezers you've got a
couple of little grabber tweezer doodads
you've got ah these are great so these
are their sputters so these are Price
lash poking tools you can use these to
like pop off a Wi-Fi antenna or whatever
else you've got this metal pry tool
you've got there I forget what they call
this something knife with Jimmy Jimmy
yeah Jimmy tool and then you get their
64 bit driver kit which has the
extension the driver handle and then a
whole bunch of different bits that we've
used to take apart everything from a
Nintendo DS to a computer monitor pretty
much you name it you can take it apart
with one of these and a guide on
ifixit.com but the thing is that none of
this stuff is really that unique oh I
miss the guitar picks which are
literally guitar picks except blue with
an eye fix-it logo on like you can get a
lot of this functionality elsewhere so
let's try to do just that Anthony hit me
with what you found alright well the
screwdriver kit is obviously the most
important part for what most people
would call the most important part and
this here is the it's called Alouette
the Alouette so you know what this
actually reminds me a lot of the older
iFixit kit so it's got these little
rubbery bases that all of the bits go
into like that it's got a really
different looking extension and the
driver itself is quite different from
either revision of the iFixit but feels
okay the rubberized grip is not bad
this isn't metal this is plastic so it
does feel a little less you know the
quality but is this a ratchet I can't
really tell I don't know this is
you know you wanna keep yeah ah Oh
interesting so there's a couple cool
features of this guy then now this won't
necessarily help you get into some of
the tight spaces that I've had trouble
right it's the iFixit kit because the
way to it the only way to extend this
one out of the box anyway is to take the
hex driver that's just the same size as
the as the Pitts and then you can get a
little bit of extra length now one other
thing that they actually removed that
they used to have on the old iFixit
driver is this hex hole through the top
that you can use to jam something in it
and then get a little bit more leverage
if you if you don't have enough from the
rubberized grip they removed that from
this revision and that is something that
I missed from the old one now the last
thing that I'm not that pleased with is
the variety of the bits here there's
just not nearly as many bits and some of
the really obscure ones like security
Torx a--'s are simply not present so for
those of you not familiar as security
Torx has a hollowed out middle so that
you can use it to remove security Torx
screws all right so that's our
screwdriver oh wait hold on I want to
see if there's anything else interesting
here three Torx is up here with the to
try wings and then a like a Phillips a
female Phillips with a hex on the end
that's kind of interesting so you can
use your screwdriver did something I
guess there's one pentalobe bit that I
can see the the springy thing here it
actually works at the like very extreme
angles so like you can actually do like
180 degrees here that looks like a much
smoother action there much smoother or
it's cross-compatible these use the same
diameter I believe how handy so if you
like certain components of a different
cater you just needed a top-up of bits
or whatever else yep alright so you're
saying this is by far the most expensive
part of our DIY kit how much is this
yeah it was about twelve thirteen
dollars oh that is called the Jake me I
like this and I actually like that it's
a little bit longer and doesn't taper
quite as much it feels a little more
sick
in my hand so how much is it Jake me so
Jake me costs two dollars and 42 cents
us great value recommended cordless
wrist strap be a bro wear an anti-static
strap so basically as we conduct to the
metal screw that's in the top through
the resistor we will we will dissipate
some static buildup
I really wouldn't count on this though
so the few things that I've seen that
actually test these out ya show that is
basically no different then if you're
not wearing one so the iFixit spudger
actually doesn't go quite so thin at the
tip this one's a little worn but that's
not the entire reason why it's so dull
at the end so I'm gonna pick a spot okay
got my spot and I'm gonna just bend it
back hopefully without hurting myself so
I can bend that back 90 degrees with my
hands spudger same spot not a freaking
chance like this I don't care how much
it cost I wouldn't try something with
this because I'd probably end up hurting
myself you know I'm gonna give a pass to
the screwdriver set because I think it's
a great value
it's not about fixes kit but so this is
I fix it this is the off-brand one and
in terms of strength I'd say not quite
but the blade is a little thinner and
there are times when that might have
actually been handy for me it's nice
that I get all these other options now I
don't typically like to use metal tools
for prying because you tend to leave
marks in the casing of whatever it is
you're trying to take apart but this
curved one here it's got quite a lot of
strength to it you can really get some
leverage on that depending how much this
whole kit is even if I hadn't I fix it
kit I'd probably run out and grab one of
these just for this guy and then these
are there similarly bent ones you got a
nice wide one here and then a more
pointed but but wider like really strong
tip here that you could really put some
force on I really like these extra ones
that
come with it yeah so this one cost $3.75
u.s. for those strong strong
recommendation for these ones by the way
policies so I've got the iFixit ones in
my right hand and I've got our off-brand
I fix it in my left hand here and you
can see that I fix it includes this sort
of broader tweezer that I actually find
myself using an awful lot just to pick
up a screw that I have dropped that's
non-ferrous or whatever the case may be
but really my main criticism of the
iFixit angled one is that the tip if you
try to do any real grabbing or prying
anything forceful with it they do Bend
quite easily and so that's you know
where these can really stand out to me
yeah my I fix a kid at home I ended up
breaking off the tip of the angled ones
because they're a little bit you know
less sturdy now it's not a direct
replacement for a broader grippier like
more of a grabber and I still want one
of those in my tech tool kit but I'm
liking these yeah these get a pass how
much are they a dollar eighty one heck
yeah next round let's go for these are
suction cups these are garbage okay I
actually had an off-brand suction cup I
lost my eye fix that one that's from my
kit a while back so I was using an
off-brand one to try and pull this graph
it unless you have a really good suck
you you can't apply enough force to lift
up the adhesive just for your reference
though those suction cups were a dollar
fifty five four fifty cool not even
worth it as for the rest of the stuff in
here first we've got our off-brand pry
tool now these are really really
impressive I absolutely love these I
think they're one of the highlights of I
fix its kit and this one is not now the
handle itself seems fine but there is no
way I'd be able to snap one of I fix its
pry tools Bend yes
break absolutely not these things are
fantastic and this is no substitute I
can't believe I forgot to talk about I
fix its lifetime warranty though so if
your spudger from them did this then
they'll send you a new one and that's
something that you won't get if you're
ordering random stuff off Aliexpress so
I think the conclusion then of this
video is something I wasn't really
expecting there's not a clear winner
here what we do know is that piecing
together your own electronics toolkit
could yield actually better quality than
what you get from I fix it at a similar
or even better price but the other thing
that we've discovered is that unless you
can find lots or very reputable reviews
all the things you're buying it's quite
likely that even though you're paid half
the price half of what you ordered or
more might not actually be usable or of
sufficient quality compared to what
you're getting from the name-brand
toolkit that's a real roll of the dice
okay I was sort of expecting a more
clear winner or loser but we don't have
that so hopefully you guys enjoyed the
video anyway you'll find links to where
to buy all the stuff that we feature
today in the video description but the
only ones we're really recommending are
the tweezers if you need that kind of
tweezers the screwdriver kit if you
don't need all the bits that are
included with the iFixit kit these pride
tools and the Jake me these ones I
really like these are absolutely going
in our workshop immediately today's
sponsor is mass drop featuring the new
force II dc-3 in ear monitors so these
are the big brother of absolute sounds
2017 earphone of the year they swap out
the originals single dynamic driver for
three balanced armatures in each ear
they've got a lightweight translucent
housing that shows off all the sexy
internals the new tuning is a little
more neutral but still retains a rich
sound as you can wear them at home in
the office at the gym anywhere that's
kind of the idea with in-ear monitors
they come with two removable braided
cables and you can join the drop at the
link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if you dislike this video you can hit
that button but if you liked it hit like
get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the links in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one LTT store calm and our community
forum which you should totally join we
don't have shirts like that one anymore
unfortunately unfortunately this
old-school yeah did you just pick that
up out of like the swag pile founded
them like the walk the we were hosted
something I thought you're gonna say in
the washers I I originally was going to
say the washer and I don't know why um
quick question though yes if you could
tell I fix it to copy any of this what
would you say to copy this guy for sure
a greater variety of prying tools in
general is something I think they could
improve on yep and it's not really any
better here but a better suction cup is
another thing that I'd really like to
see them improve overall though I mean
we've worked with them for a long time
that's not an accident I've been using
iFixit tools since before they were even
a sponsor and I really I like their
stuff because there's that consistency
yeah
whatever it is that I need to do I know
that the tool they've included is good
enough maybe it's not the best but it's
definitely not just complete garbage
the spotters are supposed to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
