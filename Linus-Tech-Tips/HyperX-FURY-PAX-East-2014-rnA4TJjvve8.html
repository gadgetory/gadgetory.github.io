2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair
hey guys welcome to the Kingston booth I
love checking out Kingston at these
events because they always support
eSports behind Brandon here we've got
two rows of computers of people gaming
away on everything from StarCraft a
hearthstone to I believe earlier they're
playing Street Fighter actually right
there I see people playing Street
Fighter right now so that's fantastic I
love it when these companies actually
support eSports
other than that though they have new
releases in both RAM and SSD they're
calling this the fury line is report it
was replacing reporting their old blue
line of memory which was their entrance
level before this Ram looks really good
it has a new idea on the cooler with
some speed holes and some other stuff on
it speed holes aren't actually a thing
don't worry about it but yeah they look
really sharp it comes in black white
blue and red and you can get an 8 hour
16 gigabyte configurations also one
thing before I move on it has black PCBs
a lot of you guys been asking for this
for a long time in RAM and a few
different companies have done it but it
is nice to see even more adoption for
the black PCBs because it just looks a
lot better than those old green or blue
PCBs that we've seen in the past on the
SSD side you're looking at an SSD in the
128 or 256 gigabyte editions running a
SAN force 2281 controller and this thing
is running at five hundred five hundred
for sequential read and writes so it's
not necessarily the fastest thing you've
seen before but again the fury line is
their entry-level components so this is
actually a really strong SSD at that
level alright guys thanks for watching
