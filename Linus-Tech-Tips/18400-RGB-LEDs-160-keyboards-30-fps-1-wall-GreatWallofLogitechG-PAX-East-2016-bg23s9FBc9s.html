sending us here to PAX East 2016 check
out their stuff in the links in video
description down below
alright guys we are at the Logitech
booth one of our sponsors that brought
us you this year and they don't have any
new products but I want to do a video
anyways because they have some pretty
badass stuff regardless this is a wall
of 160 keyboards which they have used
the 18,400 LEDs of which to make a pixel
wall that runs at 30fps right now it's
just playing back a video in the future
they're planning on running like old NES
games and stuff off of it it's pretty
sweet their actual keyboards you can
type on them I did ask however that I
don't see how they're going to get 160
keyboards us beat into a system so I was
like how are you actually doing this
they're all networked together with
individual IPs and work through a
network mesh to recreate the video they
couldn't use any pre-existing software
to do this because there's no proper
grid for the pixels to line up on
because as you probably know on a
keyboard your keys are on like angles
and stuff they're not in a perfect grid
so they try some pre-existing software
and ran it like 4 fps they have to write
their own stuff this wall is awesome
today here at the show if you come check
it out it's not going to playing video
games just be playing a video but maybe
it like III and other events in the
future you'll be able to play a game on
it pretty fricking cool next up is one
of my favorite things in science and
that is the blind taste test so this is
2g 900s both of which look like they are
wired into the computer one is actually
going to a wireless transmitter which
then goes into the computer and the
other one is plugged directly in and you
have to try to figure out which one it
is I love this kind of stuff because on
the G 900 video from Switzerland and the
G 900 video from back home everyone's
kind of guessing if it's actually true
is Wireless actually finally just as
fast or faster than Wired and now you
get to try it yourself because I would
be skeptical too and skepticism is a
good thing
speaking of skepticism being a good
thing if you watch my testing video from
Switzerland and didn't go I'd believe it
come down to Logitech booth try the
click latency test yourself they have a
Razer DeathAdder chroma and the G 900
lined up beside each other the chroma is
wired into the computer the G 900 is
Wireless you can try the whole click
latency setup all on your own alright
