you by Corsair their new Corsair one is
bigger badder and better than ever
before and that sponsor message was
actually at least 60% lie because the
new Corsair 1 which is actually the
subject of this video is neither bigger
nor badder it's actually good err but it
is definitely better which is kind of
the same thing as good or now I'm not a
huge fan of the naming scheme here
because they're just calling it Corsair
1 again
I actually really like George's pitch he
apparently liked Corsair doose as the
name for the follow-up but there was
some internal pushback on that so this
is what we've got but they're expanding
the lineup
there's the Corsair 1 I 144 sir 1 I 160
and Corsair one Pro I 180 an we're gonna
start with that one without making it
bigger remember they have packed 12
processing cores into this thing they've
got an RT X xx atti 32 gigs of
quad-channel memory m2 boot drive
they've got two and a half inch
expansion they've got a 750 watt power
supply and they've done all of this
while not only making it cooler so it's
able to run they claim 10 to 15 degrees
cooler on the CPU but also making it
quieter so the more efficient components
along with their completely redesigned
GPU cooler means that every component in
here with a fan has a zero rpm mode now
which is pretty freaking sick so the
only thing you would hear when you're
idling at the desktop is a tiny bit of
pump noise now there's a couple of other
changes that are more obvious from the
front they've moved the i/o down to the
bottom so you don't have the cable
weight kind of hanging off of your slots
anymore it's a little bit easier to
reach as well on your desk they have
added RGB lighting and this is across
the board for the new corsair ones and
the pro has a silver chassis I guess
designed to appeal more to the to the
workstation user so that's exactly how
they've got this thing set up because if
you're gonna have 12 processing course
you're basically into budget workstation
territory in terms of the performance
that you are putting on the table now
it's also gonna come with a high price
this guy's a 5000 US dollars but don't
worry too much about that for those of
you who are like there's other Corsair
ones for you folks there's the coarser
1i 160 so we lose for processing cores
we go down to a core I nine ninety nine
hundred K we go down to dual channel
memory though still 32 gigs of it the
specs of this thing are still pretty
through the roof including an RT X xx
atti and we drop down to a 600 watt
power supply for the so for the pure
gamers this one's gonna make a ton more
sense because you're giving up only
really workstation performance in
heavily multi-threaded applications but
you are gaining back $1,400 in your
pocket because this one is just $35.99
compared to $5000 now I do want to take
this opportunity to point out a couple
of the other changes that they made in
order to get the cooling system of this
thing to the point where not only do
they not have to run that 99 hundred K
in any kind of goofy like
low-power small form-factor mode but
even allow it to be overclocked because
remember it's a standard Mini ITX
motherboard in here one of the things
they've done is they've actually opened
up a lot more perforation
on those dual radiators that they've got
on the right and left side panels so
that means more cooling more quieter and
generally nothing better about it
whatsoever finally we've got the i-140
and the only difference is here that we
stepped down to a core i7 9700 k so it
doesn't have hyper threading compared to
the last one and we go from an RT x 2080
TI to an RT x 2080 its corsair
so it's still loaded for bear when it
comes to the solid-state storage and 32
gigs of ram or whatever but i guess
that's fine because you are gonna be
paying a cool
$3,000 even for the entry-level model so
that's it for this video in the Corsair
booth the funny thing is I think for
like this sponsored CES video I'm
actually it's actually the Corsair one
so I guess I could do a recap of the
talking points but maybe it'd be better
for me to just say hey if the Corsair
one looks pretty cool to you either in
black or silver then you should go check
out the link in the video description
because it's available already like
starting now this is not just some
vaporware announcement these things are
ready to rock so don't miss any of our
CES 2019 coverage you guys about making
sure you're subscribed Linus tech tips
and we
see you in the next suite know you're
not gonna be on follow me this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
