this time highest end motherboard for
the x79 platform this is the UD 7 this
is part a sort of part of their OC
series so in terms of color scheme in
terms of robustness this is more of a
continuation of the x58 OC then the x58
UD 7 series boards it uses their new 3d
bios which shows you an image of the
board and you click on the various parts
of the board in order to configure
things that are to do with those it has
3d power which is not three-dimensional
but rather 3-way digital power so that
is separate power delivery systems for
the CPU as well as the two different
memory zones it supports the latest
Intel Core i7 and core i7 extreme
processors on the x79
socket 20 LGA 2011 platform it supports
PCI Express gen3 Asterix Asterix depends
on the bubble black expansion and CPU I
think that basically will in the future
for channel ddr3 is supported and it
comes with a little Bluetooth 4.0 and
Wi-Fi module including which also
happens to work on other motherboards if
you buy this board and you happen to
have another system that needs Wi-Fi can
throw it in there they haven't locked
you out the way that some of their
competitors do with those little add-on
cards so thumbs up gigabyte thank you
for that adding more value alright
go see dual BIOS you can use the BIOS
selector button on the back panel in
order to pick which BIOS you want to use
at any given time OC tag allows provides
two additional onboard SATA power
connectors that provide more stable PC
at you power and three-way and four-way
configurations and also prevent
connector burn on the 24 pin I'm a big
fan of using SATA power connectors for
those because most modern power supplies
have a ton of those and not too many
molex connectors especially in you know
modular setup where you basically be
plugging in like a four-four connector
molex power plug just to plug into that
one thing so that's awesome okay we have
as many onboard buttons as I have pretty
much seen so far so you can onboard
adjust the base clock which I generally
wouldn't recommend doing on board adjust
the CPU multiplier as well as changed
gears so you can either adjust in point
one megahertz freak steps or one
megahertz steps depending on the gear
you're in you also got your onboard
power and your onboard reset switch
let's go ahead and get this baby opened
up you guys are going to discover that
contrary to what I thought and what I
thought was that the gigabyte assassin
too was going to be the highest-end
gigabyte motherboard on the x79 platform
you are going to find out that it is
rather the ud7 that is the highest end
gigabyte motherboard on the x79 platform
so there's the board itself looks Baus
if I may say so and here are all the
included accessories which are many so
we have a front panel USB three three
and a half inch thick we have nice we've
got one of those handy dandy they used
to include these with a lot of their
boards now it looks like only on the
very high end so this is awesome you got
to eSATA us you got one molex power and
then it comes with an adapter from one
molex to 2 SATA power so you can just
throw bare drives on there and these are
like the most handy cables in the world
these are eSATA 2 SATA so this is a way
to easily plug a couple bear drives into
the back of your system and transfer
data or do whatever else you need to do
very very handy it doesn't sound that
useful but it really really is okay
we've got a USB cable to power up and
transfer data to this guy right here so
this is our PCIe 1x you have Bluetooth
and wireless and adapter which also
includes a couple of antennas right
about there
we've got a gigabyte 3-way SLI bridge I
gigabyte 4 Way SLI bridge Oh which is
finally black check that out black
gigabyte SLI bridges love it love it we
have a gigabyte 2-way SLI bridge nice
flexible connector there and then
finally we have a gigabyte long
crossfire bridge as well as an IO shield
lots of accessories look at this color
coded for your satisfaction and
Happiness as well as a gigabyte sticker
a gigabyte manual and no another gig
about Dolby sticker and finally a
utility DVD and wireless card
CD or DVD DVD which you don't need
because you can download the latest off
the gigabyte website so I'm gonna go
ahead put the it back in here I'm put
that back in there I'm getting this back
in here I'll take this out of here
unbox this here see it mmm look at that
hot glue trail fascinating I wonder what
they glued to the motherboard maybe it
was slick no he says no I think he's
probably just trolling me i'ma put
random stuff on whatever line this is
gonna unbox just to throw them off the
scent okay here we go what do we got
let's start with the overall layout of
this board so this is an XL
that is to say extra-large ATX
motherboard it has seven expansion slots
which is something that is very very
difficult to do on a regular ATX AK 79
board for a couple of reasons one is the
extremely large CPU socket the other is
the extremely large and robust power
delivery systems that typically exist on
these boards due to the power-hungry
CPUs that go in them and the other is
the fact that the memory now goes on
either side of the socket as per the
Intel recommended design which gives you
a less room for slots up here and more
room for needing to put slots down here
so let's start with this socket right
here we've got a pretty beefy looking
power delivery system with a pretty
decent lookin cooler although the same
feedback that I gave with all my other
x79 board unboxings remains for this one
you are going to want to make sure you
get some decent cooling on the pwm
heatsink right here so if you have a
case that for example has a top fan
you're gonna have it blow directly down
onto this heatsink so that it's bringing
in nice fresh air to keep that cool keep
it from running into any trouble the
same thing goes for the back of the
board so your your standoffs are gonna
go right here and you'll have a little
bit of a gap so if you do have a top fan
in your case and you get a little bit of
airflow over these guys it could not
hurt matters okay we've got dual eight
pin CPU power connectors
right here in their ideal location at
the top left we've got all of our
onboard switches in their ideal
locations up here at the top right I say
ideal location because rather than
having them down here where they're
inaccessible with a graphics card
plugged in here I prefer to have them up
in this corner where I can actually
reach them no matter what the situation
we also have a Reese okay so reset so
you know what I covered all this when we
did the box but we've also got all the V
checkpoints that we could possibly want
along this edge of the board right here
so let you guys have a look if you care
you can pause the video and you can see
them all I'm not going to read them all
out on the right hand edge we've got the
24 pin power connector and it's ideal
location we have a post LED readout
we've also got our auxiliary power
connector so there's the one SATA power
connector there there's the other SATA
power connector right down there and in
terms of SATA data connectors we have
say two three six gigabit per second
right here two ports for SATA two three
gigabit per second and then for
additional gigabyte say two three six
gigabit per second so those are running
off of a third-party chipset the cooler
right here is pretty sporty lookin I'd
say it's so it has a heat pipe that runs
up to that PWM cooler the whole thing
looks pretty slick personally I'm a big
fan of green and orange and yellow and
like brightly colored but tastefully
brightly colored motherboards so not
like the old gigabyte of old we're
talking the new gigabyte with the matte
black PCB the bright orange and then
everything else pretty much black or
matte black or gray looks great front
panel connectors powered USB so like
uber powered USB for charging your
tablet with your system we've also got
two more USB 2.0 front panel headers or
front panel audio connector header dealy
then what else we got here so one two
three four five six seven right I
already covered that these support SLI
or crossfire in a two way configuration
right about here okay 16 X 16 X if you
want to run 4-way cards you're looking
at one two three four times eight X so
this is 8 X PCIe 2 or pcie 3.0 CPU
support dependent okay we've got three
PCIe 1x connectors so if you plug in two
dual slot graphics cards you're going to
be left with an 8 X + 8 X and
bearing in mind if you populate these it
will reduce the bandwidth available in
these okay moving on you know what let's
cover the locations of all of our fan
can it fan headers because it looks like
we've got a lot on this part we got one
for pin PWM here one for pin PWM here
one here that's three so far we have two
more here that's five so five six seven
oh seven PWM connectors all right on the
back of the board we have a variety of
different things we have the ps2
keyboard mouse combo port that I'm a big
fan of still seeing on boards one two
three four five six seven eight USB 2.0
ports the seamos selector are the rather
the BIOS chip selector button so you can
choose which BIOS chip you want a boot
from clear CMOS button OC button that is
OneTouch overclocking so we've tried
this with the 36:30 it's not what it's
called thirty nine thirty something hold
on I'll be back in a moment
sorry thirty nine thirty and we hit four
gigahertz just by pressing the button
and it was stable USB 3.0 times two
gigabit ethernet and 7.1 audio out
including an optical audio out and I
think that pretty much covers it I have
sort of changed my mind actually I
wanted to hold it up to it and sort of
visualize a little bit but I was going
to use the assassin to to update our
extreme buyers guide system with the x79
platform but based on the palette I
think that looks pretty good the green
and the orange based on that I like this
I think we're actually going to go with
the x79 ud7 instead now one thing that's
been kind of bugging me is I think this
XL ATX motherboard is actually not quite
as long as the assassin two this looks
like only eight PCI slots rather than
nine remember guys XL ATX is kind of a
flexible standard in that some XL utx
boards are eight slots long like this
one and some of them are nine so what
that means is that you can install this
in a much wider variety of cases then
the assassin two was capable of being
installed in so many Lee inle cases yeah
that's awesome actually
good job gigabyte so
