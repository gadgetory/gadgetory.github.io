world to the concept of the thousand
dollar MSRP graphics card with an
obscene amount of video memory six gigs
then three months after that they gave
us a slightly cut-down GPU with half as
much RAM for a much lower price now it
looks like the cycle is repeating three
months ago and video refreshed the Titan
with the new Titan X also a thousand
dollars very high performance and loaded
with vram twelve gigs this time around
and now they're giving us the gtx 980ti
a slightly cut down tight necks with
half as much vram at a much lower price
so does it impress or is it a mess let's
find out
the coarser HX 1200 eye power supply
delivers 80 plus platinum efficiency for
quiet efficient power and coarser link
digital for advanced monitoring and
control click my face to learn more so I
would tell you about the looks of the
gtx 980ti
if I thought there would be any point to
doing such a thing
it looks like every other enthusiast
great graphics card out of Nvidia in the
last couple of years for me come on you
guys at least change something I mean
RGB is cool these days Razer even made
an RGB mouse pad how about RGB lighting
on top of the card something yeah well
we'll do the tour pretty quickly then
this time around next to the green and
only green GeForce logo r2 sli fingers
on the left for up to 4 Way SLI support
and a 6 pin and 8 pin for power on the
right the card connects to your
motherboard with a backwards compatible
PCI Express 16x Gen 3 plug and to your
display with any or all three of the
DisplayPort 1.2 connectors enabling up
to 4k surround g-sync
if you're into that sort of thing or you
can slum it with DVID or hdmi 2.0 if
you're not specs wise there are no major
surprises if you watched our video on
the GTX Titan X a little while back it's
pretty much that except minus some it's
based on the same GM 200 core features
the same base and boost clock speeds at
1 gigahertz and 1075 megahertz the same
384 bit memory bus connected to the same
7 gigahertz gddr5 and the same 250 watt
TDP as its bigger blacker brother with
only the reduction in SMS from 24 to 22
so about a 10% reduction in CUDA cores
and texture units and memory from 12
gigs to a still very beefy 6 gigs to
differentiate it which is really
interesting to me I mean what purpose
exactly then did the Titan X serve at
$1000 to give gamers eager to have the
big Kepler architecture core a less than
three month head start on GM 200
performance because after gtx 780
launched you could make arguments for
the titan and the titan black that came
late
along the lines of well they're also you
know great compute cards with FP 64
double precision performance it's leaps
and bounds ahead of the gaming cards not
the case this time
and with gtx 980ti coming in at 350
dollars less then tight necks the only
reason to buy the king of the hill seems
to be bragging rights as we'll see when
we look at the performance numbers for
now let's talk tech though because as
usual Nvidia is launching some new stuff
alongside their sexy new GPU their new
VR features sound really interesting I
mean we've been stuck at 28 nanometer
chips plumbed up to gddr5 for a long
time so it takes a very different sort
of innovation to squeeze more and more
performance out of what is at a very
base level pretty darn similar
technology and that's where stuff like
third gen delta color compression comes
in to make the most of the available
memory bandwidth and seems to also have
been the inspiration alongside the very
demanding requirements like high frame
rate stereo 3d rendering and high
resolution for VR for invidious use of
multi rest shading as a way for the GPU
to render less of a frame in virtual
reality to realize anywhere from a 1.3
to 2x performance gain by effectively
not bothering with pixels that would
have been cut off in the required
fisheye conversion we hope anyway we're
still waiting for retail head-mounted
displays to verify any of that and gsync
got some updates - some of which are not
even remotely related to this graphics
card like the fact that g sync for
laptops is now official instead of some
weird leaked driver from a soos but more
on topic windowed mode works now so full
screen windowed mode gamers will be able
to take advantage of the undeniably
better experience that is variable
refresh rate gaming DirectX 12 feature
level 12.1 is another interesting one
it's not really new per se since other
maxwell cards and even AMD's tonga GPUs
will support it but we have more details
about DirectX 12 so lots of DirectX 10
or 11 cards can take advantage of the
lower CPU overhead and more bare metal
programming techniques to squeeze extra
was from the GPU we already knew this
but now we know that only card
supporting level 12.1 will get some
newer prettier rendering features all
right so with that out of the way Luke's
on a plane to Taiwan so I'm going to
talk performance today this baby was
hooked up to our usual x99 platform with
16 gigs of DDR 4 memory a core i7 59 30k
and Asus x99 deluxe and all of that and
we ran using the latest beta drivers
from both AMD and NVIDIA with a focus on
recent and/or demanding games at 4k
resolution no cards were overclocked and
there was really only one surprise here
the gtx 980ti performed just about the
same like within our margin of error as
the tight necks across the board
I had to rerun the numbers a couple of
times just to be sure but after some
tinkering I figured out what was going
on I think our 980ti whether it's thanks
to some extra power budget from the
fewer functional units or just a lucky
sample naturally boosts up its clock
speed higher than our tight necks in the
same operating environment on the same
driver in the same games as far as
overclocking goes I'm not sure where the
two will end relative to each other
maybe let me know in the comments if you
want to see an overclocked 980 TI
follow-up to this video but at stock
speed don't be fooled by the similarity
and price and product name between the
gtx 980 and the 980 TI if you're an
enthusiast who wants outstanding gaming
performance without feeling like kind of
a dumbass you're buying at least if
you're shopping on the nvidia side a gtx
970 or a 980 TI with the Titan X and the
980 left pretty much out in the cold
speaking of cold you know what's not
cold having a mobile phone service that
when you call them they actually talk to
you yes not cold no robots when you call
up ting you will speak to a person who
will help you with whatever it is you
need how much does that cost you might
ask well it's included with for every 10
customer it's not actually a special
thing and 10 customers only pay for
exactly what they're going to use
so you're going to want to try out their
calculator enter what you're paying for
your bill now enter your actual usage
and see if you could save money on
tagging slyness ENCOM and the average
ting bill is only about twenty four
dollars per month per device and there's
some extra bonuses as well if you're
stuck on contract they'll cover up to
25% of your cancellation fee up to
seventy-five bucks and if you use our
link you'll get twenty five bucks of
service credit or towards a new device
so check it out now at the link in the
video description all right so that's
pretty much it guys thanks for watching
