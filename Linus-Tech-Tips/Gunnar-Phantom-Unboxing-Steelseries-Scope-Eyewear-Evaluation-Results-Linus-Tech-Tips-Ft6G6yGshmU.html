to serve two purposes at the same time
one of the purposes is that I'm going to
unbox some kind look at this akin with a
little note on it please unbox it's from
one of my co-workers who's going to
bring be bringing in the actual Gunnar
branded I wear the ones that I'm wearing
are steel series scopes by Gunnar so
very similar and this video will also be
serving the purpose of being the
announcement of my results from using
the steel series scope I wear for two
weeks continuously not to say I was
wearing them 24/7 but to say that I was
wearing them every time I was using a
computer to evaluate whether they
actually do reduce eye fatigue and I'm
not going to tell you yet I'm going to
wait until after I've already unboxed
this particular SKU so what do we got
here this is the Gunnar phantom this is
gloss onyx it comes with the amber amb
all large small e big R lenses and it
claims many of the same advantages of
the scope ones that I'm using now so the
lens tint improves contrast for greater
accuracy and efficiency okay
lens geometry enhances detail for
sharper clearer vision okay
proprietary lens coatings help reduce
glare and improve visual focus lens
material enables precision optics for
truest image and headset compatible
temples provides long haul comfort which
I have tried by the way and does work
because the ones I have once again they
have that nice low profile thing going
on on the side of your head so it makes
it so you can wear headphones with them
so here we've got Mason neighbor Cobb
I'm not actually much into the pro gamer
scene but I'm sure he's really cool okay
inside here we find yep something about
the lens material something about the
coating something about the tints and
something about the geometry something
they haven't mentioned on the box at all
is that with at least the ones that I'm
wearing now the shape of the lens is
supposed to help reduce the amount of
moisture that evaporates away from your
eyes and if my optometrist is to be
believed and I have no reason why my
optometrist wouldn't be believed one of
the biggest causes of eye fatigue when
people are using computers is not
actually this
Green in and of itself but the fact that
they forget to blink and particularly
when you're gaming that can be a huge
issue because you're very very focused
you're looking at things for an extended
period of time and you kind of go like
this and you forget to blink and your
eyes dry out and that's really really
bad for them which is not to say that I
think that they should necessarily be
marketed as gaming glasses because I
personally didn't play a single game
while I was wearing them for the last
two weeks however and here I'll finally
give you guys the conclusion I still
declare them to be incredibly useful
because I run into much the same
situation even when I'm working on a
spreadsheet where I'm focused on this
screen and looking at that when I'm
looking at that one and I'm forgetting
to blink so they should be called
computer user glasses not necessarily
gaming glasses and I think that would
more accurately describe what they're
good for now the scopes I didn't find
particularly comfortable although I'm
getting used to them now because this
this Ridge due to the thinness of this
shape which enables the headset
compatibility is a little bit sharp on
my ears although once I adjusted the
nose piece you can see that they fit me
a lot better than they did in my
original unboxing video so let's go back
to the ones that we actually have here
today so these are the phantoms
this is the digital performance eyewear
guarantee remember oh it is guaranteed
so you actually can return them I think
it's I think it's ninety days although
don't quote me on that guys you better
double-check before you go and buy some
if you buy them directly from gunner
though you can say oh these aren't
working for me and you can return them I
suspect they have that policy because
they do work and I'm actually really
impressed my eyes are much less tired in
general I actually went out and got
prescription glasses because I thought
the reason my eyes were getting tired
was because they were working too hard
all the time and I have a very mild
prescription I went okay well maybe
that's it that wasn't it actually using
these instead of my prescription glasses
at work worked much better for me in
reducing eye fatigue oh these ones are
actually quite a bit more comfortable
than the scopes so they've got a plastic
layer on the thin metal piece here
that's a little bit smoother and a
little bit softer and they've got the ha
major league gaming little logo here and
that's kind of cool very similar overall
build so you can see the the hinges are
built in much the same way
although the lenses are a different
shape on these two slightly and then the
nose pieces are very easy to adjust
they're just on little flexible metal
pieces although these ones fit me a
little bit better out of the box and the
other ones did although they come here I
don't know if you can see this but they
come a little bit further away from my
head than the other ones do so you
should really try them out in the store
or wherever else you're shopping for
them find the ones that do fit you I can
say though if you're a graphic designer
or something like that I mean look how
yellow they are you're not can you see
that yeah you're not going to want to
use these for any kind of serious you
know color important work but if you're
working on spreadsheets you're just
browsing the web you're playing games
two thumbs out of two I think I have
only two thumbs why don't we say like
four thumbs out of two hands although
these are pinkies but you get what I
mean
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of these hands about home scale
series of the Gunnar phantom glasses and
also watching my evaluation of the
SteelSeries sculpt glasses which both
use these same yellow tinted lenses in
order to reduce eye fatigue while you
are using your computer don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos so slick totally burn me because
remember I was complaining about the
comfort that I was having with these
these come off and you can actually
replace them so that would have
definitely improved matters for myself
and I've been stubbornly wearing them
for two weeks without doing that another
thing I also didn't mention is that you
can get Gunners in prescriptions with
prescription lenses if you order them
online or there are actually
participating retailers that do that as
well and last but not least he pointed
out to me that he has seen at least a
demo at PAX although we couldn't find it
on the site that they have lenses that
are not I guess not tinted quite as
yellow as this and our four graphic
design so that the color accuracy is not
affected so while I wouldn't recommend
the amber lens for that kind of a usage
model I think everything else I said
still stands and once again don't forget
to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
