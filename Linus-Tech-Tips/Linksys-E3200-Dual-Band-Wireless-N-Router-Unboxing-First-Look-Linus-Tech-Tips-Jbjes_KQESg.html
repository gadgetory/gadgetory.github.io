high-performance dual band and router so
dual band is mostly useful in scenarios
where you have a lot of wireless
networks lying around and there's
actually oh you know what I'll be back a
minute okay guys so here I have a pretty
cool little app called Wi-Fi analyzer
this an Android app so I want to explain
why dual band is often necessary so if
there are a lot of wireless networks in
your area then you can definitely
benefit from dual band so check this out
this particular app only analyzes the
2.4 gigahertz range and you can see that
where I live there's actually only a
couple of Wi-Fi networks so you can see
these two curves are centered over
channel 6 so that means that both the
corner house 2 which is my Wi-Fi and
tell us whatever this is which is I
guess a neighbor are both running off of
channel 6 so what you can do to get away
to get the best park performance is to
take your Wi-Fi network and put it on
maybe channel 11 or 12 which will get
you away from interference and
incidentally that one's also allows some
Wi-Fi network called library so what
happens is once this starts to get
really crowded with what different Wi-Fi
networks running on the same channels
performance can be affected so that is
when it might be useful there we go to
get a dual band router so what you want
to do is you want to configure your
router then and you'll have to make sure
that you have dual band compatible
adapters and devices but you want to
configure your router to run in the five
gigahertz band so what that means is you
can remove yourself from all of that
interference that's occurring on the 2.4
gigahertz band and get the best possible
performance out of your router so
inherently 5 gigahertz does not perform
better than 2.4 gigahertz but in a
scenario let's say you live in an
apartment building or in a dense densely
populated area in a scenario where lots
of the 2.4 gigahertz band is already
taken up with other traffic you can get
away from it and you can get the true
performance that you are trying to
achieve now this is not a concurrent
dual band router
current dual-band means you can take
those both of those channels and you can
run them send and receive data on both
of them at the same time and get a
performance boost that way this is more
of like a witch which one you want to
use so 300 plus 300 megabits speed that
is on both of the available bands
superior range speed boost gigabit ports
a USB port that's very cool
to have included as well as an H it's HD
3d ready that basically means as fast
parental controls and easy setup this is
a big one because Linksys routers are
out of all of the ones that I have seen
oh hold on give me a sec guys cuz out of
all the routers that I've encountered
Linksys ones are the easiest to set up
things like parental controls and guest
networks and things like that now I made
a mistake this is a dual band concurrent
router so that means the scenario I gave
you guys where you want to get away from
interference that is still true but the
scenario I gave you guys where you want
to use both bands to send and receive
down at the same time for performance
boost that does apply to this router so
let's have a look at the back and see if
there's anything else there you go
simultaneous dual band double the
network bandwidth to avoid interference
and not to maximize throughput
throughput so that's a shorter way of
saying that long story that I gave you
okay fast data transfer rates and hence
MIMO antenna right so like all of the
recent links has products it has an
internal antenna array but it does
support multiple and multiple out that
is MIMO okay speed news plus yeah yeah
signal strength across greater distances
all of this I think we've pretty much
covered so far Gigabit Ethernet SAR
import are included this is something
that I would consider an essential
feature for any modern router because if
you are using the wired connections
which are here then you're going to want
to achieve the best speed possible out
of them and ten hundred just doesn't cut
it anymore we're getting internet plans
that are getting close to 100 megabit
per second so you want your internal
network if you're transferring large
files watching HD videos over the
network whatever the case may be to
definitely be gigabit so on the back
we've got our USB port which supports
storage so you can set up a storage
device on there for your home network as
well as for a remote access Gigabit
Ethernet ports times four as well as
your LAN port your WPS so that is your
one button one touch wireless setup your
power indicator
your 12 volt input on the sides you see
ventilation poles so these are just for
passive cooling you can actually see can
you see those heat sinks in there yeah
you can so you can see the heat sinks in
there so those are just going to be
passively cooled from air coming up
through the bottom of the unit and then
coming out of the top of it you also
have included an AC adapter one where
cable as well as the Linksys eseries
set up the CD this is one of the cases
where actually kind of do recommend
running the CD especially if you're not
experienced setting up routers it can be
kind of handy it just walks you through
and it takes you to the correct IP right
off the bat and then walks you through
the setup wizard so I think that's
pretty much it thank you for checking
