got one got one we're gonna call it 1.4
no one DNS service last year which
promised to make your internet
connection
faster and more private for free now we
already did a video talking about its
benefits and why you might want to
switch to it which you can check out
here but since we released that video
CloudFlare has launched an app that
allows you to enable one dot on ios and
android with a single button easy right
everyone should just switch to it right
well it might not be quite that simple
speaking of simple today's video is
brought to you by pulse way with pulse
way you can remotely monitor manage and
control all your Windows Mac and Linux
machines from one app create your free
account today at the link below
so as a quick refresher the domain name
system or DNS is kind of like a
phonebook for the internet so just like
when you tell your phone to call jay-z
and it looks up and dials jay-z's number
hey hey is this jay-z so yeah it's
basically like that when you enter a
website name in your browser the DNS
resolver looks up the IP address and
then connects you to the server now it's
a touch more complicated but that's all
we really need to know for now now by
default most devices use your internet
service providers DNS resolver but ISPs
have been known to collect and sell data
on their users to advertisers and in
some countries block certain IP
addresses from being accessed thankfully
there are many DNS services available
that can help you avoid those issues
with better privacy better security and
even better speed including Google's
Public DNS Open DNS and of course cloud
flares offering one done now usually in
order to change your DNS resolver you
have to go into your phone's network
settings and change it manually and
while on android 9.0 pi you can just
change it on a system-wide level and
forget about it on all previous versions
of android and on iOS you have to change
it for each and every Wi-Fi network that
you connect to
so that's the problem that CloudFlare is
trying to solve with the one app on both
Android and iOS it uses a VPN profile to
automatically direct all DNS queries
from your phone to 1.1.11 regardless of
which Wi-Fi or even cellular network
that you're connected to innovation like
well I mean actually there have been
apps to do the same thing for quite a
while like the paid DNS override app on
iOS and DNS change run Android however
using a VPN profile to change your DNS
resolver creates another problem
particularly for people who use an
actual VPN like private Internet access
so you can't have 2 VPNs enabled at once
that is not unless you want to create
like a self-destructing VPN loop that
could potentially collapse them very
structure of the space-time continuum
which means that you'll have to switch
between using the 1 dot VPN and your
actual VPN depending on whether you're
prioritizing speed or privacy now as I
mentioned if your phone is running
Android 9.0 Pi this isn't an issue and
you can follow the steps on screen to
enable one dot as your default DNS
resolver in your network settings so no
app or VPN profile is required then you
can simply toggle your VPN on and off as
you normally would but then I mean hold
on a second
why would you even need a VPN then if 1
dot makes the internet faster and
protects your privacy well about that it
does protect your privacy compared to
other DNS resolvers but one dot is not
as private or secure as a real VPN like
private Internet access
it wasn't sure if I mentioned our
sponsor private Internet access and
video are you making sure I get that in
there rather one dot is kind of like a
DNS service delivered in a VPN wrapper
so when you use it your DNS queries go
through a VPN tunnel between your PC or
phone and CloudFlare servers so no one
except CloudFlare can see those
series and then CloudFlare has committed
to only keeping data logs for 24 hours
after which they're purged unfortunately
though using one dot your ISP your cell
phone provider and the Wi-Fi network
you're connected to can still see the
sites that you visit with a true VPN
both your DNS queries and your actual
internet activity are hidden from
everyone that is except the VPN company
ok so a VPN is more private and secure
than one daughter but using a VPN
usually has a negative impact on your
internet speed as it takes a bit longer
for all that data to get routed through
an extra loop and that's how one that
makes its case CloudFlare says that
their service is faster and more private
than other DNS services across the board
because they had already built this
worldwide network of servers to provide
their other web services like DDoS
protection and while DNS pref shows that
one dot is the fastest DNS resolver on
average worldwide just remember your
mileage may vary depending on your
location and another reminder speeding
up DNS resolution does make loading web
pages feel snappier but it won't speed
up actually downloading the data of the
page so if your internet plan is just
slow or there's a lot of network
congestion or like if Cthulhu broke an
underwater fiber line again then there's
nothing one doc can do to help now let's
look at our results so here in Vancouver
BC one dot traded the top spot with Open
DNS quad nine and ad guards DNS service
with those four usually resolving in
under ten milliseconds on a google pixel
3 that is an order of magnitude faster
than some other dns providers and this
would result in a noticeable improvement
in page load times 1/100 of a second is
a lot faster than a tenth then in our
head-to-head test with two pixel threes
running on the telus network one with
one dot and one without our one dot
phone in particular when we loaded up a
site that we hadn't accessed recently or
ever before almost always came out ahead
as for our iPhone 10s Macs this one was
consistently faster with CloudFlare zap
enabled as
well compared to just a vanilla tennis
max so there you have it again your
mileage may vary but in our testing one
dot was able to improve our website
loading responsiveness and for free both
on Wi-Fi and when we were on the go so
should you use cloud flares app on your
phone sure most of the time you'll get a
snappier browsing experience whether
you're on Wi-Fi or mobile Internet and
you'll gain a little bit more privacy
while you're at it the only thing that
we'd really like to see improved here is
on Apple's side with iOS adding
system-wide private dns capability so
that we could use it in conjunction with
a VPN
but until then having to press this one
button really it doesn't seem that hard
speaking of hard how I feel whenever I
talk about internet privacy and if you
want the best
check out private Internet access VPN
PIAA hides your true IP address and
allows you to bypass geo restrictions
and censorship making you appear as
though you're connecting from somewhere
else you can use it on 5 devices at once
with a single account they've got
thousands of servers worldwide with
support for Windows Mac Android iOS
Linux and even a Chrome extension and
they've got servers in over 28 countries
and they keep no user activity logs so
