about the red iPhone like holy crap look
at all these super successful videos so
as usual we ran out and bought one
immediately to see what all the fuss was
about we ripped open the package and
what the crap is this it's the exact
same phone even the front and the
accessories are still white why are
three million people watching these
videos about this same freaking phone
what are we going to do with this phone
now if a video about the new red iPhone
model is worth three million views then
if I can make a video and what the
world's only blue iPhone I should be
able to get 10 million views now all I
need is the blue iPhone
so there is a right way to change the
color of an iPhone I looked it up you
have to gather all the tools that you
need for the job meticulously take the
phone apart be very careful when you're
painting it and then oh my god you have
to put it back together somehow oh my
god I do not have time for that luckily
this is Linus tech tips and no one
expected me to do it properly anyways so
here's my haul of super Pro ass modding
equipment that I will use to generate
that sweet sweet Adsense money ignoring
the cost of the thousand dollars for the
phone this was only about 10 bucks my
job okay let's start with play-doh I
think that's going to be the best one
this actually looks pretty freakin good
it's kind of coming along I would be
down with a case that looked like that
next up blue duct tape just do some
fine-tuning to the tape with an exacto
knife okay one little strand left so
neither of those methods actually really
works that well so we're going to go
with something a little bit less
conventional why not wax we're going to
melt some of these blue candles and see
if we can make that work
haha okay so maybe no more fire on to
the cardboard but the parts where the
wax actually stayed is not that bad
okay so the concept here is that these
toilet bowl cleaners will turn the water
in the bowl blue so maybe they can turn
the foam blue caution toxic irritant
what the doing that so for our next
experiment I thought maybe we'd try some
like you know photon transfer stuff is
it gonna work so the glue to you guys
except when you do that it's so red so
okay maybe we need to try one more thing
for our final experiment we will be
using Plasti Dip BlazBlue alright so we
have left the iPhone to dry the Plasti
Dip has settled you can see on the
outsides that it doesn't look quite as
good as in the middle where it's
absolutely like that deep royal blue the
coverage is quite solid except where if
you go to the edges and back at square
one so none of that worked I've got one
option left I can hold my breath as hard
as I possibly can and hopefully when I
turn blue so does the phone
do wait a minute I've been putting way
too much work into this if I want views
on my blue phone video and I want that
sweet sweet sponsorship money why didn't
I just use Dee brand in the first place
they have free worldwide shipping if you
spend over $20.00 and you can just go to
their shop button and configure whatever
device you want I'm going to use iPhone
right here oh thank you very much I'm
going to pick iPhone 7 and then just
select the blue true color option oh my
goodness it's even less than $10 which
is technically cheaper than what I spent
$1 amma for the supplies for this video
they are all precision cut and will
match up perfectly with your device use
dee brand.com slash blue balls now to
pick up your own and boom blue iphone
mission accomplished we did it reddit 3
million views tons of sponsorship money
ok but seriously this video was never
intended to be all about poking fun at
the hysteria every time Apple invents a
new freaking magic hue we were inspired
by the red iPhone and our love for the
color blue to talk about your balls
testicular cancer is the leading cancer
among men aged 15 to 44 but it is also
the most treatable cancer if caught
early by self-examination yes friends
were telling you to touch your soul to
help disseminate awareness about this
cause we're holding a charity eBay
auction for this actual phone this one
right here the only product red special
edition that was at one point in time
blued by linus media group on the planet
to be clear it still works just fine
it's not set up yet but yeah it actually
has almost no remnants of our
experiments on it I cleaned it myself
and it includes a bucket of blue D brand
skins in there carbon and true blue
colors so here you go this is your
chance to get something random from LPT
while simultaneously supporting two
amazing causes healthy babies you know
the whole point of the project red thing
and healthy balls we're going to donate
100% of the auction price to testicular
cancer NGO we've got them linked in the
video description and we'll post an
Instagram video of
doing it all while giving you the
nuttiest shout out we've ever unloaded
thanks for watching guys if this video
sucked you know what to do but it's
awesome because subscribe hit the like
button or even check the link of where
to buy stuff in the Amazon video
description thing also linked in the
description is our merch store where you
can buy some shirts and or check out the
community forum where you can this time
talk about balls it is allowed in that
one forum section moderators take note
people are allowed to talk about balls
on a threat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
