about yoga so I'm gonna get up on the
table here and do likes no no no none of
that none of that no no actually we're
gonna be having a look at the Lenova
lanova ananova yoga the Lenovo yoga this
is a tablet it's a notebook it's
extremely flexible and versatile that's
where they got the name I get it I
thought one of the executives wives was
really into yoga and she was all like oh
you know you should call your new
product the yoga no I get it okay okay I
got that before oh this one right here
is the yoga 11 so this is an 11 inch
Tegra 3 2 gig 64 so 2 gigs of ram 64 gig
SSD 11.6 inch touchscreen running
Windows RT so what this is meant to do
is bridge the gap between now look at
that there's an external box that's
horrible and then the one that would
look great on a retail shelf is actually
inside so let's get into the details of
this tablet notebook thing that actually
doesn't have a lot of information on
this outer box but main selling point is
the unique and patented hinge design
that makes it one of the most flexible
devices out there there's also a 13 inch
model that will be available at some
point that has a core i7 processor and
actually runs fully fledged Windows 8
but having a look at the 11 inch model
here should give you some idea of what
the form factor is capable of and the RT
model running Tegra 3 should be
significantly more power efficient
giving you much better battery life it's
also obviously more portable and you
know stuff now the thing about the 11
inch models that it's not an ultrabook
whereas the 13 inch one is so remember
to be an ultrabook you have to run an
Intel processor you have to be within a
certain form factor but either way it
should give you guys some idea what to
expect in terms of the form factor so my
biggest complaint about these
convertible
let notebook things in the past has
always been well there's so much thicker
than regular notebooks that it sort of
becomes pointless in my in my opinion so
if as long as it's something that can
fit into a regular sort of more normal
form factor than I don't mind it for
size comparison I've got an HTC 8x
because I'm not using an iPhone anymore
and so that should give you some idea
how big it is compared to a Windows
Phone which hopefully actually there is
some comparison there to be made that is
meaningful on the bottom here we've got
four rubber feet for making it not slip
around the entire construction is metal
and I'd expect that out of a product
like this that is I mean it's lenovo for
one thing so you just sort of expect it
to be extremely solidly built you can
see there's very little flex to the
chassis even though it's a thin
ultrabook and you'd expect that from
something that's meant to be used like
this where it actually has to you know
sit up against itself on the back and it
has to maintain its rigidity no matter
what you're doing so that is that is the
hinge design right there it looks like a
notebook it walks like a notebook but is
it a notebook well yes but is it just a
notebook the answer is no so it's meant
to be used a number of different ways
number one is notebook style so there
you've got a multi-touch pad
you've got a chiclet keyboard you've got
a very rugged see see little things like
this nice like rubberized textured grip
here that just feels awesome and feels
extremely durable and hopefully Slick's
getting a good shot of that you got the
texture going on there okay awesome
looks like no cardinal sins committed on
the keyboard so we have a wide back
space a wide shift we have all of our
alts and enter and controls here this
shift is a write space as well so they
haven't really changed around the format
as much as some guys do you'll find
things like an airplane mode on it
because it's running Windows RT is sort
of a tablet and I did try to power it on
and that didn't work for me so I'm gonna
go ahead and plug it in and we'll be
back in a moment
yeah you know what maybe what I should
have done is a tour of the buttons on
the yoga before I tried
it on using the windows key which
obviously won't work so this is the
power button right here as well as a
charging indicator on the other half
this is so nice it's like a rubberized
finish here that just between the
sandwiched metal just feels really good
this guy right here is the a portrait
law are the rotation lock here is USB to
SD card reader power in the power in
looks suspiciously like a you know USB
port when you look at it just like this
but it isn't and does it go in both ways
yeah look at that it's reversible that's
handy okay on the back you have the
special hinge which will show you more
close up in a moment here's a headphone
microphone jack USB HDMI which is nice
to have full size HDMI reset another
speaker and volume up and down so pretty
standard fare for a tablet but oh yeah
the screen looks the brightness is very
low right now so we'll have to show you
guys again when the brightness is higher
so that's just the way that it comes out
of the box but the screen is that has a
great viewing angle the colors don't
distort no matter which angle you're
looking at it from so these actually
serve two purposes on this notebook
number one is they act as a notebook
you know anti-slip thing the other is
they protect the top cover when you're
using it in tablet mode so this is how
its intended to be used now when you're
holding it as a tablet there's only
going to be a couple different ways that
you can hold on to it so this is rubber
I'll write again for a very good reason
let us see that's what I like about
Lenovo they think about stuff it's
rubberized so that you can hold it like
this without your finger slipping or
without not being able to hold on to it
it's also you know so that you can hold
it with one hand here comfortably with
your thumb and your palm on the edge and
the rubberized grip on the back making
it so that you actually don't just drop
the thing so let's show you the hinge
up-close so this is what it looks like
it's metal it's strong
it feels robust like when you move it
it's not like those convertibles where
they have a hinge in the middle that
rotates and then you turn the thing
around I mean what I like about that
design is that you don't have the
keyboard on the back when you're when
you're using it as a tablet but what I
like about this design is it doesn't
feel like it's going to break
in two seconds like those other ones
whether they do or don't break I don't
know I've never actually used one for an
extended period of time but it just
doesn't feel right to me
so the hinge bends here so here if you
can get in close you can see it bends
this way like that and holds itself
still until it gets to about 180 degrees
then it rotates the other way okay now
you can see it's not bending here
anymore so both of them so both of these
two hinges have 180 degree rotations but
the way that it works is very smooth so
it goes one as you fold it back one then
the other and then when you bring it
back to notebook mode it goes one back
to here where it kind of snaps into
place
well not snaps but like there's a bit of
a field will click there and then the
other until you actually close it so the
way it's meant to be used number one
notebook mode number two you can use it
in a stand mode like that so you can
actually sort of just go did it did it
the other way that it's meant to be used
is tent mode so it can obviously flip
over there we go now we got our Windows
Windows UI so yeah it didn't itself
again so let's just go settings and
brightness is oh that as bright as it
gets there must be an auto brightness
thing going on here that's adjusting it
so ah so there you go and then the last
one of course is full-on tablet mode so
that's like that so there you go that's
pretty much our hands-on with the Lenovo
yoga 11 don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips from our unboxings
reviews and other computer videos so
slick made a good point this is really
cool when you're in this mode the
keyboard is actually completely disabled
so you don't have to worry about just
touching the rubber grippy parts you can
just mash the entire back and you can
see I'll bring up the text prompt here
nothing's actually going to happen at
all I think I reduced the brightness
though somehow I
oh right I took out the power plug
however let's see so when you're in this
mode keyboard still off yeah there's our
on-screen keyboard when you're in Oh so
probably hits
probably triggered by that second hinge
so here we go let's try this okay so we
go to our search box so when we go back
there we go yep
so it's triggered by by that second
hinge so that's why it's so important
that it goes one hinge than the other
that's an extremely expensive hinge
