the verts desk now this is the first one
I've ever looked at a desk on this show
and honestly the the pitch like you're
Linus do you want to check this out it
was kind of like um I guess so until I
did a little bit more looking into it so
it would appear that this is becoming
pretty well established that's sitting
too much aside from the general
inactivity associated with sitting can
actually be a direct that may have a
direct correlation to health problems
including obesity cardiovascular disease
even people who are otherwise sort of
similar test cases things like bus
drivers so standing trolley operators
were less likely to have heart attacks
than sitting bus drivers for example
which to me was sort of bizarre but I
guess I'm not going to be the one to to
knock it before I try it
so the vert desk is an electric
automatically will not automatically
have to press a button but an electric
adjustable desk that goes from
comfortable sitting height to
comfortable standing height in about 25
seconds so the idea in holds up to 200
pounds which means all of your gear that
you'd normally have on your desk will
comfortably fit on it you can even sit
on if you don't have an aforementioned
obesity problem although I wouldn't sit
on it and a heavy computer on it all
that stuff and the idea is that instead
of sitting all day or instead of getting
a standing desk and having to stand all
day you can have some kind of a
compromise between the two that will
make you more comfortable overall so
it's available in a variety of different
options this is the black base I believe
the black base is the only base but you
can get a couple of different tops for
it so we are going to be going through
the process of assembling the bird desk
which came in three boxes for me over
the next little bit here very exciting
you
so it looks like our table did arrive in
one piece well okay like as one piece as
you'd expect a table that you have to
Excel assemble so right so there's
cardboard packing around the outside for
whatever reason this particular box was
labeled do not lay flat I can't imagine
any reason why a tabletop couldn't be
laid flat but um there you go there's
pre tapped holes on this side the bottom
side where apparently we're going to be
screwing things into at some point you
can see they're here here here here
we're not pre tapped but pre-drilled so
just that starter holes and then I want
to show you guys all the other things
that are included so we've got feet for
the bottoms of these height adjustable
feet
we've got whatever this is some screws
mega screws little plastic channel for
something okay to motor looking pieces
one of which has two plugs one of which
looks like it's for the remote motor so
I'm guessing this two goes on one side
this goes on the other side and then the
other one goes to what appears to be a
control pod where you can go up and down
using this and it plugs into the the
main control box right there alright so
then we've got two stands so two sets of
two feet with support pillars that
adjust up and down and then we have the
tabletop itself which you can get it
without the tabletop I think you save a
hundred bucks or something like that if
you look at your own table top on it and
finally we've got four pieces of metal
that presumably use something we also
have an instruction booklet which we are
definitely going to need otherwise we
would be doomed read all the
instructions prior to W blah etc etc etc
so here we go guys alright so the first
step is to take the left leg which you
can tell because of where the threaded
holes are located and the back of the
device is going to be the shorter leg
not the longer one and you take this a
small motor assembly and put two of the
machine screws which look like this if
you guys want to have a look at that in
with the included allen key so the only
thing you really need to provide from
for yourself
to assemble the vert desk is your own
Phillips head screwdriver because they
provide the allen keys that you need so
we're going to put in two of those here
just like that so the motor head faces
towards the short leg and then the other
thing we need is this hex rod here which
is going to go through the motor
assembly into the problem we want the
longer piece haha
into the table itself yeah
so to diagnose the hex rod not going all
the way into the left leg support
we're actually hooking up we're jumping
ahead of ourselves a little bit in the
vert desk assembly operation so we're
hooking the the motor up to the control
unit and what I want to do is is turn it
a little bit yeah I thought I thought it
wasn't working because it's so quiet
it's not you can't even hear it so we're
just going to try and rotate it to find
the right spot and I need that I need
that allen key back there okay it seems
to be aligned now so you can see
pressing on it is actually moving the
vert desk now so I'm going to go ahead
and stab it some more and now I think we
are actually correctly inserted so we're
going to carry on
so the next step is to put the hex rod
through the other table now what I
realized is that when we hook this one
up in order to rotate it we didn't have
to do that all you have to do is pull on
it and it will rotate to the the inside
piece no problem however once you've got
the hex rod in there it's hooked up to
this motor so they so they don't move
anymore now they're completely stuck
aligned so the next thing now is to go
ahead and screw the here we go put
screws in and attach it to the workspace
top itself now you can tell from where
the pilot holes are that the ones here
right here and about here somewhere that
are aligned for these these are the back
of the desk because there's more legroom
towards the front of the desk where
you're less likely to hit this rod the
four long wood screws go in now so one
two three four without fully tightening
them and I cannot emphasize enough the
importance of getting these lined up
right so that they're the same height
away from the hole on either side
because otherwise as far as I can tell
your table will be permanently crooked
the control switch has special screws so
these are the only screws for the
control switch they're kind of about the
length of the width of your finger and
you can mount it either on the right
side or on the left side it's totally up
to you so I think being right handed I
will go for the right side of the table
so you just align that with the pilot
holes and screw those in then you run
the cable on the inside of the control
rod of the hex rod right there so this
next piece is the cover for the hex rod
so you can put it on either way and
depending on which way you put your
switch you're going to take these
notches here and run it through the
notches there we go so that there's some
cable management going on and so that
nothing's going to interfere with the
rod itself so this is where I guess a
drill might be kind of nice because this
is going to take me a while here so
we're going to put about eight of these
screws in in order to attach this firmly
this is one of those things where you
can never quite decide is it faster to
just soldier through it or is it faster
to go get the drill so the rod cover
here we fully tightened as we went but
this next one we're not going to fully
tighten as we go
it takes three wood screws see there's a
guide holes that are in here so three
wood screws that go through it and we're
yeah we're not fully tightening any of
this stuff so I do have my drill now so
I'm just starting that for the sake of
the camera and then we take these guys
these like honking guys like this these
go into the ends actually maybe it'd be
better to do this em so you guys can see
what I'm doing so it goes into the end
here and then screws into the end of
this I guess they call it a support tube
but it's more of a square so I don't
know how exactly that works and that
screws in like that so just give some
rigidity to the table itself here
okay so we slide this plate and there's
a particular orientation for it there's
a hole here so that goes towards the
front and then what we do is we put the
screwdriver through that hole with this
one screw that came inside that box and
we hot we drop it and we put that into
this hole right here that's what
actually keeps the mounting plate in
place and keeps it from just completely
falling away from on this guy besides
just its natural edible like sex appeal
ah there we go now that will go anywhere
then we take this guy and we melt it
somewhere presumably here presumably
this way sometimes it's actually reaches
you have the option to go either way if
you what we'll figure this out and we're
tightening these guys all the way now
they want you to screw this thing in but
it's just like a wire management thing
for bringing this wire over to the
control box it comes with double sided
tape I'm inclined to sort of give it a
shot with the double sided tape and see
if it holds out but if it really doesn't
last then I guess you could always screw
it on it's not mission-critical by any
stretch of the imagination so then we
can plug this in there we go they only
aligned they only go in one way they're
keyed see there's a little thing here
that it goes in one way so there you go
and we can push those in there know that
I'd recommend like tracking it like that
next thing so now there's only one one
wire that actually goes into the wall so
all of our other wires are are managed
at this point so now we have to install
our cross support brace which is going
to sort of slide on somehow supposedly
so only a moment for that write that up
with that other allen key Co the cross
brace isn't too hard because these these
legs do rotate out so you rotate them
out then you bring the cross brace in
then you rotate them in and it's a six
allen keys at the back in order to
actually secure it in place
let's see align them with the whole of
course I move for dead
so this piece we fully tighten as we go
now they're saying the next piece to
fully tighten are these big guys that
are on the side here so we're just going
to give those the old alright ok from
either side and then that leaves us with
the last thing is to fully tighten being
the four screws that hold these pieces
to the desk itself and I understand now
why they asked you not to fully tighten
them earlier in the process because
there's a lot of shifting and settling
an adjustment that goes on while you're
attaching pieces like this that are
meant to to guide it and make sure that
everything is aligned so we're just
going to give it a quick tighten down
here 1 2 3 4 and then they are because
you guys are all so organically
conscious they make sure to tell you hey
make sure you have an assistant help you
flip the best over into its correct
position right side up so that you know
no throwing because for all the good
it's going to do you to prevent
cardiovascular disease if you break your
back moving your desk room and you're
not gonna be happy about that either so
we've got leveler eat that you can just
screw into the bottom kind of go like
this
there we go we've seen those on desks
before and we are pretty much done so
let's do a bit of a demo here with the
vert desk completely assembled and
plugged in to the wall
right so here's what someone like me
might use a desk for like this so here
I'll show you guys the full the full
range of the height adjustment is
extremely quiet so you can sit very
comfortably at it here's my chair stance
alright and then you're pressing the
button here you can raise it up to a
comfortable height where you could use
it standing up so I might use it for
things like product showcases and demos
and unboxings where some things are
small and I'm going to want to have them
right up here where I can show them -
wow this think that's really high I
guess I'm short so I'm only 5 6 so it's
a little high for me at its very highest
height but we you know if you were
actually a reasonable height of course
it you need to be able to use it as well
but I guess that's the point of organic
furniture isn't it
so german-made motor very solid feeling
actually
even if it's fall how you can see I'm
I'm heaving on it a little bit here I've
got this probably weighs a good sort of
35 40 pounds and it's not even sitting
actually here so I've been sitting on
the concrete here so they add the feet
aren't fully stabilized as well but
there you go that's the vert disc don't
forget to subscribe - technics remark
sings reviews and other computer videos
and apparently desks no we do desks now
and that gives you some idea of the
speed of the height adjustment as well
so it's about one inch per second
according to their specifications</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
