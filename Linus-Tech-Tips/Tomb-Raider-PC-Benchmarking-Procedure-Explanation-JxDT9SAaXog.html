Tomb Raider the new tomb raider not the
old tomb raider although we could do a
benchmarking guide for the old tomb
raider it would involve like how many
how many triangles per second can it
draw and the answer would be too so
basically what we're doing here is
showing you guys the run through that we
use here at Linus tech tips to figure
out which games perform better which
games which cards perform best in this
game and showing you guys exactly how
we're running the game so that way you
can try it at home you can find out how
your system stacks up against ours and
it will be hosted as usual by slick
jabbering into his blue snowball
microphone at his desk so we start off
the benchmark just by running across
these two bridges right here I just
check out the truss effects on your hair
I guess there's nothing else really
going on at this part of the game right
when we come around the corner up here
through the arches it'll go she'll start
walking and then this leads you right
into a cinematic the cinematics in this
game are done actively within the engine
they're not pre-rendered so there's no
need to worry
I take this guy out right away and then
shoot the other guy twice then dip below
the boxes and wait for him to adjust
then when he stands up next just take
them out charge up to the double doors
and then driving get their start
spamming e after a little bit of e spam
she'll get through the door once you
break in there's another short cinematic
its way for that to be over and then
she'll lead into a wooden barricade span
F against the wooden barricade right
when you get outside just head to the
right and jump over the gap follow the
trail and then she'll whip out her vote
for you hide behind the wooden cart
that's right here and then this guy will
shine a flashlight down here and just
wait for him to point it away and then
take him out as he falls run up to this
stand jump up onto the stand and pull
yourself up and then look out into the
houses that are on fire benchmark should
end once you're up here within about
three to five seconds shouldn't be that
huge of a variance due to like
cinematics and fairly canned events and
then you're good to go I hope you guys
enjoyed that the deep sensual seductive
sound of slicks voice and I certainly
did don't forget to subscribe to Linus
