light laptop manufacturers have been
getting so close to creating the perfect
laptop like Microsoft Surface laptop for
example sexy the screen is great and the
keyboard is amazing but the i/o is hot
garbage the Dell XPS 13 it's got
top-tier build quality solid i/o and is
really quick but the screen options and
the webcam placement in particular are
mediocre alright so what about the og
thin and light laptop King Apple to find
out Alex who writes our laptop reviews
these days completely switched to Apple
products giving up his pixel to and
surface laptop for the iPhone 10s and
MacBook Air which has finally been
updated for 2018 memory expresses
Victoria BC location is now open and
this new store offers all the same
product selection and quality of service
as there others check out the link below
to learn more
first impressions last a lifetime and
first impressions of the macbook air are
that well it's probably gonna have a
long lifetime this is a damn well built
machine the aluminum chassis is easily
among the stiffest on the market there's
virtually no screenflex whatsoever and
although it is thin it's denser than you
might expect when just under three
pounds compared to the last version of
the air which by the way debuted in 2013
the reduction of the bezels and the way
that the glossy black extends right to
the edge really ups the sex appeal of
this year's model and you wouldn't feel
weird taking it out of your backpack no
matter what the setting just make sure
that while you're putting it in your
backpack you remember your dongles now
to be clear I'm not too torn up about
the i/o these are both Thunderbolt 3
ports with compatibility for displays
docks external GPUs any USB device you
could want including charging the
MacBook Air itself so I would take these
over a Type A and a mini DisplayPort any
day of the week Microsoft now let's get
back to the screen it's more than just
glossy ER it addresses every problem
with the old MacBook Air design
increasing the resolution to 2560 by
1600
that's a taller 16 by 10 aspect ratio
for those keeping score at home and they
also increase the color gamut making it
among the best laptop displays available
with an asterisk I don't expect this to
make any difference in fact I suspect
that Apple gives exactly 0 FS what I
think but I'm once again disappointed
that they refuse to include touchscreen
support in their Mac OS and on their
laptops at least the touchpad is awesome
though
and boy is it ever awesome like I know
we always go on about how great Apple's
touch pads are but suck it up PC fanboys
we do it because they are there are a
bunch of gestures actually that have
been available on windows for a long
time but I've just never used them
because they don't feel right
by contrast after only a couple hours on
Mac OS they just become part of the
natural flow of using the machine they
are so well thought-out and like look
how big it is also how close it is to
the keyboard which makes it really easy
to thumb operate while you're typing
also super natural the fingerprint
sensor in the power button there is one
place that a fingerprint sensor is
better than face ID and this is it
Apple nailed it like I'm always logged
in at the same time the screen turns on
after opening this guy up touch ID is so
well implemented here that frankly it
feels almost as natural as Windows hello
facial recognition on the surface laptop
unfortunately there is one area where
the MacBook Air can't get close to the
surface laptop the keyboard now I don't
personally miss the touch bar so I'm not
gonna dock any marks there but these
short throw and potentially short life
key switches are just not a great time
to type on for extended periods like
after a while I actually can get mostly
used to them really similar to the
MacBook Pro and credit where credit is
due they are really easy to type on in
awkward situations like if you're
walking around like holding your laptop
clickety-clacking on it since you don't
have to apply a lot of force and that
short throw does make staying steady
easier but I still find myself missing
more strokes than usual and have a hard
time feeling where each key ends and
making matters worse is the lack of a
Delete key
okay well backspace says delete but it
just goes back because it's a Mac and I
know you can do function delete but man
I miss my dedicated Delete key almost as
much as my touchscreen when I go to a
Mac the part that gets me the most
though is that Apple had fantastic
laptop keyboards arguably the best in
the game and then now they felt the need
to take what is in my mind a step back
now let's take a step back and talk
about one of the things that Apple
people are always shouting about how was
Mac OS and the iPhone and the
integration that comes along with them
in short
okay the lack of Windows snap assist and
Mac OS is really annoying one time in
particular I had a video conference that
and I had to take notes and ended up
missing two slides just trying to get
all the darn Windows to each take up
like exactly half of the screen in a way
that's aesthetically pleasing it's funny
because I would always see people on Mac
books with bare windows just kind of
strewn all over the place like papers on
a desk and I just assumed they were bad
at computers but it turns out that once
you get over about 4 applications open
it can be really difficult to keep
things organized and frankly isn't worth
the effort with that said I message when
we weren't running into some kind of
random bugs is really nice to have on
the desktop it's just that as a non Mac
person like if you've made it this long
without iMessage and FaceTime for that
matter I don't really feel like it adds
a ton of value all of my friends use
whatsapp hangouts Facebook Messenger or
WeChat like I've gotten maybe 30 to 50
messages via SMS this entire calendar
year and frankly the disappointing
webcam on the MacBook Air made for a
very mediocre FaceTime experience as
well overall the best thing about mac OS
is that everything just seems to work
with no babysitting required spotlight
search can't find the camera with any of
the obvious keywords but is otherwise
awesome and if you reboot it plunks you
write down where you left off you don't
need to make sure it's not updating in
the background sucking up your battery
when you unplug all that sort of thing
like I know a lot of people in my life
that could benefit from Mac OS simply
because it's better at crap management
than Windows like I've seen people on
Windows machines that are shockingly
slow not because the hardware is bad but
because of a bunch of junk ware and kind
of putting everything in the wrong spot
where it's hard to find it whereas with
Mac OS although you don't get the same
degree of control it is harder to
totally mangle it so overall if what you
plan on doing is mostly productivity and
internet based Mac OS is just pretty
darn great the dynamic light and dark
themes and surprisingly snappy
experience given the low-power processor
stand
but then also bring me really nicely to
what doesn't stand out about the MacBook
Air 2018 it is only available with a
dual-core CPU when for course has been
the standard in ultrabooks for the last
year or so like it handled a simple
model in fusion 360 but it's at a
significant disadvantage compared to
competitors like the surface laptop -
dell XPS and lenovo x1 carbon when it
comes to multitasking and multi-threaded
workloads the good news is that the
dual-core low-power chip can be
basically silently cooled even in such a
thin device and it unsurprisingly yields
great battery life with this thing
lasting a good 10 hours while doing work
like editing this script but is it worth
the asking price well that's another
question our model here cost an
eye-watering $2,600 for an ultrabook
mind you it has 16 gigs of ram and a 1.5
terabyte SSD but even our bang for the
buck recommended config comes in at
$1,400 that's a lot but Apple kind of
sets the bar for the premium thin and
light market and with other
manufacturers creeping their pricing up
over the last few years honestly it's
it's actually not that far out there
anymore so bottom line with most of the
laptops that come through our lab we
complete the review then pawn it off to
the next new employee who needs a
computer the MacBook Air 2018 not that
kind of beast and it even hangs with the
surface laptop - and XPS 13 assuming
you're ok with the keyboard and bear in
mind of course that this is coming from
a PC guy D brand is your source for
