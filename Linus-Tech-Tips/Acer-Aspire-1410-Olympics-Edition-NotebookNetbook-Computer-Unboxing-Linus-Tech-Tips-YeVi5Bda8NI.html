from Easter I actually don't know what
is special about it except that it does
have the Olympic rings on it okay and it
is a special limited edition for the
Vancouver 2010 Olympics and since I'm
here in Vancouver obviously that's
something that's really really going on
in this city right now lots of buzz so
it has Windows 7 home premium this is
considered more like a netbook class
computer because it's got a seller on
and it's an 11.6 inch has 2 gigs of
memory a 250 gig hard drive wireless n
Bluetooth and a 6 cell battery now it's
not super powerful and that's why I
would consider it more like a netbook
but you're gonna be looking at a 6 cell
battery with a relatively low power
computer so you should get an awful lot
about re life out of it now this is an
open box model cuz I didn't really want
to open up a new one when we had an open
box one anyway but what is that what is
the model of this eyes the Aspire 1410
so let's have a look at this guy here so
there's your Olympic rings just like
that so Acer is a worldwide partner as
they are so kindly mentioned for us
there's your logo there let's have a
look at the underside of this particular
notebook okay yeah that's fine alright
so you've got the little ventilation
holes that you can see some of the
components inside I think that's our
network card and there's some RAM okay
and then your hard drive is in here so
you've got an easily replaceable hard
drive I really like to see that and yeah
actually this is labeled to RAM and
network so it looks like I was right
about what I was able to see through
there the battery slips in through the
back this is something a sirs been doing
for a long time okay and before we open
up the notebook why don't we go ahead
and have a look at what if anything is
included with it so you've got a
warranty sheet okay you've got a
passport oh this is an international
travelers warranty very good so Acer
does have an international warranty
that's very nice just for starters okay
so this is a QuickStart guide that shows
you that as soon as you open the box the
notebook and documentation will jump out
actually that's not what happens I'm
kidding it just shows you you should
take everything out of the box plug in
the battery plug it into the wall in
order to charge the battery and then
register your warranty
on registration day sir calm okay that's
great next we have an addendum
so this says please use e recovery to
recover your computer systems your
general okay great and then we find the
AC adapter which I mean this is okay
this is where you really start to be
able to tell without even turning it on
or testing anything whether a notebook
is going to draw a lot of power just a
little bit you can see this is a tiny
tiny AC adapter so we expect this
notebook to draw very little power it's
not much bigger than the ones you'd see
on a typical netbook no okay then we
have the six cell battery itself so why
don't we clip that in and I'm not
actually sure if this thing is gonna
boot up but I guess it might so we could
have a quick look at boot time if
nothing else on this quick unboxing I
could get to slide in there there we go
and lock that into place and here we go
so here is the notebook itself let's
make some room on the table so it's got
a chiclet style keyboard which a lot of
people really like and then it's got
kind of a brushed finish to the front of
it actually oh this is this is pretty
nice you can see there's actually very
little flex in the keyboard and in the
chassis itself which is I mean something
that people really take for granted
because a notebook is not all about spec
you're gonna be carrying it around
you're gonna be you know tossing it on
to the bed or you know when you get home
or whatever throwing it in a backpack
carrying it around with you whatever it
is you need to do you need it to be
pretty rugged and durable and that's
something that acer has done incredibly
well over the last few years I mean the
last thing I want to see is when I'm
using a touchpad and I press on it to
click and the whole computer go like
caves in right that's not it's not a
pleasant user experience
it looks like the battery wasn't charged
because when I turned it on it promptly
turned itself off but it has a glossy
screen here and then it also has a
webcam up at the top a microphone I'm
not answering my phone right now Oh
actually keyboard layout why don't we
just talk about that and then I can
finally call back whoever it is that is
bothering me the keys are quite large
actually I kind of like that that's
pretty neat so it's quite comfortable
for me to type on even with
um even with my relative walk a
relatively thick fingers but I do have
small hands either way and I think that
pretty much covers everything I wanted
to say about the Aspire 1410 Olympic
edition thank you for checking out my
quick unboxing on my video blog so
obviously there are some key things I
missed in this video sorry I got a
little distracted because someone kept
calling me anyway the thickness is well
under an inch which is really nice
you've got an SDHC card reader here
you've got headphones and microphone
here a couple USB ports on this side
Kensington lock and Gigabit Ethernet
okay and then I'll show you the other
side as well so I'll just kind of show
you the side view here so on the other
side you've got a VGA output which may
seem a little bit unnecessary but if
you're using this for business that is a
key feature because many people have
older projectors that you might have to
use that would use VGA here is your
power input and then you've got a little
vent for the CPU fan HDMI out much more
modern very happy to see that and one
more USB port thank you for checking out
my my video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
