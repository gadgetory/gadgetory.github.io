their costs have fallen and their
capacities are so high that they are
truly a replacement for the hard drives
of your which raises the question then
what of the heck was Intel thinking
releasing expensive 58 and 118 gigabyte
SSDs for performance enthusiasts in the
year 2018 I'm gonna level with you
we're still not sure but we're gonna
walk you through what we do know about
the Intel octane SSD 800 P after this
message from cable mod K blog Pro Series
cables use extra thick wires for a
fuller more robust look merged terminals
on the component side of each cable have
been eliminated for a cleaner build
check them out below
so just like it's smaller accelerator
siblings the opt-in 800 P comes in a
standard m dot two form factor which
allows it to work as either a normal
storage drive in any machine with nvme
or this is unofficial though in
supported systems as an accelerator for
your hard drive the caveat at this time
though is that it only does that on your
boot drive so as enthusiasts around here
anyway we would really like to see more
flexibility in the future for our
applications like booting off of an SSD
like a normal one and then using a large
octane module to accelerate maybe like a
gigantic steam library on a
high-capacity secondary drive of course
until isn't marketing the 800 P as an
accelerator anyway but that didn't stop
us from feeling like we needed to ask
what are these things for them and their
response was kind of baffling they were
like well you know we feel like 58 gigs
is big enough for a dedicated boot drive
and I mean yeah technically you could
install Windows 10 on 58 gigs but I mean
you'd have spent a hundred and thirty
dollars on a storage solution by that
point that wouldn't even have enough
additional space left over to store the
hibernation file of a high-end system
with 32 gigs of ram these days now a
hundred and eighteen gigs is obviously
quite a bit better but even then you're
gonna have to be giving me a lot of
performance to give up 3/4 of the
capacity that I would get with a decent
NAND based SATA SSD so let's go ahead
and fire it up shall we so this is it
this is the opt-in experience we are
booted off our 118 gig drive get some
benchmarks fired up here shall we
so starting with crystal disk mark at a
key depth of eight compared to a samsung
960 Pro we're getting slightly higher
random reads and then significantly
inferior random writes but at Q depth
one obtains random read performance is
over triple that's really impressive
given that this is closer to what most
average users would be experiencing in
their day-to-day lives
moving on to performance test op team
triples the speed of our Samsung and
also has significantly lower latency
eight milliseconds is a full frame delay
at 120 Hertz where our SATA SSD is over
two frames at sixty Hertz adding a Lucan
file copy in the background our op tain
drive maintains its lead but not by
quite as much moving on to Microsoft
Word our average scores put-up tay ninh
at just over a second lead in load times
with excel and powerpoint yielding
smaller gains launching from obtain
though it should be noted that every
configuration is fast enough for normal
people who don't launch ten documents at
once Google Chrome launches marginally
faster while Adobe Premiere saw just
under a second shaved off its load time
finally and this will be unsurprising if
you saw our opt-in 900p video doom the
only big game that would comfortably fit
on even our larger module was hardly
different at all okay so in spite of
using only two PCI Express Lanes versus
the four for the samsung 960 pro that we
used as our benchmark nvme drive the
octane 800 piece performances as the
kids say think on fleek so maybe the
solution then to our capacity woes is
another one let's try running them in
raid 0 alright then bippity Boppity done
now compared to a single drive the
numbers look pretty good in our
synthetic tests with only slight
regressions at a key depth of one where
raid really shines though is in the
responsiveness check
that latency and then even better check
out the max latency while we have our
file copy running that's just over one
frame at 240 Hertz set what I would
consider to be an unreasonable load on a
boot drive unfortunately though we do
see some regressions in most of our
program launch tests with the notable
exception of Adobe premier which
demonstrates what Intel's been saying
all along that obtained is not about raw
throughput but more about very low
latency which is why you won't find how
many megabytes per second it does
anywhere on the Box bringing us then
back to our original question maybe you
can help us answer it who is this for
what is it for at a hundred and thirty
bucks for fifty eight gigs and 200 for a
hundred and eighteen gigs the pricing is
not exactly competitive it's too small
for real professional work or even
mainstream consumer use and raid with
all of its trade-offs honestly isn't a
great solution because it doesn't solve
the price as for the performance I don't
knows sorry guys I mean this this is not
like the move from hard drives to SSDs
where I was ending up in like YouTube
comments shouting matches with people
who didn't get why I was so excited to
pay five X for one-fifth of the capacity
or whatever it was
octane is faster it is but the way that
intel's pitching it it's not faster in a
noticeable way at least not for
consumers the data center is a whole
other story so we've seen other
publications talk about using it as a
scratch disk in a workstation or
something like that obtained does have
higher write endurance than the NAND
flash in traditional SSDs but then in my
mind the 900p with its wider interface
and much higher capacities is the
product for that maybe with Ram price
being what it is the 800 peak who would
make sense as like a cheaper way to
expand system memory I'm not sure about
that one either it sounds like a driver
nightmare now in the future as prices
fall pull I will happily take my better
system responsiveness but for now I have
a hard time recommending paying the
extra for this particular product as a
boot drive so the conclusion then is
good technology great technology but
still looking for a reason why people
might want to buy this one let us know
in the comments if you disagree it's
making of things to disagree about the
way we integrate sponsors the
Thermaltake p90 is an open frame
tempered glass mid tower case it split
up into three compartments for your
graphics card your power supply and your
other cooling components it's got five
millimeters thick tempered glass side
panels on two sides of the case that let
you put your system on display and
provides three-way placement layouts
wall mountable horizontal laying and
vertical standing it's got seven drive
bays with modular drive trays and high
liquid cooling expandability check it
out today at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if you dislike this video you can hit

out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link below also link down there
we'll have our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one as well as our
