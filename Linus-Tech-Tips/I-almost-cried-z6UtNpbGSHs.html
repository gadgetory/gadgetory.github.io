motherboard with six graphics cards this
could be the thing that kills the entire
project the whole system restarted when
I bumped that external PCI Express cable
my level of pissed off right now is
pretty high that's not what I was
expecting
story blocks video offers you studio
quality clips at a fraction of the cost
check them out today at the link in the
video description so we found a pattern
vm2 and vm6
are not working and honestly I'm at the
point now where all I can really do is
give up on two and six in their current
configurations and we're gonna try
swapping out the graphics cards because
we finally got an error and it was
something to do with the onboard audio
controller for the graphics cards makes
no sense never seen this before in any
Pascal card especially a Founders
Edition so here's a Titan V which is a
good choice because this is what we'd
like to use for the final build anyway
because it has single slot i/o although
we have to convince Nvidia to send us
six of them and they're like this is not
a supported configuration for the Titan
V I'm like yeah I know
people are gonna know that anyway our
Quadro systems are working fine - so
we're gonna swap out our 1070 on our
Titan X which conveniently are right on
the top of the pile here with these two
puppies Oh
mmm I could do that a thousand times
that I'd never stopped dropping things
and I'd never stop wearing sandals okay
I think it's booted so it picked that up
so that's fine and six needs a GPU as
well and it picked up that one which
might be fine
Oh sound card d9 okay new update we
swapped in two new graphics cards and
then we did end up having to disable
their audio controllers which is weird
but then one of them worked so we've
actually got five lit up right now so
it's just the last one that's not firing
up so I'm wondering if maybe it's just
like my DisplayPort to HDMI cable or
something no I don't think so cuz none
locks not working on here so we're gonna
throw in our TX 2080 in here because
nothing's worked yet I really doubt it's
gonna fire up though No yeah it lit up
alright let's try the other five no I'm
not actually doing it I'm not actually
doing I want to see all of them up I
know it's normal when you're installing
display drivers for the screen to go
blank but I'm just very on edge about
this num locks not working you know I've
got to be kidding me yeah five didn't
fire up why
what is the symbolism
okay well six fired up but it's in
Windows Recovery nonsense mode yeah all
the USB devices are there and and now
it's off bastard it's trying so hard
you're just capturing my sadness over
here Thanks
so after sleeping on it
I thought maybe we need to get a little
bit back to basics here I pulled out all
the graphics cards and reran the utility
called HW Locke so something's going on
with PCI Express that's causing some
kind of nonsense in the system it was
causing HW Locke to crash and it was
causing our vm's not to load now with
our new bios which took forever to even
start posting now what we can do is
start to slowly re add hardware until we
reach a problem should be fine
NVIDIA confirmed the shipment of our six
Titan V's for this project there seems
to have been a mistake
because I never had the briefing call
where you know came up with some real
workloads to use them with you know like
realistically they were gonna support
this it school project they just dumped
the kind of little now I do want to get
in here and turn on above for GD coding
and it's weird because I've had a really
hard time getting into the BIOS ever
since I updated it like I just go
straight from this pre BIOS loading
thing to boom on raids firing up oh
there's a ps2 port maybe I shouldn't
plug into that the saga continues
it's erroring out on probably PCI
resources allocation but instead of
letting me go into the BIOS and
reconfigure that it's just hard
resetting you bastard it's funny I
remember sending a Susa memo about this
board saying this is the best behaved
dual socket board I've yet seen I'd like
to issue a retraction I mean it's not
garbage it's like really cool fancy
stuff but like I need it to work come on
just output new plan we pull out all the
GPUs again and we reconfigure the PCI 4G
decoding thing with only the onboard
connected
go just go instead of showing me this
whole bar and showing me all the post
codes it just shows me the first one
it's not working correctly
turned off
yes okay so we are on the latest bios
let's just go through here and see what
all we need to change sable the serial
port it's a few storage nope onboard LAN
disabled asus engine booster above 4g
decoding on KC I don't know what a SPM
does we don't need any of these Not
Bombs GSM I mean maybe if we just start
disabling devices that'll help this is
it
everything's reconfigured which means we
need to plug these SATA devices into the
other controller now we are going to add
graphics cards let's just throw them all
in I mean why not yellow it again that
worked out too well for us last time how
many times do you live I don't make
everything hard I mean just ask the
audience I'm sure tons of them are
flaccid right now okay so we're back to
square I don't know what Square this is
but we're back to limited
actually being able to boot on raid see
a display off of the on-board VGA and we
have all six graphics cards installed in
the system what Square is that hips
square you know like it's it to be I'm
gonna go get my laptop so here's what
we're gonna do we're gonna edit all of
our VMs to not have oh well they're gone
so that's convenient okay they don't
have their USB controllers because those
aren't plugged in so can we start them
which one's this for let's start number
four I expect this to turn on
I'm using the power of positive speech
oh crap
domain ID three is tainted this is not a
good indicator right now because if it's
the graphics cards that are our problem
we are a lot further away from this
project working than I hoped okay so it
fired up but I don't see anything here
yet which is also not a good indicator
because remember for worked before
I don't think so Oh play okay good work
David
okay starting numero six internal error
yet once again it is flipping out about
the audio crap that's bad what the hell
okay I'm really screwing this up right
now okay let's try to just prefer the
lulz device eight f00 whatever the crap
what do you mean 8f whatever what is
this okay did it change the size is that
the GPU it changed my GPU IDs oh crap so
well okay forget it we're just gonna
create a new one however much memory it
doesn't matter right now let's just get
it work in primary disk location manual
graphics card Titan V create alright
let's see if that worked oh maybe
actually yes so there it is keyboard and
mouse obviously aren't working right now
because I don't have my USB controller
plugged in but okay well let's keep
going then I guess uh oh dang it
well twos not up unless it is when I
turn the monitor back on new plan we're
gonna try two and six as the only things
plugged into the system
okay I got LS topo to run so the
difference between our new LS topo run
and the old one is now I have all six
GPUs installed in the system so what
that allows us to do if this image
viewing program wasn't completely
worthless sure good enough what this
allows us to do is figure out which GPUs
are the problem so we can see here six
is our Titan X and two is our Titan V so
then if we go into system devices this
tells us that one dat one right here and
then our Titan X those are our problem
GPUs okay so this confirms a few things
number one is it confirms that my map of
the PCI Express slots is probably right
because slot 2 and slot 3 which is where
those are one of them should be CPU 2 I
believe that slot 2 and one of them
should be CPU 1 I believe that slot 3
and actually I check that that's right
so it confirms that and it confirms why
I think 4 was fine and 6 is bad both of
them are the only subordinate devices on
a PL x bridge and those are the ones I'm
having issues with so it is my belief
that either the solution is UEFI tuning
so I've drafted an email to a Susak
splaining that these are my problems or
a new UEFI I'll remember how I started
that sentence my brain is very tired
we're I'm gonna send them an email
hopefully it'll be coherent in the
meantime though
now what I haven't been having problems
with is my UDOT to to PCI Express x4
adapters like this really is just for
testing
I intend to populate these two now
graphics card can draw up to 75 watts
through the PCI Express slot itself
so obviously this SATA to power adapter
think like look at these pin or wires on
this thing but we are not going to be
loading this thing anyway I just want to
see them work I don't need to run doom
for 24 hours straight or anything like
that alright so here goes
one and here goes to so I'm gonna put
this here so we're only getting four
lanes but that's four lanes PCIe gen3
like that's not bad does anyone else
have really mixed feelings when they you
know finally reach the end of a problem
like we're a part of them is relieved
and happy and the other part of them is
just like pissed off that it took so
long if the cringing was real last time
now it's reached the level of hyper
realism that we thought only possible in
with our TX okay
so I need this to reach in through here
yeah this seems fine so step number one
is finding out if my GPUs are even
working in those slots I mean
theoretically there's no real difference
between this and this they're just PCI
Express over a cable but you never know
titin be boom there it is and one be
zero zero this one's the same so that's
our Titan X so they're there so let's
try starting it started right away I
don't know if we have a display output
though well would you look at that not
only is it working but what's really odd
is it's running in the correct
resolution
let's see if it survives a reboot here
need I remind you guys that this is the
GPU that is plugged into an extension
plugged into a daughter board is
vertical in the case and completely
unsupported by anything like if this
works it's a small Christmas miracle Hey
are you working or what same behavior
just try to tighten B see what happens
oh oh oh okay okay obtained it's going
fast at least Wow go really fast not
slow down
and of course it's 100% complete and yet
here we are
progress bars man how are they this
broken I'm gonna see if I can reboot
that other one in the meantime
so I ran LS topo again and let's have a
look at what our topology is now
so here's those two devices
why those two specifically we're
actually moving backwards we're losing
VMs now for no longer boots I'm gonna
try three and one as well
ones up fives up threes up I don't know
if they're gonna stay up five three and
one
let's try stopping them and then we'll
try doing that's the real test and none
of them have a signal
okay okay I had really hoped these
adapters were gonna be the solution we
are going to put our GPUs in this thing
I think there's nothing that would lead
me to believe that this will be better
than using those nvme adapters yeah
alright maybe we can shut this over to
get that HDMI cable in there yep there
we go okay so that's in let's go ahead
and throw our expansion card doodad back
in here Oh ball sack which is a lot was
I think it's the bottom one that I use
why is this keyboard powered up oh these
cards have power even though they don't
have a data signal that just shut down
and reboot okay
at the pain train leaving the station
so the configurations a complete cluster
at this point the two that I'm really
worried about are the Titan X in VM
number two and the Titan V in number six
so why do we do those first alright so
they're both up but let's find out if
they're gonna stay up this has a
blinking cursor so that'll tell us if
this freezes mind you if it behaves like
before it'll probably just go away did
that just go away
oh whoa whoa this one's up I'm gonna
shut it down and reboot it is it doing a
graceful shutdown yeah okay so this is
still working I can tell cuz the system
clock is still right this one finished
its update while I wasn't looking we're
gonna rerun our command here
did we just crash oh yeah that vm's gone
we're not going hail-mary anymore
you're not going for glory so we're
gonna go back to basics and we're just
gonna start with one then we're gonna
put in two and three and four we're
gonna see where we crap out and see if
we can find a pattern here so after
sleeping on it I thought maybe we need
to get a little bit back to basics here
now what we can do is start to slowly re
add hardware until we reach a problem
the fizz the Hat this is honestly
starting to feel a little bit like a
journal that I'm keeping on it on a
desert island where I'm the only
survivor or some garbage like that like
so while the camera was off last night
we went back to unraised 6.5 dot three
just in case the newer linux kernel with
all the specter and meltdown nonsense
that's going on was was causing some
problems that was a suggestion from the
unread guys and I went down to one card
and it was working then I added a second
card and boom already flaky behavior I
don't even I don't even know if that was
one of the slots I was having trouble
with before so this is this is like a
big problem and now that I had all the
mapping information I was definitely
gpus to the correct cpu course so we
weren't having to cross between the CPUs
in order to get to the PCI Express Lanes
so that got me thinking now Ivan is a
competent PC technician but he doesn't
have experience with LGA 3647 and it
occurred to me that he was the one who
installed my CPUs so that got me
thinking what if we just have a bent pin
in the socket so it was a little piece
of debris in the socket but it seems to
be clear now all right so there's one
let's try the other one no obvious
issues I should put them in the opposite
sockets just to see if like maybe I
start having problems with like
different slots or something you know
well so much for that theory I mean you
never know when you know reseeding can
just magically solve something though so
still I'm not very helpful but you never
know so this is interesting we just got
a kernel panic again this time it's CPU
one processor ID one it is still
possible that one of my you know $10,000
CPUs is defective but I'm really leaning
towards motherboard BIOS optimizations
that are wonky at this point we're not
getting away from these hard resets so
my idea just now was do a fresh
installed to that VM and see if we can
avoid whatever devices it's trying to
install drivers for so that all it's
behaving completely normally
wouldn't that be a weird thing if it's
passed out over the copied few discs but
then getting ready know about you
computer but I've been ready for a while
here hey what's going on hi first we
have a Windows desktop on machine number
two how did this happen so this is how
it's gonna be for now we finally got
Machine 2 working we think but Windows
