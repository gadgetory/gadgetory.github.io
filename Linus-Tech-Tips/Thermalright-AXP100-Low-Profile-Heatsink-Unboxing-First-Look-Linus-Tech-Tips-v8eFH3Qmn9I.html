the a XP 100 from thermal right now you
might think of thermal right as like
beastly coolers better friggin huge and
perform like awesome and stuff like the
Silver Arrow Xtreme which we actually
took a look at in a review not that long
ago where it actually was pretty darn
close to an H 100 I in terms of the
performance that we were able to squeeze
out of this bad boy with 220 millimeter
fans installed on it so you know
immaculate production manufacturing us
what I was looking for just you know
gorgeous designs very shining very cool
looking but not everyone necessarily has
enough room for a cooler like that so
that's where the axp 100 comes in this
is a low-profile cooler but built the
way that thermal right builds cooler so
the mounting hardware alone weighs about
6 pounds and obviously I'm exaggerating
a little bit but thermal rate does such
a good job of mounting hardware look at
this stuff I mean it's built like it's
actually designed for the motherboard to
be like in a combat zone and the CPU
cooler will not come off no matter what
and I'm going to need a knife to open
this up and there are a billion little
pieces but the good news is thermal
right also does a pretty good job of
documenting where all the little pieces
go so that you shouldn't have too much
trouble I mean here's what I want you to
see more than anything else like look at
this hold down plate like look at this
thing
it's like look at this like solid metal
look how thick it is it'll do an HTC 8x
size comparison because everyone knows
how big these are there you go hilarious
right no one knows but don't worry about
it it's basically as thick as the as the
glass pieces on either side of an iPhone
4 I just know that from memory I can't
hold one up for you because I don't have
it anymore so there's a backplate again
same thing super thick piece of metal
I'm not going to dwell on this for too
long let's move along to the cooler
itself so they include what looks like
about a 90 millimeter fan probably 100
millimeter based on the name of the
product and in a military-style themed
color sort of finished so that's kind of
interesting so this will look great in
your
engine c70 or you know other kind of you
know military theme sort of build in
like if you're doing a themed build then
that could be a good thing otherwise you
could get a different 100 millimeter fan
it's totally up to you and there it is
the a XP 100 we're almost going to need
like a phone size comparison for this so
for the sake of just being a troll
here's an HTC 8x size comparison again
so there's the thickness so this is an
extremely low profile cooler that once
you go ahead and install that 100
millimeter fan on actually isn't much
taller than a stock cooler so check this
out here's an LGA 1155 stock cooler so
it's about that tall here is the a XP
100 which I can tell you just based on
looking at it how much metal is in there
I mean look at this thing will just
destroy this stock cooler in terms of
performance it's not a very dense Finn
arrangement so you can see here that
they're quite loose which is necessary
when you have a slim low profile fan
like this this is a half I think this is
probably what like 15 mils thick so it's
not as thick as a standard 25 millimeter
fan so you're not able to generate as
much pressure as easily so you need to
make sure that it's able to push air
through the cooler itself but it still
packs six heat pipes check that out
six heat pipes running off the base in a
very tight Bend up to this cooler which
is terminated with I'll check that out
nice little finishing touch little
thermal write logos on the end of each
one of the heat pipe caps it's
absolutely beautiful I mean it feels
incredibly solid which I've come to
expect again from thermal write coolers
and no way what are these are these heat
pipe we couldn't be no those can be heat
pipes they're too small
but whatever so there's two little Clips
here that sort of make it more more
rigid so I want to compare this to
something like the fantex low-profile
cooler so in terms of the actual profile
of it they're pretty similar so I think
we can all say out of a stock cooler a
competing solution and the a XP 100
which one makes the most sense for your
sort of small form-factor instalay
now I did a build in a lien lis PC qo8 I
believe is the case and I ended up using
an older silent X cooler of all things I
can tell you guys right now that I would
definitely if I could get the case open
and actually access the CPU socket
because that's how tight it is replace
it with this in a second because what's
great about a design like this is it's
much broader which is fine because as
long as it's tall enough to get past the
the RAM slots or if it doesn't go into
the know zone on the cpu design
manufacturer on the cpu design
guidelines then it's big enough that as
long as you have a power supply over top
of it you could probably actually
passively cool your cpu although don't
quote me on that you might at least need
like like a cardboard shroud you can
build one yourself that was something
that I tried to do with the one that I
have but the CPU cooler is not good
enough so there you go I I'm going to do
the obligatory finger shot on the bottom
here thermal right does such a good job
of the the manufacturing on their
problem you look at this thing remember
guys again the obligatory finger shot
does not necessarily indicate how flat
the surface is or how well the cooler
will perform but it's just the kind of
care and attention that goes into the
products in fact if I angled this just
right you could probably catch diesel in
his camera over there no he's giving you
he's giving me the head shake that
either means it's not working or don't
do it I think that pretty much covers it
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the a XP 100 from
thermal right don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and
I'm just going to try and figure out why
the heck they sent this fan because this
doesn't seem to have anything to do with
the axp 100 but there you go
it's the ty1 41 fan from thermal right
it has been unboxed as well it has a
sleeved cable and it is a 140 millimeter
fan that has a 120 millimeter clearance
on this side by the look of things and
140 millimeters on this side and uses
120 millimeter mounting holes and big
broad blades for support looks like
optimized pressure optimized fan don't
