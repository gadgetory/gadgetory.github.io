brought to you by phantom glass visit
store antim glass for the best iron
screen protectors out there as well as
HyperX so we're here in the silverstone
suite these guys gave me a really hard
time because i did not show up to their
suite last year they were like linus bro
you missed all the way cool stuff and
you should really make sure that you
come by in 2015 so i I went yeah yeah
definitely definitely I will come and I
was not disappointed so as you guys
probably know if you watch my channel I
love small form-factor machines I
actually recently checked out a lien lis
case that I really wanted to based on
the initial picture I saw really wanted
to be kind of a console killer type box
and then I sort of pointed out a bunch
of stuff that I really didn't like about
it and so summer storms kind of like
yeah just a reminder you should probably
come to our suite this looks absolutely
fantastic now there were some complaints
about the rv0 one that it was a little
bit too big but in Silverstone's defense
the RV's eo1 supports a dual 120
millimeter liquid cooling radiator and
you can actually do a custom loop in the
thing in addition to supporting two and
a half inch SSDs and three and a half
inch hard drives but some people crave
smaller and are willing to sacrifice
that stuff and for those there's the rv0
2 so in the front you've got a slimline
optical drive and really not a whole lot
else you've got a couple front USB 3 as
well as front panel audio beside behind
a little sliding door then on both sides
this is kind of wow this is the only one
in the world isn't it I will try not to
break it any further than I already have
so then on this side you find a plexi
window right here that's got ventilation
holes cut into it right above the CPU
the the CPU area of the motherboard as
well as the SFX power supply and then on
the other side well she made it this
guy's this is a very early prototype so
don't don't judge the the fit and finish
of the case based on what I'm showing
you here on the other side you've got
the actually the same panel they are
reversible so you can switch them around
if you want and this one has the
ventilation holes over the video card so
we'll start by taking this one off since
it happens to all
ready be off because I'm a genius and we
can see that this is you can actually
install up to what is this like 13
inches 11.5 inches okay well I'm not I'm
not real good with the Imperial system
so you can put up to an eleven point
five inch graphic card which it's pretty
much anything you'd want as long as its
dual slot and they've actually left an
additional bit of space in the top just
in case you have heat pipe sticking out
the top of your graphics card or you've
got these right-angled mounted PCI
Express connectors as well it's
something I might personally prefer to
see reduced in height and just kind of
push people towards reference cards but
I understand why Silverstone did it this
way because reference cards are becoming
less and less common all the time also
on the back here you see the CPU cut out
for the motherboard so you don't have to
worry about remembering to install that
first and let's go ahead and have a look
at what's on the inside so I'll just
slide this off try not to break it any
more than I already have
and the internal layout here is
extremely compact so you can see the
slimline optical you can see there's two
tooless two and a half inch drive cages
up here at the top we're using a PCI
Express it looks like yep so that's a
PCB base so that's like a hard mounted
PCI Express riser
coming out of the PCIe 16x slot on the
ITX motherboard that's mounted in here
you can fit any standard ITX board
although the zotac one they've gotten
here is a little funny it's got like
sodium memory and then the power supply
now it takes an SFX power supply but
this is a bit of a unique power supply
mount in in this way now silverstone has
a whole range of sfx power supplies with
these little you know 80 millimeter slim
fans and sometimes they can be a little
bit loud especially once they start
working harder but they've actually
developed for this additional space
above the unit here a new form factor
power supply called sfx
l so this is their 500 watt SX 500 LG
and now we get a 120 millimeter fan and
a fully modular interface on a power
supply that has the same rear footprint
as an SFX power supply it's just a
little bit deeper so for some of their
cases our v01 is another example of one
that will work with it for some cases
you will actually be able to install
these new only sort of a standard
SF XL power supplies in order to in
order to get potentially quieter cooling
as well as I guess that's probably just
about it about the only advantage
alright so now let's move on to the SG
13 in this case if there were a couple
places on the RV co2 that I kind of went
yeah you guys could have probably
squeezed another inch here another two
inches there this one that is not that
is not the case at all the entire front
of the case is mesh you've got 2 USB 3
ports as well as front panel audio the
power switches on the top and then I
can't show you guys too much from the
outside but I'll go ahead and get this
open in a minute on the back you can see
this one supports full sized ATX power
supplies you've also got the i/o cutout
for the motherboard as well as up to a
dual slot graphics card right here the
sides are all pretty much mesh so
there's your intake for your graphics
card on that side there's more mesh on
the top so that's going to I don't know
be I guess passive exhaust would be my
guess based on that the front of the
case supports a 120 or 140 millimeter
fan on this side you've got a little bit
more ventilation near the graphics card
and then let's go ahead and open this
bad boy up they did not waste as far as
I can tell pretty much a single
millimeter on this case also a very
early sample so don't judge it based on
that I can't get it apart so I'm going
to show you guys like exactly what's
going on here so you've got two two and
a half inch drive mounts on the top so
you go ahead and put a screw through the
top here and they sit on the underside
here just above the graphics card and
just to the side of the power supply
you've got another three and a half inch
drive mount on the bottom so this is got
the holes here you go ahead and mount
that on the bottom right next to the
motherboard so there's it looks like
there's almost no space it's almost
touching the motherboard right there in
the front you can see that 120
millimeter 140 millimeter mount and then
you might be looking at this going one
second if the power supply goes all the
way down to here I'm not going to have
any room for a decent CPU cooler that is
exactly why they wanted the extra space
for that 140 mm fan in the front you can
actually put an AI o liquid cooler in
here there's another little funny thing
about the front as well so there you can
see the dust filter here you can also
see a cutout in the front to allow this
case to a
cept up to a ten and a half inch
graphics card so you could feasibly put
a gtx titan black edition into a case
that has the same internal volume as the
Coolermaster elite 110 a case that's
limited to i think it's a seven and a
half inch graphics card max not a tiny
bit of wasted space and but just in case
you know you need a little bit of help
with cable management given that there's
almost no space in it they've also
updated their Strider S series so last
year they made them shorter than ever in
spite of the fully modular interface
this year they're making them even
shorter than that okay so it's not the
most exciting sounding thing in the
world but another centimeter here is
another little bit of more cable
management room you're going to have to
fit your system into this case so I
think that pretty much wraps it up for
the highlights of the Silverstone suite
here guys I do want to do a special
call-out for our sponsors phantom glass
these guys make darn good screen
protectors they're Gorilla Glass so you
have that same feel as your regular
glass on your phone they're also pretty
much impossible to apply without doing
it perfectly thanks to their nano
coating on the bottom they're also
extremely scratch resistant totally
awesome stuff stored on phantom dot
class we'll have that linked in the
video description also shout out to
hyper X we wouldn't be here without them
they've got a great YouTube channel with
lots of great gaming content these days
you guys are going to want to check that
out as well by clicking on the little
button also since you down there make
sure you click Subscribe if you haven't
already so you don't miss any of our CES
