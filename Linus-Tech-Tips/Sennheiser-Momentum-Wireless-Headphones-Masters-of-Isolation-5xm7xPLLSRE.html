just a bluetooth radio and a battery
strapped to a product that's already
enjoyed significant critical and
commercial success or is there much more
to it than that well I took it with me
on my recent trip to Asia to find out
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilize the
nvme standard providing speeds never
seen before on a consumer storage drive
click here to learn more so truthfully
while my intention was to review the
Sennheiser momentum wireless headphones
on the plane ride to Taiwan at the
beginning of my trip makes sense right
active noise-cancelling headphones on a
plane the first time I ever actually had
cause to use them was in a taxi van in
Kuala lumper an exciting ride where I
saw cows on the back of a truck drove on
the shoulder of the road in a cab for
the first time ever and my eight month
old daughter had a massive poop Splosion
in her car seat that caused her to cry
uncontrollably with nothing we could
really do about it other than tune it
out until we finally arrived at our
destination for those who don't have
kids the experience is about like this
oh but there's good news with the
momentum wireless paired to my phone
it's more like this
so the noise isolation works but
actually not necessarily in quite the
way you'd expect just like it's wired
cousin the momentum Wireless features a
closed back design so a lot of the
ambient noise is actually passively
blocked by the plastic ear cups and
dents memory foam that's around the
outside of your ears
that's what reduces the baby's crying
sound but unlike other more aggressive
solutions that I've encountered in the
past Sennheiser's active noise
cancellation system which uses I don't
know like three microphones whatever
correct me if I'm wrong I'd left that
part out of my script to measure
surrounding noise and generate its own
white noise to cancel it out only really
works on low frequency noises like the
rumble of a train or the sound of other
cars on the road now two of the major
complaints about active noise
cancellation are that it can cause a
perceived pressure sensation on the ears
and that it can alter the acoustic
performance of the headphone by
introducing its own flavor of background
noise and while I definitely detect the
pressure when momentum Wireless is
powered on I don't find it as unpleasant
as say for example Brandon's Bose QC 15s
and I cannot detect any actual white
noise sound coming out of them unless I
intentionally break the earcup seal with
my ear by looking really far to the side
for example the environment around me
just sounds quieter which in my mind
makes this headphone a commuters delight
since it blocks that constant droning
sound that you hear while leaving
important things like PA bulletins for
example uninterrupted that is unless
you've got your music turned up so loud
that it drowns those out - there's
nothing I can do
which I guess segues pretty well into
the rest of my comments on the product
now that I've spent literally half of
the video introducing it and talking
about the ANC feature it's the momentum
2.0 with a battery and a Bluetooth
module bolted to it and that's basically
the momentum 1.0 with more robust earcup
wiring thicker leather cover your
cushions that actually help with the
rock hard leather headband that for some
reason made it into the 2.0 revision and
now a folding design the look is still a
fantastic joining of classic Sennheiser
and modern design languages that should
appeal to Millennials and the more
mature audiences alike and the product
build quality is still outstanding with
the combination of plastic surprisingly
lightweight metal and leather
construction okay I left out a couple
small details obviously it weighs a bit
more since it has a battery and some
extra ports and buttons but all of this
was pretty well implemented and the
cushier ear cups compensate nicely for
the extra weight again in spite of the
armored top band the charging port
although regrettably microUSB can be
used at the same time as the optional
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
port if you wanted to run it wired or if
you're out of battery or whatever else
the power button is both easy to reach
and out of the way of accidental presses
and finally on ear music controls are
handled fairly well with play / pause
track skipping and volume control
working flawlessly on my Motorola
Android phone with my only complaint
being that Sennheiser needs to revise
the switch in the push button previous
track is three presses so a mushy
actuation point actually makes it kind
of hard to do accurately which leads us
finally to the meat and potatoes of the
headphone review how do they sound Linus
man you just go on and on about other
stuff it's like you're trying to pad
your viewing session length numbers by
teasing us with nonsense for six minutes
before you get to the good part look
you're even doing it right now okay well
I'm sorry about that frankly I didn't
put it off until the end for this one
because of just wanting to tease you
guys I did it because I don't really
feel like I have that much to say they
sound great in my usual
we'd of top 40 trash and some hybrid
classical stuff so that I can pretend
I'm working on reviewing headphones as
opposed to just listening to music I
like on high-end cans
nothing I've tried in the last year has
jumped out at me in this price range and
said hey look at me I'm a clear
competitor for both the style and sound
quality of the Sennheiser Momentum's
lord knows the urbanites didn't so I
feel like while Sennheiser probably
could have improved with the wireless
version acoustically they maintained the
status quo and tacked an extra 50 bucks
on to the price for Bluetooth and well
Wireless so that ties into the
conclusion then pretty nicely did you
hate the Momentum's from the moment you
laid eyes and/or ears on them or you
more of an IM guy when you travel like
me well then these aren't likely to
change your mind did you feel like the
Momentum's were perfect except that they
didn't fold had ear pads unlocked a
battery in a Bluetooth module would you
pay a little extra for all that stuff
well then you're the big winner because
these are for you enjoy so you know I
fix it from there tear downs of a
variety of electronic devices which you
may not know is they also have quite a
few professional grade tools to assist
you with your tear downs and or repairs
the highlight of their lineup is
definitely the Pro Tech tool kit it's
got 70 tools to assist you with any mod
malfunction or misfortune I've used it
numerous times whether it was on the
iMac my wife's phone I'm drawing a
complete blank here because that's the
kind of thing that happens when you're
on the spot but the point is it's got
alright I was able to disassemble my DS
because it has tri bling screwdriver
bits also Torx security bits all kinds
of handy dandy little stuff like that
and includes things that help you take
apart the devices without damaging them
so you know little pry tools and you
know lifters tweezers all that kind of
stuff it's ESD safe it's got an
anti-static wrist strap included so you
can keep your device to stay from
accidental shocking and it's reasonably
priced and the best thing about I fix it
oh yeah I guess they've also got all
their little other more specialized
stuff like adhesive strips to put your
iMac back together and all that stuff so
the best thing about it it's reasonably
priced as backed by lifetime war
