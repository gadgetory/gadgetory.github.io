unboxing on latest tech tips this is the
msi 990 FX AGD 80 so the title tells us
a few things it tells us this is a 990
FX motherboard it tells us it has USB 3
as I recall correctly is what that
suffix means and it is a GD 80 which
means it is part of their premium line
of boards so it has a three year
warranty in Canada Mexico and the USA it
features their military class 2 concept
which means higher quality components
for longer lifetime cooler operation and
better reliability it features full
support for AMD unlocked FX series
processors these are not yet released
but they will be supported on this board
once they are full support for AMD
crossfire x nvidia sli and windows 7
pretty much takes for granted
it features OC Genie 2 which is OneTouch
overclocking USB 3 and say the 3 6
gigabit per second on the back of the
board we see a few things here hi-c caps
with tantalum cores for 8 times longer
lifetime anticipated Superferry
chokes for 30% higher current path paths
at capacity and solid capacitors for 10
plus years of ultra long lifetime we
also have that's funny it doesn't say
anything about click BIOS on here
although I would think this particular
board support it but I have no way of
knowing for sure rather than firing it
up so here is the quick guide which
gives us a look at the oh here we go
BIOS setup no it does not feature click
BIOS I guess unless they just haven't
updated this document ok there is a
layout of the board itself showing you
where everything is and what everything
is but that's ok we're gonna show you
the board itself anyway drivers and
utilities DVD download the latest from
the MSI website multi-gpu sli video link
card I think they mean cable but that's
ok
another SLI connector and another sli
connector now mixing and matching these
connectors I am assuming you would be
able to run four-way SLI so I guess
that's what they mean for you to do
we've also got 6 SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second connectors all of them are right
angle as well as 2 molex to SATA power
adapters
next we have an internal USB 3 header to
a PCI USB 3 bracket with two ports on it
we have the unconnected to make your
front panel connectors and front USB a
little bit easier to hook up next we
have a black eye Oh she'll we have a
harddrive backup utility user guide a
quick installation guide certificate of
quality and stability shiny as well a
software application user guide and a
motherboard user guide and it looks like
based on everything in this user guide
yeah this is a standard like older style
of BIOS board although correct me if I
am wrong on that one guys
nope its foot BIOS there we go yeah we
found it so that means you can use the
mouse inside the vial so though that
looks kind of weird so it looks like an
older-style blast with a mouse cursor on
it but I don't know what they're going
for here also feature super charger so
you can charge your iPad iPhone and or
mobile phone at high speed even while
the computer is shut down very very
useful feature so let's go ahead take
the board out of the packaging and we
can have a look at it might even draw
some little conclusions I can tell you
right now GD 80 is gonna be a very
high-end board very overbuilt you can
see there's a boatload of power phases
over here to the left of the CPU socket
I'm just gonna move the military class-2
sticker here and you can also see that
that is a socket am3+ so that means that
with this bracket you can put any am-3
or am3+ compatible cpu in there that
includes the upcoming bulldozer CPUs
from AMD you can also use any a M 2 M 3
M 2 plus any am whatever CPU cooler as
long as it supports the heat output of
the CPU that you put inside all right
we've got a nice little military class
to styled PWM heatsink here we've also
got a heat sink for the chipset and
another heatsink for the other more
different chipset our 8 pin power
connectors in the top left in its ideal
location and our 24 pin power connector
is along the right-hand edge of the
board in its idea
location we've got support for a dual
channel ddr3 memory it is color-coded
for easy dual channel operation and
moving down the board we have six SATA
three six gigabit per second ports all
supported by the AMD chipset
so unlike Intel chipsets that are
currently out there all six are running
off the AMD chipset and they are all
running at SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
this is great this is the first
right-angle USB 3 front panel header
that I have seen and I like it that's a
great location for it because as great
as it is to have your front panel
headers down here where most of them
still are this is actually closer to the
front of the case and thus more
convenient here are our front panel
connectors as well as our an LED readout
so there's a post readout if you're
having any issues with the board it'll
give you an error code here that will
help you fix it here's the front powered
USB so that is the one that is good for
super charger for the iPad or any other
tablet charging them we will require
that higher powered port and there's a
regular front USB front firewire front
panel audio a little thx sticker going
on here alright let's have a look at the
PCIe layout so we have one PCIe 1x 2 to
are sorry 2 PCIe 1x 4 PCIe 16x and one
PCI but let's have a look at what these
are actually wired for if you're gonna
run in 16 X 16 X mode you are going to
want to use these two slots because
those are running at full bandwidth
these two right here are only running at
8 X mode so what that means is if you're
running 3 GPUs you're gonna want to go
this one this one this one so 8 X are
probably 16 8 8 8 16 something along
those lines would be my guess and if
you're running for GPUs it'll run 8 X 8
X 8 X 8 X two GPUs 16 X 16 X so if you
do install two graphics cards you're
gonna be left with one PCI 1 PCIe 8 X
and one PCIe 1x 4 expansion
moving along for the back of the board
we've got two dedicated ps2 ports for
keyboard and mouse respectively a clear
CMOS button optical and coaxial digital
audio out we've got 1 2 3 4 USB 2.0
ports we've also got ya sorry that was
six USB 2.0 ports right there is one of
those funky eSATA USB to combo ports
very handy fire wire port Gigabit
Ethernet USB 3.0 two of those and 7.1
audio out I want to show you guys where
the fan headers are on this particular
board here's our CPU fan header that is
a four pin pwm we've also got a three
pin here a three pin here a three pin
here a three pin right here and that is
about it
so appropriate build for something like
this would be a couple high end cards
probably somewhere in the 750 to 850
watt power supply range and a high-end
six core or 8-core processor thank you
