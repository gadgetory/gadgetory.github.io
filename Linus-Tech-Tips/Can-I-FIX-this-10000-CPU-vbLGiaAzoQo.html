to do it's more the kind of thing that
I'm being forced to do so this right
here is one of the Xeon Platinum 8180
$10,000 processors from our six
workstations one cpu project and I
dropped it I didn't realize it was
broken at the time but I knocked it off
the desk and a cursory look at it showed
me that it was probably okay and it
booted in the motherboard that is until
I realized one of the memory channels
wasn't working and the CPU had a bloomin
dent in the side of it so out of
desperation I emailed my good friend
Stephen Burke over at gamers Nexus to
ask him what to do and he said well
here's something you could try and if it
doesn't work well at least you'll get a
bunch of views on YouTube while you're
breaking it so if things go wrong today
you know who to blame
with pulse way you can remotely monitor
manage and control all your Windows Mac
and Linux machines from one app create
your free account today at the link in
the video description
but the oh there it is oh my god how am
I gonna get this out so before I show
you guys how I plan to repair this very
expensive and very damaged CPU I've got
to get my test bench prepped to even
show you guys what exactly is the
problem with it right now because the
thing does actually work at least the
last time that I tried it mostly sort of
so first we're going to need a different
motherboard we're gonna need one that
uses the LGA 3647 socket and this one
hopefully still works
someone didn't put it away properly and
there's no socket cover on it it
actually does look ok so we're gonna go
ahead and throw this on the bench and
then we will go from there one small
step that I sort of missed a little bit
here this one sure
no what's one that's right sure wait yes
good cool ok ah all right
look wait what what the hell oh crap
alright that wasn't so hard look at that
it slides right down the heatsink fins
and these two screws are what actually
put enough pressure on the CPU in the
socket to ensure that all those contact
pads are making contact with all the
pins inside so you know what we're gonna
start with just one stick in dim slot a1
and see if we can even get that to go
because I haven't tested this since the
last time I tested it let's go over here
Oh
it's attented if this doesn't do
anything there's kind of a chance we
have no video at all right now so I'm
legitimately very nervous I can't
remember where it is
well no it's like got to be on here
somewhere there it is what what all
right all right all right I get it the
working theory right now because we
can't see any physical damage on the
outside is that somewhere in here
something kind of lifted away so I
figure if I put some glue in there and
clamp it down maybe it'll stick together
well enough that it'll work again
bombs wood stone metal ceramic foam
glass and more this is this falls
squarely in the end more category so
we're gonna use this finishing nail
because we didn't find anything else
lying around we are going to kind of jam
it in there this is really stupid this
is not going to work I think the best
thing that can happen at this point is
for this video to never see the light of
day and trust me this hurts me at least
as much as it hurts you yep you guys
bought it right this is what's happening
hold on
that's just advanced no I'm good just
hold still little seek - you promise
this won't hurt a bit
okay oh boy well let's leave that for a
little bit
how long does gorilla glee want to set
one to two hours
we don't have one to two hours so we'll
give it a little bit here okay so here
we go
impossible to say if that's gonna make
any difference at least until we install
it everything we do from here on out
David is just to satisfy our own
curiosity because there's no video here
all right I'm not even gonna bother
putting the fan on the CPU because like
it's not gonna heat up if it doesn't
turn on just for fun I'm gonna pull the
CMOS battery really you don't think any
of this is gonna get me anywhere I'm
gonna try black memory slot this time
knowing fully well that this isn't going
to work I'm going to try another board
hopefully you let me down it's like that
pure optimism that's keeping me going
right now here I go again putting this
thing here now this board is not even
like close to fitting on this test bench
it's not quite as good fries this wasn't
completely just a waste of my time I
wouldn't be so frustrated right now I
don't know I mean we've come this far we
might as well put another CPU on the
other side maybe this is a dual socket
board that doesn't boot with just one
CPU I don't know
all right I give up check out the link
in the video description get 10% off
shattered hopes and dreams today after
you left I thought Jake was using this
with unread before and he might have set
it up so that the onboard video is the
default and so I went and grabbed a VGA
monitor and we posted its posted this
works I don't have to go crawling back
to Intel asking for another one to
finish six workstations one CPU I wasn't
recording audio I'm sorry no audio no
well camera is going but it's okay
everything looks normal well uh we don't
know yet because remember it already
worked at one point with five RAM
channels so I've got to load it up Jake
can I have the other RAM by any chance
thank you I don't know if I deserve a
medal or like a swift kick in the ass
it's kind of hard to get this stick in
here because of the like angle of this
what is going on like everything about
this whole setup is so jank what do you
want Colton I'm trying to find out if I
have to spend 10 grand replacing this
thing or not call somebody yeah thanks
did you try unplugging it and plugging
it back in what is it doing hurry up can
I see the post screen please
raise it it works but it only works
about the same as before so you can see
here we've got 327 gigs of ram instead
of 364 so the good news is we are booted
seemingly stabili into our OS here with
all 56 of our CPU cores detected and
well you know eleven-twelfths of our
memory also detected but the bad news is
that our attempt to fix the broken
memory channel did not in fact succeed
so hopefully if nothing else this was an
entertaining run through some of the
stuff that we would normally do behind
the scenes over here yeah so we're on
location in my garage to tell you guys
about our sponsor for today master op
master op is featuring the master
objects - an 84 X X planar magnetic
headphones so hi-fi man's been around
since 2007 and they're well known for
their affordable and great sounding
headphones in particular with planar
magnetic drivers these ones feature an
open back design with a super
comfortable build with extra soft
cushioning in the ear pads and this like
soft luxurious velour and you can check
them out at the link below to join the
drop of course mattress drop has all
kinds of stuff well it's hard to even
talk like so cold right now so thanks
for watching guys if you disliked this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should totally join on the one hand
I'm like really disappointed that it
doesn't work or any better but on the
other hand I'm glad it still works at
all
maybe let me know in the comments below
or whatever should we just go ahead with
five channel memory or should we like
pony up and get a new one I really don't
want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
