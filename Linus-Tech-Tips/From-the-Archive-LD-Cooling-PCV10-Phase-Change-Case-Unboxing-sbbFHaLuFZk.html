calling from the archive where basically
I don't know if we'll ever do this again
but like we found a video that we made a
long time ago and never released so here
it is it's not often that I do an
unboxing anymore and the reason for that
is actually a good one because you know
I think there's more value to other
parts of the experience with a review or
a build guide or a build blog or
whatever else but this product I
actually started opening it up and I
realized how fun the experience was and
I went now let's put the few things
we've taken out back in and let's just
start over
welcome to my unboxing of the LD cooling
they used to go by little devil I think
that's sort of unofficially what they're
still go as PC v10 phase-change cooled
case this puppy is going to hold your
CPU a 300 watt CPU at minus 30 degrees
gee fuel is the sugar free alternative
energy beverage to maintain focus and
endurance in long days and gaming
sessions use offer code linus at the
link in the video description to save
some money so let's open it up and have
a look at what comes inside first shall
we
you get a couple of boxes each of which
has assuming some kind of accessories or
something like that as soon as we take
out the foam on the top we've got the
top of the case that is able to house a
quad 120 millimeter radiator the OEM for
this case is Lee and Lee so you'll
probably recognize a lot of the design
elements of their PCV 10 case also in
here we get a neoprene insulation boot
that there's going to be instructions
out I seem to have misplaced the
instructions well there are instructions
for how to put on the phase change
cooler as well as some looks like
adhesive neoprene material for
insulation yes when you are cooling
below ambient temperatures you have to
insulate the cold stuff in order to keep
condensation from forming and getting
water on your hardware now I don't think
they include the kneaded eraser for most
people but they threw that in for me I'm
actually not 100% sure about that and
then the same with the PCI covers so
they sent those from you those are
actually an additional purchase this no
idea but it's a three and a half to two
and a half inch drive mount so I'm not
sure if that's normally included this
all is though this is a bunch of
mounting hardware for your phase change
cooler it's compatible with pretty much
any socket so you can see they've got
your AMD holes your Intel holes your
other more different Intel holes some
different Intel holes and then this is a
piece that goes on the back to keep the
backplate itself from frosting up and
then just dripping down the back of your
motherboard then we've got another one
of those puppies as well some more
screws and then this looks like yeah I'm
not sure I know that there's a USB
module that it includes that monitors
the temperature so that you know you
don't
boot up before it's working and
something something whatever it's in the
instructions alright so now we got to
take out these pieces of foam
honestly it's kind of a miracle that
this thing arrived in one piece because
this is pretty much the worst kind of
foam it only has about two inches of it
on either on every side so weighs about
50 pounds 50 pounds without a system in
it which means getting out of getting it
out of here is going to be a challenge
because I'm not actually 100% sure if
this applies to all systems with the
condenser and evaporator all phase
change systems like refrigerators for
example I know you shouldn't flip them
on their sides if you intend to use them
anytime in the next I don't know what it
is 48 hours or something like that so I
don't want to flip this baby over
because I want to try it out pretty
quick and I've had it sitting upright
for a while so I actually have to lift
this straight out so let's hope this
goes okay let's clear some space let's
put it up here okay it's nothing to hold
on to oh man that's heavy yeah I'm gonna
need a hand kill the camera okay got it
so I've clearly I'm clearly out of
practice at this whole unboxing thing my
wife's like why don't you just cut the
Box open like I I don't know because I
didn't think of it what's up little girl
sorry about that little Missy was
getting fussy over there so on the side
that we had actually left off on you can
see that there's a very very large
window I think there's actually a larger
window option as well but then the
bottom part is just reserved for cooling
on the back you can see we've got 10 PCI
slots single 120 millimeter fan power
supply and whoa there's already a power
plug there I guess we can start opening
it right I mean that's how this works
unboxing there we go we've got another
plug there that's for the whoo there's
our first glimpse of the phase change
cooling inside alright let's go ahead
and come around to this side where we've
got all just plain white and here we
should stay over on the side
we have light where we've got all just
plain white as well as another fan vent
there that looks like an exhaust while
they included a noctua industrial fan
these guys are serious about you know
quality here I mean I guess if you're
going to charge 1200 euros for a case
it better be nothing but the finest and
then finally that brings us around to
the front where we've got four or five
and a quarter inch base two large
intakes the USB module thing as well as
our front switches all right so let's
unveil her look at that now it's all
aluminum except for the bottom plate
which is steel to hold the weight of the
compressor unit that is installed
pre-installed in the bottom this is made
in Slovenia check that out and I guess
all that's left now is for us to open it
up and oh right no there's one thing
that we can definitely check out so
that's the thing that we heard banging
around inside the case before we were
able to open it so it's bubble wrapped
and that is the evaporator unit that is
going to sit directly on top of the CPU
cooling it and then let's go ahead and
get the bottom opened up as well so you
guys can check this out all right so
this is curious it looks like the case
comes apart completely with allen keys
like with hex heads
all right here we go left side panel off
so there's our window in spite of no
protective covering it's in pristine
condition
looks like they're using a very
different it's not glass but it seems
like a seems like a better acrylic and
then they've just got it adhered with
adhesive strips and then it is slightly
indented so it's it's just almost flush
with the side panel actually quite nice
it's a very DIY but like in a good way
in this case does seem to be a crack in
the corner though actually well there's
a crack in the corner yeah there's
definitely a crack there so this case is
available without the the whiteout
option so you can see the case is
painted white and then the actual here
we go everything but the hold-down plate
and the boot here is actually white as
well so this is the lines here are
insulated underneath this white sleeving
and then there's more insulation here
and then this piece right here is for
insulating the bottom right here so
you're actually going to have to cut
that to size you can see that nice shiny
copper base there absolutely beautiful I
mean you see a lot of DIY phase builds
on forums like Xtreme systems org or
wherever else but I've never actually
seen like a commercial grade one like
like a like a professionally done one
for for resale so that is pretty that is
pretty incredible so we can oh okay
I'll take this baby thank you so what
else we got in here so behind this plate
we've got five of Lee and Lee's usual
sort of you put rubber grommets into the
drive on either side put them down and
slide them in three and a quarter inch
base a three and a half inch bays excuse
me we've got those four or five and a
quarter inch bays up here I don't see
any dedicated s
steam mounting although it seems like if
you've got even remotely creative at all
you could drill a hole here or there put
some double sided velcro here or there
and make SSDs happen pretty much all
over the place we got a nice big cutout
for CPU coolers like say for example
this one getting those mounted with the
motherboard installed have kinda this is
kind of funny even though they sent me
the five pack of PCI covers it didn't
even occur to me at the time that I was
ordering that I have ten of these and
I'm not putting in two graphics cards
and something else so I'm probably going
to have to figure out another solution
for that anyway this is an extremely
roomy chassis so you can see that an ATX
motherboards only going to go up to here
with like mounting holes going like way
the heck off to who knows what the heck
you can put pretty much well absolutely
whatever you want and here you can mount
a 140 millimeter fan between the
basement and the no you can't that oh
that's weird so you could yes you could
screw through this side and mount a fan
on this side blowing up at a graphics
card or something like that but actually
that's going to be for your power supply
if you wanted to have it have that Happ
top intake or something for some reason
so let's go ahead and open up the
basement and get a better look at the
compressor alright here we go last screw
and there it is all that Noctua okay so
I'm not a phase change expert by any
stretch of the imagination the closest
I've ever been to anything like this was
the one time I did sub-zero cooling and
that was with chilled liquids so I
bought a window AC unit and then
basically submerged the the evaporator
in liquid and then pumped that liquid
around to my CPU and I believe my GPU at
the time don't let me just EP anyway the
point is this is a totally other ball of
wax so the evapo disappear
we know this so this is all insulated
very nicely very professionally glued
together liquidy bloop this is the
condenser so this is where the okay so
the liquid basically boils on the CPU
then it gets brought back around
then this is where it has to go from a
vapor back to a liquid so this is the
condenser so that's a 140 millimeter fan
on there that is pressure optimized fan
manufacturer does recommend cleaning out
the front very frequently because this
is going to do all the cooling this is
what does all the cooling so then once
it turns back into a liquid it comes
back over here and then around and 50
boop around and around we go so this is
that USB control board that I was
talking about before so this is where
we've got it looks like a K type temp
probe that goes presumably right up to
the evaporator head so that's going to
tell it how cold things are running and
going to tell all these other things
what to do and then over here we've just
got general ventilation for all this
down here now I don't know much about
the individual models but I do know that
Danfoss is well regarded as far as
compact compressors go this is what it's
going to make a bulk of the noise of
this system it should be noted that
phase change cooling especially a
compact unit like this like I mean I was
using a window mounted AC unit in order
to get similar CPU temps actually not
even as good whereas this has this tiny
little condenser like one-sixth the size
this tiny little evaporator this tiny
little compressor so it tries to make
everything really compact so you're
going to have to make some compromises
and noise is definitely one of them
speaking of which ting the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and satisfaction first which
shouldn't be unusual but it really feels
like it is and the one key difference
will not be one but one key difference
is that when you call them you do not
speak to a robot you actually get put
through directly to a person I mean sure
the person says press one for billing
press 2 for sales no I'm just kidding
they don't say that at all they just
pick up and they're like Hello like your
mind is so blown you forget what you
were calling them about but it's ok you
can call them back and talk to them
again once you've recovered the other
great thing about ting is that they've
got to pay only for what you use type of
plan so the average ting bill is
actually only $24 per month per device
so all you got to do is head over to
Linus ENCOM which we've got linked in
the video description and try out the
savings calculator if you enter your
last few bills and how much your actual
usage was and it turns out that you will
save money with ping they'll actually
cover 25% of your cancellation fee in
your existing contract up to 75 bucks
and if you use our link you'll get $25
in service credit or towards a new
device so check it out over at Linus
ENCOM mommy's little sunshine here is
getting kind of grumpy so thank you guys

definitely the coolest thing that I feel
like for me
I've unboxing quite sometime like the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it stunk leave a comment at one
of the places linked in the video
description either the forum or just
under the video if you have feelings
that are more complicated than this also
linked in the video description we have
a place you can buy cool t-shirts with
Linus tech tips logos on them you can
give us some of the contribution if you
like the work we do and you think it's
important and you can change your amazon
bookmark to one with our affiliate code
