laptop for some reason razor went and
put a touchscreen under their touchpad
like six years ago moved it off to the
right
Apple took away the function keys on
their professional notebooks and replace
them with the much-maligned touch bar
like here's the thing guys if it ain't
broke don't freakin fix it is what I
would have said before today right here
in front of me is the Asus Zenbook duo
and Zen book Pro duo and I think these
might make me eat my words because this
appears to be far more than just another
stupid gimmick and this video is brought
to you by I fix it the I fix it magnetic
project not helps you keep track of all
the little screws and pieces when you're
working on a project go check it out at
the link in the video description it has
saved my bacon many many times so let's
jump right into it with the Zen Book Pro
duo it comes with this wrist rest it's
got kind of a little magnetic thing
that's gonna help align it but there's
there's no actual functionality here
other than improving the ergonomics
because Asus knows from their experience
with their gaming lineup that moving the
keyboard down does tend to have a bit of
a detrimental impact on economics now
what they also learned from their
Zephyrus lineup of gaming laptops is
that a surefire way to pack more
performance into a notebook is to lift
it up off the table a little bit so that
gives us a slight angle here in terms of
our economics and also more room for the
laptop to breathe so they're calling
this their ergo lift hinge or something
like that
and essentially what it does is it
allows them to pack an eight-core HK
series processor and an RT X 2060 into a
shockingly compact little device here in
terms of i/o we've got Thunderbolt three
microphone headphone full-sized USB a
then we've got HDMI another USB a and
more ventilation as well as a power in
over here that is a freaking lot of
performance and they say that unlike the
original Zenbook pro they are not going
to be experiencing any thermal
slow down so I'm going to hold them to
that now let's go ahead and talk about
the star of the show here which is the
secondary 4k but to be clear not Ultra
HD because it's actually 38 40 by 1100
pixels secondary display so the way that
it works
unlike previous implementations where
we've relied on kind of janky software
is it just another display in Windows
that's right below your main one so if
you want to move the tab in between them
all you do is grab your touchpad and
boom drag a window it is actually that
simple
so the multitasking potential for this
is absolutely incredible and they have
actually built some software tools
specifically for it that honestly
allowed to do some pretty cool stuff so
over here on the left hand side they've
got a little thing that you can either
touch with your finger or activate with
the mouse that allows you to set up a
few of your presets so let's say I
wanted to book a trip for example I
could have my hotel website up on the
top my calendar and a Maps application
on the bottom and who knows I might want
to throw a calculator down there to see
how much this whole thing's gonna cost
me or if I'm more of a creative type I
can fire up my creation software on my
main screen browse for files on the
bottom left here and then control my
music over on the right hand side and
managing windows down here is actually
surprisingly easy so you can either have
it be a full window down at the bottom
you can have two side by side and it
works exactly the same way as your
traditional Aero snap so you just pull
it over on to the side and beep D pop
key there you go there's a different one
over there or a suits built a custom
thing where you can drag it up to a
little bar on the top and you can have
three things down on the bottom if you
decide okay you know what really I'd
rather focus on YouTube right now all
you do is hit this button right here and
boom my youtube and my musics up here
and now I am browsing the web down here
honestly as a writer I could see myself
using this all the freaking time because
now I'm having the typewriter experience
down here I've got what I'm working on
right below me and then up here I can
have whatever you know article or like
reviewers guide or whatever it is that
I'm referencing because honestly I don't
need to see that much of a document that
I'm working on now one thing I haven't
mentioned from a usability standpoint is
oh yeah that right hand side touchpad
that I have not been a fan of in the
past but honestly for the extra
productivity that I'm gonna get out of
this screen I could overlook that with
one small improvement I'd like to see a
couple of the keys over here be able to
be rebound to left and right click so
that I can operate it two-handed then I
just honestly don't see a reason why
this can't be my next notebook I
certainly hope it could be now one thing
that's not finalized is the panel
technology the one I'm looking at right
now is a 4k OLED up here and it's a
glossy display and then it's that 38 40
by 1100 LCD with a matte display down
here that's to give you a better feel on
your stylus and prevent reflections from
the top display from interfering with
the image but it could be that depending
on the region you're gonna end up with
an implementation on the pro that's more
like this Zen book duo sample so here
we've had the display downgraded to
1080p but something you might have
noticed especially if I were to open up
here we go a web page that I can scroll
through here is that they match a lot
better so in this case not only are they
both matte but they're both LCD so that
a you're gonna have a much cleaner
experience as you scroll through a page
like this look at that isn't that
freakin cool and be a su says that on
the pro model in some regions they're
aiming for LCD because they can achieve
better Delta ease for content creators
and they really want people to be able
to get real work done on these things as
opposed to just watch youtube videos and
browse the news so this one is a smaller
screen it's a lower end processor up to
core i7 what was it you series so that's
up to a quad core it's got a little bit
less i/o but it does get significantly
better Portability and it still has
dedicated graphics with a geforce MX 250
in it so I want to hear from you guys
cuz last year
PTX we showed their dual screen notebook
concept and my big thing was like guys
you're never getting rid of the keyboard
but this this I could get behind
speaking of things I could get behind
this segue to our sponsor the mass drop
plus universal IMS were tuned by drop
comm from the ground up and the goal was
to capture the technicalities of a
professional audio monitor in an I am
they've got three sunny and balanced
armature drivers per ear and each unit
is handmade with big layered and
impactful vented bass so check them out
at the link in the video description at
drop comm so thanks for watching guys if
you dislike this video you can hit that
button I guess but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured in not about four to five
months or something like that we're not
sure exactly but it's coming later and
I'm certainly stoked on it also down
there's our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
