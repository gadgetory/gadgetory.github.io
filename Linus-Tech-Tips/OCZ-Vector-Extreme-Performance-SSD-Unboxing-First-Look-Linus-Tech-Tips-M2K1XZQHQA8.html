the ocz vector which has one of the
cleanest shrink wraps I've ever seen
it's really hard to get a handle on this
I mean I maybe this is part of their
whole like restructuring they've gone
through I don't know if you guys have
been paying attention to the to the
stock news and all that kind of stuff
but ocz went through a huge
restructuring CEO is gone replaced by
replaced by another guy and they laid
off a significant portion of their
workforce with the idea being that
they're going to get leaner and meaner
and more focused on you know behaving
like the very large company that they
have now become so the vector is the
longest development cycle that we've
ever seen from an ocz SSD it took longer
than 18 months to bring to market which
means that they were I mean think about
that for a second that means back when
you know vertex 3 was riding high they
were already working on this in addition
to having vertex 4 in the pipeline and
this is the true next generation
replacement to anything that we've seen
over the last little while from ocz this
has just taken a very long time to bring
to market for context previous ocz
products have taken less than 12 months
to actually bring them to the market so
they are much more focused on validation
and compatibility and delivering a more
consistent user experience so what that
means is this drive should be far and
away the finest thing we've ever seen
out of ocz which is very very exciting I
mean remember something guys ocz has
taken a lot of flack over the years for
issues with in delinks controller drives
issues with sandforce controller drives
because their whole thing is they were
always first to market with it so all
these ocz drives were out there and even
though every other manufacturer had the
same issues ocz took a lot of the flat
because they had more drives out there
so there were more people complaining
about them whereas now they've decided
we're going to take a completely
different approach we're not going to
release this thing till it's completely
ready I haven't heard any complaints
about the vector yet
in terms of performance it is right up
there with samsung's new 840 pro I mean
think about that I mean back when ocz
was saying okay yeah we're going to be
an SSD company you're kind of looking at
going okay well Intel was just
dominating back then with the x.25
series and you're kind of going oh yeah
okay let's see if these guys can go up
against the juggernaut like in town that
Intel's kind of faded away now we're
kind of we were kind of saying all you
know samsung launched 842 840 pro how
are they going to go up against the
juggernaut like that while they figured
out a way so the vector is very
competitive with the 840 pro series it
uses 25 nanometer mlc flash so it's not
using TLC flash like the 840 which
causes it to have new not very good
write speeds compared to a flagship
product that is using mlc flash remember
TLC means three bits per cell as opposed
to two bits per cell which is what we're
seeing in the higher-end drives right
right the most exciting thing about this
it comes with the two and a half two
inch to three and a half in to know that
something most exciting thing about it
this is also the first ocz SSD you see
this in the links infused thing here so
if you guys remember the original end
links barefoot controller back in the
vertex and everyone else had access to
that too that was the first generation
in Billings controller then barefoot to
never really seemed to come to life from
unless that's what they ended up
branding the one in the octane and the
vertex 4 so then finally there was
another any links control of that was
actually not ocz designs silicon that
was a marvel controller that was then
repurposed with a with an ocz firmware
this is designed in-house by the plx
team the in the links team and another
sort of segment of the team based out of
OC Z's California headquarters so it is
designed from the ground up it uses an
ARM Cortex core and an Aragon
coprocessor whatever that guy does ocz
is not sort of giving out all of the
details about how exactly that works but
it is completely actually designed by
them both hardware and firmware and then
they're just finding a fab to
manufacture the chips for them i mean
same thing goes for the flash itself its
intel flash so ocz doesn't actually
manufacture the flash but their
packaging it themselves so once you
actually open up the drive everything's
ocz in there comes with all the mounting
options you'll need for your notebook so
there's your side mounts there's your
bottom mounts
idle power consumption is a little bit
higher than something like a samsung 840
pro boatload they're very very close
which means that it's totally suitable
for notebook use however I think most
people still these days are buying these
high-performance SSDs for desktop use
it's warrantied for up to five year are
up to five years well yeah up to five
years or I think it's something some
number of Tara I can't remember exactly
how many terabytes but their warranty it
for 20 gigs per day for five years so
think about that for a minute I mean
just for fun try to figure out how many
gigs you write to your boot drive every
day I can pretty much guarantee you it's
a lot less than 20 gigabit gigabytes and
then you know you go away for a week on
vacation maybe you don't use your
computer every single day now you've
banked up some more too i realistically
if you don't get more than five years
out of this drive then i'll be very very
surprised in terms of performance it's
right up there with drives like the 840
pro hangs with pretty much well I mean
the 840 pro has been in a league of its
own for a little while so it hangs with
that which means it is a perfect choice
for an enthusiast grade top-tier SSD it
also provides very consistent
performance whether it's the fact that
it has trim which I mean any sort of
modern SSD has or whether it's you know
how how cluttered up the drive is or
whatever else is going on with it it
responds very very consistently which to
me is what SSD is all about because you
can take a hard drive and you can go
okay yeah I'm going to write a
sequential file or read a sequential
file yeah it's almost as fast as an SSD
her it's not about that it's about when
things get rough when things get
fragmented on the actual drive itself
how well does it react when it has to
rely mostly on its random performance
and the vector performs very very well
so thank you for checking out this
unboxing and first look for those of you
who need a summary most important things
to take away our true flagship
performance drive the first truly ocz
design right down to the very heart and
soul of the drive that we've seen yet
and five year warranty so it's right up
there with everything else like the
until 5 20 series don't forget to
