sending us to PAX East 2016 this year to
check out all of their stuff check out
the link in the video description down
below so today Corsair we're checking
out their rapid-fire keyboards they have
a k70 non RGB they have a case 65 RGB
and a k70 RGB now what makes them
rapid-fire is the new cherry MX speed
switch so in the non RGB once it's just
the MX speed and in the RGB ones it's
the MX feed RGB what makes this switch
cool is its activation distance and its
total travel distance so it activates at
one point two millimeters instead of the
standard two millimeters that you would
find on a cherry switch and its overall
travel distance is three point four
millimeters instead of the overall
normal four millimeters for a cherry
switch so normally with mostly switches
you're pressing it down further and it's
actuated further down the press which is
exactly half way and now it's much
faster and you can feel it this is the
first time I've been able to try it in
person and it is definitely a faster
typing experience in terms of how it
feels though into like
in terms of how it feels
side of just how far down you have to
press it it's pretty much like a cherry
MX red but not exactly it's a 45 Grand
actuation force just like a cherry MX
right but it does feel heavier and I'm
getting the yeah it feels heavier from
pretty much everyone that I've talked to
that's fried it and some Corsair
employees so I'm not entirely sure
what's going on there I'd like to look
more into that later on maybe with the
corridor test or whatever and then it's
also a linear switch so that part does
feel like an MX red personally not my
kind of thing although it is really nice
to have that faster the keyboard I do
like feeling my actuation force so I'm
still going to lean towards a brown or a
blue but I am kind of in a minority as I
do believe Cherry MX Reds are the most
common switch out there and if you are a
fan of a red switch I would actually
recommend this because it's faster and
it doesn't feel bad at all it's
interesting to see this come on to the
market I'm assuming this is Corsairs
answer to the Romer G which is notorious
in a good way for having a fast overall
typing experience so we'll see how that
response works if you guys are
interested check out Corsair comm slash
win a rapid-fire they're giving away
three of these rapid-fire keyboards and
the contest is going on for about a
month so you should be able to enter
basically whenever you see this video as
long as you're not looking at it in like
halfway through 2016 or 2017 or
something like that
also if you want a good deal on a
keyboard you can get I believe it's 15%
off if when you purchase at Corsair comm
you use the code PAX East 2016 so I just
found that on like their table somewhere
so hopefully they don't mind me telling
everyone on the internet that there's a
special offer code for PAX East alright
guys let me know what you think of the
Cherry MX speed on twitter at luke
