another pc from the NCIX PC laboratory
so I'm in well you've got three guesses
as to whose office we happen to be in
here right now and the first two don't
count so basically he's got a new system
that we're working on for the end of the
month and this is going to be our
fastest Vesta PC ever this is the Vesta
6050 and it's actually going to be
available in a couple different
configurations so the one that we have
here since this is all balls to the
walls performance machine is actually
featuring dual gtx580 s it has a 120 gig
SSD it's gotten a suit republic of
gamers rampage 3 formula motherboard
core i5i five core i7 950 processor and
it also has 12 gigs of RAM now the
performance edition comes with ddr3 1600
and the base edition actually has some
key changes so it comes with ddr3 1333
it cuts up one of the graphics cards the
performance one comes not only with an
SSD but also with a large storage Drive
and the base one does not and then the
power supply is another key one so the
performance edition comes with a TX 850
watt power supply and the base edition
does not now the whole point of this
video is not just to show off the new
system that we have coming out oh oh
yeah they're both liquid cooled even
though you can't see it some feet look
liquid cooling is coming when we
actually put it in the case which is
going to be a fractal design define XL
so the base one uses in age 50 and the
performance one being the utter maximum
system that it is uses a corsair h70
liquid cooler but I also wanted to show
you guys the testing and validation
procedure that goes into these systems
and has actually helped us catch a lot
of problems before we release into the
general public for example we
encountered a rand kit that was
uniformly incompatible with every fenham
2 x4 + x6 processor on the market we had
no way of knowing the specs said they
should work but because of our
validation procedures we were able to
find out that the system was randomly
locking up and that even though the
parts weren't defective they didn't work
together even though they should work
together so basically we use a
host of different programs and these are
all enthusiast grade programs not your
you know grandpa's benchmarking program
so we use Linux as well as prime95
memtest and then for 3d we do a test
with vantage as well as furmark and with
all of these prototype systems so far
we've done at least some gameplay with
an intensive game like Crysis mafia two
just to make sure that besides the
synthetic benchmarks we're not going to
run into any problems with a demanding
modern game engine so this system this
prototype won't be ready probably for
another four to five days just because
the the crazy Russian needs to do a lot
more of his crazy brush and stuff on it
make sure that it passes all these tests
overnight and it's just crazy stable and
then we're going to be able to go ahead
and release the system around this so
thank you for checking out this little
video on the validation process that
goes on behind the scenes don't forget
to check out NCIX pc on facebook that is
