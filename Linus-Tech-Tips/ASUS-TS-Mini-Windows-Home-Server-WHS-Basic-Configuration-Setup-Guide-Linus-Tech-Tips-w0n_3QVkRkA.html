Home Server and it is a flavor of
Windows Home Server that is a custom
firmness suicide done an unboxing video
on it already and I also didn't have
video an on video a video where I show
how to upgrade the hard drive so I've
installed an additional 500 gig hard
drive there's one 500 gig included and
remember - you can also use all of the
expansion ports on the back including 6
USB and to eSATA to add additional hard
drive storage to this particular unit
this series of videos that I'm going to
be doing over the next little while is
going to be about Windows Home Server
and what makes it one of my favorite
pieces of software ever so let's have a
quick look at everything we're gonna
need first of all we've got a Quick
Start Guide then we have our user's
manual and then we have three separate
disks so the first disk we're going to
use is the software installation CD the
software installation CD as it's
probably going to tell me in the
QuickStart guide actually I'm going to
go ahead and put this in the drive first
and then I'll go ahead and show you the
QuickStart guide while we're working on
that so I'm going to throw this in the
district the software installation CD is
actually an optional step but you can
use it to install the Windows Home
Server software on your home computer
which will make it so that your home
computer will be able to detect and
connect to a Windows Home Server because
remember the TS mini and many home
servers does not have a VGA port so
there is actually no way to hook up a
display to it that means that you rely
on your network connection to the home
server in order to access its
administration options so I'm going to
go ahead run install and this is going
to install the Windows Home Server
connector so I'm gonna press next I'm
gonna go ahead and zoom in so you can
see some idea what I'm doing here I
accept the end-user license agreement
which I have thoroughly read and it is
now trying to locate my home so I guess
I better turn it off the lights on on
the top that's a good sign
alright so let's have a quick look at
the Quick Start Guide while that is
doing its thing
so first step in the trick start guide
is probably something along these lines
oh I see setting up your TS mini aha see
me missed this important step turning it
on
aha but but I've managed to do this so
I've got it connected to a power plug as
well as my Ethernet cable to a gigabit
switch it's pretty important to use
gigabit with home server because it'll
work with ten hundred but it's not going
to give you a very satisfactory
experience and it should be noted that
Windows Home Server will not run on a
wireless connection for the home server
you can have wireless client pcs so like
that computer over there could be
wireless but the home server must be
wired
ok so installing the software on your
computer guess that was the first thing
I did so I was slightly out of order ah
so now it's uh couldn't find my home
server because probably because I didn't
have it plugged in at first so I'm gonna
go ahead and go to find my home server
manually and the home server name should
be let me see if they're gonna tell me
what the home server name is going to be
hmm
no no they're not going to make it quite
that easy for me okay well why don't we
try another automatic search so go back
search again which is what is
recommended let's just follow the
recommended steps and see if that works
if you installed Windows Home Server
from from a disk on a custom PC then
you'll know what the name of the home
server is but I actually don't know what
the name of this one is okay so number
three getting started so once it detects
the home server you will bring in the
login wind up the login window enter the
administrator password okay I don't know
what the administer it is for this one
adding a hard drive I already covered
that in a separate edition of NCIX or
rather Linus tech tips setting up user
accounts okay so that's a step that
we'll get to as soon as that is done I'm
going to go ahead and stop the camera
for now as a bit of an aside the second
automatic search failed but I typed TS
mini with no spaces into
find it manually option and it turned
out that was the name so I have I guess
I've hacked my TS many homes over here
so now it's going ahead and installing
the Windows Home Server connector
software it should be noted it doesn't
actually install it from the disk what
it does is the disk just tells your
computer how to look for our home server
and then it downloads the software from
the home server and installs it from
there to make sure that it has the
latest edition so you can choose here
this is this is one of the biggest
features of Home Server automatic
computer backup so it gives you a couple
options do you want to automatically
wake up this computer to back it up yes
I want to make sure this computer gets
backed up every day even if it is in
sleep or hibernate mode so I'm going to
go ahead and click Next a couple times
and hope that it registers at some point
there we go all right so the name of the
Home Server here we're finally setting
it up that didn't actually take that
long I shouldn't say finally the name of
the home server is going to be TS mini
sure that's fine the password now
something you should be aware of is that
the password here we go must contain
characters of at least three to the
following sets uppercase lowercase
numbers and symbols so I'm gonna go
ahead and type a password and I'm not
gonna show you guys this because it's my
actual strong password okay so I'll go
ahead the reason it has to be a strong
password is that the administrator
account can have access to the home
server from a remote location so that
means that it has to be a password that
would be quite difficult to guess
all right we are going to use the
recommended settings to stay up to date
and it's preparing the Home Server so
I'll let you know about how long this
took that I'm going to turn off the
camera for now okay all that took about
three minutes that's not so bad it
installed all of the updates that I need
I'm going to go ahead and click start
and then I'm going to enter my password
which I need two hands for a story okay
show up I typed it right because it
takes a little while to sign-in
yeah I did not type it right sorry about
that let's try that one more time oh I
also I added an internet connection to
my switch here because I realized that
it was trying to download updates and I
did not have a network cable plugged
into my router I saw that there were a
couple of hints that it gave you while
it was installing and I there were a
couple pretty helpful ones remember the
password make sure you do not forget the
password because it would be quite
difficult to to riobueno lost it and
then one of the other hints that I
thought was pretty helpful was this one
you can stream media to every room with
Windows Home Server so you can stream to
another PC or to an Xbox 360 hmm okay
just a minute well I guess it was
installing some updates and restarting
because now I have connected to the
Windows Home Server console the first
thing that comes up is the console help
it says welcome to Windows Home Server
explore the Windows Home Server tray
icon on your home computer okay and it
tells you what all of the different
statuses mean so right now you can see
that it is grey although that's not
entirely correct because it is healthy
or not well maybe it's critical because
it says it's critical up here whatever
we'll figure that out later okay add
user accounts organize files and shared
folders configure backup customized
server settings ok I'm going to show you
how to do all of this so forget this
alright so computers in backups so you
can see the one computer that I have
configured is the one that I installed
the Windows Home Server connector
software on so this one let's configure
the backup so view backups right now I
don't have any okay I wonder why I can't
configure backups right now that's kind
of weird maybe we need to set up a user
account first all right
user account don't show this message
again ok I'm going to go ahead and add a
user account so user account first name
is going to be minus
okay last name is optional my login name
is going to be lioness now if I enable a
remote access which means I can access
all of my files from anywhere and I can
actually use remote desktop connection
to any supported PC on my home network
so you should only use that for people
who you want doing those things so in
this case I'm going to say I don't need
to bother with oh you know what no I
should enable it because that way we can
we can test it later so we can pick
which of these options are allowed all
right so that means I have to choose a
strong password at least seven
characters and it has to be a complex
password so three different types of
characters so set access to shared
folders these are all the folders that I
will have access to besides my own
personal folder so if you have multiple
user accounts and those will appear in
there as well you can set who has access
to whose shared folder so now we have
gone ahead and created that account so
that's a very strange thing network is
critical because I do not have
anti-virus software installed on my on K
PC which I don't so thank you for
letting me know that so this has been a
basic setup guide shared folders let's
just stop it there and then I'll cover
some of the other features in separate
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
