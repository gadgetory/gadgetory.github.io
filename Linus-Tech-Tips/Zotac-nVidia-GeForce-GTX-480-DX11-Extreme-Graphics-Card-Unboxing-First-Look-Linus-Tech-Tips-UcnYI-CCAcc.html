GTX 480 card this is their highest end
geforce card at the moment they're
actually going to be releasing in the
upcoming weeks an amp version of this
and it's going to actually have a triple
slot cooler it's going to be clocked a
little bit higher that's going to be
pretty cool but for now this is what we
have to work with and this is what I'm
going to be using for an upcoming
episode of NCIS tech tips like I realize
I'm a little late to the GTX 480
unboxing party but what are you going to
do I needed it for something else anyway
so I might as well unbox it so the first
thing that you should notice about the
zotac box is it has a cool metallic guy
on it okay that might not be the first
thing the first thing you should notice
about the zotac box is this deckle right
here the orange one there EXO TAC
extended warranty so what that means is
ZOTAC now offers lifetime warranties on
all of their high-end g-force products
so you have to register the card after
you get it but a lifetime warranty can
be worth its weight in gold if you
actually end up having a problem later
on down the line it also comes with the
zotac boost software suite so that
includes bada-boom for encoding videos v
real for enhancing videos I've never
actually heard of this one but it seems
to be called super something super
loyola scope or something like that
apparently that's for editing videos
I've never heard of that one and then
you've also got bitdefender internet
security so most of these are CUDA
applications so that means that they can
actually use the GPU rather than your
CPU to do that video encoding and to
enhance your video so that's a pretty
neat feature it's compatible with all
cuda GPU so that means anything
basically from an 8800 on up to the GTX
480 which is the latest and greatest it
has 1.5 gigs of memory on board it
supports physics as well as obviously
CUDA which I was talking about before
384 bit memory interface it has HDMI
onboard and let's get around to the back
so actually let's talk minimum system
requirements for a minute and you need a
PCI Express slot it doesn't need to be
pcie 2.0 but if you're really installing
a card like
and a PCIe one motherboard you might
want to re-evaluate your system upgrade
you need one six pin and one eight pin
PCI Express connector this is a
power-hungry card I've actually done a
few videos already on the power
consumption of four GTX 480 s but I
haven't really done anything on a single
card I don't think so maybe that's
something nothing worth worth touching
on let me see what else we have on here
as well so it's DirectX 11 that's
another thing that I should probably
mention you've got full support for
DirectX 11 including tessellation which
is one of the big features that Nvidia
is touting about the GTX 400 series in
general is that they have excellent
tessellation performance so that's going
to be one of the ways to improve image
quality with DirectX 11 over what we had
with DirectX 10 so as far as accessory
package goes we've got two molex to PCI
Express connectors one of them is a six
pin and I'm gonna hold this here long
enough for the camera to actually focus
cuz usually it doesn't bother to focus
and then I've got one that is oh oh this
is interesting okay so I have one that
is two molex to one PCIe six pin that I
just showed you and then this one is two
PCIe six pin to one PCIe eight pin so if
you have a power supply that was sort of
like woefully under connected so let's
say you've got aa og how'd you do this
so if you only had two PCI 6 pin I guess
what you could do is you could take your
two PCI 6 pin plug them into here plug
that into the 8 pin and then take 2
molex connectors 4 pins and plug this
into the 6 pin so then you would have
power to your video card I have one DVI
to VGA adapter and rather than being a
boring beige one it's like a clear
plastic one big fan then I have one mini
HDMI to HDMI adapter so if you're going
to use HDMI and you want to be able to
plug your video card into an HDMI
display then that will be useful because
mini HDMI is not all that common yet
these days okay inside here we have a
bunch of pieces of paper
let's have a look at these really
briefly first of all it says before
booting your PC make sure you plug in
the power also please
your graphics card to cool before
touching it after operation these things
get toasty
we've got DirectX 11 and technology
demos up well okay so this includes some
technology demos from Nvidia for DirectX
11 very neat then we have a ZOTAC driver
CD download the latest drivers off the
Nvidia website as if I haven't said that
enough times the latest drivers are
awesome they add a whole bunch of
functionality and a whole bunch of
performance for the GTX 400 series then
we have the zotac boosts GeForce
accelerated a software thing there we go
they're just telling us a little bit
more about it then we have the zotac
extended warranty and quick installation
guides so they talked a lot about the
terms and conditions of the warranty I
actually checked out ZOTAC STIs and sees
of the warranty before I started this
video and they have one of the better
ones out there because a lot of the time
you know you might say see lifetime
warranty asterisks and then it turns out
that lifetime warranty means like as
long as that products available or some
other kinds of clutches but the zotac
one actually looks really good and
that's going to be one of the subject of
one of the tech tips videos that we're
going to be doing around this card is
actually how important warranty support
is when you're dishing out a few hundred
dollars for a graphics card this is a
user's manual it has their metallic guy
on it and then let's actually have a
look at the card itself so this is a
reference GTX 480 that means it is a
standard length card it has its standard
connector so we've got two DVI and one
mini HDMI although it only supports two
displays out at a time up at the top
we've got our two sli connectors so this
video card does support up to four-way
SLI if you check out my previous videos
I've actually shown some demos with
four-way SLI running in the cooler
master half next case up at the top you
can see four of the five heat pipes that
are used in this cooler the last one is
actually I'm just going to get up and
sort of show you the card a little
better here the last one is actually
down in there so you can see number five
so these five heat pipes are basically
all positioned directly over the GPU
itself and then they're taking that heat
and dispersing it out into this
ginormous cooler here this is actually a
heatsink surface as well this is not a
shiny plastic cover so it's very serious
about dissipating heat from the GeForce
GTX 480 here we've got our 8 pin PCIe as
well as our 6 pin PCI II and speaking of
heat dissipation here is our fan
that'll be doing all of the heat
dissipation it has access not only to
airflow from the front but also from the
back of the card through a couple of
holes in the PCB we first saw this on in
videos dual GPU cards but now it's
actually made its way to their single
GPU cards now that they run so postie
here is our pcie 2.0 16x connector as
well as what else do we even have here
ah here more more vents no no actually
that's kind of interesting
ok so at the back here this is actually
just like no access to the fan
whatsoever so all of the fans airflow is
going to be blowing out through the back
of the cart
so unlike ATIS 5870 the whole back slot
here is dedicated to air being expelled
from the case whereas with the 5870
you've actually got another DVI
connector here and you've only got
exhaust from half of it so that's one
way to get better airflow is by not
blocking off your case air from going
outside anyway ok this is getting a
little bit long thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the zotac GTX</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
