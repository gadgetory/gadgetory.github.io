twitchchat do we have audio do we have
audio whip flickers what flickers I work
we have light are we good
does it work okay it's all good
so but I'm like super low not impressed
right now because we were doing did you
if you saw that that unboxing we did up
the Kraken X 40 where we were doing a
dual cam setup we were using xsplit to
record the both both camera angles and
we were trying to capture audio to the
FS or through the FS and it wasn't
working
it was popping and doing a lot of crazy
sounds and stuff yeah but it wasn't I
don't think it was as bad as what yeah
well I think it's the problems that
there was already plus the fact of like
putting it through xsplit which is like
barely working and then streaming it
online to all these people like the
combination of all those things probably
just made it so much worse but basically
that that puts me in a position where
I'm kind of sitting here going well how
does how's this supposed to work cuz I
can record audio just fine to SD on this
guy but something about opening the HDMI
suddenly doesn't work guys this is the
exact setup that we were using for live
streams in the past and we didn't change
anything and yeah so I mean we're sorry
but I don't know what else to tell you
because tonight we sat down to prep for
the live stream an hour ago and we
should have been just ready to go and
everything should have just been fine
but we've got a boat I don't know what
half a dozen blue screens on the editing
computer that ended up irony of ironies
being caused by our AVerMedia live gamer
HD which usually is totally solid
compared to the Blackmagic car
which usually crash and cause all kinds
of random horrible problems but I think
it might be because we were using the
bottom PCIe 4x slot on a z77 board which
is routed through the chipset rather
than being routed directly to the CPU so
yeah that sucked
yeah um one other thing uh as I've seen
a couple times posted in the extra chat
as you may have heard the forum is kind
of a live it's down right now because of
physical server relocation meaning DNS
servers that are everywhere I have to
repopulate and refigure out where my
server is so that you guys can go to the
forum good news is everything will be
exactly how it was the minute before I
brought the server down so you're not
gonna lose your posts you're not gonna
lose your accounts yeah you're not gonna
lose whatever you had it's just gonna be
down until something some way or decides
that everyone can now see the forum and
we're really thrilled with how much
traction there's been on the forum
already I mean you guys have been
amazing and I don't think even that many
of you know about it yet yeah I mean
dude do any of do any of you guys know
yet there's a few people one guys saying
what is the IP screw wave the DNS I
can't do that because the htaccess file
in my apache folder is pointing certain
things in certain places based off of
your own name so if you go to the IP
address it's just like an FTP site
basically so it's not really gonna help
you very much um nexium my buddy and I
have been spending incredible amounts of
times
huge thanks to him he's done tons of
things that I have no idea what he's
doing it's all of hoodoo magic he's but
huge part of the reason pretty much the
reason why the forum was up at all
so thanks nexium but we've been slaving
away making vv5 be both in five work at
all it's incredible we are the only site
that I know if it's actually a
production website like not like an
example web site hosted
IV bulletin that's actually running this
software and there's a lot of things
that are broken like editing posts has a
lot of you have probably already noticed
just doesn't work like you can edit the
post but when it goes to the Edit screen
your post isn't there so it's good it's
kind of weird like there's a lot of
stuff that's broken like that that we
can't fix because that's based on
vBulletin there's a lot of stuff that's
going around that we can fix that is
kind of messed up the view bulletin has
like okay we're using like different
sizes for attachments and stuff the
defaults for that are very weird and not
what they actually say when it tells you
like oh it has to be these dimensions at
this size it's not actually those
dimensions of that size so we are
looking into problems that we can fix
and hopefully vbulletin beta 24 is as
nexium would say the holy grail of beta
releases and hopefully it fixes
everything but other than that the forum
is working pretty okay
the main problem we actually add was
speed which is the reason why we did the
relocation and we pulled it from here
where it was running on a line that was
5 megabits per second up megabit maybe
bit think you said megabytes per second
I meant to say megabits per second to
align ncx head office which I was hoping
was gonna be 40 megabits per second up
but is actually now that we got there 25
but that's still incredibly faster from
what we have right now and will
hopefully get above the bottleneck that
we're currently sitting on it to be
clear guys this isn't an NCIX forum this
is a Linus tech tips dedicated forum
they're just sponsoring us the bandwidth
increase that we need for now we're
hoping to move either to an off-site
host somewhere or get some kind of like
baller internet connection here which
may may actually be an option I mean we
can pick ourselves up a load balancing
router for about a hundred and fifty
bucks and then Shaw has a new service
they're rolling out here that's going to
be 15 megabit up we can pull two lines
in so we might be able to do 25 to 30
megabit percent
from here which would be that would be
really cool sort of redonkulous I would
like to have the server on site we're
hardware guys so it's cool to be able to
like actually manage the server here
yeah but you have to do some key
jiggering to be able to manage it
off-site we should tell them about the
config you have oh I know it's kind of
ridiculous but so there's two servers
right now there's two servers right now
one of them's windows one of them's
Linux we're trying to move everything
over to the Linux box but then we
couldn't like properly SSH into the
Linux box so off next - oh man I spent
ridiculous amounts of time today just
trying to make it so that we could
actually connect to the boxes on its
axis Network because they have us behind
like layers of networking so it's kind
of odd trying to control things when I
have no control over the routers of the
switches so I'm just like calling up the
networking guy every once in a while
I'll be like hey I need this kind of
changed so that was very interesting
hey it's me again please do this please
I mean access please and everything
ended up being can I get a rig but is
working and yeah well we're at CES I've
got I've got one super moderator set up
and I've got a few moderators set up
everyone's kind of on a trial basis
right now so watch those moderators let
me know what you think of them make sure
they're all doing Fairplay I think
they're all really they seem like really
good guys I like the moderator so far
but we need to make sure that they're
all actually really good guys so pay
attention then but the only admin that's
me running online so the only guy that's
gonna be like controlling the back end
of the site well we're at CES is gonna
be nexium so good luck to you
thanks man we appreciate it
if it like actually if the computer
power is down and doesn't like turn back
on so like if it doesn't restart or
anything like that and we're it's a yes
we're kind of screwed because it's
sitting in a room that so basically
don't ddos us greatly appreciate
don't like don't go to the NCIX head
office and cut the power lines
I mean you shouldn't do that these are
things I shouldn't have to say so far
everybody on the forum and everybody on
Twitter and everything has been super
helpful that's really nice
reporting problems is great reporting
stuff like it's slow like that's good
that you told me but we know we know
it's slow part of it is the five megabit
connection we've been on part of it is
the fact that V bulletin 5 is just kind
of a dog yeah when we browse on it
locally there's still that delay like
when you click on a thread the page
populates and then there's like one two
three steamboats before you can actually
click on something we can't stress
enough the backend for the forum VB both
and v is still in a pretty brutal stage
of beta so there's a lot of stuff that
we can't control one of the members of
the vbulletin community was calling it
was calling them some kind of a travesty
that they're even calling this a beta
yeah I needs like a pretty esteemed
member of V building community max
possible reputation points 30,000 posts
like really big guy and he's raging it
was like this is an alpha this is not a
beta yeah and we're running it on
production yeah so hang with us things
will be fixed some of its out of our
control and I'm going as fast as I can
with nexium to fix everything else that
is within our control all right so why
don't we let's do some Twitter shall we
oh okay the angles a little funny we
actually don't have the we don't have a
mount for the camera so it's sitting on
a cardboard sheet on top of the actual
tripod yeah I don't have the tools handy
to remove the stupid mounting plate from
the FS and we're trying to get this back
up as soon as we possibly could so it's
okay it's just not worth then use a
quarter I don't have a quarter on me
calm down all right so let's do some Q&amp;amp;A
what's a good mechanical keyboard under
70 bucks toys they're not under 70 bucks
you can find it was sometimes $69.99 I
think I've seen a quick-fire like the 10
coolest ones $69.99
okay there you go if you can find it
possibly somewhere ever yeah possibly
some wherever I mean asking for
mechanical keyboard under 70 bucks is me
being like hey where can I get a good
like uber gaming graphics card for under
a hundred and fifty bucks it's like well
sorry it just just doesn't work that way
my jacket is ugly Matt asks my CPU is an
FX 4100 it doesn't perform well in CPU
heavy games
well upgrading to an i-5 35 70k show me
a noticeable difference the answer is
yes especially once you're overclocking
at 35 70 K will destroy an FX 4100 FX
4100 is basically okay think I'd think
of it this way guys phantom one didn't
actually really improve anything over
previous but branding did they even use
f1 64's I think before that phantom to
improved very little over phantom 1 it
was like an incremental lake like like a
talk and then FX didn't really improve
anything over Fenton - and then that's
where you're at
so you're basically running an Athlon 64
where as Intel has been marching along
in terms of CPU performance 3570 cable
just destroy a 4,100 editing post that
comes in the next beta of people listen
right supposedly but it was also in
previous betas so
this is what I was talking about about
brutal beta stage is like features that
used to be in it are not in it and
features that were today before are in
it like it's it's very much a beta and
then our version of it like what we've
changed the stuff is still also in beta
so you're basically running the beta
stage of a beta is what your form is so
yeah we're doing good yeah thoughts on
PC 360 I've heard it's a BC er version
over 350
I'm not a big 350 fan okay so it's
probably better than 350 I buy 7h
probably I like them a lot more than 350
s have you tried this 360 I never tried
but uh Harrison's got some oh okay yeah
if they're like actually I like them for
a headset I'm not usually way into
headsets right I like headphones with a
mic but for a headset they're pretty
awesome yeah I built my first computer
today how come you never told me the
back of the motherboard was pokey um I
didn't think of it you know what guys
when you're building your first computer
be careful of the metal on the outside
of the power supply it can be cold
we're teasing oh it's all good it's all
good you did good
good work building your first computer
feel free to post a picture of it on
face the picture and post the specs and
when the forums up got a new build
section and yeah poster build cuz that's
awesome yeah have you ever built a
hackintosh um that project is play kind
of ready to go like I have the installer
files on my USB Drive that I'm ready to
install on the motherboard that we
brought back to the back to the lab
today so hopefully soon but not before
we go to CES yes it's gonna be like Oh
ridiculous all of our time before CES it
was kind of devoted to like finishing
off projects and me starting and
hopefully finishing but that didn't
happen the forum makes it happen it's
not gonna be finished well it's never
finished
- Shaye's yeah but it's it's it's I hope
the form comes to life see I'm getting
kind of worried finish anything before
that no and then even when we got back
from CES for the first day or two we're
probably gonna be just like managing
stuff that we didn't get to release
while we're su yes and we'll probably be
sleeping cuz we'll probably be sick I
don't sleep every year I get like just
super sick people because you don't
sleep there's a million people there
from all corners of the world where
they've got all kinds of weird diseases
that I've never been exposed to and I
was gonna say I've made it through pax
every year but pax is a weekend not an
entire week so this will be this will be
a new challenge oh yeah
CES is is a haul see it slicks ever been
to CES this will be my fourth or fifth
year now and it's it is it is people
think it looks fun but it's not fun -
Willie IPS makes a huge difference from
a TN panel the answer is yes forum must
be up because it's down it won't load
for me too much traffic no no it's
definitely down it's down like not
because of too much traffic or it being
broken we physically move to the server
like we're doing this morning when you
ran out of gas haha it just hasn't been
a good day in general like the tech tips
episodes the NCI expected episodes we
filmed at at MCI xhq today one of them
was like a build guide in an m-80 X
machine that's actually within
Silverstone's classification of small
form-factor so this n ATX tower system
is actually not much taller than an N
ATX board like in the lone Vista yeah go
get it go get it we'll show it to them
I'll explain it in the meantime so it's
not much taller than an M ATX board we
put dual GTX 680 s in it we put a
thousand watt power supply we put I
think we changed it is it if you have it
already oh here we go
alright so it's in the sukkah
in case and holy crap this is one of the
most difficult machines I've ever built
in spite of the fact that I did a full
build guide on it
in spite of the fact that I did a full
build guide on it at the end of the
video I had no choice but to say look
guys I don't recommend this for novice
builders so check this out it's not
actually much bigger than a shuttle it's
about the same length as a shuttle and
it's about this much taller than a
shuttle it's got a 120 millimeter intake
in the front this is in the SGO 9 okay
it's got okay one of the video cards is
out now but it had dual 680 s in it see
like I said the m ATX board goes from
here to here so it's that bad gives you
some idea of the scale here this is a
120mm fan not a 140 and I'm gonna see if
I can get this this top panel off so
entertain them with talk about what
we're doing and see yes what are we
gonna do they're gonna have lots of
meetings we we've been so busy with
other stuff stuff we haven't even
discussed what we're gonna be doing at
CES that much so I don't make animals
don't even know I know we're gonna be
spending not as much time as I expected
on the show floor because we have a lot
of different Suites to go do within the
hotels which will be like a different
vendor will have like a suite where
they'll show off specific parts because
the show floor isn't big enough and not
personal enough well that and the show
floor is extremely expensive and I don't
think a lot of guys see the point yeah
if they can just hold a suite and then
get in contact with the exact people
they want to anyways it's not really
necessary worth it for them so yeah the
plan is we've got a pretty epic internet
connection hopefully so we'll be
hopefully shooting out videos actively
while we're there yeah we've noticed one
problem with reviewers that go down to
the CES is that they don't release their
stuff until like way after and then it's
usually pretty lackluster so our plan is
to be uploading it as fast as we can
every single night okay check this out
sorry Stage two of showing you guys this
machine so this case holds two three
1/2 inch hard drives here and here we
have 2 SSDs and raid 0 down there that's
2m force right there you can put another
two SSDs here if you want slimline
optical drive in the top okay see that
tower cooler in there this thing is full
of stuff plugging in
see I didn't look closely at the at the
instructions silverstone includes for
this case our TM guys our TM because and
ok they also made a slight mistake
because they show when you install the
motherboard they showed the CPU heatsink
installed on it that's wrong because a
guitar would you have to install the
motherboard install the 4 pin and then
put the heatsink on but I was thinking
maybe I could put it on before it
settled a there's something like that so
anyway I had a really hard time plugging
the 4 pin in I ended up having to take
the heatsink off again to plug it in and
then and then I realized I forgot to
plug in the CPU not cool not cool at all
but here I want to give you guys a
closer look at this I think it's on
autofocus so you should be able to see
so there's a silverstone duel tower heat
pipe cooler there's some high profile
memory in there this is a really cool
cooler because it has one fixed side and
one thin side so that you have enough
room for all your memory slots
good idea hey there's the power supply
right at the front there with
pass-through 2 cord at the back see you
right there that's where that plugs in
and then while you keep talking about
CES plans I'm gonna take off the bottom
part of the panel so you can see where
the graphics cards go again ok
if you commit things to them now then
there's nothing I can do about it and
we'll have to do your ideas so we're
gonna be eating out very nicely the
entire time we're there this is coming
out of my pocket I was sponsored by the
company No ok we'll probably be eating
with all the inside um you'll be lucky
if you get McDonald's now yeah
Samsung has an interesting TV yeah I
think they released this press room
you're not number number number four
you
23
you
you know the audio is there audio still
is their audio now
you
okay so we can't show huh
yeah we can't fix now is it yep all
right fixed it soggy everyone so back
and foot okay
tell them okay so as you can see there
Samsung released this picture and then
some blurb about how like true
innovation comes when you like change
the shape of things and all we got
something along those lines basically
this huge thing about how they're
changing the shape of the TV and then
they release this picture which makes me
think like why why is it in portrait
mode and that's not really a different
shape either it smells a rotated shape
you turn a bit like this like okay well
they turn it vertically press one okay
now they can see us again so I don't
understand how this is different from
taking an existing TV I'm just I like
they have a driver control panel for
that I think it's called you know the
Nvidia control panel
ATI control panel just turning monitor I
don't know I'm kind of hoping it's more
than just a portrait mode TVs because I
don't see a portrait mode TV being very
applicable maybe the point they're
trying to make is the extreme realism of
the image and like how thin it is or
something it's an awful lot of hype to
generate over but then the second you
try and watch a movie is it gonna be
like half your screen is gone no there's
no way it's a portrait mode TV but look
at the shape its in I know but you could
just take that shape and go like this so
what I need is good constant lease will
be your TV no I mean it might just be
thinner but then this is like I said
this is a lot of height to generate over
finishes shape and brighter and more
vibrant and more 3d which is what
probably what it is like it since I
started going to CES it's been nothing
but 3d TVs and here we are but three
four years later and it's still 3d TVs
and I'm just kind of like okay
so last year the big thing was was 3d
TVs but not using them for 3d it was
like having cruise alternating images so
that two people could watch TV and
something else at the same time yeah or
not split screen split screen
PlayStation TV yes something like that
has has okay here would love to hear
this guys has anyone on Twitter or or in
the twitch chat actually encountered
someone who is actually using that
solution
are we local recording as well I don't
know yeah press 0 yay okay oh yeah one
of my old roommates where two people are
playing the game at the same time seeing
different oh look at that guy
yeah oh okay yeah so I don't know if it
really counts it was like black ops
zombies that's exactly what it was black
ops black ops fanboy but only the zombie
mod I only knew that he did it once I
don't know if he did it other than that
and it was with like one of his buddies
who also used to be a roommate of ours
quite a while ago yeah check this out
guys so I had two GeForce graphics cards
in here two gtx 680 so they were going
all the way to here there's the power
supply there's the cpu heatsink you can
put up to 32 gigs of ram in here just a
monster monster machines check out that
fan in the top just like almost
hilariously stupidly full of stuff so
anyway what I'm trying to say it's not
that it's not a really cool case and not
that it isn't a really cool machine but
that it was really hard to build in and
because when you film how to build a PC
episode there's no such thing as like
running some benchmarks and doing some
prep before the episode like you can
prep you can sort of you can read up on
it you can sort of think you can bus
around the things and see how it all
works but you have to actually build it
you have to actually do
every step and some of them were just
really hard yeah to do I was off in the
corner with my crazy setup of multiple
servers mess around with nexium hearing
like oh we gonna redo that I gotta take
motherboard out again oh I get here the
amount of frustrated that was on the
other side of the room you know what it
wasn't as bad as the FTO three minute
one know that once I was just a weird
case it's very cool very good so again
cuz it's a Colin yeah it's column case
and again like an impressive amount of
hardware you know small space yeah but
but very dense at least the power supply
was a lot easier on this one than it was
on the FTO 3 because of the short cables
because of the short cable can't that
you can get with Strider series power
supplies so I hear let's do some Twitter
that where's the Twinkie box Twinkie box
is slicks in the way right there alright
- what tips you have for up-and-coming
tech people read lots reading lots is
the most important thing for
up-and-coming tech people go on our
forum when it's up yeah hey hey that's
it
gonna be lots of up-and-coming tech
people here ah this is for slick so
we're gonna get lucky with Tiger imports
you go Tiger imports as a cm storm
trigger with blue switches worth my
money what's a storm trigger that was a
big fire what's the difference between
the two on a pretty sure you unbox the
trigger I guess things are good they're
quite good keywords okay yeah I didn't
know yeah tuning in at 5:30 we're sorry
we're late guys crazy problems watched
the archives here move closer to the
camera look at his eyes I'm pretty tired
I had no idea why by Canon last time I
hate Sony ever set it back to stock say
trust me that won't fix the problem and
we are using a CAD
now which has this canon camera has its
own set of issues as well oh yeah
okay back to like 24 minutes ago so I
saw a whole bunch of people posting that
they had never seen anyone do the split
screen monitor thing yeah I jumped over
there while you're doing the system I'm
like just everyone's like no no
definitely not no definitely not
okay here's a good question for Marcus
um what do you expect from AMD
ah yes expect I'm gonna go look for some
of my topics that I had that I had up so
I'll get you what do you expect from me
ah yes yes I don't expect much I hope
for a lot honestly 100% honest they
haven't been moving that quickly lately
over the last few years but they need to
so hopefully if they come up with some
crazy awesome stuff it - yes that would
be great at 64 and then I've got one for
my parents that was iPhone 64 x2 I loves
both those processors they're amazing
great great great processors and then
yeah they do well on the graphics on the
side though ATI is very strong AMD a8 C
is very strong that you can usually get
more frames for your dollar move on what
I've seen going with AMD cards whether
that makes you buy them out that's
totally up to you but yeah usually you
can you can pump them really hard you
can usually over cock them like crazy
yeah I don't know but I worried about
the processor side very worried about
the processor side but then again they
could come up with something crazy so
hopefully they do that'll be great it's
a yes I mean I'd love to see how the
whole I mean okay we we talked a little
bit about the Nvidia intel potential
merger the rumor just a rumor guys right
now but we talked a little bit about
what that could mean for the future
maybe not particularly on mobile when
you look at Intel's expertise on
manufacturing and videos expertise on
GPU and their experience with arm and
just like what kind of crazy process
we could see I would love to see I mean
they've talked about how they're gonna
focus more on it and I know she was his
name I can't remember one of their CEOs
got got outed not that long ago because
he said he didn't care about mobile and
it seems like something they do want to
do but I'd love to see what AMD an ATI
could deliver
because the only reason that Tygra has
any huge advantage over anything
is that GeForce ecosystem and I'm not
even talking just the graphics
performance of it because it's not that
competitive compared to something like
iPad weight not today or even or or even
some of the other solutions but the
GeForce ecosystem is the developer
relationships it is the the way that
they're used to writing games that are
powered by GeForce compatibility
developer always working the fact that a
tiger 3 runs pretty much the same damn
way as a GTX 680 on some level just the
way that the software and the hardware
are interfacing and the way that the
game interacts with it so that is why
Tegra is so important right now
whereas AMD maybe not quite to the same
extent as in video in terms of developer
relationships but so much stronger than
Qualcomm yeah or Intel or maybe named
anyone else it's a two horse race
ATI Nvidia radio and GeForce so I'd love
for them to just kind of show up to that
fight and start doing something
somewhere somewhere something something
interesting we're talking about gravis
Kurt's far cry 3 really surprised me
with how hard it was to run I don't
think - is plenty yet but you were big
fan of far cry too weren't you
I know right it was terrible I thought
you liked far cry 2 it was a piece of
crap I thought you said you played it a
whole bunch times I'm far cry 1 loves
far cry 1 far cry 1 out
and ingame did you ever play it you're a
little young for that yeah what were you
like nine when it came out I don't think
so I'm pretty sure cuz I look maybe like
eleven yeah you were like a kid anyways
yeah fuck I was girl fuck I too was crap
the responding guys all that stuff was
crap I okay you know what though I
forgot about this is a good story far
cry 2 I actually played it a fair bit
cuz I hadn't really played like I'd
never played Grand Theft Auto or like
any other sort of open-world sandbox II
right okay yeah so I'd never really done
that a little battle thing and the
graphics were great and you know the
gunplay is good and all of that I
couldn't finish it
I got a save game like all the way deep
into the game and did you play Far Cry 2
yeah but really really quickly in once
ok one of the things is that you're sick
do you remember that yeah okay you get
sick so you have to get like malaria
medications like sometimes and what
happens is it gives you like a
notification that you need to get
malaria meds like soon and so one of my
save games and I I think it was Otto is
it autosave for that game or something
like that oh I was doing physically too
far away to get anywhere with meds I
tried probably a dozen times in every
direction in every possible way so I
would just die and I was like well I'm
not starting over
cuz the whole game is just a grind my
best three with that is morrowind you
start the game and they give you this
package and you're supposed to go give
it to this guy but it's just like oh
yeah I give this package of this guy and
you can sell it so with the beating the
game you're like oh I want money you
sell everything in your inventory you're
done you can't start the main quest but
it doesn't exactly tell you what the
main quest is cuz it's a like uber
definition of sandbox game right like
amazing game but you could just go screw
off like I played this game for months
and had no idea what the main quest was
had never started it I
multiple characters always sold the book
her package thing eventually eventually
my dad and I were like this ski was
amazing but we know we're missing a lot
let's go get the players guide so we can
find all the stuff that we're missing
while the players guy was like whoa
there's a main class and it's
interesting but I don't absolutely start
playing the game that is so much worse
than mine it's not even funny I love
like so many hours in that game but
without even actually playing the game
without playing the main quest but
that's how good that game was like it
didn't matter I never got into it I
think it doesn't help though that I'd
already logged like a bajillion hours on
oblivion and then you kind of have to go
through cuz I never played Marling the
journal system in Morrowind is very
difficult to just pick up you gotta be
used to it and like once you get I think
it's the tribunal expansion it makes it
so you can actually navigate to
individual quests in your journal but
before then it's just your guy writing
logs about things that's happening and
it's just like a journal so if something
happened a couple days ago and you've
done a whole bunch of stuff to figure
out why you're out of that quest yeah if
I flip through pages and like figure it
out like it's not very new friendly and
I like I like I fired it up once and I
got my character and that's gonna be
like cat dude and yeah I went like down
the path it was just like I was like
well come on what there's no like
there's no like noob friendly like
questing zone at the beginning a little
bit but not that much they say can you
snap like a little bit better why you're
done now like it's got D&amp;amp;D rolling
systems for attacks so if you run up
something you can be like I'm not
hitting you cuz you'll just keep on
rolling and if you're not good enough at
that skill so like say dagger I can just
stab and stab and stab this happens to
have and never hit over like ha ha ha ha
ha my defence numbers are higher than
your dagger rolling numbers I then win
because of the DD system right so it's
it's not very new friendly in that
aspect right ok well I had a topic for
discussion
why does Nero bother to still update
their disk burning software we talked
about this a bit ago the only thing I
was able to come up with was
compatibility with different systems
okay let me put it this way
it's the highest I have an ancient
version of Europe that I bought way back
like early XP days back when you bought
burning software because now there's
free okay so okay so aside from the fact
that it doesn't need any new
functionality there's free options that
are just as good now is that so that may
be the thing then they roll out a new
version make you buy the new version
make you buy the new version Holly don't
make you buy it that same version runs
on Windows 8 just know I know I know but
like like no character you have version
4 to get version 5 I'm just using Y
right into my own version 5 I'm just
saying if you had version 4 to get
versified you have to buy it or does it
update I think you have to buy it yeah
yeah okay so it's for people that are
super tech savvy near the goal I need
the newest best one what could they
possibly think they need the newest best
one for that huh like that Allah says
keep your stuff updated okay why don't
they just do this then why don't they
just lay off their entire development
team and just change numbers just change
the numbers and change my skin it hire
some designers to be skinny hire one
designer for your attire like what I
don't know what nationality is there in
disk burning over the last six years
LightScribe let's go em disk and this
doesn't require some special softness
that all done through though ginger all
done through the special laser that
engraves into the special medium nothing
on the software side and so that's just
the droid yeah so LightScribe and
LightScribe did the same on the software
end okay it's possible we need a blu-ray
software blu-ray 'very who would burn a
blu-ray I've just see why there might be
something for all of you out there who
have burned a blu-ray I'm gonna open
your eyes to a fantastic world of
amazingness that you are just gonna be
blown away by it is called the archiving
your stuff on a hard drive system
so blu-ray discs how much do they cost
now I don't know I've never bought one
last time I looked at was around eight
bucks but I'm sure it's cheaper now
let's say there let's say they're three
dollars just for the sake of argument
let's say there are three dollars how
many gigs of data do they store it's
twenty five one's gonna cook this yeah
but then you can get these dual layers
yeah but those cost a lot I'm sure they
do those are actually like baller
expensive yeah so okay so 25 gigs on a
blu-ray so here this is this is we're
gonna do a quick price comparison here
so NCIX down we're gonna look at how
much a two terabyte external drive costs
so do not do not do not do around a
hundred bucks okay so that is two
thousand divided by 25 25 equals eighty
blu-ray discs blu-ray it already loses
whoa hold on there we go
so single blu-ray disc so that's a 50
gig for seven bucks okay so that's a
rewritable for ten by the way hard
drives are all rewritable okay probably
more than your rewritable disc okay I
can't even see there's a 2-pack for 30
bucks much do these things these can't
be right seriously okay this is worse
than I thought okay so four okay so okay
so you can get them for as little as
around a buck but that's like Rosewill
so anything that's like a real a real
brand it's probably more like more like
double that so about about two bucks
each so $160 yeah so 160 bucks is what
you're paying for your blu-ray discs oh
man guys just don't do it I mean
something like this is so perfect these
backup buses are great because they come
on a little like dock thing here's a
tech tip for you guys back everything up
to hard drives so they come on a little
dock thing and then look at this it's
basically like the size of like a VHS
cassette so you just have a shelf you
like put these on it
you put a little label on the handy
dandy label friendly spot with some
masking tape boom you've archived your
media on something that is less likely
to degrade then then a plastic disc on
something that is much more much much
more likely to still be around in the
future in terms of finding something
that'll read it easily although CDs been
pretty resilient but then how useful is
a CD at this point you can repurpose it
for other things you can take the whole
thing apart repurpose it for an internal
drive throw it in a server you can
easily swap them in and out just by
popping them on to a base station just
like that so and you can plug as many or
as few into your computer as you want
you can sync from one to another one so
you can backup from one to another
they're faster to write you ever even
need to do this
the only disk solution that I would ever
see being better than that is like super
super super important documents that you
write to them discs yeah and it's got a
ton of sold on em disc is kind of
amazing but then the capacities aren't
that high yeah
so use like backup hard drives like just
lectures everything and then yeah like
hard drives for like movies and yeah
everything else and disc is like
precious family photos are like your
will baby pictures wedding pictures are
very important things yeah super
important documents like you said will
stuff like that bothered match backup
hard drives don't bring blu-rays and
like people think of it in terms of the
transactional price I think sometimes
because I've had people make the DVD
archiving argument they're like oh well
DVDs only a couple cents I'm like okay
it only holds four gigs so you've got
like and how much is your time work
don't want to sit there burning like
like you said 80 blu-rays and then it's
not even it's not even easy to like
figure out what you've now written to
disk and which discus cuz okay think
about it this way if you're like wedding
video part 1 2 3 did you burn them in
chronological order did you burn them in
alphabetical order did you burn like the
pictures of the hot bridesmaids on the
one over there your wife wouldn't see it
like I don't know she watching this I
mean it's tech stuff like okay here's
another one why do you why do you bother
why do you bother updating a phone like
notepad app why do you bother writing a
special note pad app let's talk about
slicks phone because he loves his phone
so huggy much tell me about S note hey I
have a perfect note app though tell me
all about S note I want to give out s
note s why did Samsung write a notepad
application
what did Samsung write any of the
applications on that phone be nice okay
you've tried to use s note for what a
couple weeks yeah I was okay so oh did
you know that the memo pad that comes on
the iPhone works really well just text
input well that's what I want it okay to
be honest okay why did you start using s
note here we go
so I'm using a scope for the livestreams
if you guys see me or alliance when
we're all the streams forever looking at
our phones it's because we have certain
people watching the audience there's
certain people that are in the audience
that have our phone numbers that will
text us if things are going wrong like
audio Li yeah okay I do yeah your
friends don't care as much but I don't
have any friends that's the idea that's
unfortunate anyways
text me if there's audio problems that's
why I jump up sometimes I'll hear my
phone buzz and then just like dart over
and see if one of our buddies is texting
me saying there's an audio problem or
something um and because we keep our
notes there I'm looking at pictures of
the baby that got sent to me throughout
the day he's eating green beans it's
pretty cute sorry carry on we keep our
notes there for the last room so we
shouldn't think of topics so I was
trying to use s note man that was
frustrating
uh if I did like the slightest thing
wrong so we'd like go to a different tab
with an S note or anything like if I
clicked on anything that wasn't proper
it would move away from the stuff that I
was currently typing you just delete
everything oh my god so like we'd be on
a really long car ride somewhere and I'd
be like documenting all this stuff we're
thinking of it like googling up topics
that we can hopefully talk about the
last few is it boring as all hell and
then I've got a whole bunch of stuff and
I walk out of the car and like just
sleep my phone and put it in my pocket
go on open up later it's just like whoa
nope all your lines are removed the app
is still open but all your lines are
removed I'm just like why so I ended up
downloading some random happen don't
even what it's called it's called like
simple note or something so there's just
a white screen and like a list of the
documents that you have and you just
like click on them and then it brings up
just a white screen again and then you
can just like type wherever you want
it's like that's exactly what I wanted
all I wanted was a mirror of the notepad
app for PC and so that's all I wanted
but they had to add all this additional
functionality which barely works and
then the whole app barely works because
everything else barely works we have to
do our Windows 8 giveaway so you had a
question that you wanted to use as our
trivia so I'm gonna brief them on who's
sponsoring the giveaway in the meantime
while you go remember what it was okay
one second okay so guys the the Windows
8 giveaway is sponsored by Timmy Tech TV
so we're gonna go ahead and go to Timmy
Tech TVs YouTube channel and I'm going
to try to frickin get this going 9
youtube.com slash I can't find the slash
on this keyboard I've had a lot of
people ask me what keyboard this is and
it's some SEO one I actually don't
remember
it's KB 1 7 8 RT KB 1 7 8 RT it's not
perfect by any stretch of the
imagination but it works and it kind of
gets the job done and we really know I
don't want to stay on
this page go away what is this oh man
British Columbia mom makes 7,000 dollars
a month and you won't believe how she
does it
and it's not letting me leave there we
go
leave not sponsored by that sorry for
that guys Timmy tech TV there we go
Timmy tech TV channel so he has
sponsored us for copies of um look at
that he featured my channels on his
channel that was nice of him uh he's
he's sponsored me for copies of Windows
8 to give away on the next four
livestream so oh another thing guys
there won't be a live stream next week
because next week we will be in Vegas if
we manage to stream something on Friday
and oh no no by Friday night will be on
a plane slick yeah not gonna happen we
can't do it we can't do a live stream
over there
yeah that's not feasible he's giving me
that look like he really want he really
wants to live stream well when everybody
back I'm sorry back
oh we're not live streaming the night we
get back from CES if I can get
everything set up I'll drag him into a
chair but there's no promises I might be
I might look like this in the chair so
anyway have you have you managed to
figure this out yet okay okay guys so
the first one to tweet the correct
answer a hundred percent letter for
letter perfectly the correct answer to
slicks question here is the winner so
I'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna fire
up Twitter and here we go slick comeback
ask your question how do you watch a ski
Star Wars in Windows and we're looking
for like the legit way to do it not like
going on YouTube and searching for a ski
Star Wars yeah like how do you like how
do you do it
you can do this offline like how do you
like the whole thing it's it's seriously
okay let's see so the first one the
first one oh hold on we have at least
one correct answer there once you can
actually you have to be all mine okay
you have to be alright fine but like
that's not the point now there's no
where I'm trying to prove like you don't
have to open up browser okay here we go
so Wow
BAM Kevin knew the answer I did not
think that would be that easy
okay Kevin I am going to follow you on
twitter so that you can private message
me private message me you are getting a
free copy of Windows 8 congratulations
Timmy TAC TV is gonna send that to you
and you should be super thrilled because
it doesn't work in Windows 8 as well
apparently alright so you can go watch
your ASCII Star Wars and your brand-new
copy of Windows 8 thanks guys for
participating and I hope you found it to
be a little bit more organized this week
compared to last last week was a
disaster did you watch it I ended up
watching yeah it was terrible I just I
don't blame you though but like it was
bad I look ok that's why I tried to pick
something more structured you knew what
a long day I'd had that day already plus
I think you have a better understanding
now of how much I'm able to sleep at
night between my cat and my baby it is a
miracle that I get any rest at all let's
hope that the forum but yeah yeah yes
he'll perform indeed ok here we go sound
carton headset for 7.1 gaming first of
all get a proper bed phone or headset
with two speakers in it agreed yep 100%
agreed find some sound card that does
some cheese ball surround effect if you
really want that it will be better
it will honestly sound better I have
owned both and actual 7.1 doesn't sound
as good as really good high quality
headphones what's up my dream surround
software trickery is where it's at guys
remember guys two ears two speakers is
all you need and I know that question
was Google
but pretty much any question that we're
gonna be able to come up with is gonna
be Google and the people that answered
we're really clear yeah they were fast
enough that they probably knew they'd
probably just knew it and you'll always
be at an advantage if you actually know
the answer which is which is great guys
actually Oh have you done have you seen
that virtual haircut thing no no okay
mandatory mandatory assignment here guys
everyone needs to after the livestream
of course you need to stay and watch s
first search for virtual barbershop this
is I recognize this may be I have this
is all the evidence you need there it is
use headphones close your eyes and you
base oh yeah I have heard of this yes
definitely it sounds like you're getting
a haircut if you needed evidence that
you only have two ears and you only need
two speakers that is it so there you go
if you're in a home theater setting 7.1
is awesome
when when the speakers are directly
covering your entire ear it's it's so
cool though have you tried it
oh yeah definitely I thought you were
talking no no no I didn't know your
topic no it's so friggin cool yeah the
best thing ever
you should definitely go watch it all
right what do we got
and that's das also apparently it works
in ms-dos as well yeah it works in like
tons of stuff I think it might work in
Linux as well okay dude dude dude we
have one guy who answered star wars well
I guess that would be a way to watch
Star Wars in Windows very carefully yeah
offline mode in Safari apparently I
don't know how many people install
Safari on their Windows machines no yeah
I do download on iTunes and play through
QuickTime Justin you're fired
I like it though buy a CD
it wasn't the point guys these guys are
like trying to legit answers like the
question and it's like no no it's a it's
a trick it's like a trick question I
didn't want to say it was a command-line
input yeah cuz that's like yeah that's
too obvious yeah cuz you gonna say like
I wanted the Google search to be at
least not 100% straightforward by
getting a job and buying it yes the
extreme computing you are the winner of
tonight's live stream you don't get a
copy of Windows but you get our respect
all the internet cookies OMG slick is so
high and I think Julie isn't the only
girl who actually thinks so okay moving
on ahh
Oh big Nvidia announcement see yes okay
I'm kind of curious about this Deacon
usually tweets pretty good stuff live
from Las Vegas how to tune into in
videos news oh we're missing this we're
not gonna be there in time
so what Evers yeah we're going down on
the way let's Sunday no it's during the
day Sunday we don't arrive till Sunday
night so yeah we're missing we're
missing it there's like a live show it's
like a big event I have no idea what
they're what they're talking about but
it should be should be pretty cool maybe
it's the things to me I don't know it's
probably a lot bigger than that yeah the
GeForce experience is cool but I don't
think this is probably longer than that
yeah they're making like a really big
deal out of this what case 300 ro or 692
events
that's a 600 are cuz I meant to say 300
are yeah I saw that uh I feel 300 I
probably would just the more modern
feature set
just is a good thing I've built in the
300 armoire yeah which gives it kind of
an unfair advantage because I kind of
know it I only did a 692 advance build a
long time ago but it's a good case I
haven't built in one of Justino really
yeah no it's really good like it's easy
to build in everything's really
intuitive coolermaster does such a good
job of that no I know I know
just I've built in the 300 are a lot I
haven't built from the other one so
that's why I didn't actually ever give a
suggestion but I kind of would just lean
towards that one because that's only
when I have personal experience with
slick looks familiar
hey you could easily be out like a mesh
between these two guys and this one well
yes I might need a touch-up before we go
as well but I was okay yeah that's my
roommate I'm like I was planning to get
a haircut literally like three months
ago I'm just never Chris Barry wins all
the Internet's we have to take the
Internet's away from whoever won it last
time because that is the most creative
spelling of Wednesday I have ever seen
it is even a space it's not capitalized
like let's try to find how many things
are wrong with this it's not capitalized
there's a space there's a space the the
diamond the D and the N are reversed
there's a missing
there's a missing E okay it has like
Phoenician marks the sentence isn't
capitalized you don't need a like there
okay yo Chris we love you man
I have blitz bit casas infinite drive
I'm not familiar with that unfortunately
maybe we should look into that after
sure blu-ray burners for giving out
there's huge amounts of data without
giving them a whole hard drive and BD XL
is 125 games okay but how much does it
be the XL cost so that still holds with
sort of what we're saying and if I ever
give people huge amounts of data it's
usually not like here archived
is either like here take this really
quickly and I would use nayad I was
going yeah I would use a flash drive man
Oh use a flash drive or I would like FTP
it to them or I would use a Dropbox so
for the cost of your blu-ray discs to
match that to terabyte capacity you
could buy your two terabyte hard drive
and a big fat USB drive and rewritable
again yeah but then you could get like a
baller one like this that's impossible
to destroy survivor style win
they're pretty epic yeah like I I
understand he's trying to play that was
advocating he's trying to like spur the
conversation but I just still don't
think it's feasible
what's some in her name do you play and
what region do you plan on shout out to
Henry Pham yeah I back up my wii and ps2
games on you okay yes you can back up
your games on that's a legitimate reason
to have lost sort of legitimate reason
to have a bird here he's actually doing
it hey look at the color changes when I
switched these it's better on this one
see how yellow we look cuz you can have
different settings in the seats I know
but I think I must have messed up seen
one well we were in kind of a hurry in
my defense yeah I want to replace my to
see this is the problem that I have with
the case guys who don't use standard fan
sizes and I mean I know 200 mil and 160
ml and 180 ml and 2/3 year they're all
kind of standard fan sizes but I mean by
standard like someone actually makes
replacement fans for it yeah I'm
BitFenix is doing a good job of
supporting the fan sizes that they
generate and BitFenix fans look really
cool they're one of the only brands they
play for them okay yeah no I know
they're Prell kamee pros are good fans
I'm not saying they don't just like a
lot of people like how love noctua fans
but look at them and then put one beside
a big Phoenix fan and just like get a
thirteen-year-old kid to pick which one
he thinks is cool okay like the BitFenix
fans look awesome by that lot okay so
what I should make all the decisions in
my life based on what 13 year olds think
are cool do you have any of those in
your system they're like your favorite
fans do you have any of them in your
system
No
but they're the best come on you know
that come on why am I thinking you just
burned me I shouldn't be acknowledging
at all they just look at roches and like
okay do you have okay fine I will put an
F F 12 in the basement of my TJ o 7 in
the basement
it's keyword actually I won't bear okay
okay okay fine here let me put it this
way then yeah I was building it mmm I
was gonna say if I was building a
machine that had a closed side panel I'd
use them but my wife's machine does not
use not to us I have I have it aspects
with not to us on it that's the point of
the test page though isn't it to perform
really well no to report back sounds and
stuff for fans you're using a
consolidated fan format no no not that
ones no no the other test bench power
supply oh we don't reduce that one we do
sometimes it has P twelves on it we use
that we used it for months we used that
test bench almost explicit for month
because no not almost exclusively
because I needed another test bench and
you said here's a bunch of hardware bill
deployment I grabbed those fans no I
changed no no you don't remember because
I changed them out when I was trying to
do acoustic testing on video cards I
needed fans that could run near-silent
on the actual CPU cooler itself so that
I could take sound readings from the
video card on an overclocked CPU system
without the CPU fans ramping up like
crazy they are the best fans but you
didn't care about the look of it because
it was on a performance based test bench
but if it was a choice between these and
ones that didn't perform well at all I
would go with source yeah nope I I love
not to a fans I just can't bring myself
to install an oi system because there
are but a p120 ones I like
they look great before 90% is good
gentle typhoons
you could argue as good but I wouldn't
run them at those kinds of rpms so I
would take a knock to over gentle
typhoons to be perfectly honest gentle
sigh dudes don't look that great but I
think they look better than gelid wings
aren't that great but they're pretty
good and they look really look really
good movie UV blue and my system is like
awesome ok there was someone I promised
to do
I there was someone I promised to do a
shout-out to this week and I gotta go I
gotta go check I don't know what to do Q
name I forget how to do it ah noobs can
play shout out shout out to noobs can
play peace bro when I cooked we're not
going to talk about problems with the
search function on NC X's website mine
it says have you heard about vortex bass
video no no I've never heard of this I
use my iphone notes bad notes app all
the time
that's one thing I do have a problem
with is the Notes app on iOS products is
kind of awesome and I have a lot of
problems with the one on my Android but
then like I said I downloaded a new one
which is an awesome thing about Android
and then it totally solved the problem
okay we have another Samsung topic to
discuss the evolution kit you mentioned
this but so did you two so this is this
is some CES news they first unveiled
this last year so the evolution kit get
this this face should give you some idea
how stupid I think this is oh it's
already kind of like the evolution kit
allows you to take your 2012 model Smart
TV and buy a pack to the back of it to
meet the ongoing you know memory and
processing power requirements of Smart
TVs and the media and everything that
you can upgrade your 2012 Smart TV to
the 2013 version by putting this pack on
the back I feel like if I was in the
store I would buy it just so you would
go so you get the latest suite of
applications you get why do you need a
pack for applications well this is the
first question that I was sort of
thinking okay continue sorry
well I guess actually no my first
question is why do you need a smart TV
at all why don't you buy a pillow say Oh
sin and hook it up to your TV unlike any
older firmware updates are free Oh 100%
and I've heard a lot of problems with
the gestures okay do you remember that
Samsung all-in-one that we had an
unboxing of yeah I tried to demo the
gesture thing I didn't get a single bit
of usable footage it just doesn't work
and the gestures on the TV at the
keynote at the Samsung Canada thing the
guy on stage was trying to demo it and
it didn't work at all
gestures are going to be incredible when
they work really well here's the thing
to actually build in the hardware that
would be required to properly map the
human body in any kind of remotely
reasonable real time and I'm not talking
connect with like you know a half second
delay okay it's not a half second but
with it with any kind of lag or any kind
of ambiguity as to what you're doing for
it to actually work perfectly so that it
can recognize you whether you're
standing like this or whether you're
like you know on the couch like this but
I mean it would basically need a
computer in it and like there's a lot of
little companies and some bigger
companies making some really interesting
hand gesture mat programs for computer
and stuff but there's still tons of
problems with them tons of problems I
mean the closest I think will be is like
a glove have you seen have you seen that
like weird crazy multi-coloured glove I
know I haven't seen my camera what
they're cold but it looks like you like
spilled a whole much different colored
paints on a glove okay and they wear
them and the gestures you can do with
them are insanely accurate okay see
something like that could work and guys
please for the love of peanuts stop
asking us if we heard about the leap
motion yes we have heard about the leap
motion
it's cool it is not out yet I cannot
unbox it yet I have been in touch with
them we're gonna arrange to get
something going once they actually have
units that they can ship but yeah I'm
super excited about it I think this
could be bridging the gap between the
touchscreen interface and the totally
not touchscreen you know for those folks
who don't want to touch their screen for
folks who are too far away from their
monitor and this is uncomfortable they
could still come up and go like this if
it works been like awesome it should be
really cool otherwise you know we'll all
forget about it at some point
apparently s note is really good on the
note 2 because of s-pen support that's
kind of cool to hear but doesn't help
all the incredible amount of s3 or easin
which by the way is more than any other
smartphone ever BAM so like that's
awesome
and I'm happy it works good for you and
s-pen is pretty cool but like there was
ability you know that's what I was
trying to just pick a really big number
do you think it's the transparent Oh
Ellie do you display they were showing a
while back no cuz if they've shown it
before I kind of doubt it yeah because
they're talking about like whole new
design and like shape of the TV and
stuff so unless they took of that and
shaped it differently I am building an X
79 rig now and slick runs a z77 rig now
so I guess both of us will be waiting
for the next chipset before we make any
upgrades I use Blu ray for backing up my
blu-ray movies no you should use a hard
drive for black backing up your blu-ray
movies ok sorry if you tweet that many
times I'm gonna have to skip oh yes we
are gonna have an X for you next 16 a
review comparison and conclusion we
haven't had time we're going to use the
standardized test bench I'm actually
gonna have to do some fancy dribbling to
make the X 60 fit in it but that's okay
we're gonna do it so yeah we will do
that but it'll be once we get back from
CES yeah Nick
I am very sorry if I'm pronouncing your
name wrong yeah Nick can you
oh okay so I don't know probably not for
an incredibly long time but if you're
interested in that kind of stuff Google
up oculus rift it's the closest thing we
may be getting in the near future
they're awesome look it up can you order
them are you talking about which which
one easily dies sorry you those are
totally totally different things in
every possible way no I wouldn't really
recommend a GT 640 anything under a
hundred bucks for a graphics card is not
a good value and I don't mean it's not
cheap it is cheap but it's not a good
value because value is I I think of in
terms of frames per second per dollar
I actually got someone giving me a
really hard time on on Twitter because I
wouldn't recommend the GT or a GTX 650
to someone and I was like GTX 650 is not
a good value I said I and they're like
oh Lavina it's not everyone you know
blah blah blah can get the best card and
you guys are so focused on gtx 660ti is
a succes well no actually it's you can
get a 650 TI but the difference in
performance between a 650 and a 650 Ti
is like this and the difference in price
is like this value is FPS per dollars
not just dollars so a 640 is never a
good value because it costs like 80% of
what something way better costs but will
perform like half as well so it's a
terrible terrible value never buy
entry-level video cards you got to look
into the price for performance yeah
curves and like if you're behind like a
card like that it's gonna be obsolete so
quick yeah
do you know where I can buy modded cases
I don't know I mod them myself by dremel
and some like panels from Home Depot or
wherever you buy okay
Home Depot stuff well I think that wraps
it up for now thank you guys for tuning
in to our shortened livestream hopefully
two weeks from now when we do the next
livestream you guys will be
to tune in on time because we'll be like
ready and I'm sure we'll have tons more
topics it's fun I had lately because
everyone's just kind of calm before the
storm ring because I see yes yeah so
we're gonna have way way too much stuff
to talk about
yeah instead of just like right now if I
do like it deluxe like longer livestream
or something maybe we'll talk about it
in the in the cool-down from CES we'll
plan low like one like a debriefing
maybe we do like a three or five hour
livestream or something like that as
long as we get a huge list of comments I
mean topics and people are willing to
come around I'm cool with it yeah okay
all right good night guys thanks for
tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
