is the popcorn our c200 this is the
brand-new networked media tank from
popcorn our these things just landed so
we're finally shipping them so I'm
really excited to be able to bring you
this unboxing the first thing you might
notice and I'll use a there is an
external hard drive for size comparison
this thing is huge
the box is like way oversized I know
because we had to air ship these things
in to make sure that we had stock right
away okay first of all let's have a look
at the back so the chipset most
important thing about the popcorn our
it's using a sigma designs chipset so
awesome so they haven't changed the
design from that perspective they do
have a full list well probably not a
full list but an extensive list of all
of the different media files that are
supported all the video decoders all the
audio containers all that good stuff all
the web services so you can even do
where was it you can even have a Usenet
downloader on here so it does BitTorrent
Usenet UPnP all that kind of
connectivity Ethernet Gigabit now as
opposed to the 10 100 that was on the
old a 200 and Ra 100 110 one of those
the old popcorn our oh you know what
let's get this open because I'm kind of
failing at reading the box there so open
up the top just like this and then open
up this side and open up these two sides
and let's just flip it over and slide
out the popcorn our C $200 one of the
big changes they've made with the C 200
is that it now has support for an
optical drive so what that means is you
can actually install a blu-ray drive in
the popcorn era now
so first let's have a look at the Quick
Start Guide so this is for setting up
your C 200 shows you everything that
should come with it which we'll have a
look at in a minute so we don't need to
talk about that too much shows who you
want to connect the HDMI cable install
the antenna for the RF remote control
that's cool that it comes with an RF
remote control the old one was infrared
and it you know I mean infrared remotes
are never perfect but this is non
directional so you can use it when
you're pointing it anywhere and then you
just do the RF control matching to make
sure that they are synced up awesome
okay so let's
we've got four accessories so you got
kind of a brown paper bag like a lunch
bag here and that has your accessories
in it so here is your Quick Start Guide
okay so it's about about yay big and
it's giving you the basics of setting up
your home server where you're gonna pull
all of your network data off of to watch
media on your popcorn our okay Oh some
last-minute notes due to the short time
to market some features may not be
available but will be enabled in future
firmware updates now this is a big thing
that popcorn our does is they do support
their products for a very long time they
have huge user support as well as really
good support from popcorn hours so you
can expect them to actually add the
features that they say they're gonna add
even if it's not feature complete when
it ships so here we go HDMI cable looks
like a six foot HDMI cable its sleeve
looks quite nice
then you've got your double-a batteries
here's your no no those are triple A's
sorry triple-a batteries for the remote
and then we've got a power cable so it's
just your standard PC three prong power
cable okay nothing's particularly
interesting about that
here is the RF antenna just like that
little guy okay and then next inside
here we've got four fan screws where I
was what they appear to be although
they're probably for something else and
then for other small screws which are
threaded for an optical drive so we can
tell what that's for that's for the
blu-ray drive should you choose to
install it now here's the remote the
remote is quite a bit more advanced
looking even than the original popcorn
our remote which was quite good it's got
a bit of a glossy finish to it here and
you can tell from the from the way the
buttons are yeah whatever you can tell
from the buttons that they are backlit
so you'll be able to use this in the
dark no problem so that's it for the
accessories let's get the popcorn our
itself out of the protective foam knees
here it's extremely well packed you can
see we've got more than an inch of foam
around it on all sides so there's no way
this thing's gonna get damaged in
shipping
here it is so this is quite a bit bigger
than the old popcorn hour this is like
the size of well I mean it's about the
size of a blueberry planner I guess so
you put that right in your home theater
here so let's have a look at just what
we can show here so let's have a look at
the front first you've got a hot swap
Bay so that's where you can install a
three and a half inch hard drive if you
want but you can also see the border
around here you can also take that whole
thing out and install a blu-ray drive
here you've got your menu navigation
from the front dim TV mode two USB ports
on the front power button as well as an
LCD just or round to the side there
you've got some ventilation for the hard
drive alright then let's keep going
around so here at the back here's where
you plug in the RF antenna for the
remote here's where you can install what
appears to be a 60 millimeter fan it
might be 40 mil it's hard to eyeball
that I've got HDMI here's IR then you've
got digital audio out in both formats
optical and coax 2 more USB ports
Ethernet port s-video component as well
as composite and then you've got your
power in it accepts either north
american standard or european asian
standard power and you've got your
on/off switch so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the popcorn hour and
i think that based on that we did a
popcorn hour tech tips last time around
i think this definitely deserves a tech
tips well let's have a look at the menu
and just how well this thing works
because this is the Cadillac of network
media players</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
