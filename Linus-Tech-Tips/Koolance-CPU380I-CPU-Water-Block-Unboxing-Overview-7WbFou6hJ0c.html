description to learn more about the a
data - drive air AE 400 welcome to a
product unboxing that won't be
interesting to you if you're not into
liquid cooling but if you are then it
should be pretty interesting to you this
is the coolants 380 ICP you cooler and
what makes it 380 is the fact that it is
their current generation CPU water block
and what makes it I is that this is the
Intel variant so coolants usually does a
great job of their included instructions
and this is no exception even though
this is just printed out with what
appears to be an inkjet printer it's
full color and does seem to outline
exactly what you need to do this
particular block mounts on LGA 775 1155
1156 1150 2011 and 1366 however for some
other boards you may need an adapter
plate it has yes there we go all of the
below included in the box so there is a
backplate another more different
backplate a silicon isolator so this one
right here will keep the backplate from
shorting out any of the components on
your board if you have a board that that
would be a risk for it includes 2011
mounting pegs so you can see those will
screw right into the built-in backplate
around the edge of your LGA 2011 board
it also includes tension hold down for
presumably all of the other Intel socket
so those go right there a ginormous tube
of thermal goop cool ants branding on it
okay as well as a bunch of others okay
well those are all the knickknacks
nothing ok so let's go ahead and move
along to the 2 ounce block coolants for
me was always about fit and finish now
back in the day they weren't necessarily
a performance leader by any stretch of
the imagination but that was a long time
ago these days the 380 is a
top-of-the-range block in terms of the
performance and they're still
maintaining that fit and finish so it
used to be they did weird stuff like
gold plating and it looked fantastic man
did it look good on the bottom of the
block but gold actually isn't as good a
thermal conductor as
some other metals and while it didn't
really hurt performance it certainly
didn't help it and that seems to be what
they were going for was oh you know
gold-plated for best done what kind of
no no no no so copper and silver are
both actually better conductors than
gold these days they still have that
mirror shine finish so we'll go ahead
and do that obligatory finger shot where
you can see how reflective that bad boy
is see I can see you right there in the
camera it's got a bit of a bow to the
base this has been in fashion ever since
the release of the detection I believe
it was the fusion v1 that initially had
the bode base with a with a custom oring
you could add to it so it has a slightly
bowed base this allows for it to flatten
out once it is actually applied to the
block and that smoothness at the ball
actually that that shininess at the
bottom doesn't necessarily affect
performance but it certainly looks nice
it's a copper base block so it uses a
micro thin arrangement with a mid plate
that I don't think you can actually
quite see but there's an intake block or
there's an intake feed right there so
there's a mid plate and then there are
micro fins on the bottom and then it
uses a very very very thick hold down
plate that's one of the thickest hold
down plates I've ever seen you're going
to be able to apply as much or as little
pressure as you want however it should
be noted that you don't want to risk
damaging your motherboard for the sake
of getting really good mounting pressure
between your block and the motherboard
itself coolants has configured this
block so that it will be compatible with
pretty much whatever G 1/4 standard
fittings that you want to use even if
they are 1/2 inch ID 3/4 inch OD
fittings which is often hard to fit on
something like a CPU block so Swift X
approach is that they often allow you to
user config the inlet to move it away
from the other one and this gives you a
bit more flow restriction and maybe a
little bit less performance but allows
you to fit bigger fittings this one
supports it out of the box no problem
there also clearly labeled inlets outlet
and I think that pretty much wraps it up
other than to show you what the block
will look like on your board if you
happen to have an Asus z87 deluxe so
there you go man I love water cooling
probably the best thing about it is just
the sheer sex appeal of it thank you for
