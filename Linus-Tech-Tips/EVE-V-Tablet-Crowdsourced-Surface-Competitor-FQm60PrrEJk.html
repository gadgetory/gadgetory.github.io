5 but none of our complaints about the
surface pro 4 ended up being addressed
so we actually didn't end up making a
video about it like seriously guys how
does it not have thunderbolt 3 but you
know what maybe none of that matters
meet the Eevee a crowdfunding and
crowdsourcing success story that on
paper has created a surface like device
with amazing specs
not to mention better i/o and at a lower
price today's video is brought to you by
Mac Weldon Mac Weldon believes in smart
design premium fabrics and simple

we don't normally talk about the
packaging much but the Eevee's box
features the names of everyone that
contributed to its creation that is over
a thousand people and we thought that
that was pretty cool as for the tablet
itself it both looks and feels very
similar to the surface pro which is a
really good thing the whole device is
completely free of branding with a
stealthy black aluminum finish and we
are definitely fans of the aesthetic on
the right side we have one USB type a
connector and a micro SD slot and then
on the Left we've got really holy crap
okay so we mentioned Thunderbolt 3
already but there is a second type C
port another type a port and a headphone
jack for good measure I mean this
thing's got as much I owe as some decent
sized laptops and then on the subject of
things included the keyboard and the
stylus both come bundled so you don't
have to worry about buying them
separately for internal hardware our
model sports a dual core Intel Core i7 7
y 75 16 gigs of ddr3 memory and a 512
gig SSD the heat from all of which is
dissipated by a passive heatsink that's
built into the chassis now at first our
CPU turbo-boosted all the way up to
three point three gigahertz
then it got very hot very fast and
decided that that was a bad idea and
dropped to just under 2 gigahertz with
temps in the mid 60s so what this means
is that bursty loads like web browsing
will feel really snappy but you won't
get the full power of your processor for
a longer tasks like rendering video some
people may find that the core i5 model
with 8 gigs of RAM is more appropriate
since it's less expensive and should
throttle less the keyboard is a little
quirky there's an evil ogo on the V key
and oops instead of a backspace but that
shouldn't take away anything from the
damn nice typing experience and 7 color
RGB backlighting is a nice little
it isn't quite on the same level as the
surface pro I don't trust the durability
of eaves Alcantara quite as much as
Microsoft's polyurethane coated
Alcantara and the keycaps feel a bit
more plasticky but it still retains the
excellent ki feel and travel distance of
the surface and while you're typing
that's what matters most putting it
right up there then with the best
notebook keyboards that we've used the
trackpad isn't quite as amazing it's a
little small and although the tracking
is good the click becomes stiffer and
then stops clicking at all as you get
towards the top of the pad so be -
execution there but fortunately you'll
be using the touchscreen a fair bit
since it's fantastic find things like
selecting mistyped words or navigating
webpages work exactly like you'd want
them to and the panel looks great it's
anti-glare coating makes it look a
little less sharp than the surface even
though it's resolution is marginally
higher but we actually didn't mind this
trade-off since tablets with less glare
is something that the world actually
needs more of and with the out of the
box display calibration any kind of
content looks fantastic no best buy TV
syndrome here and it sounds good too
the speakers are louder than you'd
expect which should help set the mood
for Netflix sing with a friend but the
stone but the Eevee is not without its
trade-offs all that extra i/o takes up
the space where the stylus attaches to
the surface pro meaning that you're left
with a fairly flimsy magnetic mount that
falls down quicker than a southern kid
taking his first step into the Canadian
winter and while we're at it the stylus
is good but not great it's fine for
note-taking but it fails to achieve that
pen to paper feel of the surface pro so
if your primary use is going to be using
the stylus or art creation and Evi gen 2
or something might be worth waiting for
the webcam on the Eevee lacks IR
emitters and therefore windows hello
support but it's above average and for
most people the fingerprint sensor and
the power button is a very reasonable
alternative
I actually don't understand why more PC
makers haven't done this it's a great
idea as for battery life well it's not
the best we've seen but we've also got
the top spec model and you can still be
productive for a pretty long time
without a wall outlet so this is a
really great machine and that is
ignoring the biggest selling point the
price the surface pro does feel like the
more pro option of the two with the
webcam and the stylus in particular
setting it apart but given that the i5
model of the Eevee which comes with a
stylus and the keyboard cover is 370
fewer US dollars than the equivalent
surface pro unless you are heavily
relying on the stylus something that I'm
sure many of you do not we think the
Eevee it's kind of a no-brainer so great
job guys projects like this show us how
crowdsourcing and crowdfunding can be
good things in the right hands speaking
of things that are good in the right
hands tunnel there let tunnel bear take
care of keeping your internet connection
private and secure now one of the things
to look for when you're shopping for a
VPN is a feature called a kill switch
because before your device connects to a
network it actually starts to send
information about itself and what it
wants to do and it tries to establish
connections with all sorts of things and
there are lots of devices trying to
connect to yours
well a kill switch stops this from
happening before you connect to your VPN
all the traffic is actually unencrypted
so in the few seconds that it takes to
connect you've probably already
broadcast your IP a few DNS requests or
even a search query Vigilant bear from
tunnel bear stops all of this from
happening and what's great is that if
your connection goes down for some
reason vigilant bear will kick back in
and stop all outbound and inbound
traffic till the connection comes back
so for a free trial of tunnel bear go to
tunnel bear comm /l tt we've got that
