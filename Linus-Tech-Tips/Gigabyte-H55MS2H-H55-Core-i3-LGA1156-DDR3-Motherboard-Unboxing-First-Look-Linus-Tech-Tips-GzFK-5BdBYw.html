too long to get started on unboxing the
age 55 motherboards that are available
to me but I'm gonna get started today
we've got the H 55 m s 2 H this is a
gigabyte board it has their 3 year
standard warranty as well as a host of
other features now this is an LGA 1156
board ok supports Core i5 and core i3
has an 855 chipset blah blah blah HDMI
DVI now what's interesting about those
two things is that they only work if
you're using a core i3 or a Core i5 dual
core as of the time of filming this so
even though you've actually got support
for the core i5 quad cores as well as
the core i7 quad cores on LGA 1156 you
cannot use the onboard video if you're
using one of those processors so the
reason for that is that the onboard
video is actually on the CPU it is not
on the motherboard chipset so this is
the fairly low-end board we're gonna get
started here we've got a user's manual
inside Windows 7 support awesome good to
see all right then you've got your your
driver installation DVD now this is very
strange they've got like features on
here that this board totally doesn't
have which threw me off when I first
opened this it does not have their 3-3-3
onboard acceleration it does not have
ultra-durable 3 ok that's like a very
strange thing anyway don't use that DVD
download the latest drivers off the
gigabyte website so then you've got your
smart 6 the smart way for PC system
management it's got a bunch of utilities
and whatnot ok then you've got a
multilingual installation guidebook
ok so a bunch of different languages
shows you how to install the CPU how to
install Ram pretty good stuff ok then
you have an IDE cable and 2 SATA cables
that is it for the cables included with
this board and then you have an i/o
shield ok that was micro ATX board it's
a fairly low-end board so you're not
gonna find a lot of the high-end
features now the age 55 is kind of like
a cut-down p55 in some ways so it has
all the same basic support you've got
support for the LGA 1156 socket you've
got support for dual channel ddr3 you've
got support for PCI Express
sixteen x times one now this board see
this is a PCI Express 8x port you can
see that it's oh no this is a for export
it's an 8 X port with 4 ok so this is
not a crossfire ready board even though
they've got a plastic 16 X slot here
it's actually only wired for 4 X so you
wouldn't get satisfactory crossfire
support even though they do have a
crossfire logo here so it will run but
if you're running any kind of decent
high end cards it's not gonna get the
best performance mind you if you're
running crossfire with decently high-end
cards why are you buying this board
anyway you've got your voltage
regulators here so the no extra cooling
nothing like that
alright let's just have a look at what
we do have on this board stop talking
about what it doesn't have we spilled on
a floppy port got a couple USB headers
there's your front panel connectors
right there you've got six data two
ports no SATA three ports are included
with this board okay despite what it
said on the driver disk the 24 for the
24 pin power connectors on the right
hand edge of the board and it's desired
place along with an IDE port and then up
at the top of the board you've got your
four pin power so this board does not
have an eight pin power connector
because I guess they figure you just
don't need it with the kind of chips you
should be putting in this board you've
only got two slots for ddr3 so that
means you're gonna be limited to a
practical maximum of eight gigs if you
can afford four gig dims at this time
which will likely go down in price but
it is gonna be a bit of a limitation for
some users okay then on the back we've
got a ps2 keyboard mouse combo port I
really like these then we have eight USB
2.0 ports no USB 3.0 ports and then we
have three video outputs one VGA one DVI
and one HDMI please note you cannot use
these outputs they are just dead
connections unless you are running a
core i3 or a Core i5 dual core with
integrated graphics on the CPU okay then
we've got onboard optical audio out
onboard Gigabit LAN and 7.1 audio thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
gigabyte Gah 55m s2h</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
