the entire MSI p55 lineup this is our
last video with the p55 at GD 80 this is
their flagship p55 board you can tell
because it actually oh there goes
another part okay you can tell because
the extreme speed is actually shiny they
have a better quality boxes that
cameraman pointed out to me so let's get
this thing open here we go so starting
with the quick guide this is actually a
pretty nice looking a little quick guide
that shows you everything about this
board I mean we're gonna show you the
board in a minute so we don't need to
spend much time on this but we thought
it was a pretty cool addition it's in
like eight different languages which is
pretty sweet okay so here we go this is
a huge accessory package so we've got
okay crossfire bridge here we'll just go
through these in order crossfire bridge
we have a huge sli bridge that's the
longest that's the lie bridge I've seen
we have two more SLI bridges okay
and we've got an IO shield we've got
your usual drivers and MSI extra CDs
harddrive backup user guide here's the
quick installation guide and MSI winky
again okay MSI winky then we've got the
OC Genie guide as well and then the
regular motherboard manual so there you
go there's a lot of stuff on that side
and then we've got an eSATA bracket
along with with a SATA 2 molex power
adapter that's pretty cool and then
we've got oh this is neat this is the
little adapters to do the direct voltage
readouts right from your motherboard so
we'll show you what these plug into in
just a minute those are really cool
though then we've got these little
bricks so that you can easily plug
things into them and then plug the
entire brick right into the board
tons of SATA cables a bunch of molex to
SATA adapters IDE cable and then we've
got a USB IO panel it's a huge accessory
package that comes with this board very
impressive so here we have it the GD 80
this is the cream of the cream for MSI's
p55 motherboards let's get it out of the
box here and if I could just figure out
how to do that and we'd be moving right
along
more trucks going by we really didn't
choose this location very well that was
bad planning but there you go so we've
got OC Genie sticker and the extreme
speed which includes dr. moss and the
super pipe super pipe basically means
that it's got a ridiculously thick heat
pipe running from the chipset up to the
dr. Moss MOSFETs if you actually look
from this angle you can see just how
huge this thing is it's kind of
ridiculous so then other than that
you've got your usual stuff for a p55
motherboard so you've got your four dims
your LGA 1156 socket I shouldn't say oh
yeah I should say p55 but you can't just
say Core i5 because there is a core i7
or a couple models of core i7s for the
socket so then we've got our power
connector up here for the eight pin and
then way over here for the 24 pin in
their usual locations we've got eight
SATA ports we've got our base clock
adjustment buttons and then a couple
features that this has that are unique
are a the LCD readout here
so that's your postcode and then these
are actually touch sensitive power reset
and green power buttons I'm not sure
what green power does yet but we'll get
into that more later in our overclocking
guide actually is this the first time
I've referenced it we do have an
overclocking guide that we'll be
releasing for the p55 and the new LGA
1156 Core i5 and core i7 CPUs now last
thing about this board let's talk about
the expansion ports a little bit so
we've got three PCIe 16x slots but only
two of them are gonna be actually
running at 16x one of them should be a
4x slot and then on the back we've got
our i/o so you can see here we've got
ps2 digital audio firewire a couple USB
and then we've got one of those neat
esata/usb combo ports a few more USB 2
gigabit ethernet and 7.1 audio thank you
