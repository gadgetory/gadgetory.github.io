who's playing banjo bingo out there
space you're welcome
we didn't give it home last week yeah I
know we were on time last weekend I got
the least amount of like success
screenshots sent to my Twitter last week
any other week because I think people
are used to getting that free spot
terrible um so yeah we've had a really
interesting week can we do floatplane
news can we tell people what's gonna
happen next week I want it to just
happen it's actually I forgot to ask you
in our little meeting I wanted to ask
you how we were gonna deal with it in
terms of communication so is this how
you want it
I want two people to know you want a pre
now I want to tell the people tell the
people but what if it doesn't work then
they're gonna know that we told them
what our plan was and that our plan
ultimately fell through which will be a
huge surprise to only a very small
percentage of them okay that's very well
we plan on launching the what is going
on here I don't know I just
no one's supposed to touch this set
between Friday you did
I didn't replace some monitor I spent a
while be like what is wrong with the
Saturday I didn't replace the monitor
okay I just took the monitor I did not
actually put a new one there literally
no actually that was actually not true
right but what you corrected me with was
worse anyways next week sometime on
Wednesday let's say definitely by
Thursday although time zones so who
knows but sometime on Wednesday for sure
so if you check too early it might not
be there but whatever sometimes do it I
just liked watching you freak out uh
we're launching the Alpha of the
floatplane website meaning you'll be
able to sign up for an account directly
through that website you'll be able to
pay for it with credit card that's new
you won't be able to pay for it with
PayPal which is hilarious if you want
you to PayPal you have to go back it do
the four that will be fixed brain trees
being really good people in case anyone
from Braintree is watching we need to
stay on their good side
yeah um so right now just credit card
and you'll be able to watch videos there
you'll be able to comment won't be able
to reply to people a little get rekt
that'll come but yeah this will be the
first time that you'll be able to do
everything on the new website you won't
need form integration you can just go
there pay for a subscription watch there
all that kind of stuff so to everyone
out there who said that floatplane was
never gonna launch because Luke's an ID
MN and also it's a bad idea so that you
know compounded the issue in their minds
and also that the way that we recruited
developers was really dumb making a
video and then publishing it on a tech
channel super dumb so in response to
everyone who ever said anything about
that I got this for you
and demonetised this is why we need
floatplane yeah uh oh let's roll the
intro yeah
we should replace my part instead of
like clenching in the thing that should
be like flying and then like something
goes wrong and then I'm able to land on
the water you know
yeah floatplane the site where middle
fingers are totally allowed yeah it's
completely because they're totally okay
then yeah nobody nobody's gonna mind all
right so technically yeah oh oh oh okay
so this is interesting
do we want to jump right into the Intel
discrete GPU we can or considering we're
talking about flow plating right now we
can just talk about what's on full plane
right now it's up to you oh we need that
later up to you sir I wasn't listening
because I was checking my notes I have I
have some notes from dr. Contras my
favorite writer over at a non tech yeah
about this topic so I'm just gonna jump
into it I didn't hear what you said and
I'm sorry it's cool hosted by 2004
thanks um are you gonna do quit done the
original article hears from tech power
up intel unveils discrete GPU prototype
development yeah so it wasn't that long
ago that AMD made a high profile hire
Roger koduri AMD's former head of Radeon
technologies group but clearly so
there's a there's a bunch of stuff here
so there's like there's like this got
like a block diagram which is really
interesting there's what looks like sort
of a mock-up of what a die shop might
look like like there's a bunch of what
looks like very internal information and
a lot of people are extrapolating a
bunch of information about the
suppose it 14 nanometer dedicated GPU
and so dr. cutter is actually
proactively because ian do you really
not you know believe in our
fact-checking makes point where we would
you know dig through all these diagrams
and figure out the misinterpretation
that other sites you know might have
accidentally made here do you really not
believe that we're capable of that I
appreciate it because you know thank you
for covering our butts because we were
not capable of that he proactively
reached out because he was sure that we
were going to talk about this and I'm
just gonna read it I'm not gonna read it
because he put it better than I could
have it's almost like he's a
professional writer or something just
wanted to poke about the Intel discrete
GPU hullaballoo that's been going around
this week that might end up in Rancho
Everywhere is quoting it as a discrete
GPU prototype but that is because of a
slight miss reading of the Japanese
article source okay leave it to dr.
coutras to figure to pick out the slight
miss reading of the Japanese article
while it uses Intel graphics the chip is
actually a test design for a better
dynamic voltage frequency system
implementation applicable to a wide
range of chips view GPU and FPGA it was
done in a GPU core because it was an
easy design on 14 nanometer to start
with the Japanese article from which the
translation comes when Auto translated
does state that it's a discrete GPU
prototype but the author of who's very
very well respected and knowledgeable go
to San clarifies this point in the
second paragraph by seeing it was only a
vehicle for was actually being announced
and tested and the fact that it was
built on the GPU was inconsequential
okay so basically no in the well I don't
know has it been two months since Roger
got higher didn't tell no in the last
however many weeks it's been he has not
built a GPU yeah necessarily yeah you
might have I don't know he's kind of
amazing but um he has not and this is
like some power and clock management
stuff that might end up in that GPU but
might not but probably would but might
not it sounds like Raja and whatever
team he has is probably just playing so
so yeah there you go
this is yeah like it like it says test
vehicle not a future product it sounds
like they're just playing around so
let's go through our notes with all of
that in mind let's go through the notes
that we had based on other tech press is
reporting the first 14 nanometer
dedicated GPU prototype is a two chip
solution the first contains the GPU
itself in the system agent the second is
an FPGA that interfaces with the system
bus it's 1.5 billion transistors so in
videos GP 102 is built on 16 nanometer
and has 12 billion but but keep in mind
none of this really matters yes because
yeah
and following media speculation about
the slides until I stated that they
presented a research paper exploring new
circuit techniques optimized for power
management and actually you know what
kudos to James he had it right he had
all the clarifications in here it is a
test vehicle only not a future product
us much ado hold involved you guys can
see James's notes
credit to James good job James good job
James good job James you'll you'll you
know whether you like it or not you'll
have to work here another day because
you're not allowed to leave actually
wait no no James I have not added James
to my soul collection yet that's that's
my internal joke as soon as people buy a
house and get a mortgage then I kind of
cackle and I go like see Brenda
Brendan's listening yeah that's right
Brandon you know what's up you guys know
what I don't own yet there's many
reasons why but yeah but I would like to
to be correct yeah yeah so ha ha ha
Brandon says he hates me and just make
in case the microphone didn't pick it up
we're just getting that out that gives
you my soul if I wasn't an American
have you been to Brandon's place yet yes
super nice it is actually releasing hey
did you notice the amount of like random
little storage Abbi things I think have
unique it's probably less than it feels
like it probably feel
like a lot to you cuz I know your place
has like none closet yeah don't don't
give me that none it has a closet it has
a closet it has a closet that also has
the central vac and oh no that doesn't
care you can't put anything in there I'm
talking about under the stairs yeah I'm
talking about under the stairs is that
where the central vac is oh yeah yeah
there's technically closet door yeah so
yeah so compared to Luke's place yeah
but I think Brandon's gonna run out of
storage but what I like about it is that
Brandon how much can I talk about your
place okay cool um so unlike other town
houses what's really cool about it is
it's a little bit wider so it doesn't
feel yeah as much like living on a ship
or like yeah like in a sliver yeah yeah
yeah like it feels more like like like
the rooms feel more square instead of
like every room had to be kind of like
like put in front of the other room and
like kind of made it like a me a row of
them and and it even has it has side by
side parking yep which is sick for a
town house it was it was weird when I
went in it when I went to go park there
that if you want to park in the driveway
you don't fit but then there is also
side by side parking and like a really
nice garage and he's right next to the
visitor parking which is super cool it's
literally right there sense and there's
more coming in apparently there's like
six more visitor spots coming in soon so
yeah it's it's it's pretty nice it's
it's pretty dope there's I like it a lot
there's at least three different places
that you could put a BBQ and you'd be
out there barbecuing and you'd feel
pretty good about it
so you know that's an important thing
that that is an important metric is it
not someone randomly posted in here
lioness fact of the day Linus was born
in western Pennsylvania before moving to
Canada at the age of five
sure let's go with that um nice so so I
don't remember where I was going with
this but Brandon's house is sweet and I
got to see it did we get there I don't
know and that's the beauty of this show
the bane of this show oh no you're
talking about James and capturing his
soul oh yeah I haven't captured his soul
yet yeah
but I have captured quite a few souls
now I'm feeling pretty good about it
it's like you you guys you guys can't
leave me think about it like a mortgage
it is it's like it's like basically
getting married it's it's like I think
it's like potentially more hard yeah I
think it's actually more difficult to
get out of than a marriage if you isn't
that crazy
now if we think about sort of the
traditional values of of marriage even
that applicable anymore which well no no
I just mean but no look if we go back to
back to the whole till death do us part
let's focus on that part like if we call
that sort of the the tradition of of
marriage wow it's really eroded a lot oh
yeah point where like 50% fail or
something
I I don't I don't know what it is but
like we take a mortgage a car lease like
I think it's it's pretty hard to break a
car lease isn't it like you can't just
be like yeah you know um
Northshore Auto Group and I have
irreconcilable differences about 40 to
50 percent of married couples in the
United States divorce to be fair that
what is also in that percentage is
people that have been divorced more than
once right so it's not like yeah it's
not so it could be one person who's done
it four times right they all four of
those goes in but it is technically four
different like so like I was looking at
some gun ownership statistics in the
United States I think they have more
than one gun per person but I forget
what they call the mega owners yeah
super owners yeah they have like a
hundred yes and it's like some very
small percentage or something like that
so like mega divorces yeah my I don't
think I'm gonna have more than a hundred
but like yeah more than a hundred
divorces would be that would be in a
cult Guinness would get that would
legitimately be difficult to pull off
could you do it could you do it with
unwitting women oh god you convinced
the worst reality TV show yeah actually
the worst one such a plague on society
that would be really difficult to be
able to cobble watching so if you and I
went okay we go we go into it's gonna be
near to 200 we go to a new city every
year
okay and the idea is to get married and
divorced as many times as possible in
that year and they're gonna have to pull
but remember you you so there's nothing
would prevent you if you're a devious
enough bastard nothing would prevent you
from rolling multiple multiple marriages
at once yeah well I don't think you can
legally be married to two people at the
same time No so so you would have to
like timegate you would have to manage
it really carefully well cuz you you'd
had a minimum you have to do two a year
oh yeah oh yeah because the timespan
that you'd actually be effectively able
to do this yeah yeah at minimum at
minimum lion-like theoretically you're
gonna have to pull more than that yeah
I'd watch this show I would I'd feel
like a terrible Purcell anybody i watch
no exactly yeah yeah I'm saying it now
because it doesn't exist but like
playboy wars that's a suggestion from my
AV guy oh man Wow and you should have
okay you can have two different shows
going on at the same time because you
should have the marriage wars of the
guys trying to do it and you should have
the girls trying to do it yeah guys
versus girls
you know what we'd be at such a
disadvantage I think so I I have but who
knows like maybe not because it might be
harder to convince a guy to marry you oh
and then there's like the bisexual in a
gay aspect right right oh man
we're like you might be able to spend
more because of how that community works
and like whatever else
okay so just it's like not that it
matters but both Luke and I are straight
yeah um
answer me this if it meant that in a
spirit of winning the condition you know
maybe how can positive ask oh it
it depends on see if we could I know you
do almost anything almost anything yeah
especially if it's against you looks
like any well no but if you knew that I
was higher numbers and you were like
right beside me if we're at like 90 and
we're both at like 90 if I've gone this
whole competition and it just needs that
much more to win
like I'd consider it alright so I'm
already that much giant jerk I'm trying
to not swear so this yeah oh yeah you're
a terrible person terrible person
already um what's one more bead that is
against your thing yeah I don't know
yeah you're already horrible yeah so
like does it matter if you're destroying
women or men at that point that's what I
mean yeah and like it's another lie so
this is not a good show no you know I
don't know what the network is that does
all the reality shows but if there's any
execs watching don't do it please don't
do this you know the crazy thing about
it though is is it really any worse than
something like The Bachelor having
actors on it yeah
well cuz okay if there has ever at any
point been any one who participated in
that show that wasn't purely an actor
who actually like believed in it cuz you
know when they're gonna do the red stuff
okay so there was the one TV show and I
believe it was the UK someone could
correct me on this where they had a
Talent Search show that was fake have
you heard about that no and they
particularly picked people that were
terrible and kept pushing them through
and then I don't think they televised
any of it or something and then the very
last episode they televised and had a
live studio audience and they basically
told them on stage like you're horrible
and it was super awkward it was it was
it's I don't remember the name of the
show but you can watch the last episode
on YouTube and it has a giant dislike
bar because everyone's like wow this is
rough for like on stage in front of an
entire yeah that was called America an
American superstar okay so it was an
American show
oh wow that's yeah it was it was rough
in front of a whole audience and they
play like her singing like it's it comes
down to between a guy and a girl and the
girl wins and they play like a whole
montage of her singing and it's oh it's
not good and then they're like yeah so
we picked you because you are the worst
person in this category and then like
yeah we're still gonna give you the
studio deal but like come on also we're
gonna give you a bunch of money it's
really rough and like even watching that
it was like kind of soul destroying it's
really it's really rough Wow okay yeah
Wow okay uh let's go ahead and make you
some tech news cuz like I'm just feeling
kind of dirty right now WB superstar
yeah I think that's it let it sit WB
superstar yes this is it The WB's
superstar USA yeah oh man okay 40% of
users like to this show like it's it's
not oh all right the winner reveals here
we go let's see oh oh that's a shame
okay so here we go for some reason I
can't find which retailer it's listed on
the Tom's Hardware article doesn't say
but this was originally posted by TX
underscore to underscore step on the
forum Texas two-step ah or transmitter
two-step um the coffee lake platform is
finally being expanded up until now
you've been limited to what the 8700 K
the 8600 K and the 8400 all high
performance six core parts wait I 586 oh
here we go
so there are three new parts that are
coming and I 580 600 like an on K and oh
is there an 8700 already there might be
there's an i-5 8500 so an even lower end
is this gonna be a six core part and
then an i3 8300 apparently was already
an i3
350k you know what I haven't actually
paid that close attention to it
I haven't been able to think of a very
compelling reason to buy coffee lake if
you aren't going for an eighty six
hundred K or at least an 80 400 or up
because like I don't know if the 80 350
K already existed because unless you
were getting six cores on the mainstream
platform you might as well just go for
kb lake because the boards are cheaper
if you're not getting an unlocked chip
you do not need to get AZ 370 board what
can I do for you I just I just AJ AJ
just posted in the floatplane work chat
saying that's why I don't move you won't
get my soul if you if you buy a house
and go back one I hate you a little bit
- that still means I own your soul so
good okay so these are meant to be
paired with the upcoming budget oriented
H 370 and B 360 boards Pro Vantage is
apparently the retailer also lists it
down clocked T versions of all of these
processors for bulk purchase so neat in
other news this was originally posted
over on digi x auo to begin shipping 8k
TV panels in the first half of this year
you care no I thought you don't yeah you
said it in such an excited like okay TV
panel then I was like I don't think it's
like okay you know pickin a so here's
why you might care about an 8k panel and
did it okay
you sit here reason number one you sit
very close reason number two you really
like stereoscopic 3d shut up and you
want your stereoscopic 3d to be at 4k
because every other line would be
effectively actually it would be a
little little more because it would be
double the resolution of 4k know half
the resolute
of it would be double the pixel count
half the resolution sorry okay
reason number the third that's a pretty
creative number two I'm interested you
really like um high-performance display
scalar technology and you want high-risk
shot up high refresh rate 4k displays
okay so those scalars will have to be
developed and built for these 8k TVs and
eventually be able to wrinkle down
reason number the fourth trying really
hard here um you uh you you want pixel
densities to keep climbing for mobile
displays actually it's pretty different
technology for you I don't think I want
to complain about while I have a moment
here and we're talking about panels yeah
is I've been holding off I don't know if
you remember like a year and a half ago
when I was trying to buy a swift really
great hold on yeah hold that thought
people are talking about the Olympics
like an 8k so funny because most of the
feeds of the Olympics look like they're
not even 720 yeah yeah yeah
the CBC feeds are pretty good but yeah I
think they're probably about seven
twenty but they're pretty good the yeah
I wanted to buy Swift like a year and a
half ago issue the new monitor my
monitors right now we'll just black
screen for one two three seconds at a
time yeah yeah randomly okay cuz they're
dying yeah I've had them for quite a
while it's okay yeah you've had them
since like the NCIX tech tips days yeah
okay yeah they're doing it okay yeah
yeah it's it's a little early I think
but like it's early in the they lasted a
long time range so it's fine
but yeah I've needed a new monitor for a
while because they're black screening on
me like that
pretty and I'll be the worst thing is
like if I'm playing counter-strike and
the screen goes black and then I get
flash bang and you're dead well it's
yeah cuz so screen goes black and I'm
like crap I need to like hide and wait
for the one two three seconds that my
screen is black and then I come back in
and someone's flash back to me so I'm
like first of all pure black to extreme
white now I'm just like oh goodness
still can't see ya
just need to wait it's it's terrible so
anyways I've been waiting for that a
sous monitor that I saw it see
not this year but your previously the
144 Hertz 4k it has every buzzword you
could ever want it still not out I would
be shocked if it hasn't landed in the
next couple months
oh.just that's I'm not gonna say what I
know but I'll say that I would be
shocked okay reason number five okay
everyone is making me say it pornography
like three pixels to the width of every
pubic hair nobody is asking for this
nobody you know I think you're asking
for this you're not asking for that at a
certain point it's better to leave it up
to the imagination to it like just a
little bit okay and speaking of
imagination I can imagine that it's
gonna be tough for a Colton to assign
sponsors ever again
oh wow oh yeah I know we've worked with
these guys before so honey is a free
browser extension that automatically
finds the best coupons on the web so
that you always get the best prices on
stuff you buy so while you shop honey
will instantly find every working coupon
code that it can and automatically apply
the best discount to your cart at
checkout so it saves you time because
they test coupon codes for you they test
over a million coupon codes a month and
they've partnered with lots of online
retailers like eBay and Newegg to help
you find the best deals
they don't sell your personal
information in some cases when you use a
coupon with honey they earn a small
commission from the merchant but they
don't sell your data or give your
information to third parties either so
basically there's no reason not to add
honey to your browser if you shop online
it's free and takes just two clicks to
install and saves you money so go to
join honeycomb slash Linus or click the
link below what you can't do because
you're watching click that link below
you can't click it but whatever you get
it join honeycomb slash Linus and try it
out today
in other news oh this is great I am so
hungry right now
Savage tricked the box of jerky is so
heavy I can't lift it I thought it'd
just rip
again I'm gonna have to pace myself on
the maple buffalo bacon I had an entire
pack last week during the show and after
writing you were munch on it after oh I
was munching the heck out of that after
the show what do you want this week I'm
down just want the traditional sure I'm
gonna do the cracked pepper and sea salt
that actually sounds pretty good but
I'll go something else okay sounds good
just don't touch my maple buffalo bacon
and we're good no it's fine you know
what traditional oh there we go Oh in
the new package
Lulu new package for there's no perfect
so savage jerky mmm their goal was to
create a snack made with the best
ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives that wasn't bad for you
but that was full of flavor and spice
I'm like drooling right now like
actually really excited not drooling
salivating but it hasn't come out of my
mouth so it's not drool yet I guess
we've got 13 different flavors of jerky
some of our personal favorites are the
maple buffalo meat bacon the Moho the I
like the cracked pepper and sea salt I
don't think you're as big a fan of this
one but Luke loves the traditional I'm
not as into the traditional you get
depends kind of like what what mode am
in and then if you have a fire hall that
lives like in your mouth then and you're
into the like really spicy stuff they've
got all kinds of flavors for you
everything from Carolina Reapers to
ghost peppers to like truly spicy
friggin jerky and they don't just have
jerky they do a spice rub
they've got barbecue sauce hot sauce I
haven't tried their hot sauce I should
actually try it I I love hot sauce
they've never seen pesto sauce yeah
fishy give us give us that hook there
Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of
the hottest peppers in the world so go
check it out at Jeanne dot us
apparently Savage turkey calm yeah just
go to savage turkey calm andrew's offer
code LTT there we go
easy all right so what else what else we
want to talk about today
oh yeah it's kind of interesting
hopefully um can we do this one first no
fight yeah I just want to forget
ah this was originally posted by monkey
biz Oh nine eighty five on the forum the
original article here is from BBC com
are we gonna ignore the no let's just
use the name cuz I mean that's right
here yeah Kylie Jenner is apparently so
over snapchat and their shares tumble
single handedly with evidently a single
tweet
okay well 1.3 billion dollars was wiped
off of snap stock market value after she
tweeted that she is no longer using yeah
yeah go ahead you go first
I'm gonna add a couple one it jumps
right before the fall and it also looks
like a somewhat natural pattern fall and
there's bigger dips here that's not even
the main one but what's interesting
about it is just that it happens
instantly oh sure yeah also there's been
a lot of doubt sewn around snapchat for
a while now and you can see they're
trending down
they're super trending down like to be
clear guys this is only the last five
days and like all of this concatenated
into one date like that's sorry that's
almost a straight line to yeah and like
Marquez recently had I think you
released a whole video about like
leaving snapchat or not liking snapchat
or something yeah let's see can I talk
about problem number two actually okay
so problem number two is like why do
people care that much what this okay you
know what no I get it okay I cared about
Marquez is a prominent influencer isn't
using a social platform your snapchat
1.7 million views that's from two weeks
ago weeks ago no I know but I'm saying
there's been a lot of doubts own okay
whatever you might think or not think
about Keeping Up with the Kardashians or
whatever you can't argue that they've
been successful at exploiting social
media so if they are like not if they've
so over snapchat then that does actually
seem relevant from a shareholder
perspective problem number the last for
me is why did anyone ever give a crap
about snapchat I don't get it
this is now I've disliked it the entire
time this is now two platforms that I
have just not really gotten and I've had
a lot of people putting pressure on me
because I'm supposed to be in the social
media space these are two platforms now
vine and snapchat but I've just like not
really gotten that have ultimately ended
up disappearing and I haven't had to
participate in them yeah I bought into
Twitter Facebook and Instagram not like
I don't own chairs I mean like I was
like YouTube obviously as well but like
those are the ones that I kind of went
yeah okay
I'll invest the time to bother to
develop these things and like learn how
they work and stuff yeah um those two
didn't get it as far as I could tell
snapchats entire value was trendiness
and it means that as soon as you're not
trendy where's your value yeah and
somebody that someone in the twitch chat
said nudes and like even then that
doesn't really make any sense
you just send nudes by email like I
don't understand what's the special
value well yeah well part of the idea
was that it would disappear but since
forever
everyone's known that you can just
screenshot a record course and I do not
realize that yeah really
I think people didn't but that's
volatile and now if you screenshot a
record it tells the person so now it
like sends them a message saying that
you screenshot it so now it's just like
kind of awkward I think I don't know
you're preaching to the choir a little
bit I've never liked snapchat to any
degree the only reason why I have it
right now is my brother sends me random
things every once in a while because he
prefers snapchat okay and that's about
it huh how else am I gonna send my nudes
says elusive soul any other that you can
literally even send them through
Instagram direct message okay okay we've
got a perfect segue into your flow plain
stuff citizen something citizen I am
something something does flow plain work
in the UK yeah that thing you told me
today oh yeah pull up what's on there
and you go ahead and talk about that cuz
that's pretty cool we have a viewer
I didn't even know you read that message
I thought you did we have a viewer from
Antarctica and it works Wow
you had a payment problem which is
unsurprising but but it works which is
great favorite problem has been solved
yeah so we can see we can see a map of
wherever he just told me but yeah okay
you can see that too it's really cool
because the audience is shockingly
global it's a very distributed yeah
which is cool and scary cuz we have to
solve it what do we got here oh there's
some good stuff in here
who needs more CPU cores this is finally
going up Wow
so this is kind of an explainer of core
i7 versus cry 9 as you can tell it isn't
sponsored um liquid metal in a phone is
this the first I believe ok yeah yeah
yeah so the follow up the follow up to
liquid metal in a laptop it's actually
shocking I was gonna say this might even
be more interesting for a lot of people
yeah
the one year airflow experiment the
stunning conclusion is apparently
missing a proper thumbnail so I'll go
hit someone after the show but that's up
it's done it's ready wow that's a lot of
views yeah um wow there's a lot of
discussion too but um buying selling and
safely storing Bitcoin mining adventure
part 4 is up so we go through some of
the wallet options some of the exchange
options just kind of help the whole
twitch chat is flipping out that we
finally are releasing the air finally
happening it's on to a plane now yep you
can go watch it right now Compu loud
isn't a brand that most people will
probably have heard of but this product
is very cool it is a passively cooled
small form-factor gaming machine with a
GTX 10 60 or 70 I think it's a 10 60
maybe 10 70 I'll remember it's really
good though
um oh no that went up on that went up on
YouTube that mapping you think we're
probably YouTube's range now I think
we're probably yeah yeah there might be
maybe something left oh I don't know if
handy tak under 100 mostly gaming went
up on YouTube maybe you did it oh yeah
oh yeah
120 hertz pc gaming on a TV still hasn't
youtube so um the reason for that is
that when we're scheduling it's a lot
easier to push something by a week then
it is to push something by a day and so
for whatever reason we have a
simultaneous release that we have to do
on a day when something scheduled it
usually gets bumped like the same day
the following week and i think it's
happened about 1/2 way it'll come yeah
it'll come
alright what else we got today yeah Wow
apparently snap CEO was paid six hundred
and thirty seven million last year
thought to be the third highest annual
package ever received by a company CEO
so this is in spite of them being under
pressure for Instagram like taking all
their key features and users complaining
about the redesign brilliant as much as
we can as fast as possible I know right
personally pull it all out personally
yeah yeah um Samsung speaking of which
the SAS auction was a lot of fun yeah do
you want to talk about it are we gonna
leave it in the video
so there's actually gonna be two of you
okay I don't know if people even knew
that what's happening yeah you should
so NCIX had their bankruptcy auction on
Wednesday and Thursday of this week so I
had gone in intending to make one video
but honestly it would be like a service
yeah okay or that we would have to cut
too much or it would be too long and
it's two different days even and it is
what makes sense it is across two days I
had also intended for it to be like
really structured here's some stuff we
found here's some stuff we bought here's
how much we paid SIA and what it really
turned into was more like me and Eddie
digging around the warehouse and like
finding relics like I found a computer
that I built that's what yeah in the
warehouse yeah do you remember the one
with the flames YES on it yeah that
still has the original build that I did
in it
like eight years ago and it was just
like sitting in a pile in the warehouse
I really wanted to go just for that kind
of reason like I wanted to go back to
the original filming room and stuff
mm-hmm
but like I just I didn't have the time
it was it was pretty it was pretty fun
it was sentimental yeah you know there
was some funny stuff I'll get my
sentimentality out of the video there
there was some kind of sad stuff like I
come across like the box of sort of her
stuff to work with everyday like her
gloves and like you know personal
effects not personal effects company
effects but that like her box of like
stuff that she needed by her scanning
station for like someone who's really
nice and that worked there a long time
and worked hard and was as far as I
could tell a very nice good person and
just doesn't have a job anymore because
of mismanagement yeah so there was like
some sad stuff um there's some random
stuff at one point ed and I leave the
auction and we go play squash did you
his film that yeah I've never tried
squash before which of course is a
perfectly legitimate reason to be
playing squash definitely when you're
supposed to be at work yeah video
totally um so no one at flow plate is
allowed to absorb that mentality hooray
all right yeah you're moving forward so
anyway it ends up being two vlogs a vlog
for day one of like digging through
everything cuz that was when they had
the viewing time when you were allowed
to go in and like pick through all the
different auction Lots yeah and then
part two where we attend the actual
auction I tried you know what no I'm not
gonna talk about it oh yeah we should
partly talk about alt X that's pretty
cool that's oh yeah LTX is happening
right um yeah so where we actually go to
the auction we you know do auction
things we leave the auction we run into
Julia at all what's that cafe called
it starts with a Z I think he is yeah we
run into Juliet Xia's who talked about
like the stuff that people are buying
probably being broken you know
she's doing now yeah she said I makes
computer shop yeah yeah she's like back
on YouTube so yeah there you go
yeah so she was very she wasn't tacky
about it when when she well sometimes
people will go on camera and would be
like hi yeah you guys might remember me
from NCIX tech tips I'm with Mike's
computer shop now go see Mike's computer
shop no she was very good about it so
that's that's why Julia gets the
shoutout for being at Mike's computer
shop on the one show right now yeah yep
yeah good good good for him good for him
you know what did you wanna talk about
alright LTX so yes we know we know LTX
Expo is redundant yeah but like you guys
go find a 7 character dot-com domain I
challenge you
that's right that's what I thought
there's good there's gonna be a lot of
responses yeah we'll just find like I'll
be pretty dumb yeah so we got a bunch of
information here um I don't know if we
have any partners yet so that's probably
not probably empty yep well hey course
there's in cool also though this is last
year all my partners I told me really
needs to put that on another page but
yeah that's really terrible or just not
anywhere yeah just probably shouldn't be
there or like it should be smaller or
something yeah it's freaking huge um
yeah that probably doesn't make a ton of
sense but yeah we got you know partners
we got a map map and schedules nope oh
that's coming soon too there's a really
helpful website so it's good that it's
subject to change because if it wasn't
gonna change it was just coming soon
forever then that would be bad yeah okay
hold on a second so here's an event map
coming soon but you can download it nope
nope that just takes you back so it was
built on Squarespace but it was built by
monkeys so it goes to show you
Squarespace beautiful website but you
actually still do have to like it still
looks good yeah it looks good and it's
fast gallery oh so here's ago so a lot
of people thought that LTX was just like
small or lame or whatever
and it was a little small it was a
little lame but it was actually a lot of
fun uh-huh
we had an absolute blast last year so
here's a bunch of the stuff from from
last year a bunch of the stuff that
people could do this year not Schilling
legitimately one of my favorite
conventions in years this one is gonna
be a lot more emphasis on the like the
one piece of feedback we got from people
was that they could come in for two
hours they could kind of do everything
so the idea this year is it's a one-day
event and we want to make it so that
it's basically impossible to do
everything hmm cool so every booth needs
to have enough to see or do that you
can't do everything and one of the other
things that this was an external
feedback but one of the other things
that we thought that we needed to
improve was there there was a lot of
stuff to do at LTX to the point where it
would actually take you all day if you
were to try every carnival game and yeah
and and participate in everything but
there wasn't much of an incentive so I
think a lot of people ended up kind of
like crowding into a corner and like
chatting with each other or whatever
else sorry oh yeah we could figure that
out anyway um so a lot of people ended
up kind of not doing everything and then
we ended up giving away a ton of like
prizes randomly at the end in a raffle
so this time cool there's gonna be like
mondo prizes for like going on the
bungee run or for throwing cases as far
as you can or whatever else the case may
be and I think I'm gonna do like the
Explorers pass this is a new hand in the
Explorers past for a ticket for the
raffle and the Explorers passing us to
get stamped at all the different booths
once you complete the activity oh that's
interesting
yeah that's a good idea - I've been to a
lot of I was actually about to say one
of the things that we should probably do
is also enter people just for
participating in lots of stuff so yeah
that would be great that would be a lot
of fun I like the combination of like if
you get past a certain threshold like if
you beat like 90% of people at this
thing or whatever and at the beginning
the day maybe it's easier yeah Colton
was not in Colton's Intuit cool so it's
good yeah we're gonna have a lot of fun
so go to Lt axe Expo com to get very few
details but
you can get tickets though can't you I
think you can get tickets right now
because I heard the like big tickets
already sold out really yeah I think so
oh wow someone tweeted me saying that
they're like they wanted it and now
they're sad or something I don't know I
sold that gang okay so in a nutshell we
can't really tell you much about it but
unlike last year where we were pretty
tepid on the land show about sorry how
much fun it would be it's gonna be fun
this is really really fun this is a tag
line okay we can't tell you much about
it but it'll be fun trust us yeah you've
got a much bigger venue this time we're
gonna as someone who's gone to add a
minimum one text slash gaming convention
every single year for like 14 years or
something yeah yeah it feels a little
bit more like some of the older ones did
where there was more stuff to do if you
go to pax these days they're still
really cool but they're mostly like a
spectator sport kind of situation where
you're mostly just like looking at
things there isn't a lot of activity
there's a lot to look at it takes like
two hours to wait through a line to play
a game that kind of stuff what I really
liked about the last LTX and seems like
it's gonna be a thing at this one and
you even mentioned like there has to be
enough stuff for people to do you didn't
say see you said do it's it's fun
because there's so many activities like
I don't know if we're bringing it back
but last year there was like hardline
water tube bending and like all this
really cool I think we're gonna have a
deal is your CPU station see like that's
friggin cool so we're hoping to partner
with the local retailers so the idea is
that you could bring your CPU and we'd
have the tools on hand and someone to
help you or or if you don't have one
then we'll have a board and a test bench
handy so you can like buy a new one and
we'll have hopefully a retail partner so
you can just buy it on the spot test it
make sure it works because you'll void
your warranty instantly yeah and then
you could deal it it and take it home
and use it that's pretty sick actually
yeah so like we've got we've got ideas
damn that's pretty cool there's some
pretty good ideas we could this might
get expensive oh well we could have some
and people could buy it to use but we
could have like a free geek CPUs for
people just to like do it with probably
you know nummy
we've got some really good ideas with
three geek um so you've seen be like
boxes and boxes like the pallets of
stripped motherboard PCBs right yeah do
you know about this no okay so one of
the ideas that we pitched to or at least
are going to pitch to free geek at some
point is motherboard house of cards and
then over the course of the day whoever
builds the tallest ya card house out of
motherboard P stripped mother word PCBs
wins a motherboard I don't know like
we'll figure something out cool but yeah
just like cool so it would be kind of
like you know at like science world when
there's just like it's not a booty
that's just like a bunch of blocks to
put together or whatever oh so you guys
kind of walk up there's a little sign
explaining what to do and you just go
for it and there's just a boxes of
motherboard PCBs and you just you build
it you just call a free geek person over
and go like look how tall it is and they
they write it yeah well great yeah
that's cool I like it yeah so that's the
that's the kind of stuff that that we
want to do at it cool umm what else do
we have for topics today what I really
liked last year too was with a lot of
those kind of things you'd run into
random attendees that would become like
like temporary single-serving friends
for the show because they met doing
whatever activity yeah because they
ended up being paired up for whatever
reason or they ended up just being next
to each other and talking and whatever I
thought that was really cool that's a
good idea
Colton we should have some activities
where people are forced to participate
like as a team with other people there
so that we like make people mingle
because that's what you need at Tech
events you have to force people to talk
to each other and get each other geez
okay more topics yeah I don't know this
is all
apparently apollo' is gonna refresh the
air pods ray um that yeah okay so I got
it I go to Google home mini and my idea
was a lot of times when I'm working I'll
like think of something I need to
remember later and it's actually like
kind of annoying to do the couple steps
to get into my phone or whatever and my
phone isn't very great at responding to
ok Google yeah I didn't even though it's
on it's just not I don't know why so I
got a Google on me and now when I talk
to the Google home mini 50% of the time
my phone does it too so this is like the
issue that I have with them so there's a
few things that are just kind of broken
on Android and just sort of in general I
guess here's one that really bugs me
when I swipe away notification when I
clear all on my phone do you have do you
ever have it happen where your phone
will just be like buzzing for the next
10 seconds because it will like Italy
notify almost like an email
notifications yeah it'll be like 9 just
a 7 as it goes through them and it's
just well might also refined them so
once you're fully cleared out it'll be
like oh you have you have a few throw a
watch into the mix that's really
annoying um that's not great there was
another really stupid like just dumb
stuff why is it that Google in their
infinite wisdom added marques read to
their SMS app which is super freakin
handy by the way like when you drag it
when you when you just pull down the
notification yeah I can reply or mark as
read why isn't that not in Gmail why is
that not in hangouts why is that not in
literally anything else yeah because and
this is really frustrating on iOS on iOS
there's no way to mark a text messages
on read so if you're like me and you use
read and unread only way to track what
you haven't haven't dealt with yet yeah
why is this so hard I don't get it
another thing with the Google home Mini
is I made it play a song just good one
to see how the speakers were and then I
was like it's really loud by default and
like the speaker isn't very great so I
was like I kept on telling it like
I'm gonna stop doing proper commands but
essentially turn the volume down yeah
it it inaudibly went down okay turn the
volume down okay turn the volume down
okay turn the volume down I just kept
doing it it was like not noticeably
going down
so then I was like turn the volume down
a lot and then it went to a completely
inaudible level of volume and there's no
like there's no volume physical slider
or anything so I can't it's just voice
commands I can't do it through my phone
it's so I'm just like so it's blaringly
ridiculously loud or off is like my too
but but not off because it took me about
15 minutes to recognize like this weird
buzzing sound that I could barely hear
was like nicly music coming from the
little bikes maybe just need better
music loser maybe if your music was like
happy you wouldn't mind if I don't know
what it was playing at that point you
heard me because it just random through
google play music and with someone some
random song I had no idea what it was
people say do it by percentage set the
volume to whatever okay not 25% all
right
but then that even takes trial and error
because I don't know what percentage of
that they're helping us they're helping
us okay that's that's decent though
that's not that yeah it should be it
should go down a reasonable amount if
you tell it to turn the ball I think tis
jester nailed it here or loop could just
not be an idiot nice thank you guys oh
that's so appreciate that
yeah yep yeah Luke was Luke was wrong
Luke was wrong 2018 don't bring that
website back the statement is cool the
website is not cool yeah yeah um all
right so I guess that's pretty much it
yeah everything else yeah some pirates
did pirate stuff yep with Microsoft's
uwp protection you know Samsung unveiled
a big SSD but that is physically small
just lots of capacity hooray utorrent
there's a vulnerability that's bad
that's surprising lordy there's more
augmented reality stuff out of Google so
call me in two years yep
Tesla is doing a wall charger but now
for your office which is like okay
okay um apparently it'll be free but you
stuff to pay for electricity what okay
also Asus is launching premium GTX 1050
and 1050 TI graphics cards with a
hundred and forty four hour of burning
quality control and longer warranties
aimed at LAN cafes okay from my
experience when it comes to like cheap
products it's usually it usually makes
far more sense to just like buy a new
one when it bricks because by then the
new one will probably be better than the
old one but whatever so we'll see you
again next week same bat-time same
bat-channel
by LAN cafe is still thing in some
places very much so yeah I definitely
still a thing but like I don't see why
they would buy a more expensive card for
it new website live with Mediacom let's
do
did someone already think it
you're already there
that's Paulette right would that be
terrible misspelling Luke wasn't even oh
it's available it's available Luke was
an idiot calm fantastic
Luke will be wrong 2019 calm and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
