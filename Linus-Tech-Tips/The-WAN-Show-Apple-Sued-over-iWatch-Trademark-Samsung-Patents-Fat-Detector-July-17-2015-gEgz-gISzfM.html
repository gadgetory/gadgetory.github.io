beginnings of our failure so today I am
even later than I was supposed to be
because I had some some audio issues
there and I do apologize for that every
time I set up in a completely new and
different environment it's always a new
and different adventure so today I put
together my streaming pack at the XA xx
camera a tripod the razorblade laptop a
capture card a mouse a mouse pad razor
blade laptop which unfortunately doesn't
have wired Ethernet so I had to bring
along my handy dandy little USB to
Ethernet adapter and then I borrowed a
table and I borrowed a place to stream
from from the NCIX guys so my original
brilliant plan was actually to film
everything that I needed back at our
studio today and then come out to NCIX
to film later and do the LAN show from
here which would save me a trip to
Richmond later tonight when I come out
to play till 8:00 to play badminton
apparently my mic is too loud well I
can't turn it down much so okay
recording devices blip Adeeb Wapiti
levels
hopefully that's fine not much not much
I can do other than just guess at this
point because me having my monitoring on
seems to be what caused the problems
before so there you go guys
um apparently peaking still it's echo in
the room mic good you guys drive me
absolutely - you guys drive me
absolutely crazy with this stuff you're
killing me here so yeah all right we're
just gonna have to roll but you know
what maybe Jack can help me out hey yeah
Jack are you on the stream does it sound
okay I've got people saying it's too
loud people saying it's too quiet people
saying that they've had too much bourbon
to drink today and they can't hear
anything they're they're blind and they
can't hear so uh yeah alright so I'm
gonna go ahead and kick off with our
first topic of the day I do not have
Luke
on the stream today he is actually on
vacation today so he's gone to the
Pemberton Music Festival whatever that
thing is called fortunately the
wildfires haven't completely gotten out
of control up there so the music
festival is a go he and Nick and Buerkle
have all gone up for the weekend so that
means I am on my own today for the land
show but the good news is that I have a
bunch of great topics for you guys today
including the recent reveal that skylake
Zeon's are gonna be rumored to have up
to 28 CPU cores I mean I thought the
current 18 core has well beast Xeon that
I had was like wow that's so amazing
it's got 18 cores no no we're talking 28
course Apple is apparently being sued
over the iWatch trademark something that
makes a ton of sense because their watch
is called the eye watch at least I think
CollegeHumor told me that it was called
the eye watch more on that later also
boeing has apparently patented a laser
powered fusion fishin jet engine concept
fusion and fishin and lasers I mean does
it get any better than that
yes it does when I roll the intro
I fix it
all right so let's kick off our first
topic of the day actually this is okay
we're a parent li gonna start with like
the worst news of the day so Nintendo
released a statement you can actually
check that out hear that
yeah no different wow this is like I
just it's hard for me to imagine if if
my life were to be summarized in such a
succinctly ficient manner like like if
linus media group issued like a
notification of death and personnel
change of a representative director so
president of Nintendo Satoru Iwata has
passed away at the age of merely 55
which you know a couple thousand years
ago would have been impressive that he
managed to be so to be so old and still
alive but today feels like he's been
taken away from us much much too young I
just oh man there's something very
there's something very cold about this
this document here career record June
2010 as director May 2002 appointed as
president June 2003 appointed as CEO of
Nintendo of America Inc so that is if
you're if you're into gaming that is
some that is some pretty crummy news he
actually has been with Nintendo for a
very long time started out with Hal
worked on Kirby as well as earthbound
total cult classic a lot of people
cutting their RPG gaming teeth on
earthbound and other games of that era
later worked on programming for the
Pokemon games push development of the
Wii and DS however you may or may not
feel about this it seemed like a good
direction for Nintendo at the time they
had some of their most successful years
ever so push development of the Wii and
the DS to appeal to people who weren't
necessarily gamers yet so really
recognize that gaming was becoming more
than just something that people do in
their mom's basement and passed away
from bile duct cancer so very very
unfortunate news for this week
yeah so so there you go I guess that's
what we're that's what we're starting
with this week Star Wars Battlefront
more bad news for I mean obviously to a
much to a much lesser degree the
original article here is from PC gamer
and actually I'm totally thrown off by
not having my not having my co-host with
me today so I'm gonna go ahead and pop
that link into the twitch chat before I
bring it up in my browser here I
actually really like this this one host
having the article like quite large
beside me and actually scrollable and
mostly viewable kind of thing maybe I
should just kick Luke off the wind show
permanently no I'm just kidding I'm not
going to do that Star Wars Battlefront
won't support split screen play on the
PC now I don't personally understand why
most PC gamers would have ever expected
this it's not like the typical PC gaming
you know you know like you go on you
know are / PC master-race or or battle
stations or whatever you're not going to
find a whole lot of PC setups that are
like yeah here's my PC you hooked up to
like a big monitor with four controllers
for all my split-screen
you know racing gaming with my friends
it's just it's it's not something that
we've typically seen on the PC but the
flip side of that is I would love to see
more of those things that are taken for
granted on the consoles supported on the
PC because it's not like you can't hook
up an Xbox controller or four to a PC
and have a really great cooperative or
competitive gaming experience with your
friends on a single display and yeah so
supports co-op play on Xbox one and ps4
but not PC so no split-screen and no
local co-op it good black of co-op games
on the PC is another one that really
grinds my gears but I don't really need
to get too deep into that because I'm
sure that you guys have heard that in
the past from me a fair bit so we've
still got a lot of people saying
the jack you're sure the stream is not
too quiet right Oh jack is gone Jack are
you sure the stream is not too quiet he
put on headphones okay I'll tell you
what I will turn it up a little bit
there are we happy
hopefully we're happy I really hope
we're happy you guys are driving me
crazy twitch chat now I know I saw
someone's chat message in the twitch
chat like blah you know you don't
interact with your with your twitch chat
viewers at all you know why because you
guys are usually trolling the crap out
of me that's why I can't interact with
you you have lost your interaction
privileges that is what happened here
that is what happened my friends so
let's go ahead and move on to our next
topic here ah yes IBM and Nvidia
launched supercomputer centers of
excellence you guys supercomputer
centers of excellence let's go ahead and
pull this article up bippity Boppity
news items redirecting so basically what
this amounts to is here we go at both
Oak Ridge National Laboratory and I want
to say some other location it's in my
notes but not here so these are oh wow
there's actually oh I remember reading
this article I'm thinking oh yeah this
is all like interesting stuff blah blah
I hope it's in my it's in my notes it's
actually not in the notes I'm just going
to cheat and look at the article so Oak
Ridge and Lawrence Livermore in they're
going to be delivered in 2017 and
operational by 2018 and they're going to
be called the yep sure wish I had this
oh okay yeah there you go got the memo
so they're gonna be called summit and
Sierra so these are part of IBM's whole
contract with the US Department of
Energy and they're gonna be used for a
number of really cool things so some of
it is going to be kind of your typical
supercomputing stuff like you know
weather mapping
that kind of stuff you know just staying
ahead on the in the supercomputer rat
race of the you know the other the other
nations that are working on their own
proprietary supercomputer systems China
and then some of the stuff that they're
gonna be doing is really cool so one of
them is apparently gonna be set to the
task of mapping the inside of the earth
I mean can you even begin to imagine
what kind of useful information that we
could possibly gain about the inside of
the earth whether it's to do with the
compensate composition whether it's to
do with you know Wow like it's yeah it's
sort of more than my imagination can
handle so yeah mapping the inside of the
earth which actually leads me to another
really cool topic Samsung has apparently
filed a patent so the original article
here is from Android authority let's go
ahead and pop this up here alright let's
go ahead and post this in the twitch
chat samsung has apparently patented a
sensor to detect your body fat so we
know that whether it's Apple or whether
it's Samsung or whether it's any other
profitable smartphone maker which more
on that a little bit later there aren't
a whole lot of them whether it's Apple
or whether it's Samsung smartphone
makers are really into the whole idea of
making your phone or your SmartWatch or
whatever other devices you're carrying
around with you making them into whether
wow I want to be really careful what I
say here because what I was about to say
was making them into useful tools for
you know monitoring your health and
living a more active lifestyle when
really my personal philosophy on this
whole thing is that it doesn't do much
of anything other than make you make you
want to buy it more like I think it's
just a pure sales pitch if we can
convince someone that buying this phone
or buying this SmartWatch will make them
lose 20 pounds then it's that whole
buying something based on self-image
rather than buying something based on
like a rational decision anyway
it's no secret that they that they want
not only to make us feel like they're
useful for these things but to actually
make them functionally better for these
things so this is a huge step in that
direction because there's only so much
information that you can get from a
pedometer and as my time with the Apple
watch has definitely taught me it's not
that much this so I mean I'd be sitting
there I'd be sitting there working on my
review one feature that I didn't use
because I'm just not that into the whole
health features thing on on phones and
smartwatches so one feature that I
didn't touch the whole time I was
naturally using the product for my
review was one where you can set a
predetermined workout so you can say
like hey I want to you know burn X
number of calories by walking really
fast so hey can you count me down on
this and I'll you know go do that so I
was just dinking around with the menu
and I turned that on and then I kind of
forgot about it and then I realized you
know 10 minutes later that I had
actually tracked I think it was
something like 4% of my brisk walking
exercise and I had literally been
sitting there writing a review about the
Apple watch and how I don't actually
think those kinds of features are that
useful so Apple went ahead and proved my
point for me there but if they could
measure body fat that may actually give
us some usable data over the much longer
term you know I you the problem though
is that that doesn't really tell us a
big picture unless it's accompanied by
accurate data and that that's another
real challenge is even the Apple watch
which was hailed as you know going to be
game-changing with all of the health
related body related sensors on it even
the Apple watch has been found to not be
that accurate of a heart rate monitor
unless you like you're practically bolt
it to your wrist so so this body fat
thing without other accurate data
doesn't really give us a whole picture
but it's definitely a move in the right
direction because over a span of you
know six months or whatever else if you
see significant changes if you're taking
measurements day
you know even if they're not that and
I'm gonna say the wrong one because
accurate and precise are not the same
thing for those of you who didn't know
that one of them means close to the real
value the other one means consistently a
value but maybe not necessarily that
close so so even if the reading is not
that precise I think that's the one
where if you're not precise you could be
scattered but probably around you could
still be accurate so if they're accurate
but not precise taking many readings
over a long period of time could give
you some really useful data about what
it is you're doing and whether or not is
helping and you know with the way that
with the way that Fitness vlogging and
lifestyle vlogging is taking off I mean
even in the the tech community of all
places you look at guys like like Jay or
Jerry that are doing frequent updates on
their personal fitness goals I mean that
kind of stuff is great and giving people
new tools is great but it still doesn't
change it still doesn't change my
perception of these features as tacking
things on to a product that seemed to be
designed to sell them to us rather than
designed for people to genuinely use
them so that patent was just granted so
there's no word as of yet on when we
will see this technology in phones but
the idea is that you would just hold
your smartphone and it would measure
your body fat percentage using
electrical impedance readings so very
cool stuff I guess that leads us pretty
well into this this next topic here this
is absolutely mind-blowing and I will
show it to you guys in a second so the
latest estimates here there we go
Oh Luke is Luke always does it the not
lazy way and makes it so it doesn't
leave that ugly Google link in the
twitch chat that sorry I'm running the
show by myself today here guys I
apologize report Apple takes 92% of
smartphone market profits on just 20% of
sales so to put that number in
perspective this is this is a Wall
Street Journal quote roughly a thousand
companies make smartphones one of those
companies reaps nearly all the profits
is that not absolutely mind-boggling and
you can point to a lot of different
causes for this you can point to the
fact that Apple's hardware is frankly
not that high speck compared to a
flagship Android phone that's gonna have
eight CPU cores in it a high end GPU
although Apple does put powerful GPUs in
their in their smartphones it's gonna
have you know 1440p display apple
doesn't Apple doesn't have any smart
phones that feature 1440 displays they
just finally went 1080p with the iPhone
6 plus
you know Android makers have been
putting NFC in their phones for years
whereas Apple only just finally rolled
that out Android phone makers I mean
these are things that everyone has to
pay the same amount for in fact thanks
to apples well their buying power thanks
to apples buying power they'd probably
don't even pay the same for things like
like memory or a flash storage Apple
doesn't put as much RAM in their smart
phones because they can control the
operating system to the point where they
simply do not need it so there's a lot
of reasons I mean Apple charges a high
price for every phone they sell you can
look at Samsung and go oh well you know
they have a 600 or $700 phone or
whatever line is that's an s6 acting
that's a $600 phone s6 edge is an
expensive phone yeah but the thing is
that companies like Samsung are also
spending R&amp;amp;D money on developing low-end
phones where the sale price is actually
much closer to the bond cost of the unit
then you would probably think because
you know that's that's one of the things
you know those articles that come out
every time a new iPhone or a new Galaxy
S whatever is released where someone
doesn't tear down and is like okay well
the bond cost for this panel and that
motion sensor and that button is is
whatever it happens to be and you kind
of go wow really that thing only cost
like 130 dollars to make and it's $600
retail so think about this for a second
the R&amp;amp;D that goes into producing a phone
is gonna be a lot regardless of whether
it's a $600 phone or a $200
phone and if your cost on a high-end
phone can only be as high as like 150
170 bucks then your cost on a $200 phone
in order to make you know $400 of gross
margin on it well gee that that math
doesn't work at all and something a lot
of people don't realize is that a
flagship you know Snapdragon 810
actually doesn't cost that much more
than an 808 there isn't a huge discount
because much like what you'll see on you
see this on desktop processors - you can
buy an extreme edition for $1000 or you
can buy you know 5820k for 350 bucks or
whatever that is those two chips cost
the same so when you are responsible for
actually manufacturing the chips you get
actually like you can sell it for a lot
but then your your cost to manufacture
it and therefore your discount that you
can give on lower end products isn't
necessarily that different so so if
you're making low-end smartphones you
are basically buying market share you
got to have some other kind of agenda
whether you want people signed up for
you know your your partner apps that
you're including on the phone or whether
you want people locked into like what
Samsung was doing for the longest time
where they'd include all their own you
know Mail app and App Store like if you
want to if you want to make future app
sales and take a cut of that or whatever
else the case may be because you are not
making money on that handset once you
factor in Rd and the margins that the
carriers want to make or the retailer's
want to make or whatever else so um just
to give you guys some idea of what the
rest of the landscape looks like Samsung
took a further 15 percent of the profits
which is kind of kind of a funny way of
doing the math because if Apple took 92%
and Samsung took 15% hold on a second
that's 107 percent of the profit in the
smartphone industry Linus what're you
doing um well that's because pretty much
everyone else out there is making a loss
on their smartphones to make up for that
money that Samsung and
are gonna make it's amazing what a
reversal there's been in the last few
years I mean it was a mere three years
ago that hold on a second that we were
looking at 5050 between Samsung and
Apple for these numbers whereas Apple
has just absolutely you know it's it's
really funny go figure
Apple got even more dominant than before
by delivering what people obviously
wanted I mean how many people bought a
Galaxy Note simply because they had this
is a great strawpoll okay I want the
iPhone users to answer this for me
though let me just apparently there's a
new version of strawpoll launching at
some point here so how many bought a
note or similar large okay okay how many
converted okay from iPhone to Android
simply because Apple offered no sorry
I'm talking really slow no large screen
offer yeah it's hard to talk while you
type and not talk at the same speed that
you type while slowing down your typing
because you're trying to talk at the
same time all right so let's go with yes
no and turnip as usual I actually really
like having the stream computer right in
front of me here it is super duper
awesome and nice so there we go guys
vote in that straw poll let's have a
look at the results here as they come in
many of you voting for turnip which by
the way is our latest shirt and is
available right now at teespring comm
slash vote number four turnip let's go
ahead and drop that in there and go back
to our straw poll here really
interesting so there you go
go figure apples even more dominant
today with their super premium pricing
high-end devices simply by giving the
people what they
have been asking for for like what was
it three years between the release of
the first note and the iPhone six-plus
personally not a huge fan of the iPhone
six-plus I have small hands but hey a
lot of people want it it is better for
the media enjoyment experience it's
something that I have noticed going from
the LG g4 to the s6 active which is the
phone review that I'm working on at the
moment here it's about 60% of you voting
for turnip really do appreciate the
turnip voters showing up in full force
here I guess I shouldn't be surprised
that the twitch chat is always trolling
me when I encourage them to you know
turn up all over everything it is that
we're doing which isn't to say that I
want to hear about fire pools any more
ever again at all yeah I mean really
guys really there is nothing that I can
do I cannot put a fire pole in the
office for obvious liability reasons you
guys oh okay so we've got more news
articles here let's go ahead and I'm
gonna grab the Linus tech tips forum
link here I'm gonna wait for the
redirect this time post that in the
Twitter where'd my twitch Django where's
my twitch it and the twitch chat has
exploded asking for fire poles of course
that was going to happen
researchers build a transistor from a
molecule and a few atoms it's funny
because this lands on the same week when
we've got news out of intel that they
are going to be for the first time and i
think what is it i want to say like six
years or something like that
intel has changed their forecasts saying
that they are not going to be able to
stick to their tik-tok strategy which is
a dye shrink every every other cycle and
then a refinement of their
microarchitecture every other cycle may
have been like on schedule
they called it tick-tock because it was
going to be reliable like a clock
moore's law was not going to let us down
well for the first time ever intel has
stumbled and then boom we've got news
dropping that reese
our building transistors from a molecule
and a few atoms so it works similarly to
quantum dots but the transistor depends
on just the charge state of one organic
molecule so just a single electron
affects the molecule state with
individual atoms of indium surrounding
the molecule and regulating the electron
flow this could lead to integrating
these sorts of transistors into
traditional CPU so this isn't like some
crazy like oh it's only gonna be useful
for like you know quantum computers that
are liquid helium cooled or whatever the
case may be you know this could turn
into something that you could actually
use in your computer extremely exciting
stuff which leads us into those those
other I mean these are fairly rapid-fire
news topics but I'm still going to go
ahead and post these badboys here so
tsmc is going to be starting testing on
their 10 nanometer process starting next
year which is another another huge huge
bit of news so competition between
samsung and tsmc in 10 nanometer FinFET
market heats up will hold on a second
where does Intel figure into all this
Intel well that's our next news topic so
for now let's just talk about TSMC and
Samsung so TSM C is apparently ramping
things up and really putting their foot
on the pedal in order to have a crack at
Apple's a10 processor production so I
guess that also would align with the
rumors that Apple's a10 processor will
be produced in 10 9 out of 10 nanometer
process nodes so that could reeled
apparently and this is sort of this is
all for caste stuff so it's not really
that meaningful today but we're looking
at a potential 20% performance gain with
a 40% reduction in power consumption who
here oh this is a good one
strawpoll time my friends if Apple gets
a 40% power consumption reduction on the
a-10 will Apple use it to extend battery
life yes or no remember guys
the other option is that Apple will
simply turn it into thinner iPhones and
iPads yet again completely ignoring the
fact that some people like me
legitimately want just more freakin
battery life Wow we've got these votes
coming in here guys with 72% even turnip
is losing this vote today a massive 70%
of you are saying no Apple will not use
the power savings to extend battery life
and there are legitimately good things
they could do with it for example I've
been saying well since my MacBook review
that I think the direction that Apple's
heading is a MacBook like an ultra
portable laptop that is powered by their
tablet processors and smartphone
processors so that's something they
could do they could use that extra 20%
you know performance and then 40 percent
power to like actually make a bigger
chip that consumes you know a similar
amount of power but it's like actually
like way higher performance and they
could go and put it in a laptop or on
the phone and on the tablet side they
could just make them thinner and I like
how many Bend gates do we need how many
Bend gates do we need that's all I have
to say it looks like the vast majority
of you are reinforcing my disappointing
hunch that Apple is going to ignore
people like me who I'm even I even ran
out on the s6 active one day which kind
of surprised me because that's a
thirty-five hundred million power
battery compared to I think it's I want
to say 38 50 or something like that on
the Droid turbo so um yeah I actually
ran out one day usually I make it
through like I'm I'm sitting at 28%
today though but I have used it fairly
heavily with GPS and all that kind of
noise Wow I feel like I've been talking
a mile a minute on this stream but
apparently you guys like that we have
6400 viewers what is going on we are
halfway through this show that is
absolutely incredible now I don't want
to screw it up and talk about like some
kind of boring topic like let's play
what's on the desk here at the NCIX
studio
here we go oh look at that we've got an
Intel 750 series 1.2 terabyte SSD just
sitting here we've got another Intel 750
series 1.2 terabyte SSD this time in a 2
and 1/2 inch form factor no no Jack
that's cheating I'm not taking your
McDonald's Happy Meal nonsense on only
things that are within my reach we've
got a 4 Way SLI bridge ah random cheapo
IO shield yeah oh is this under NDA what
is this no - OH - are you sure Oh Oh is
there computing there nope just a power
supply I'm just weak oh well that's
disappointing so I guess we've got one
of these it's funny because I had a call
with someone today where I was told not
to publish my review yet so whose fault
is it then if we break an NDA on my show
with your review sample yeah I think
it's probably my show that's that's
gonna get the take the fall for this one
oh I can't tell I thought it was a
Samsung curved 24-inch monitor but it
turned out it was actually a Samsung
flat 24-inch monitor got 24 inches it
the whole curve thing doesn't make a
whole ton of sense to me personally all
right we don't have to play this game
anymore that was fun though Oh
actually these are these are super handy
we are finally getting some of these in
our studio we're getting a bunch of a
bunch of clear ones for storage of
things oh here's the curved one look a
curved monitor it's curved which is good
at least that's what I tell her
yep curved for her pleasure mine so I'm
pretty sure that depends on the
direction of the curve and like the
position at the time cuz like you know
like a 180 degree turn
you know from certain angles might
actually be quite uncomfortable oh look
I haven't managed to scare off that many
of you I was gonna see if I just go off
on a completely stupid tangent how many
of you are gonna are gonna hate me
forever and and to note wow I'm
seriously thank you guys for tuning in
anyway let's move on to our next topic
today Intel reportedly delays their 10
nanometer mass production due to poor
yields so let's go ahead and post the
post the link to the forum here alright
let's go ahead and pull the article up
on ARS technica here alright Intel
confirms tik-tok shattering kb lake
processor as Moore's law falters so the
company will make three generations of
14 nanometer processors delaying the
switch to 10 nanometer and you know what
it might not necessarily be the end of
the world I mean you look at what NVIDIA
has managed to do stuck on 28 nanometer
for a freaking dog's age I mean think
about that first I can look at the
improvements we saw in efficiency as
well as performance going from Kepler to
Maxwell in spite of the fact that they
were stuck on the same manufacturing
process node
maybe the engineers of Intel can pull
you know magic duck out of their hats
and turn this into a positive an
opportunity to optimize their 14
nanometer processors in a way that maybe
they didn't think about before because
they were just relying on on process
node shrinks or or maybe none of that
will happen I mean what I would love to
see happen you know we've seen a lot of
bad news out of Intel in the last few
weeks here whether it's the job cuts or
whether it's the you know the stagnant
desktop processor sales leading to you
know an earnings shortfall prediction
like that
that kind of stuff maybe what this will
do is its be a bit of a you know wake up
and smell the coffee call for them to
really innovate in terms of performance
because we've seen them innovate in a
lot of ways like let's face it as much
as enthusiasts might not get you know
excited about 10 watts of better you
know power savings or whatever the thing
that we enthusiasts need to realize is
that if Intel can build that that means
that they could probably build a more
complex higher performance chip that
consumed a similar amount of power even
if it's not you know double the
performance hey I would take a you know
30%
you know generation over generation
performance improvement like we used to
see sometimes in an absolute freaking
heartbeat so I would love to see Intel
find a way to capture the the hearts of
the enthusiasts and not just not just
the minds by you know maybe dialing back
all the graphics onboard of an
enthusiast grade CPU maybe dialing up
the single threaded performance would
love to see them just kind of take a
look take a long hard look at where
they're heading and and figure out if
it's exactly the right direction and you
know I I hate to do this but AMD did
their earnings call q2 2015 hold on I
don't actually have this in the dock
here but edited transcript blah blah
blah blah blah
dang it did anyone do an article yea
revenue Falls again this and this and
this blah blah blah
let's see blah blah blahs and whatever
etc okay so crap I can't find it I
actually talked about it on net link
daily today but AMD has can you can you
can you remind me what was it they're
going ten nanometer in 2017 or something
like that no they've taped out they
taped out what okay AMD's first FinFET
processor has taped out which means we
actually could be closer than we thought
so that was one of the things they
covered on their earnings
all this is a huge opportunity with
because you gotta understand guys if
Intel decides to build like a
consumer-grade you know like a like you
know like something 770 K processor with
more of an emphasis on CPU and less
emphasis on GPU and power savings in
blabbity blah that takes years it takes
years to turn that around so if AMD is
already you know waist-deep in the
development process of Zen and then
turns out to be a success
man we could see another you know golden
year or golden two years out of AMD on
the CPU side and we could see like some
legitimate reasons for an enthusiast to
buy an AMD CPU I really hope for this
for two reasons number one you know I
put an AMD CPU a lot of people call me a
fanboy they'll call me an Intel fanboy
or an Nvidia fanboy and something I'd
like you guys to understand is that AMD
will always hold an ATI for that matter
AMD will always hold a very special
place in my heart even though they
absorbed ATI although funny thing is AMD
is worth I think it was something like a
quarter of what they paid for Haiti I
think today anyway they'll always hold a
special a special place in my heart
because the very first computer I built
for myself AMD processor guys Barton
2500 plus my friends overclocked the
snot out of that thing made it 32
hundred plus equivalent which I told
myself at the time because let's face it
when I was young I was a bit of a fanboy
I told myself at the time that that was
somehow equivalent to a 3.2 gigahertz
you know p4 C which come on come on AMD
fans let's let's be honest with
ourselves for a second here the
performance rating system was dead was
dead long before the the p4 c launched
Pentium 4 B was not that equivalent to
aim DS PR or you know press release or
public relations or performance rating
whatever they wanted to call that system
and actually the first ad in graphics
card I ever bought ATI and my friends
9600 all in wonder Pro BAM
so you know I'd love to see a return to
the glory days there even if you know
I've been disappointed time and time and
time and time and time again with the
latest being the fury accent you know
AMD does it to themselves guys they they
build up this hype train they build up
this hype train and then and then they
under-deliver and you know the fact of
the matter is I can't help myself as an
enthusiast I just want to see fast
Hardware like I'm not that focused on
who what brand makes it these days I
couldn't care less I just want to make
it go fast you know what I mean
and I still I still have some hope for
the this this 19 centimeter theory-based
card that's apparently gonna be
launching sometime in mid-august I don't
know if I actually have an article here
in the doc for that one but that was
just something that I was that I was
reading about so I think I just I think
I just completely broke the document and
all that is so nice ghosts who deserves
a shout out because he does so much
behind the scenes for the way and show
member of the Linus tech tips community
ghosts he actually fixed me over writing
a bunch of crap in the doc while I was
looking at it he helps flesh out the
topics he coordinates the folks who put
together the time stamps and sends that
to me so I can go ahead and get that
posted for you guys and look at this has
added the kick guru article that I'll go
ahead I'll post this in the twitch chat
here boom and I'll go ahead and pull
this up here about AMD's FinFET whoops
keep clicking the wrong thing because
I've I've set up my scenes differently
Andy we have taped out our first FinFET
product first couple of FinFET designs
blip Adeeb Wapiti etcetera etc need for
production etc so tape out is the final
stage of the design design cycle of an
integrated circuit the point at which
the artwork of the IC is sent to the
maker of photomasks okay so once the set
of photo lithic masks is made and
verified it is sent to a contract
manufacturer for the chip which produces
the first working samples of the chip so
they should get their first samples
sometime in September very exciting
stuff and hopefully they're headed in
the right direction
here all right what else we got here oh
speaking of ballin processors as much as
Intel hasn't delivered much for you know
gamers to wet their panties over in the
last few generations here this is gonna
get some server and you know high
performance computing folks pretty
freaking excited here so original
article here is from kid guru Intel's
28 core Xeon codenamed skylake CPUs to
support six terabytes of RAM on an LGA
3467 form factor with a rumored six
channel built-in memory controller and
support for up to eight CPUs on a single
motherboard yes the Perley platform will
be Intel's biggest server platform
advancement in many years when it's
rolled out okay no time soon
unfortunately it's not gonna be rolling
out until 2017 and that assumes
everything stays on schedule which as
you guys know it's not always the case
but it's gonna use a new bus called UPI
operating at 10 Giga transfers per
second and Zeon's themselves will have
built in 10 Gigabit Ethernet and or 100
gigabit per second omni path integrated
on to the dies now that is some useful
technology to start building on die
because I mean I don't know if I don't
know if some of the younger folks are
gonna know this but on Intel chipsets
for years and years and years like
remember when we in the early days of
gigabit remember when it was like really
rare like practically unheard of to have
an Intel gigabit network chipset on
built into your motherboard a lot of
people don't know this it was all on
there was on there all that time Intel
chipsets had Gigabit LAN on them it was
actually a licensing fee that the
motherboard maker had to pay to Intel in
order to activate it so wrap your brain
around this for a second it was cheaper
for the motherboard maker to
ayuh chipset from Realtek or Marvell or
whoever the case may be and put that
physical chip on the motherboard
increasing the complexity of the PCB not
to mention buying another chip than it
was to just unlock the Gigabit Ethernet
that was onboard so so yeah so more
Intel you Fernet I don't know if Intel
has adjusted their pricing structures or
whatever's happened but we've seen a lot
more Intel you for net lately and moving
that on dye is only good Wow excuse me
that snuck up on me that was rude it's
only gonna be a good thing especially as
network speeds ramp up and latency
becomes much more important to go along
with the massive bandwidth that we're
gonna need in order to achieve you know
100 gigabit per second connections and
all that kind of nonsense this is
definitely the day's most hilarious
piece of news Apple is getting sued over
the name I watch even though that's not
what their product is called so let's go
ahead and test this i watch look at that
the first search result is Apple the
next search result is European lawsuit
over I watch name shows what Apple had
to choose Apple watch that's that's
that's a really funny thing because I
definitely did wonder why they went with
Apple watch instead of I watch ok
there's 9 to 5 Mac / i watch the
european trademark holders file the
lawsuit apples getting sued it's so
funny the power of Apple even if they
don't call it something it still
completely dominates the headlines
so anyway what they're butthurt about so
it's an Irish company that owns the
iWatch trademark in Europe is upset that
Apple paid to put Apple watch ads on
Google for the search term i watch which
i can totally understand why they did I
mean let's face it you're an average
consumer who's not you know hanging on
to you know
Joanie Ives every word you're gonna
probably think it's called the eye watch
because that's what like Apple stuff
that goes in your pocket or you know on
your wrist if you had one of those
tricked out iPod nanos that's what Apple
portable devices are called so for
people to go and search on Google for I
watch and expect to get an Apple watch
is a perfectly reasonable thing so for
Apple to take advantage of that and
convert those people to sales makes a
ton of sense so yeah but I can also
understand you know why this particular
trademark you know upset is is is is
going on here so apparently the Europe
iWatch trademark is valued at 87 million
euros and Google is evaluating the
trademark complaint which apparently
they do on a case by case basis so it
wouldn't be the first time this has ever
happened thanks ghost in 2012 Apple
actually paid 60 million to settle a
trademark dispute in China over rights
to use the name iPad hmm I should start
trading my trademarking Apple things
I've been predicting for a long time I
home I should trademark
I home I think Apple's gonna do like
like completely prepackaged homes that
are just fully automated and integrated
with all of Apple's services and
everything the AI home it's called an AI
home oh that's lame well i house then
BAM I don't miss I'll I residence I
structure all right no we should do
sponsor spots right sponsors today
Dollar Shave Club if you don't know what
Dollar Shave Club is you can visit
dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus because
I can't be arsed to tell you about it
no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I
hope no one from Dollar Shave Club is
watching this Dollar Shave Club is the
service that gets you high-quality
razors delivered directly to your door
for only a few bucks a month you can get

well as a wet wipe and a peppermint
scented butthole is the kind of butthole
I want to have so that's
dollarshaveclub.com / linus - join the
club and start saving time and saving
money also sponsored today do you guys
have an eye fix-it toolkit you guys
bought one on mass drop oh really do you
do you have it here oh but it's over at
the other ok well it's okay I'm just
doing a sponsorship spot for I fix it so
I figured if I could hold one up that
would be great I don't have mine in my
backpack today but guys the iFixit pro
tech tool kit is winner winner chicken
dinner it is absolutely fantastic it's
got all kinds of little useful things
that you can use the guides on
ifixit.com in order to follow along and
and repair your electronics and all that
kind of good stuff
so let's go ahead and find out what all
of my talking points are supposed to be
for I fix it because I don't really know
what to say
other than that they've got not only
their fantastic guides but also
fantastic tools I've used iFixit tools
for dear Lord pretty much any piece of
electronics that I had disassembled or
repaired ever since I first ordered a
pro Tech tool kit Wow
it was about two and a half years ago
that I got my first Pro Tech tool kit so
I'm talking the iMac I'm talking the
MacBook I'm talking cell phone repair
whatever the case may be they've got
torques they've got try wing I took
apart a DES with it and if you use offer
code when show you can save $10 on a
purchase of $50 or more and get your own
Pro Tech tool kit today and it doesn't
just end at the Pro Tech tool kit
they've got all kinds of great stuff
there like when I put the when I took
the iMac apart I didn't realize until I
read their disassembly and reassembly
guide that you actually have to have get
replacement adhesive strips and all
kinds of crap like that so they stock
all that stuff as well they stock like
the little wheel for cutting it actually
comes in a kit you get a
wiill for cutting the adhesive strips
and then you get new adhesive strips to
put it back together and it looks just
like factory new so we love iFixit tools
around here at Linus tech tips and we
definitely recommend picking one up if
you haven't already
speaking of picking things up if you
haven't already let's go ahead and drop
this link in the twitch chat boom Boeing
patins laser powered fusion fishin jet
engines yes that is as complicated as it
sounds so naturally the original source
here for the article is ARS technica
these guys do such a great job of the
highly technical topics because I'm a
confessed to you guys I am NOT some kind
of you know physicist here and I am NOT
going to be able to explain to you
exactly how the crap this works but
essentially there you go that is a
diagram of the patent now to be clear we
are nowhere near fishin being useful for
like you know pushing planes around yet
but they're patenting the concept once
the technology advances to the point
where they could build something like
this they're just sort of saying
theoretically like they could so
basically the way that it works is they
are going to shoot lasers at deuterium
and tritium so does heavy hydrogen
inside the engine causing the atoms to
fuse okay so then gas from the fusion
reaction would then be pushed out the
back of the engine creating thrust
leftover neutrons from the fusion
bombard the inside of the engine which
is coated with fissionable uranium
generating heat which powers the lasers
helping it sustain itself as it goes so
fusion remember guys is combining atoms
fission is breaking them apart so
fission is the one that we've harnessed
at this point with Fusion being the one
that we still have a long way to go out
I might have actually screwed that up a
moment to go but the point is lasers and
nuclear reactions tearing apart and
combining atoms Wow
those should be some pretty badass
badass jet engines all right what else
do we got here today t-mobile has a new
family plan this is a pretty quick topic
not a whole lot to really say about it
other than that t-mobile continues to
put the thumbscrews on the other mobile
carriers their web side looking at the
wrong dang it wait this should be yep
Wow let's go with Android authority
today so their plan is 10 gigabytes per
line which is pretty fantastic when you
compare it to what the others are
offering and it's a hundred and twenty
bucks for four lines and it's pretty
much unlimited everything so it includes
ten gigs of 4G LTE data now you can say
whatever you want about t-mobile's
coverage and my first-hand experience
with t-mobile's network compared to AT&amp;amp;T
has not been very favorable with that
said every time we go down to the u.s.
we all refill our t-mobile pay-as-you-go
Sims because for three bucks a day or
whatever for LTE I think up to a hundred
Meg's of LTE data per day as far as
pay-as-you-go plans go
it is pretty freakin fantastic
especially compared to what we can get
in Canada so let me just have a look at
what else is include here ten gigs per
line
no sharing and you can get 20 gigs for
an extra ten dollars per month pretty
awesome all right what do we got next
here
ah yes Microsoft CEO clarifies their
mobile and Windows 10 strategy so oops
original article here guys I'm gonna pop
that in a twitch chat boom here we go
and news items hmm all right so talks
about is thinking around product
differentiation and being ahead of the
curve in this CUDA you know this is the
first time Wow
this is the first time since Windows CE
II just to kind of put it in perspective
that I've had some kind of hope
that Microsoft knows what they're doing
and could legitimately be a major player
in the in in the in the Windows Mobile
so like windows phones and in Windows
mobile based tablets or whatever else
what other other products we see roll
out especially phones this is the first
time that we've seen so many dramatic
changes for the better at Microsoft like
looking at how much feedback they're
taking on Windows 10 you know seeing
people posting stories about how they
submitted a bug report or a feature
request and it showed up in the next
build I mean that kind of crap is
amazing that kind of a transparent
process is amazing and so this is the
first time in a long time that I've
looked at Windows Phone and gone maybe
there's hope for this because there's a
lot about Windows Phone that's good I
know that I've crapped on it a lot in
the past and I have good reason to crap
on it because let's face it if you want
to win me as a customer its ecosystem
why is Apple so successful at charging
so much for their phones ecosystem how
do they get away like you look at the
way they backpedaled on the iPhone 5c
they even dabbled in okay let's try
having like a cheap option and they got
the crap out of there because they
realized they were doing themselves no
favors with a plastic cheaper phone no
favors at all because their customers
want them anyway they wanted to be part
of that premium ecosystem and so you
have to sell me an ecosystem and if I
buy a new phone today I expect to have
us a Sonos app or I expect my you know
Spotify or Google play music or whatever
account to be able to beam to my
wireless speakers in my house like I
expect all my crap to work I don't want
to be fighting with third-party apps
that get broken with every other update
of the OS or or new hardware from the
hardware manufacturer or whatever the
case may be but there are a lot of good
things about Windows Phone it's really
responsive runs great on low-end
hardware I mean seeing the way that
Android can bog down even something as
high-end as an s6 active or something as
high-end as a Droid turbo
it's so disheartening I mean we're
talking devices in three we've got ones
coming with four gigs of RAM on them and
it still can't handle this stuff okay so
I I would be really excited to see
Microsoft not leave the mobile market
and that has been clarified they are not
leaving the mobile market
yeah the surface is a product to show
what the platform can do and the reason
people should make universal apps is
that they will be on Windows desktop a
hololens is apparently also made to be
used in business not just gaming so
these are a couple of sort of pressing
concerns no they're not leaving mobile
which is pretty freaking Smurfs it's a
little disappointing that Windows RT
isn't going to be getting an update to
Windows 10 you know I'm sure that as
disappointed as yeah if people who
bought surface Artie's weren't already
you know buried in disappoint that's
just kind of the the final nail in the
coffin but yeah bummer I guess there's
nothing we can really do about it now so
let's go ahead and pop up our next topic
here bippity Boppity woman changes her
name to get control of facebook account
so the original article here is from
independent co uk oh wow sorry I had my
I had my sidebar running that whole time
there sorry guys so a London woman has
to change name by deed poll to login to
Facebook I can't believe I'm stuck with
this stupid name and still can't get
into my facebook freaking hilarious a
little bit of background here so set up
account with a fake name back in 2008 I
mean I've struggled with this kind of
stuff in the past before to like the way
that you know Google locks down your
YouTube username or your Google+
username to the point where it's like
what why can't I change my YouTube
username what if I go from you know
being a tech channel and I have like -
tech tips what if I want to start
vlogging because that is that not a
thing that I'm allowed to do I'm not
gonna start vlogging anytime soon but
but the way that we get like these
arbitrary decisions that never used to
like you used to just go oh yeah I'll
create a new hotmail account for you
know whatever flavor of the month stupid
move the cow at hotmail.com or or
whatever right like you didn't really
think about it all of a sudden these
things are catching up to us you know
seven years later so the Facebook Terms
of Service requires you to use a real
name so to be able to regain access to
her locked account she changed her name
on credit cards that was not enough so
she officially changed her name
via deed poll to regain access to her
account absolutely ridonculous
and speaking of redonkulous i guess this
will actually be the official statement
this will actually be the last article
for the day and this news item comes
right off of Thermaltake dot-com I think
you guys probably already know what I'm
referring to what I'm referring if
you've been following the whole thermal
fake Fiasco that went on around the
Computex timeframe with case labs
calling out Thermaltake as ripping off
their design so this is a press release
from yesterday case lab since right on
the Thermaltake website boy are they
proud of this because they said almost
nothing like mum was the freakin word
when this whole thing was going down
case lads apologizes for accusations
against Thermaltake so case labs has
issued a letter of retraction and
apology for its recent attacks upon
competitor Thermaltake
another manufacturer of computer cases
and other computer components recently
some of their personnel including blah
blah blah blah blah posted a tax upon
thermaltake these attacks have included
accusations that Thermaltake and one of
its employees shannon robbed which was a
real bummer I like Shannon he's a nice
guy stole case labs design and engaged
in unfair competition
case labs now regrets those statements
and apologizes for making them Wow
how much more like how much deeper could
the bad blood run between case labs and
Thermaltake I'm guessing the lawyers
were involved in this whole process
I'm guessing that case labs with gritted
teeth issued this particular apology
because they certainly weren't happy
about the whole you know thermal takes
designs looking admittedly very very
similar to some of case labs designs but
we've covered this on the land shield
before the cold hard truth of the matter
is that there really isn't a whole lot
that you can protect about the IP of
something like a computer case you know
like look at an techs recent what are
they calling that signature s10 so it's
called yeah you look at the signature
s10 which I actually saw for the first
time in person today you know you can't
you can't you can't patent you know
crazy thick aluminum panels if someone
else decides that that's a good idea
which they probably won't they might
they can manufacture a case like that
and there's not really a whole lot you
can do I think Josh from fractal put it
best there's only so many ways you can
build a black box and you know have it
not look you know the same as other
black boxes so I'm actually for the
first time in a very long time
completely out of topics for today why
don't we do a Twitter blitz yeah yeah
let's do it ten minute Twitter blitz
over 7,200 live viewers on the LAN show
for this special edition broadcasting to
you live from the NCIX studio so Twitter
blitz time here we go mentions Wow not
tech related are you a fan of Game of
Thrones that is a great question I read
the first book and I loved it I finished
it after having bought the Kindle
editions of the first five and realized
after finishing it that george RR martin
had written the last couple of books yet
I got super pissed off because I like to
binge consume things which it's just
it's my way I like to binge and I vowed
to not glance at the
those books that I have already paid for
and will read at some point I refuse to
glance at them until I have read them
all or he dies and I've read as many as
exists and I refuse to watch the show
until I have read all the books so I
absolutely love Game of Thrones but I'm
mostly completely ignorant about it so
there you go
funny question asked a funny question
get a funny answer next car you plan on
buying after the Civic kicks the bucket
actually I just bought a car it's I it's
sitting out in the back I bought my
parents old suzuki xl7 because I needed
something that could pull a trailer and
they were selling it for $4,000 it's
like I want to say it's a thousand nine
with a hundred eighty thousand
kilometers on it that's in like I know
it's all highway kilometers cuz I know
that they basically just drive up and
down from the cabin in it so I needed
something that could haul a trailer so I
will I will be I will be trying to sell
the Civic to Ed's allure something
because he just got his driver's license
so I don't know if I was supposed to
break the news Edsel finally has a
driver's license I think a big part of
it was that our new office is not very
accessible via transit so Terence
solution was to move it and this is this
is this is horrible
so Terence solution was to move into a
new place really close to the new office
but not that close to the old office and
then the construction project got to
laid by like three months so he's been
riding his bike 45 minutes each way for
like months thinking that we were moving
in in like a month so ed zl-- has gone
ahead and bought a car um ok next
question over 7000 viewers whoa yeah
it's not really a question uh watching
the LAN show also not a question but
thank you for the shoutout
JD Tom Hutchinson Hutchison Hutchison a
peppermint scented butthole is the kind
of butthole I want yes it is my question
is why is your background that color
because I am in a strange and foreign
land
alright why is getting a shirt from
Canada so much more expensive than
normal
already have three of your shirts
because Canada is Canada and shipping is
really expensive we're used to being
bent over on shipping whether we have to
ship something somewhere else or whether
we have to pay for shipping for someone
else to send it to us unless it's coming
from like Hong Kong where the government
is subsidizing shipping it costs a lot
of money to ship in to her out of Canada
Cooper asks how did you get into IT
reading forums and participating on
forums believe it or not Daniel asks
how's it going pretty darn good Daniel
pretty darn good Brianna asked so when
are you making more cat videos I
actually don't have any cat videos on
the plan my cats the second I turn on
the camera they're like my kids they'll
be doing something like super cute and
funny and then I'll be like okay please
keep doing that and it's like the second
I pull out the camera they stop so it's
just like you know what screw you cat

shot and you lose yourself in the moment

better never let that go yeah that's
what I said
all right AJ says I have a business
offer for you will you pay for the
transport I've no idea you're talking
about Matt here's a question from my
engineering teacher isn't vr headsets
making people feel nauseated a good
thing as in is it immersive no that's a
terrible terrible thing because nausea
is not reality so virtual reality
shouldn't be nauseating I hope that
explained it any more build bugs in the
pipeline yes I actually have some pretty
cool stuff planned so I'm gonna be
building a rig on the bottom of a desk I
have ordered all of the mounting
hardware that I need for that it's gonna
be a pretty sick desk from updesk
so yeah stay tuned for that one I also
heard from a little birdie that I'm
gonna be getting one of the first in
existence oh crap

blob or a build guide in that so stay
tuned for that yes things are happening

me have to google that oh dang it there

believe sin Taryn would be willing to
drive any car other than a Toyota Camry
his father had a Camry and it served his
father welfare for Taryn wants a Camry
that my friends is Taryn logic this is
what we have to work with around here
what do you think about a ps4 budget
gaming pcs I think it's a really good
thing although I think Amy's only got a
generation or two left before Intel
completely surpasses them at all budgets
they're our latest onboard graphics
they're looking really good z biggie
says you should be sponsored by Dollar
Bird Club you know I really don't know I
really don't know how that would go
because dolly beard Club has no
affiliation to my knowledge with Dollar
Shave Club and they kind of like and
like you can't patent like a stick but
like dollar beard club kind of ripped
off Dollar Shave club's stick and like I
I don't know it seems kind of weird to
me the divine gamer asked for tips on an
IT career similar to mine
what IT career is similar to mine who
does this job I'm not even sure I have
an IT job like the way that I see my job
is like it's like I I'm an entertainer
I'm an educator I'm uh I'm uh I'm a
business owner now we have nine people
working at Linus Media Group like my job
is and sometimes like I really am i
teeing it up all day like this week I've
gotten very little video stuff done
because I've been busy working on our
new workflow for video editing which is
only sort of IT stuff that's like
content creation stuff and and so I've
been setting up virtual machines on the
on the 36 core server seeing if running
multiple instances of Adobe Media
encoder
we'll watch folders can give us better
efficiency than Sorenson squeeze server
and like trying all this different stuff
so like I do that stuff still sometimes
but like I don't even know what my job
is half the time and I wear a lot of
different hats I don't really have a
favorite APU yes we are moving all of
our workstations to Windows 10 as soon
as we verified that Adobe Creative Cloud
is gonna run okay on Windows 10 I'm
really excited for the whole fresh slate
thing that's gonna be going on at the
new office new organizational cabinets
for all of our gear you know new
well-designed sets instead of just a
pile of boxes behind me you know
upgrading the workstations to Titan X's
that's gonna be awesome
the new workflow with offloading footage
having it duplicated having it
replicated right when we offload so we
don't have to leave stuff on SD cards
and then not know whether it's safe to
erase an SD card like all of these
things fresh windows it's gonna be part
of the fresh experience I'm really
excited and the new yeah the new plate
system I actually just moved my personal
workstation to Windows 10 as part of a
personal rig update that's going to be
coming on vessel this weekend
so I installed the RTN and then I'm
gonna I just skipped the product key
entry so I'm just gonna buy myself a
product key as soon as as soon as you
can go buy one moving date for the new
office tom not a hundred percent sure
yet favorite food Wow good question um
really love my wife's pasta yeah there
we go
where am i hiding Luke yeah no I
couldn't hide Luke well I could hide
parts of Luke if you know what I mean
but his whole self is up at a music
festival but hold on a second oh we just
revealed something I'm sure so there you
go that I just revealed oh no I didn't I
didn't reveal I didn't reveal anything
with that calendar pop-up that's funny
ha so you can see that there's a super
fun if you look really closely over
there but you actually can't tell what
it is which is good because
I don't want to reveal what that
Superfund is gonna be because it's gonna
be super crazy fun so let's do let's go
back to Twitter here what is your
favorite console the Super Nintendo
because it has the greatest game of all
time Final Fantasy 6 would you say the
Droid turbo is still worth it
the camera is subpar especially the
launch time in the shutter speed that's
a big problem I have with the droid
turbo it did finally get a lollipop
update but that really doesn't bode well
the fact that it took so long to get 5.1
really doesn't bode well for future
updates I still love it for the battery
life and I do like the ergonomics better
than the s6 active stay tuned for my s6
active review because I will definitely
be talking about s6 active versus droid
turbo because they've they're really
gonna be trading blows in a lot of
different ways I think that's pretty
much it for the show today guys actually
I think we're gonna go ahead and just
end Wow 7300 viewers I should broadcast
without Luke more often don't tell him I
said that he'll be all upset and you
know
I really don't understand what this plan
was exactly
I guess the NCIX guys wanted me to
disappear in a puff of smoke or look
like I farted a lot and it was cloudy or
like well the fans are on for one thing
so that's dispersing your smoke machine
smoke pretty quickly I think
so now they're firing the smoke machine
directly at my butthole which I guess
they're hoping will result in okay so
our sponsors today were people
watching guys and I'll see you next week
same bat-time same bat-channel yeah I
have the outro over the thing Jack tried
to poke his head into view and it didn't
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
