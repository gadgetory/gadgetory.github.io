cly is calling it a kick assist ebike
the perfect urban getaway and the most
wanted piece of transportation tech in
any city the concept here is simple the
smart ped will use its electric motor
not to accelerate but to maintain
whatever speed you kick it into up to 16
miles an hour and I must confess that it
does sound and look pretty cool
but is it cool and is it worth 1000 US
dollars
no it's not Intel brings ddr4 to the
mainstream with their new core i7 6700 K
and Core i5 6600 K processors check out
the link in the video description to
learn more you're a fly fly smart pick
at the plum wearing this yeah is it
funny or not Aaron you are funny it's
too late to change so originally linus
was going to review the smart ped but
when we got it both tires were
completely deflated which wouldn't have
been a problem except that the front
wheel has a Schrader valve while the
back wheel has a Presta valve what
and because the smart hub that powers
the rear wheel is in the way
there's so little space to insert a pump
and it's nearly impossible to inflate
this tire this was enough of an
inconvenience that Linus never got
around to fixing it and told me to
figure it out and do the review sure so
I picked up a Presta valve converter and
after trying about a dozen pumps I
finally found one that was low profile
enough to fit in here and inflate the
tire right so now let's charge it up
shall we
except I don't see anywhere to insert
the cable hmm and this thing didn't come
with a manual turns out that the charge
port is in the axle hidden underneath
this bolt ah okay so now we're ready to
go right we'll connect it with the
FlyFly app and nope the app doesn't
connect at all people sure aren't happy
about that more on this later
well let's just try it without the app
now the smart ped doesn't have a
throttle so you have to push off the
ground to get it going and it seems to
take several pushes but
right we'll engage the motor even
pushing with all my might
I've never been able to get the smart
ped to move very fast despite being well
under the weight limit and that's just
on level ground but going downhill is
also slow because of the regenerative
brake I wish I could just turn this
feature off furthermore even the
slightest uphill will slow it down
significantly and if it gets any steeper
the motor will shut off completely
you can try helping it along by pushing
with your leg but it's exhausting the
best way to get up a hill with the smart
ped is to get off and walk and sometimes
especially if you're going fast the
smart ped refuses to lock in any speed
at all so you'll just slow down until
you roll to a stop unless you kick off
to get the motor going again you see
because the smart pet doesn't have a
throttle control the smart hub wheel has
to guess how fast you want to go and it
has to guess whether you've applied the
brakes or not that's probably why it
just gives up when you encounter a hill
so much for all those fancy sensors and
programming so wherever you're going
you're going to be pretty sweaty by the
time you get there and I'm no
lightweight I ride a bike everywhere I
have never owned a car in my life so
when I say the smart pet is slow and
exhausting I mean it to quantify this I
decided to benchmark the smart pet and
compared to all the other vehicles we
have lying around the office so that's
my bicycle my crappy razor scooter the
Zboard electric skateboard lines
reviewed here and of course the
Lamborghini the course I chose for
testing begins at the office goes down
this long flat road then up a hill down
a hill around this roundabout and back
the same way to the office that's a
total of 2.2 kilometers Wow at ten
minutes for the round trip the smart pet
only beat the JD razor scooter which by
the way has no motor and only cost me
five bucks at a garage sale to make this
review i've been using the smart pet as
my daily driver instead of my bike for
all of my errands around town that's the
whole point right
cruising through the city or commuting
to work but it's not clear to me if the
smart pet is actually
vehicle or not it's way too slow for the
street but it's too fast for the
sidewalk making it feel dangerous both
ways hey also fly Kleiss says you can
take the smart pet on public
transportation but it doesn't fit in a
bike holder on the front of a bus and
most of the bus drivers I talked to
wouldn't even let me bring the smart ped
onto the bus even when folded up it's
just too big this one doesn't even have
a joint right here now it rains a lot in
the Vancouver area and the smart pet
appears to be resistant to rain which is
great but this regular version doesn't
have a back fender and this means that
the back of your pants will get
absolutely soaked with water and mud
even on short trips unless you MacGyver
yourself a solution out of a milk jug
like I did works pretty well actually by
this point in the review I realized that
I was supposed to be using the bit ride
app and not the fly clap which I learned
after finally getting my hands on the
pathetically short manual I tried a
couple of the different modes settling
on turbo mode which seems to help with
hill climbing a little bit but not much
I'd like to make some recommendations
for the fly glide 2 or whatever but I
don't know if there's any point because
basically the whole thing is bad and the
final conclusion about this product can
pretty much be summed up with one final
story from the two months I've been
using it I completed an entire trip with
the fly cly without realizing that a
small piece of wire had broken off
inside the power connector shorting it
out the smart pet motor wasn't even
working and I couldn't tell the
difference that combined with the
rusting body and foldable stem that
doesn't even lock in place sometimes
makes it impossible for me to recommend
the smart ped to anyone and from the
looks of the angry feedback from
Kickstarter backers both the ones that
did receive products and those who
didn't I'm not the only one disappointed
in the smart pad well thanks for
