powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is course our
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCI XCOM no I'm just kidding I'll
talk normally guys so we're here on the
be quiet booth where we've got some new
products to show off this one right here
is the be quiet pure power so it's not
really modular you know it's still got a
really nice look to it so you got to be
quiet fan in there of course these are
legendary fans very very as you may or
may not have guessed extremely noisy no
just kidding they're quiet okay so
there's that going for it non modular
power supply but what I like about this
one is it's meant to compete with
something like a builder series from
Corsair in terms of price and capacities
available and check this out be quiet
actually puts a reasonable number of
connectors on the thing it's a 600 watt
power supply that we have right here and
look at that four PCI Express six plus
two pin connectors very very nice the
problem with what most manufacturers are
doing these days is they're forgetting
that we're not dealing with pentium d
anymore
with fourth generation Core series
processors code-named has well as we
like to call them the power consumption
is actually so low unless you're
overclocking to an insane amount that
you could easily run to graphics cards
like 6600 TI or gtx 660ti s or something
along those lines with a
fourth-generation processor and you're
not going to exceed 600 watts so it's
great to see a power supply that
actually has the right number of
connectors for the kind of system you
can build with it these two things over
here aren't really new but this one is
this is the power zone so you can tell
from the styling this is gonna be more
for like your your show rig so you got
some cool textures on the side there
you've got some cool sort of grills on
the back there and then you've got haha
that's a silent wings 3 fan mm-hmm right
now silent wings 2 are the fans that are
out there in the market as standalone
this is a single rail power supply and
check this out it's 80 plus bronze so it
comes in at a pretty attractive price
point but you've still got support for a
bunch of really cool stuff like a fully
modular interface right here at
well as you see those fans ports you
have adapters that are included with the
power supply that allow your PSU to
actually control your case fans as well
so your power supply not only keeps
itself quiet but it also keeps the rest
of your system more quiet we're gonna
party like it's 3012 tonight we've got
oh wait no this is ah crap not about
this right this isn't body rock okay
this is the shadow rock to from be quiet
so this is a pretty big departure from
what we've seen in the past from them
for air coolers and one of the things
that you guys are gonna like about it in
terms of departure from the past is that
this is gonna be priced at 40 bucks u.s.
so it's a large quad thick heat pipe
tower cooler that's got a nice plate on
the top so it doesn't look sort of
ridiculous and it's also got a ton of
fan mounting options so on every corner
you've got room for these fan clips to
go either way so you never have to worry
about oh well you know I had to orient
my my CPU cooler this way so I wasn't
able to have like you know my fan
blowing towards wherever no you have the
option to put it wherever you want and
again the pricing is going to be very
very attractive this one right here is
intriguing to me this is the shadow rock
slim so what this does is it has okay so
it has smaller heat pipes but get this
this is Taiwanese made so it's
manufactured in Taiwan it uses higher
quality heat pipes this is actually the
same OEM that builds the heat pipes for
MacBook Pro so they're very high quality
heat pipes extremely high quality
materials get the same performance as
shadow rock to accept that because it's
so slim so they're using a custom 20
millimeter design for the fan so that
it's lower profile you can actually
install this in for example X 79
platforms where you have high profile
dims on either side or even on something
like a z87 platform where you want the
fan and you want your high profile dims
and you don't want to have any
interference whatsoever this one is
incredibly intriguing to me they've also
expanded the fan mounting clips on
something like the dark rock to it was a
little bit difficult you can really
mount two fans unless you would've
really did some modding but with this
one they've left the gaps open so you
could even install a couple of different
fans on it if you wanted thanks for
