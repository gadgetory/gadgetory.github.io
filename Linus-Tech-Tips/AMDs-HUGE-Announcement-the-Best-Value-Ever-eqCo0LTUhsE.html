laid plans of mice and men we're talking
a sixty email chain of you know the
videos that we're going to make here at
the tech day and there's a bunch of
complications so we figured out a
compromise AMD is giving us a worldwide
first exclusive piece of information it
is inside that door let's go find out
what it is
so we'll be sitting down with Raja
Kaduri here who is the lead of the
radion technologies group and we're
going to find out whatever it is this is
they won't tell me anything other than
that it's a big deal you know it's kind
of hitting great noise that's okay just
use my technique just kind of go low
yeah it's fine so what I'm assuming then
is the big reveal that you've got for me
is an enlightening story about the
subtle changes to the radion font um
that's actually the biggest story we got
I think that's that's confidential we
can't talk about it that thing okay well
what are we gonna do instead we got the
camera so you know what we are yeah yeah
I've heard of it
you heard of it have you tried I had to
take my vibe review unit back to the
office so that my VR editor could work
on it and it was one of the hardest
decisions I ever made
yeah so love ER yeah have you tried like
kind of like you know Google cardboard
or like gay we are type er yeah so what
I'm going to tell you Linus is that like
so there are kind of two kinds of we are
in the market okay so there is VR that
is I call it bad VR right but very
convenient because it's you can just
take your smartphone and put it inside
your Google cardboard and yeah and do
that kind of stuff so it's bad we are
that's very convenient and then there is
good we are right like what the stuff
that you see with HTC and an oculus
right it's very inconvenient and you ask
me why it's inconvenient it's because
you know it has tethering it has this it
has that but most important inconvenient
the good VR has is it's very expensive
oh I was going to say the worst thing is
that I have to explain to my wife that
I'm drilling holes in the wall to mount
my
this idea that two so there are a bunch
of inconveniences there and we have
taken a stance we want to get good VR to
over hundred million users right okay
and so we created a product you know
that begins that revolution to get good
we are two hundred million users the
cost of the PC today is one of the
biggest you know roadblocks for getting
hundred million PC users to have good VR
ok and and in the cost of the PC GPU
plays a big role right you know to play
good VR with HTC or oculus you have to
shell out over $400 today right ok so we
created this new technology very very
comfortable for good VR for 199 dollars
so that's the price that's the price
$1.99 $1.99 and you get awesome we are
you get like you know premium we call it
the you know the oculus and all call it
we are premium you get premium VR for
less than $200 for the first time in the
history of PCB are two hundred bucks so
do I get testing one yes you'll be one
of the first ones to get to see the one
very since the gift thing in there it's
in this beautiful
also very durable very durable right now
so this is it this is it this is the new
so he also is radiant who else outside
of AMD then and any other press he'll
help one yet nope you're the first one
you're the first one it's beautiful with
I like it you know teeny little six pin
coming it's been connector it's got
little power it's got the classic you
know EP extension at the PCB compensator
as I like to call it okay right and you
know very cool very quiet okay and
because you're using this FinFET
technology right in the new architecture
we have reduced the power for VR premium
solution to less than 150 watts so there
you have it the price of the RX 480 is
$200 so there you have it then guys you
heard it here first AMD is drop drop
drop in well lots of things but mostly
the barrier to entry for VR so thanks
