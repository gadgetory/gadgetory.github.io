triple or even quadruple your internet
speed with one easy trick well you'd
probably say yeah I've heard that before
this asshole told me to duct tape bye
built to my network cable they laughed
at me when my pants fell down but wait
this time it's actually real our
internet service provider here at Linus
Media Group I tell networks sent us this
fancy box that allows you to bond
together multiple internet connections
in what is effectively internet SLI and
I've been using it for the last three
months so let's talk about some pretty
cool network magic and how it works
G fuel is the sugar free alternative
energy beverage to maintain focus and
endurance over long days and gaming
sessions save some money using code
Linus at the link in the video
description let's get this out of the
way bonded Internet is faster but it is
not free if you've tried the free ways
to get faster internet you'll know that
they don't work anyway though so that
shouldn't come as much of a surprise so
what's the point of making this video
and what is the point of bonding it all
then Linus if I wanted a faster internet
connection I could just buy a faster
internet connection like you did no
voodoo required well there are a number
of reasons but I'll start with mine
since it actually covers a few of the
most common ones now the office here is
fine but at my house at the time of
setting this up the fastest download
speed I could get was a hundred megabit
and the fastest upload speed available
on a residential a DSL or cable line was
10 megabit which is great for uploading
the odd cat video to Facebook but I have
experienced some data loss scares
recently and I wanted to set up an
off-site backup for my storage box
meaning that I could easily be
transferring multiple gigs of data in a
single day and there
also the issue of dynamic IP addresses
even fairly basic uses like hosting an
FTP file server require a static IP
address to avoid unexpected downtime not
included with most residential
connections and then further
complicating matters many ISPs also
block some of the common ports
associated with hosting websites mail
servers or what have you
now you might think then that the
obvious solution would be to get a
business connection but while that would
give me a static IP and all of my ports
open for running servers or whatever
those cost significantly more than the
residential ones and to my shock and awe
are no faster or in Telesis case not
even available in my area at the same
speeds so given then that a fiber billed
out to my house would cost about as much
as a new car
ital suggested ordering multiple cheaper
residential connections to my house and
combining them but the only way that I
was aware of that that could work is
with a load balancing router it's a
relatively affordable piece of hardware
but one that's considered more
appropriate for failover
in the event that one connection goes
down or for distributing net traffic
across multiple users like for example
if two users are trying to watch to four
megabit streams that could work with two
five megabit connections but if one user
was trying to stack those two five
megabit connections and watch a single 8
megabit video stream load balancing
would not be the solution it turns out
that they were talking about bonding so
the first step was to convince Telus
that I actually needed to residential
lines to my house so I got two of the 50
down 10 up packages and the installers
helped me run the phone lines to my
server room insisting the whole time
that they'd be back in a week to take
one of them out when I found out that
this wasn't going to work this all took
place back when I was doing the
conclusion of personal rig update 2016
next I plugged both of those a DSL
modems into this black box it's not
actually black I'm just calling it that
because it's a mystery that I tell calls
the Bhandar they actually have ones with
six ports that can handle up to five
connections and 900 megabit symmetrical
traffic but mine is a fairly basic one
designed for two internet connections
than a single connection back to my
router which after configuring my new
static IP something the Telus Tech's
also insisted wouldn't work manages the
rest of my network exactly the way it
normally would I tell ask for about an
hour or so to do some tuning then I
downloaded a game off steam and boom 10
megabyte per second downloads as though
I was on a single connection but how can
that be for things like downloading
large files or watching streaming video
I mean I could imagine that I tells
blocks could have like large buffers
inside of it allowing it to sort of sort
and reassemble the data but that kind of
solution would work terribly for
real-time applications like online games
and they insisted it wouldn't add much
latency even which turned out to be true
well it's actually a lot closer to
alternate frame rendering SLI than it is
to how a load balancing router would
work instead of being based on a user
session individual packets are actually
divided completely equally between the
two connections so my game data stream
full of bunny hops and head shots goes
into the black box which splits it
evenly sends it across the internet to I
tells nearest data center from you
that's in Vancouver where a much more
powerful box called an aggregator sorts
it out accounting for small differences
in delivery time and forwards it in
order to wherever it's supposed to go at
least that's how it works when you have
two identical connections there is some
more latency and bandwidth overhead
involved in bonding connections with
different speeds let's say a
a 20 megabit and a 10 megabit and
bonding grossly different connections
like a 15 egg and a 5 Meg isn't
recommended at all but for my
application it is perfect and it works
exactly the same way in Reverse any game
website or online service I use has no
idea that I want to tell us connection
at all and only sees my static IP it
does cost money like I said the service
is billed completely separately from the
connections that you're bonding a couple
hundred dollars a month over the stand
alone cost in my case but there's other
cool stuff too
with multiple links you can operate in
bonding mode failover mode or something
in between so you could have like two
bonded ADSL lines and then a figgle over
LTE line that could switch seamlessly
without losing any uptime and other
business grade stuff we actually have an
affiliate link to I tell for the service
below the video like QoS services that
prioritize VoIP traffic that can be done
at the aggregator level but for me I
just wanted to stack data limits and
bandwidth caps something that could be
very useful for enthusiast consumers and
especially small businesses apparently
festivals and movie shoots are actually
asking them to bond together multiple
lte-a connections to get ballin 500
megabit internet in locations where
there aren't any wires and unlike some
of the other ways to get a better
connection without spending you know
could be tens of thousands of dollars on
a fiber installation it actually works
speaking of things that actually work
fresh books fresh books is the super
simple cloud accounting software that's
helping over five million small
service-based business owners conquer
their admin and paperwork in a lot less
time with way less stress giving them
more time to spend doing the actual work
instead of all of that stuff that they
don't like it takes about 30 seconds to
create and send a polished
professional-looking invoice you can
take pictures of your receipts
on your phone using fresh books is
mobile app and you can make claiming
your expenses a million times easier you

phone or your desktop meaning you'll
know who you did work for when you did
it and how much you did and if you have
any questions fresh books is
award-winning customer service is
amazingly helpful fresh books customers
on average save two days out of the

mean do you remember what weekend's were
you guys small business owners that's
right you could have a weekend a month
once again anyway for unrestricted
30-day full access as a free trial head

watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
even consider checking out the link in
the video description to where to buy
the stuff we've talked about usually on
Amazon but in this case it'll be the I
tell link I referred to before also in
the video description we've got our
merch store we've got our forum which
you can join and discuss with people
I've actually got our old non Amazon
affiliate compliance outro here this is
a video I had started a long time ago
and not finished so that's why this is
coming across kind of awkward but uh
