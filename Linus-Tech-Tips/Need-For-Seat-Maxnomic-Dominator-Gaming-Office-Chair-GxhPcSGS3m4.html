chair I mean computer stuff don't
problem for us we've got a review of
Silverstone's
awesome looking at 205 case coming soon
make sure you're subscribed so you don't
miss that but a chair well I guess
today's video is just going to be a
little different than isn't it
coolermaster neptune series CPU coolers
are available in a variety of radiator
sizes to perfectly suit your next build
click now to learn more we'll start with
the shopping experience color selection
was easy all their chairs look pretty
freakin awesome actually I went with an
orange and black color scheme very
similar to the Linus tech tips one model
selection though was where things got a
little bit tougher they have dxracer
chairs listed on the need for seat site
but the model names don't correspond to
the ones on dxracer zone website in any
meaningful way and when I contacted
dxracer about the naming and visual
similarities between the products they
denied any affiliation so I settled on
need for seats on max Nanak line which
based on the teardown on their site
versus copycat chairs looks pretty
freaking awesome you should check out
the teardown by the way if you get a
chance I didn't want to cut up my chair
because I plan on using it for years to
come but if their point is the
difference in materials and construction
that you get for an extra hundred
dollars versus a lookalike is worth it
then it comes across very well the
unboxing and assembly process only took
about half an hour even though I did it
myself and the manual suggests getting a
helper speaking of which the manual is
full color and I was really pleased with
it until I got to the part where it
broke the news to me that this is not in
fact a sex chair I tried pretty hard not
to hold that against the chair when I
was doing my sitting benchmarks but no
promises on to the evaluation of the
chair I'll start with my past experience
I've got a hundred ish dollar IKEA chair
that I use at the office everyday a 200
ish dollar leather Costco chair that I
use at home everyday and now I have a
300 plus dollar chair so the angle I'll
be tackling this from is what do you get
in terms of extra features and comfort
as you spend more money
HIDA just is pretty standard these days
and
the gas lift on the max Nanak only moves
about three inches I found that even
when it's bottomed out you don't get
that rock-hard feeling as you plunked
down into it so it's got a wider usable
range than my other chairs where I have
to leave a bit of an air cushion at the
bottom at all times I did find the lever
a bit tough to reach compared to the
other designs though and on that note
this seems like a good time to check out
the other leaders that are down here the
one on the left is Aileen Locke but I
left this off because there's a knob on
the bottom that you can turn to adjust
the tension of the lien so I set it up
so that it was basically impossible for
me to lean the chair accidentally but
easy to do it on purpose with my feet up
under my desk the way I sometimes like
to sit when I'm writing the last leader
is back over on the right and controls
the recline feature it's a little
disconcerting at first being able to
lean so far back in a chair but even
with the stock base they have a heavier
duty one I didn't feel like there was
any risk of me falling over it's got
like 12 steps four of which at the
beginning are completely unusable see
wait really and then combined with the
included head pillow I'd say it's
legitimately comfortable enough to sleep
in if you're into that and you're alone
which leads us to overall comfort I
usually don't do eight hour marathon
sits but even since I've gotten it I've
had a couple days where I've been
sitting for three plus hours at a time
and that's where I often run into
trouble with my buns falling asleep in
my other chairs because when I've gone
shopping for chairs in the past I looked
for soft cushioning and the problem with
the chairs i buy is that after half an
hour to an hour
you're basically sitting on the plywood
inner material because the cushion is so
easy to push through while the Dominator
doesn't feel like sitting on a cloud or
anything the cushioning is so thick and
has enough strength to it that even
though it's not goose down I can't get
through it to the inner structure so
there's always some padding which
allowed my buns to stay awake much
better and I also found that sitting on
something that's comfortable but not
soft made my sitting position naturally
better somehow I mean I'm still not
Percy perfect posture by any stretch but
small improvements can add up to a lot
when you step
a long time in your chair I didn't find
their lumbar support pillow that useful
because it moved around a fair bit when
I got up and sat back down on the chair
but the chair is plenty comfortable
without it anyway and I did find the
headrest one was a little bit more
useful on to the arm rests they're kind
of Awesome actually they have a ton of
adjustments they can go up and down they
can go I can find all these buttons in
real time here they can go side to side
whatever will do this in b-roll they can
go side to side they can be angled in
and out and they can go forward and back
it's a feature I normally don't find
myself using much these adjustments you
just kind of set it and forget it but
with how quick it is to adjust
particularly the height I actually found
myself raising my mouse arm so I'd have
a nice flat again cushioned but not
overly comfortable platform to rest my
elbow on then tucking them down and
moving my chair in whenever I needed to
do some serious typing again little
ergonomic improvements that helped over
time speaking of time I guess its
conclusion time the worst thing about
this chair has got to be the shopping
experience need for seat needs to add a
comparison tool or a shopping helper
wizard to their site because for most
people the differences in features will
not be the main deciding factor and
getting the size and weight suggestions
right will be more important they're
less expensive casual sport model may
have actually been a better fit for me
but I didn't realize that until after
this one had already arrived in spite of
it being a little bit big for me though
it's very comfortable and even though it
uses fake leather rather than natural
leather the inside materials make up for
this in my mind and I'll be using this
chair as my new daily driver at work but
the real test of course will be what we
go with when it's time to equip everyone
in the office with better chairs so stay
tuned because we want to try out some
other options and once we've made a
decision
we will definitely update you guys with
