2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair alright guys i'm sure you guys
remember as tez this was one of our
favorite games from pax prime in the
mega booth and what they're here again
so i was actually just wondering what
have you guys improved in this game over
that amount of time one of the biggest
things i think we've done is we brought
the oculus with us the PAX Prime it was
a really really successful thing that we
did it was people loved it and so I've
actually built environment since then
built for the oculus so you'd never know
it if you're just playing the game on a
regular TV but once you pop on the
oculus in these new environments you can
look around and you're completely inside
of this like immersive a sec environment
whereas before there wasn't really
anything buying the camera so that's one
of the biggest things we've done apart
from that I mean it's been a huge
restructuring of the games weapons we've
done a lot of balance changes the
enemies they act totally different now
but in a really good way so just in
general too much tighter experience
that's awesome and especially the Octans
part I really appreciate that because
when we came and played here before it
was cool but it still looks like you
were looking at a platform and now it's
much more like you're actually in the
environment which is an awesome
improvement and then you said you were
bringing it to more platforms right like
different consoles why not yeah so
instead of just being steam which we you
know was the original plan we actually
recently announced that we're coming to
the Xbox one the ps4 do we you and the
vita so we're gonna launch on Steam
first and then after you know after a
month or two and we've got a little bit
of money come in we're hitting every
single console so yeah we're we're
really excited about that so it'll be
everywhere that's really cool as you
guys know I'm a big fan of pc components
considering we're a part of my
detectives but I might have to try this
out on the wii u because i love we you
and I this this game feels like it's
made for the wii u so i'm going to have
to try that out thanks for showing us as
