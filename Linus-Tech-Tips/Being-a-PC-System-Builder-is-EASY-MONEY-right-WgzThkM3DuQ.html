right by parts on Newegg borrow a
folding table from your mom download
pirated Windows to save a buck and put
an ad on Craigslist I mean how could
potential customers resist well like
anything it's not as simple as it looks
from the outside Puget systems is
workstations and gaming computers might
not be obviously different from any
other PC but I can pretty much guarantee
that every one of you will see something
inside there Auburn Washington
headquarters that you weren't expecting
our story begins well in the bathroom
actually I mean what so long drive down
here from Vancouver so for real though
any system starts with configuration
we've all seen that stupid post on a
forum with like a ten thousand dollar
machine where you can tell that
obviously it was just a list of all the
most expensive components and every drop
down on PC part picker glued together
and then it's like hey guys is this good
for gaming and it's just like yeah yeah
it'll run Crysis or whatever but in many
cases it would actually be slower than a
system that costs a fraction as much so
in what they call the lab puget
technicians look at real-world workloads
for their workstations like Unreal
Engine unity Autodesk and Adobe Premiere
and After Effects to determine what
Hardware hits the sweet spot for price
to performance because as we discovered
when we were trying to measure the
benefits of a hundred and twenty eight
gigs of system ram here reading outdated
foreign posts doesn't work as a way to
configure a system I mean Adobe
after-effects went from scaling across
multi cpu-z on systems three years ago
to now hugest recommends you throw in a
quad core and call it a day
and with this knowledge puget designs
the purpose-built systems that you can
find on their site and trains their
technology consultants so-called because
they don't get a commission for how much
you spend and this is also where they
find the weird bugs one new CPU was
crashing after about 10 seconds and
it'll be premiere with the warp
stabiliser effect enabled well it ended
up being a motherboard issue that has
since been fixed with a new BIOS that
anyone can download and if you think
that's cool it actually gets better
instead of protecting all of their
knowledge and keeping it behind closed
doors puget publishes a
ton of the work that they do in here
through the article section of their
website it was actually a puget article
that helped me diagnose the unexpectedly
poor video encoding performance on my 22
core Xeon in this video here and today
alone Matt here released four articles
about the After Effects Premiere and
Photoshop performance of skylake X
versus thread Ripper so go check them
out if you're a Creative Cloud user next
stop the warehouse all the inventory
that they need to smooth out delivery
during periods of oh I don't know let's
say high GPU demand due to mining get
stored along this back wall here and if
you appreciate simple professional
design you'll feel right at home here
there's a wonderful selection of black
cases black power supplies black coolers
and brown coolers with no RGB in sight
and this cabinet looks already done so
from there the inventory management and
purchasing team picks out the components
for each system and puts them into a bin
for the assembly team every machine
whether it's a basic gaming box a 3d
animation workstation or a quad socket
data-crunching tower for scientific
research gets hand-built by a single
technician who is responsible for
adhering to puget strict quality
standards every screw needs to be
tightened every port needs to be
connected and well you won't find any
part line water-cooled battle stations
here they do adhere to strict standards
when it comes to cable management all of
this gets checked first by another tech
then by QA in the hot room so-called
because even in the winter all the
burnin testing that they do in here
keeps it pretty toasty how toasty
exactly though well after being loaded
up with an operating system and software
that's specific to the type of
workstation being
built for validation at one of the two
epic 16 monitor battle stations in the
very center of Puget sylheti each system
gets hits thermals measured through
software at idle and full load using
something like prime95
and fur mark as well as through hardware
using a FLIR thermal camera so any
abnormal hot spots can be located and
diagnosed it was actually partly Puget
stess ting that determined that many
reports of x 299 motherboard vrm
failures were being caused by accidental
overclocking due to misconfigured turbo
boost 3.0 profiles it's also in here
that acoustics and system benchmarks are
compared against an internal database of
thousands of other systems to ensure
that everything is behaving normally
speaking from experience this next bit
is one of the most difficult problems
for any system builder to solve shipping
PCI slots were originally designed for
cards that looked more like this not for
the multi pound copper monstrosity that
are so common today that's why puget has
their own laser cutter where they
fabricate all kinds of things vanity
plates for motherboards and a i/o liquid
coolers this actually kind of sexy
looking prototype case and perhaps most
importantly all manner of support
brackets for their systems the old way
was to stuff them full of expanding foam
but it turns out that customers would
sometimes call them years later my
sister makes a ticking noise and it runs
really hot what can I do and I'd be like
oh you should take out the foam that's
been in there all this time
so with braces like this everything is
ready to go out of the box with no
intervention needed from the customer
and they look kind of cool to every
system is packed with care and comes
with a little booklet chock full of
information about puget steam
for getting started like login
instructions for Linux systems
screenshots of the recommended BIOS
settings benchmarks thermals and even
baby photos of your new PC but don't
think for a second that that last one is
all about sentimentality it turns out
that it's an invaluable troubleshooting
tool if you call in like two years later
wanting to put in another hard drive and
they want to walk you through where to
plug everything in which I guess brings
us to tech support physically to tech
support both phone support and physical
upgrades and repairs are handled here in
Seattle by a team that's trained by the
lab folks upstairs to be familiar each
one of them with both basic Hardware
diagnosis and at least one software
specialty like content creation
engineering or scientific so if you call
in chances are there will be someone who
knows what you're talking about so at
the end of the day we wouldn't do a
sponsored piece like this with just any
system builder because it's pretty easy
for it to come across as an endorsement
but we've known these guys for a long
time I'm actually ok with that the
biggest thing is that Puget isn't
drinking their own kool-aid they don't
pretend that their computer is made of
some kind of magic that makes it perform
better than an identical box that you
built yourself with the same components
and they don't refer to benchmarking
components that work and assembling
systems as engineering they believe that
their value is right there in the
mission statement that's vinyl on the
wall and that's something that I can get
behind so thanks for watching guys if
you just like this video you can hit
that button but if you liked it hit the
like button get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link below also
down there is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join it's probably also going to be a
link to Flo plane which by the way we
were joking we're joking he's
working on floatplane he doesn't work at
Puget let's just let's get that covered
