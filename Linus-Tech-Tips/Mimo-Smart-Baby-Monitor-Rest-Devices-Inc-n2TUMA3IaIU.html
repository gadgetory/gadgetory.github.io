uninitiated among you stick around for a
second and I'm gonna open your mind you
know when you put gaming edition and
some flashing LEDs on something it makes
it worth twice as much for some reason
putting four babies on something
automatically makes it an order of
magnitude more expensive eight pound box
of rags for cleaning tough spills like
paint 25 bucks special rags with
adorable phrases on the front for
cleaning spittle and mushed Peas Wow a
whole 3-pack for only $20 however will
you make a profit on that all right so I
guess you get the point parents are used
to getting fleeced on anything that
someone can convince them makes life
better for their little bundle of joy so
when I saw the MIMO smart baby monitor
with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi powered by
Intel Edison the geek in me when oh em
gee it goes on my baby and it has
Bluetooth and freakin Wi-Fi are you
freaking kidding me sign me up while the
parent in me went really another $200
for like a starter pack are you kidding
me oh well I guess I could sell my 5960
ex and get a Pentium anniversary edition
and then I could have this for my baby
which by the way we'll be doing a
head-to-head comparison table soon in
gaming so make sure you're subscribed
for that and then I click the checkout
button so here we go is the rest devices
Nemo an amazing blend of Technology and
cuteness or is it another scam to steal
copious amounts of money from casuals
just like Fitness wearables let's find
out shall we
Corsair gaming RGB keyboards feature
precision Cherry MX RGB key switches for
sixteen point eight million color perky
backlighting for virtually unlimited
customization click now to learn more
well begin with what you get in the
starter box a lily pad that charges the
monitoring turtle and acts as a wireless
communications base station for Wi-Fi to
interact with your phone and bluetooth
for the turtle a wall wart and flat
green USB cable to power the lily pad a
three-and-a-half millimeter audio cable
that you'll use to program the lily pad
and three cotton machine washable
onesies or kimonos in either 0 to 3 3 to
6 or 6 to 12 month sizes and of course
the aforementioned Bluetooth turtle I
guess that's also in there put in the
kimono on is as easy as any other baby
clothing so a piece of cake if she's not
fussing and squirming but otherwise a
bit more challenging just layer down on
it put our arms through the appropriate
openings do up the two buttons on the
right side do up the buttons on the left
side then pull the bottom under the
diaper and do up those three buttons at
the front if you can I've been using
these kimonos for a couple weeks so
they've been through the washer and
dryer and even though my little one is a
bit tall for her age my not quite three
month old is not really fitting the
three to six month onesies very well
they're quite snug and I think it would
be a bit better if they were preshrunk
out of the box to give a better idea of
what sizing will be like so I left the
three bottom ones undone in my testing
let's move on to the app which is
available for iOS and Android go through
the wizard to create an account and then
use the three-and-a-half millimeter
cable with the volume turned up to max
on your phone to connect the lily pad to
your home Wi-Fi network and bind your
lily pad and turtle to the phone with
the codes on the bottom all of which
worked pretty seamlessly on iOS between
my Droid turbo and One m8 and Xperia z2
I borrowed and my wife's Moto G only two
of them were able to program the lily
pad but the good news is that the share
feature makes it easy to add another
device for monitoring that can't program
it or just a device that would have
worked but one that belongs to a less
tech-savvy parent or caregiver so I used
that to generate a custom link that I
emailed to my wife so she could easily
maaan
the same turtle on her Android phone
next to share is the alert button which
lets you toggle your notifications on
iOS and configure them on Android so
you'll be warned about various baby
status changes but it didn't work very
well on had Troy - unfortunately
overriding muted system volume so it
actually as she stirred a little bit
pudding when my wife was putting the
baby down to sleep after rocking her it
detected a wake event causing her phone
in her pocket to go off and actually
wake the baby again
iOS didn't have that problem though then
there are three tabs at the bottom the
live monitor tab shows you the position
the babies in monitors her temperature
and the temperature of the room that the
lilypad is in and as well as letting you
listen like a normal baby monitor by
pressing the play button
but while the position detection works
reasonably well for rolling it's pretty
useless for upright detection the and
the wakefulness detection is actually
much worse reporting that the baby is
asleep when she's doing anything from
fussing on the ground to sitting in a
chair to being rocked by yours truly and
then the audio quality for the listen
button is so terrible on the monitor
compared to my cheapo baby monitor from
Toys R Us that I wouldn't consider it a
substitute at all the timeline tab is
much less refined and it's kind of
clunky looking on Android and lacks the
summary on the bottom that makes it
somewhat useful but on iOS it actually
gives you a pretty good look at recent
sleeping and waking events on a little
timeline which is a neat idea if you
want to monitor baby's sleep schedule to
try to optimize it but the problem is
that while sometimes it works the sleep
monitoring and orientation monitoring is
so unreliable but I wouldn't count on
this to give me any kind of useful
information about my child's activity
levels and obviously won't do anything
while the turtle which needs to be
charged every couple of days is not
connected to the kimono so it's again
not the kind of thing that I would rely
on and the third tab is settings where
you can see some tutorials manager
multiple lily pads and turtles if you
have twins are very heavily invested in
this monitoring ecosystem manage the
notifications that get sent and changed
the monitoring temperature units or at
least on iOS you can do that
so at this point you're probably sitting
there thinking g-line is cute baby
thanks by the way
but that Nemo thing looks pretty rubbish
for something that you will get maximum
one year of use out of even if you're
willing to keep investing in more
onesies and only onesies for 15 bucks a
pop and Linus you're in pretty good
spirits for someone who just basically
threw away $200 of your hard-earned
money as far as I can tell what's up and
the answer is it's nothing personal
against rest devices Inc specifically or
even smart baby monitors in general but
I'm actually happy because this product
gave me an opportunity to make a little
PSA about enticing new tech products
especially lifestyle ones from companies
that have no proven track record that
hopefully you'll share with others you
know when someone is trying to sell you
something based on your insecurities and
fears things like fitness trackers that
help you lose weight or baby monitors
that give you peace of mind take a
moment and put on your common sense
goggles and critical analysis caps and
try and cut through the BS peace of mind
from what okay so focusing back in on
baby monitors here we know that monitors
don't prevent SIDS so what are you
preventing other than your own anxiety
and is conquering that anxiety just a
natural step in the process of learning
to be a parent are we using these
gadgets as a crutch are they even a
useful crutch if they don't even work
that well am I really gaining any peace
of mind from something that doesn't even
appear and monitor the baby correctly I
mean I don't know I think to be clear
I'm not saying that every product is
terrible you know like my
battery-powered audio baby monitor is
super handy just cuz it's not always
convenient to room share with the baby
it's nice to be able to go about your
day with a thin clip to your belt loop
and know when the baby's waking but you
know and who knows this sprout laying
ankle bracelet thing might be amazing
but all I'm trying to say is be patient
take the time to find some proper
independent media coverage or user
reviews of the finished version of this
stuff before pre-ordering like everyone
seems to be willing to do you're going
to keep paying $200 for half-baked
products like Nemo that in this case
aside from their software just being
plain
not good enough for a finished product
it just wasn't even that thought-out in
the first place I mean the turtle
communicates with the lilypad via
bluetooth so the range drops out like
basically outside the room and how is
this useful if the baby is asleep in any
of the places that a baby might fall
asleep
other than her crib like dirt what am I
gonna do move around the entire station
whenever I go anywhere so that I can
track her weight Felicity she's awake
and says she's sleeping I don't know so
I think that's pretty much all I had to
say about this guy's thanks for watching
like if you liked dislike if you just
like leave a comment letting me know if
you've been suckered into buying some
kind of baby gadget or gizmo that didn't
end up being that useful and if you
