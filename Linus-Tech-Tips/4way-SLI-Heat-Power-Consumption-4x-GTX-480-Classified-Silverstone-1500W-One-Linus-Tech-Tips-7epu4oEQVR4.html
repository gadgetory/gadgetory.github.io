set up video for the four-way SLI here
and I just wanted to address some of the
naysayers in my comments who are telling
me oh no 1500 watts is not nearly enough
for four-way SLI every card consumes 400
watts or something along those lines to
which I say fat not true um actually
this power supply the strider 1500 watt
is more than adequate to power this
system
and to demonstrate that i will just show
you rather than tell you about it so
first of all why don't we have a look at
our GPU idle temperatures which you can
see are in the 60 60 degree or so range
and the system actually isn't even that
loud right now now i don't have the
video cards overclocked or anything
crazy like that at the moment however
you know that's something that i may
play around with in the future
i also had a couple people ask me to
download the latest driver which i have
done and so you can see that the only
outputs that i can use are these ones in
these ones so card one and card three I
don't know if 3d vision surround is
available yet in fact I'm pretty sure
it's not till the next driver release
but you you will be able to run 3d
vision surround with three monitors
hooked up to the two cards in the future
so I'm running maximum 3d performance
and I am not dedicating any particular
GPU to the physics in fact why don't we
just set the CPU to oh whatever forget
it okay we'll just leave it how it was
cancel anyway so let's run 3dmark
Vantage and have a look at just how much
power consumption we're going to be
looking at with the system like this I
should also mention the CPU is
overclocked to four gigahertz so the
base well the video cards are going to
be as not bottlenecked as is possible
with a rig like this it is still on the
loading screen actually this might take
a little while because 3dmark Vantage
takes forever to load but we're
consuming about 700 watts at the wall
right now now here's something I should
explain when you're consuming 700 watts
at the wall that does not mean you need
a 700 watt power supply that means a 700
watt power supply would be
borderline but it would definitely work
because power supplies are rated for how
much DC wattage they can output whereas
this measurement is how much AC wattage
is going in so a power supply that's
rated for 1000 watts DC at 80 plus so
let's say it's 80% efficiency would
actually be able to supply a system
that's drawing up to about 1150 1200
Watts from the wall so this is only
about a 500 watt power supply that could
be running oh there we go 3d kicked in
we're over a thousand watts now so that
means that actually we could run this
system like like borderline borderline
run the system on probably an 850 900
watt power supply now I've actually seen
it I've run this benchmark already and
I've seen it peak up to 1,100 watts but
this should pretty much address everyone
who's telling me that the 1500 watt
power supply is not enough because the
1500 watt power supply is probably
actually operating at peak efficiency
right now with a system that draws about
800 watts 1500 watt power supply is
looking at about 60 percent load so
thank you for checking out my video
today on the power consumption and heat
of four-way SLI in fact wait wait
there's more
don't go away yet because let's have a
look at what the lobe temps are going to
be on these video cards when we're
actually running a 3d application so
this isn't going to be quite a
worst-case scenario because the air is
quite cool here and we've only been
running the game for a little while so
it would probably take another five
minutes or so to actually get a proper
load temperature but it'll be pretty
close what do we got here Wow so they go
up to actually these were still rising
so it's very hard to say what they'd
peak at but maybe I'll do a separate
video on that but it looks like they
went up as high as 85 degrees on my top
GPU and that's the hottest one by a long
shot
oh well by one degree anyway so there
thanks for checking out my video on the
four-way SLI rig</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
