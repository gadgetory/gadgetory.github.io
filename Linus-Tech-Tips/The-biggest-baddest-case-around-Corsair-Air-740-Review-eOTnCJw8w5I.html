air 540 cubed case was released into the
wild and in that time we've stopped
doing unboxings like this one I mean he
doesn't even build a computer in it what
is that
Corsair forgot about cases for a while
and then they finally launched this the
air 740 now the air 540 was an
interesting case whose big selling
feature a dual chamber design for
excellent airflow and loads of cable
management room worked well but it left
some people wanting more especially in
the fan filter department so has Corsair
met these desires and brought the
features up to the same modern aesthetic
that the 740 has let's find out
mass drop is featuring the AKG K 5 v 3
Pro Studio Headphones featuring over-ear
closed-back construction check them out
in the link in the description down
below now I talked of the modern looks
of the air 7:40 in the intro I think
it's like some kind of awesome mix
between a server and a kegerator let's
start with the front interrupting one of
the cross blades which is what I guess
I'll call the cool things that go across
the front of the case is a large set
power button down a bit from there and
you have in a row from left to right a
reset button 2 USB 3 ports headphone and
microphone jacks and an LED switch which
can be used with Corsairs new SP 120 and
HD 120 RGB fan controller though it
should be noted you'll need to buy these
separately if you want to see this
functionality in more detail we should
have a PAX West coverage video
showcasing it by the time this video is
released so go check that out if you're
interested
below these is a little removable panel
which wasn't mentioned anywhere in the
reviewers guide or manual and all
Corsair would tell me when I
interrogated them about it was that it's
a potential front panel expansion module
so we're guessing it may be a fan
control module or something and V are
friendly cases are a thing now so maybe
an HDMI port another thought we had was
that it could be an intentionally blank
spot so people can 3d print their own
logos and stuff I don't know we'll have
to wait and see behind the front panel
which is just easy enough to remove
without worrying about it ever falling
off is a big fan filter with a well
implemented magnetic mounting system so
we're looking good on the whole fan
filter thing so far moving on the top of
the case very much resembles the front
with the cross blade ESCA design I'll be
it slightly less pronounced along with
some meshing to cover where the fans
will breathe through I think it's well
implemented and looks pretty awesome but
maybe not something I'd Rock on a daily
driver system though I'd love to hear
your thoughts in the comments the bottom
of the case pretty much resembles the
top plus an arrangement of solid case
feet the left side panel is a large
see-through plexi
glass window interrupted only by the
handle release on the right hand side
once opened it can be easily lifted off
of its hinges so you don't have to
bother with it while you're actually
building the system the right side panel
is mostly plain but also includes a
filtered cutout area for your power
supply to breathe through although the
filter holes are so large that I would
expect that they're mainly going to be
stopping spiders and flies from going
into your power supply instead of dust
perhaps that's a problem at coursera HQ
so more fan filters they fix the fan
filter problem then
well they improved it but didn't in my
opinion completely solve it the front
intakes and power supply intake are
filtered as I previously mentioned but
the top and bottom sections remain bare
it's a hundred and fifty US dollar case
and at that price I expect filters
wherever they could be a fan note that
could be used as an intake anyways now
that we're inside we get to see that
there is a ton of cable management holes
and really nice rubber grommets
scattered everywhere that you could need
them and there is so much room I found
the air 7:40 easy to build into the
point where it was rather relaxing like
the comfy couch of computer cases even
just down to things like the graphics
card mounting screws being inside the
case instead of outside it's not a huge
deal but I do prefer it that way
moving in behind the motherboard we have
yet again so much room you can mount
three hard drives and four SSDs all in
their respective to list trays while
just absolutely not caring about cable
management because there isn't going to
be air push through here by any fans
anyways like I did or you can use the
abundant zap strap loops on the back of
the motherboard tray the CPU heatsink
mounting cutout is very large and well
placed and the power supply mounts
sideways as you probably guessed from
the side panel vent I mentioned earlier
it also has a little metal bracket that
goes in front of it this might seem
unnecessary if you're building your own
PC but I would recommend installing it
if you plan on shipping your computer
but all of that said cooling is a big
deal for this case and it shows it's
compatible with up to 8
120 millimeter or 740 millimeter fans a
240 or 280 Milt op radiator a 240 or 280
mm bottom radiator and a 240 280 or 360
mil radiator in the front that's a lot
of freaking cooling especially when none
of that will have to fight with anything
like hard drive Trey's SSD bays or even
cable management
unless you're insane and just shove all
the cables in the main compartment for
whatever reason which I think leads
pretty well into the conclusion the
Corsair air 740 looks rather striking in
a cool way
I had a surprising number of people in
the office comment on it while I was
working on my notes for this review it
supports a fairly insane amount of
cooling and it's possibly one of the
most easy to build in cases I have ever
personally handled with ample amounts of
room and tooless access to drives etc
but is there too much room I mean look
at this thing next to me it's large in
every possible dimension it's ginormous
and if you consider how much of the
space behind the motherboard tray is
actually used it feels like you're
making a trade-off for that ease of use
so if you want a wicked looking case and
an easy building experience this may be
for you but those of you confined to
small living spaces maybe steer clear

Amazon or our store where you can buy
shirts more both who knows
it's a mystery link or links not sure
which one watch this video which is our
old air 540 video because you get to see
like Linus just say random things about
a case that he's never seen before
because he used to do unboxings with no
prepper he would just open the box and
then just talk as he rotated the object
around welcome to the start of Linus
