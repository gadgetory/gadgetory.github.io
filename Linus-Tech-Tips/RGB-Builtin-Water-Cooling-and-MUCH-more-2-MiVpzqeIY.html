the CES 2017 for the past few years
getting excited about a motherboard has
actually been a little difficult other
than like adding on our jeebies and a
few extra fan headers there hasn't been
a ton that they've even been able to do
because the chip manufacturers AMD and
Intel have taken a lot of the work onto
themselves and moved everything on to
the chip but I think they might have
figured it out with the Maximus 9
extreme this is an amazing freaking
board and not just because everything
lights up in whatever freaking color you
want there's a ton of other cool things
as well it comes with water cooling
built onto it right away but not just
water cooling water cooling with a built
in flow rate meter in the block and leak
detection these little rings around the
main G and a quarter inch slots will
actually detect if there's a leak and
will send information to your computer
to a user configurable shutdown timer
cool but that's not it that's not it at
all below that there's an extra little
panel if you remove the screws on that
there's an MDOT two slot that is cooled
by this little metal piece right here so
it's all built in no need to point fans
at your motherboard and across on the
other side something that I really like
I hate USB 3.0 headers that just too
many pins the little tiny things they
suck this right here is a USB 3.1 gen2
header which will be available on newer
cases coming up I think in Wynne and
Lian Li are currently kind of pushing
cases and tons of other people will in
the future it looks like a much better
more robust header I'm excited to use it
there's a bunch of other cool stuff as
well like dual BIOS is 12 fan headers
most of which are in the bottom right
hand corner or upper right hand corner
with one on the left hand side just
gives you of a back case fan and one
kind of in the middle up there bunch of
right angle stuff as well a 4-pin molex
on the bottom so you can throw more
power into the graphics cards a
right-angle 24 pin which is pretty sleek
right angle SATA cables although those
are fairly standard these days and then
one of the now I'm going to call it old
school although it's basically current
generation USB 3.0 header as well two of
those fan headers can be used to power
your pumps and they are labeled
accordingly and then just to the right
of that there's another header for
another flow rate meter just in case you
want to have a second loop in your
system for audio in the
bottom left-hand corner you'll see the
supreme FX s 1222 so that you have nice
onboard audio and then that brings us to
the i/o where no stone was left unturned
either at the top of a BIOS update
button a CMOS Clear button two antennas
for Wi-Fi a DisplayPort and HDMI
connection to USB 3.1 gen2 ports one in
type A and one in type C and then six
USB 3.1 gen2 net optical audio and a new
audio Bay now this is what we're used to
if you guys can see this right here this
is a standard audio Bay where everything
is just colored on the outside this is
the new bay notice how everything is
just gold I could be a little
frustrating to figure out what you need
to plug in but no they're all RGB lit
just like everything else on the
motherboard so in its default
configuration everything's kind of what
you'd expect it the one that used to be
green is green the one that used to be
blue is blue but you could change it if
you wanted to I think the Maximus 9
extreme kind of redefines what it means
to have an extremely high-end
motherboard and it's in the name so it
kind of makes sense but let me know what
you guys think in the comments down
below
