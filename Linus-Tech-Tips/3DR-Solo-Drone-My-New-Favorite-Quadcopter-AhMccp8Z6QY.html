market is developing we might have to
get used to hearing this but the 3d
robotics solo is the most advanced
flying machine we've yet piloted and is
going to make a lot of enthusiasts happy
just like the personal rig update 2015
project that I'll be kicking off this
weekend drop a like if you're interested
in seeing what kind of harebrained
scheme I come up with this time Corsair
delivers real mech or nothing with their
new strafe mechanical keyboard featuring
genuine German made Cherry MX key
switches click on this spot right here
to learn more we're gonna start with the
tour of the remote actually much like
the parrot bebop 3dr has opted for a
controller with an on-board computer
that acts as a communications hub so
your phone or seven-inch class
tablet fits in the spring-loaded mount
at the top and connects via Wi-Fi to the
solo link Wi-Fi network that is
broadcasted by this then using a pair of
antennas on the back of the unit it
maintains a shockingly crisp and
responsive video feed from the GoPro
camera that is mounted to the front of
the drone now of course physics is a
thing and out at 250 feet or so the
adaptive quality of the feed does go
down and you will see some hitching but
at that kind of range you probably
shouldn't be piloting first-person view
through the trees speeder bike style
anyway and it's definitely good enough
to give you some idea of what the camera
is seeing up there also back at the back
of the remote is the micro HDMI output
that can be hooked up to a head mounted
display or anything with an HDMI input
and pan and tilt controls for the GoPro
compatible three axis gimbal mount
that's coming very soon and boy are we
ever excited about that on the left is a
plug for the included controller charger
then we get to the business end here the
sticks do the usual things left for yaw
and elevation and right for a forward
backward and strafing but then there's
some cool stuff here to the a and B
buttons can be bound through the app to
various flight modes so we'll cover
those late
returned home has a dedicated button
that puts the drone at about 40 feet
then slowly and very stately brings it
back to where it took off
pause solo X is a virtually break power
is pretty self-explanatory and fly
handles automatic takeoff and landing
the app which I just mentioned is pretty
straightforward and other than some
flakiness with the live video feed that
we think we've resolved by connecting to
Wi-Fi first then launching the app on
the phone seems to be stable on both iOS
and Android right out of the gate
unusual and impressive it allows you to
see your GPS location overlaid on a map
update the firmware record the videos
transmitted from the solo to your phone
directly to your camera roll adjust
in-flight responsiveness anywhere from
you know the drone barely moves when you
push the sticks to oh it's a little fast
for me and I'm going to turn it back
down to medium and even allows you to
enable advanced flight modes that don't
lean on the drones onboard GPS to keep
it where it's supposed to be but one of
the things I actually like most about
the both the app and the display in the
middle of the controller is that you can
find all the information you need like
controller and solo battery life
altitude airspeed distance between the
two units oh and on top of that it talks
to you when something bad happens like
if the battery is low absolutely
fantastic
alright so I haven't actually left much
time to talk about the solo itself have
I let's go quick then inside the really
cool box that could easily act as a
carry case you'll find the solo six
propellers so you'll have one extra of
each of the two types in case you crash
the massive 5200 milliamp hour battery
that keeps this puppy in flight for over
20 minutes a charger for that and the
GoPro mount but to find the coolest
things about the solo we have to look a
little closer than the shiny and matte
black top that I personally think looks
great not that that matters when it's
supposed to be flying above you anyway
and check out the bottom each propeller
arm has colored LEDs for orientation
assistance the landing gear is strong
but flexible so it shouldn't snap very
easily and there's not one but two
mounts here for extra stuff one gimbal
mount and
one accessory mount which 3dr is
encouraging developers to create
products for some of the stuff in the
queue is an LED flashlight and a
parachute for safely flying over people
sick all right so let's talk about
flight now then she handles as well as
3dr says no flyaways no unexpected
behavior the most stable descents I've
yet encountered even within what I would
describe as very noticeable but not
unpleasant gusts of wind and in spite of
the weight of this puppy just generally
very good behavior in the air as long as
you don't do anything dumb like forget
that you're set to the slowest possible
turning speed or set it to orbit you
when there's an obstacle in the default
20 meter radius it managed to be
effortless enough that Brandon having
never flown an RC airborne vehicle
before was able to watch 20 minutes of
3d ARS flight academy videos which I
recommend by the way and operated out of
the box while also not being boring for
someone like me who while I'm anything
but an expert has logged dozens of hours
in the air with quads and planes but
let's talk about pre-programmed flight
patterns one of the big selling points
of the solo along with the f-word which
I never recommend counting on so here's
what it does today a couple of the modes
selfie and cable cam could be performed
by a good drone operator in his or her
sleep both are activated in the air
selfie allows both an A and B point to
be set with the default at 50 meters so
you activate it with the button and the
drone flies away backwards away from you
then swoops back in towards you have a
predetermined speed for a really
dramatic looking shot and cable cam
pretty much just goes from one point to
another as though the drone was
operating on a cable you can control yah
and if you had one you'd be able to
control the gimbal but that's it two of
the other modes would be difficult to
impossible to do well for any but the
most skilled drone operators orbit and
follow both of these are also activated
in flight and rely on the target being
orbited or followed to carry the
controller and the mobile device that's
connected to it
orbit worked as expected
goes around you and keeps the camera
pointed at you follow seems to have a
three to four second delay when the
target changes direction and some
shakiness that would definitely benefit
from stabilization but it's a very good
start and on that stabilization note I
guess we can make our way into the
conclusion for this video where I will
have to address the glaring omission in
the rest of everything that I've said
quality of the in-flight recorded video
well thanks to the close partnership
with GoPro even without a gimbal our
Hero 3 plus Black Edition delivered IMO
better than that horrible bundled camera
on the three fixed DQ x3 in spite of the
fact that that one had a gimbal but that
doesn't mean it's great or even really
usable for anything other than real-time
monitoring or hey that's some cool
footage thanks to its weight and
advanced onboard electronics Solo is
shockingly stable in flight but it's
still in flight and the $400 gimbal is
in my mind a required accessory if you
want to get the most out of flight modes
like follow in orbit or if you're using
the solo for anything I've been going
out and flying for fun so expect to see
a follow-up video once that's available
where we discuss its performance and
whether 3dr has managed to deliver on
the f-word promise through the
development of first and third party
accessories and even perhaps through the
availability of things like mounts for
black magics new super tiny camera which
it's rumoured might be light enough to
be pulled by this puppy as it stands now
the solo is impressive in almost every
way
flight time performance build quality
GoPro compatibility and the fact that
you can get a live feed from the GoPro
instead of some goofy camera but of
course that comes at a cost and with the
gimbal this puppy's going to set you
back well over a thousand US dollars but
what won't cost a thousand US dollars is
