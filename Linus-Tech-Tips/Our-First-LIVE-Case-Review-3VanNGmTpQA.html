long time now and I've pretty much
generally done them in the same way the
entire time but I'm going to mix it up
finally with the first case being the
master case maker 5t from well
Coolermaster the way that i'm going to
do it is i'm going to take it out of the
box we're going to look at all the
features or do the the case walk through
from the front i/o to the inside and all
that kind of fun stuff like we normally
do and then i'm going to build a
computer into it but i'm going to do all
of this live on set so you guys can come
along with me throughout the creation
process and get my first-hand experience
building with the case come along with
me
tunnel bears the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet
try tunnel bear for free at the link
below to start us off right in the top
we have another box
it's a box that's within a box that is
encased around a case don't worry about
it
this is Coolermaster on it it's made of
metal has a foam thing on the bottom
which is nice it won't scratch up your
table and inside there are accessories
with their own little individual
compartments which is awesome but we
will go more into that later when we're
actually building the computer then we
have a user manual but who needs that
and that's what I'm here for anyways and
then there is a microfiber cloth this is
included because there's a tempered
glass side panel on here and you're
probably going to want to clean it off
because those things collect
fingerprints and everything else like
crazy
the foam that comes with it I can tell
you right now is pretty awesome look how
thick that is huge and like if you press
into it it doesn't absolutely break but
you can see where I punched it pretty
good the case itself has a big handle on
it which I'm obviously going to have to
have some fun with let me just get it
out of here oh there's even more foam on
the back of the case it seems slightly
unnecessary but I'm not going to
complain about more packing foam because
there's a high percentage chance that
your case will come intact this is one
of very few cases that I've seen lately
that actually comes with the tempered
glass on the actual case and it looks
pretty damn good but we'll come back to
that later first we're going to start
with the front IO so I'm going to do a
nice little peel for you guys
everyone seems to love that one gripe
I'm going to give them while the peel is
nice they put a whole bunch of gloss
right where people are gonna have to put
their hands so this area is going to
look terrible after a little bit of use
there's 4 USB 3 ports a headphone and
microphone jack a reset button and a
power button both of which seem nice and
satisfying and clicky 2 press and then
you have a fan speed and fan lighting
mode control as there's a hub which will
be able to check out later on but I
don't know which one is which because
they left them unlabeled and you can
actually see if I just do this how like
grody this front panel gets after just a
little bit of touching it which is a
little bit unfortunate the front of the
case actually pulls forward if you just
do that because you can put optical
drives in the front or fan hub controls
so yeah if you eject your drive I'm
assuming the drive might push this open
but if you have an optical drive in this
year I would be pretty surprised anyways
so moving up to the top of the case we
actually have a pretty surprising amount
of features on the back here we have a
trapezoid like plastic panel which can
be removed if you want more airflow or
kept on if you just want the more
consistent aesthetic at the front you've
got another area for your fans to
breathe and then right behind that under
the handle there's some angular slots
which look pretty cool and also feed a
little bit more air to those top fans
it's obviously not going to breathe as
much as if the entire top was open but
it should do pretty okay then because
it's a master case maker kind of deal
you can just pull this whole freaking
thing off to access the insides if you
want to remove the handle you can take
off these two screws and this screw and
then slide it backwards and off and then
if you want to be able to access where
you can put your all-in-one coolers or
just your top fans in general you remove
these four thumb screws and then take
this whole tray off which we will do
later on for when we install our a i/o
now of course there's a handle so I have
to test the handle it's been a little
while since I've had a case it has a
handle on it that I get to test and this
one has tempered glass on it so it's a
little heavy but here we go
oh my god it's really easy
one thing came off that's it and it was
just the trapezoid panel that we just
removed put that back and I think that's
a pass the left and right side panels
are the same and require these keys to
actually remove them they don't have the
like padded screws that a lot of the
other tempered glass side panel
implementations utilize so they just put
the key in here turn it to the right and
then try to remove the panel it all
comes off as one just like that nice and
easy and it works that way for both
sides the first thing you will probably
notice when looking inside of the case
is the striking red paint job which
should go well with the light bar
because they're saying if you light it
up the metallic flakes that are inside
will reflect and it'll look really cool
but right behind that light bar you have
two SSD mounts to the right of that you
have two rubber grommets which can
probably feed your PCI Express power to
your graphics cards above that you have
more rubber grommets that can be used
for like your motherboard power your 24
pin USB 3.0 all that kind of fun stuff
above that you have little cutouts for
like fan power cables and your CPU power
and then a motherboard cut out for easy
cpu bracket mounting and down at the
bottom again you have a couple more
cutouts for things like your HD audio
and maybe your front panel headers just
to the right of that we have the free
for modular system that's the series of
holes where you can install a whole
bunch of different stuff like reservoirs
or in this case a GPU holder bracket
thing which you can pivot and raise and
lower if you use the little thumb screws
that are on there to support your
graphics card so you don't have the ever
ugly looking graphics card sag at the
end of the card looks gross isn't good
for it just this so you can just put
that on here which is nice and cool to
the right of that and up a little bit
you have the optical drive tray and a
place that you can put like fan control
hubs and stuff like that although the
case has one on the back so I don't know
why you'd bother put one there I don't
expect this to get used all that much
but oh well
down from there you have a big hole that
was cut out that's how you can fit tall
radiators if you take out the hard drive
tray that is in the bottom you can fit
tall radiators and he
therefore 120-millimeter by 2 or 140
millimeter by 2 moving around to behind
the motherboard tray we can see the fan
and LED controller hub which is the
board's one two three four five six
different fans which are all three pins
although I'm sure you could somehow
kajigger a four pin onto there and four
different LED strips but these have to
be freeform LED strips these do not work
with the twenty twenty plugs that you'll
see on a lot of like mass-market LED
strips down here there's the backside of
the hard drive cage that we saw in the
front and the other side of our rubber
grommets along with a whole bunch of
like velcro styled cable management
loops three of them in a row and a bunch
of notches in various places that
they're often already using for cable
management like going up to your 8 pin
slot and with that I think it's time to
build so let's get to it
first thing I'm gonna do is actually
remove the graphics card support thing
because it's sort of in the way me
installing stuff but luckily that's
rather easy to do install my IO plate
motherboard and get that guy in there
right away no I'm not I need some of
these so Coolermaster gives you a huge
thing it is all labeled so used for side
panel use for top fan used for
motherboard tray power supply and fan
cage cheese for motherboard tray etc etc
etc is a huge baggy thing of them series
of them but they don't reseal or
anything so once you open this you're
done but that being said you still have
these little slots in there tray that
they gave you that are unused so you
could just keep using the parts tray and
put the stuff that you take out of it in
there so it's not too bad before we move
on actually says something wrong earlier
it's not just a 2 by 120 or 2 by 140
millimeter radiator and fan setup you
can do in the front if you take out the
optical drive tray by removing 4 thumb
screws and just sliding it out you can
access this area and this little
accessory that I found in the box the
accessories box up into the top bit and
then you can fit up to a 360 millimeter
radiator and fan setup as well if you
want to expand your
even further and with that we will
continue the build okay finally time to
put the motherboard actually in the case
okay the motherboard is installed I'm
gonna take a look at this light bar that
they have in here so they have it taped
in when it first showed up but it
actually has a magnet on the back you
can see the the black backing isn't just
black backing there's some there's a
bulge over here and I'm assuming there's
another magnet over here as well and you
can just place it onto the case and it
sticks there even without the tape it's
pretty cool and means that you can move
it around kind of however you want if
you want it to go for whatever reason on
an angle back here you could do that or
if you wanted to run it all the way
along the side you can do that as well
which actually might look better will
see where I decided to end up leaving it
but I'm gonna put it there for now that
could look pretty sweet next up we're
gonna install the power supply I really
like it when case manufacturers include
these external power supply bracket
thingies I just find it makes it a lot
easier to install things especially
because I like installing all the cables
for my power supply first so it looks
something like this I know everything
that's going to be plugged in and I get
it all set up and then all I need to do
is screw this bracket on to my power
supply dangled my cables through and put
my power supply and I don't have to
worry about like jamming it into the
side or any of that junk and it just
seems to work better for me and there we
go the installation of the actual power
supply is done now I just need to stand
the case back up and wrote all the
cables one nice thing about their SSD
trays is that you can put the SSD inside
of it and have the nice flat black top
and have it all be stealthy and stuff or
you can show off put the SSD on top of
it screw the SSD in through the inside
and display it that way which is pretty
cool so I'm gonna do that of course I'm
leaving the cooler to last so it's just
inevitably gonna be a huge catastrophic
issue which is gonna make me take apart
my entire build in order to install the
cooler we're just calling it right now
it's gonna happen it's my fault
I take all responsibility right now
I have to say I absolutely love it when
you can just install the radiator
outside of the case into a bracket and
then just drop that bracket inside of
the case I hate trying to work with the
full case just to install the damn
radiator it gets so frustrating and it's
just so much easier to do it this way
I'm going to try to turn it on while
it's on its side just make sure it works
what god what was that
it's the port smoking is there something
for you Oh
what the something's dead like if you
smell this it's bad oh you smell that I
haven't seen anything specific yet yeah
there's something then you can smell it
right now
that's supposed to happen
Oh powers
it's definitely in here somewhere okay
so um something fried and it smells
really bad right now which is why I'm
wearing this I'm not even sure if like
breathing in those fumes is a good idea
so I thought I'd put a mask on I'm going
to try to take everything out and figure
out what exactly fried but I seriously
doubt it's the cases fault and the build
log went pretty okay so so far doing
good master case maker five tea but I do
need to get to the bottom of what just
fried so that was fun it's never
actually fun to like lose computer
hardware but it was interesting to say
the very least I thought now that it is
rebuilt with a new motherboard and a new
power supply new RAM and new CPU just
making sure that nothing's gonna smoke
up that I would turn it on again on
camera because who knows what might
happen so here we go where's the power
button voila
it works nothing made crazy ticking
noises or started smoking or anything
like that you've got the cool light bar
on the bottom everything's on and I
didn't waste an entire another computer
worth of components comments about the
master case maker 5 t if you liked the
mask case maker 5 it's pretty freakin
similar there's now a fan and light hub
controller on the back as a handle on
the top and there's tempered glass side
panels everything you know and love from
the previous one is still there and
because of that there wasn't a huge
amount to comment on throughout the
build it's a wonderful case if you want
tempered glass that's awesome if you
want to handle not enough computer cases
these days come with handles this one
has a very sturdy handle I'm not even
worried about it now and honestly with
everything in this thing it's rather
heavy anyways overall review it's good
it's not surprising tempered glass has
been around for a little while handles
have existed before the light bar is
kind of cool but
kind of think I need more of it we have
teamed up with a razor to bring you guys
another giveaway one lucky winner will
get a Death Adder elite mouse and/or not
a keyboard a Kraken v2 and a cloth a
cloth and five other lucky winners will
get a Kraken pro v2 headset some of the
features of the Kraken pro v2 include
larger drivers a lightweight frame a
headband design for better weight
distribution and less clamping force ear
cushions that are larger softer and have
better sound isolation and you can
personalize it to fit due to it being
interchangeable it's got a fully
retractable unidirectional microphone
and most importantly from the time that
I've spent with it it is just plain way
better than their last headset so
there's a definite thumbs up for that
