tips livestream featuring the one the
only you me what is your name
let's look yeah yeah that this guy on
Twitter her actually looks like I could
be pointing anywhere I have a really
really weird birth certificate really
slick PC yeah so we've got a lot of
great topics for you guys tonight and
knock on wood there should be no
technical difficulties because we I
think have finally pretty much sorted
out our entire streaming setup including
our microphone we're actually finally
using our high-end camera can we can we
knock on like every piece of wood in
existence before the stream just just
crashes randomly because of something
out of our control
yeah actually you know last week last
week was a little bit rough because the
issues were actually caused by my
internet just deciding that it hated its
life and that it didn't want to help us
stream to you guys anymore so that was
super disappointing are you going to be
running on battery throughout the entire
livestream there yep oh that's not gonna
work
turn the mic down turn the mic down no
nobody doing this is the first time
anyone's ever said that yeah but
apparently we're clipping oh yeah we
finally figured everything out on the
live streams perfect and remember murmur
nope hello how's the audio guys how's
everything working is it good is it bad
everyone's saying no I don't know what
no means mic is good makes good it's
fine that's good well apparently the
volume was really good we're getting
conflicting answers here don't turn it
down to quiet too quiet turn it back up
keep tuned it like a look can you use
hearing a little bit back up not really
it was like it's almost back to where it
was okay okay well let any rate we don't
have to talk that loud so uh uh uh here
we go so what should we start with today
we have our hands on a galaxy s4 which
is pretty exciting for those of you who
don't know the galaxy s4 is Apple's
first foray into the Android Marketplace
so previously Apple was really on sort
of a locked-down
a hardware software marriage type of
configuration where they really didn't
believe in using open source software
like Android but they have done a
complete reversal Steve Jobs has risen
from the dead and come back to lead the
company into the bright horizon that is
Android I was just seeing if you were
paying attention because I'm pretty sure
it took you a while to figure out what I
was so what we're actually going to be
talking about is first impressions of
the s4 so I I don't think have you spent
much time with the hands-on it's none
okay so for those of you who haven't
seen it already there's a video on the
Linus tech tips channel where I was at
my briefing on the s4 with Samsung where
they showed me the ins and outs of the
device and there were some things that I
thought were somewhat trivial that ended
up being a far bigger deal once I had it
explained to me correctly and it's not
just like explained to me correctly like
hey Linus where's your back pocket I got
a hundred dollar bill here I'm just
gonna slip that in there and give you a
little pet no it wasn't like that it was
hey Linus you know that feature where
the screen works even if you don't quite
touch it well what about what about this
mr. Canadian over there what about when
you're wearing gloves and I'm like oh
right because when I first heard about
that feature where you can control the
touch screen without actually quite
touching it I was like oh boy who needs
that right but then all of a sudden like
oh that's right so now you can actually
interface with the device even when you
don't have your your hands well I mean
you'll still need hands that would
rather be a good thing mind you you were
telling me about that gamer who plays
without hands yeah
Oh should we transition to that now
don't worry we'll make it back to ask
for its on my it's on my list I'm gonna
grab the s4 we're gonna jump into the
thing no no no we'll talk about that
later
so just gonna talk about him I think his
name is look no hands although it could
be some other variation of that you just
hit your head on the light that's kind
of funny but no one saw it but he his
hands are messed up so what he does is
he presses the controller against his
face to control the game and he plays
called the duty and stuff and it's
actually pretty awesome he's got videos
on YouTube and stuff check it out it's
actually really cool and he's actually
legit by the low swings pretty good too
crazy I mean he's not like good like 10
to 1 kill to death ratio but he's good
like pointy to one he's good to the
point where you wouldn't like if you
didn't see his name you'd have no idea
that he didn't have hands which is kind
of insane so I got my hands speaking of
hands I got my hands on one of those
intel beanies they call them here in
Canada we call them tooks
show your face mask ring but the the way
it fits is a little funny it almost
looks like cuz if you fold it up the you
don't really see you don't really see
the graphic and then if you don't fold
it up then it actually ends up covering
your whole face so the crazy Russian
suggested to me that this is probably
the best way to wear it how do I look
it's fantastic it looks like a really
really crappy version of ghosts sweet
and doop the skulls off this goes off
where turn it to the to the right tip a
right your breather and I write your
right
how's that that's a little bit better
but now the milk is a little bit off so
do the bottom a little bit there you go
we good okay will you give me ten bucks
if I do the rest of the livestream like
this if you do the entire rest of the
last room like this ten bucks let's see
I would say yes but that would get
really old not only that but I can't
read and I can't see like I actually
can't see through this thing so anyway
guys if you didn't if you didn't hear
about it before until it was giving away
beanies if you got a 35 70 K or a 3770k
or whatever else but one of the twitch
chat members would just like to inform
you that it's an improved
on your look oh thank you thank you for
that um anyway so back to the s4 so okay
right so I was more impressed than I was
expecting to be now one of the things
that pictures really didn't convey well
was the build of the device give me rest
to you for a second you have it on you
right so the s3 feels like honestly
weight-wise they're probably very
similar they haven't gone the the iPhone
5 route where Apple basically went yep
we're gonna make our phone weigh almost
nothing and it's gonna feel like
space-age in your hand because you're
like whoa the the s4 weighs about the
same as the s3 just sort of holding them
but what it it feels a little bit more
solid I think part of it for me anyway
is the fact that the sides are more
square I know you guys aren't gonna be
able to see this perfectly by any
stretch of the imagination but the s3 is
very curved whereas the s4 has more of a
flat side and what I find is that for me
personally I'm able to I'm able to hold
it more naturally without it without it
slipping past me this is one of the
things I like about the HTC One where it
has kind of a a bit of an edge on it so
you're less likely to drop it for me
it's more natural to hold a device that
has flat sides so the ergonomic changes
although it's not really apparent in
pictures do make a difference and it
just feels a little bit more more solid
than than what we've seen in the past
from from Samsung and I'm including my
experience with the s1 and the s2 right
and the s3 another cool thing is of
course you've got the swappable back
plates which is something the HTC One
can't do which gives you that microSD
expansion the removable battery as well
as the the option to change your
backplate so it's something like an HTC
One they're taking a very Apple like or
approach where every HTC one will look
the same except silver or black the
batteries really beast though one of the
main things that I like about removable
back plates is you can pretty much with
every single removable backplate you can
change your battery yes and that's
helpful in case your battery Bork's or
just sucks but they should see ones
battery just seems it seems to be just
kind of awesome
like what was that you played music for
homem yeah for like six hours that day
and then I had like 35 percent left at
the end of the day which is kind of like
on speakers which is sort of ridiculous
yeah like it was easy to find him
because I could just follow the music
okay so anyway it feels more solid also
they have removable backs that are going
to integrate wireless charging which
takes about three times longer than non
wireless charging but from a convenience
standpoint honestly if it wasn't so
expensive it's the kind of thing I'd
look at and go y'all buy like three of
them and then just leave like one on my
work desk one on my nightstand and one
in the car I don't know like some work
where you basically just put your phone
down don't think about it and then it's
charging which is very cool honestly
it's kind of criminal what they're doing
with the accessories as far as the front
covers goes there's one that has a
window which is neat because it uses
magnets to know that that's the front
cover you have on and when you look at
your phone you can check notifications
just through the window and because it's
an emo LED screen it doesn't have to
light up the whole thing so it just
lights up that one little bit and
conserves your battery but they want an
extra 20 bucks for the window version
and I'm like really twenty dollar
plastic window they're just like okay I
thought it was just a cutout I didn't
even realize there's a plastic well
there's a plastic window so it's like
the premium like cutout option but as
translate actually works yeah which I
was floored by I was expecting it to be
one of those ladies yep works
phenomenally well I did a couple test
runs I don't speak French particularly
well but I can read rudimentary French
pretty well like enough to know oh yeah
that's what it says we're a hundred
percent with a couple test phrases that
I did with it
the the new eye tracking scroll the page
thing is it actually work really well
you know what it's the kind of thing
where I kind of looked at everyone oh
yeah this works because what it does is
it locks on to your eyes and then you
tilt your head like this to scroll the
page so it's the kind of thing where it
takes probably about two and a half
seconds to lock on and then if you kind
of go like this your pages got going woo
until it until it disengages kind of
thing
like oh yeah it works but would I use it
mmm probably not yes so the other one
that was kind of like controlling it
without touching the screen where I
looked at it and went really does this
matter was the the motion gestures and I
didn't obviously think about it enough
but it has a motion sensor in the front
which means instead of relying entirely
on the front camera which would be a
huge battery hog you can gesture at the
camera say for example if you're in a
meeting you can turn on a gesture where
you put your hand over it you kind of
use the force and it comes up with a
little thing that tells you if you have
any missed calls or missed messages or
whatever else so being I mean I'll be ok
there's there's other gestures like you
can go like this to change the track and
you're actually no no this was a good
one I was about to make fun of this one
but this one's good so if you driving
you put it in a cradle on your dash and
you go like this to change the song to
the next track that's cool I'm just like
oh ok that's kind of nice yeah and
there's one to answer a call so it's
it's one of those things where I look at
my kids actually illegal to touch the
device at least formulas so now you
don't have to touch it now you don't
have to judge it kind of go in front of
it
it's like no officer I was just waving
at my phone I talk with my hands
yes hog and I was talking to myself so I
had to wave in front of my phone do you
remember that do you remember that
driver that we saw today there was this
woman yeah I don't know what she was
doing but she was driving your car and
it's like one hand I think on the wheel
like there are their arms like up like
this yeah and I'm like what so it kind
of looked like she was either sort of
conducting the music she was listening
to on the radio or really getting into
like an animated aggressive conversation
because she was kind of like yeah I'm
like a bluetooth thing or something why
are you doing your try you're operating
a motor vehicle ad like this ten and two
men make it happen okay okay so I
booze is cool because it gets me away
from having to use third-party apps for
I mean I think probably the big one that
everyone really really likes is the
quick access to all your on and off and
like the third-party apps are cool I'm
using power toggles on my HTC One right
now and you've got a bunch of options
and you can have up to eight icons
across the top but this one's kind of
neat because it doesn't only control all
of the standard options like Bluetooth
GPS Wi-Fi but also things like sbeam
smart stay smart scroll like the eye
scrolling and then smart stay is the one
where it it doesn't it doesn't dim the
display if you're still looking at it
all that kind of stuff so you can turn
all that on and off at will they also
include little tutorials which I thought
was cool from all of the Samsung
exclusive features did you I just saw
something sorry give me a sec guys hold
down oh you had a huge bar of options
what options Yeah right here I think
that's cool yeah so anyway so yeah
there's a huge all the options that you
could possibly there's a button on the
top right and you can drop down all the
options so with with my s3 and a whole
bunch of other phones currently you have
to get another app if you want to do
stuff like that yeah that's cool their
whole Knox thing bring your device to
work is fully supported on this one I
believe there was something that was
asked for exclusive all my notes from
the meeting are upstairs but guys expect
me to do some videos on the s4 over the
next little bit I'm going to an asus
event next week we've got some really
exciting projects we're working on for
tech quickie right now that are taking
up a lot of our time oh man the one for
the if you guys are following on Twitter
you probably saw pictures of like this
Frankenstein funk ms3 Mouse I think it's
on the camera yeah you want to run and
grab it because it's like actually kind
of Awesome so so we were working on a
cool thing where the funk ns3 Mouse is
we're doing like the making of the funk
ms3 and it's gonna be kind of obviously
a parody because no one at Linus Media
Group is actually on the funk staff and
responsible for making this Mouse but
it's the first time we've ever actually
brought in outside actors to come in
and play roles in our videos and it's
going to be super professionally done
so that's odd that's really really
exciting so she's falling apart a little
bit it doesn't zoom that much
okay do you want to take them on a
little tour through that make sure you
speak up all right so I added a bunch of
key caps here just random things just
random things that I thought might be
entirely not useful on a mouse so so I
pried these off the keyboard and just
kind of stuck them to it you can see
it's literally just two sided tape
that's why I said I just had to do some
minor repairs and some of them had
completely fallen off and some were kind
of way off by a little bit
oh that fell off completely I stuck a
few random capacitors on top of this on
the right side of the click and then
this had a little circuit board that had
a cable running back to the mouse wheel
which is kind of zombified on the back
as well as another cable running along
here and then - and I shoved just a
whole bunch more keys on this side so
there's more thumb keys here more thumb
keys here and then this one at the
bottom is actually stock and we had it
another key right here so there's
actually a ton of zombification on this
I wish this right here was still there
because that was actually really cool
there's a little circuit board that ran
a cable into the back here that looks
quite cool I'm not sure where that wait
but we were just using double-sided tape
for everything so it kind of fell off
yeah there's our is our custom Linus
tech tips edition funk now so take from
that what you will is there anything
else we can even say about that project
other than the video should be awesome
yeah the video will be awesome I was
pretty amused that I had a couple people
on Twitter that seemed to think that the
mouse was real yeah and we're actually
giving their feedback on it as a product
like ah you know I don't know if I'd use
that at all man I totally buy that no no
that's not an actual product it was just
it was just a joke I told you you made
it too
relooking yeah because I told him to
make it stupid and he actually put like
a bunch of stuff that was actually
looked like it could possibly be useful
like it's like really but it looks good
I know it looks good enough that people
thought that it was an actual product so
that should be that should be all you
need to know we're gonna move the
livestream yeah yeah
so the Friday the Friday night timeslot
this will be the last one we are moving
the live stream to our Monday afternoons
probably at around 4 o'clock so the
rationale for this is that it'll be
it'll be nighttime in Europe it will be
kind of like evening in Eastern North
America and it will be I believe what
morning you know Australia and that is
where most of our viewers come from I
mean look I'm so Kay for all of those of
you who are not in those areas I am
incredibly sorry but the numbers are the
numbers and we do see the numbers and so
we have to go with a timeslot that a
works best for the majority of the
viewers and B works a little better for
us because honestly at the end of the
week it's pretty tough to do these
Friday night late-night live streams and
I'm sure he's getting diced the look on
his face he's getting destroyed in the
twitch chat right now I'm sorry guys
there's nothing we can do about it to be
perfectly honest I mean it's my wife's
going back to work
she's been on maternity leave with the
baby so I can't do them on Fridays
anymore actually like period cannot and
evenings don't really work anymore so
yeah I'm sorry guys there's a lot of
people have said it too it's jack I know
I know and I totally understand but I
mean I always said this timeslot was
temporary and that it was going to be
moved from like the very first or second
one and it lasted a long time but we
will have to move it but we will still
be uploading the archives to YouTube
speaking of YouTube we are now activated
as a twitch
YouTube network partner
so it finally went through and that's
done so apparently that's actually like
because before sorry just completely
jumping away from what you were just
talking about
well actually of timing in Australia's
like not so good on Monday I guess that
would be Tuesday morning right when
people go to school and work because
right now it makes it Saturday morning
for them right anyways it's not like we
really have a choice
I mean yeah we actually don't have a
choice at the front if we could do it on
a Friday that would have been better but
the problem is that you know slicks love
life has really started to take off and
all the ladies that watch our show have
been lining up to get a date with him so
if you want his plenty of fish profile
now people are gonna go on a wild man
hunt for some plenty of yeah and they're
totally gonna find it I'm sorry dude I
don't have one he says you're really bad
at winking huh that was terrible you're
really bad at winking we can't all be
talented at everything
Oh oh man I have other talents that make
up for it
you wouldn't understand I'll tell you
about it when you're older um so Nvidia
is gonna be giving away Metro last light
with DJ 660 and up the arms race of free
video games with graphics cards is just
getting pretty heated and isn't it about
time yeah I mean how long was it that we
were getting like John woos stranglehold
and like some like racing game that no
one cares about I'm like come on you
guys where are the triple-a titles it
was more back then it was more like what
game isn't gonna sell so we don't have
to worry about these people not actually
buying it anyways we can give it to them
for free and it won't reduce our sales
and it won't actually matter because no
one will actually care and I'm tired of
that mentality this is great rewarding
people for buying the hardware by giving
them something to actually play with
that said I mean Nvidia's usual mo is
sort of one game bundle
every quarter or so and as much as Metro
last light is going to be a huge title
that's going to be a really big deal I
don't I don't really see it as that much
of a response to AM DS never settle
strategy it's still a little bit more
aggressive than some things I've done in
the past
sawsan he was kind of huge yep Batman
Arkham Asylum Borderlands 2 they've
actually been on not a bad run they've
been ramping up of triple-a titles yep
but then ambe's like it was like nine
times eh we'll give you three triple-a
titles don't worry about it and then
they're like oh yeah you bought some
stuff before don't worry about blood
dragon that's cool so I mean AMD has
just been crushing it when it's come to
free games
speaking of AMD our 7990 should be in
transit in theory so hopefully we're
gonna have some videos for you guys at
launch of 7990 which should be part of
the current never settled which I think
includes is it BioShock Infinite right
now and something can't remember anymore
flat tub but anyway there you go so
Metro last light is going and that's
cool so I'm gonna go adjust that camera
again because it sort of is funny you're
kind of bare and I'm kind of here and
then there's like lots of space over
here so I want to introduce scoot find
one of your cool topics that you are
supposedly contributed to how do I even
I don't have control of this of course
it's this keywords so small tiny baby
hands that's an inside joke people won't
understand for a while um judge voet
Verret I'm not sure how I pronounced
this judge something held themselves in
contempt and paid $25 for his
infractions so basically what happened
was he had a new smartphone and I
started shouting out voice commands
while he was holding court and instead
of being like oh ah doesn't matter I'm
the judge doesn't matter I can like I
can screw other people over for that but
nope it's fine
he held himself in contempt and charged
himself 25 bucks that's awesome well
that shouldn't be
normally and that should actually just
kind of be what happens all the time you
can you can correct yourself it's fine
I'm leaning over it doesn't always kind
of happen that way
people don't always kind of hold
themselves at fault if they actually do
something wrong there's a good chance I
wouldn't even think of it if I was if I
was that guy like I I'd just be like oh
crap my phone
Oh oops bloop yeah put it away but nope
held himself in contempt paid up 25
bucks I think it's pretty cool it's
actually really cool I'm like the
Internet's in love with them he probably
gained it a huge amount of respect
that's worth way more than $25 now more
than 25 bucks I mean yeah and you like
you contrast this with the millions and
millions of dollars that have made their
way to somewhere to get sistah pushed
through and you just kind of looking at
it going like you know you gotta I mean
it seems like there's so few people in
power who actually try to play by their
own rules that you just have to kind of
whenever one person does it it's like oh
yeah it doesn't happen it's like an
oddity which it it shouldn't be but but
it just kind of is it just kind of is so
that's both awesome and depressing today
all right what you got what else you got
oh yeah we're half an hour in we've done
0 Twitter Q&amp;amp;A I'm sorry you guys should
we take Hey
this leads into the topic that you had
ok we will talk about packs in a bit
yeah
there's a parent you know what let's
talk about it now ok so much for Twitter
Q&amp;amp;A so pax prime sells out fast was it
20 minutes the PAX Prime four day before
day tickets sold out in about I don't
know I don't think anyone actually knows
the actual time because of just how is
there grush that got the tweet from from
PAX Prime went out 23 minutes later but
there's no way that they tweeted that
out anywhere near the actual
so it was probably like 5-10 minutes
I'm after announcement that four days
sold out the final ticket was sold just
under six hours after announcement but
those like I think it was an hour after
announcement all that was left was
Monday only badges and they moved this
year to four days so it's like the last
day where some people have to like go
back to work and stuff right oh it's
like yeah that one's obviously not gonna
sell out as fast as the other stuff so
it's kind of ridiculous
um we know nothing about media badges we
know nothing about media badges I
haven't seen anything go up about media
badges I have a badge cool so slick
we'll be doing our entire Lynas Media
Group average of PAX Prime
single-handedly this will be my ninth
year I will expect you to hold the
camera in front of yourself like this
and be like the FS I think my duck lips
would really work that way if you shaved
it might help
it's like furry duck lips is even worse
than regular duck duck lips
come on let's see give us your best come
on oh you got to be a support for the
left I can't I can't do it
2,200 people tuned in to watch YouTube
where people's do not want to see free
look free duck you know what twitch chat
let us know let's see let's see let us
know if you'd like to see slicks free
double do not Ducks die do it do it do
it do it do it do it do it do it do it
do it slick please do it do it yes duck
let's do it do it come on let's go here
we go no I saw one no that's all I saw
wasn't good enough that man speaks for
the entirety of humanity right now could
be a lady that that that person speaks
for if it's a lady her viewership should
count more because we have less of them
anyway so PAX Prime sold out and we have
no idea what's going on as far as
whether we'll be able to be there or not
so there you go we were we were really
expecting to at least have some
information about media passes even PAX
East this year there was they talked
about it a lot more I might have missed
something I've been looking for it quite
a bit
I know PAX East it was fairly
transparent I haven't seen anything yet
about PAX Prime if you have seen
something please measure its message me
on the forum so we can figure that out
sure yeah let us know because I totally
might have missed something okay here we
go
apparently northernlion LP and Linus
tech will be streaming at the same time
on Mondays I'm sorry to hear that that's
bad
we might have to look into this last
ream time yeah more I mean we haven't
completely decided it's just that looks
like the time that will actually work
for us we can't do late Friday night
anymore yeah that is not actually a boss
that's done this so so next Friday there
won't be a live stream at all next week
there won't be a live stream at all and
the following week we will kick off our
new live stream time at whatever time it
is we'll try to figure something out
right now though it's looking like
Monday Robert says first time watching a
live stream live because of a nut job on
the loose yeah Momo I heard these I
thought he's in custody yeah I last I
heard he was on a boat and they were
chasing him so there's no way he got
that far oh yeah I saw a headline that
said one dead one in custody but oh I
could be wrong I mean I think there's
been a lot of conflicting reports so
hopefully you guys won't you guys want
sort of twitch toes as they go yeah okay
there you go so apparently they got him
and good oh he was hiding in the boat
okay so they weren't chasing his boat
they just found his boat yeah that's
good being a boat but don't move the
boat it's very smart I mean that's these
are the kinds of people who blow up
innocent people because they're
obviously brilliant glad they caught
them at any rate you know go internet
and all of the you know data analysis
that went on I don't know if it ever had
led to anything but read it had a huge
thing going on on pretty massive had
more like a few who's kind of cool uh
Chris go ham asks should I build a
gaming rig now or wait till III well
there won't be anything new at e3 so
make of that what you will what mind you
mind you has balls gonna be launching
around that time saying someone's
already mean for it
oh maybe he doesn't mean for
announcements maybe he means new games I
mean there's lots of new games now lots
of games to play right now so if you're
waiting for new games wait till November
yeah but don't wait till November to buy
a PC but don't leave me five months
honestly I'm just there won't be new
graphics cards between now and the end
of the year and all likelihood unless
it's late in q4 if you've got something
good I would wait till has well if
you're dying I would just get something
else get something now from what we've
seen has wells not gonna be some kind of
you know Conroe thing where it's like we
go from like Dark Ages computing power
to way more I mean if you I mean
honestly it's one of those things where
you can look kind of look at it
logically and go okay you look at
Intel's die diagram of it and go alright
well the actual CPU die area didn't
increase but it's got a like a really
big like graphics core now so if you're
planning to use the onboard graphics on
has well then wait for as well if you're
not then it would still be a little bit
better but it's probably not worth the
wait better than playing on a console
yeah speaking of consoles
except for Super Nintendo how's that
first yeah except for Super Nintendo
which we still have to do that is my
ultimate segue of the night into the
next gen Xbox I don't know much about it
but I know you need some add-on for this
retro actively playing game so there's
that oh oh fire it up there and we're
gonna do our new thing oh I'll fire it I
supposed to do speaking of fired you're
fired
for what for not firing it up on a segue
role that's a really five inch one okay
that's like way was fine say going into
fire me you have no grounds to fire me
for that sake we're all though come on
that was awesome terrible it was awesome
oh this is the wrong one that's not the
one I want I want the
yes I want the VR zone rumor okay so go
go go okay so VR zone is claiming that
the new Xbox 720 will be requiring you
to buy a mini add-on to play older games
now with the original Xbox 360 they gave
you backwards compatibility with Xbox
games but my understanding is a lot of
the time it just didn't frickin work so
there's that most of the really really
triple-a mainstream titles did work but
with a couple notable exceptions
honestly I'm gonna play devil's advocate
here and I'm gonna say I like this
approach what do you think I don't know
I don't really care
dedicate okay okay imagine that you
cared imagine that you actually were
gonna spend 250 bucks
yeah it's hundred fifty bucks 150 bucks
so it's basically a lot of money that's
kind of brutal okay it should be able to
play backwards parallel linkage that
shouldn't be what do you mean by should
though this is an x86 architecture it's
completely different from the Xbox 360
okay that actually does kind of makes
it's not like oh I'm upgrading from
Windows Vista basically so basically it
would increase the bomb cost by so much
yes that it would be nice to have it
cheaper for everyone and then if you do
actually want to play back with federal
stuff you can add that you do actually
want to play old games and you don't
actually already have an Xbox 360 which
is kind of funky if you won't play old
games you've probably already got a nice
Westar six I mean yes I understand the
convenience factor of not wanting to
press a button on your receiver to
switch the HDMI input but for my
projected trading value from trading in
your old xbox that's true that's true
you don't get trade-in value mind you
it's cheap enough at a hundred and fifty
bucks to me it looks like they're not
taking a bunch of margin I suspect
what's actually inside it if this rumor
turns out to be true is basically just
an Xbox 360 because it couldn't cost
much more than 150 bucks to basically
build an Xbox 360 now one thing don't
scream anymore I don't think
attenuations working Oh everyone was
like oh God might use sorry about that
so I don't think we're
sigh xbox360 something something
something well I think how much how much
resale value do you think you could get
for trading in xbox360 I have no idea
cuz if you could get like a hundred 100
bucks if it's a hundred bucks just trade
it in and buy the thing right so it's
one of those things where I look at it
again you know what it's not a bad
solution because if you're giving them
so what it'll do is they'll make it so
you don't have to okay ugh rumored
allegedly it'll make it so that you
don't have to have two separate HDMI
connections out so it's kind of like a
pass-through which will lead us to our
next thing so you can play your older
games and you can not have two boxes and
you can unload your old xbox360 and
because what I suspect they're doing is
they're basically just putting a small
Xbox 360 in it the compatibility should
be better than a clergy solution like
what Sony implemented with the ps3
originally right is this okay
I might not be ready with this Xbox 720
always-on right that's rumored to be not
necessarily true it's actually in this
same article on the Arizona but I mean
everything's very much up in the air
right now so the latest rumor will
require separate add-on may cost a few
gold coins however there's something
something something yet the rumor is
that it will not require an always-on
internet connection to play games
locally but we'll see and more
importantly Microsoft probably won't be
blocking the playing of used games on
the new console which we will see about
I have no idea how true any of that is
if that's not true if it is always on so
we're taking some kind of leaps and
bounds here which might not ever happen
if the add-on thing inherited the always
on yes
then that would be terrible that would
be brutal I'd want my old Xbox 360 but
exactly but this is very possibly know
anything worth talking about so whatever
so speaking of pass through the verge
had an interesting article about
Microsoft's plans for the
next-generation Xbox taking over your TV
is sort of there they're the sensational
half of their otherwise not that
sensational headline because interact
with your cable box is probably more
like what it actually sounds like
they're planning to do so
similarly to Google TV your cable box
would go HDMI out into your xbox which
would then pass through to your TV now
it's going to depend on Microsoft having
relationships with the content providers
to even be allowed to circumvent
whatever HDCP whatever else is going on
with the HDMI signal but the plan is to
inject a layer on top that would be
something like it could be marketplace
it could be more advanced to guide and
listings for TV shows it could be
additional content Netflix whatever else
it'll inject on top of what you're
already getting with your set-top box I
mean I suspect a lot of it will only
work in the u.s. particularly at launch
but yeah I mean could something like
this make the Xbox part of your living
room even though you have no use for a
console from a games perspective I don't
watch TV yeah what do you do play video
games and I program but I don't have any
time because I work so much right okay
fair enough the other thing that
Microsoft's looking at is how to make
the Kinect make the living room
experience more engaging so things like
being able to track multiple people at a
time being able to track my movements so
if one person looks away movie paused
which is the kind of thing where I
locate old on will Don could be like
settings though who knows how advanced
the next generation Kinect is so maybe
the next-gen Kinect is so advanced I can
go only positive I walk away yeah whoa
that would seriously be think is like
your sister is sitting on the couch and
goes looks at her phone and my lady's
like well I don't want my movie to pause
and my immersion to be destroyed and my
I don't watch movies i watch I said I
don't watch TV watch movies so much
trolling so the immersion level being
reduced and everything it just destroys
the whole space pausing a movie sucks
yeah you're causing movies sucks
well except when you're the one who has
to pee then you should have gone
beforehand
sometimes you drink a lot of beverages
here water today over a span of about an
hour and a half and then in between like
every shot
oh please like Oh a scotch you're
exaggerating don't pay a lot there was
two shots in between there
all right let's thank you I guess if you
if you add the tape yeah shots because
we don't count takes you only count of
shots
moving on to some more Twitter Q&amp;amp;A I
know there will not be a live stream on
this coming Monday great question and
it's too close to this one I don't think
it makes sense it'll have been like
three days and it'll be no weekend what
do we possibly expect to have happened
why will it not be on Saturday or Sunday
why is the stream down I am so sick of
Windows Live Movie Maker like cutting
this thing together it takes so long
what the actual hell is going on here
it's better go hello apparently back
hello so hold on let me just check the
xsplit recordings let's see if it if it
split it apart 233 Meg's apparently it
didn't split apart so there you go I
have no idea what happened there that's
someone telling you is transmitted yeah
I'm sure it is someone else that I'm
gonna be blocking on my phone after hand
roids awesome it has a lock feature so
all I had to do to to get rid of any of
the people who were calling or texting
my phone let's just click block and then
I actually don't hear from them anymore
so we were worried that we'd have to
change his number because he got yeah
trolls but I don't worry I actually it
was just a few people that were
obnoxious and they're all blocked and so
I think that who knows they might still
be trying to call but I don't even know
so yeah there you go um question here
why will it not be on Saturday Sunday
because we do have lives and he has a
baby guys like like sacrificing my time
is one thing you're not actually at this
point I don't even care about
sacrificing his time I don't care about
his time at all you're sacrificing his
baby's time man
so yeah I'm not a fan of babies some
people might know that
but as a dad you still need to spend
time with your baby so this won't work I
actually work Monday to Friday and I
actually work a lot more than 40 hours a
week outside of the live stream so I'm
actually not gonna be doing it on a
Saturday or Sunday so I mean thank you
for the suggestion but that is actually
not gonna happen when do we get to see
the new offices we're not gonna be
moving for a couple months I think it's
like 3 to 4 M and Southeast Asia
sorry one thing that we can do I haven't
pitched this Alliance at all so this
could be interesting is we can grab all
the time slots that are a possibility
throw them in a poll on the forum sure
this won't happen now oh god of course
you're going bad it's ok I'll just shut
them all off after then block them
it's not gonna happen now I'm not going
to do it now so don't rush to the forum
now don't bring it down yet we'll save
that for Bill blogs but sometime this
weekend maybe after this dream or
something I'll jump on or I'll jump on
will make a poll in the forum news
section or general sure you'll see it
because I'm sure it tons of people will
post in it and will post all the time
slots that are even possible for us to
do and then let people vote sure someone
asks about South America aren't we
important you guys are in the same time
zone as us what do you want
and everyone's important we just like
honestly baby like I said before ah if
you're gonna use the s4 how about the
Android 30-day trial I'm gonna finish
out the HTC One 30-day trial
the s4 demo unit I got has its own sim
in it so I can play around with it
without interfering with the 30-day
trial some cars are coming up with
integrated wireless charging put the
phone on a certain place on the dash net
charge that's very cool that is really
cool and that'll probably be one of
those sticky pad slots - very very very
maybe you know that thing diesel keeps
talking about every once in a while
where it can project images onto your
windshield yeah for like GPS maybe
they'll have the wireless charging and
sticky pad right where that is
that would be so be so awesome that
would like actually be the sweetest
thing ever I don't know a lot about this
if you want to know more about it
tweet diesel the intern he'll talk to
you about it yeah he knows he knows all
the things I'm pretty sure he follows
every news show I swear his room must
have more monitors than mine
and mine has a lot and they must just
like multiple reddit pages like every
single news show that's actually casting
right now every reddit page Oh Oh check
this out did it when you weren't looking
we have okay so someone someone helped
me capture slicks duck face oh yeah you
actually actually didn't hold on a
second hold on a second I'm not even
actually a duck hold on I got to share
this with I got to share this with
everyone just a second just a second
I don't I'm not gonna look hi twitch
chat add screen region let's just add
this whole screen so I also it's lagging
so there's pretty much no point you're
doing this because it's lagging so much
there we go so there you guys have it
that is slick scratch boom you just
dropped it just drop what it's dreaming
how could it possibly go down oh no
they're almost laughing at me there we
go you look fantastic this is this is
why we like you cuz you're awesome
alright so let's go back for those of
you who weren't with us earlier
I challenge to slick to to give us his
best dunk base so stream will keep on
legging for 20 seconds or even go
offline for a minute or two in what
situation we I don't know seriously guys
get a camera slider your advert video we
have a slider
we have slider shots in the Seagate
wireless plus video we have slider shots
in the upcoming video we have a slider
hello from Toronto it's late here how
high do motherboard manufacturers
prioritize the ITX segment of the market
quite hard what thank you yeah since
when there won't be anything at lunch
yeah but they still support it yeah they
still scrum well I mean Asus has a
high-end ITX yard which is like these
gigabytes ITX board doesn't overclock
still it idx a sousou's one is boss hey
SUSE this one is like being and there's
a few other that are really nice yeah
for a weird subcategory like that that's
pretty supportive what is it no no it
doesn't matter it's all good it's just
that it was that well no my head's cut
off that's okay because these will
explain to me that it's okay to cut off
someone's head as long as you don't cut
off their chin oh yeah
zombie is there something I'm gonna go
back to leaning okay what were we
talking about well yeah we were doing
Twitter Q&amp;amp;A I hate you guys like the g7
10 plus yes a slice and one thing that
pretty much no one knows is it comes
with black o rings under the key caps
yeah very cool which is like an
aftermarket mod type thing they're not
gonna be
see that little o-rings under every key
cap that make it quieter by the way
don't just pull your key cuts off do it
with a proper key yeah yeah what are you
doing man what what I just wanted to
give a shout out to your farms that
helped me pick upgrades to improve my
stream great community awesome thanks
miles
and hopefully you continue to go there
well we transition to better Forbes
cause currently they suck yeah
that's not no no it's okay I hope it's
coming soon it's hopefully coming soon
ps4 is only gonna be able to play ps3
stuff only through the cloud not on the
console itself so if you have not very
good internet which was I'm sure what
this viewer meant to say there you go
interesting
speaking of ps4 and streaming games over
the internet let's talk about that Sony
thing oh ok where is this let's pull up
the thing right right right
I believe Japan is rolling out two
gigabit internet which will bring fiber
directly to your house and then each
house will need its own something box
that I don't know the name of that will
convert the fiber - oh and you box that
will convert the fiber to proper
Ethernet so this was a news story
submitted on the Linus tech tips forum
by and vrb 747 and the the most obvious
question that I've heard from people is
what could anyone possibly need two
gigabit internet for most computers
these days come with a 1 gigabit
connection in the back - which I would
reply well guys lots of households have
more than one computer now so your links
are horrible you're so bad
anyways you have to weigh with your
whole face
I can't otherwise oh yeah i legit can't
oh yeah I've like a condition it's
called not able to wink itis
it's the only way I can sorry Mike that
was probably about so so anyway so VRB
747 thank you for contributing that to
the new section of the Linus tech tips
forum guys do check out the new section
it's gotten to the point where I think
over the last month or so traffic in
that section has about ten xed which is
which is outstanding because it's
turning the Linus tech tips form into a
great place to go to check out the
latest news by the way it goes in the
tech news and reviews section not the
forum news
we should probably clarify that at some
point I'm probably gonna lock off forum
news clarify it like but make it so that
people can't create new topics because
realistically you're just supposed to be
commenting on topics that are already
there right but that will probably
change to forum forum news and
announcements or something like that so
that it's more clear maybe okay Wilfredo
but that section is not actually for
news from the community I'm not done
talking about two gigabit internet so
basically Sony is going to be bringing
fiber right into your house for the low
cost of what are they charging fifty
bucks a month fifty or sixty or
something fifty or sixty bucks which I
saw a few people in the twitch chat go
like oh but it's that expensive man we
paid that much for like no and cool
internet like 15 megabit down what is it
512 K up or 1 Meg up it's it's might be
512 K up I think for like the $60 plan
punch ah yeah so like that's incredible
depends where you live maybe you have a
better situation let's continue our
conversation from last week would you
cut off a toe for two gigabit internet
for which two people - yes middle toe do
you even need that one don't think so
would you cut off a middle toe like
which okay hold on I'm gonna make it
gruesome though would you like
consciously without numbing cut off your
middle toe what if it was free for the
rest of your life
but then that won't be that high
performance but you'll be high
performance for an awful long time
two gigabit internet on fiber is going
to be low latency and high performance
for a very long time
when it's scaled would it scale let's
say gales it scales but say it scales
you would cut off your middle toes use
their baby would look at it is there a
bandwidth cap bandwidth cap let's say no
maybe I like like like you have to use
like bolt cutters really yeah why are
you making this song it has to be
gruesome what's not like just hold on oh
no just just but okay there's there's a
there's trained medical staff next to
you ready to go would they put me out
right after I do it I'm pretty sure you
put someone under if their toe is
missing I don't think so really yeah why
we probably just locally because you
might go into shock look last day okay
whatever they're gonna do whatever they
need to do I'm not a medical
professional I don't know not at all so
don't mess about bolt cutters on the toe
would you do it for two gig Internet now
in its scale see I would like to say yes
right now but honestly I think a lot of
people say yes outside of situations and
if you actually sad them down in like
here are the view I will get the bolt
cutters you'd probably have me in a barn
in like a metal chair in like the most
gruesome creepy situation making this
sound really bad
you'd probably why would I have you in a
barn in a metal chair okay why did you
have to take it there why didn't you
take it there no no I mean like I meant
like what's his name I said there's
medical profession what he likes to play
a game what's what's is would you like
to play a game that's his tagline
there's multiple movies Chucky no horror
Eason maybe mine I don't know saw twitch
chat knows switch head knows every the
chat does know everything I saw saw
you've heard of sorry I've heard I've
never seen like to play a game yeah it's
all creepy and all messed up and I feel
like you would have that weird
creepiness messed up factor but you'd
get two gigabit internet out of it but I
think by the time I sat down I might I
might chicken out but I would like to
say yes now I think there's a one-time
fee to actually get it into your house
that's probably pretty rude which is
probably pretty brutal but I mean
sort of that sort of life I think you
have to subsidize stuff like this a
little bit I think we're an awful long
way away from Canada reaching this level
of Internet connectivity but the reason
I did segue into this is that this level
of internet 2 gigabit per second low
latency fiber it would be capable of
streaming games it's coming but the
place that has always had the fastest
internet has it and nowhere else has it
and it's gonna take so long other places
to transition but you look at look at
companies like Nintendo and Sony these
Japanese companies how many cares do
they give exactly that only Japan can
use a lot of the technology they build
yeah none yeah zero so that means there
will be customers for invidious grid
technology which is their cloud-based
gaming so remote gaming service so there
will be customers there will be grids
being deployed it will be a real thing
very soon I am interested to see how
many massive outages there are because
it doesn't matter at all what back-end
you have every single big launch in so
long as a failure launches because no
service can support it okay well would
it be any different than already it is
then it's gonna be worse you think so ah
apparently there's are people coming
home so a fairly large group of randoms
just pulled up um but it's it's way more
serve power because they have to do all
the graphics rendering on their end
right that's not that won't affect
Network doesn't matter the server
backbone will not be able to do it all
right well no we're even close
like the graphics power to power all
that it's gonna be not how few people
are gonna have two gigabit connections
though are those people gonna overpass I
think there will be a slow ramp
don't have time Japan they're gonna have
time to build like 40 supercomputers on
top of each other
there's gonna be nuts I think I think
we're far from it like very far from it
because of graphics power you and I can
agree to disagree the network backbone
is definitely there you're right but
graphics power for all those people it's
gonna be nuts because people are gonna
be like okay I'm playing it like five
frames per second this is retard
pay more get more frames Oh
oh wow
free to play when you connect it's super
slow so you suck or when you connect it
plays that like 480p or like 320p right
I mean you emigrate through a premium
account to make you look fit or like an
uber premium account to get more
graphics horsepower and then maybe maybe
it's you're actually accessing the
server so you pay like monthly fees
based on how good your want your
connection to be and you get to play all
your games at that or it's coming though
don't do tons of stuff that's it will
scale it will be just like the most
bizarre has not reading thing I really
helped them manage the graphics power it
would help them manage the graphics
power can have Network yep of course
both of them
I think Ajay qual 260 P 480p exactly and
for some games it wouldn't matter
we tennis who cares yeah yeah okay so
here's a big thing Fox
oh I forgot to put down the link for
this one okay well crap I forget where I
saw this link but Foxconn has settled
with Microsoft over Android licensing
fees so this is fascinating because the
rumor has it that the because
Microsoft's already settled with a
couple guys and the rumor has it that
Microsoft is extracting as much as 10
dollars or more per Android device in
licensed software licensing fees how
many cares does Microsoft give about
Windows Phone 8 at that point honestly
I'm sure they care they care but like oh
yeah you guys are making folks good job
good job cuz we're up to what was the
new number one billion total Android
devices shipped to date was it was it
today I thought they said they were
going to ship a billion this year okay
it's why I don't think it's gonna be a
billion this year that's a lot I don't
remember what it was anyway some things
would go something to do with a billion
and something to do with about over half
of Android devices are apparently being
tacked on with Microsoft licensing fees
according to a Microsoft rep so there's
that so if they sell another billion
within a much shorter period of time
look
the way sales are ramping Microsoft will
be collecting exactly that many billions
of dollars just for sitting on their
butts watching Android outsell
everything else I've had I've had people
say 1 billion by the end of the year and
I've had people say 1 billion to this
date and I've had more than one person
say the 1.5 million activations a date
which is nuts Wow
because that means what Microsoft's
gained 50 million times a day for not
making things
well no less than that because they were
saying more than half so let's say seven
and a half million dollars a day still
for not actually making anything that's
no R&amp;amp;D but they haven't already done
years ago right
no tooling of the device do they care if
they don't sell surface because they
Microsoft was actually this tied in to
one of our other topics from last week
which was the report that the PC was
dead and iPad was killing it and PC
sales were down 14% and then a report
came out this week but Microsoft's
profits were up something like 14
percent or 17 percent or something like
that I can't remember I don't know we
don't have it and I don't think I've
ever made it to our stream outline but
I'm kind of looking at it going yeah
I don't think they actually mind if not
too many copies of Windows 8 so so just
like Microsoft will survive that's
something we've learned they'll be fine
they're figuring I mean they're figuring
out content distribution with things
like the Xbox music app store they're
figuring out gaming in a way that I
think Sony kind of forgot so they're
figuring out that they're figuring out
finally I mean they tried with media
center PC that was 2002 XP media center
no no the PC will be an integral part of
the home to the living room environment
here we are over 10 years later and it
looks like the next-gen Xbox might
actually finally get there but they've
been determined that's they're gonna do
it so they're finally getting to that
point
I'm not worried for Microsoft media
center PC was pretty cool but like how
many people
you know that had one right so one right
yourself to do my parents and my then
girlfriend's parents so it's because I
am right that's pretty much the same
experience it whatever bad places that I
put it in that's the only places I knew
it exists cases that I put it in and
then went and helped them fix it over
and over again yeah oh I gotta restarted
again
oh it's windows we should do what times
we should do the rest of our community
news item see ya community news items
here we go so for those of you who
haven't seen this this is friggin
awesome why don't you why don't you here
let you do this one Josie from the forum
posted odd the the X bit labs article
about the 7990 Malta being of available
through an eBay sale it is prohibited to
sell engineering sample items on eBay
and just in general it's not really okay
so here I'll let you take over I'm just
gonna go find out who that is that's
probably before all of our stuff goes
missing and we can't make videos anymore
anyways so this guy puts up a seventy
nine ninety Malta on eBay and expects it
to actually work or he's trolling I'm
not really sure either he's he's an
idiot or he thought it would be funny I
think that's really all that is left of
that but yeah it got up to how much let
me check this really quick guy on the
floor I mentioned it ninety six thousand
one hundred dollars from IP changing or
charger that's that's insane I brought
that up with - earlier and he mentioned
that it was probably someone trolling
they weren't actually gonna pay that
much I don't know I think that might
have been legitimate which is terrible
because even if you make a review of it
or anything you're not gonna make back
anywhere close to that amount of money
like nowhere even remotely close to that
amount of money not even not even on the
same scale like you couldn't way those
against each other
and the funny thing is unless you're a
reviewer unless you have some kind of a
hookup you can't get drivers for it yeah
you actually won't be able to run it
don't we embargo lifts I would hope that
that guy would at least give you a
driver with things I'm gonna be it ships
with the USB Drive and I have one nope
no usually they don't and you've seen
how they distribute no I know through
yeah like an FTP your $96,000 must have
been a joke I think you could give the
guy frickin a flash drive for his
$96,000 speaking of engineering samples
we are officially has welled up we can't
put them on anything yet yeah we don't
have a motherboard you have speaking of
not having the drivers to run the
hardware we don't have the motherboard
yeah look it's a champ and the top is
kind of silvery colored lower power you
know how many times I've done this where
I've just been like holding the new CPU
knowing that actually I can't do
anything with it it's like every
generation the chip always arrives first
the asus thing that i'm going to should
hopefully have some details on their
side but so far I haven't heard anything
solid from any motherboard guys I think
MSI's got boards lined up for us
gigabyte said they're gonna do their
best to have boards lined up for us so
we have all the haswell's
actually that's one of the four that
arrived in the mail for us people are
saying open it but like these ones are
so boring
they're white box you guys I mean what
do you want here hold this for a sec
sorry I know you switched it yeah don't
worry we're on this okay here we go as
well this particular one is a 46 70 K
there you go comes with oh my goodness a
sort dining stock cooler that looks
exactly like thermal compound amazing
pre-applied revolutionary cool on your
face Oh ma'am I got it on my face okay
that's all right okay so there's that
okay what's next it's revolutionary I
know changes everything this changes
absolutely everything again changes the
changes again the changes are changing
on a logarithmic the fashion the
innovation is amazing
chip beautiful pads on the probationary
I think this is all low time it doesn't
change how many times have we seen this
that's been done respect for a while oh
that's probably a pretty solid indicator
it's down oh this is frustrating
last time it just revived itself so we
can maybe the the epicness of has well
we're saying Intel was like nope yeah
the epicness apparently we're back so
the epicness of has well just destroyed
the live stream because some employ it
in tones like smash laying the hammer
down there's like control all of the
internet but yeah we've seen this time
and time again it never actually changes
we're talking a couple percent here and
there this chip has been finished for
months essentially let me put it that
way like the kinds of tweaks that
they're making in the months leading up
to a launch remember Intel sets a launch
date like an actual day like months in
advance how could they know that it's
gonna be ready that day because Intel is
not like some you know cheesy software
company with two letters in their name
that starts with CNN's and a where
they're just like release date if it's
not ready release it anyway Intel does
QA like that a long time ago it's just
over and maybe if they send us some
pizza with our next game but anyway I
mean it's been done for months which
basically means that the chip that
they're testing is pretty much done and
it also means that whatever board which
has pretty much no logic left on it now
that the chip itself is integrating the
PCI Express controller the memory
controller the vrm the
Regulation modules which was part of our
topic last week that we skimmed over a
little bit that I'm gonna launch into
here there's not a whole lot that the
motherboard actually contributes to the
performance anymore besides just
providing a conduit for traces to go to
like the memory slots so speaking of has
well there was an AMA on reddit a number
of months back where an Intel engineer
said it would be an overclockers delight
and I think a lot of people assumed that
that would mean that unlike Ivy Bridge
because Sandy Bridge was a great
overclocker Ivy Bridge had better
performance per per megahertz then Sandy
Bridge did but it didn't overclock as
high so they ended up being for all
intents and purposes for overclockers
equally performing platforms I think a
lot of people assumed that that meant
Haswell was going to overclock like a
bat out of hell again but what he might
have actually meant is that due to the
integrated vrm you're gonna be able to
buy a cheapo motherboard and you're
going to be able to get the same kind of
overclocking performance as an expensive
motherboard which by the way two
motherboards running two chips at the
same frequency I don't care what board
it is are going to be within margin of
error of each other in terms of
performance when it comes to
overclocking increasing the system
performance it only does it if you can
get more gigahertz a trend that we've
been seeing lately that you actually
picked out a while ago is that people
are building really really high-end
systems and I don't want to put a ton of
cards in them because they're just going
to graphics card oh it looks good I
don't want to touch more cards you leave
it how it is I don't know no I don't
want to touch it
um listen I always put in sound cards
and he's got a raid card great cards
with eight SSDs on it and I'm just like
yes my cable management isn't perfect
but you know what I actually have
Hardware in my machine like we enjoy
putting
Hardware in our machines so Wow
so anyways I'm wondering I wondered I
can't even talk to me that was
ridiculous I wonder with hassle if we're
gonna see a lot more card heavy machines
cheap motherboard throwing a custom NIC
throw an awesome sound card by it via
one $19.99 board buy a proper sound card
proper I don't know like what a like I
mean SSDs are at the point now where the
onboard controllers are not able to keep
up with multiple SSDs so if people want
to actually get the most performance
possible out of their storage system
they may need a third party RAID
controller
speaking of which for the longest time
people would ask me is there any benefit
to read zeroing SSDs and having run
everything from a hard drive to a cached
solution to an SSD to a better SSD to a
better SSD to an 8 SSD array in my
personal machine over the years I would
always tell them actually no what really
doesn't make any difference I was wrong
because I mean ok yes it makes a
difference in benchmarks not much is
clear but I've had people ask me
day-to-day do you notice a difference
and I didn't notice when I upgraded to
my 8 SSD raid 0 array and it didn't
bother me that much when my personal rig
was down for a long time and I wasn't
using it but now that I'm back on it I'm
like oh yeah it actually makes a
difference I watched some some program
openings that were ridiculous like he
runs a fairly decent SSD you've got an
octane 256 right which is not the best
SSD in the world but it's good it's a
SATA 3 SSD it's not a bad Drive but it's
just like it's it's the responsiveness I
didn't realize what was missing until it
was taken away and then I was giving it
back and I'm like oh ok right this this
is good speaking of which my personal
rig is a hundred percent up and running
now the only thing I'm missing is
cosmetic I'm missing the glass panel for
the side window and then I'm also
missing little grommets to cover things
with I can turn on right now that's not
my personal ring the RAM is oh no no I
put g.skill RAM in it oh yeah and when
you finally bring the server back from
NCIX I wanna be able to deck it out it's
doing good things right now yeah I know
ok I just need that RAM
yeah for my rig all 64 gigs of it was 48
in there yeah but I have 16 ok in my in
my rig right now yeah that looks like
what
we're both we talking about oh yeah we
wanted to do the rest of the news items
so here's our here's our next rumor so
this one looks pretty interesting we're
gonna hopefully we actually what's going
on oh there it is all funky we actually
know nothing about this yeah but good
bytes contributed this news topic Wow
eight hundred-pound advice contributes a
lot to the news section thank you
goodbye
thank you good bites you are the man or
lady person guy dude dude is kind of
both no one says dudette yeah no three
people also say guys yeah hey guys
reference to entire groups of people
good bites is one of good guys one of
several good guys regardless of gender
and I mean you know what hey genders not
so much just like an on/off switch
anymore there's that sort of that whole
gender spectrum discussion so good bites
good individual good human or even
multiple people I mean schizophrenia is
a thing good good well unit organism or
you're a great organism okay let's
settle on that from now on okay
technically right I think so because he
could be multiple organisms if he has a
parasite inside him yeah anyway what is
politically correct can you talk about
this anyway so in videos releasing some
new GPUs allegedly allegedly we actually
have no idea the first I heard of this
was actually good bytes post so so
according to the post it won't be
Maxwell next-generation but rather a
refresh of the Kepler series which makes
sense because like everyone else
Nvidia seems to follow that Intel
tick-tock strategy where it's processed
shrink architecture change process
shrink architecture change so we've got
Kepler now may be a process shrink
reduction of heat and power consumption
maybe some more overclocking Headroom
some bud fixes and performance
improvements which all makes sense for
process shrink all in all I'd expected
gtx 780
to be 10 to 15% better than a 680 just
guessing but maybe 20% better maybe it
over clocks a little better maybe as
lower power consumption all this makes
sense however go ahead the main thing
I'm hoping for is no plastic extensions
yeah I don't want full pieces no ego
extensions on them you know what's funny
is have you seen a reference 77 90
because we didn't have a reference 1
when you were doing your testing I have
knowledge it has a long PCB but like 2
inches of it are just blank
honestly it's still really bad I'd
rather a PCB than the most attention but
it's still like that you know so what
I'm hoping if this does turn out to be
Nvidia strategy is that someone launches
a completely new architecture because
AMD as far as I know has been talking
about the end of this year something
going on that's another rumor allegedly
we don't actually know for sure but if
they launched a completely new
architecture that could put Nvidia at a
bit of an advantage for the next few
months but then at a bit of a
disadvantage in the in the months
following that I mean especially if AMD
can launch something in time for here's
an article on it on PC / by the way
there's the fuds illa link so we can go
check that out
I mean Fred Zilla take it all with a
grain of salt it spuds illa yeah I
actually met Fouad for the first time at
CES 2013 really yeah I ran into him he's
a super soft-spoken I was surprised yeah
I was I was hanging out with Josh from
fractal oh cool and and fudo knows him
apparently they go way back so they were
talking sense food Oh didn't have no
idea who I was of course so like one of
those things do you even know who I am I
had - tech tips from YouTube you can't
give me a ticket on YouTube exactly
don't you know where internet-famous
means I walked through a forest once and
chugged hot sauce oh that was painful
that was by the way the red bottle was
hot sauce me Ashley did it was like not
you know it would have been smart to put
something else inside it I did not think
of that like legit did not think of that
so we've got two more very important
items coming up these are gonna be our
featured build logs of the week so slick
take it away Desert Storm Desert Storm
was the first we're not logged in so why
don't you talk about Desert Storm will I
logiss in Desert Storm is an awesome
tribute to just picking the right color
scheme parts and like envisioning your
build before you do it and then sleeve
your power supply properly and just
having something that looks so much more
than some of its parts without putting
like way too much into it so this is a
like great looking computer it looks
absolutely awesome hopefully Linus can
actually log in so I can stop stalling
stalling for time as I talk about how
the computer looks good there we go so
he picked like a Desert Storm II kind of
color scheme you know what I'm gonna
zoom out a little bit that actually
looks better as you do there we go so
everything kind of suits
it all looks good you can tell it was
find out beforehand nice a tough tough
series board selection so screws board
the right color vengeance Corsair
Vengeance memory looks good that's great
looking sleeping that he's got on there
where she fdpc X yep I wouldn't mind
seeing things a little bit tidier in
here but honestly mine's not much better
so I can and it's still pretty good
can't criticize team I noticed that too
actually but it's still it's not bad
it's not bad at all
at least it's sleeved but you can you
can get your groupings a little bit
tighter than that there's a great job on
this leaving look how even that is yeah
it's it's not quite as good on the power
supply but people won't see that really
yeah mines ghetto on the power supply
just cuz it doesn't really matter
yeah yeah so you can see it's a little
bit more choppy there but just as we
both said earlier doesn't matter what
he's got some really nice photos I
really like that one this one this one 3
Coolermaster v8 looks really cool cooler
master v8 I don't think gets enough
credit
No very cool looking it performs alright
it's not a bad do you think they really
build as well because it's kind of heavy
oh there's the money shot yeah so he so
he he must have planned it out he must
have envisioned it beforehand
he picked the right parts he sleeved his
power spine it just looks really good
yeah this is the kind of build that is
very doable for you know someone
building a new rig that I mean obviously
you need a bit of a budget to make over
here like that but it's not one of those
crazy like you have to own your own like
water cutter to do like sold your house
and bought a few machines and some tools
and some parts and built a computer so
it's which we're not saying is a problem
no no no of course that's yeah that's
why don't have it not at all except my
confusion I think this one is just
that's the psychedelic machine it's
called it's nuts i I'm gonna let it kind
of speak for itself once we get down
here a little bit so he's picking some
parts access PC displays okay yeah so
he's just installing lighting there and
this is car lighting that he just
adapted into molex plugs okay that's
doable it's just 12 volt yeah I know so
you're starting to see the kind of crazy
color scheme coming in okay so we got
red on the red green on this bit of
tubing right here lord only knows what
kind of coolant he's gonna put in here
or she all the fingerprints on the power
yeah
almost done oh it paints it black wood
paneling it's it's he's like you know he
brought into it's it's kind of easy to
work with like it looks sharp okay okay
panels not on yet red mod on the pump
red and black sleeving more green tube
in alright is that the the Aqua our
alpha cool it looks like it cause I see
the film in the middle
look at that coolant the reason why this
mainly got in here is his awesome custom
wood panels right and the fact that is
just absolutely nuts absolutely like
pants on head ludicrous look at this
he's intentionally left extra space at
the top of the res so you can see it for
us so the water can pour in which makes
it louder and more obnoxious but I don't
think louder and more obnoxious as a
problem it's probably going for that
it's probably going for loud and
obnoxious here it's it's awesome it's
looks like a cool build you don't see
stuff like this at all
the phobia UV LEDs are better they have
much higher density so if you're out
there oh we didn't even say who this who
contributed this build Oh Slayer 677 not
quite 66 not quite it's not actually
better than that one
he's just a slayer one more than that
but yeah if you want to swap those up
for the phobia ones they're quite
excellent I actually encountered tubing
that glows like this or a coolant that
glows this strongly once and it was it
was some weird brand I can't even
remember from like Germany or something
I still have a bottle of it upstairs it
glows like nothing I've ever seen before
been saving it for sort of a rainy day
so that's just absolutely wacky tabacky
I don't even like its nuts there's no
more but it's just I build this crazy
love it so love to see these kinds of
awesome builds guys don't forget to post
in the build log section of Linus tech
tips forum for a chance to be featured
on the live stream which gives you the
self-satisfaction once what's the new
forums up we are gonna be looked at I
haven't you don't even know how much
I've talked to you about this but once
the new forums up I'm doing this so
whatever man yeah well it's the new
forms up I'm gonna look into custom
badges and stuff so you can have them on
your profile whenever you post it'll
show on the side and stuff so you have a
little emblem or a badge or something
and we'll have like News contributor
news contributors bill blog guys just
like different awards that you can get
so there actually be something to show
for now
you get a brofist you get a brofist and
wind speed has a sticky at the top of
the bill dog section with everyone who's
been featured oh okay cool
and that post gets fairly frequented so
that's pretty cool yeah that's a great
way to show off the the hardware I mean
it's one thing to work really hard on
someone and then like your sister and
your like your friends are like okay
really
that's your computer it looks like disco
they're just like oh you don't
appreciate this they're like yeah no we
don't so it's it's great to have someone
who actually appreciates what you've
done look at it speaking from experience
okay why don't we I think our last news
item of the week is a bit of an ongoing
thing right now if you go to Diablo and
comm we're gonna link right here to the
Eurogamer article about a gamer who's
been banned from twitch dot TV so uh
slick you want to cover this one do you
even have the live stream no I'm trying
to deal with something else that's going
on right now so no I do not cal cover it
um okay so basically this gamer who's a
Diablo 3 gamer who's gone by the name of
zillion Opie has was pretending to be
paralyzed from the waist down he was
pretending that he was stuck in a
wheelchair and couldn't walk in order to
in addition to his game streaming which
presumably his streams were decent
otherwise I doubt anyone would have
really cared that much
it was often him and his girlfriend and
sometimes other people so it was kind of
a group of them yeah so they'd all go
together they were streaming presumably
bizarre right he asked for money
to get a wheelchair I asked for money to
travel to move in with his girlfriend
asked for just generally money there's
been an estimated 20,000 dollars donated
over the time that he's been running
this little scam just sort of asking
people for money because of sob story
boo-hoo-hoo I'm a wheelchair-bound gamer
I mean I I suspect there's a lot of
people who game who are in wheelchairs
them is there's people that are
legitimately disabled yes that are
trying very hard to make it and are
trying to stream and they enjoy it and
there's communities built around in a
camera the name and then there's this
butthole this is this just pretending
like look no hands that guy's amazing
right a guy that's blind who does Let's
Plays he's done a whole let's play of
ocarina of time it's amazing that's
incredible
there's tons of all these different
people like that is awesome and if you
donated a whole bunch of money to
someone who plays call duty without
hands because he doesn't have any or
someone who plays Zelda because he's
blind that's cool like you're cool
actually have a disability so they
actually are not able to do other things
necessarily as well as or as easily as
other people it's like yeah that's cool
but supporting you know this guy and I'm
not saying it's the fault of the people
supporting them don't take it the wrong
way but you know someone like this
asking for support is just the most
offensive kind of wrong like how must
that feel if you were one of the people
that were like you know what this guy's
cool I want to help him out because it
must be hard for him right now
and donated to him and then you figure
out that the guy is a scam so in a clip
of the incident the the player is shown
leaving a game in progress by standing
up and glancing at the camera he doesn't
appear to rise entirely straight but
seems to be walking unaided yes here's
the the miracle clip hopefully don't
like it oh no it's oh yeah sure
so he rolls in like you guys just saw
audios on so so he rolls in he's target
for a sec skips to the end takes off his
headset and whoa those legs look like
they work a little bit so his
girlfriend's trying to tell him in code
that he left the camera on and so the
excuses were he pushed off his chair and
he said he and wiped out which I really
don't think happens no I claimed the dog
knocked over his water bowl onto a bunch
of cables girlfriend later claimed that
he was going through physiotherapy but
it hasn't been working very well and
apparently you can even see I don't I
haven't been able to see it but and see
he puts points the camera down so that
he can get back into his chair without
anyone seeing him walk into his chair
which is brutal like it's just so the
Internet's not impressed with you sir
not impressed with you at all in happier
news if we jump away from this our
folding team is doing great in the chimp
competition if you haven't heard about
it check the postion of challenge chimp
challenge competition
jump on the forum check out the post are
members of our Foley team not everyone
but a few members of our folding team
has joined forces with overclockers
dot-com I believe sorry for the bad
information over parkas calm yes
so we've joined forces with them because
it was too late for us to sign up with
it for as a team and we're not actually
big enough yet but we are one of the
fastest growing teams
so we're thinking about this time next
year we should actually be big enough to
compete which is really crazy because
not that many teams it's very new yeah
and yeah it's our team's really new so
yeah go help them out the chip
competition like honestly you're just
pushing for a good cause like it's a fun
competition gotta help everyone on the
plane there are no losers yeah
so that's extending that guy in
wheelchair because I'm actually that
jerkface can walk hopefully we don't
help him yeah anyways yeah
but yeah check out the competition
Whaler one of the mods in our forum that
manages all this kind of stuff is
building a 4p folding system which is
just gonna be absolutely insane he's
gonna be making a post about it soon but
his folding setup is just monstrous for
p4 the record doesn't mean that it
facilitates urination it means that it
has four processors I think that's it
for our topics for the night though hmm
yeah I know so we're just gonna do a
little bit of Twitter oh you know what
actually we're gonna close off the
livestream here because we've noticed
that people aren't really watching it
for yeah we'll be back so we'll be back
for afterparty but we are no longer
going to be uploading the after party
segment to YouTube so to do that what
we're gonna have to do is cut the stream
for a second and it'll be right back
we'll be right back give us a moment
thanks for watching tonight everyone
who's tuning out now or who's well we
have to do an outro because when people
watch this on youtube there has to be
remember how many people complain that
night run we didn't say goodbye right
bye bye everyone watching on YouTube and
everyone that's live lets live on twitch
will actually film a subscribe favorite
share what else can you do is there
anything else you can do you can give us
money for a wheelchair that we
apparently don't need my legs oh please
don't do that don't watch any videos
that we've done recently my legs don't
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
