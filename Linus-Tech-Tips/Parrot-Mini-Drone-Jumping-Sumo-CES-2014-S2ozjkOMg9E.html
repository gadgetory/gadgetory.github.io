brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital we're here at the parrot
booth and they have got something a
little bit different on display we're
used to seeing flying vehicles from them
but this one is mostly on the ground
except when it flies through the air so
this is the jumping sumo it can do a
bunch of really interesting stuff but of
course it's right in the name the main
functionality is the fact that it jumps
it can either jump up to 80 centimeters
in the air or up to about a meter in its
long jump mode now in terms of
construction can I actually borrow one
of these for a minute I'm just going to
blindside everyone and steal all the
things from it so they're using have the
highly customized lightweight
construction because the idea was that
if you're going to be having something
jump 80 centimeters in the air and then
bounce back down all the time you're
going to have to have some extremely
special tires on it and aside from
having the power to move around and spin
around and actually it can it can walk
around in three different ways so it can
either go in kicker mode which you can
use this to grab things and knock things
or it can go into sort of like a Segway
mode or it can go into jumping mode you
are going to have to make sure that it
is both strong and lightweight it has AQ
VGA camera right there it connects to
your phone or your tablet via 5g Wi-Fi
so you should have pretty good range as
well as well not as much interference as
you'd have with 2.4 g and in terms of
the connectivity you can connect to
either an ipad or an iOS device or an
Android device now it does support both
live streaming the video as well as
recording the video and I'm pretty sure
there's something else I'm supposed to
say about it yeah runs for about 20
minutes on battery and we don't have a
price for it yet but we should expect
this to be released at some time in 2014
and now we're here with the ar.drone
well the mini drone I guess is not the
ar.drone because there's no augmented
reality this time around it still has
one can
in addition to its barometer
accelerometer and gyro but this is a
much smaller much more low power device
than the original AR Drone as you can
clearly see from the size it can fly
either with what is presumably a safety
device so these wheels on either side so
it's much more difficult to crash into
anything or in a more naked mode now I
can give you guys a pretty close look at
it here you can see the bottom there's a
camera but this camera won't necessarily
be enabled for video recording
functionality it's just for stability so
you can see they have a demo here with
the mini drone actually flying back and
forth in a pattern over some markers on
a board below me you're looking at about
eight minutes of battery life and unlike
the AR drone which required Wi-Fi and a
tablet to control this one does require
a tablet or a smartphone to control
either iOS or Android but it uses
Bluetooth 4.0 low power in order to
enable its small size low power
consumption and presumably low cost
although they're not talking about
pricing yet this has been our very first
video from CES 2014 guys huge thanks to
our sponsors NCIX your source for great
technology selection and service and
corsair as well as Western Digital</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
