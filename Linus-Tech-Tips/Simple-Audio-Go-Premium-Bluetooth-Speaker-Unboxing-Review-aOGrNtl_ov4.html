peripherals has the features you need to
win at a price you like click now to
learn more now when I covered the
ultimate ears boom I had said you know
what these Bluetooth battery powered
speakers probably not a lot of
innovation left this will probably be
the last one I look at in a while well
it turns out I was wrong this my friends
is the simple audio going quite frankly
I wasn't gonna check it out but someone
who I liked very much
and respect very much told me well ok
please check it out because it actually
is really good and I was like okay fine
I've heard this before
but fine so the go is priced in line
with the rest of the market at about a
hundred dollars physically it's about
the size I mean they like to say this
it's about the size of an iPhone 5 in
terms of the amount of space it takes up
on your desk but obviously it's a little
bit on the thicker side compared to an
iPhone but I guess they're right about
it being about that size it has a metal
grille on the front with a soft touch
finish on the back and has that awesome
grippy material that Razer has on the
back of their I believe it's the
Ouroboros wireless receiver but like you
put down and it just like doesn't move
it practically sticks to things it's
actually outstanding it has an on/off
switch on the back as well as a line in
and USB for charging or powering it and
using it all the time and on the top it
has a glossy series of buttons so
there's your pairing button as well as
taking calls button yes it has an
integrated speakerphone just like most
of these devices as well as volume up
and down now the claims of amazingly big
sound due to carefully crafted acoustics
should probably be taken with a grain of
salt with that said there are two full
range drivers to cover the mids and
highs and just like their more high-end
listen product there is a base
reinforcing passive pressure driver that
is ported at the bottom but should add a
little bit of thump to it and some
tightness to the base if that feature
works anything like its bigger brother
the listen that I'd expect it to work
quite well just make sure you've got a
position on a hard surface for maximum
effectiveness now from the amp sp1 and
the ultimate ears boom
I'm expecting some serious competition
in our listening impressions the go does
use a Class B amplifier and aims to
deliver a fairly flat frequency response
compared to the overpowered lows and
highs that we get from comparable
products so let's spend some time with
it and see what we think here before we
do the listening tests I should probably
say something about the accessories the
box is actually quite nice quite well
designed very robust indeed there's a
manual but you likely won't need it and
there's also a handy-dandy little
carrying case pouch that has some simple
audio branding on it there's also a wall
wart this is something that isn't
necessarily included with all these
things makes a little profile one little
simple audio logo on the front a
three-and-a-half millimeter cable not
particularly stunning in terms of the
quality of the cable itself and then
finally a USB a two micro B cables so
that you can actually charge the thing
alright so if you've ever paired a
Bluetooth device to anything then you'll
be able to set this up fairly easily I
realized very early actually once I was
listening to the thing why they went
with such Vickey rubber for the bottom
and the reason is that if it is allowed
to vibrate on the surface that it's
sitting on it significantly degrades the
listening experience so the fact that
they put the care and attention into
doing something like that means a lot to
me it does sound particularly at about
70 to 80 percent volume better balanced
than something like the ultimate ears
boom and I'm gonna stick with this for
the main point of comparison just
because we feel it's pretty similar to
the sp1 and it's a much more mainstream
brand so you're more likely to have a
point of reference I mean okay so for
context jam box by jawbone there's
nowhere near any of these things like
like not anything not even close so it
was a more balanced overall sound with
respect to highs mids and lows we're
still talking about tiny drivers inside
a tiny enclosure that's battery powered
but better is still better with that
said it doesn't get as loud as the boom
not a lot quieter but a little bit
quieter and I found that the quality of
the sound is more dependent on the the
directionality of it the way that it's
facing so if you were to put this sort
of in the middle of a room where people
are gonna be all around it something
like the boom might perform a little bit
better from behind whereas the simple
audio go will be more sad
spying in the corner of a room where
people happen to be or at the beach
you'd want it kind of in front of
everyone as opposed to right in the
middle of the group one thing that's
cool is that it does tie the volume
controlled directly into the software in
your player rather than having separate
audio control this is something that I
have an issue with with the ruckus
series of products so that that was
really handy and it has a battery life
indicator on supported products and
there's actually quite a wide variety of
them I think that's pretty much all
there is to say but it doesn't sound
better than other Bluetooth speakers I
guess the answer is yes all right so for
our audio quality test I'm calling slick
upstairs so we're gonna sit we're gonna
position it such that it would be kind
of like normal like on a desk in front
of you okay so there we go so slick I'm
actually on a speakerphone right now
what would you have to say about the
audio quality of the experience it's not
moving okay so he's not tearful at the
moment if I'm a little bit further away
can you hear me clearly though I guess
is what we're going for here
okay okay well that's excellent okay so
I'll hold on I'm gonna move it a little
bit further away I'm just gonna lower
this table a little bit here okay I can
can you hear me now how are we doing
okay um how about hold on give me a
second how about now okay
does it sound any different yeah no
you're in my pants so yep down the front
of my pants I hope that's okay with you
okay cool so anyway guys thank you for
checking out this video like it if you
liked it dislike it if you just liked it
leave a comment if you have it feelings
