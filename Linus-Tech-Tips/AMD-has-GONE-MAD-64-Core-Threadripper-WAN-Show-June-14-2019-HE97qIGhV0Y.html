other day and one of our one of our
videos that was me untie quickie like
teaching something was in the thread oh
that's of like the person teaching
something to Peter and I was like this
is nuts
ready yeah hey welcome to the LAN show
guys we've got a great show for you
today
hang up yeah I actually haven't seen
this guy in like a month three weeks
something like that yeah he's been like
cavorting about in Asia yeah perfectly
innocent though you know weird kinds of
Tourism Taiwan not yeah not not Thailand
Taiwan
anyways roll the intro oh boy
[Laughter]
Oh
it's not about how you start it's about
the Big Finish I'm trying to hire a new
writing would you believe that this is
like part of the process like how many
dick jokes you can come up with Oh
during the interview no no definitely
not there's there are bonus points for
saying that they think I'm funny though
only one person did it today so um you
know I want to commend that one
individual impersonal on their honesty
oh yeah I want to commend them on their
honesty because everyone else they're
like closet thinking I'm funny cuz I
know everyone thinks I'm funny of course
not so much all right fine fair that's
fine yeah no I'm actually finally
finishing up the writer search that I
started four months ago or something
like that I've been traveling so much
that I just have not had time to do it
properly and I would rather just have it
take too long and go through everyone
fairly versus you know trying to spread
it out over you know many weeks and then
like the people that I evaluate at the
beginning maybe I'm not using the same
standards as the one at the end like I
wanted to be able to sit down and like
do it in big chunks and so we've started
our interviews we're not quite done
interviews yet but we're looking to make
a decision pretty soon so we're gonna be
increasing the writing side writing team
size here by like 40% 60% how many
people you hire death is not a strong
point two to three oh wow I thought this
was one position I know holy cow yeah
two to three are you that I've are you
expanding channels because that's a lot
of writers dad on so we haven't talked
about anything yet okay but actually so
you don't attend Linus Media Group
Monday morning meetings anymore because
you're not an employee of let's look at
the emails and I poke through them
sometimes just to make sure like the
power isn't gonna go out or something I
mean
my gay I actually gave like a big big
speech on Monday so I was I was talking
about
oh wait should we talk about some of the
topics we're gonna have today or should
I just get rid of you know what I'll get
rid of into this we'll talk about topics
in a minute yeah he's pretty harmful so
I was talking about some of the changes
that have been taking place on YouTube
lately and how they've affected our
journals yeah yeah you know YouTube
won't admit anything I found I've had
correspondence with them not just with
my partner manager who was quite a
senior member of the team and who I when
he tells me you know nothing changes or
nothing has changed or that it's
machine-learning and nothing discreet
was changed but that doesn't mean that
it isn't always learning and always
changing and I've even gone higher up
the food chain than that and everyone
insists we didn't change anything we
tweaked no dials but I just I I have a
hard time I have a hard time buying it
because we know from the other things
that YouTube says like I went to
brandcast
and YouTube's talking about you know
raising authoritative voices when it
comes to trying to make sure that their
a platform that promotes credible
information but can you raise an
authoritative voice without suppressing
yeah another one you're saying yes you
can no I'm agreeing with I see yeah
because no you can't yeah you you can't
elevate something without pushing
something else down that's just the way
it works
especially when sorry to jump in here a
second but YouTube kind of at this point
like has the population like they don't
really have a ton of expanding more to
do other than people getting internet or
people getting to the age where they can
watch their own YouTube fun fact they're
no longer going to report on unique
unique visitor increases anymore
interesting you know why because they're
already over two billion a month so like
yeah so like who do you go for now
nothing that they don't do can sound
impressive and sound like growth to
their shareholders anything so they're
just like does this have everyone we're
doing great we're just like we can't
talk about it anymore though because
like a point one percent improvement in
fairness to
still be twenty million more people but
it's like does not impress circle yeah
right yeah so like if you're if you're
taking this platform that like yes it's
expanding don't get me wrong here I
understand that but if you're taking
this platform that has like this kind of
set amount of users if your eye
understands not how it works just hold
on if you start pumping someone you have
to reduce push for others there's only
so many eyeballs and you know there's
been problems on youtubers that have
been identified like the black hole
thing with conspiracy theories or gif
Flat Earth or fake moon landing or
anti-vaccine or whatever else you know
there's there's things that are
relatively low hanging fruit that hold
on a second one moment please
I'm just checking to see if okay cool so
in February YouTube demonetized
anti-vaxxers
Facebook YouTube to suppress anti-vaxxer
content this was from PC Mag and March
7th good so there's other sources so I
don't have to be the source for this so
YouTube is suppressing Antibes accent
now so oh no so there's certain things
that I completely agree with because
that's incredibly dangerous anti box
content not suppressing it because
auntie Vox content is super stupid so
there's things that I agree with but
there's also potential collateral damage
so one of the problems that was
identified on social media in general
not just on YouTube is that once you
watch like if you go OK for lulz you
know you want you show a friend
some stupid ty Lopez video because
you're like that guy you know the guy
with the knowledge you know on remember
that guy and they're like no no I'm like
this guy all of a sudden your your
recommended your ads it's just full of
all those bloody get-rich-quick YouTube
guru z-- yeah and it's so obnoxious okay
so there's this problem that's been
identified in online on social media in
general with echo chambers
and with one search for a given topic
all of a sudden just might slightly be
interested in this yeah not just
interested even just curious and all of
a sudden it's it's put in front of your
face and when you're when you're not as
media savvy you might just see something
on Facebook and go oh it's credible it's
printed in black and white like it's
it's the craziest thing in the world but
that same just because something is
printed in the in black and white
doesn't mean that it's true that same
education that's been trying that people
have been trying to give to people since
1800 is still a big deal today
and so so what happens is you end up in
this in this kind of this death spiral
of fake moon landing flat earth whatever
just from watching one stupid video and
a lot of the people that perpetuate
these conspiracy theories speak in a way
that may not sound authoritative to you
the educated viewer but to other people
apparently does so anyway one of the
ways it might sound earth it might not
sound believable but they're trying to
be authoritative almost always soul
exactly makes sense that it might sound
that way exactly so so one of the
theories we had was that in order to
prevent you know these kinds of echo
chamber II things from happening YouTube
might have been de-emphasizing more
niche content and then pumping stuff
that's safer now that was the theory and
we were kind of like a lower tech we're
kind of niche we're also a niche within
tech like quite frankly a lot of the
content that we upload would have
absolutely no place on a more mainstream
tech content channel like like Marquez's
like come on it wouldn't make sense for
him to do his audience wouldn't like it
and it makes sense that it goes up on
our channel gets fewer views etc etc etc
so we were looking at it going okay well
maybe part of this is we're just more
niche
and so people because we noticed the
biggest dip in viewership was on our
back catalogue maybe what's happening is
instead of people watching one of our
new videos and then getting bombarded
with our massive back catalogue of 4,000
videos something that had a huge benefit
for us and generated a lot of
subscribers maybe instead of that well
they're being fed some marques and some
Austin and some gamers Nexus and
whatever else and to be clear we love
all those guys and that's cool
fine whatever but it definitely did have
an impact on our viewership over the
course of this year so from there I
actually had some really great
conversations at the YouTuber YouTube
creator summit and Derek from veritasium
posted a great video to watch that
posted a great video on his theory about
why his shade ball video went viral and
basically his theory it's funny because
I in some ways I give YouTube like so
much credit like the like the puppet
masters or have all these different
strings they're pulling on his theory
was so simple but I forget whose razor
it is where the simplest solution is is
that Occam's razor so anyway welcome yes
yeah the simplest solution is usually
the correct one his theory was as simple
as YouTube has taken the the the
click-through ratio that you get with
your with the the click enos of your
title and thumbnail and it has shifted
the axis so that a smaller difference in
click through ratio gives it a greater
proportion more promotion on the site
and then a small difference the other
way gives you ALS so instead of it being
kind of linear if your clicks or ratio
is great you're like way up here and if
you're click through ratio sucks you're
like way down here so that was another
interesting theory because we have also
had our click through ratio decrease
this year as we've moved away from more
quick baby titles and click baby
thumbnails which sucks but it's
something that we've committed to our
audience that we're gonna do it just
means that
yeah and then watch the video right away
yeah that actually makes a huge
difference even if you're not gonna
actually watch it right now if you drop
what you're doing start the video put
your phone back in your pocket I don't
care but if you just just click and just
just go about the rest of you to go
watch it later doesn't matter that
initial click through ratio basically
determines everything about how that
video is gonna perform as far as we can
tell that's Derek's theory and it's so
simple it might just be right yes
so anyway LTT has actually struggled in
terms of viewership this year it's
actually it's back up in the last four
to six weeks or so and we are tracking a
really good direction right now but
coming back to our All Hands meeting
this Monday this was a very very long
story Wow or twelve minutes in I'm
coming back I'm engaged right now coming
back to our All Hands meeting this
Monday I actually did stand up in front
of everyone you know when I stand up
during the Monday morning meeting I was
usually serious good news everyone um I
basically went look this is something
that I've really struggled with not just
professionally but also personally you
know trying to figure out what am i
doing what am i doing wrong what can I
do to fix it does the audience just
plain not like me anymore is is is PC
hardware losing its sex appeal like I
was trying to identify what it was
because unless I know what the problem
is I cannot fix it and what I ultimately
came to was that there was a combination
of audience sentiment things that did
need to be addressed you know talking to
the audience directly about things like
doing less offensive thumbnails and
titles that kind of thing you know
making sure we're appending the the
brand and the product wherever that
makes sense things like that I thought
that was part of it I also thought that
some kind of change whether a manual
change or an algorithmic change on
youtubes side was part of the problem
and then the bigger conclusion that I
came to is that maybe if we build our
business correctly it just doesn't
matter because we're ltte has struggled
this year tech linked has actually
picked up
nearly all of the lost watch time nearly
all of the lost viewership and lost
revenue and I kind of went what Eckland
was an accident
after the failure of channel super fun
and a bit of a stagnation period that we
went through with tech quickie to be
clear tech quickies going really well
right now so massive shoutout to John
Dennis okay so after kind of a
stagnation period for tech quickie I was
full like triple down mode on LTT I was
like okay we just throw all the real l
TT has literally 10 times as much staff
as any other channel even now but what I
realized is if I can't ultimately
control it well something that I can
control is this diversification strategy
so teklynx happened by accident my
homeboy Riley lost his job because his
company went out of business and I was
like yo Dawg I've been trying to hire
you forever you twit get out of the
dumpster get get out of the dumpster get
get mad get on a man and you know Riley
he's driven to do the tech news I think
we all know this he's driven to do the
tech news for the people so we create a
tech linked and tech linked was an
accidental complete success like
bat-channel
is freaking awesome I get my tech news
from Tech linked like it's awesome you
get your tech news room nice I genuinely
watch it all the time yeah it's great
and clearly a lot of people do tech
linked regularly gets half a million
views a video even only has like seven
hundred eight hundred thousand
subscribers like it's outstanding yes
just a great show anyway so I was
looking at it going well maybe we're
just maybe we're just thinking about
this too narrowly maybe the answer here
is to broaden the net instead because
that way every time Tech linked
struggles a little bit and you know
needs uh needs a fresh a fresh coat of
lipstick or you know every time LTT
loses its its groove or every time tech
quickie runs out of things people need
explained as if that'll ever happen
something else can carry some of that
weight and we can spread things out the
other really cool thing about tech
linked is that it doesn't rely on me
yeah at the beginning of tech linked I
was far and away the top performing host
on that channel in terms of the views
that each video would get like of the
top 10 I was all but one of them and
then of the bottom 10 I wasn't in any of
them
like I was clearly my face was driving
more clicks really interesting fact over
the last couple of months I've actually
been on the bottom half which i think is
great
that is because it means that Riley and
James and me we've had Dennis host we've
had Alex host we have Yvonne it means it
means that people are connecting with
the team and with the brand not just
Linus Sebastian the person who quite
honestly can't do everything forever and
so I was so so basically I had this the
sort of magic moment where I went ok LTT
is starting to recover which is good if
we can hire but also maybe it's not the
future maybe it's just one part of the
future and we can we can bring people
more types of tech content that bring
them happiness in other you know tech
ways and that's been one of the great
things about the channel so you guys
have expanded is like if you liked Linus
tech tips and you don't want an
education channel or a news channel or a
channel of us playing with weird toys
and being very cringy you could just
keep watching the last actives it didn't
matter and Linus tech tips will as far
as I can tell carry on just as well as
it has and other channels will keep
carrying on and you're maybe expanding
what are you expanding to are you saying
at this I don't know
so it was really interesting because
normally when you enter the hiring
process
you know you might go in and say you
know I really want someone with
JavaScript experience or whatever ok you
set out what your your job requirements
are yeah well I am just looking at all
my applicants and I'm figuring out what
can I do with this person best
applicants are and then I will I will
create programming it's actually there's
some a little bit larger companies than
flow plane that do this in a lot of
different spaces you try to find people
that are extremely talented and
passionate and you go like welp I'll
make you super valuable let's go it's
it's actually if you can manage it it's
a very apparently cool way to do you
think so not necessarily just the new
people but there's people who are
already here that the new people could
nominally v-eight some of their workload
and maybe they could pursue a passion
project James and Riley have been really
into Talk linked do you know takling
yeah okay totally different from tech
linked because it's just one topic
instead of many topics and it's long
instead of short yeah and honestly the
last the first episode kind of rough the
second episode a lot better and the I
was I happen to eavesdrop on sort of a
debrief conversation and they had
identified basically everything that
they needed to fix and they're like
they're iterating and they're they're
going through that creative process and
I'm looking at it going like wow like
this is great this is me witnessing the
machine working yeah and but they don't
have time right so James is produced I
think for LT T's in the last two weeks
because Jake's been on vacation
Anthony's been tied up preparing some of
our really cool booths that we're gonna
have for LTX he's got ten years of PC
gaming he has ten gaming rigs to
configure build and benchmark and setup
demos on like so he's been super busy
alex has been tied up he's actually
putting together our like makerspace
next door right now yeah like so James
we've been leaning on him really heavily
but that means he hasn't had a ton of
time for takling so you know we could
bring these new people and they could
lift some of that load and then we can
kind of spread things that we can figure
out what makes sense I mean as long
person a little bit more agile as long
as we keep a really great team dynamic
here and as long as we stay passionate
about tech whether it's news news is
important Riley
whether it's news or whether it's
something else yeah I guess yeah we're
we're gonna we're gonna do more stuff
though you know I'm
and I'm not done yet you know I was
thinking about it not thinking about
actually quitting but thinking about
phasing myself out
you know it's you've been sort of
talking about it for a while yeah I I
was I was really thinking about it I
mean you and I chatted about it back at
CES I think and I've just been kind of
considering whether like whether I'm
done you know and when when the channels
not performing well because at the end
of the day it's not up to me it's it's
not up to you it's not up to the rest of
my staff like you know everyone here
could go oh no Linus you know we really
want you to keep being the face of the
company in the face of the channel and
I'd go well yeah that's great but if the
audience doesn't want it then like it's
a nice sentiment but it actually doesn't
matter yeah you could pivot to hear me
out you could pivot to like vlogs of you
doing hey hold on hold on a little I'm
not saying daily vlogs or anything just
what am I gonna be a family vlogger no
that actually isn't where I was gonna go
with it hold on hold on you really
enjoyed your like RC car hacking
electronic stuff yeah the guns going a
little bit further away just like you
experimenting with technologies in ways
that you actually want to and just like
fumbling around and trying different
things instead of trying to go with this
like hyper entertainment or hyper so
we've done a bit more battle or whatever
I know yeah
but having a little bit even more
freeform and being like offline
effectives channel so it could be like
pretty separated if you want to here's
one problem with that at four thousand
videos in I've run most of the
experiments that I was kind of like
wondering about when I was in high
school yeah I have so much more
resources now than I used to you know
one of the things I really struggle with
right now is just having too much
resources like people got mad when I
upgraded my gaming rig so there's a
couple problems one is that people don't
think critically sometimes so they were
like why are you calling a Titan
graphics card slow so
the thing is depending on what
generation of Titan is it is it could be
really slow by today's standards it is
it could be literally the fastest card
on the market all the way down to slower
than literally anything that nvidia
currently sells and then you know you've
got people that are frustrated because
for me
upgrading my personal rig is as simple
as showing up at nvidia for a sponsored
project of all things and saying that
i've been finally finding time to play
games lately but a no 18-hundred is like
tugging on my system and then just being
like what I'll put a graphics card in
the mail people people get mad about
that and I get it but the flip side of
it is the alternative I guess is for me
to just not tell you yeah because you
could be an influencer one-twentieth my
size and I use the term influencer as
like the I word so let's say an online
content creator literally one-twentieth
my size and getting something like a
graphics card sent to you is easy I mean
even when we started - tech tips
we had 200,000 subscribers yeah and one
of the first videos that Luke worked on
when we went indie was our review of the
first gtx titan
like it's not like this is new so the
only so if you're gonna get mad at me
about it you're well within your rights
but just understand that anyone else out
there who is not telling you that they
got sampled a card for complete for
doing a project or whatever the case may
be is probably just not telling you
there are exceptions but we believe in
transparency if nothing else also it's
not for my personal rig it's for a video
there you have it so there's your full
disclosure hey guys I'm working on my
personal rig this video was sent or this
video card was sent over by Nvidia this
motherboard was sent over by gigabyte
that's it we are we are fulfilling our
obligation and so if you want me to just
say hey I'm working on my personal rig
here
the parts I'm using I could do that but
I just don't I don't think that's good
enough and not just I don't think that's
good enough the FCC doesn't think that's
good enough so I mean they don't have
any jurisdiction here yeah at all and so
what it's a good idea to I could just
not but for my part I would rather take
a little bit of negativity and just deal
with in there's people that are going to
be resentful but I guess my response to
them would be you know where's your
channel where's your investment in
building something so that people want
you to show their products on it like
I'm not saying that anyone can be a
youtuber I'm just saying that you
literally won't know unless you're like
really trying to do it give it a shot
and then should people be should people
resent you if someone sends you a
graphics card I don't know have you have
you heard Taylor Swift's new song
I haven't oh boy do I sound like her
please don't tell me I said no actually
no no that actually ties in really well
to what I would say right there is the
title as long as you need to calm down
you're being to her and then a part of
the lyrics is like you need to calm down
you're being too loud and the whole
thing is just like leave it alone and
this is I think one of those kind of
situations where like he's he's telling
you I have seen a lot of creators do a
lot worse things where they hide it or
there's something going on in the
background and they're not communicating
that stuff him saying like hey they sent
me this card it doesn't mean go buy this
card it's the best one no and I didn't
say that no I have never recommended a
Titan to anyone no Nvidia knows that
they still sent it yeah it means hey I
got this card I might as well use it
it's gonna fulfill all the things I
really care about sweet doughnuts
literally the fastest card so cool put
it in I don't know and people are all
over the mat because on the one hand
you've got people mad that I'm putting
in an RT X Titan and then on the other
hand you've got people mad that like
what kind of tech influence are you're
not even running us-ally yeah you've got
too many people in your audience
certain points yeah exactly
this shirt is kind of pleasing though we
should probably do that spots oh right
I'm Shirley you mean sponsor spots oh
right oh because our sponsor
integrations and placements surely do
not compete with YouTube's ad formats
yeah we should do a LAN show on that at
some point why we have to call
everything sponsor how would be awesome
yeah just kind of some inside baseball
for you ladies and gentlemen oh yeah
where's the ridge wallet to talk about
uh they might have been hoping mine
would be here oh shoot
but honestly to be straight up hey Jake
Jake Daly drives one is Brandon getting
one saves the day yeah thanks Brandon so
the reason why I don't have mine on me
is because I was traveling you didn't
lose it and I lose my stuff way too
often and I didn't want to lose it
oh all right that is why I actually
believe see this is why he said that
because it's happened multiple times he
lost the first phone that he had earned
as an influencer and I'm gonna use the
word earned because you don't become an
influencer by accident he left it on a
plane there's an LG g3 g3 g3 but it
still haunts me to use that dork
so stop carrying pointless items around
in your pockets like receipts old hotel
room keys or spent gift cards the ridge
wallet is designed to help you carry
less it uses two metal plates that are
bound by a strong elastic band keeping
all your cards tightly together but
still easily accessible its RFID
blocking and it's lifetime guaranteed it
comes in different types of metal like
aluminum titanium and carbon fiber which
is not a type of metal but chill and you
can use offer code ltte to save 10% on a
ridge wallet every wallet calm /l TT o
you wanna hit me with a carbon fiber
whoa it's later go freaking figure who
would have thunk such a thing Wow also
for today's show is Savage Ledger ki
where's my maple buffalo bacon you can
pick between these two and I am
salivating already Oh savage jerky was
made by a group of friends that were
tired of the same mediocre jerky
snack that was flavorful spicy and
something that you wouldn't regret
eating later they've got 13 different
flavors of jerky like Moho ghost pepper
buffalo and my favorite maple buffalo
bacon you might you might regret met
Rick wet you might regret yeah you know
Ghost Pepper buffalo a little bit
partially you won't regret the flavor
you might regret what it does to you hmm
forgot what it does to toilet yeah hey
it's yummy
and they don't just sell jerky you can
try out their hot sauces I haven't tried
the Moho habanero one that I'm holding
up right now but the ghost pepper one is
are the Carolina Reaper one that's the
one I had it's so good I really I
haven't tried this sauce but I really
like this jerky so it's probably good
they've also got their barbecue sauces
and they've even got a spice rub that
goes great on anything they've got a
promo on right now buy three bags of
jerky and get one free heck yeah so
check it out at LMG GG / savage jerky
finally we got this plate boom how do
you like that LTX displayed yeah pull it
off pull it off that's how easy it is to
mount a dis plate make your walls look
awesome with this plate the posters are
made out of metal they're three
millimeters thick they've got den edges
so that you won't cut yourself they use
a magnetic ball mounting system and
they've got 15,000 artists who have
contributed to over 260 thousand
different designs each display sold gets
ten trees planted they offer hassle-free
returns their already gift packed and
with the code LTT you can save 15% so
just head to LMD GG / displayed when oh
and apparently these are for sale
policy these are really sharp that's
cool these are like yeah these are
pretty cool you know how people used to
get those metal car signs in their
garage metal tech signs in your computer
room or you have your computer
that's cool yeah this one made me like a
tiny bit sad because you're not on it
yep mm-hmm I checked yeah I was curious
all right back to the show ladies and
gentlemen why don't we talk about tech
topic yeah why don't we talk about the
64 core thread Ripper yes so this is a
rumor right now rumor status this is
supposed to by clueless gamer on the
forum it's definitely a rumor WCC f Tech
they claim AMD is working on a 64 core
128 thread thread Ripper part for launch
in q4 of 2019 now this was something
that was very recently rumored to be
going away all together thread Ripper
was like on ambe's roadmap not on it and
then now there's a rumor that we're
still gonna have it I'm gonna say
something unpopular who I don't think
this skill makes any sense
I think AMD has such a strong end I am
take everything I'm saying as a rumor
and the reason for that is that we
haven't actually seen third gen rising
performance yet yeah so I am oh we're
coming back to this I am assuming based
on AMD's numbers that they have provided
that they are not lying
yeah and that third gen riser kicks ass
riser dice a riser riser risin sorry all
right so I am assuming that they are not
bold crapping around like riser right I
want you to make a riser product line
all right here just a little Thanks yeah
look like a nipple pinch so I'm say I'm
going based on that third gen Rison it's
gonna be awesome
so here's my here's my counter to thread
Ripper pitch you already have 32 core
thread Ripper okay that already exists
on the rise in third gen mainstream
platform
you are already going to have a 16 core
32 thread chip
I would I would postulate that for the
vast majority of workloads that is
already more than enough I realized I'm
changing my tune a lot because back when
Intel was determined to keep quad core
at the maximum for mainstream forever I
was like yo where's my cores for
mainstream I absolutely think so for
some scenarios where you're trying to
build out like serverless clouds and
stuff by epic yeah I just it feels
completely unnecessary because risin
whatever it is 30 90 a future of the
epic processors 31 no epic is epic is
gonna be on there so Zen - epic is gonna
be called broom Oh coming okay so I
could still see them doing thread Ripper
as a 20 24 32 lineup or something like
that but that's three SKUs it's hard to
say if it's worth maintaining a
completely separate socket and chips
that platform for it because it's
already like it's like it's it's so
niche
the only reason I could think of to do
it would be to just put the screws to
Intel but even then it's totally
unnecessary like we already kind of have
Intel isn't gonna have anything to
compete with even a 32 core thread
Ripper within the next 18 months as far
as I can tell
yeah so this is just when do we get to
the point where we're honestly just
giving up too much of our single
threaded clockspeed
for the sake of having more cores and if
we really need 64 cores why aren't we
just getting an epic there is very very
little that I can think of even for a
workstation workload that needs 64 CPU
cores I hadn't heard
Rome you call that Rome like our ome
yeah yeah okay I hadn't heard the Rome
news so it sort of made sense to me is
there spec soap for what Rome will be up
to 64 course so basically they're just
repurposing Rome yeah as a workstation
product which I mean I guess if you're
building the damn thing anyway okay
maybe if it's easy
doesn't make it yeah the thing about
thread rapport those it's overclockable
I don't know that I would recommend
overclocking a 64 core processor so it
just feels like the the product without
a customer because you're either a
little bit lower than it probably or a
little bit higher than it probably
there's it's fairly unlikely you'll be
right on so if I'm AMD and there's any
truth to it would be fun the rumors here
yeah so okay if this isn't about
building a practical product yeah and
you don't actually care if anybody buys
it yeah that's what's gonna happen based
on what we know what we're taking AMD's
word for so far with third gen rising it
should have excellent performance per
watt the sustained clock speeds that it
can hit should be pretty decent even
with high core counts and its IPC
improvements over last gen Zen are
looking pretty good yeah so with all of
that in mind Intel's
highest end and like it's like full
desperation move that W series 28 core
Xeon that the overclockable one on that
you can put on there's like three
motherboards that exist for it or
whatever so so Intel's best possible
response without bringing back like
Skull trail dual socket overclockable
systems is 28 corners so what we know
then is that if AMD goes 32 core which
is what they currently have and what
they could easily and comfortably do
with the next gen thread Ripper they
will probably beat that processor by a
little so when you're looking at the
like review the the halo product versus
the halo product and you might be on top
but like by a bit and it might depend on
if it's like an ATX
five twelve enabled workload or whatever
if AMD releases a 64 core processor they
know that for the first time ever no no
baby didn't tell the SS they beat them
to do a core so for the first time in
over ten years they know that they will
not just beat Intel at the top of the
benchmark leaderboards they will
absolutely destroy them pardon
my french
sorry button yeah I need the button huh
like we're talking there will be
benchmark graphs where people are
showing you know video encoding in
ffmpeg or Cinebench where AMD literally
is outperforming until by a factor of
two yeah that's the only reason that I
can think of for them to do it it sounds
fun and with how like successful they've
been for the last little while maybe
that type of fun is becoming worth it
we're like the the last round of
processors from AMD I would not have
necessarily said the same thing well now
that they're selling anything at a
profit they actually have some that's
what I'm like yeah that helps yeah it's
cool though I don't know I've been very
happy with all the same B stuff and with
constant security vulnerability problems
coming from Intel it's it's it's good
time over in that camp so the rumor is
that it would be socket compatible with
existing tr4 motherboards after a BIOS
update if there is speculation that is
probably a 14 nanometer part there we're
expecting it to be priced in the 2500 to
3000 dollar range and they're aiming for
mid Q for 2019 because they have
something planned for CES next year's or
at the very latest January 2020 actually
I don't even know if these are Xen to
course which is interesting because if
they're not 7 nanometre they wouldn't be
as far as I know forgive me for not
having all the details about this rumor
product yeah but we'll see we'll see how
it goes either way
the only way that I could see this
making any sense for AMD is just as a
gigantic fu which is fun which is fun
yeah yeah alright it's being a fun Xbox
Scarlett announced you wanna talk about
this one yeah sure this is awesome by
the way
and if you're in the computer space you
like new OU consoles suck no it's
awesome shut up because every time new
really awesome consoles come out
everything steps up a little bit because
developers are gonna be making for
compatibility across the platform and
you want this this is good for you this
is very good for you
also consoles are basically computers
now yes extremely much so ports don't
suck so hard
yeah that's it's great it's actually
it's fantastic anyways Microsoft
announced it at e3 2019 there's a bunch
of stuff that going on sat you through
2019 they're there they're apparently
will have a physical disk drive which is
actually important to know because
they've been talking about maybe not
having that for a little while now first
I care ah
this is a really important comment
clashing cube India says line it's got a
great body Thank You Daniel go ahead I
did I did
autocompletes for you and I on YouTube
recently just out of pure here pure
curiosity yeah and one of your top ones
is topless really or shirtless or
something but effectively without a
shirt on that's uncomfortable there you
go cool nobody should want to see my
weird chest hair tuft it's a custom
designed AMD processor using Zen - and
Navi architectures sexy from a pure
processing perspective it's four times
more powerful and while I was reading
this I expected it to say the original
Xbox one but it's the Xbox one X which
is that's actually like that's cool
capable of running games at 120 Hertz
frame rates now I want to jump in for a
second and say that that is a BS way to
talk about the power of a game console
that's true what games are we talking
about what what textured the resolution
and this at what draw distance and this
is gonna apply to the next note as well
keynote says 8k compatibility for a
brief second like yeah is it
this stuff makes me so mad
so there were people posting again on
the personal rig update one they're like
PC gaming is a joke because even with
the Titan RT X it was still only running
at 70 to 85 frames per second as if it's
that simple it depends on how much you
cranked up the details you remember the
console comparison video we did yeah at
the last big launch of the technically
like the last big console launch it's
just been forever you guys should do
another one yeah we totally should
doing a video called console marketing
is stupid okay but PC marketing is
really stupid - I know but console
marketing we are ready is SLI ready
that's really stupid and I don't have to
accept that so the reason that marketing
a console as 4k is that everything has
trade-offs I could run games at 4k on a
six-year-old computer what games at what
image quality settings pong exactly I
could run I could I could do whatever
the this laptop I could run a game at 4k
120 frames per second if I don't tell
you what game it is and what it freaking
looks like that is not meaningful
information it's like it's like having a
multivariable algebra equation and
you've only got one number and
everything else you've got variables X Y
Z ABC gamma freaking it's all over the
place it would be cool if they tried to
maybe use a first party title like for
Microsoft pretty easy one to call it
halo if they were like halo and more
will run at 120
or something anyway I'll let you finish
imma let you finish but imma let you
finish
apparently there's a quote saying we're
seeing over 40 times performance
increase over the current generation
from the SSD and yeah yeah yeah to be
yeah I probably should have said that
because the SSD is being used as virtual
Ram so it's gonna share a little bit and
moving through worlds without waiting
for screens to load is going to maybe
happen sometimes with some games
that's so funny - because it's like
they're like yeah what an innovation and
SSD yeah I mean while we're like hey
yeah you mean like when people were
upgrading for freaking like wow Burning
Crusade and to be clear people have been
manually upgrading consoles with us for
a bit - it's it's honestly like Burning
Crusade days that was kind of when
people started upgrading and putting
well on an SSD so they wouldn't load
when they went but yet like come on Halo
Infinite is confirmed as a launch title
but also to be clear halo infinites
coming to PC and Xbox 1x as well I did
uh it's possible that a new elite
controller a series - no I've said
before Peter that's coming and I'm
excited I love my elite controller
except when it broke it's actually the
only Xbox controller I've ever had break
is my elite controller that's kind of
sad how did it break d-pad playing cross
code and use the d-pad to switch between
the different elements okay I'm starting
soon you said something about sorry you
said something about keyboard and mouse
versus controller should I keyboard
mouse it it's I think okay I've never
actually played it on keyboard and mouse
so the only experience I have with the
keyboard mouse controls I didn't even
realize you're gonna play it with the
keyboard mouse because it's like or
top-down sprite based RPG and I just
grabbed a controller the first time I
play it because like this is how you do
that yeah so the only reason I even know
you can control it with keyboard and
mouse it's cuz I was sitting on a plane
and I kept like accidentally like aiming
and firing at stuff and I didn't realize
I was touching my touchpad with the back
of my hand so I kind of played around
with it a little bit and it seems like
particularly for quickly aiming keyboard
and mouse would be way better yeah
that'd make sense kind of a rule I
really enjoyed like the laid-back
console experience of using a controller
with it
and like you're good enough with a
controller that it probably shouldn't
matter okay yeah okay I could do it I
beat the game no problem there were
challenging parts but like I could do it
and it wasn't so did you ever play
Psychonauts no I I played a demo
count so Psychonauts towards the end
it's like it's like kind of unfair like
there's some really frustrating parts
that are like I'd say amazing game
design for a very skilled player like
you should be able to you should be able
to beat it on the first try if you're
really really good
unless it's Dark Souls or something like
obviously there are games that are
designed to just kick your ass over and
over and over again yeah but I'd say
most games if they're balanced correctly
if you're really really good and you are
mastering every new skill as it comes at
you you should be able to be level on
the first trial like Psychonauts like
really really tough so I'd say cross
code is is everything is beautiful on
the first try if you've been paying
really close attention with a controller
there's no I never felt like it was
totally unfair okay all right
current Xbox one that accessories will
work with scarlet which is cool and
apparently launching holiday 2020 so
we're still quite a ways out but yeah
yes gem this is bacon turkey it's pretty
legit actually yeah that's scarlet it's
not coming for a while but it's very
exciting that's cool we should maybe
stay on the Microsoft path and jump down
to the Xbox game pasture PC yeah so
basically it's like a steam like thingy
but it's a subscription-based it's ten
bucks a month or five bucks a month if
you sign up between the beta or one
dollar if you sign up now but it's ten
bucks a month over 100 PC games
available at launch and it's not game
streaming so you still need to like
download the game and play it off your
computer and stuff so here's some of the
games here I'll just screen share with
you guys but doop-doop 333 results
honestly as with pretty much all of
these things so here let's filter by PC
games sure hooray 108 results that's
more like it yeah do a lot of it is
stuff I have never heard of Bursa see if
your about your first party stuff I
think the most interesting things in
here are going to be the first party
games other than that they're gonna be
mostly things that could have been very
cheap if you caught bought them on
certain sales or things that you're
probably not going to be super
interested in just because unless you're
like equally interested in literally
every game genre because there's a whole
bunch of different game genres maybe
this is a really good game is it wrong
if I'm a little offended on spy someone
trying to capitalize on mr. Rogers he
was so against that kind of stuff is
that supposed to be hello neighbor
come on wearing like a plaid sweater
vest oh it's a super creepy game though
it's it has nothing to do with I hear
yeah I see where you're going can't say
hello neighbor without it yeah being
Fred Roger I got you but you're trying
to like I've never played it but I think
you're trying to like break into that
guy's house and he's trying to like
catch you and then yeah I think he's
told me a shovel because he attacks you
when I highly recommended horses amazing
we can I played through it ago so this
fire is great very good I actually
really enjoyed Lucky's tale really yeah
did you not I don't think I played it
very much
oh yeah it was like it's like the one
thing that I ever played on the oculus
yeah I did
I ran it on the 5 ha ha I had bought an
oculus so I don't even care yeah so
because I bought one for LMG yeah
so I ran that on an unauthorized system
with no it's interesting cause so we
called this so hard and we got so much
crap for it mostly me I guess not not
the crap I mean the calling yeah but we
are you guys didn't even cover the new
stuff did anyone complain
I'm yes actually I need to cover the
quest people are mad but not the
roofless who cares about the rift s yeah
there you go yeah no one cared about the
rift s people do care about the quest
the quest seems to be doing pretty well
I'm really skeptical about it but I am
trying to maintain an open mind I will I
was I was going to come here and say I
understand but I think you should cover
it because I don't think Linus tech tips
should lose the foothold of covering VR
contact because I think it will be
really big at some time at some point my
aim time cross codes in-game pass hey
hey I already bought it so whatever
that's cheap yeah I love that game so
much I wouldn't it's not like I'm gonna
play it again it's hard not necessarily
recommend it it's not my own oh I'll
recommend it ok no problem it's not my
favorite game or anything but if I'm
being really honest I think it's better
than a lot of the RPGs that I treasure
having played as a kid
Oh like I think it's objectively better
I've got some nostalgia class yeah like
I think if I'm being honest with myself
a breath of the womb a breath of the
wild is the greatest game of all time
dude here Bertha well - I don't think I
care
Oh what was magic about breath of the
wild was how utterly different it was I
had no temptation whatsoever to download
the DLC okay I was just like I was like
you know what was a great contained
experience yeah you know what I'm
finished happy with my meal a really
great book yep and you closed the last
cover and you kind of sit there you go
wow
they didn't produce season 8 I'm awesome
yeah yeah I'm kind of done but I man I
put so many hours in the breath of the
wild like I just I yeah I I tried to
tell myself no Final Fantasy 6 is still
my favorite game but it's just not like
breath of the wild Final Fantasy 6 I
still adore the characters but if I you
know if I go back and I play it as an
adult who knows my way through the game
there's actually not a lot that happens
whereas and you know what I think the
same is probably true for cross-code
cross-code can get a little grindy at
times not that much actually happens but
what's great about it is I absolutely
adore the characters I still there's a
strong connection there I went back and
played some of moreland recently yeah
it's more when's the game that I've
always said is my favorite game and I
think I think it still is but but I
don't think I would have the time or the
patience now to play it the way you did
yes and to get out of it what you did
yes that makes sense I don't think I
could extract the experience I had with
morrowind anymore which makes me really
sad but like you done growed up yeah to
certain degree because like the thing
with morrowind was I the the game starts
they give you this like package thing
and you're supposed to go give it to
someone mmm and it was worth something
so I just sold it all the time and that
was what started the main quest so I
actually really thoroughly enjoyed the
game for like months before I realized
the game had a main quest yeah and I was
like oh god and then this unlocked this
whole other part of the game and it was
it was very interesting to wander and
explore and I don't have the now I'm
like I have time to play a game
I must extract enjoyment out of game as
much as possible not just I'm gonna go
enjoy myself and that's what was so
magical about breath of the wild to me
so most of the games that I've loved a
lot have been because I love the
characters like even some of the less
popular Final Fantasies I actually know
most of them the characters are kind of
cliche
I've really loved six so it's because I
love the characters and that was
something that was a little bit
different for breath of the wild because
I loved the exploration not the like the
link character is utterly uninteresting
to me okay there's not much to know
no the Zelda character is she might as
well be Princess Peach they are
completely interchangeable to me they're
like a damsel in distress but over the
years because you know empowerment they
have become strong independent women and
that's great but that doesn't that's
still completely two-dimensional and you
know what I'm sure that there's like
supplementary manga or something like
sure yeah some type of additional some
people only play the games and you got a
read the lore you got to give me
something to work with here like link is
literally a silent protagonist and and
that's that's a storytelling mechanism
but but what was magical about breath of
the world was definitely a the
exploration and what I usually love
about games is the characters so it's
just it's hard for me to admit that my
favorite game is not one that's about
the characters especially because I
would never go and explore a world that
I've already explored but I might go
have a story retold to me about
characters that I love so for me breath
of the wild has no replay value whereas
I have played Final Fantasy 6 through to
the end at least half a dozen times and
like and almost through probably 20
times to reaffirm all of these points
yeah it's on the same map yeah yeah
there's no it's like effectively and you
said I wouldn't buy a DLC they were in
in one of their interviews they
basically said it would have made sense
to be a DLC if DLCs were conventionally
seen as like multitudes bigger than what
they are
so it's an expansion pack it's basically
we're back to that yeah okay they're
saying it's like the majorities
masks I never played in majora's mask me
neither actually so I don't know how
accurate this is but the Majora's Mask -
ocarina of time if there's on the same
map it's an expansion even know if yeah
it's like a really big expansion pack
yeah but expansion packs are really big
yeah oh no I was going further back than
that I was actually gonna use Warcraft -
I'm trying to remember don't don't tell
me don't tell me it's Warcraft - tides
of darkness and beyond the dark portal
yeah it's it's beyond the dark portal
they beyond the dark portal campaign is
just as long as the tides of darkness
can I remember quickly Frozen Throne
campaign is just it's just as long
you're right it is and and like
completely overhauls and changes the
game but it's the same sort of supreme
commanders expansion pack had a campaign
that was just as long and added a race
like it's an expansion pack yeah we just
don't call them that anymore I guess
somewhat dying oh it's possible alright
time for all rights actually was there
anything else you really wanted to hit
today cuz otherwise I was gonna do some
super Jets we've we should maybe talk
about LTX cuz there's a thing all right
there's like a ton of LTX news yeah okay
VR RC car is going to include four cars
but isn't a race anymore it's now a
first person view experience so we're
designing the tracks and it'll include
some fun little Easter eggs for you guys
to find that's probably a good idea
we'll be playing Robo recall vacation
simulator and winland - at the VR
experience booth that will include eight
HTC vibes a big step up from last year's

Colton is slowly processing LTX

stage planned events oh wow ok panel AMD

industry insights with MSI that's gonna
be great we're gonna have Cliff out
Oh interesting yep so and I already sent
him a lot of my questions like maybe
like yeah tell me who's hard to work
with should be good he's pretty sure
he's gonna get fired we're gonna be
playing like a family feud sort of funny
thing and then we've got a panel running
a YouTube business the earlier so that
should be an interesting one now I'm not
the only one on all these panels we're
actually going to be leaning on some of
our creators to come up and help us with
these twitter / floatplane Q&amp;amp;A with LMG
part 1 &amp;amp; 2 is at 11:30 on the second day
where the warships tournament with -
never played the game so that'll be
interesting sweet apparently I get it I
get like a stacked like special ship
that's like LTT colored and stuff what
so like people so i because i don't know
how to play the game I have kind of an
advantage PC versus Mac panel budget
versus performance panel award ceremony
and a farewell MSI is apparently sending
us 20 little lucky dragons to sell and
build on the floor plan oh my goodness
for show on the floor plan look at all
the updates today those you OC seats oh
yeah we expanded it heck yeah okay so
here I can't read all this stuff it's
gigantic though so this is 590 b-y-o-see
seats this is pc free play where the
systems are already there VIP / staff /
crew b ofc so that's where you'll be
luke okay here's a stream zone so this
is all kind of like Dreamhack II things
then we've got the stage then over here
you've got LT X and I'm having a hard
time reading so the VIP staff crew B oh
I see that's floatplane is gonna be in
there as well yeah okay yeah yeah
over here is the Indy zone I believe
this is the case toss I can't read any
of this stuff but maybe it's I don't
know it's super awesome oh yes so this
is a problem-free geek is actually kind
of in trouble so we just wanted to take
a moment to shout them out big time for
being such an amazing supporter of LTX
without them we wouldn't have been able
to get the hundreds of dead motherboards
to use as the motherboard house of cards
booth they provided twenty plus cases to
throw at the infamous case toss they
source twenty computers for us to use in
the PC build workshop like dead
components that people can learn to
assemble yeah sent us a number of unique
motherboards for the guests that
motherboard booth a lot of this would
have been difficult if not impossible to
do without them so free geek is a
Vancouver based nonprofit community
organization that reuses and recycles
donated electronics they offer education
and job skills training and provide free
or low-cost computers to the public
they've been an integral part of the
event and they're in a bit of a tough
spot right now because recycling rates
are falling and you know what not too
much details but we'd really appreciate
your guys's help to help them keep their
doors open it what they do is kind of
important so it's free geek Vancouver
org where you can go to learn how you
can contribute because you know
everything from scrap yard Wars to retro
mods to our sleeper PC series like they
have hooked us up in ways that are like
not money but just PC community
relationship ways this is the kind of
stuff you want in the PC community
because yes if you think back to your
current or maybe younger self depending
on where you're at yeah there's a point
in time where if you're really into pcs
these types of outlets is what you need
to lean on maybe the only way that you
could afford one yeah to be completely
honest so so inspiring new young or less
financially fortunate minds in our space
is how is Callie
yeah all right so guys go check it out
that's free geek Vancouver org and we
should go ahead and call it some super
Chad's yeah Mari says finally YouTube
premium got sick of ads good stuff and
thank you for the $2 to making you two
presumably Logan frozen sniper you guys
too sup Spencer Connor says what were
you doing with Gavin couple of really
cool things
Gabby knows what you're doing no they
don't yet we did a couple of things we
determined once and for all whether 240
Hertz monitors have an advantage over 60
Hertz for gamers
oh yeah and in a bunch of really
interesting ways so does it affect
reaction time does it affect your kill
rate does it affect the way that you aim
so we used slow-motion 1,000 frames per
second footage to watch how a gamer
reacts at 60 Hertz versus 240 watch Edie
we did okay good huh he's a lot better
at 240 Hertz but I won't spoil anything
else about it because the findings with
me and Gavin were also interesting but
in completely different ways yeah I was
I was I was hoping you were doing a
spectrum but if you weren't doing a
spectrum I was hoping it was that we
were yeah so we had IDI at the top at
the top end we had Gavin as more of like
a casual and then we had me as sort of
like I used to be okay I guess you're
good at games
my aim is fantastic actually my spread
was pretty close to Ed's Wow but what
game my my kill time was much higher we
used csgo with an autist night okay and
then we had a we had a target basically
a Dan at an undetermined roasting time
well the reason for the auto snipe was
we wanted to give the if you got a
headshot you took him down in one we
told everyone to go for headshots
but if you hit a body shot we wanted it
to be possible to take down the target
in the time that you had while they ran
across the hallway
so you basically had you had a pixel
that you had to point at
and then you didn't know when that was
gonna come and you had to take him out
as fast as you could as he ran across so
yeah it's really really cool test and
then what we did with the knowledge that
we gained from working with Gavin was we
produced a second video the next day
determining once and for all whether
wireless mice so we devised a mechanism
to hit a mouse complete a circuit light
up a light to show us the exact moment
that they make contact and then we were
able to use one millisecond frames at a
thousand frames per second to see how
long it takes the crosshair on the
monitor behind it to start to move so we
were we weren't able to actually
determine down to one millisecond which
mouse was faster because we don't have
the equipment to measure that we can't
intercept the signal from the mouse but
we were able to tell if any monitor on
the market could possibly give you the
feedback fast enough that you could
detect a difference yeah and it's gonna
be a really really interesting video so
that's what I was doing with Gavin
Commissioner says if the 64 core thread
Ripper was cheap not sure where you're
going with that cuz it sure as heck
won't be supp Jason will Briggs westerly
Derek YouTube premium gives free super
chats I think that's what like most of
this is Zack says put it towards some
tooling for the mill hold man that
workshop is gonna be freakin awesome see
Bart hashtag saved panels super fun 20
bucks if only it were that you know
what's really funny is it is not
impossible that channel super fun could
end up resurrected as part of this
diversification push we'll see it's not
dead it's just you want to pour it you
want to know a fun a fun little fact
here the Ember the pigeon the pigeon was
it I think it's called a pigeon Apple
pigeon Pippin oh the Pippin yeah yeah
the at mark it's that it's probably paid
for itself by now as it it's like three
million views or something really yeah
how much did we pay for that stupid
thing again I think was 500 bucks Oh Oh
can literally buy like a brand new Xbox
1x for what we paid for it the worst
console and like a game and some
controller see ya 3 million views hell
yeah
sup Nick oh oh he wants us to talk about
the merge so this this is our hot item
right now this hoodie is finally for
sale yeah did you get one yet okay oh
really
ouch nick is my savior because my
luggage was lost you lost it note I did
not know an airline did yeah an airline
did a hundred percent okay and my
sweater was in there but Nick Nick
swooped in and got me no all right so
this is the one he did but either way
this is the one that's like the hot
seller on the store right now TT store
calm it's got like a little look it's
got a little logo here it's got the
phone pocket on this side that holds
even really big phones this is an early
prototype so actually the we had
enlarged the phone pocket after this one
cuz it didn't really fit very well it
was like hard to get it in and out also
this one see how yours goes a little bit
lower we made it about an inch longer
because this is an early one because it
was always riding up on me like that I
also have a rather tall torso and it
fits on me perfectly fine I know some
people ask about how different fitting
things work so we changed the zipper to
YKK instead of whatever this is that's
that's good yeah so we made some quality
and some wearability improvements that's
why these projects take so long because
you're sending feedback you're waiting
for new samples you're sending more
feedback you're waiting for new samples
if it was just as simple as like getting
a shirt printed this merch stuff would
have paid for itself ages ago as it is
were okay so we're making money on every
item we sell but we're deep in the red
in terms of the total investment that we
put in but honestly I'm so much happier
wearing our ok party the the stuff I was
most upset about losing
in that life okay one random little
tidbit I lost literally every single
pair of bottoms that I own except for
these shorts that I'm wearing in that
luggage said Wow I don't have very many
ball can it take you a long time to get
free bottoms to replace those bottoms
because I know you won't pay that's why
I only had that many I know it's because
same jeans I've had for like seven years
I believe you but okay as an outside
source
the shirts are insanely comfortable the
constellation one is actually my like
favorite shirt which is also gone out of
stock right now we're working on getting
more the problem is we can't get that
color of shirt and so we're working on
an overseas source but unless it meets
the standard of the ones that we are
using now we are just we'd rather be
completely out of stock and not sell
anything been compromised anymore I'm
just tired of it and it's insane I'm
just gonna step it again still outside
source your shirts for 20 bucks yeah
basically no influencer shirts or 20
bucks right now twenty dollars a shirt
is the like five to ten years ago
pricing for most of this kind of stuff
which is pretty awesome
the shirts feel great the printing is
great the sweaters are thin yeah which
is usually bad but it's not no it's like
a French terry yeah like it's not like a
cheap finish I haven't had a sweater
like this before so every finn's
whatever that i've had sucked this one's
fantastic i slept with it over my face
when I didn't have another option while
I was in Taiwan it was great and then
it's gone but I was really sad and I got
a new one we're trying to we're trying
to keep the pricing reasonable that's
like yeah the big 60 bucks for a sweater
again it's sweaters are kind of
expensive but it takes us a long time to
make this stuff so yeah yeah go buy some
pants well I have two now okay so I will
start Lord really wants to do joggers so
joggers would be do i I don't really
like them though so my my my new thing
with the merch actually I listen to a
talk from Kris Jenner of all people you
know what you can say what you want
about the content but you have to
respect the business savvy and she was
like look
focus focus on what you actually are
passionate about and it's a lot harder
to screw up and so I'm going you know so
I I so I got back to the office and I
cancelled the joggers project I don't
care about them okay and I was like nope
we're gonna do stuff that like I care
about a lot so the underwear that's
coming yeah it's really nice okay good
because I lost also a very high
percentage of my underwear
the underwear fairly soon literally my
entire wardrobe
BLTs the under which I'm okay with it's
like really nice yeah anyway Connor says
can you recommend a battery pack that
can power a USBC powered laptop I don't
know anything from like like anchor
stuff yeah anchor just go anchor I guess
we can gaming there as well I mean we're
getting so many free super chats guys
thank you
twigs dark stalker as arrow Lee gamer
Matt Aaron also it goes this is the new
CPU shirt and it's super cool yeah I
like that it was like tech yeah but if
you but you can also identify it yeah
yeah distro tube this show is cool have
you guys ever considered switching to
new lifts gnu / linux find out more
about free software software freedom in
the new project at new org oh thank you
sweet we had never heard of them let me
get right on that for our adobe premiere
editing work though well I'm not I'm not
trying to be a hater we use Linux where
it makes sense like our storage servers
for example flip all of Luke's
floatplane crap right it's on Linux yeah
but we're not ready to advocate
switching to Linux for like a media
production environment it's not it's not
a thing yet and before you send another
superjet which i appreciate by the way
about DaVinci Resolve yes we're aware of
it but it doesn't do everything Michael
Freddie Lazaro Lachlan Danny
Arash thank you very much Midland
says good evening guys wondering if
there's a way to clone an internal SSD
to an internal software raid one SSD
array that is a tremendous question and
I have actually tried to figure out how
to do it I don't know why with the Intel
raid when you create it you can't just
say hey all of that that one Drive that
one's good all of that - the other one -
you have to clear them when you create
it and it seems like the kind of thing
that I do know that there are like there
are values that you that you write when
you create a raid that kind of tie the
two together it just seems like the kind
of thing that someone over the last
couple of decades might have engineered
a solution to by now yeah as far as I'm
aware I don't know of a way to do it I'm
sorry
rehan says the search on floatplane is
there but doesn't seem to be effective
yeah I know they're working on it yep
there's actually like a fix for it but
it's just not up yet Lorenz sorry don't
think about quitting I really miss you
lately on the channel don't worry I mom
I'm not going anywhere
QWERTY to be honest I love all the other
staff but if you're done I am - I like
having the variety but I'm here for you
I appreciate that but also I appreciate
the support for the rest of the staff
because they're awesome
niche requests podcasts interesting Ben
Burrell says water cool the new Mac Pro
worker only this is a podcast yeah this
is a podcast by the way we already have
a podcast Jax well said story driven
podcasts no like for file watching rig
upgrade Thunderbolt config is it still
in the closet okay so I had to rip the
gigabyte board back out that night and
put my old board back in because I don't
have a Thunderbolt three two found a
bolt to scepter so a really sad story
especially because Brandon and I stayed
late to finish that video Oh No so I
ended up reusing that motherboard in a
you know I won't spoil it but there's
more videos coming up that narrative is
far from done
nabilla says hey Linus you're paying too
much attention to the feedback great to
have the feedback but do what you like
man we enjoy seeing you stat do the
stuff you enjoy so that's good that's
important but also I do need to take
feedback because it does matter to
it's just like filtering it that's the
key Dave just because I want to one-up a
rash since $24.99 oh thanks Dave
Luke needs a chair that says that
floatplane he does oh yeah I'll be cool
what a terrific point um okay
and in like blue Jesus Franco says
YouTube gave me this so here you go game
breaker says yellow Linus what did I
miss
I only joined like a minute ago are you
for real bro we're just going to recap
the whole the whole LAN show you know
what you can't blame a guy for trying
you gotta respect that though at least
you took a shot you gotta try things
yeah but yeah you know what yeah yeah
shoot for the moon right because you
miss if you miss then it might come down
on an old lady somewhere yeah thanks you
and I Jake says would love a vlog
channel nope I'm out I'm done I'm
telling you man I'm telling you man I
actually have a pretty good vlog channel
idea I don't have time to do it right
now though but it's like it's pretty
different it's pretty different oh wow I
don't know if I can get through all
these whenever we do super chats like
earlier in the show and people like oh
wow they're actually gonna remember
super chats today we get a bunch of them
and then we can't finish them I would
strongly recommend if you guys want to
like do super chats do them earlier in
the show because then we'll get to those
ones first if I sex row says what do you
think about this set up an epic 74 o1p
with 64 gigs of DDR for ECC 5 GTX 280s
and a 4x4 you get this the Onan M Zed 31
a r0 motherboard sounds like a like a
machine learning setup or something
y'all be careful
weird config what you're inviting is
config feedback from everyone oh yeah oh
oh right yeah I'm sorry I don't do that
I go post on the new builds a section of
the forum yes Thank You Luke good call
no problem I do this stuff sometimes
okay all right
but up but down it down make sure okay
yeah and we're done
no I guys bye see you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel

still not up I am Blaire says I have two
friends that are for EXO and can't ever
find YouTube merge that fits I think

say is that even three XL a lot of the
merch that we source is like like like
