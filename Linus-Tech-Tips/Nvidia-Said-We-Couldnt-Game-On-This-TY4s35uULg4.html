let's call it a downturn let's be honest
a huge crash in 2018 so there is no
shortage of great deals to be had on
graphics cards that were used for
cryptocurrency mining on sites like eBay
but one class of cards that there
appears to be no use for other than to
melt them down and salvage the gold and
other valuable elements is crypto
specific cards like this one from
gigabyte this is AP 106 it's actually
very similar to a gtx 1066 pin power
dual fan cooler except for oh one small
problem it doesn't have any display
outputs and not only that but the
drivers have been locked down by Nvidia
so it can't be used for gaming because
these were designed only for
cryptocurrency mining but could this
card be used for gaming
well Chinese site Taobao has a seller
who says they can and is selling them
with a modified firmware that they claim
will work 67 US dollars that is under a
third the price of a gtx 1066 gig
will it work well I'll be damned if I
know but I'm sure gonna find out Oh
after this message from our sponsor
thermal take thermal takes 8,500 has a
modern minimalistic design and brushed
aluminum panels with dual hinge swing
tempered glass doors check it out today
at the link in the video description
so we're not gonna go through the whole
process yet because we won't know
anything that old by the way Anthony's
gonna be joining me for this video hi
he arranged the whole thing which was
apparently like a big hassle getting
this thing yeah apparently the seller
wouldn't actually ship to Canada I don't
know what the reason was not sure it's
legal or whatever but anyway long story
short Dennis had to contact on the
directly and in order to get it shipped
they had to put it down as a computer
mouse but it's here and it seems to be
exactly what we were expecting it's as
advertised including all the dust and
grime that's built up on it from
presumably months of cryptocurrency
mining in a dirty warehouse somewhere
anyway back to what I was saying before
we're not ready to rock on that just yet
because we won't know how it compares to
a regular gtx 1060 unless we go ahead
and run one so this is a run-of-the-mill
EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 superclub okay
it's not quite right of the mill so
we're gonna run just a quick shadow of
the Tomb Raider benchmark so that we
have a before to compare to our after
now we don't need to run a whole suite
of benchmarks because we're not
comparing cards across different
architectures different brands or even
different GPUs these are both running
the same graphics core on them so all we
need to know is did they cripple it in
some meaningful way or is it all just a
software lock and we need to get our
drivers installed for this puppy
speaking of which both the cars should
be six gigs so we should be looking at
the the full coup de coeur count so I've
installed driver version 4 16 . 16 which
is from October and I'll explain why I
did that a little bit later on but we're
gonna go ahead and fire up shadow of the
two raider we're running at 1920 by 1080
and at all hi except I turned off motion
blur because it's stupid so here we have
it average FPS 68 okay you can oh you
can see the specs of our testbench here
so this is kind of a best-case scenario
for the 1060 we've got a 9900 K in here
and our minimums were Oh
Wow oh yeah 56 okay that makes more
sense
so minimums of 56
that's very playable here comes the
Chinese mining card yeah isn't that a
great question you guys probably
couldn't hear that because Brandon was
like kind of mumbling come on over here
Brandon how are you going to plug it in
if it doesn't have bio so we're not
saying that this technique is gonna work
for everyone because if your motherboard
does not have graphics outputs and your
CPU doesn't have an eye GPU built into
it you will not be able to do this but
remember how we got free sync running
off of an Nvidia card before bypassing
the GPU power through the other card
that interfaced with the display well
with the modified driver the theory is
we'll be able to do the same thing here
not with free sync mind you but with the
performance of our graphics card being
passed through the output of our onboard
graphics this is a technology that
didn't really have any reason to exist
on desktops on their own but it's kind
of a carryover from laptops that have
onboard graphics that they run when
they're trying to save power and then
high-performance graphics that they
switch to in games so button because the
feature exists well we can take
advantage of it here so we're gonna go
ahead and install our 416 dot 16 drivers
at least we're going to try
is this supposed to work I didn't solve
that driver there's a different driver
that we need to install but if this
works then did it work if this works
then I'm a little confused I mean this
drivers theoretically already installed
on the system no okay so we do have a
problem it's showing up as P 106 100 in
device manager instead of GTX and 60
well let's go ahead and let's let's try
but this is not supposed to work so I
may have jumped the gun here yet like
yeah it's showing up as a P 106 but the
driver fully installed okay
Nvidia control panel is there but it's
in display settings that I would switch
to it correct
right under GPU or graphics graphic
settings down at the bottom there
graphics settings there we go okay so
let's browse for an app options here we
go high performance safe okay oh so it
doesn't pick up a P 106 as a high
performance GPU option well what happens
if we pop open the Nvidia control panel
here you are not currently using a
display attached to an NVIDIA GPU all
right
Anthony come on in here what do we need
to do okay and talk to the camera so
okay I'll move here oh that's just yep
okay okay okay okay what do I need to do
there's this little folder on the
desktop that you missed which is fine
because it's like in this honeycomb
pattern which is great it's called
mining
and in there is the actual driver we
need it is modified but if you try to
install that right now yeah chances are
it will error out okay so we need to
disable secure boot okay so that we have
to restart for now the benefit of secure
boot is theoretically that it prevents
malware from attacking your pre boot
environment is that about right yeah but
there's been an exploit on that so so
this is the boot options menu in the
advanced on the bias it's going to
change depending on what motherboard or
computer you have but long story short
we're gonna go into key management yeah
then we're going to go to is it clear
secure boot keys and it'll be like do
you really want delete them yeah we do
so now if we go out it's disabled I
remember the first time I encountered
this I was just absolutely furious
because it doesn't even register as a
change to the BIOS nothing like I was so
mad I was like what do you mean that's
how you disable it I don't want to
delete them forever necessarily like
it's not really a very clear terminology
anyway ya know and you can put them back
it's it's it's ridiculous anyway long
story short you can turn it off it's
perfectly fine you can put it back if
you want but we need to turn it off for
now okay now we're back in the
PowerShell we're gonna try that command
again so it's BC edit / hello / windows
still hasn't figured out how to not take
the focus away from a window that I'm
actively working on how is that even
possible it's very rude anyway / set
test signing on completed successfully
yay now we need to reboot what this
allows you to do is install drivers that
have not been signed so that means that
they may have been modified it might be
corrupted it might cause instability in
your system so it's not generally a good
idea but it is required in this case one
thing I am doing here is I'm going to
disable Windows Update and there's no
particular reason other than it annoys
me when it tries to reinstall the driver
so I'm just gonna go ahead and do that
you should probably turn it back on
afterwards if you're doing this
now you're gonna go to the vice manager
we're going to delete this driver that
we installed earlier yeah do we have to
DD you it or is that good enough I think
this is good enough we can DD you it
it's probably best practice to ddu it
but yellow anyway for those not familiar
DD you is a third party driver removal
utility that's actually freaking awesome
go check it out if you ever have a
stubborn driver issue and feel free to
throw some support those guys way
they've been at it for a very long time
it's a really useful tool I've used it
many many times here is so this is what
happens normally you would get an error
saying that the driver is corrupted or
modified or something like that but now
go ahead you can still explain it okay
but now what it came up with is this
software is unsigned so it just came up
with a warning because you're you've got
test signing mode on it means that
you're basically four window over all
windows knows a driver developer so
you're installing that driver anyway
again if you see that under normal
circumstances you should probably not do
that but it is required here do we have
any way of knowing that this driver is
not installing malware in the system no
okay yeah I haven't actually looked at
it so to be clear what we're doing here
we are actually not recommending that
you try it at home graphics drivers
installed so we'll just close that now
we want to do is look at this it still
looks like P 106 but if we go into
driver it'll say not digitally signed
here okay so that's what we expect
that's what we expect this is the not
signed driver it's running so now we go
into our display settings shadow the
Tomb Raider shadow the Tomb Raider
oh we might need a reboot yeah I came up
with the methodology here about two
hours ago
and when show started three minutes ago
oh that's what we're like 1,000% seat of
our pants right now
so we DD you'd at this time which it
turns out was probably a necessary step
and we're ready to go again so we're
going into here and there it is
high-performance GPU and vidya P 106 100
so let's make that the default and
shadow the Tomb Raider here we go
remember guys it's like after 70 US
dollars okay that's the important part
of this I'm so excited right now it's
worth remembering that this card was
basically destined for the recycling bin
exactly like it could not game there was
no possible way well could it be used
for compute other than game bar other
than mining yeah but it's a 1062 class
PP you so like it's not even worth the
PCI Express slot you put it in for that
kind of a thing yeah but here it is
maybe a new lease on life and just so
you guys know there's no there's no
smoke and mirrors here's our HDMI cable
there it is going into the bottom of our
monitor and directly into the back of
the motherboard there is nothing on this
card that is looking pretty good
actually
that might actually have been higher
than the superclone oh that is looking
real nice gaming on a graphics card with
no outlets feels good well we missed the
moment when it came up but that's fine
we've got our result and actually this
is as good as I would have expected so
we fell for FPS short in our averages
and then for our minimums we only fell 3
FPS short now you will see a slight
difference in performance when you're
running the compute or the the the
rendering of the game on one GPU and
then outputting it via another one and
this is pretty much consistent with what
I would expect from either that or the
difference in clock speed between a
super clocked and just a
regular 1060 cart so it worked yeah
pretty sweet but we are not saying at
all that we would recommend this so
Anthony there weren't really
instructions from the seller on Taobao
where did you end up getting the driver
you used shockingly enough from our
forum there are actually a lot of
different forum posts about this long
story short there was one person who
included a dock and a link to a Google
Drive folder with all the stuff we need
it which was great thank you very much
with all that said that is not a
recommendation for any of you to go
download that because there's no way of
knowing when you're installing an
unsigned driver if anything has been
changed other than the things that they
said they change unless you're qualified
to go through and examine exactly what
it is they changed in which case you
could just go and do it yourself so
right now there's really no path to
avoiding the scrap heap for these P 106
and if I recall correctly there were gtx
1070 equivalents as well yeah I think so
cards so really the onus is on Nvidia to
do something about it
because while I'm not expecting them to
run out and make this a supported use
case for any motherboard with onboard
video there's no reason that this
couldn't work if they weren't
specifically locking it out so I'm not
asking them to support it I'm just
asking them to not specifically disable
it because this is a serious waste
problem literally thousands tens of
thousands of these parts just useful for
absolutely nothing anymore when gamers
could be gaming on them now the next
stage is getting ourselves one of those
fancy solder alignment things that
rossmann has and putting like an HDMI
port on it I wonder if it would work
I can't think of any reason it wouldn't
like does it have the the actual chips
port
I'm sure there's I don't think these
guys modified their boards very much so
all that's left now is to thank
PIAA for sponsoring this video private
Internet access lets you use the
internet privately it allows you get
around government censorship access geo
locked content and even do things you
might not think of like save money on
flights so you can set your VPN to make
it seem like you're shopping for tickets
from somewhere else they've got tons of
great features they don't log user data
they've got servers and I forget how
many countries it is but it's like
hundreds or thousands of servers or
something like that whatever I'm sure
all these talking points are being shown
to you guys it's freaking awesome and
it's affordable so check out bia today
