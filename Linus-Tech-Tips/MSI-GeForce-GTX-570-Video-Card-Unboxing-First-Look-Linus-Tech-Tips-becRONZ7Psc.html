unboxing this is the MSI their take on
the GTX 570 from Nvidia so the first
thing you're gonna notice about the
front of their box is I don't know I
don't know what the first thing you're
gonna notice is but the first thing I
notice is this afterburner logo attached
to like a spaceship thing going on here
so after burner is MSI's overclocking
and tweaking software that is awesome
it's really good it's great you can
adjust voltages you can adjust clock
speeds you can set different
overclocking profiles you can make it so
that it sets everything up when you boot
into Windows it's really really good
anyway other things on the front of the
box we have a three year warranty and
Emma in MSI in the USA and Canada and
bear in mind that in Canada so this is
applicable to our Canadian viewers the
warranty is actually covered within
Canada so you don't have to ship to a
u.s. depot that's a pretty good
advantage because you don't have to pay
shipping across the border deal of
customs etc we have full support for
nvidia cuda sli physics as well as 3d
vision including 3d vision surround
although you will need two cards to run
3d vision surround and these specs are
pretty much the same as any other gtx
570 and that you've got 1.28 and
megabytes of video card memory we're
actually using the same GPU core as the
GTX 580 but it is slightly cut down so
we have fewer processing cores and a
lower memory bed with to go along with
the lower memory capacity so let's take
the card out for a second and then we're
going to have a look at what Emma sized
included in terms of accessories because
that's sort of part of their package as
an Nvidia add-in board partner as well
so the first thing we have is a quick
user guide next we have a driver disk
throw it away download the latest from
in videos website we have a mini DVI or
rather mini DVI mini HDMI to HDMI
adapter we have a DVI to VGA adapter
although please do yourself a favor and
get a DVI monitor if you're running a
video card of this caliber next we have
two molex to PCIe 6 pin adapters just in
case you do not have an
today power supply with PCIe connectors
in which case please get a new power
supply and next we have a little guide
on how to use their live update feature
alright let's get down to the graphics
part itself at the time of recording
this video MSI's gtx 570 also comes with
one additional free game that the other
gtx 570 s do not so it comes with with
all the usual stuff and then it comes
with a copy of metro 2033
it's not included in the box but you get
a coupon if you buy it from NCIX that
that includes a download steam version
of metro 2033 so that's a pretty cool
game DirectX 11 to run on your brand-new
DirectX 11 video card so here at the
back you can see there's not a whole lot
to speak of here at the top of the part
you will find an MSI logo you will also
find a GeForce logo as well as two PCIe
6 pin power connectors so that is two
6-pin rather than a 6 pin in an 8 pin
like on the GTX 580 here at the top of
the part covered by MSI's little
trademark blue cover things are 2 sli
connectors so that means we have full
support for 2-way SLI as well as 3-way
SLI using a 3-way SLI bridge and a
compatible motherboard alright here we
have a PCI Express 16x interface down
here at the bottom moving on to the back
we have what I would now consider to be
standard for an Nvidia 500 series card
we have two DVI ports one mini HDMI port
so remember that you can only use two of
these at a time that means you can
either use both DV is you can use a DVI
and HDMI and then a DVI and an HDMI you
can't use all three at the same time to
get Nvidia surround that is 3d vision
surround or just regular surround gaming
going on you actually have to have two
cards running in SLI mode and then you
hook up two monitors to one card and one
monitor to the second card and given how
much horsepower is required for three
monitor gaming I don't really feel
that's an unfair requirement on NVIDIA
sparked especially because you don't
have to have it
play port monitor you can run three HDMI
or DVI monitors okay here at the back of
the card there's not really a whole lot
and I think that pretty much covers
everything there is to say about the msi
gtx 570 so I know I haven't had a
performance review up yet but I will
have my usual slew of video content
around the gtx 570 coming for you guys
