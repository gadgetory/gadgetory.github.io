gigabyte p67
a UD 4 so the UD 4 in the last couple
generations of products tends to denote
the best bang for the buck board in
their lineup so this one features
unlocked performance meaning if you pair
it up with a case series processor you
will be able to unlock the performance
of that unlocked chip
it supports Intel core inside mind you
only in the LGA 1155 variation not LGA
1156 not LGA 1366 make sure if you're
buying this board you check what kind of
CPU you're buying it has the Intel P 67
chipset which means you've got support
for SLI crossfire as well as well
unlocked processors you have a three
year warranty in the US and Canada and
it features their two double thickness
copper PCB let's go ahead and move
around to the back and see what else
gigabyte has to say for themselves so
benefits of their 2x Popper PCB I'll let
you guys read that if you want but I'll
pull out a couple gems is got lower
temperature overall which increases
overclocking lower impedance so better
flow of power all of that good stuff
USB 3.0 is supported by this board
including their on/off charge feature
which enables you to see say for example
your iPhone enables you to charge your
iPhone even if your computer is powered
off you've got support for their USB
power 3x feature which I love I think
this is a great feature it allows you to
plug in three times the number of
peripherals to one USB port without
overloading the power so if you run a
USB hub or something like that then you
can plug in more power drawing devices
to a single port you've also got support
for state a three six gigabit per second
which is twice the speed of state of to
three gigabit per second all right we've
got a user's manual as well as a utility
DVD which you should not use you should
download the latest from the gigabyte
website we've got an appropriately
colored bright yellow warning in every
language under the Sun socket 1155 CPUs
only warning please please do not try to
plug in an 11 56 CPU we've got a Dolby
home theater sticker we've got a
multilingual
installation guide
as well as in color-coded IO shield and
four SATA cables to right angle and to
strength we have an SLI bridge no
crossfire bridge you'll find that with
your video card and then we have the
board itself and let me say I am the
biggest fan of Giga bytes new color
scheme on their performance boards I
love it I think this is like the best
thing they've done for their boards
since they made them awesome back in the
965 chipset days so let's start with
don't zoom it let's take in the whole
thing let's have the whole experience so
we've got a nice glossy finish on our
CPU socket beautiful matte black PCB I
haven't seen anyone other than XFX use
matte black PCBs
but now gigabyte is doing it look at
that there's no reflection off it
whatsoever
just gorgeous and then we've got a nice
matte gray color to the MOSFET coolers
as well as the tip set cooler and almost
every single connector and slot on this
board is black look at that black ape in
black Ram slots not even color coded I
love it forget color coding make it look
nice then the only thing that is color
coded is the SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
ports so now let's actually look at the
features of the board because I guess
that matters to some people this is our
LGA 1155 socket so you can put your core
i3 i5 or i7 CPU in there we have one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve plus two phase power
design on this particular board which is
pretty darn good for a like a mid-range
performance board our eight pin CPU
power connector is right where it
belongs in the top left corner of the
board and I really like I mean we showed
it already but here I'm gonna you get
kind of this angle here I really like
the overall look of their MOSFET coolers
now maybe not all that practical
practical but let's face it with these
high efficiency designs these days you
don't have to do much cooling on them
camera man's gotten away from me here
he's looking at the Northbridge cooler
which is also very stylized
similarly okay so we've got support for
up to four sticks of dual channel ddr3
memory and that is
of the cpu otherwise I'm sure they'd
find a way to put more sockets on there
our 24 pin power connector is in its
ideal location along the right-hand edge
of the board and as we move down we've
got their dual BIOS features so you have
a main BIOS and a backup BIOS and you
can actually use both of those so you
really reduce the chances of correcting
your motherboard completely and having
to army it because of a dead BIOS or
like a miss flash or anything like that
here we have our SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second ports as well as to say 2 to 3
gigabit per second parts these are all
running off of the Intel chipset we have
a clear CMOS jumper down here although
yep that is the only place for it clear
CMOS jumper we do not have any onboard
power switches although if you're
running your board in a case that's
usually not a concern here are your
front panel connectors your USB your
more USB your more USB and your serial
port should you so require there is no
firewire support on this board so here
we have our real what I think is really
an excellent slot layout we've got
support for two dual slot PCI Express
16x graphics cards and it would leave us
one two PCIe 1x and one PCI slot for
expansion and remember on p67 just like
p55 you I can either run in 16x mode on
a single slot or dual 8x mode on two
slots moving around to the back panel I
see what is a pretty satisfactory
looking layout I love these there's one
of your combo keyboard/mouse ps2 ports
you have one two three four five six
seven eight
USB 2.0 ports digital audio out is
supported in both pro axial and optical
flavours you have two eSATA ports two
USB 3.0 ports 1 Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1
audio out on the back of the board there
is nothing of note except that sexy
matte black PCB I mean this would look
good pretty much no matter what kind of
system you build around it love it
