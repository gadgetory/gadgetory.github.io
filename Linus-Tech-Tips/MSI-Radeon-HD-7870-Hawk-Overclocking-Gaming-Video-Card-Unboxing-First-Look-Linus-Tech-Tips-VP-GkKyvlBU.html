actually very exciting this is the MSI
Radeon 7870 Hawk now if you know
anything about msi hawk edition cards
you know basically that they are badass
because they build they just completely
over build these cards and they are
actually not that much more expensive
than a regular one now when you factor
in all so that the 7870 is already a
terrific value in a great overclocker
and Hawk Edition cards are all about
overclocking and not costing that much
more yes I am very excited about this
card so comes with a three-year warranty
and USA in Canada and Mexico
incidentally if you live in Vancouver
there's a local RMA Depot which is
really handy because you just go in and
you can basically like walk in instead
of shipping comes with GPU reactor ready
for 3d mark 11 which basically just
means it's DirectX 11 card military
class three concept once again I'm
talking about over building that's what
I mean MSI Afterburner up to 85% over
fucking okay well come on MSI
Afterburner softwares obviously included
in supported unlocked digital power so
this again comes into the over building
of card aspect of things here we go
there's a stealth fighter or bomber or
something breaking World Records with
unlock digital power digital okay so
unlock BIOS digital PWM controller and
has power design for best overclocking
stability as top solution on HD 7870
graphic card I believe it based on past
hawk card experience one click to unlock
all the protections including over
current protection disable active phase
switching higher catalyst control center
range and a higher power turn range
that's awesome remember guys power tune
keeps your your board within a certain
power threshold all reference boards
have it from both vendors these days for
the latest generation products these
these power throttles that are built
into the cards turn it off fantastic
great for overclockers digital pwm
controller so more stable and precise
voltage by a digital signal okay it has
power design you clipped with eight
phases for the GPU and two phases for
memory and one phase for VDC
military class three components
including copper MOSFETs highly
conductive capacitors gold and solid
state chokes I don't know that the gold
coating actually increases performance
but it looks cool dark solid capacitors
but the special coating for anti rust
protection interesting so I guess if
you're in a fairly humid environment
that would be a definite factor okay
three by three OC kits must-have
features for extreme overclockers VIII
checkpoints agreed 100% you can use a
multimeter to read the actual values
triple over voltage must again a total
must triple ten monitors able to monitor
the GPU memory and vrm awesome okay what
else we got in here Dooley at centimeter
pwm fence superpipe technology with
eight millimeter heat pipes dual form
and one heat sinks nickel plated copper
base propeller blade technology which in
theory gives you better air flow as well
as making dust less likely to accumulate
in the heatsink so the fan spin and
reverse on startup which removes the
dust before it actually starts cooling
which is very very cool and I've learned
to trust emphasize claims with respect
to thermal performance so they're
staying up to fifteen degrees cooler
than a reference and up to five decibels
quieter than a reference once you start
overclocking their twin pros our coolers
just destroy the reference coolers on
both the AMD and the Nvidia side so in
terms of included accessories we've got
a DVI to VGA adapter to dual molex to
6-pin PCI connectors as well as a mini
DP 2 full-size DisplayPort adapter we've
also got our V check point pieces so
these plug into the V tach points on the
card and these plug into your multi
limit monitor leads we have ok something
oh no way find the GPU reactor card and
have the obverse side of the card turn
upward as illustrated to check the
correct installation orientation note
we're going to find out more about this
GPU reactor so GPU reactor basically
increases the voltage stability and
reduces ripple to the GPU for an extreme
overclocking it is not required
for air or even water operation but if
you want to throw liquid nitrogen or dry
I accept the problem it's probably
recommended to use it we've got a driver
disc throw away that download latest off
the AMD website quick user guidance
certificate of quality and stability now
I've always kind of laughed at these
certificates that get included with cars
before because I actually didn't know
what steps get thrown into something
like military class three I actually
happened to have a slide deck over here
that includes all of the different tests
so there's temperature shock test which
is done in a chamber there's the rainy
day indoor humidity test vibration test
low pressure test high temperature test
low temperature test for liquid nitrogen
cooling dam and shock test that is where
the certificate of quality and stability
comes from now that's not to say that
they take the card and like drop it and
that's like that's like you know falling
down test no it's more to do with the
components that went into the cart than
the actual finished end-user product
itself and of course being a hawk
addition card it looks ballin out so
we've got dual eighty millimeter pwm
fans once again this is with their dust
reduction it's been the other way for a
little bit and then spin this way
technology the shroud is made of
aluminum looks very very nice we've got
a beast looking aluminum cooler so you
can see it stretches all the way from
here all the way past the back of the
end of the PCB so that is an enormous
amount of cooling surface area you can
see the super pipes here so these are
more like normal heat pipes one two
three the super pipes are at the ends
and the reason for that is you can see
the GPU right there all the heat pipes
are positioned directly over the GPU
itself and these ones are bigger because
they have to carry heat more efficiently
because they're going further away that
is what's going to make all of the area
that the fans cover cool the card as
effectively as possible so these super
pipes go into the thickest area of the
heatsink that is further away that is
right next to the fan so it's getting a
very significant amount of airflow now
the fans don't only cool the GPU itself
but because there's no barrier between
the fins themselves and the cart you can
see clearly that the there is a heat
spreader covering the
card and then all of that incidental
airflow is going to cool the PWM
components the RAM you can see the
thermal material that is between the
memory and the heat spreader itself you
can also see the gold-plated oh wow
those look so cool can you see that that
is awesome
it's like can you give me a nod or a nay
success yes splick says those are
amazing okay
just all that let's see I'm like I'm
like not letting you guys look at it cuz
like I'm trying to see them better
sorry moving on so cool okay moving on
to the back of the board here is the GPU
reactor thingamabob right here so it can
actually be removed warning be noted
that any improper installation of GPU
reactor card may cause damage to the
card so okay give me a sec here guys I'm
gonna try to forget how to do this sorry
I just had to press a little bit harder
so what's cool is you can actually turn
it either way so if you happen to have
like an upside down ATX case you could
like turn it the other way so that it's
still right-side up in the side
oh there's LEDs in here too so it's
gonna light up so this is the GPU
reactor board which as I mentioned
increases the stability see they can
only cram so many components on the back
of the GPU itself to have you know to
control the voltage that goes to the
various parts of the chip msi said no
not enough we need more so they built
this guy right here which plugs in so
you can I hope you guys can see that
plugs into those two slots you may want
to make sure you don't put it on wrong
because I'm sure that would deliver all
the wrong voltages everywhere and then
you cover it up with this thing
obviously this thing isn't necessarily
crossfire ready because it makes the
back of the card on top of the backplate
itself it bulges out a little bit more
so if you were a slot to slot then it
wouldn't really work that well but as
long as you're running a single card or
duel cards with lots of spacing that is
just awesome speaking of which there's a
backplate on the card itself so the
aesthetics of it are very very sleek
looking so you can see even the the heat
spreader here over the front of the card
the Unison comes
like this and just has like a very nice
look to it and the side logo on the top
this uses still uses dual 6 pin PCI
connectors remember this is a 28
nanometer GPU so it's not like it's even
in an extreme overclocking scenario
you're not going to run into the need
for more than dual six pins and I'm
personally not a huge believer that an 8
pin can deliver that much more power
than a 6 pin in a real-world scenario on
account of it's just two more ground
pins correct me if I'm wrong PCI Express
3.0 is of course included this is a new
generation card a 7000 series card so
that is a given although once again I'm
not 100% sure that the bandwidth
increases necessarily that significant
in a real-world scenario there's our v
checkpoints so you use those little
dongles right there you plug those all
in and then you can connect to whichever
ones you want to measure your true
voltages in real time so they're labeled
memory PLL and GPU memory PLL and GPU ok
let's have a look at the back of the
cards so it supports up to 4 displays
right out of the box 2 through DVI HDMI
and 2 through mini DisplayPort now if
you can daisy chain them I believe you
can support up to do something like 6
displays by doing two monitors per
display port but most monitors don't
have support for that functionality just
yet anyway support for prosperity' to
2-way configurations because there is
only one crossfire connector and I think
that pretty much covers it so it comes
clocked at one point one gigahertz so
even though it says gigahertz Edition on
the box or something like that what they
really mean is gigahertz and more
Edition this is a hot card it is pre
overclocked and comes with ample
Headroom for additional overclocking
