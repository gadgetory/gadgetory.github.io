through a be Auto Show thinking gee if
only I could Plasti Dip every part of my
computer like these modern-day Picasso's
have done to their cars but with all my
stuff even work anymore
and what about cooling well if that's
ever happened to you we've got the
answers
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description so to bring our
idea for the funkiest PC ever to
fruition we decided early on that
halfway wasn't going to be far enough we
resolved to Plasti Dip our entire
machine outside and in even critical
system components like the motherboard
video card and CPU heatsink
understandably we were a little
concerned that while Plasti Dip seems to
be a rubberized type of coating it is
therefore hopefully completely non
conductive it's not a feature that they
explicitly advertise so the chances that
this kind of a treatment could kill the
PC whether by gumming up the electrical
contacts or causing a short seemed
pretty high thankfully though our
friends over at the local electronics
refurbishing and recycling mega store
free geek came to the rescue
hooking us up with a fairly respectable
if several generations old machine that
if it survives will actually be able to
rock some pretty modern games along with
its new style so the first thing we did
was to validate that free gigs donor
hardware was in proper working order and
that the coolers were keeping our system
cool enough to avoid any thermal
throttling then we rolled out to
Canadian Tire
and drops 250 of whip what $250 did you
guys even try to contact Plasti Dip to
see if they'd sponsor it we did and why
do you think we bought it oh all right
then two hundred and fifty dollars so to
make sure then that the motherboard
wasn't harmed anymore but it was already
going to be we borrowed some dust covers
from an AC saber tooth port to fill our
PCI Express SATA RAM and i/o ports
wherever possible and filled in the gaps
with some tape much taping later we were
ready to go to town with the hot pink
which oh right
we were ready to go to town laying down
the initial white coat that's required
for optimal coverage no big deal I mean
engineering is pretty much trial and
error that's what that means right
moving on for the power supply we
couldn't just blast paid into it and
hope for the best we wouldn't get very
good coverage that way so we needed to
tape it off on the inside we took it
apart making sure that we didn't get
shocked by the very questionable TSU
that we picked out of the door soft
Bennett free geek and then to make our
task easier not less stupid
we hung what we could off of sawhorses
and got to painting enjoy this
psychedelic montage
so that at this point the internals were
all done up with a unicorn ate a rainbow
it didn't sit well and our PC gotten the
line of fire aesthetic and the cases
clean black Candice look was completed
but one thing was still missing the side
panel really needed a sweet design to
put a cherry on top of this build we
were originally thinking some sweet-ass
flames and Edie made us a stencil to cut
out but it was way too complicated and
Edie has shockingly poor taste in flames
so we decided instead that a cactus
would be not only cooler but also and
perhaps most importantly it would be
much easier and Wow goodness gracious
that is possibly the funkiest most
cosmic cactus that I have ever seen time
to slap everything together then and
then ourselves
you
it ended up looking even more fantastic
than we could have possibly hoped but
does the machine still work I mean that
is the point of this can you do this at
home
and it does from a certain point of view
we've got windows installed and fired up
I 264 to see how it was faring and oh
wow
just installing programs at around 20
percent load on our CPU landed us at 90
plus degrees Celsius on the processor
and under full load we thermal throttled
at a tropical 100 degrees Celsius but I
mean this is kind of what we were
expecting we could have easily not
painted the heatsink and it would
probably have been fine but that wasn't
really the point of the build the point
was to find out if Plasti Dip in your
computer hardware will kill it and the
answer is maybe because our success
doesn't guarantee yours synergy is an
easy software download that solves once
and for all the problem of having two
keyboards and two mice on your desk if
you have multiple pcs because it lets
you share one Mouse in one keyboard
between two or more computers seamlessly
so you'll no longer confuse which one
goes with which and they even allow
advanced features like clipboard sharing
between the computers being able to
drag-and-drop files between the
computers the ability to set up hotkeys
and support for multiple operating
systems Windows Mac even Linux we've got
basic and pro options and you can use
our link in the video description to get
50% off synergy today so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit the like button get subscribed
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there is a
