brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital
welcome to the EVGA suite where they've
got of course some graphics cards but
also some not graphics cards so we're
gonna start with the torque Mouse it's
available in a couple of different
configurations I'm holding the
carbon-fiber one which has carbon fibre
on the side versus there's a regular
more like plastic one it's got the usual
gaming grade features so you've got RGB
lighting that you can customise using
their software it's got you know side
buttons on either side so it's got an
ambidextrous design it uses an 8200 dpi
sensor but there's some other cool stuff
as well the top has a removable plate
there's no confirmation one way or the
other it looks like at launch it won't
be swappable for something else for a
custom look but what it does give us
access to is the weight system
underneath so you can add and remove
weights at will not as common of a
feature but something we've seen before
is is adjustability so you can use a
screw at the back and you can actually
adjust the back of the mouse or the butt
of it up a little bit higher a little
bit lower depending on what is most
comfortable for you there are of course
slippy pads on the bottom covering
almost the entire bottom of the surface
on the mouse overall is I'd say about an
average weight so once you added some
weight to it you could make it quite
hefty if that's what you prefer next up
we've got of course there's the GTX 780
Ti classified back there but no no no no
no the one we're gonna be focused on
here is the GTX 780 Ti classified
kingpin Edition so instead of a 12 phase
power design this one has a 14 phase
power design in addition to its
otherwise amazing sexiness it has three
bios's which are accessible using a bios
switch on the top of the board
it also has two eight pin and one six
pin power connector now to be clear guys
this card is not like a lot of products
you see where it's like okay yeah it's
got like two eight pin CPU connectors on
a motherboard but like realistically you
could never run that kind of power
through the socket this is actually
designed for hardcore liquid-nitrogen
overclocking quite frankly if you
just a regular user you aren't going to
benefit from it other than the extreme
bragging rights that come along with
owning a product like this it does
support their evbot you are their evbot
dongles so you can make adjustments to
the settings of the card on-the-fly even
when it is powered on and up at the top
you've got comprehensive voltage check
points that can be used to monitor
voltage using a multimeter if you don't
necessarily trust software or if you
want something that you can monitor even
when you don't have your software fired
up it uses a dual fan design and yes
that clear shroud is the final design so
the king pin Edition will have a very
different look than the normal 780ti
classified and personally I am waiting
for someone to figure out a way to get
some crazy custom LED lighting going on
on this a very unusual looking ACX
cooler from EVGA it's got the usual
output so dual DVI HDMI and DisplayPort
and of course it is a non-standard
length non-standard height non-standard
card in every possible way
designed to squeeze the last bit of
possible performance out of the GTX 780
Ti GPU now speaking of squeezing the
last bit of possible performance Nvidia
green light has limited in many ways
what board partners can do in terms of
allowing their customers to overclock
the cards balls to the walls and EVGA
hasn't quite figured out what they're
gonna do yet but they will find a way
somehow to make this card unfettered so
you're not going to be limited by those
pesky power limits and things that just
cause the card to shut down in the
middle of everything so I'm excited to
see where they're going with this and
now we're here with the hadron hydro now
we actually didn't a review of the
Hadron air not that long ago and what we
liked about it was it was extremely
compact it has a 500 watt power supply
it is capable of holding a GTX 780 780
Ti or GTX Titan in it and it is a micro
ATX case that actually once you build in
it doesn't have bad cable management you
got to be a little bit careful you got
to kind of tuck things away but when
you're working with extremely small
enclosures that can house extremely
powerful hardware that's just kind of
something you have to deal with now the
hydro adds a little bit of extra height
but it is otherwise basically the same
case that extra height is being put to
very good use and instead of to 120
millimeter fan
the top we're getting two fans and a 240
millimeter radiator now you can put your
own water cooling stuff in but EVGA also
has an option for you to buy their water
kit for somewhere in the sort of 170 to
200 dollar range I'm not sure if it's a
hundred percent finalized yet but that
kid is actually fairly reasonably priced
it comes with the CPU block one I've
never seen before but I mean it even the
worst CPU block these days is probably
only gonna be five six degrees better or
worse than you know the best one so it
comes with a CPU block it comes with a
pump and reservoir it comes with a
radiator it comes with tubing and
fittings including these special
fittings at the back that are that our
hard fittings just refer a better
aesthetic as well as less risk of damage
or catching them on something and
finally it comes with enough extra
tubing and fittings for you to plumb in
your own graphics card after the fact
using whatever water cooling solution
you want for that guys don't miss any of
our CES 2014 coverage thank you very
much for checking out this video from
EVGA sweet
remember our sponsors here at the show
are in CI x.com your source for great
technology selection and service and of
course course our memory and Western
Digital without those guys we wouldn't
have been able to be here so thanks a
lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
