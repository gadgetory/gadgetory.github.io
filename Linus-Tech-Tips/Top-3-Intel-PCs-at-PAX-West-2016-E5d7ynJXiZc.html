got the extreme rig challenge
competitors showing off their extreme
rigs this must be the first video I'm
doing at the show cuz I clearly haven't
lost my voice yet we're gonna highlight
the top three for you guys starting with
this little beauty from Origin PC behind
me so in terms of hardware specs it's
got a core i7 69 50 X I mean big
surprise we're in the Intel booth what
else were they going to put in there
it's got a rampage 510 Edition 10th
anniversary rog board it's got 32 gigs
of ram dual 1080 s I mean I guess they
could have had more RAM and they could
have had Titan X's but the budget for
the suit cool paint job had to come from
somewhere I guess and other than that
well we can't see a whole lot through
the window on this side but wait what
about the window on this side what the
hell is that they put another computer
in there so they've got a 6700 K they've
got a Maximus whatever if I think it's
eight whatever generation were on gene
they've got another 16 gigs of ram and
they've got a couple of elgato hd60 pro
capture cards as well as an Intel 750
series SSD yes my friends this in the
same size as a regular tower case has
two computers and they made some really
cool modifications to make this happen
so for one thing they had to completely
change up the back panel of the case
second in order to run two separate
water cooling systems each with their
own radiator in the basement they had to
actually modify a bay reservoir to have
a partition down the middle so that they
could run them completely separately
they had to build this entire system in
a low-profile manner and they had to do
it beautifully because this is the
extreme rig challenge
so those HD 60 pros are actually using
PCI Express risers that they're hiding
with this Origin PC logo that's custom
done in acrylic and the same goes for
this Intel 750 series SSD now in terms
of the rest of the storage this is
pretty cool
they've actually got two separate hot
swap bays one for the gaming system one
for the capture system so the idea
behind the system is if you're a
professional
Reimer do you have all the gaming pc and
all the capture pc you could possibly
need in a single tower oh and it has RGB
lighting alright next up we've got a
system from cyber power here that's
targeting the people who think their PC
needs like hydraulic you know bouncy
suspension am i right
yeah man yeah so this is the cyber power
PC luck series it features an Intel Core
i7 69 50 X Extreme Edition surprise
surprise 64 gigs of ram dual GTX 1080s
in sli gigabytes new design err series
x99 motherboard and of course the end
win' a chat our case the only case on
the planet and maybe it's for a good
reason that can do this it closes it
opens it slices it dices and you guys
might be sitting there wondering well
what did they actually do cuz that's
just an off-the-shelf case well they
added LED lighting effects and they
water cooled it and even cooler than
that and even though quite frankly this
is not a nice thing to say but quite
frankly it's kind of short Allah done
they've got freaking light tape in here
I have never seen that in a PC mod and I
really like the direction they're going
with it now the cuts we're pretty much
done by hand with like pencil marks to
line them up as far as I can tell but
with the CNC they figure they could do
it pretty cleanly and it's got this
really neat subtle gloww effect like you
might see in like an exit strip on an
airplane or a theater you actually can't
tell from the lighting in the booth
until I turn it off that it's
illuminated pretty freakin cool right
they've also got a custom vinyl wrap
around it as well as you know when I was
kind of giving them a hard time about
not doing anything it's a really
tasteful hard line water cooling job
that they've done in here so I check
them out
remember these are all entries in the
extreme ring challenge or at least these
two were the next ones not our last
system actually isn't part of the
extreme rig challenge but this thing is
so freakin cool I can't look away from
it it's got a I don't know probably a 69
50 AK so it looks like probably 64 gigs
and some kind of memory it's got a nice
ooze tough series white motherboard some
cool water cooling iBUYPOWER built it
apparently or we're not sure because the
sticker keeps coming off so I'm not
going to stress out too much about that
it's an NZXT phantom case it's got some
Asus graphics card in it with a mirror
on the back so looks really cool and
finally there's an intel SSD in the
bottom but no no no no this is so cool
this is the coolest side panel window I
have ever seen let me look at that like
Antwan effect I was like how did they do
this when I first came over and I saw
this and I saw this Lake I thought it
was like a tube of like black ink and
there was like water in there or some
 no it turns out this is actually a
transparent display that costs about
$1,000 from some company in China
no one could actually tell me where it
was where it was actually from and it
runs as a third monitor on this computer
so this is actually a video that's
playing I don't know the specs of it
because I can't look up the some company
from China website thank you everyone
for helping me out here but it looks to
be about a 1280 by 1024 kind of
resolution like it looks pretty darn
good as long as you don't get too close
to it and just to and this this blew my
mind it is not black and white which I
tested by putting this tasteful color
picture on it see look look at this
look at that guy I mean if you could
have a side panel that you could put
that picture on wouldn't you I sure
would
so thanks for checking out our top three
rigs here at the Intel booth at PAX West
20 whatever year it is don't forget to
check out the rest of our pax content
we're gonna have a playlist for it
somewhere in our playlists which are
linked in whatever direction I don't
know YouTube changes are doing
constantly why do I even bother see you
guys next time
