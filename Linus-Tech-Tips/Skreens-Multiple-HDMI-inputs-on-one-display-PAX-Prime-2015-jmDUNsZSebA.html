2015 this year check out their cloud to
gaming headset in the video description
down below also thank you to a soos and
Corsair alright guys we're here at
screens a little booth in the corner
that I almost walked past and didn't
really notice but they have some really
cool stuff what they have it doesn't
really have a name yet but there's a two
and four port version and it's basically
a multi HDMI in configuration device
that's what I'm gonna call it for now I
don't really know what to call it so the
two port you're gonna notice actually
has three ports on it that's because
there's two HDMI IN and one HDMI out the
four port has five ports on it
four HDMI IN one HDMI out and you can
daisy-chain all these together so to
explain the use case for this at least
for me is streaming mainly so the idea
would be when I was doing the 3d
printing stream if any of you guys saw
that basically I had to use two Logitech
c920 s cuz I only had one potential HDMI
IN so I used two webcams this would have
allowed me to use multiple actual full
like HDMI out cameras to actually record
too so I could use better quality stuff
for streaming and whatnot so if I had a
whole bunch of different inputs I can
mix them into one and it does that
through an app that works on Android or
iOS and eventually potentially other
things you can connect to it through
bluetooth through Wi-Fi or even through
an Ethernet jack because it has dual USB
ports you can plug in a USB to Ethernet
ejector and give this thing Ethernet it
runs screens OS so whatever that means
that's their own stuff and all the
configuration tools for iOS and Android
there's a bunch of different options so
you can control your layout you can add
different elements you can add a set
background color you can add widgets
like say Twitter so if you want to have
your your game stream and then have a
Twitter overlay on the side you could do
that there's transparency and
overlapping controls
there's quick layout switching buttons
so on the bottom there's a bunch of
layout switching buttons soon there's
going to be api's for OBS and xsplit so
that you can actually change your
configuration of your screens device in
the software instead of doing it on the
iOS or
Android app if you want to go that way
and it should eventually become
Universal streaming remote through say
the iOS app or the Android app because
you should be able to configure so many
things inside of that time to talk about
some hardware stuff jumping back to that
daisy chaining thing I talked about
earlier we're not sure an exact maximum
how many things you can daisy chain
together but it will add one frame time
per so I have a little bit of latency as
you do it but that being said I'm not
sure how many of you guys out there
would need more than say the four port
version but we'll see you might you
might you might find a way to use it I'm
not gonna put that word in your mouth
anyways there's custom silicon inside it
can take up to 1080p 60fps signals and
it outputs a 1080p 60fps signal so yes
master race you don't have to worry
about losing your precious frame rates
they will be fine each model like I said
has dual USB ports and one power plug
and then its respective amount of HDMI
connectors and if you're interested you
should check out their website it's
greens.com
you can sign up on an emailing list
there and they'll send you an email 24
hours before their Kickstarter goes live
so yeah that 4 port version that I
mentioned isn't necessarily available
yet just the 2 port version they're
gonna run a Kickstarter they have it
here however it's already designed it
already works the kickstart is more just
for like awareness and sales and
marketing and whatnot thanks again to
