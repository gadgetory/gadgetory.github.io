2016 is brought to you by the Corsair
lapdog the gaming center that allows you
to use a full-size keyboard and mouse
from your couch and by MSI so we're here
in the corsair booth and they're showing
off this is like unbelievable I didn't
even know these guys make memory anymore
I mean it's like keyboards this and like
cases that and guys like George coming
in and going we should do cases power
supplies and cooling well no no no this
is a back to the roots product this
right here is the Dominator platinum
special edition ddr4 kit
well kits there are actually two of them
there's like a dark plated one and a
light plated one and the Vengeance LED
so I'm going to start with the Vengeance
LED since that's the one that may
actually have some relevance to more
than a handful of you they've taken
their vengeance ID which is kind of that
sort of sexy Corsair logo in the middle
and then accents on the outsides and
they've added LEDs to them they're going
to be available in two different colors
red and white to start and they support
a couple of different LED lighting modes
so you can see here they're not our GB
so they don't cycle colors but they're
able to kind of breathe and turn on and
off and stuff like that the software is
very very beta right now but it's going
to be controllable through corsair link
and i guess that's pretty much all there
is to say about it there are dual
channel kits and quad channel kits
available all the way up to frequencies
as high as forty three hundred megahertz
now let's get on to the special edition
now hate it when companies do a special
edition that's basically just SE and
there's no sort of limited quantity
because you know what the SE stands for
in those cases like well you know what
the S is for in addition okay it's
usually just like we need to sell this
thing um what can we put on the box se
terrible so no these are going to be
limited to 500 units each only 500 units
will be available they will be
individually numbered and these are a
Dominator platinum LED lit memory kit so
there's going to be a four by eight for
the quad channel enthuse
yes and a two by sixteen for guys
running on the z170 platform and they
are running at ddr4 3200 now no one in
the booth can confirm or deny this for
me but I would speculate that if they
were doing a hand-picked 500 unit run
that 3200 probably isn't the max that
you could expect these to run at and
they are going to look absolutely sick
in your system which as you guys
probably know is pretty much how I shop
for memory these days now this this is
cool this is the MSI slash Corsair
Seahawk GTX 1080
now they did a 980 TI before so this
isn't an entirely new concept Corsair
working on the cooler MSI working on the
GPU itself and slapping all that
together for a cool quiet maximum
overclocking gaming experience but the
big difference this time is that even
though this product is kind of hiding in
a corner in the booth because they don't
have a finalized PCB layout they don't
have finalized clock speeds I mean I
wouldn't even be surprised if the
backplate graphic design isn't even
finalized they are claiming that instead
of being nine months late this time they
are going to be two weeks after the
general availability of GT X 1080
graphics cards and ready to start
selling this puppy so thanks to the
single 120 millimeter radiator and 120
millimeter fan Corsair saying look we
are removing all the thermal limitations
and while in video was showing off clock
speeds like 2 gigahertz at their launch
event some folks on water are seeing
significantly higher than that so thanks
again to Corsair as well as to msi oh
actually that's funny look at that this
product is made collaboratively by both
of our sponsors for the show this year
for bringing us to Computex Corsairs big
thing they want me to draw your
attention to is the lap dog that couch
mechanical keyboard fold mouse pad
gaming experience and for MSI they want
me to be chatting you guys up about the
aegis at
so that is their new desktop as well as
their new GT X 1080 gaming X so that's
obviously a gtx 1080 although personally
I think this one's cooler but whatever
don't miss any Linus tech tips Computex
coverage by making sure you're
subscribed and I will see you guys at
the next booth</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
