is like the third set in the last two
months month two months are you counting
the between tooth burns kind of yes yeah
definitely yeah so forth whose cases we
had the original set yeah then we had
between two ferns temporary we had
between two ferns deluxe but I don't
think that necessarily counts because it
was like between six ferns and then we
had like the we're in a corner and it's
weird and then now we're here it was
like the attacked linked sideshow yeah
like yeah tech dinked get out of here
relegated to the corner now dedicated
hex wall yeah this is blue this is the
new set the the orange chair is a little
clashing though the white and gray chair
works pretty well maybe we'll try to
swap that one out who knows it'll
probably never happened doesn't matter
this is the new set welcome to the new
nah man Chet Chet bizarro world yeah
it's weird
it's it's also very weird because we've
had the land show in the other corner of
the office near where the workshop is
for the longest time not the entire time
that we've been here
because when show was technically like
in some weird spare room for a little
while and all this kind of stuff but for
many years it's been in the same corner
facing the exact same direction and now
we are like almost as far away as
possible
hmm from that point at the complete
other side of the aisle she'll be
quieter over here it should be a lot
quieter and I think the sound absorption
stuff in general should be a lot better
we'll have to I wonder what the twitch
chat is saying let's do a straw poll
actually I'm gonna set up a straw poll
straw poll topped me I want to ask
people whether it's like thumbs up or
thumbs down for this set versus the
other set all right you prefer the old
area do you like the new area a new set
better worse worse wait third option
idgaf I don't care
yeah whoa
I don't care fatso hey I resent that
okay what the heck what just happened
you know refresh what is that
there we go all right I want to see what
twitch chat has to say there we go I
missed the old set I expected that I
expected a lot of people were gonna
bring that up we fear change yeah a lot
of people do for your change in general
what do you think good new set old set
which one strumming you with some other
light I think it looks mostly okay no
yeah yeah yeah get out of there
blocking on Spooner later okay see way
to go at it it's like you work around
cameras some people just aren't camera
where you know so we got lots of sweet
wait are you still talking about
strawpoll I am okay here we go
got nothing never mind made it so a lot
of people don't care majority people if
they care think it's worse but that's
not super surprising because again
people fear change we're gonna ask you
next week when I ask you next week again
we're gonna maybe keep this poll going
also the lighting is like really not
perfect yet but we'll see how it goes
I'm interested in what people think I
think it should be darker Oh
mood lighting yeah get some candles yeah
the flickering yeah that Philips you
tech candle okay but now on to the
actual show what do we have lots of
sweet topics tons of talking we finally
found out for sure what happened in the
unfortunate uber accident from March
where that woman was killed you know we
also now know that Apple knew that the
iPhone 6 would Bend they knew it was
gonna bend before it launched now we
know that that's sick that is actually
pretty interesting also Nintendo bans
all online access to switch devices
owned by hackers this is on a account
basis we'll talk more about that later
and there has already been
GDP our complaints made against Google
and Facebook in the least surprising
news ever this is the deadline day for
GDP our so you should stop getting mass
emails about it pretty soon here I'm
sure you got willing saved a lot by the
way we're updating our privacy policy I
didn't even know I subscribed to you
unsubscribe
I did a thing with the forum which is
it's gonna annoy some people for
suresies but instead of emailing
everyone and yeah so the next time you
go login yeah it's just like hey I saw
that and I confused my first was a guy
typed the wrong thing in and I load it
again it's like I'm gonna have to scroll
down see my problem is I did the same
thing so I think a lot of people here do
pretty confused you go scroll down and
click the agree button sorry about that
probably intro a little confusing let's
press the button let's go oh really oh
yeah oh it's a beautiful Lagoon hold on
never leave
hold on how do I I can't just yeah okay
what's wrong will that do something yes
yeah that will give you swamp but yeah
thanks Edie
killing me other than the intro maybe
that's why I left
savage jerky savage just like Edie Moss
backpack the black pack yeah and then
buddy got a gaming keyboard hey we're
back
I'm happy that I fixed the fix of the
intro I wonder if that's the only time
that it's been broken and then came back
to life eventually a new intro for a new
beginning speaking I was that doing the
the reddening he's messing with the
light whatever keep keep it going
speaking of not new beginnings old old
old happenings what just happened you
may remember what have you done don't
you
can I keep going yeah travel back in
time to September 2014 when the iPhone 6
came out and an unbox therapy was like
biggest video of all time drop ok I mean
it yes yeah so there was a bunch of
viral content of videos and pictures of
people with like look at my night a nice
new shiny iPhone all bent to the shape
of my legs my hipster jeans are so tight
and then all the iPhone haters like me
were like and then like they they don't
always design things good it's a brick
it does bent and then Apple basically
said like this isn't a design flaw it's
designed good it's just there's like
some bad apples out there you know we've
got a million of these things get it but
now information contained in internal
Apple documents filed under seal in a
class-action lawsuit show that Apple
knew that the iPhone 6 and 6-plus were
susceptible to bending prior to the
phone's launch the company found in an
internal investigation that the iPhone 6
is three point three repeating of course
times more likely to bend than the
iPhone 5s and not surprisingly the 6
plus is 7.2 times more likely to bend
than the iPhone 5s that's kind of a
weird statistic as like the big ones
more likely to bend then the small one
no no kidding yeah yeah I was gonna say
so then the phone launched and everyone
found out there
and I was bad and then in early 2016
many iPhone 6 and 6-plus devices start
to exhibit symptoms of what's called
touch disease so you would get like a
flickering gray bar at the top your
screen or your your screen to be working
only intermittently or not at all yeah
and then it was determined by various
third-party repair people that that was
happening because the the integrated
circuit responsible for transiting that
touches to code was getting lifted off
of the board because your phone got bent
so then the chip would get lifted off a
little bit so then people started
complaining about that and Apple didn't
say anything they didn't confirm that
but they quietly started to put what
they call under fill' underneath the
chip so that future phones that got
shipped would actually be stronger but
they didn't say that to the public they
did not publicly acknowledge touch
disease until November 2016 even though
it was May of that year that they
started fixing all of the chips and they
only acknowledged it in November at
because there was like widespread news
reports about the issue and that thought
that's time they said that they were
gonna start replacing touched diseased
phones for a mere 150 dollars and that
had previously been a $350 charge and in
it is public announcement when they said
they're gonna do all this they didn't
actually say that they changed that they
started fixing them yeah they didn't say
that yeah they just said they're gonna
replace the touch disease ones yeah it's
like I can't say I'm surprised but it is
really interesting news it's probably
gonna hurt some at least some amount of
the Apple fanboys and but the Apple
fanboys and hasn't been doing very well
over the last few well that's the thing
it's just an another episode in a series
of trust betrayals over the last while
whether that's iOS rollouts that had all
these bugs or whether it's what else did
they do naming schemes for
well yeah the ten came out and while a
lot of people do like it there's a huge
amount of issues with it taking away the
headphone jack pissed a lot of people
off big one
including loyal fans like like they that
I I know this is coming from a PC fan
and like an Android fan but I feel like
sentiment really isn't there lately
like back when I used to work in a
computer store there was like you'd have
the Mac people come in and they were a
really hardcore and I worked with people
that were there that were Mac fans and
they were really hardcore and it was
kind of hard to debate because it came
down to both sides were giving logical
arguments it just was that one side put
more weight on one thing yeah the other
side put more weight on a different
thing sure so that made it so they were
like different things it was fine it was
an interesting battle now it's kind of
getting a little worse because the stuff
that they used to trash on like like PC
stuff or Android stuff for is starting
to happen on their side as well and then
I think that Google's closing the gap
now that we have a to like ship device
that kind of represents Android being
the Google pixel then it's kind of
easier although Apple's still ahead in
that and this we're talking about phones
here the let's acknowledge as a Windows
user windows sucks I'm like this close
as a switching to Mac what what version
of Windows do you run I don't think I
have the spring creators update on my
hand oh yeah hmm yeah that might be why
I shouldn't have to use like 2004
software I know to get a good exposure
soon like like 2018 stuff should be the
best stuff if you can make it work
without being a pirate you can get the
the embedded systems Windows 10 version
yeah far better or I would recommend the
same situation embedded systems but you
don't have to be a pirate to get it
windows 8.1 it's just a lot better yeah
it's one of my favorite things is when
you're like hey I want to disable
Windows Update and they're like or no
it's like what that's not how a computer
supposed to work anyways I think we're
probably good for that topic oh there's
more
things about hey so that in a court
filing in the class action case apples
lawyers wrote that it's rigorous and
comprehensive reliability test data
proved that enclosure bending and
twisting cannot cause the the touch
disease issue unless the phone had
already been repeatedly dropped on a
hard surface and I think that's so
interesting because what what it says to
me is like look we made a design choice
but that choice like sure it might cause
bending but it's that choice is not
gonna brick your phone and cause this
touch disease unless you already screwed
up by dropping it a bunch it harkens
back to it I believe it was the iPhone
for circa 2010 where you're holding it
wrong is that well I don't know it was
they couldn't get good quality because
there was a band of aluminum around the
outside so calls were dropping and their
official response was making phones is
hard we're really good at it
but no one could make a real phone
that's perfect so we're still the best
it's just phones are hard so the one
thing what they're doing and they need
to do this is they need to continue to
promote this and propagate this this
like fiction that we all buy into where
Apple has superior engineering as soon
as that myth or roads then what do they
have yeah so I think this is very own
brand for the lawyers to have this this
statement that stance yeah that makes
sense moving on to a hard topic now it's
it's something that's difficult to
approach in general and people have
talked about it people have mentioned it
in in which town already asking why it
wasn't like the first topic it wasn't
the first topic because I just didn't
necessarily think we would lead with
this I want to bring something slightly
more upbeat to the table we have had
this man on the wine show in the past he
was one of our guests quite a long time
ago when we used to bring a lot more
guests on but John totalbiscuit Bain has
passed away he has succumbed to a four
year battle with cancer
he's just 33 years old in the in the
notes but I'm gonna go off notes is
talking about how he contributed a lot
to gaming as a whole he was really big
into the Starcraft 2 scene his his
YouTube channel was pretty massive in
terms of reviews if you're in the PC
gaming community you probably know of
him you've probably seen one of his game
reviews especially indie games
especially indie games that was very
cool because I really liked indie games
for a long time
the very few people in the audience
might remember this but I used to have
any game reviews from pax they got like
no views compared to the rest of our
content so I stopped but still his wife
Jenna is is still around and has stated
that she's going to continue the co-op
tional podcast as well as her own
YouTube channel so if you want more of
that flavor of content be sure to tune
in and unless you have something to say
I don't I don't think I'm gonna keep
going
if if you if you want check them out the
the YouTube channel still there is
Twitter still there you can still watch
all those old reviews of indie games if
you want to check different things out
and if you did that if you consume that
content today you'd still be supporting
those who survived him like his like his
wife Jen okay that's for example check
out her YouTube channel keep watching
co-op tional podcasts do all that kind
of stuff yeah rest in peace John rest in
peace John and moving on because I don't
want no possible segue literally no no
possible segue now No so here's a story
that we reported on when it first broke
in March the the accident that happened
in Arizona with it's a self driving uber
that again this is actually also kind of
dark it was the first pedestrian death
in a self-driving car case so there's
there's been a report published by the
National Transportation Safety Board it
has all the details of what happened
what parts of the cars systems failed
the human error the software all of it
we know now finally so there's really a
complete by play in the report which
you'll be able to click through its
source number three if you get access to
the wound dot doc or if you go to the
ARS article that Luke has on the screen
you'll be able to click through as well
from the first paragraph this land dock
will be available on the forum after the
show by the way and this was posted on
the forum by the way by Sparta man 64
thank you so for those who don't know
there was a self-driving Ober cruising
down a I believe it's there's two lanes
it's at night there's two left turning
lanes and then there's a bike lane on
the right and basically it's nighttime
and a woman crosses the street not at a
crosswalk which is pretty much
irrelevant walking her bicycle and the
car strikes the woman and she eventually
died because of her injury injuries
there's also a dashcam footage that was
released that shows what the car is
heading towards and also inside the car
and the view inside of the car you can
see an uber employee who's supposed to
be responsible for taking over in tricky
circumstances who appears to be looking
down possibly at a smartphone and no one
knew if this person was being a
negligent or what but now we have more
details so this is just crazy
so what apparently what happened was
shortly after this story broke we
learned that the there was a statement
from the producers of the lidar systems
that they believed that they had checked
and that their systems had performed
properly and the report confirms that so
what happened was as the vehicle
approached I believe her name was Elaine
at first the vehicle detected just an
object this is at 6 seconds away from
collision then as gets closer it is
decided ok that's a vehicle and then
finally that's a bicycle but here's the
problem
hold on at one point three seconds
before impact the self-driving system
determined that an emergency braking
maneuver was needed to mitigate a
collision according to her emergency
braking maneuvers are not enabled while
the car is under computer control to
reduce the potential for an erratic
vehicle behavior so the car sees that oh
this is going to be crazy it's gonna
need some tricky steering too for us to
avoid this I'm not allowed to do that
the driver has to do that so I should
probably notify the driver
there are no alerts set up the system is
not designed to alert the operator wait
it gets worse so then you're thinking
okay so but if there's someone in the
driver's seat he's just gonna say this
is still a problem because the car
shouldn't have to alert the driver they
should be paying attention well it still
should alert the driver because you
could be yes but it shouldn't have to it
shouldn't have to it should like okay no
it should have to sorry but it the the
problem should have still been solved
right so you should presumably the
person sitting the driver's seat they're
saying they're thinking oh this looks
weird I should take over yeah but you
would still like to see like you might
be thinking when is this a situation
when the car's gonna do it or not it'd
be nice if the car was like maybe being
and then you're like yeah okay I'm gonna
take over but it gets worse because the
driver is actually responsible for
monitoring diagnostic messages that
appear on an interface in the center
stack of the vehicle - OH events of
interest for subsequent review that's
what she's looking at Oh
looking down not at her phone I mean
this is bit as per her statement she did
have a personal and a business phone in
the car
but she claims she was actually just
looking at the interface that she is
supposed to be looking at yeah so now
you've got a situation where hoover's
paying drivers to sit in the car and
look at it and not look at the road
basically and then the car's not gonna
go ding ding ding lookup and then it
plows into a pedestrian causing that
person's death she's like you should
have seen that coming
that is silly designers that's like
negligent that's a bad system presumably
when these when the engineers are
working on this system they would be you
would pay most attention to this kind of
case this isn't like an edge case this
is the critical what could happen case
your takeover driver is constantly not
looking at the road that's not that
can't work that way you could even like
it's it's you said something along lines
of like oh they have to make note of
different events and stuff like that I
feel like you could just have a log
where you have some form of like
controller that's on the steering wheel
well you're like this type of event just
happened this type of event just
happened just keep constantly keep notes
and then fill it out later
at the very Rosen stuff at the very
least and years ago ding-ding-ding had
just looking down yeah
just crazy so now after that accident
happened uber suspended its self-driving
testing in lots of different places and
HUD would work somewhat yeah someone
just said a HUD would work yeah you
could have something on the freakin yeah
I feel like the drivers should
definitely be able to be looking up the
fact that they have to look down is
really stupid there's got to be some
whether it's a simplified controller or
it's one of those like dial things that
are super popular in cars so that they
can at least still be looking up and
just have it post up onto the windshield
sorry continue
just the upshot is that uber has now
pulled itself driving program out of
Arizona laying off 300 people and as far
as I could tell I think that all of its
self-driving operations now are
happening out of its Advanced Technology
Center in Pittsburgh like its own
compound compound or campus and no
longer in test cities okay so that's
gonna hurt yeah probably I think one of
the biggest one of the biggest things
that's gonna hold back automated driving
and automated almost anything is
companies being careless with it and
having stupid things like this happen
and I hope that the companies that
aren't being careless with it and this
isn't me Elon Musk trumping there's
definitely more than one keep pushing
forward
I guess well almost every high-profile
company has had some kind of story about
this weather oh yeah a slower way MO and
there's have been a bunch with Tesla -
yeah it's yeah it's a fine line though
because they're all trying to push to be
first to market there's gonna be a huge
first mover advantage and there's
something to consider that is like there
will always be some amount of failure
rate and it's comparing that failure
rate versus the failure rate of human
drivers and as long as we're beating
that then good but like I it needs to
every single time that it does happen
because it's an automated system we can
go in and look at what happened with
with a human driver it's much harder
yeah it's much much much harsher and you
really have a camera looking in the
vehicle at the drivers you can't tell
you can actually diagnose these problems
and yes
ideally solve them every iteration
should be improved or
yes yes exactly so not necessarily even
solve it but like make it less likely to
happen at the very least and that's on a
system level yeah like if you get into
an accident you may never repeat that
mistake again
but that doesn't affect how I dress
doesn't improve humanity Yeah right but
it's kind of like cars versus airplanes
you know people feel unsafe on airplanes
you have another much safer but it's
about control you don't control the
plane that's fair a lot of the time they
like okay so I've always found it that
you brought up the cars versus airplanes
thing I've always found it interesting
that it ones like Oh have a safe flight
have a safe flight have a seat so can
try but then like if you jump in like a
taxi or they send you away in an uber or
something like I got here like yeah it's
true people do say drive safe
I just think it's like the like have a
safe flight thing is like a like a
guaranteed yeah I don't and what are you
gonna do about it yeah what is it I'll
put my seatbelt on yeah I will listen to
that demonstration do you I'll put that
mask on before I put it on my kid that's
the extent of safe flight that I can
guarantee you where's where's your
floatation device underneath my seat
well they're usually nice sometimes it
is the seat cushion itself I like when
they have that little straw in the oh
the little website they pretend to blow
on it oh yeah if it doesn't inflate
itself you can manually inflate your
your thing have you ever flown with Air
France no they have a video it's but in
the pre-flight check thing plays as a
video and the video is like the people
demonstrating are 5 Victoria Secrets
models and they're all being really cute
and funny and it's very effective at
getting your attention that's actually
pretty funny that's a that's a I mean if
it makes if it makes more people watch
like you know maybe it's not a bad thing
who knows it's so trap the same it's a
precious thing you've seen it of course
they did that yeah speaking of of course
they did that I'm gonna talk about
floatplane for a second it's a wonderful
platform you should check it out I heard
that if you if when you go to watch full
plane if you pop some popcorn and like
dim the lights a little bit and stuff
that it will increase the viewership
experience so I would I would recommend
doing that the line is tech tips channel
on here has been going ham so if you
want to check it out you've got Linus
tech tips tech quickie and tech linked
all publishing all under the same
freakin channel which I don't think was
in the agreement when we first started
this so but if you want to check them
out the bargain there is tons of videos
also there's bit wit ultra who's
uploading fantastic stuff and tech deals
who uploaded by far the longest video
that we've had on full plane which was
like that it is just the system it
stressed me a little bit but everything
was okay everything worked fine it was
great we didn't even didn't even let
didn't let us know it was coming which
was actually cool oh yeah because I
heard through another person like oh wow
there's this super long video on the
platform and I was like don't get about
control it's in the past but you still
have to explore I'm happy that transcode
hadn't worked at all but yeah anyways
floatplanes great three bucks per
creator so far because everyone has
decided to have the same price you can
check it out flow playing calm you can
watch videos they look great they sound
great the comment section is much less
cancer than it is on YouTube things are
good so yeah check out floatplane and
now for the rest of the sponsor stuff
we've got bloody gaming can you say your
thing I came in there you see I think
that's actually pretty good I'm like oh
pretty bad though it's like the worst
person in England I do sound like that I
can't do accents at all in it Riley not
really good Riley's really good that
would make sense I could see him being
really good there we go here's my notes
today we're talking about the bloody
gaming benign 7/5 keyboard which isn't
this one despite this being a bloody
keyboard I don't have it here today but
wait no this is the B nine four five
there we go which has the I can't even
show you because under my laptop wait
yeah I can the numpad is on the other
side so like this is where WASD is and
then this is the numpad I think that's
way better for gaming it depends on so
it's actually kind of interesting
especially if you don't use the numpad
that often for
like transactional data style or
something but you might want it for
macros yeah it's an interesting idea
because you wouldn't normally have your
hand on that side of the keyboard but if
you're doing like accounting and stuff
you would much more often be full
keyboard when you're gaming you're very
often just one hand so having a macro
yeah you just have all those that much
more real estate for your macros and
then you've also got this added benefit
of having your mouse closer more gonna
have less shoulder strain okay so yeah
shoulder strain like you're using a it's
like you're using a poker or like a 60%
keyboard but you're not a lot of people
will go with 10 kilos keyboards and then
get a separate 10 key so they can put it
on the other side of their Mouse so that
it can be squared up shoulder shoulder
down to Mouse everything's okay and then
go over for numpad but this is really
easy to yeah just a different idea but
we're talking about the nine seven five
which is standard full-size for those
that don't want to switch form factors
like me double shot ABS key caps less
gamer front text kind of stuff and much
more clean look it includes a wrist rest
with two colors black and red and still
has a 25% off deal with promo code
tech tips check it out on Amazon or in
the links below if you are on YouTube
then next up we have the moss backpack
black back the black oh it is literally
called the black pack yeah I wasn't
going I thought you just were repeatedly
making the same joke you can't trust
anything I say that was fantastic I joke
too often I was like it is it is black
yes it is in fact not on the inside yes
okay this is one of my favorite thing
about this backpack is that is bright
orange on the inside I've had this with
a couple bags it's it's way more
important than you might realize at
beginning because you can find anything
immediately there's a power cable in the
bottom it's right there
you can see it so easily it's actually
great I love backpacks that have bright
orange insides because almost nothing
else is ever bright orange so if you
need to find anything it's super easy
it's also reflective so you notice how
it like glows a little bit just it helps
I don't know I don't know I like it a
lot don't worry about it I'm into
backpacks it's a thing but speaking of
that power cord you have the ability to
plug your backpack in where's the
external access bit do
I know it has it cuz I watched their
video but I don't hear it is so in the
side of the backpack you can pull out a
power cable there it is
this can plug directly into the wall
through a side access port so you don't
have to completely open your bag you
just open where the power cable is then
on the inside of the bag so you can
charge your laptop or whatever else yeah
doesn't it come with I thought I saw in
their video that it like came with a
battery bank or something I don't want
to say it does if it doesn't here yeah
is it in the notes you know what it does
have is they there's a waterproof pocket
there's a pocket over here just for your
water bottle no so you put your water in
there and it's completely sealed off
everything safe and if your bags too
full you can pull that out and just have
the water hanging on the outside that's
cool I like that but attached to that
power cable is a standard power plug for
like your laptop or something and then
two USB ports which is actually pretty
sweet I like that a lot
because then you can charge your laptop
and you can charge your mobile devices
it has a pass-through right here into
the front so if you have your phone
lodged up in the front or something then
that will work but yeah you can charge
your you can charge a battery battery
bank you can charge your phone and your
laptop all by plugging your backpack
into the wall without needing to take
anything out of it that's super cool if
you're a commuter or something like that
you just want to come home and plug the
bag in you don't want to take a lot of
stuff out that's fantastic
they call that a reach C power adapter
pretty cool it's a 60 watt USB type-c
port for a macbook or other type c
device that is sweet but yeah great
backpack feel free to check it out
also last sponsor is savage jerky
Sauvage sahaj okay savage jerky they've
been on the show a million times you
guys kind of know what it's about but
I'm gonna go over it anyways jerky is
made with the best ingredients without
nitrates or preservatives their goal is
to create a snack that's full of flavor
and just it isn't supposed to be bad for
you either that's cool people seem to
like the sriracha bacon apparently
that's quite popular I like
pretty much everything they have every
one of these bags is open yeah you just
they always get eaten thank you people
find the box and then steal them my
favorite personal one is Moho but again
I like literally all of their flavors so
that that works for me you can use offer
code LTT to say 10% off their products
which is cool and they also have one of
them I'm not sure where it is hey Ivan
keeps eating it so it could be gone but
what if theirs is made with the like the
hottest peppers in the world the
Carolina Reaper they have a Reaper of
jerky oh yes
that's pretty dang haughtily kick your
butt so if you're into that feel free to
check it out
and we're back oh we're going back what
are you going to do now let's talk about
Alexa sorry I said it
Amazon echo oh no so there's a family in
I believe Oregon Portland and they were
hanging out and suddenly a phone call
came in to the husband and it was one of
his employees who lives in I believe
Seattle many many miles away and the guy
was like quick unplug all your al EXA
devices you're getting hacked and what
had happened was for whatever reason the
echo started recording at at a time that
the inhabitants of the house did not
know it was recording and recorded a big
conversation they had then it proceeded
to send the audio files to a random
person in their contact list and so this
guy called and you know that the
husband's like what are you talking
about you're just joking like yeah right
haha good one of the guys like no you
were talking about your hardwood floors
like I heard it and they're like oh god
and so then they caught they contacted
Amazon and Amazon put an engineer to
investigate right away and eventually a
statement came out first the engineer
said like there will be a fix it kind of
made it seem he didn't just brush it off
as user errors like we're gonna fix
something but then the statement comes
out and it's kind of it's not user error
but it the system acted kind of as
intended so here's what the
where the heck are we here here's this
here's the the events what happened
echo woke up due to a word in a
background conversation sounding like
the hot word then the subsequent
conversation was heard as send message
request at which point the echo said out
loud
to whom now if the volume was turned
down it and they're ranked far away then
they wouldn't have heard that right at
which point the background conversation
was interpreted as a name in the
customers contact list so they kept
having this conversation and the echo is
just kind of picking out where it's like
I think it said send message I think it
said to Craig and then and then it
carried out that that request and so as
unlikely as a string of events like that
is Amazon is evaluating the options to
make the case even less likely at the
same time like you have you have a smart
home device yeah how often have you had
it spring up and do something weird
lately seems like more than your way to
do quite a bit so I've got my my Google
home Mini I've went into the settings
and turned on the settings so that when
you Hale it it goes Bing which is off by
default normally it just would light up
and I had people across the house they'd
be trying to hail it and maybe they're
not very experienced with it and they
wouldn't know whether or not it had
heard them so I put on the feedback
noise but that's also super helpful too
because if I'm watching a movie and the
movie says something like no you go and
that sounds like yeah hey then I'll hear
it and I can just say never mind and
it'll it'll turn off again but I guess
what's happening here is the way that
these that this that machine learning
works basically but this kind of thing
is there's a probability that when I
hear something it'll say okay that's a
that's a point eight out of one let's
say there's an 80% chance that they just
said what I think they said and then
there's a decision threshold so the
engineers will say anything greater than
a point seven five is good and so that
counts as we're gonna call that a
positive so you can shift that decision
threshold based on
the stakes of whatever you're talking
about so if you're talking about a spam
email for example calling something
letting in spam when it's not spam
that's not that high-stakes because then
you log in your email and you have a
speck you have some spam and then you're
like oh that's annoying I'm just gonna
delete it but calling it an email that
is not spam spam is can be catastrophic
because then you don't get back to the
client or you miss an important
appointment or whatever so what do you
need to do to fix this I think is
they're probably going to have to adjust
the decision threshold so that they get
less false or fewer false positives but
then the flip side of that is you're
gonna be like to be more fresh I use hey
and it's not gonna hear you when there's
music playing or something like that so
they just need to dance around that yeah
it's it's that's an extremely delicate
and difficult thing to do especially
because there's gonna be so many
different environments that it's gonna
be used in there's gonna be so many
different accents vocal levels some
people are quiet
some people are loud like it's they're
probably gonna have to personalize it
per on a per user basis just have it
learn each one learn its own owner yeah
I'd be cool well I mean I know that the
Google one does that already for my
voice did they have a voice match I was
like when I say call Mom it calls my mom
or place good music to me is different
than good music to my wife who's just
wasn'ts the dead most and that's it
strobes a good song she'd learned that
on piano we got a piano she only learned
that song it was like it was not easy so
it took her like months that's all she
played and then she figured it out and
then she never played piano again and I
was like you have learned the song
faster if you just learned easy songs
first that's fantastic
speaking of fantastic or not essential
is up for sale like the phone company
it's a rumor it's a rumor they haven't
officially announced it but it's come
the story's coming from you know those
in the know yeah I hate rumors so I'm
not really that interested but
apparently the next phone also rumor has
been cancelled also rumor so I don't
know do people care
a lot of people seem to care I saw a lot
of comments in the forum that were like
I didn't buy it
but I was interested in it and I was a
bug bite or I was planning on buying the
next iteration cuz I actually didn't
really know much about the essential
phone I was looking at today and I was
like nothing's sick yeah it's sweet so I
actually kind of recommended it to a few
different people or at least the idea of
looking into it and comparing it for
their own option but I don't I don't
know general public wise hmm like how
much people come they didn't do a whole
lot of advertising they didn't have
legal I had a lot of fanfare maybe in
tech circles but for the public not sure
it looked pretty bold I mean this was
the first phone with a notch but it came
out before the iPhone 10 and the not
just smaller it's almost completely
completely bedless it's a nice looking
eye I care Samsung or Apple only or I
don't care
Samsung or Apple only what about like
Google phones that that would be I don't
care or I care what are they do the
Samsung or Apple only option is like a
weird way of me being like no I'm not
really that into phones oh because I I
see you when people don't really know
phones to that that much they're like oh
I don't know if I should buy an apple or
a Samsung because they just don't even
like the Android category is seen as
Sams you know what I get a lot
especially when iPhone tens were new
this would be sitting on the table is
that an iPhone 10 no it's not
Oh what is that thing it's an LG v 30
interest lost an LG okay good of a guy
it get roasted out the bar you trying to
wheel some lady and get wait what got
roasted but like she's like what kind of
phone is that it's like oh it's an LG
she's like what like iPhone or died like
delete your tinder you have an LG like I
don't actually really want to have an LG
but this is a sweet phone other like
they just have quality control issues
that are really doing my third one just
incidentally and everyone's had like the
same kind of
like it doesn't detect my sim or
something like that I really liked a g3
i the LG g3 yeah I really like that
phone so most people don't care fifty
fifty-one percent of people say I don't
care straight-up eighteen eighteen
percent of people say Samsung or Apple
only I expected there'd be a surprising
percentage there and then thirty-one
percent of people care that's actually
way more than I thought well so that's
that's cool
the thing with the essential phone was
that it was like the closest of stock
Android you could get outside of a pixel
and that's awesome amazing yeah and it
was way cheaper eventually when it
launched it was seven hundred bucks I
don't think it could have competed
against other flagships in that price
range but when they were struggling and
they dropped it to 500 or even less then
it was like a hell of a deal
maybe they should have opened up with
that but then they had 300 million
dollars of investment they spent a
hundred million of it developing the
phone so they just needed to sell these
things yeah essentially raised about
three hundred million dollars from
several investors like you just
mentioned ten yeah $0.10 the least
surprising group on this list ever
amazon.com and redpoint ventures as well
it was valued at 900 million to a
billion dollars a year ago so if it is
indeed for sale today probably be a lot
less than that I would also assume the
same current discussions are focused on
again this is rumors current discussions
are focused on a sale of the entire
company including its patent portfolio
and hardware products like the original
smartphone an upcoming smart home device
and a camera attachment for the phone
essentials engineering talent which
includes those hired from Apple Inc and
alphabet inks alphabet inks Google would
likely be a part of the deal which is
probably quite valuable do you think the
the founder of Android who made this his
name Rubin Andy Rubin and also be in
that yeah I don't know or is he the one
selling it and getting the heck out
maybe but there could be one of those
like don't remember the name of it right
now but it's those clauses where when
the company gets bought you have to like
stay on in order to get the good chunk
of the money I don't golden handcuffs
yeah people call that not necessarily
hang-ups is a that's
necessarily with mergers that's just
like any employee yeah like it takes
four years for your shares the best or
whatever so you kind of need to stick
around before you get the real money
yeah go when the handcuffs disease for a
bunch of different stuff just when it
has to do with like I am staying weekend
big money Apple and Volkswagen are
apparently gonna be making driverless
cars it's a interesting two names to be
in the top the the Apple making a
driverless car thing has been that was
guessed by Linus like five years ago or
something like that it makes a lot of
sense like they like design the holy
grail of design is in industrial design
his cars so it's a pretty easy guess but
it's been a roller coaster since they
they did have announced that they were
gonna make a car that was gonna disrupt
it Detroit and just kick all the butt
but then they scaled that back to being
like well it's actually really hard to
make a car so why will make the internal
components and all the sensors and
everything for the self-driving will
partner with someone like BMW because
Tim Cook lips BMW or with Mercedes and
then those companies were like nope
because Apple one is control of all the
data or something some other aspect that
you know those companies they bailed so
it's like they're and then they had
negotiate into negotiations with I
believe Lexus now they're on their like
their fourth choice Volkswagens like
yeah we'd love to work with you and
they're not even it's gonna be at like a
standard Volkswagen what is it it's a
particular model here t6 yeah t6 van t6
transporter the frame wheels and chassis
of the t6 vans will remain but Apple is
replacing many components such as the
dashboard and the seats the computers
and sensors and they're of course
putting in a large electric car battery
now this isn't gonna be a consumer
product
oh no it's not like they're just they're
making these vans and you're gonna be
able to buy one this is a project for
them to just start getting their feet
wet with self-driving it's gonna be a
van that transports the
own employees between various Apple
campuses so they can it's kind of close
to bursting like hey if you screw up
your engineering project you'll kill all
your friends oh wow yeah it makes make
sure you do it well guys that's that's
interesting I was I was very surprised
to read the like not going to be
initially commercially available except
for literally just themselves line but
that's probably a fairly sensible way of
going about that yeah apparently it's
been quite a cluster there's no
indication right now if Bolton will be
on for anything beyond the internal van
experiment and according to the the
article that we cited you hear from the
New York Times there is a bunch of it
okay sorry someone in chat will they
call it the bend wagon I love it I don't
get it cuz thats the first half of the
show how nice I like it I think it's
good so he would never call it that that
doesn't make sense that joke does make
sense I disagree smokin they would call
that like impeccably designed engineered
with purpose wagon it's a feature not a
bug wagon 6i wagon but so the all the
reporting came from ex-employees and
they basically said that the whole
project was as brutal executives
executives leading apples car project
had told him cook that the shuttle would
be completed by the end of 2018 but that
deadline will almost certainly be missed
according to one of these people and
they also said that the project
reportedly lacks a clear plan beyond the
vans including any near-term commercial
goals so it's hey there's a big wave
we're doing but we don't really know
what to do Steve Jobs is dead help us
we're not making very good company
Joanie I just wants to design fashion
speaking of comfy decisions best segue
Amazon bans users for too many returns
boom CNET article apparently you buy you
keep yeah amazon has many customers who
take advantage of its generous return
policy and closing their accounts in
corn
to the National Retail Federation eleven
percent of sales are returned that seems
like a lot compared to my track record
of returning things and eleven percent
of those are fraudulent which sounds
super coincidental but whatever they
have 300 million customers customers are
not being warned of bands but amazon has
reinstated the accounts of those that
appeal convincingly yeah cuz some of
this a lot of people are really mad
because they get banned and they're like
I returned six things in the last year
which these depending on how much you
buy it could be a lot or not and then
each one of those things had a good
reason
no they it's sucked it didn't the things
in the Box weren't what was expected or
whatever so but I don't blame Amazon for
not giving some kind of um threshold
like you need to if you return more than
X per year or if you return 15% your
stuff then you're gonna get banned it's
obviously they're not gonna give those
numbers though because then people will
just game it yeah and just and right
right right or return as much stuff as
they can while still getting away with
it so it makes sense that they that they
would do that or like buy a bunch of
really really low to get things they
don't care about and then screw with
your return policy on the higher stuff I
don't know yeah I don't get it it also
makes sense that if you like first of
all they need to clean out this kind of
behavior because it's a lot of money
with you're talking about that many
returns that makes an impact that's
millions of dollars on the top line or
bottom line or whatever line makes sense
I don't really know finances and it also
makes sense to just ban everyone in one
fell swoop and then just take on the
appeals as they come in and yeah then a
human can just directly deal with it and
then reinstate your account if if you're
worthy of that that's something they can
probably do and it's the wording of that
made it sound like they're probably
doing this is like if you appeal you'll
probably get back in well I wrote that
okay I wasn't even copy paste well
alright then but I bet you it's that way
anyways if you appeal you'll probably be
fine yeah well if you're like yeah well
I just didn't know all problems they'll
probably let you back in because most
people if you banned some
and it was like okay no that's not true
because of moderating on the forum
people will do terrible things and then
you ban them and they're like what so
yeah I don't know actually
it's gonna be easy for them to bet to
keep banned the people they ban who are
actually offenders of this in a big way
like the people who are buying eight
hundred things a year returning seven
hundred things or something like that or
or just like literally buying a TV and
returning it so they can yeah or some
kind of other discernible pattern like
that yeah I feel like it'll have to be
pretty blatant for them to like keep
your ban after an appeal yeah I know
that they do they're pretty savage with
some other things I was talking to a
friend who has an an Amazon
he's like an Amazon seller for a
business as his business and there's
they're really strict about fake reviews
right but what they were doing was like
they'll actually send you a product for
you to review so you bought you bought
it from them you can be a real seller or
a real buyer of the product and then you
get the product and then you're supposed
to give a five-star review and the way
that they did this was that they give
discounts to every all of those
potential reviewers because you don't
want to like sell an item full price
Amazon takes a large part of that just
to get this that's like a high cost for
a fake review you want to get your fake
review at the cheapest level possible so
then you just if it's a hundred dollar
item you send it you give a ninety five
percent off so it's like five bucks and
then Amazon just gets a dollar or
whatever and then you get your fake
review so what amazon did is they went
through and they said any item that was
sold at a discount was all those reviews
are gone now so you just loss of like a
30-year reviews good I don't know I
think that's completely okay because the
amount of like well unless you actually
just had a discount code or something
like that that was legit and all those
people were like super happy yeah I
tried it for the first time it's great I
just came to amazon.com slash man or
whatever and got my product and I loved
it and here's a five-star review that's
legit but it's gone now because they're
throwing out the baby with the bathwater
yeah okay that's fair I just something
that drive drove me insane was I was I'm
not gonna disclose who and largely
because I don't know if they had ever
actually ended up doing anything with
this guy I know the guy was there
but I don't know what type of
Association there was I don't know if
they were actually doing any business
etc Center so I'm not gonna say the
company name but one year at CES I went
to a company's hotel suite and to film a
video and there was a dude there and he
was hanging out and I was waiting for my
meeting so it's just like hey let's
let's talk I'm I'm we're both over tired
we're at CES let's chat about stuff just
asked him what he did he was one of the
like business acquisition guys for a
company that post facebook fake reviews
Oh on Amazon there's a whole giant
company there's a huge industry of like
clique farms yeah all people do all days
like create accounts and then like pages
and he was like essentially one of those
guys and I remember like I may have not
been the nicest person you are a dirt
you are a single uni actor because it
kind of pissed me off but like these are
absolutely a thing oh yeah they're
running around CES with badges like this
was this was yeah this is a pretty big
industry so I'm very happy to be showing
you I think that in some countries it's
like a large sector just like tourism is
a big sector in some countries yeah
click farms is like a big deal in in
individual particular countries yeah
just like scams are in some parts of
western Africa it's like we're all we're
all making money just scamming North
America those phone numbers that call
you and try to get your banking info
hacker ville hacker ville hacker ville
is an interesting thing anyways the show
is over
Oh boom see ya later
see you never whatever guys I'll see you
next week bye ah can I see
better just probably better just sign up
for applet flame Club port and then get
early access to whatever it is we're
doing on hopefully in club yes alright
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
