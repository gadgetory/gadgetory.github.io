garage
which might not seem interesting see we
got a motorbike we got a strobe rackets
turning machine we got like some crab
that we're not using using different
cribs so yeah lots of cool stuff in here
you know like some painting equipments
and carpet and office chair and mat you
know tools and stuff so the tools are
where things start to get interesting
because I am repurposing my garage to be
my makeshift studio so this wall right
here is actually built out away from the
garage door so that it will be obvious
that I'm in my garage when I'm filming
things you know if anything will be sort
of something like that this is gonna be
like a white box so I'm gonna prime and
paint with just a flat white finish
these two walls and then I'll get some
kind of a table that I can put in there
that's also white so I can take really
nice close-ups of stuff and it'll be all
surrounded by white and look all white
and stuff and look all nice so there's
that this is obviously not intended for
you know sort of white box-type shots so
this is gonna be the red wall and I'm
not sure if I'm quite satisfied with the
flatness of this paint yet but we'll see
how it goes once it dries it's only been
on the wall for me an hour and a half or
so so it's definitely got time it's
quite cold in here and you can see
actually that the wall is not very well
finished oh my goodness look there's
holes in the wall it's okay because I'm
going to put these on there so I'm going
to be replacing the peg boards that were
on my wall before with blue peg boards
so these blue peg boards will have all
kinds of cool stuff hanging from them
and they will be in sort of a line kind
of right along here and then I'm gonna
have those bookshelves there with some
cool stuff on them and then this part
you guys won't see or you might or I
don't know it doesn't really matter
these tables though are gonna get the
paint treatment as well so I've got this
hey focus there you go
so I've got this finish of
that I'm gonna put on there since should
get around I love this camera should
give you guys a really good idea what
they're gonna look like and I'm going to
coat this table so if you guys have been
watching my videos lately you've seen
from my windows 8 touchscreen demos how
I want to have the tables arranged so
there's two of them and I have decided
to try this I don't know if it's gonna
work but these are harddrive packing
phones if it doesn't work then I'm just
gonna man up and and buy echo reduction
foam so I'm gonna cover the ceiling in
those and then I have the well had a
concrete floor in my garage before I see
that concrete floor so I have obtained
for free some of the most horrendous
green carpet that I've ever seen in my
life
and that should help with a little bit
of echo reduction on the floor as well
there's there is foamy underneath it so
hopefully that will that will contribute
to the helping those are my shoes by the
way can you believe they were on
clearance can you believe these shoes
were on clearance unbelievable right
they used to be like fuchsia
whereas now they're pretty beat-up so
they were like fuchsia white lime green
and horrible yellow with fuchsia laces
just amazing I love them my wife doesn't
love them so yeah I just wanted to give
you guys an in-progress and let you know
how things are going and I'm very
excited about all the cool stuff that
I'm gonna be doing with my new studio
space at some point that corner over
there will turn into something so I'll
do another another fake wall like this
and then I'll probably just do one no
and then that light switch will just
stay and there will just be a wall that
goes in front of the garage door but
yeah that's gonna be that's gonna be
exciting as well sucks not having a
garage but I think some of the cool
content I'll be able to bring you guys
in here will make it all worth it don't
