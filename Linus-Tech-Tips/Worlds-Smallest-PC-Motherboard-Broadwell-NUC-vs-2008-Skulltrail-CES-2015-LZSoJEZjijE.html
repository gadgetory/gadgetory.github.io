brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so this is it we've got
Broadwell all over the freaking place
all of a sudden so Intel is trumpeting a
variety of things about this so of
course we've got slightly better
performance per clock but the big story
is has got to be power consumption so
thanks to its extremely low power
consumption and heat output Broadwell is
enabling a whole new class of devices
for these guys so check this out this is
actually a fully functional Broadwell so
this chip on here so right here this
package has a CPU and GPU right here and
then it's actually got a chipset right
here that CPU goes anywhere from one
point 1 - 2 point 6 gigahertz it's a
dual core and the GPU even more
impressively
Intel's gots awesome 3d mark ice storm
stuff going on over here they're saying
actually outperforms the recently
announced Tegra x1 where they're taking
what they're calling it's actually kind
of funny so for the first time they're
taking a leadership position in 3d
graphics in really any kind of space I
mean who saw this one coming I mean
probably the people paying very close
attention to how much of the die size of
recent Intel CPUs is dedicated to
graphics but other than that you didn't
stand much of a chance also on this
board is four gigs of ram on the back
you've got an interface that allows an
SSD up to 512 gigs and intel cheated a
little bit here with me so they told me
oh well Linus it only weighs here we can
wait for our scale to go come on over
here it only weighs uh 12 grams but of
course they didn't put the copper
heatsink on it that obviously it's gonna
need so let's go ahead and 12 grams
that's a massive 14 grams you liars so
it's still the lightest PC that I've
ever encountered we're gonna see this in
a variety of different devices so this
one's a pretty incredible little number
just to make my point about how light it
is
here I'm gonna hold it by as tiny a
corner as I possibly can that is how
light this little Panasonic device is I
don't even know what this is this is the
Ã§f rz4 it is a full-fledged computer
yes fully oh you've got your USB 3
SuperSpeed all that nonsense three of
those Gigabit Ethernet this is not a
cut-down device in any way and it is
running a board like that inside we've
got the other one here so this is the
demo machine that they're using in order
to make their point about how fast
graphics are so you saw me just pull it
off of the base the computer itself is
not in the base of this device at all it
is actually all up here same thing one
point one turn all the way up to two
point six gigahertz this is some
tomfoolery magic that they're doing
because the power consumption of these
chips is gonna be anywhere from four and
a half to six watts and then at the very
high end 15 watts but thanks to their 14
nanometer manufacturing process and some
little tricks with being able to push
like massive amounts of current through
it for micro seconds at a time enabling
exactly the performance you need when
you need it you're able to achieve well
the kinds of things that we're looking
at right here and still have a device
that doesn't get so hot you have to drop
it I was hoping to get more of a
reaction from you guys I should have
gone for a longer drop before I caught
it usually I get people to freak out
we've got another cool one here so this
is actually more filled this is not
unfortunately Broadwell so it's not
exactly something that launched just now
but the device itself launched today
this is the venue eight from Dell this
has a two gigahertz quad core in it
it's an android-based tablet and this is
a pretty sick looking little device it's
got an eight point four inch 2560 by
1600 OLED screen it's got 2 gigs of RAM
16 gigs of storage on the model that I'm
holding today and what's kind of cool
about it is I don't know if you guys can
see what's going on with this picture
right here where it's like there okay
the background and foreground are
shifting separately anyway it's got a 3d
camera on the back which is a pretty
neat little feature to have this is six
millimeters thick and as far as Android
tablets go it takes a fair bit to
impress me but I'm impressed by how thin
it is I'm impressed by how gorgeous it
is and I'm impressed that Intel managed
to get a design win in a tablet this
small and this thin because they've been
kind of beating this drum for a while
and we haven't seen much success but
here it is guys that is an
absolutely beautiful little device to
drive home the point because I mean oh
yeah here's Edison I've actually never
touched one
so the lightest computer in the world
Bluetooth wireless CPU all that kind of
stuff on there that's pretty freakin
cool so I've criticized Intel in the
past particularly on our podcast saying
I you know it feels like they've
abandoned you know the enthusiast a
little bit you know they're not really
giving us dual-processor systems anymore
and all that crazy stuff I actually
happened to be standing in the same room
as one of the one of the founders of the
whole Skull trail concept over at Intel
where it which is one of the things I
love to harken back to the last time
they cared about us they gave us dual
processors on a single motherboard they
let us overclock the snot out of it
those were the good old days but I don't
know I guess another perspective on all
that I'm still gonna keep ragging on
them until I see you know dual
processors and on overclockable
motherboards but I guess another
perspective on that a point that Intel's
trying to make and I kind of messed up
the demo here but this is a demo that
they actually showed off on Skull trail
back when they launched it in 2008 they
had like minus 40 degree liquid cooling
on the bloody thing in order to get this
to even run hopefully there we go
there's the pictures of the machine so
we've got like a touch interface thing
going on here this is the rig they had
running dual processors quad GPUs let's
go ahead and okay we'll zoom in more I
haven't actually used this before so I'm
trying this for the first time anyway
there we go
that's what they were running that was
the board it was running and they ran
this demo and blew people away with it
so what was at 350,000 photos or
something like that and okay about three
hundred billion pixels and being able to
interact with it like this in real time
was like this amazing thing holy crap
look at what we built and then they kind
of lift up the curtain here and show
that they now have that demo from 2008
running on their new Broadwell nook
right there yes it's getting a little
bit toasty no it doesn't seem
particularly happy about running the
demo but it is actually doing it so
there you go I guess that's Moore's law
at work are they ignoring enthusiasts
you could look at it that way
or are they just making enthusiast
hardware very different and then it used
to look in the past well that's what
I'll say but all the Intel people
watching me here in the suite either way
it's a very cool demo and it's amazing
to see how far we've come in six years I
mean think about that
oh I missed one bring-bring please so
this is another little cool this is
another Broadwell device so this is from
a soos same thing totally detachable
tablet totally thin absolutely
unbelievable this one doesn't have the
2.6 gigahertz turbo SKU in it did you
end up looking at the CPU speed is it
about 2.6 all right well there you go I
lied I misled you guys I'm very sorry I
apologize it's only barely thick enough
you can see there's just enough room for
the panel the touch interface and then a
three and a half millimeter jack that is
it that is all the space there is on
this tablet / Convertible / 2 + 1 /
whatever marketing name there is for it
these days so pretty amazing stuff going
on here and I'm looking forward to more
reviews of guys let me know what devices
you want to see us check out and we will
try to do that over the next little
while also don't miss any of our CES
coverage make sure you guys are
subscribed and I want to spend a moment
to give a huge shout out to our sponsors
phantom glass visits tour dot phantom
dot glass for the best on screen
protectors out there you won't be able
to see that there's a screen protector
on my phone but it's because it's made
of Gorilla Glass
it is fingerprint resistant it is
scratch resistant it has absolutely no
bubbles under it I don't think you could
put bubbles under a phantom glass screen
protector if you tried so you can find a
link to that in the video description
below and also shout out to Kings -
excuse me
HyperX I hope they don't watch this one
it's HyperX not Kingston HyperX so check
out the HyperX youtube channel over at
youtube.com slash HyperX has got a lot
of great gaming content we'll have that
linked in the video description as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
