stuff only one person I knew had a
big-screen TV
the screen size was just under 50 inches
it took up half their living room and it
weighed as much as the country squire
now with the projector you can get a
much bigger screen size out of something
you can carry under your arm but not
everybody's into the washed out
Instagram filter over all of their
movies could there be a solution
introducing the del s 718 QL the world's
first high brightness 4k uhd ultra sort
throw laser projector the math drop-in
Sen hyzer HD 6 xx open-back headphones
are available now for only $1.99 99 us
check them out at the link below
we have never reviewed a laser projector
before and that's because up until now
their prices have been so high that they
were only used in premium large-format
applications I mean now this one is
still six thousand dollars but when
you're talking about high-end
installations that is getting pretty
close to mainstream prosumer I mean
consider that an 82 inch 4k HDR TV would
run you about five grand and that Sony's
groundbreaking short for a laser
projector debuted at 50 grand
so the s7 18 QL I'm just gonna call it
kylo Ren looks pretty good by comparison
it projects much brighter images up to a
hundred and thirty inches while also
overcoming many of the installation
headaches of traditional projectors you
see because kylo is an ultra short throw
model his lens can generate a 100 inch
image from just 15 inches away so you
can just chuck him on a normal TV stand
for a normal looking living room no
matter what the dimensions of your room
are plus you don't have to worry about
people blocking the shot or presenters
getting blinded yes okay so projectors
are cool short throw projectors are even
cooler but why pay more for laser well
there are actually a lot of reasons
starting with brightness conventional
lamp projectors shine a single white
light at a spinning color wheel which
separates the light into the desired
colors unfortunately this means that
about 80% of the light from the bulb is
actually wasted and ends up being
diverted or blocked at any given time by
contrast
laser projectors emit light using lasers
that switch rapidly on and off as needed
this allows them to power on instantly
because lasers have no warmup time it
allows them to take the same amount of
power from the wall but shine much more
brightly up to five
lumens in this case and it even
contributes to lower black levels
because they don't have a bunch of
diverted white light bouncing around
inside the projector giving the dark
areas of the scene and LCD like glow now
to be clear it's a very different
technology but the result ends up more
similar to OLED in the sense that black
areas get very little to no illumination
at all so all of this culminates then in
Kyllo not just managing to look good
even in a lit room but also support HDR
content while doing it still not seeing
the big picture because laser projectors
don't have a superhot light bulb inside
you won't hear as much fan noise while
watching a movie
Kyle ohhere operates at around thirty
six decibels even quieter in Eco mode
and the laser system is rated for twenty
thousand hours of use which is a far cry
from the 3000 hours of a typical bulb so
that's nearly a decade of screen time
even at 40 hours a week but alas not all
laser projectors are created equal Dell
was able to hit this price point because
Kyllo here doesn't have dedicated lasers
for RG and B instead he's got an array
of blue lasers which like many lamp
projectors still rely on spinning color
wheels one of the biggest downsides to
this approach then is something called
the rainbow effect which is most
noticeable when you move your eyes
quickly around on the screen some people
don't notice it or care about it but
others will find it bothersome with some
people even complaining that even when
they're staring in one spot it can make
them feel sick as for the experience of
using this one though honestly everyone
who saw it including Brandon was really
impressed by the contrast of the image
even at a hundred inches in a lit room
and how subtle the rainbow effect was as
for gaming it should serve console
gamers just fine but if you're used to
playing competitive shooters with a
mouse and keyboard the input leg might
be
than ideal so this is a really different
generation of projectors one with the
advantages that they've always held and
without many of the disadvantages that
have made them hard to recommend for all
but the biggest cinema nerds with
dedicated theater rooms with blackout
blinds in the past and it'll even look
good in your living room
I mean we've obviously been teasing Dell
about the look of it but the industrial
design is pretty clean with a mix of
matte and glossy black on top and a
brushed metal motif on a completely
unbranded front which we really
appreciated now I was personally a
little disappointed at the lack of
DisplayPort inputs because we're kind of
all PC dorks around here but overall
it's got a pretty solid mix of i/o as
well including the ability to connect it
to wireless speakers over Bluetooth if
the dual 6 quad integrated speakers
aren't enough for you or even operate
without a PC because it can accept
Network sources a capability that I plan
to use for remote employee motivation so
time to buy then well if you've got 6
G's burning a hole in your pocket then
sure
I mean 10-bit color HDR there's nothing
else quite like it on the market right
now but there's still some room for
improvement right now Smart TV like
functionality like plex or Netflix will
require a separate box like a Roku or an
Apple TV and actually it's pretty
awesome I don't know maybe future ones
will be cheaper who knows I can't
project the future video blocks is the
place to go to get studio quality stock
footage audio and images for a fraction
of the cost it's great and we've used it

videos and a hundred thousand dollar
clips all the content is royalty-free so
you can use it for commercial or
personal projects new content gets added

fresh to download and it starts at just
149 so go to video blog
