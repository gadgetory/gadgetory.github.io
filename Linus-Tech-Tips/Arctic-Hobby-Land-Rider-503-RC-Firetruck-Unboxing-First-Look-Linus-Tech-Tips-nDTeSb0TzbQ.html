this is made by Arctic hobby you might
notice the logo looks a little bit like
Arctic cooling get the ultimate riding
experience with this fire truck as you
can plainly see it's huge okay and the
package contents are fairly
straightforward so you get a fire truck
a remote control some batteries
another more different battery yet
another more different battery and
finally a charging cable so you can buy
the fire truck online at NCIX as always
and keep the scheme to get really
confused by this but as always I have
listed the link to the product on NCIX
in the description of the video so
people are always like - why don't you
talk about the prices of the product in
your videos and I say well because the
prices change and the video cannot be
updated but a link can be updated so
that is why I never talk about prices in
my videos but I do provide links to the
products available for purchase at a
particular price in the description so
here we go the fire truck features
I don't want to miss any of this stuff
okay
Peters instructions which tell us how to
enable all of the different
functionality of the truck however I
will need a screwdriver in order to
install the batteries and whatnot so
give me a couple seconds I'm just gonna
let you get a couple of sort of glamour
shots of the fire truck itself and then
I'll be back in just a moment so the
included items we have an antenna for
the remote we've also got a 9-volt
battery for the remote three double A
batteries for the bottom of the fire
engine okay and then we've got this
little charging cable adapter doodad
that works with the Arctic hobby
charging station now you can also get
these guys separately which charge the
cable or charge the battery pack
directly so that's six cells in there
that's a seven point two full volt 800
million power battery pack okay so we're
gonna go ahead and put all these things
aside for now and don't worry in this
video we will be showing you guys all of
the features of this fire truck
including coming right out of the
packaging just like that alright oh very
exciting here let's get this styrofoam
cleared out of the way here so it's a
bit of an ordeal installing all the
batteries so I'm gonna do that
off-camera as well but I do want to show
you guys the basic layout of the fire
engine first the first thing you're
gonna want to do is take this at
receiving antenna right here and plug
the straw into the hole down there so
that it stands up that is going to keep
it from getting in the way of the ladder
which is pretty much the coolest ladder
I've ever seen because it extends and
lifts and rotates yes it has all of the
functionality of a fire engine ladder so
that is to say it comes up this way it
extends out this way
and it rotates around this way okay now
this fire nozzle our fire nozzle water
nozzle
at the end remember you don't have to
get that close here at the end actually
sprays water so there's a reservoir
right here that we can fill with water
and let's have here we'll do a quick
sort of overview of the fire engine
itself so yeah I'm gonna lift this up so
we can have a good look you can see
these are rubber tires very very nice
good traction on those tires okay we got
our mirror right there with reflective
shiny surface okay we've got you know
chrome accents including the fire hose
nozzles to which you practically can't
hook anything up I'm very disappointed
about that but you know how it is okay
we've also got these stabilizers and
these do serve a purpose so you want to
bring these out whenever you're gonna
take the ladder extend it and move it
over to the side so that's very
important got another couple of wheels
here got an axe just in case you need
one of those moving around to the back
check this out you can pull things if
you so want so desire okay it's a little
tight right now but you know you can use
this little handle here to open it up
and close it retract it there we go so
we're just gonna have fat back there
where it was okay coming around to the
other side we got another axe okay we've
got all of our you know hydraulics and
whatnot got a fire department logos more
shiny stuff and then you guys can check
out the front of the fire engine so here
we have our horn by the way it does have
a realistic sounding horn honking we
have our side are our lights okay and it
does have a siren that goes off when it
moves here's our bumper windshield
wipers realistic okay okay so I'm gonna
put the batteries in and we're gonna
show you guys how this bad boy works in
just a moment so first I'm going to show
you guys all the advanced functionality
of the land rider 503 so here you can
see we can select either the ladder or
the wheel I mean I think they means
steering wheel and we're gonna go with
all of the ladder functions first so
ladder up
you're gonna want to go ahead and adjust
that a little bit otherwise that's
definitely gonna spill okay we're gonna
go ahead and take our support struts out
of the side of the that's okay you'll
see the other side when I take them up
there we go okay there we go
so that we don't tip over the land Rider
503 then we're gonna take our ladder
we're gonna move it to a little bit to
the right
oh whoops okay okay now we're gonna go
ahead and extend the ladder I press the
wrong thing sorry guys
I think slick knows what's coming
[Laughter]
okay so we're gonna fire the water I'm
going to show you guys the range here so
it may want to step back a little bit so
that they can gather some some feel for
this scope of what we're doing here can
you see it at all so it definitely does
fire water okay so we're gonna bring
that ladder right back down
oh look at that you can do two things at
once okay we're gonna bring that back
down to rest right there okay so we have
secured the fire engine oh yeah I
haven't shown you guys the horn yet hold
on wait for it
yeah that won't get old fast when your
kids are running around doing it okay
okay but wait but wait but wait but wait
it gets even better okay so we're gonna
take the fire engine for a drive here so
we're gonna switch over to wheel mode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
