test running on the sli performance
package version of the Vesta 3050 series
so this one is actually 1199 so it's
around 1200 canadian dollars compared to
the other one which is around 900
canadian dollars but you do get some
pretty cool upgrades for your extra 300
bucks i mean i had people saying oh well
that's not a very good gaming machine
blah blah blah I mean well it's nine
hundred dollars what do you expect so
for a few hundred more dollars you get
an i5 760 quad-core you get an
additional gtx460 you get an upgraded
power supply so the actual one on the
Builder is that is a seasonic 600 watt
which is actually is this plugged into
the power meter right now yeah right now
pulling 371 wats from the wall so it's
more than enough and then you also get
an upgrade to a 1.5 terabyte hard drive
so I want to emphasize that this is
crisis running at 1920 x 1080 so you can
see up here in the corner our average
FPS is just under 40 and and we're
actually running this with all of the
details options maxed out as well as 2x
anti-aliasing so this is pretty much the
highest graphical quality that you can
get out of crisis and I think that's
pretty much everything I wanted to say
so I'm just going to quit the time demo
ha there we go and then we can close
that close do this anyway so if you want
to find these you can either click the
link under the YouTube video that works
or if you go on the NCIX site you can
either go to buy a PC and then navigate
through an X fusion to either the Vesta
I 3 30 50 s Li Bais so that's the basic
package which we already showed the
performance of the other day and then
there's also be I 5 30 50 s Li
performance so that's the the twelve
hundred dollar package that we're
showing right now so actually you know
what I showed 3dmark for the other one
which was around 14,000 points and this
one scores about 24,000 points so for
another few hundred bucks you actually
get a lot more gaming performance for
your dollar something else to bear in
mind we have a lot of people comparing
their rigs against what we're doing here
and saying oh well I've got a quad core
but then they would say things like oh
but I have a 5770 it's like that's great
but a 5770 is going to get absolutely
curb stomped by gtx460 so the reason
that we took the G that we took a lower
end processor in this case a dual core
or if you get the performance package of
quad core and paired it up with a
high-end GPU is in games running at HD
resolutions or higher even you always
get more benefit from a premium graphics
card than you would necessarily from
more cores on your cpu especially with
current games now if you're moving
forward yeah you probably want to have a
quad core but if you're just thinking in
terms in the next couple of years a dual
cores are going to be sufficient for
sure anyway this is the little odd that
you can see if you navigate to it the
other way so that's if you click the
little link on the right hand side of
the page NCIX pc desta 3050 gaming
systems you get dropped on this page
where it actually talks about some of
the other cool things for example it
comes with a free starcraft 2 trial it
comes with a copy of Metro 2033 it comes
with a copy of just cause 2 and that's
both of the packages come with all those
games and game trials because starcraft
2 is a trial it's silent so you can I
guess you if you want to do you could
click the links here to see the other
videos we already did and then you can
see the Vantage run that we did on the
base package where it scores about
14,000 points he
there's a little thing where you can
mouse over and see all of the special
call out features that we're talking
about I mean this is mostly about how
it's silent and how you're getting high
gaming performance out of either of
these two machines for the dollar and
then there's a couple other things down
here so you can add a 3d vision bundle
so it's actually a 3d vision ready with
the single card and then it's even 3d
vision surround ready if you have two
gtx 460 s in here so you can see back
there you've got all four DVI outputs
that you would need to run 3d vision
surround and then you've got a logitech
gaming bundle if you need a keyboard and
mouse and then you can also throw off as
2010 on there if you have the need for
that because remember these are for
back-to-school right so you need office
because you're doing lots of work on
your computer that is clearly a work
computer thanks for checking out my
video blog and I hope you've enjoyed it
oh yeah I should probably also say if
you actually click on either of these
links it takes you to our PC builder
where you can make any changes you want
so you can pick a different color case
although the special pricing only
applies to the default config so if
you're going to change anything you
probably want to you know bear in mind
that you're going to be paying a little
bit more because these are priced very
aggressively with the components that
we've selected so you can upgrade to
eight gigs of ram you can you can change
to one gig series video cards if you
want any way you can play around with it
get it exactly the way you want it and
then all you have to do is check out
pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
