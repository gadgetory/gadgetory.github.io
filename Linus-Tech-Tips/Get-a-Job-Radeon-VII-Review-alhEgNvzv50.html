bad for you for ten years you've had to
give your hard-earned money to either
Intel or Nvidia or both if you wanted to
build a top-of-the-line gaming r8 AMD
just hasn't been able to get both their
CPU and GPU business units firing at the
same time but perhaps that all changes
today
AMD stunned the industry as a whole when
they unveiled their GeForce RTX
competitor the Radeon seven one month
ago and then they stunned me in
particular when it arrived in our office
on time for their target launch date of
February 7th it isn't it beautiful it is
and it's got RGB but is it good enough
to pressure Nvidia to lower their higher
than ever prices for enthusiast gaming
GPUs well we'll find out soon thanks to
war thunder the realistic free-to-play
online game for sponsoring this video
check out the link below to get either a
premium tank or aircraft and three days
of premium play for free
let's begin with the bad news for those
of you who like living on the bleeding
edge AMD 7 nanometer Vega offering has
no support for ray tracing nor does it
have any kind of equivalent to invidious
deep learning optimized tensor course
now AMD has said that they're looking
into implementing something similar to D
LSS super sampling in the long term
using Microsoft's new direct ml API but
only time will tell if they get that
done and what kind of performance hit
we'd be looking at what we've got here
is actually if you look closely it's
right in the name basically a die shrunk
and optimized Vegas sequel but that's
not necessarily a bad thing let's take a
closer look right out of the gate it's
clear that AMD considers cooling to be
of the utmost importance while the
previous gen Vegas 64 used a blower
design the Radeon 7 3 cooling fans on a
large not to mention heavy vapor chamber
cooler just like it to our TX
competitors speaking of which not only
as the Radeon 7/8 taller card than the
RT X 2080 that AMD has positioned it
against it's also got twin 8 pin PCI
Express power connectors to allow it to
suck up more juice come to think of it
that's kind of weird normally die
shrinks come with a power savings ah
right so as far as we can tell they
basically put their entire power budget
savings towards cranking the clock
speeds up on this thing interesting so
ok then an overclocked and evolved Vega
I can dig it did they do anything else
to differentiate it from last gen oh
right yeah they did how does double the
HBM 2 memory at double the bandwidth
sound to put that into perspective the
Radeon 7 has faster memory than any of
the GTX Titans or r-tx Titans for that
matter but will that massive memory
bandwidth and significant core clock
increase make up for the loss of a
handful of stream processors and will
its resulting overall performance make
up for the lack of rate
singer/dancer course at this price to
find out we've brought out both our
Intel and AMD gaming test benches to pit
it head-to-head against not only the
r-tx twenty eighty and twenty atti but
also the Vegas 64 to see just what
impact those compromises had on the
cards performance so as is tradition by
now AMD seems to do worse and DirectX 11
titles than Nvidia but maintains an edge
or trades blows with team green whenever
DirectX 12 is in play which extends to
Far Cry 5 and especially csgo where our
RTX 2080 gets beaten by a pretty
significant margin when we throw
synthetics into the mix we see a
reversal of the DirectX 11 and 12
performance from earlier which come to
think of it is why we stopped using
synthetic benchmarks years ago I mean
this isn't even this isn't even
representative of real-world performance
Anthony was the one who brought them
back I think I'm gonna have a word with
them when we're done this video about
just killing them again once and for all
anyway moving on to productivity we've
got more tradition with AMD's Radeon
seven-pole ahead of even the 2080 ti in
longer blender renders while falling far
behind in v-ray in Lux mark the seventh
straight up embarrasses Nvidia across
the board but then inspect view perf
which gives us a broader look at its
workstation chops we've got a game of
leapfrog going on
so workloads that are particularly
memory hungry like katiya energy medical
and siemens NX show pretty strong wins
for AMD but in some cases again eclipse
even the 2080 ti while nvidia takes the
crown in workloads that require raw
compute strength sometimes again by
broad margins when we look at thermals
things get a little interesting now
traditionally GPU temperatures are
measured by a sensor at the edge of the
die and this is the temperature we're
showing you guys right now but AMD has
actually doubled the number of sensors
on the radio in seven and both the fan
speed and boost controls are mated to
what they're calling the junction
temperature with a target of 110 degrees
Celsius so the TLDR then is that the
junction is
highest reading out of all 64 sensors
and they claim that by doing things this
way they can squeeze more efficiency out
of the GPU unfortunately that also means
that the fans begin to ramp up much
sooner than you might be used to at a
junction temperature of 95 degrees and
he does say though that you can increase
this to 105 in their wot man software
without any risk of damaging the card
speaking of wot men we found that we
couldn't really push the core clocks up
at all without running into issues with
either early thermal throttling or
general instability so this supports our
pre overclocked hypothesis but we will
have to wait for more mature drivers and
for partner boards with more robust
power delivery before we can say
anything conclusively so verdict time
then given our results and the Radeon
seven 700 dollar price tag we're kind of
inclined to agree with Nvidia CEO and
curiously dr. Lisa Seussical Jenson
Huang it's a bit underwhelming yes for
the same price as a reference RT X 2080
you get similar performance in
traditional games but and videos overall
feature set is simply more robust maybe
you don't care about real time rate
racing or maybe you don't care about
GeForce experience or maybe you don't
care about Nvidia superior Hardware
h.264 encoder but take it all together
odds are you'll care about at least one
of invidious features so in our minds
then the Radeon 7
to beat the RT X xx 80s price not match
it and the frustrating thing is that if
it weren't for the massive HBM 2 frame
buffer they probably could have the word
on the street is that just shy of half
of the cost of this card is in that 16
gigs of memory that depending on the
game might never be utilized more than
75% now if we had to guess we'd say what
probably happened here was that rather
than re-engineering a gaming tuned card
with eight or twelve gigs of memory and
I don't know more stream processors or
something am
recycled their enterprise compute card
the radio and instinct mi 50 which would
also explain the excellent productivity
numbers
whatever the reason though that
compromise means that while the Radeon
seven is an excellent maybe even ideal
card for content creators by day gamers
by night or really anyone who uses
OpenCL a fair bit the value proposition
against team green is merely okay for
peer gamers don't get me wrong this
gives us a choice in the market for sure
and I'm I'm super glad that AMD released
it today it's just not quite the price
or performance disrupter that we were
all hoping for in the wake of invidious
stiff r-tx tax and as it stands it looks
like we're just gonna have to live with
