manufacturers approach their design in
one of a handful of ways sacrificing
weight and size to the performance gods
or delivering the best possible spec for
a killer student-friendly price features
and build quality be damned for example
but I don't think I have ever seen a
computer with this kind of laser-like
focus meet the LG Graham a 15 inch
notebook designed to be as light as
possible so light in fact that I can
hold it up by the corner with two
fingers cooler masters master case maker
5 features their freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description so let's begin then I
suppose with the tour of the device the
outer shell is made out of blasted
magnesium a metal in the same family as
lithium and one of the lightest on the
periodic table
with a subtle champagne finish that both
looks good and does an amazing job of
repelling fingerprints they absolutely
nailed this the material choice is a big
part of what gives the ground its
astonishingly low curb weight and it
comes with some other advantages as well
it still feels like metal when you touch
it giving it a more premium feel than a
plastic notebook can achieve but it
warms up almost as fast as plastic with
the heat of your hands no more cold
wrist rest first thing in the morning
and it's excellent heat conductivity
means that the ground runs fanless Li
until it's seen about a minute and a
half of sustained load at which time
those two tiny vents near the screen
hinge are called into action to keep
that dual core hyper threaded core i7
6500 you cool and all of this is at very
reasonable temperatures and barely
audible noise levels so then you're
probably asking yourself at this point
why doesn't magnesium get used more
often if it's so awesome well it's not
the first time I've seen it done to be
clear I remember oddly a Panasonic
Toughbook in my local
London drugs in the mid 2000s but
magnesium comes with some baggage it's
really really malleable so it takes some
clever alloying with other metals and
structural reinforcement in order to
achieve even the strength that you see
here with the mushy wrist rests and
screen that can be bent to a subtle
curve then straightened again without
much force at all but LG apparently
thought that this R&amp;amp;D work and
ruggedness compromise was worth it
because they looked at competitors like
Apple who seems to be going as far as to
treat their thin and light models like
track cars and thought there must be
another way because the grab has ports
on the left you'll find a power plug
that I wish was a little more robust or
even magnetic USB three HDMI and a Type
C USB 3 port though it's unfortunately
not equipped with Thunderbolt then on
the right you'll find USB to USB 3 again
a headphone microphone combo jack and a
bit of an odd one a microSD slot I mean
don't get me wrong it's better than
nothing but the number of times I found
myself thinking gosh I sure wish I had a
micro SD reader on my laptop can easily
be counted on one hand while an SD slot
which can be easily adapted to micro
would have probably been worth the extra
couple of grams to me but would there
have even been room so my signature
edition model sports 8 gigs of ddr3 L
memory a 512 gig samsung PM 871 SATA
based and dot 2 SSD and intel AC
wireless 7265 wireless module and a 44
95 milliamp hour battery that LG
advertises as being capable of 7 hours
of use but in practice like pretty much
all laptops it only hits that kind of a
number when it's used in airplane mode
with the screen dimmed all the way
something I normally don't test but I
was actually stuck on dark buses for
hours with this thing so yeah the
standardized PC mark battery test I
usually run gave the Graeme respectable
but less impressive score and the thing
to remember here is that is in spite of
the non benchmark shattering do
cool core processor a more normal
15-inch laptop you might look at and go
well it lasts for a similar amount of
time but that one will do much more in
that battery time if you're looking to
tackle heavier tasks like working in
Photoshop or light video editing while
you're on the go but that normal laptop
probably won't have such an interesting
form factor let's take a look at the
screen the bezels are impressively thin
meaning that the Graham is going to be
smaller in almost every dimension then
other devices rocking a 15-inch matte
finish IPS display now the 1920 by 1080
resolution with no upgrade options might
raise some eyebrows in the age of 3k and
4k notebook screens but honestly it
doesn't bother me at 15 inches I agree
with LG's choice to salvage some battery
life or allow me to run the backlight a
little bit brighter as a trade-off for
that extra resolution which isn't to say
though that I agree with every trade-off
they've made presumably to save on
weight the webcam has been put in that
horrible unflattering position below the
screen on the bottom bezel which is a
shame because otherwise the image
quality and sound is pretty good and the
keyboard oh the keyboard
okay positive things first the tactile
feedback considering the z-depth that is
the thickness of the laptop is not bad
and the keystrokes are very quiet for
working on your novel in the local
Starbucks without disturbing the other
patrons but I think it would take me a
very long time using only this machine
to get used to some of its
eccentricities like the layout of the
three column number pad and the
proximity of the arrow keys to the
spacebar and in this day and age I
understand that weight savings was the
name of the game here a non backlit
keyboard is a total drag the good news
is that having a number pet is something
that a lot of people will find very
valuable and the click pad is pretty
good with 200 operation only sometimes
glitching out and tracking feeling
responsive and accurate leading us then
nicely to I guess the final summary
there are things that laptop shoppers
will like and there are things that they
will dislike about the gram no device is
perfect unexceptional battery life
tablet like performance no touchscreen
and lackluster ruggedness are low points
I mean I seriously I wouldn't even put
this thing in an overstuffed backpack
for fear that it would bend but the good
if not high resolution IPS screen
complete lack of junk where steam and
Ida were installed by me loud enough
speakers standout aesthetics one finger
hinge which blew me away given how light
this thing is and of course the overall
weight of the device are enough for me
to even if I can't give it an
unconditional bye now recomendation
feel the need to congratulate LG on
their achievement here in a sea of
devices that seek to strike a balance
between battery performance price etc
and all end up being pretty much the
same damn thing for it LG's Graham team
had a unique vision and saw it through
that is what makes people pretty much
universally including myself say wow
this thing is cool when they hold it for
the first time so I've got to give them
mad props for that the device they built
is unlike anything else and if you want
a big screen on a notebook that you'll
hardly even realize you're carrying then
look no further because nothing else
nails this quite like the Graham and on
the subject of extremely unique products
this is a funny one that mass drops
featuring this is the red scarf 2 plus
version B custom mechanical keyboard kit
so this is a build-it-yourself
mechanical keyboard kit featuring a
unique 78 key layout it consists of a
PCB clear acrylic bottom and a CNC
aluminum case plate and feet this allows
for customization of lighting layout
including ISO and ANSI and Colour the Rs
78 is fully programmable allowing users
to utilize the unique layout as they see
fit and there's a variety of choices of
Dyess aluminum color comes in black gray
red or silver you can also add a set of
standards lay out blank or laser etched
front printed PVD keycaps in cherry
profile and the lighting can be
controlled via a remote check out it and
any of the other awesome products on
mass drop where they just find
manufacturers who are willing to give a
volume discount and a lot of consumers
who are committed to buy and they put
them together and they get awesome
prices on some very unique products all
the way from camping gear to build it
