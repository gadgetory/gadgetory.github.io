look at kind of a neat product from benq
it's the joy p-gp one mini projector and
I guess the first thing I apologize I'm
not unboxing it today it's already set
up so I'll just show you a quick
overview of the accessories that comes
with first it comes with a remote take
special note that the top buttons are
for the projector and the bottom buttons
are for the card reader that's going to
come in handy when you're trying to
control this thing oh I knocked it oh
well never ok it comes with a little
case that houses the projector itself
but not the not the AC adapter so it's
kind of not quite there yet you'll need
another another holder if you want to
hold the whole thing so inside the box I
actually haven't even looked at what's
in here it's probably a manual and
probably ok so you've got a user's
manual on a disc then you have a quick
oh this is Kennedy you have a quick
little chart that shows you what formats
are supported what resolution is
supported so ntsc goes up to 720 x 480
and that seems to be the highest
resolution supported by the GP one okay
you've got your warranty information
card your safety manual you know safety
is important when you're projecting
things at a wall then there's something
else in here yeah there we go ok so this
is a quick start guide so there is the
quick start guide for the joy be so the
thing i have it set up with right now is
with the USB card reader so i'm going to
go ahead and use my little remote here
to show you that i can show you pictures
ok these aren't particularly great
pictures i apologize for that basically
it's a ok select there now we'll play
back my pictures i'm going to turn down
the lights so you can get a better
the joy be here is capable of okay I'm
going to go turn off the other light as
well and then I'm going to skip ahead to
the next picture there we go so you can
see that in the dark and I hope you can
see that yeah you can see that in the
dark the joy v is actually quite quite
bright and I can make Shadow Puppets
okay so this is my first attempt at UV
lighting in a computer you can see that
I wasn't quite there yet and the other
one is my parents can't Batman wearing a
Christmas hat so he's quite enjoying
that as you can see now that's not all
the joy be can do I mean first of all
again I haven't even showed you them
here come look at the projector okay so
you have buttons to control the
projector up on the top these are all
touch sensitive buttons maybe what
touched when I hope I didn't do anything
okay and then you have a focus wheel
right here which was quite easy to dial
it in terms of inputs you've got the
power input on this side and I can you
see that enough okay good and then you
have a USB port on the back which is
where I'm viewing these photos off of
and you can also read video then at the
back you have a little proprietary port
here which is good for a composite as
well as vga in which I have plugged in
right now and then there's pretty much
nothing on the other side can you come
around and have a quick look at the
front of the unit here I realize it
might be a little bit bright but there
you go you've got like a white finish
and the fed is a little bit loud the
exhaust comes out the front and it's a
touch loud but it's not going to be too
obnoxious if you're giving a
presentation or whatever else it is
you're doing now in terms of the other
mode here I've got it hooked up to my
laptop so if you were into okay so I'm
going to pick a source oh yeah and
there's a coming support for an ipod
dock which is kind of cool so you can
either use up went away so you can
either use vga composite the USB reader
or an ipod dock so i'm going to select
this one enter do all signal searching
and there we go we got warcraft 3 so on
the pc it says the max supported
resolution is 800 x
600 and you wait I think that pretty
much concludes it thank you for checking
out my unboxing are wide and really
unboxing thank you for checking out my
product showcase of the benq joy be gp1
so one thing that we didn't really tell
actually two things we didn't really
talk about three things first of all the
joy bgp one has built-in speakers there
only two wat but they are there in case
you need them for the composite input
another thing is how big of an image can
you get out of it well you can see we
have a very bright very satisfying image
right now it's a a boat yeah I guess
it's about 33 something feet tall ok and
then however many feet wide and wheres
to be still got our warcraft 3 running
the colors are quite vivid and i am
actually looking forward to playing
around with this with some gaming test
particularly driving games thank you for
checking out my video blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
