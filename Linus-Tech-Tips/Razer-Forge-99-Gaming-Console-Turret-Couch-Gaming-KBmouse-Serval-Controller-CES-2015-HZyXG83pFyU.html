brought to you by phantom glass visit
store phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so our second video here at
the razor suite is also one where I look
at the future as a little bit cloudy but
I definitely believe in the premise here
this is the forge TV it's got a Qualcomm
805 quad core processor it's got an
Adreno 420 GPU so you can expect your
frame rates to be high it's got Gigabit
Ethernet HDMI out USB it's got wireless
AC it's got bluetooth connectivity it
actually supports Wi-Fi controllers as
well and it comes in at $99 but this
isn't the first time we've seen an
Android based gaming console and what is
raised are going to bring to the table
that they think is going to make this
compete with well any other Android
device that you can plug into your TV
whether it's from a small you know
company that you've never heard of
before or whether it's from someone like
in video with their shield line of
tablets and gaming devices well number
one is going to be the price $99.99 is
going to be pretty appealing for
something with these kinds of specs
where you're at the point where you can
run pretty much any Android game
extremely smoothly even at 1080p 60fps
number two is going to be of course the
ecosystem raisers never one to release
just one product they want you to buy
like this and then they want you to buy
the controller for it and the you know
the keyboard and mouse thing that goes
along with it and these I'll start with
this one because it's actually really
cool this is called the turret and it's
a keyboard mouse combo that comes with a
little dock maybe that's where it got
the turret name and the idea is to
address the problem that any PC gamers
who also want to enjoy content on their
big screen tend to have which is how on
earth do I control a game like
civilization if I'm going to play on my
TV we've seen solutions in the past like
the couch master is one that we actually
reviewed that I kind of went yeah this
works really well but it's extremely
bulky and you're not going to be you
know I'm pressing your lady friend that
you bring over by having one of those
next to your TV this is a little bit
more elegant so instead of having a huge
cushion that sits across your lap the
keyboard itself for the turret on full
folds into a mousepad and then the mouse
itself is actually very thoughtfully
designed so it's got its gets slippy
pads all around the outside so that even
if you're right at the very edge of that
mousepad it is still functional until
the mouse is hanging more than about 1/4
to 1/3 off the edge of the pad making
the mousepad
effectively much larger than it actually
looks it's nice little touches like that
but I appreciate from Razer the cost for
this one I actually don't know what's
that one going to run you 149 I'm
guessing
129 all right well they impressed me
because the overall build quality vac
chewy feels very very solid now this one
is where they kind of got away from me a
little bit this is their new controller
actually very very beautiful piece of
hardware I mean we've come to expect
this razer doesn't exactly do the whole
you know 1999 controller thing so you've
got those whatever they call them hyper
response buttons I call them hair
trigger buttons we can call them
whatever they want they have a really
nice tactile feel to them
you've got Android buttons built in for
Android navigation it is intended to be
used with the forge TV but this one is
going to come at a bit of a price so
this is an $80 controller but this comes
with their streaming software that's
going to be built into cortex so now
instead of being locked into well we
shouldn't say locked into because there
are other solutions but instead of being
locked into in videos game stream you
are going to be able to use razors poor
tech software in order to stream games
from your PC so they've actually got it
running right now and while I can't say
the latency is very impressive they tell
me that behind the scenes most of the
work that goes into something like this
is actually really on the codecs side
they're not using h.264 they're not
using h.265 they're actually using a
proprietary codec that they believe in
the long term is going to give them
better latency and better image quality
compared to other solutions also this is
another cool thing it's sided well I
don't know depending on how you look at
it oh I unplugged this fortunately wait
what I thought it was running oh no it
must not because this doesn't have an
HDMI out running to it okay well
whatever there was a green light on it
now there isn't um good news the lights
back on and I cannot finish up that
thought where I left off so the good
news is that you are going to be able to
use third-party controllers whether
they're blue 2
or Wi-Fi direct which is great because
you know if you want to be that guy who
has the one nice controller for himself
and then like the crummy controllers for
all of his buddies then hey you can be
that guy but the bad news is that if you
want to take advantage of their
end-to-end latency optimizations you are
going to benefit from the firmware
upgrades and tweaks that Razer is
putting into their own controller for
the best most low latency possible
experience in line with that sort of
open attitude whole thing that they've
got going on in their suite today is
that unlike nvidia game stream or even
limelight for that matter you are not
going to be locked into an Nvidia
graphics card to run this so AMD Radeon
owners rejoice that is to say as long as
they improve the latency a fair bit over
what they're doing now because I'm gonna
I'm going to go ahead and I'm just going
to like be that guy who shows how far
off we are right now although the beta
doesn't even start for another couple of
months and they've got what was it 10
million users you guys are rolling out
the beta to to to test this out for you
guys anyone with cortex ultimately 10
million current users so hopefully that
gives them a little bit of feedback and
helps them turn this thing into
something that totally kicks ass I do
believe in game streaming I do believe
in Android as the next gaming platform
so whether I believe that Razer is going
to be the one to to crack that egg or
it's going to be someone else I'm glad
they're throwing their hat into the ring
because this is a very beautiful little
piece of hardware they actually had the
same team that worked on blade do this
so it shouldn't be surprising to anyone
that I think it's the bee's knees
alright guys thanks for checking out
video number two here in the Razer suite
don't miss any of our CES content and
remember our trip to the show this year
was powered by phantom glass visit store
phantom glass for what is in my mind the
best screen protecting option you can
get for your smartphone is Gorilla Glass
which means it's nice and clear it's got
that nice feel unlike those plastic ones
it works with third-party cases just
like the one that I have on here right
now and it's very very easy to apply
without getting any bubbles under
whatsoever in fact I'd say it's hard to
get bubbles under it also sponsoring our
shift is HyperX so you want to check out
youtube.com slash HyperX for great
gaming content we've got links to both
of those guys in the video description
below also make sure you subscribe so
you don't miss any of our CES videos
