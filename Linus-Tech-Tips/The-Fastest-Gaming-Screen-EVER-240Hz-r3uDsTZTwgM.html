this video from CES 2017 build your
online store or website at the link in
the video description um what what what
is it it's like that it's like I got
this guy watching me while I try and
make my video here it's weirding me out
but that's okay because nothing can ruin
my mood right now okay monitors used to
be 60 Hertz and then we got overclocking
to like 75 85 then we got 120 Hertz
night and day difference then a couple
incremental improvements 144 165 now
it's game changing again and by game I
mean gaming ah yes this is the rog swift
PG 258 q the first 240 hertz 24 and a
half inch gaming monitor that I have had
the pleasure of laying my eyes on and
holy cow just sitting down and knocking
things over and moving the mouse it is
immediately noticeable and it's not like
necessarily some other high refresh rate
monitors out there because even without
ultra-low motion blur enabled this thing
is actually doing pretty darn well in
terms of not leaving motion trails
behind the cursor now obviously I don't
have it in the lab yet but I've been
informed we will be getting one very
soon but my initial impression is this
is freaking impressive so it features
Nvidia g-sync technology you've got to
DisplayPort in or HDMI in whichever you
prefer and it's got a built-in USB 3 hub
in terms of the styling it's what has
become kind of the ROG way so you've got
a nice slim bezel a couple kind of gamer
II accents but the most sort of let's
say gaudy how you say of which the
underglow ROG logo thing you can turn
that off in the menu now those of you
who are wondering it does support g-sync
but the unanimous opinion from the Asus
guys in the room is that the real story
here is not necessarily
g-sync but rather the fact that now if
you turn g-sync off you can run
ultra-low motion blur all the way up to
the full 240 Hertz which is going to
give you like super sharp fast moving
images at an extremely high refresh rate
which is going to be critical for
competitive gamers or filthy casuals
like me who just like having the best
possible experience even though they
suck it's got the full range of
adjustments and as we're making all
these adjustments to the stand you'll
probably notice yes this is in fact a TN
panel but I got to tell you guys outside
of looking at it from the bottom where
it really it does look awful side to
side viewing angles very good and colors
again just subjectively I'm just at a
show looking pretty good here I am super
excited about this one that is to say as
long as I can afford the approximately
$500 price tag I never said the
resolution okay hold on we think for a
second did I miss anything else critical
you know what let's just let's just do a
totally awkward shot here um it's a
1080p monitor I forgot to mention the
resolution anyway thanks for checking
out our video you guys don't forget to
get subscribed to Linus tech tip so you
don't miss any of our CES coverage and a
huge shout out to Squarespace I believe
there are talking points in my pocket
but come on
realistically do I not know how to pitch
you guys Squarespace Squarespace is the
place to go if you want to build a
beautiful website that works great
across a wide variety of devices whether
you want to view them at 60 Hertz on the
phone in your pocket or at 240 freaking
Hertz on the monitor at your desktop
Squarespace has built-in commerce and it
is so easy to use that even I can make
changes to our Squarespace website which
is quite an achievement so check it out
we've got it at the link in the video
description you can get a free trial and
you can save I believe it's ten percent
hot dang I didn't know everything off
the top of my head but I believe it's
ten percent by using our link down there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
