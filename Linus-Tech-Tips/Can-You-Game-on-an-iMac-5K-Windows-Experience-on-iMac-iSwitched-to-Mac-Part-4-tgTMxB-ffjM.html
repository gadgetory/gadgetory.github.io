using the iMac with Windows and a
top-tier mobile graphics card
performance showdown with the Radeon r9
M 295 X
yes actually eight gig versus Nvidia as
king of the hill gtx 980m mobile as
separate videos but my wife and the rest
of the internet complains that we've
been doing too many multi-part episodes
so here they are together you won this
battle but not the teaser battle my GS
30 stealth external graphics card
notebook review is coming soon
experienced silent performance with the
new Coolermaster Silencio 652 s
minimalist design maximum compatibility
click now to learn more
so boot camp is frickin awesome
you just spotlight search boot camp
assistant pop in a USB thumb drive
pointed out an ISO then it walks you
through resizing your OS 10 partition
creating a Windows one and then without
any pre boo FA nonsense
it runs the setup process all the while
restarting automatically into the
correct thing then finally you land on
the Windows desktop you're prompted to
install all the necessary drivers from
one executable it reboots again and boom
you are ready to rock the experience is
so seamless compared to when I've dual
booted in the past although admittedly
it's been a while I have so many drives
that I rarely see the point in
partitioning for multiple OS is except
in cases where the extremely limited
upgrade ability of a particular machine
forces me to do it now I've had a lot of
people ask me to comment on what it's
like to run Windows on a Mac and frankly
I don't know what they were expecting
Mac's are not made of dragon scales and
the force or whatever so it's exactly
the same as running Windows on a PC with
the same specs as that Mac I cannot
stress this enough there is nothing
about an AK that makes it special
other than subjectively beautiful
industrial design driver validation and
component quality control are arguably
important things but they don't affect
performance oh and I guess there's a
little boot camp doodad in the system
tray that lets you reboot directly to OS
10 if you want now the astute among you
may have noticed that asterisk on the
exactly about 40 seconds ago
what was that thrown in there for well a
couple of reasons first and foremost is
that for anything to perform exactly the
same it has to not be hamstrung on a
normal PC with a separate tower and
monitor 49 70 K will typically operate
it anywhere from 4 gigahertz to 4.4
gigahertz depending on how
multi-threaded a workload you're
throwing at it thanks to turbo boost
which you can learn more about here on
the iMac thanks to the quiet but not
particularly powerful cooling system
that CPU idles around 50 degrees ramps
up to 80 degrees and under
and seconds then in spite of the fin
ramping up aggressively at 30 seconds
begins to thermal throttle at 40 seconds
hits a hundred degrees at 50 seconds and
stays there operating anywhere between
three point six to four gigahertz with a
multi-threaded workload about a five to
fifteen percent reduction in the
performance that CPU could achieve in
something like you know multi-core video
rendering if it had a better cooler it
really raises the question why did Apple
bother to give users the option of a top
tier chip like this when it was never
going to reach its rated speeds when it
matters most anyway the other reason my
asterisk was put in there is something
that I was very very very disappointed
by not a lot of these 5ki Macs are out
there in the wild even fewer of them are
running Windows so there wasn't a ton of
information about that what I'm doing
here and I had to discover for myself
that thanks to some combination are they
in these driver AMD's hardware and
Apple's custom timing controller that
enabled them to deliver a 5k single tile
display in Windows you will be limited
to 4k resolution Macs
so that's 3840 by 2160 on your 50 120 by
2880 display something that doesn't seem
to be bothering this fella in the apple
community discussion thread where folks
are saying they've been bounced around
between Apple and AMD and at one point
someone says he or she was told to talk
to Microsoft about it but it bothers me
a lot thanks to the much higher
resolution than normal and much higher
pixel density than normal of this
display the approximations that come
along with any non native resolution
operation of a monitor and LCD monitor
to be specific can be more accurate than
the otherwise would be but there is
still discoloration and blurriness on
text that makes everything look a little
fuzzy what a disappointment so the only
real new information I have since my
previous videos on the 27-inch retina 5k
iMac is that it thermal throttles while
performing CPU intensive tasks seemingly
by design since out
avoids ramping the cooling fan up for as
long as it can before finally giving in
and cooling that poor CPU and it cannot
run its display at 5k in a native
Windows environment which coupled with
the fact that it also can't be driven as
an external display on another PC or Mac
makes this machine optimal for very
specific people so with that mini
conclusion out of the way we can move on
to the next segment of this video the
performance of the r9 m 295 X and it is
g TX 980 m first a bit about the m2 95 X
a GPU that has only shown up in this
iMac in its top tier configuration so
far to my knowledge along sir someone in
the comments will correct me if I'm
wrong it's based on the same Tonga
architecture as a desktop r9 285 but
with 14% more stream processors and
texture units and an 8 percent reduction
in core clock with the same 256-bit
memory bus but in the case of this
computer anyway it features a massive 8
gig frame buffer versus the 2gig one on
its closest desktop equivalent
presumably because Apple felt it needed
it to drive the retina imax 5k display
not that it kept OS 10 Yosemite from
frequently stuttering while switching
desktops are using Mission Control
anyway but today's video was not about
running the iMac in Windows anyhow we're
jerky animations by the way were a
non-issue until I fired up some games I
tried the game at 4k to at least get
some of what I paid for out of the
machine but outside of casual games like
League of Legends dota 2 and Team
Fortress 2 which by the way ran fine I
suspect most people will end up turning
the system down to 1440p or even 1080p
the good news is that if you want to
game on the iMac some fairly demanding
games can be run if you're okay with
reducing your resolution Crysis 3 on
median details hovered around the 50 to
60 FPS range with 2x msaa and while it
was pretty weird for lack of a better
word sitting there gaming on an iMac
it's got more horses than I think a lot
of people give it credit for which isn't
to say that the r9m 295 X was in
I mind the best choice for this machine
while it unfortunately wasn't quite
released when the system launched I'd
love to see the 5k iMac updated with a
gtx 980m option instead in our 1080p
benchmarks the nine ATM which is based
on the same GM 204 Maxwell Korres
Nvidia's desktop flagship TTX 980
absolutely crushes I mean these top tier
mobile GPU in spite of the fact that I
ran my benchmarks for the nine ATM on an
msi gt80 Titan laptop whose core i7
mobile processor was running about 10%
slower than the IMAX throttled 49 70 K
in games so I think that's it I'm done
with the imac for good now it was fun
while it lasted I think I've had all the
experiences that I care to have with it
guys I hope you've had all the
experiences you care to have a thick cuz
this is it
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment if
you hate multi-part episodes and as
always there's a link in the video

you can buy a cool t-shirt like this one
give us a monthly contribution or change
your bookmark for Amazon to one with our
affiliate code so every time you buy an
iMac or a dry erase marker or whatever
else it is you buy on Amazon we get a
small kickback that kind of thing helps
