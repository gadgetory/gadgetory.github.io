using the iMac with Windows and a
top-tier mobile graphics card
performance showdown with the Radeon r9
M - 95 X 8 gig yes actually 8 gig versus
in videos Kenya hell gtx 980m mobile as
separate videos but my wife and the rest
of the internet complains that we've
been doing too many multi-part episodes
so here they are together you won this
battle but not the teaser battle my GS
30 stealth external graphics card
notebook reviews coming soon experience
silent performance with the new
Coolermaster Silencio 652 s minimalist
design maximum compatibility click now
to learn more
so boot camp is frickin awesome
you just spotlight search boot camp
assistant pop in a USB thumb drive
pointed out an ISO then it walks you
through resizing your OS 10 partition
creating a Windows one and then without
any pre-boot f8
nonsense it runs the setup process all
the while restarting automatically into
the correct thing then finally you land
on the Windows desktop you're prompted
to install all the necessary drivers
from one executable it reboots again and
boom you are ready to rock the
experience is so seamless compared to
when I dual boot it in the past although
admittedly it's been a while I have so
many drives that I rarely see the point
in partitioning for multiple OS is
except in cases where the extremely
limited upgrade ability of a particular
machine forces me to do it now I've had
a lot of people ask me to comment on
what it's like to run Windows on a Mac
and frankly I don't know what they were
expecting Mac's are not made of dragon
scales and the force or whatever so it's
exactly the same as running Windows on a
PC with the same specs as that Mac I
cannot stress this enough there is
nothing about an AK that makes it
special
other than subjectively beautiful
industrial design driver validation and
component quality control are arguably
important things but they don't affect
performance oh and I guess there's a
little boot camp doodad in the system
tray that lets you reboot directly to OS
10 if you want now the astute among you
may have noticed that asterisk on the
exactly about 40 seconds ago what was
that thrown in there for well a couple
of reasons first and foremost is that
for anything to perform exactly the same
it has to not be hamstrung on a normal
PC with a separate tower and monitor 49
70 K will typically operate it anywhere
from 4 gigahertz to 4.4 gigahertz
depending on how multi-threaded a
workload you're throwing at it thanks to
turbo boost which you can learn more
about here on the iMac thanks to the
quiet but not particularly powerful
cooling system that CPU idles around 50
degrees ramps up to 80 degrees in under
10
seconds then in spite of the fin ramping
up aggressively at 30 seconds begins to
thermal throttle at 40 seconds hits a
hundred degrees at fifty seconds and
stays there operating anywhere between
three point six to four gigahertz with a
multi-threaded workload about a five to
fifteen percent reduction in the
performance that CPU could achieve in
something like you know multi-core video
rendering if it had a better cooler it
really raises the question why did Apple
bother to give users the option of a top
tier chip like this when it was never
going to reach its rated speeds when it
matters most anyway the other reason my
asterisk was put in there is something
that I was very very very disappointed
by not a lot of these 5ki Macs are out
there in the wild even fewer of them are
running Windows so there wasn't a ton of
information about that what I'm doing
here and I had to discover for myself
that thanks to some combination of AMD's
driver and ease Hardware and apples
custom timing controller that enabled
them to deliver a 5k single tile display
in Windows you will be limited to 4k
resolution max
so that's 3840 by 2160 on your 50 120 by
2880 display something that doesn't seem
to be bothering this fella in the Apple
community discussion thread where folks
are saying they've been bounced around
between Apple and AMD and at one point
someone says he or she was told to talk
to Microsoft about it but it bothers me
a lot thanks to the much higher
resolution than normal and much higher
pixel density than normal of this
display the approximations that come
along with any non native resolution
operation of a monitor and LCD monitor
to be specific can be more accurate than
the otherwise would be but there is
still discoloration and blurriness on
text that makes everything look a little
fuzzy what a disappointment so the only
real new information I have since my
previous videos on the 27-inch retina 5k
iMac is that it thermal throttles while
performing CPU intensive tasks seemingly
by design since Apple
avoids ramping the cooling fan up for as
long as it can before finally giving in
and cooling that poor CPU and it cannot
run its display at 5k in a native
Windows environment which coupled with
the fact that it also can't be driven as
an external display on another PC or Mac
makes this machine optimal for very
specific people so with that mini
conclusion out of the way we can move on
to the next segment of this video the
performance of the r9 295x2 x9 ATM first
a bit about the m2 95 X a GPU that has
only shown up in this iMac in its top
tier configuration so far to my
knowledge although I'm sure someone in
the comments will correct me if I'm
wrong it's based on the same Tonga
architecture as a desktop r9 285 but
with 14% more stream processors and
texture units and an 8 percent reduction
in core clock with the same 256-bit
memory bus but in the case of this
computer anyway it features a massive 8
gig frame buffer versus the 2gig one on
its closest desktop equivalent
presumably because Apple felt it needed
it to drive the retina imax 5k display
not that it kept OS 10 Yosemite from
frequently stuttering while switching
desktops are using Mission Control
anyway but today's video was not about
running the iMac in Windows anyhow we're
jerky animations by the way we're a
non-issue until I fired up some games I
tried the game at 4k to at least get
some of what I paid for out of the
machine but outside of casual games like
League of Legends dota 2 and Team
Fortress 2 which by the way ran fine I
suspect most people will end up turning
the system down to 1440p or even 1080p
the good news is that if you want to
game on the iMac some fairly demanding
games can be run if you're okay with
reducing your resolution Crysis 3 on
median details hovered around the 50 to
60 FPS range with 2x msaa and while it
was pretty weird for lack of a better
word sitting there gaming on an iMac
it's got more horses than I think a lot
of people give it credit for
which isn't to say that the r9m 295 X
was in
I mind the best choice for this machine
while it unfortunately wasn't quite
released when the system launched I'd
love to see the 5k iMac updated with a
gtx 980m option instead in our 1080p
benchmarks the nine ATM which is based
on the same GM 204 Maxwell corazon
videos desktop flagship gtx 980
absolutely crushes in these top tier
mobile GPU in spite of the fact that I
ran my benchmarks for the nine ATM on an
msi gt80 Titan laptop whose core i7
mobile processor was running about 10%
slower than the IMAX throttled 49 70 K
in games so I think that's it I'm done
with the imac for good now it was fun
while it lasted I think I've had all the
experiences that I care to have with it
guys I hope you've got all the
experiences you care to have with it
because this is it like this video if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it leave a comment if you hate
multi-part episodes and as always
there's a link in the video description
