disorganization getting things started
today we've had a bit of a honestly the
4 p.m. start time is a bit of a
challenge hard to hit um people are like
oh well why don't you just set
everything up and then it's already
there when you get back and I'm just
like you know we only have so many
cameras and microphones we have one yeah
one camera so when we take that camera
with us to shoot NCIX tech tips on
Fridays and when we go in early and try
and get all of our stuff done in time to
be back in time to live stream we
actually have to be roll dude he's like
playing with velcro straps over there do
we like audio crackling I'm like no just
b-roll no just be a roller spero you
know what you know I ok we have a ton of
topics today it's actually gonna be a
really good show but what I want to
start with is the level of holy crap
what is wrong with minuses life right
now because we are in the midst of a
bunch of projects so as you may or may
not know there may or may not be some
product launches coming up very soon
which makes a lot of sense because
computex is coming up soon we're gearing
up for that we've been preparing that
build guide that we launched last night
that apparently you guys loved which
just warms my heart of course but you
are not going to believe what my garage
and what my house looks like because
we're also moving in the next couple of
weeks yeah so there's all this stuff so
check this out check this out all right
I don't know what are we looking at all
right numbers around so my desk here
that people usually see on the set got
completely removed because this is where
the Intel build guide actually was so we
had to move my entire desk and
everything over into this corner which
is where we usually film tech quickies
and fast as possible but then that once
we finally moved my desk back can't also
be used for that because now we're using
it as a photo booth so
oh yeah right here I should show that so
there's the photobooth line it's too
chewy now so we we made like this little
photo booth thing on the floor so we can
take nice pictures of products yeah oh
we had to have this white thing on the
floor so we could do those pictures for
the little guy the white thing on the
floor is the pic when we did pictures
that in the pre-roll for the build guide
where lino sitting there and all this
chain is closed keep on changing like
crazy that's why we needed the weight on
the floor so we get a full body shot in
the back of background was consistent I
think he's gonna come all the way around
now here's the shelf where I put the
model m which is freaking awesome be
rolls kind of hiding over there there's
some awesome corsair showcase things
that we're going to be doing fairly soon
holy crap the year old Olinsky thing
cannot execute function because of the
conditions something bad is happening
not entirely true with that is really is
it because of the aperture don't know
it's normal everyone's very interested
in what you're not doing right now this
is the table that we filmed the build
guide on cuz I had to shove it over
there and bring all the stuff over there
so I could keep on working here's the
map on the Samsung there's the macbook
from the Samsung upgrade your Mac video
also in tech kooky and here's just a
whole bunch of stuff that we can't
really do anything with because we're
moving soon so there's no reason of to
actually properly organized it just more
it's stuff there's b-roll and we're
coming back so welcome to the insanely
disorganized room that is the entire
studio that is also known as Linus's
garage it looks like dye Mac died that's
why it's sitting on a very high unstable
point yeah probably dies i'll be
returning it at some point so whatever
of course we're not doing that first
what wait what what what are you talking
I don't know um honestly though okay so
you've seen my house right does this
even compared to what's going on at my
house no there's like a bed ready
yeah there's like the top mattress for a
bed just sitting on like the stairs
between his living room and his family
or his living room in his dining room
because in a video he had to like push
me and I had to go flying so instead of
falling on the stairs I was gonna fall
on like the top part of the mattress but
then that didn't actually get put back
so it's just kind of sitting there it's
just kind of there honestly it's amazing
my wife hasn't killed me like it is
amazing i think if we didn't have a plan
to move everything out you might be dead
i think that is quite lost only thing
keeping you alive is that promise that
it's all going away soon yeah and that
the garage will be salvaged back and
yeah we're really excited about moving
it's gonna be kind of awesome um-hmm so
anyways why don't we start okay so Steve
dotto our guest has been bumped again to
next week sorry about that and I wanted
to clarify something as well last week
we said the big bang theory had a laugh
track and we complained about how their
laugh track was stupid and we were wrong
big bang theory is filmed in front of a
live audience of hyenas so it honestly
like I hadn't I hadn't watched it okay
to be clear guys I love the big bang
theory I've seen every episode from the
first four seasons like at least three
or four times love Big Bang Theory do
not like the constant laughter I was
watching an episode last night one of
the newer ones and it's just like
someone walks in the room and it's like
hahaha why it's not funny yes it's live
audience laughter one thing we talked
about before was contagious laughter so
someone sees the person into the room
this is the first time they've seen that
actor they find that actor hilarious the
person enters the room they start
laughing at what else starts laughing ah
he did start laughing haha cuz you look
ridiculous there you go turns out it
works so uh yeah so are bad but that
really still doesn't change how I feel
about laugh track because you know what
like okay here example of of a show
where it was filmed in front of a live
audience but the laughter didn't detract
from it all in the family uh-oh watch TV
you're so young it's an old show it's a
classic watch TV ah anyway I want less
TV when I was a kid all in the family
filmed live amazing and you know what I
did okay you know you know what I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
getting you to get into this anymore why
don't we do a little bit of Twitter Q&amp;amp;A
sure logitech g7 10 plus vs corsair k90
5 just a comparison of the features not
the switches slick looking at you you
take that one you want me to take that
one it says not the switches you don't
even know the features do you that's why
I don't want to get really of the k95
okay well they came the k95 has some
cool stuff so you can turn all of the
keys on and off individually do you
remember seeing that at CES yeah so you
can do your zone lighting however you
want however logitech software is second
to none their gaming software is
outstanding they've been working on it
longer than anyone else I mean that's
another thing Corsairs has improved so
much so much since they first launched
the k90 in the k-6 t but you know large
attacks logitech um logitech i mean
they're both built well i'd say if
anything the k95 probably has a better
build feel to it just because of the
aluminum back plate but honestly saying
compare these mechanical keyboards and
don't talk about switches it's just sort
of like wrong someone says finally you
shaved good work it's coming back beard
is not staying away guaranteed beard is
coming back also one more thing to note
about the g7 10 plus is there's black Oh
rings under the key caps that they don't
yea vote but they are there and they're
very nice and it makes it quieter and
just sort of more better Hey oh it feels
really good but they don't really call
that out so just a heads up because
they're awesome my 3570k is hit TJ maxx
sometimes over a few times at one time
Richard is degradation occur degradation
is a function of temperature and voltage
and so basically if you're over voltage
to the point where you're reaching TJ
maxx i can pretty much tell you right
now your cpu is degrading in some way i
actually got a I got a message from
someone I used to work with at NCIX
who is no longer there and he was like
oh yeah my overclocks not working
anymore is it possible that it degraded
and it's like yeah it is real it does
happen my opteron 165 well first it
stopped overclocking as well and then it
stopped working entirely but I'm sort of
whole other thing but yeah degreat
degradation is real and it is best to
keep it at all reasonable temperature
this is why when I recommend running
prime95 and I say you know what 85
degrees is probably fine it's because
it's never going to be loaded like that
unless you're doing hardcore video
rendering or you know graphics work and
even then you render a job you output a
job and it's done these are consumer
grade devices they're designed for
consumer workloads where you load up a
game if you're priming at 85 degrees
you're gaming at 70 I can tell you that
much maybe not 70 but it's a lot lower
and it's not going to damage anything
Rodrigo says first live stream end it's
my birthday I you know who else's
birthday it is the original NCIX
cameraman so to be clear guys b-roll
slick diesel and cameraman are all
different people ok so the cameraman is
actually a specific person not
necessarily whoever's operating the
camera so it's his birthday tomorrow so
there you go happy birthday original
NCIX cameraman I get a shout-out on my
birthday on Sunday dude how am I gonna
remember that by sunday but shout out
now sure now yeah yay natural data's
madam hi from Paris hello ah I know it's
free and all but a simple sorry we're
late is in order um I did send out a
sorry we're late I guess you're not
following on Twitter you'd messaged you
probably just didn't see it so Twitter
is here twitter is free to free
notifications for our free lateness yes
we are late for free and we can tell you
that we're late for free as well and
what we'll do to make it up to you guys
is a nice free apology we're sorry for
being late today followed up by free
videos followed up by more free videos
you know what let's do our first lives
new topic um you know what let's start
with speaking of free things there's the
free linus tech tip
forum guys join it's free and speaking
of free things on the linus tech tips
for him free far cry 3 blood dragon okay
so there's a few things like oh I didn't
get it I didn't get three freaking
everything else because here's another
random freaky thank you got it it goes
on for pages here's some more random
stuff here's some random free stuff you
know what guys I've said it before and
I'll say it again this is the best
community on the internet we love the
community that's going on here people
are helpful and supportive and
respectful and there are exceptions and
we're dealing with them but by and large
it is the best forum community I've ever
been a part of and you guys should go be
a part of it too yeah hey I'm not going
to harp on it too much because we talk
about it a lot but speaking on things
that we harp on too much you did some
good stuff yeah EA did something good so
I'm gonna let you handle this one I
think you found this article okay so
they disabled the online pass a lot of
the only computer people around might be
like what the heck is online pass I
leave up henan sexy bicep for everyone
to enjoy while you talk leave it right
there it's so family um okay so online
pass basically you got it with the game
when you bought a console game and
enabled you to play online basically the
idea was if you resold the game in any
way people would have to rebuy the
online pass which was is like the most
horrible thing ever it's crazy and if
you think about it if someone's buying a
used game they're probably not buying it
for the multiplayer aspect or maybe they
are why no matter they are yeah i mean
like if you're gonna call a physical
copy a license then you better call it a
license it better be a license for
everything that it is yeah but if you
think about it EA closed something down
that probably means they weren't making
a ton of money outfit just to be
completely honest like I know this is
something good that they did but just to
be completely honest they probably
weren't making that much money on it so
my idea is that when people are buying
used games it's months and months down
the line so they're assuming that the
online community isn't gonna be as big
anymore online communities for some
smaller games okay um and why did they
sell the game in the first place if it
was a heavily multiplayer based title
unless things were on the decline yep I
see so you had some examples where
you've encountered this in the past did
you
not me ya know my console I thought you
said your dad had to do something or
something or meeting it b-roll was that
you I never- I definitely have not okay
well at any rate so so what would happen
is you'd sell the game and be like hey
now you have to buy this thing to be
okay online so it was just kind of
trashy no one liked it looking like most
things with you um so yeah they dished
it probably because they weren't making
money definitely because stated by them
because no one liked it yeah so the
article the article does go on to sort
of take a couple shots at EA which we've
never really been known to do in the
past but basically blah blah blah I've
been a long-standing initially launched
oh yeah this is on destructoid.com to
see you know guys if you want to go
check out the whole article uh uh uh huh
IEA remains committed to its other
content plans including buckets of
downloadable extras and the packaging of
games as services so let's talk about
downloadable extras our
microtransactions going anywhere no or
are they ever gonna go away they're not
going away they're definitely going
somewhere why aren't they going away
because if people hate it so much how is
it that game developers don't have to
just stop doing it because people hate
it so much and continue to use it right
one thing is it makes unlimited we're
looking at you it makes an almost
unlimited ceiling frame which you can
pay for the game yep and so it makes an
almost unlimited ceiling for how much
they can make on the game yeah without
being um subscription-based yep so you
can pay at your own pace so you know
someone gets your birthday and you can
treat yourself to some armor or just
visual yeah so it could be just cosmetic
on right so it could be a skin or
whatever you call it in whatever game
one thing that I think is crazy is when
things are subscription-based and they
have microtransactions because then
everyone that you have has a credit card
it's kind of an interesting idea because
then you're not catering to all the
people that will never pay anything for
the game you're only catering people
that are already invested in the game
and already have the means to invest
more
because they have a credit card hmm so I
think that'll be interesting if anyone
can pull it off I know Eve does it to a
certain degree but it's not as heavy as
other games do yeah so there you go guys
if you're not part of the solution
you're part of the problem if you don't
like microtransactions and you don't
like same day downloaded aab
downloadable content and all that kind
stop stop buying it it's like what else
what else can you really compare it to I
don't know it's like it's like
complaining about EA releasing a new NHL
game every year and like do you own one
there you go I haven't bought a sports
game since 1994 oh crap no I bought one
I bought two thousand four NHL okay so i
bought two two sports games in 20 years
I you should know an EA employee so I
would get them for 10 but so I'm part of
the problem so I don't think I you're
part of the problem too you gave EA ten
dollars that's true so the last time I
did that was 2005 okay let's play him
alive back to twitter before that was
blitz for what was that n64 seriously
gonna fill blitz blitz was amazing i'm
so much fun there was no like actual
tactics just like grabbed the guy
closest to the guy with the ball and
just spam hit and just a lot of people
are gonna get injured it's gonna be
awesome alrighty there Jenny from the
block figures your regulation hottie I
don't even necessarily know what that
first time live hello ah 955 is gonna
bottleneck that card yes I'm hearing and
all I hear is EA give us a chance we
won't do anything to mess with you well
yes you sell X number of copies you need
servers to run ex-member of games sold
game trades hands same amount of server
space used oh oh ok ok eduardo saying
that like yeah okay 140 characters yeah
yeah i think it's it's a it's a twitter
issue here so so basically that there's
no justification for EA charging more
because the actual blows on
okay isn't increasing watching on a
hundred and twenty inch I'm almost
afraid to click on this but I'm gonna do
it I'm gonna do it yeah very nice that's
B's very nice 120 inch TV that's like
actually ah wow that's huge I think
that's almost four times the size of my
know it must be a projector appreciates
projector must be a project producer
yeah okay which isn't to say that there
aren't 120 inch tvs it's just that most
people don't have them and it doesn't
look like one it doesn't look like a TV
that is another thing that is a factor
all right so I don't know how to go go
back in here but at any rate we're back
ah once I twitch chat is the screen keep
on going black for you kind of every
once in a while that's happening on my
screen as I'm monitoring twitch I'm just
trying to figure if that's actually
happening to everyone else nope
apparently nope better not so good
problem is you why do you always monitor
the stream you want to see if it's
library yeah but you know it's gonna
affect our bandwidth right which
increases the chance of it going down
see the one time I was on a different
network that was the first time I did it
okay i forgot to switch system hey rate
high bro which case 200 our cooler
master half they're very different for
an matx board will neither um get the
new get the new 350d from coarser is
there any way to implement a classified
section in the forum for used hardware
we're looking into it in the future
honestly and I hope you guys don't take
this the wrong way but well the way that
it we'd like to implement it is so that
there's some kind of contribution back
to the forum with it so maybe there it
costs a dollar to list things we're
hoping that this will do two things one
is it'll help support the forum and two
is that it will prevent spanning because
the one thing actually this is a extreme
systems org charges to sign up for their
forum at all now and what they've
discovered is that spammers are not
willing to spend money they won't risk
any money 22 span and to scam people and
we don't want to charge people join the
forum but we are worried about people
abusing the crap out of class what
happened
it happened so much and it increases the
load on the moderation team in a huge
way because there's always some dispute
or something and honestly the moderation
team is probably too small right now to
begin with they're amazing but they're
also too small and for people wondering
about becoming a moderator we are moving
the way I do it is I make sure everyone
is trained up before I recruit anyone
new so we're currently in a training
process okay so let's move on to our
next topic here which is that i'll let
you cover this one as well so this is
from the BBC so this is good or bad wow
this is terrible this is pretty much how
can this be good who is this good for if
you hate Nintendo but I don't know
anyone who hates Nintendo pavement I
literally don't know anyone who hates
Nintendo it's impossible Aiden to know
anyways there's probably someone over
here that does that likes this but EA
was just like oh yeah you're not
entirely successful dropped wow so we
had one good news item for this one good
news head yeah so the wii has sold only
3.4 million units from an anticipated 4
million unit so far which means it's i
not hitting its sales target but it
looks like what about fifteen twenty
percent something along those lines so
that's bad and then on top of that in
spite of the fact that EA had launch
titles ready to go for Wii U including
mass effect 3 fifa 13 and need for speed
most wanted they have completely
decommitted doing any day of said we
have no developers working on wii u
titles we're not precluding ever making
another wii u title but not fully not
going to be these ones and they're
pretty major than and so it was a
battlefield for madden and fifa are not
coming to the Wii U and I think we've
already made one fifa game so i guess
they're not just okay tinuing with that
not continuing with fifa um which is
just wow i mean at what point does
nintendo just go the sega root become a
game dev
licensing Mario maybe Mario yeah because
Mario is still in the top I think it's
top five for best-selling games like
currently best-selling games sewn in 10
and Nintendo does amazingly well on
handhelds that's another thing people
are ignoring there was a there's a chart
recent really recently released there we
go but I think it was a Ubisoft going
like top 20 selling games right now or
if I think it was last quarter or
something and Nintendo was in there for
Mario but nothing else but then it was
also stated that if they included
portables Nintendo would have been in
there multiple times right so Nintendo
is still doing you ok it's just not
their console but here okay you know
what I'm going to I'm gonna sort of go
on a tangent here sort of actually no
I'm just going to lead into one of our
other topics which is that project
shield in videos handheld android based
gaming console has a 720p screen
supports some really cool features
including streaming from a g-force
equipped desktop located within the
vicinity so it uses Wi-Fi to actually
stream the gameplay from a computer
that's being used to power it so you
could run games on an android handheld
like Hawkin that don't stand a chance of
running on a tiger three or a Tegra 4 or
a Tegra five or whatever kind of Tegra
because it's actually powered by a gtx
titan somewhere else in the house and
all you're doing is beaming the actual
images to to and from the the handheld
device so with stuff like that coming
down the pipe so Oh what was the what
was the pre-order was it 449 crowd oh I
can't remember I can't remember how much
it was any more twitch chat help me out
here how much does how much does project
shield cost so pre-orders are up for
people who have been following project
shield what does this mean for handheld
if you could have with how many games
are available on Android with how much
development is going to continue to be
thrown at it even with like just
completely devastating projects like a
crap what was that stupid console called
oh yeah yeah like the Ouya we even were
even though that was just an utter
disaster
it's not like it's slowing down everyone
wants Android to be a viable gaming
platform looks about 350 350 sorry yeah
so that's a fantastic deal it's not that
much more expensive than something like
a Nintendo and 3ds bombed because 3d was
not the right technology for them to go
for um but doesn't make a difference
because they're still doing great and
one thing with project shield too is if
you're gonna carry project shield around
I don't think that's gonna slip into
your pocket as yes that bulky it's ok
I'm troller yes not gonna slip into your
pocket it's if you're some sort of bag
any kind of bag purse bag whatever
you've got it it's not gonna slip in
your pocket ok that's true that des will
slip in your butt I did carry a d/s
later on with me for a long time until
it broke it's doable there it's a little
bulky but it's still doable project
shield is not okay fine then how about
this what about the possibility of
carrying around something like a
SteelSeries free which is that little
bluetooth controller and then a more
normal Android device like definitely
especially like big phones like like
five years from now when a phone is
delivering just an insane amount of
horsepower so here here ok couple things
couple things oh this is going to lead
into another topic that I wasn't sure if
I wanted to get into yet but ok so the
galaxy s4 beautiful device awesome
device the bomb cost so though for those
of you who aren't familiar the bill of
materials cost of the galaxy s4 is
estimated by IHS to be two hundred and
thirty-seven dollars that includes a
1080p mo LED screen that includes a
Snapdragon s600 that includes two gigs
of ram 16 gigs of storage and you know
an operating system that is very viable
as a gaming platform communications
platform honestly the sky's the limit
for what Android can do in the future ok
now think about this for a minute the
actual cost of the galaxy s4 then
obviously isn't in the materials it's in
the rd that goes into it it's into the
rd it's in the distribution it's in the
software development it's in all this
other stuff so riddle me this is that
why when you go to a
cell phone providers store the galaxy s4
is 199 with contract and the cheapest
phone may have is free because actually
it doesn't cost that much less to make a
cheap phone because you still have to
buy all that crap it's not like a 720p
screen costs that much more than a 1080p
screen like it might cost half as much
or twice as much for a 1080p one but
when we're talking $35 versus seventeen
dollars or when we're talking sixty
dollars versus thirty dollars in the
grand scheme of things it's not actually
that much so if everyone already has an
android device that's as powerful as
anything Nintendo can make and try to
sell you for 199 or 249 as a dedicated
gaming device what chance could they
possibly stand when they have to do all
the rd anyway they're not going to be
able to be competitive on price because
people can get all this subsidized stuff
anyway um they're not going to be online
because Nintendo apparently doesn't
understand online gameplay at all no it
does don't make at all I mean is
handheld even gonna be a business for
them in five years it's a very good
point because when you spend a whole
bunch of money on the phone that you're
gonna buy anyways and then you're in the
store and you're like oh I should check
out where these Nintendo jabbers oh wait
I can do everything in my phone already
yep why would you actually buy one and
would there be more money in it for a
Nintendo to figure out how to
microtransaction out something like
Mario Kart speaking of microtransactions
would you buy a new cart for my crib for
Mario Kart it was like really sweet if
it's cool enough honestly maybe I don't
do micro chance that much but sometimes
but once I it's cool enough if it's very
iconic if it's something super nostalgic
I'm like picking up yes like if they had
like an 8-bit cart probably see Yeah
right like or like there's a few
different things so maybe maybe Android
will be a possibility for nintendo and
maybe sure maybe they don't do their own
hardware anymore um they've always been
known like except for their super old
consoles they've always been known for
their titles anyways yeah yeah exactly I
mean n64 was not a groundbreaking
console hardware wise at all really um I
think we can all agree we was
gamecube sure wasn't were you wii u is
like it has a screen on the controller
yeah i think we're a couple generations
of battery technology away from that
actually being a thing yeah oh this is
not a topic and alleging so i'll save it
for next week nevermind continue um so
anyway i think the future is android
devices I don't know that project shield
is necessarily the answer but remember
we talked last week about the galaxy s4
zoom which is Samsung's camera with a
phone built into it yeah rather than a
phone with a camera built into it what
about the potential for a shield too
that's a phone yep and why not i shield
is what if it was a stock Android
experience phone that was also a gaming
device with a built-in controller and
could stream from your geforce graphics
card would you buy it very possibly it
because slightly slimmer because okay
the couch gaming experience even though
i'm a pc gamer is still a thing yes just
when I do it's usually super classic
consoles on games that I found it crazy
retro stores um but like I understand oh
there's a ton of people out there that
have ds's this is another thing that I
surprised you didn't throw back at me is
a ton of people have ds's and they never
leave the house the reason why they have
the PS is so that they can kind of move
around within their house they can play
it in the kitchen they can play it in
the bat in the bath they can play well
they're hanging on the couch that is
actually a huge use case for portable
devices it's not actually leaving the
house so my tablet never leaves the
house yeah so shield will totally
dominate that section I think so too
actually it's gonna be awesome I mean
streaming video to it you know when
you're maybe you're not playing games
maybe you're on the can you just want to
watch a video YouTube whatever holy crap
shields gonna be awesome it's gonna
destroy and the ergonomics of it is
actually more comfortable than even for
watching video I would make an argument
that you should watch on a project
shield not on your phone of course and
phones are weird phones are not
comfortable no not for not for like
holding like this for an extended period
of time because also usually the screen
comes really close to the edge yeah I
don't know if it's probably still prone
for you but thumbs not not as much of a
problem for me miss Maier small but
still often cover up a little bit of the
screen have you seen the galaxy s4 it's
the same form factor as the s3 right
and it goes almost to the bezel because
there's almost no bezel on it cuz it's a
5-inch screen versus a 4.7 inch screen
which is great which is exactly like
what you're talking but then if you're
watching a movie holding it like this
you're covering up part of the screen
and like the speaker's always talk
unless they're like yours but even then
if you're holding it like this you're
coming up the speakers I've had a lot of
people tell me they think project
shields ridiculous and a lot of the
comments on my project shield coverage
from CES would indicate that they felt
like it was ridiculous I totally
disagree I disagree one hundred percent
and I have since day one I believe
disagrees well and I think once it's
released it'll be fine I think part of
the reason is I usually bat for this
team as well but it's a whole bunch of
pc gamers that have no interest in going
and sitting on the couch mm-hmm but if i
can play casual pc titles yeah so not
stuff that i'm going to be playing most
of time when i'm sitting at my computer
racing game but if i get erase it
exactly if i get a racing game or
something like that that i would
honestly plug a controller into my
computer for anyways racing games
sometime action ventures stuff like that
i could just go lay on the couch and
play it on my board and it unifies the
experience because all of a sudden
instead of buying a game for my xbox if
i want to play it on the big screen or
friggin like hauling my computer down
next to the TV come on guys put up your
hand have you done it I've done it see
right which is like which is ridiculous
I did it for like two weeks one's
unifying the platform so you only have
to buy the game once to have a PC
experience a handheld experience and a
big-screen experience yeah well that's
why I was so excited with steam box
which is a big deal so so yeah that's
that's very exciting and apparently I
have an e-mailed it's actually really
important so go ahead talk about
whatever you want uh we just finished
the topic anyways I'm gonna jump into
the topic that I was going to say for
next week which is phone technology I
personally don't think is like
acceptable at all right now really I
kind of think all phones suck this one
yep what sucks about it battery okay um
okay so yes battery technology is so far
off what's going on you know what my
first cell phone had about a
three day battery my second cell phone
was a nokia that lasted for like four or
five days yeah um and that was with
gaming on it I played snake nice snake
was awesome yes but like what the heck
years ago and now constantly people
coming out going oh there's there's new
battery technology it's gonna make your
phone last for a month uh uh I mean you
hear nothing nothing yeah what are you
talking about putting like fuel cells
and phone at one point they were doing
tons of stuff and none of it ever
happens I don't want my phone to last
for a day anymore right why do we accept
it cuz you know what it's funny because
I that was one of the reasons I held off
on getting a smartphone was because even
my blackberry sort of smartphone but
like it was an older when it was like an
8000 series or something like that so it
had like a color screen which was moving
okay it's not like the scroll wheel
wasn't touchscreen nothing like that so
even that one lasted for two days two
and a half maybe three days um and one
of the reasons I held off for a long
time I didn't get a smartphone like a
touchscreen smartphone until iphone 4
and so I held off cuz I was like well I
don't know charge my phone every day
yeah but for some reason now I'm used to
it now I accept it and I expect the
actual technological improvements will
not be made on batteries but will be
made on things like wireless charging so
we'll get to the point where instead of
carrying around battery banks with you
your phone has a wireless charger built
into the dash all right I your phone
your car your car has a wireless charger
built into the dash your your room your
bedroom has a wireless charger that
sound was the whole ring somehow yeah
and then your backpack you can carry a
battery bank that is a wireless charger
just make sure your phone somewhere near
it and you'll be constantly charging up
your device I'll have to figure out a
way to make them care in some way that's
secure so people can't SAP your power
whatever else but I think that's
actually where we're headed in order to
extend battery life stew because if you
could be charging your phone somewhat or
like if you dropped your backpack next
to a wall wart when you walk in and it
charged that and then you kept your
phone in your pocket close enough to
your backpack if you're at school and it
charged your phone you might actually
still be able to go days without charge
your phone this could be an opportunity
for a wireless charging battery maker to
develop a backpack and then sell the
whole solution the whole solution could
be a viable commercial product okay so
if anyone's out there watching this idea
um we want a ten percent royalty yep
just like everything else pretty don't
go just like everything else we bring up
on the screen because honestly I think
it's a great idea I think turning
wireless charging into something that's
all around you as opposed to something
that's like Samson I think they won't
like what they want likes ND bucks for
it or something like that or 60 bucks
for like blue oh the plate thing you put
the thing on you out for the play time
just like will know where it's not there
yet and I know that there's a reason
that it costs money cuz it's still
expensive but if we can get to the point
where that technology improves enough
that your phone actually just lasts for
days without you ever even thinking
about it that's probably the solution
but like okay I jumped on the smartphone
game late as well as you I jumped in
with a nexus s before then I would have
slider phones always like slider phones
phones are stupid but it would last for
like a week yeah but it's a slider i
mean they've so flimsy alban not the one
I had which one did you have i dont
rember the name of it but it was like
seriously bulky I would throw it
constantly it came into a lake with me
like the thing was a beast um I don't
know if it was that one that was just
specifically durable or what but I have
one slider phone I guess I shouldn't say
I always I always had slider phones yeah
I wish has Eckstein slider phones well
broke i had one phone before his mart
phone i was never really that into
phones so i had my slider phone I had
more funds cuz I'm just older than you
yes um but that thing would last for
like a week I would barely ever charge
it everyone smile be like beep beep me
oh I also leave it on overnight and
it'll be good for a week again speaking
of battery life you know what ticks me
off about Android you know how um like
your phone will buzz when something
comes in the screen doesn't turn on yeah
it drives me crazy so like my photo
Basel be like because I'm used to iphone
with an iphone it your notifications are
all there whenever a new notification
comes in that drives me absolutely not
no it's bad for battery life I like that
because I set up the LED indicator on my
s3 to tell me what notification I got
you can change notification colors in
your different apps yeah so I have
different colors for every type of
notification that I've gotten so I
always know I don't have to have the
screen tell me just a little LED thing
tells me well I don't know I liked it
because I get a lot of tweets and stuff
so when something comes in i like being
able to glance at it see if it's
important and then put it down although
yeah my screen would be on pretty much
constant and there's probably some app
so speaking of battery technology wow
we're like we're on a segway rule today
because hahaha yes very good ah just
look lap that's just a one person I've
actually made that joke on the live
stream before but you were probably
sleeping ah so this topic right here
where did this go ah yes so this was a
community contributed news item and it
is dented inattentive the Chevy Volt
turned into a whole house ups so rather
than recycle old hybrid electric and EV
batteries which can be quite costly GM
and ABB have modeled a prototype for a
house / small building ups this allows
batteries that have not quite okay so I
it's from extreme tech and the forum
member who contributed this is old 720
so this um allows them to create a brown
loops around a twenty five kilowatt hour
ups which is capable of running an
average American home for almost a day
in addition to that it has the added
benefit of meaning you know less waste
and less cost and recycling it has the
other benefit of acting as a prep blah
blah blah blah is smoother power surge
protection and protection from outages
which is really cool I think this is a
smartest thing ever they ship them on a
pallet so they could actually lift them
in for disasters oh that's really cool
right that's very very cool I was like
this is like the smartest thing ever
because if you're gonna develop this
battery technology that final
someone's developing some battery
technology for something and if we're
not seeing it for our smartphones so car
battery technology this is like the
smartest way of using something that was
at the end of its useful life cycle that
I've seen in a long time yeah Tesla's
been making some pretty awesome waves so
I it would allow you to okay so you
could use it you could use it to power
lights and rescue equipment and
disasters you could use it in place of a
generator for things like events I mean
imagine this instead of hauling around
like a diesel generator for something
like a parade or something like a video
shoot if you could rent one of these
where they just drop it off on a flatbed
and it's like out of day worth power
you've gotten well remember runs an
average American house for a day right
so if you're running late cameras and
like you have a whole bunch of lights
yeah okay right lights okay fair fair
enough so you drop off a couple of them
or or a bank of them for a shoot what
goodness that's cool right and then
wouldn't they wouldn't make any noise
unlike Jen what generators can do
although there are quiet ones that are
designed purpose-built for that but I
don't know I just I think it's really
really cool do you know cuz I know um
Tesla is doing the easily removable
batteries now in the car do you know if
they're gonna be doing something like
this no idea no idea no idea although I
did see my first car charging station in
Vancouver last weekend it was at
Guildford mall they had two specific
spots for for electronic vehicles that's
cool they're color-coded green they had
little charging stations they ask you to
limit your state of two hours um I I
thought I was someone tweeted me I
thought this would be pretty fun you
should you should see if you can find
someone with a hammer and get them to
park there just like take a picture see
what happens be awesome I have a buddy
that has a volt it's actually pretty
cool car yeah have you tried driving it
I have not driven it personally but I've
been in the car quite a bit okay its
period has a pet a pedestrian horn have
you heard of that uh yeah yeah it's not
super loud so if someone's like right in
front of you and they can't hear you can
be like hey you're the way cuz the car
doesn't make really any noise right so
you have to have some way of wanting
people that isn't like the normal
insanely loud horn I've always thought
that like car horns should have more
options like if there was a coat
like you know how road rage particularly
in the old days um and I mean like 10
years ago cuz I'm not that old when I
first started driving you know what
every speed trap on the road we didn't
have to rely on ways or google maps
because people were courteous when there
was a speed trap the people coming the
other way would flash their beams at you
come on where did that go why don't we
do that anymore it's helpful cheese so
what now I have to have an app on my
phone so I'm like this to find out if
I'm gonna get oh I'm gonna get a ticket
for doing this now never mind that and
yet it doesn't speed at all what what um
so I mean come on guys this is
ridiculous you know what's funny i
actually only drive like twice a week
now you drive times a week on the
weekends yeah I'll Drive I usually drive
when my wife and I go somewhere anyway
um yeah so like yeah so what happened to
common courtesy and I always thought
cars needed more ways to communicate
with other drivers because the problem
with a horn is it's angry sounding yep
what about a polite hunk like why don't
you have a different option why is it
there like a baby we should you should
have flashable red lights on the
frontier car because red light won't
make your eyes freak out yeah like
communication devices on cards and I
always wanted I like it's one of those
things where if I'd had like money to
just blow on absolutely nothing I might
have done it at some point but I always
wanted like an LED array in the back
window so I could put up little messages
oh my thanks for not tailgating you know
with that even cadential and I think so
it should be okay though if I be
hilarious would love that by the way it
must exist turtle on a sec tips are home
look put it on the back yard oh yeah-
thanks for not delegating by the way we
cool you could actively hook it up to a
laptop if you hate my driving go
complain about it on- technakhan it
helps my website traffic yeah yeah
awesome someone says things like that
exists oh I'm sure they do yeah I'm sure
they do I just never I've never actually
seen one and I've certainly never bought
one so let's do a little bit of Twitter
Q&amp;amp;A guys I know we've kind of ignored
y'all
my bolt news apparently dates back from
November whatever I hadn't heard of it
so they're different countries have
different horns even on the same cars
that i actually have encountered I had
no idea but what I want is one car with
multiple horns yeah uh what's up with
the Twinkie box on your wall I was sent
by a live stream viewer who I slick and
I both said we'd never tried a Twinkie
so a viewer sent us a box most of the
Twinkies are still in there so we're
gonna try them again in a year to see if
there isn't good it was not aware of
this my dad wants me to build him an
extreme gaming business pc with the
two-and-a-half k budget he wants a 39 70
x just get a king tell me to invest in
tasker yes if i have any money what oh
yeah it's a cool app is it what's it do
I don't actually remember I think it's
like a task manager for your phone I had
it on my Nexus S but it's been so long
hmm maybe it's a setting cuz tom says
his s3 turns on the screen vibrate time
does the notification LED Windows Phone
terms the screen on when you get a
notification as well yes that's true
that's one of the things that I didn't
appreciate about Windows Phone because I
didn't notice it cuz I assumed they all
did that on cuz I'd again I'd come from
iphone yay Carl LG cosmos very nice see
they're kind of pisa for some reason
their batteries always lasted forever I
did Nintendo cleaning place ads and ah
we're gonna talk about that in the after
party John we are aware of this so
Nintendo has been claiming monetization
from Game streamers who are streaming
Nintendo games so we're gonna talk about
it later made it ah screaming I'm not
gonna say that oh wait what what no a
different thing to feel good so what
you're saying is we have the technology
yes Mario is the live stream again we're
going till we're done I know some people
have asked us to change the game whereas
others have said they love the game so
we're gonna do whatever we want which is
what I want and we're gonna play that
game we're gonna play some bio I love
Mario when I'm apparently terrible
because I'm Jennifer honestly I'm up to
the part where I'm having a little bit
of trouble with it too I think I took
like four cracks of that fortress I've
done better
what you're doing a lot better i'm not
doing quite as well but oh oh yeah our
USB to SNES adapter hasn't arrived from
amazon yet but i have some really cool
stuff that did arrive for us from B&amp;amp;H
photo-video know do what no no I don't
want us but room I'm just gonna show
them no no no we're not getting no no
b-roll wants to be there when they open
them so what does huh I thought he was
here why don't you cover this what you
go carry on okay what is this or showed
you build boats ah yeah yeah that's for
what is this okay so galaxy s4 supposed
to hit 10 million sales in about a week
which means a little bit under a month
since release that compares to s3
selling them about 10 million in about
50 days that's insane I and for context
guys s3 still is the number one selling
smartphone ever so so as for it looks
like it's gonna be even better yeah
which which is kind of nuts to me
because yes Samsung is doing a massive
massive marketing push again huge I read
something like 410 million dollars in US
which is nuts um but I haven't heard as
much about it as the s3 the s3 was such
a big big debate the iphone vs s3 debate
was huge and there's so much going
around about it asks for yeah there's a
lot going around about it but most of it
seems very very very samsung funded
instead of organic so i did not think
that the sales were going to be quite as
high but apparently they are which is
just absolutely insane this was from
cnet news at seen it to the if you just
look out cnet samsung galaxy s4 sales to
hit 10 million next week I haven't seen
sale numbers for iphone 5 so I can't
compare it directly to iphone 5s
original month if someone knows in
twitch chat if you could fire that in
twitch chat we can compare because s4
seems like it's just going to smash also
people that bought an s4 I don't know if
this is here give me one second guys
I actually don't see it but there's
going to be an s4 that is going to be
updated by Google instead of Samsung
that is on the Play Store which is
really interesting i think it's 600 649
dollars for an s4 on the Play Store
where you get your updates from google
and i believe it's unlocked so that's
interesting that's actually quite
intriguing because that's not that much
money realistically a lot of times are
around 900 for a new fancy phone and
updated by Google is a huge thing
because that brings back my love for
Nexus because Nexus I've my Nexus S and
nothing would always get new updates the
second google is done with them so that
was awesome oh my goodness all the
things yeah you can go this way oh I
thought you could go that way I'll bet
hurt okay so I don't see any of this
stuff yeah we got some pretty cool stuff
in the mail from B&amp;amp;H so we were
upgrading our gear once again if you
guys have seen some of the latest videos
we've done so if you're not already
subscribed to tech quickie go subscribe
now because we have a hilarious video on
there at least I think it's funny um
about how to upgrade your Mac with a
samsung SSD yeah is it funny this gets
funny I think it's funny um anyway so we
want to continue to improve our
production values so we've got a few
different things here that are gonna
help us and guys when I say improve our
production values I mean when it's not
slicker me operating the camera yeah cuz
we know we suck it's fine we get it um
so check this out we got a psychotic
light Master Pro which is a light meter
apparently b-roll and diesel insisted I
had to buy one of these it's like 500
bucks so what this allows you to do is
do more than just eyeball the lighting
when you're when you're setting up a
shot but this allows you to actually
empirically measure the light in
different places so you can make things
look more better supposedly if they
don't end up using this like I'll fire
them both because yeah they were we have
that thing now so incessant to do so
insistent we also got this which is
extremely exciting this is the small
hdac 7 so right now our camera
this little eeny weeny little display on
it that it's just not acceptable how
hard to use and it's ergonomic is an
ergonomic nightmare oh yeah because the
camera is heavy particularly with the
lens on it and then like the screens
like up here at the back and it can turn
to the side and that's it it's not on an
articulating arm or anything like that
so unless you're holding the camera like
in front of you like this somehow
because you're made of magic or you have
like a Steadicam vest or something like
that it is completely horrible you can't
shoulder mount it because you can't see
it it's behind you so the small HD is
dented i denti I'm just gonna I'm just
gonna look at it watch it hit that bonus
like oh no no it's all good so the small
HD is a 7 inch screen there's an LED
version but we didn't get that one that
actually has some diagnostic stuff built
in and is going to allow us to mount it
to an arm so you can see it has
universal mounting here so that you can
shoulder mount the camera and have the
screen stick out in front of you so you
can actually see what you're doing the
other thing about the screen now is it
so small it's really hard for us to
figure out if things are in focus or not
while we're filming it's almost
impossible so this uses component hdmi
inputs as well as I think there's one
more yeah it has oh oh it looks like we
didn't get the SDI version oh yeah I
think that wouldn't cost extra our
camera supports SD I but late yeah
whatever the other one was more
expensive and there's no real difference
in image quality as far as we could tell
so there you go we got a small HD which
we are extremely excited about there's
probably a bunch of exposure is's and
all kinds of cool stuff my phone's
ringing right now it's probably be roll
raging at me for opening it without him
alright so what else we got just keep on
tripping up shoulder rig oh I'm so
excited for this so we got an fs700
shooter which has a counterweight so
that when you mount the camera on your
shoulder it's it's evenly rather than
just like hanging all the weight on your
arms which is what we did at CES so we
got this for computex this was a grand
yeah camera equipment is ridiculous it's
criminal how much this stuff costs if
you can see and see things and you want
to make all the money ever yes make very
basic camera equipment yeah very new
camera equipment be like the one guy who
makes the weird adapter for like the one
camera and get all the money and
like all these companies can afford to
go to like these massive trade shows and
show off their like stupid adapter that
you're just like k yeah I guess I mean
look at this look at this I mean this is
the level of sort of like professional
and this is a pretty well regarded
brands this is a goood oh it comes with
like paper inside like that's how it's
packed it's in bubble wrap like it's
like dudes and their garages it's like
water cooling basically whoa there's the
counterweights those are heavy um like
they're just wait I know here's an
internal memory so upset cuz we're
totally taking okay we are taking this
one out but I wasn't planning to do an
unboxing video this one anyway so so
anyway so there's that and then last but
not least for improving our audio
quality yet again not not levels just
quality this is a blimp and I had no
idea they were this big so this covers
your microphone and avoids any um wind
noise avoids any vibration noise and
handling noise and all that kind of cool
stuff so your your microphones like
suspended on a bunch of stuff and it's
cool and yeah anyway so there that's all
of our new gear that we're extremely
excited about and will allow us to make
even more better videos than we ever
have before in fact our best video ever
is not the Samsung upgrade your Mac
video that's the best one we've released
we have another one that's pending
release it's done we're waiting for the
manufacturer to give us the green light
to to unleash it on the world and we are
really really excited oh I've been
waiting for so long to that video to be
able to go live it's gonna be really
good yeah yeah I'm both slick and I are
in it but we also have actors so this is
this was our biggest production
and oh come on Oh his problem okay I
need my power adapter do you know where
it is I think so okay did you cover
anymore did you cover windows 8.1 no
okay I'll talk about that so guys we
finally have confirmation from
Microsoft's there's been a lot of talk
about windows blue or Windows 8.1 or
whatever it's going to end up being is
it going to be a new OS is it going to
be an iteration is it going to be free
is it going to be a service pack is it
going to be maybe like a twenty dollar
upgrade or thirty dollar upgrade sort of
like what Apple does with the last n
where they've been calling it OS 10 for
an awful long time to the point where
I'm not even convinced it's the same
operating system anymore quite just you
know adding features and doing this in
doing that and releasing them as
incremental smaller upgrades in much the
same way that Microsoft has
traditionally done by charging more
upfront and doing service packs over
time so it looks like Windows 8.1 will
be more like a service pack than
anything else they are implementing some
new functionality they are not charging
for it as a standalone product so it's
just going to be adding a start menu
they are making some changes to the UI
to make the modern UI more friendly for
mouse users the source for this was da
da da da which one is this the source
for this one was daily tech so here you
go guys check out the full article on
daily tech they are keeping the arm
variant and it looks like guys like
nvidia are still very committed to it
and it might be helped in some ways by
some of the things that they're doing to
unify the experience between Windows 8
and the windows RT version and honestly
I think probably the most important
thing they're doing from a tablet
perspective with Windows 8.1 is they are
adjusting the modern UI so it'll work on
7 and 8 inch tablets because right now
the tablets that are cleaning up our
devices like the Nexus 7 I mean you can
get a nexus 7 refurb at NCIX us for 150
bucks yeah would you spend three hundred
dollars plus on the Windows RT tablet at
the point yes it comes with office but
given that the Nexus 7 is already going
to do most of what you needed to do and
it's more portable anyway ND gigi's
google
10 inch tablet has always felt like a
very awkward form factor for me I do use
my iPad a lot I don't own a 7-inch
tablet and I'm not convinced that I
would still use my iPad 2 if I had an
ipad mini um what do you think yeah
probably I've I personally have never
liked the tablet form factor at any
point I don't like Minnie's I don't like
Diana like sevens I don't like tens I
don't like tablets what if you could
have an 18 and a half inch tablet asus
has one no I don't get it I'm not into
it at all I do not like it I kind of
maybe I do not like green eggs and ham I
do not like them sam-i-am I do not like
mine in a house like if you had if you
had like a communal home tablet may be
okay just so like it can kind of sit on
the coffee table by the couch and people
can just like check things really quick
I do not want an apple one I do not
think that they are fun yes I was trying
to think of some way to incorporate
apples good job good job thank you uh so
anyway um moving right along so Windows
8.1 will be free that will be good it
will tweak some things uh yes so the
start menu i mentioned before the start
menu is gonna be added do you remember
about the start menu does now it just
goes to a modern UI so it does nothing
but you kind of already did no one
already did okay you know what it'll fix
for me though because one of the things
that actually drives me crazy is the way
that I navigate to device manager just
by habit is I right click start menu
properties not having a start menu is
like oh my goodness how do i get to the
device manager I don't know how to do it
anymore will that work what it doesn't
come up well I don't know I don't know
if they okay if anyone from Microsoft is
watching Tim if you're watching is the
right click context menus day yeah is
the right click context menu still in
the start menu because if it's not
that's gonna be a big problem for me
anyway well you'll probably still be
installing a third party app anyways
we've got something on Twitch saying
anyone who doesn't like Windows 8 didn't
give the full retail version a chance I
definitely gave it a pretty big
it's okay yeah yeah the it's beating
games is nice yeah network transfer look
nice task manager nice permissions not
nice any integration with modern UI
whatsoever at all in any amount not nice
I don't know yeah Oh modern UI is
apparently becoming more mouse friendly
i think i already said yeah earlier but
I didn't have too much of a problem with
the most in it yeah that's not the issue
for me I mean the issue for me is
density I've always wanted my computer
to have more data density not less
because I see well and bigger mouse
movements to me are not more efficient
so that was why I wanted a 30 inch 2560
by 1600 monitors it's because I wanted
all of my icons and all of my texts
smaller now modern UI takes that and
makes it so that instead of having a
start menu that's got all these little
like densely packed things like I use
detail of you when I am browsing files
because I want I want all those file
names as long as possible as much as I
can read and I want to know how big they
are and I want to know when they were
last modified and these are all things
that I actually care about when I'm
using my computer and modern UI doesnt
help me with any of that it doesn't give
me enough information and reducing the
density is never going to work for me no
matter what unless I'm on a tablet in
which case yay my biggest problem with
modern UI is okay windows 7 I have a
whole bunch of things open I'm
monitoring a few things I'm possibly
watching a video I've got chats open I'm
doing all this stuff I press Start I'm
window seven and a little menu comes up
yeah I can do my stuff really quickly
while doing everything else I press
start on Windows 8 boom everything's
good I everything my whole current
experience is completely interrupted and
stopped put to a complete halt so that i
can take too long to find whatever i'm
finding because of huge blocky icons or
the search being filtered in at three
different types of results then I get to
finally go back into the experience I
was having with that said if i was using
touch on the computer like I am with
this notebook then that's fine I'm I'd
you know I like Windows 8
mytouch notebook on my aspire s7 but
that's a touch experience and I don't
know could I be convinced at some point
you know what I could be convinced at
some point to have a touch-enabled
desktop but not necessarily because i
would use touch all the time on it but
because kids growing up my my son is
going to hardly know like is it going to
hardly know what a screen that doesn't
have a touch interface on it was like he
will expect to be touching things in
order to so for people who use that more
naturally yeah I think I think it'll
come eventually and I think windows 8
does make sense for that at some point
in the future no I actually should have
done this earlier and guys bear with me
here but I gotta run an ad so I'm gonna
explain what the idea is really quickly
first because it might not be completely
explanatory the ad itself that is so in
the u.s. if n Canada if you buy an Intel
processor a qualifying one from a
qualifying retailer and the list will be
in the description under the live
archived video it's also in some of my
other videos but most of the major guys
on online then you get a free
subscription to I racing com which is a
hyper realistic racing sim and now i'm
just going to transition into the ad
because i basically just said everything
but i have to play this anyway for a
limited time only by an intel core i5 or
core i7 cpu and get a free 3 month
subscription to I racing com available
from participating retailers click the
link in the video description for more
details some girls like yeah it worked
yeah yeah the second time right um
someone says unsubscribed whatever man
and there's nothing you can do about
adblock if we like embed an ad so there
you go good luck with that and for those
of you who use adblock on our content
come on man how are we supposed to eat
exactly assoc a problem we cater to the
techie people who know how to run a
block so equivalent channels can eat and
we can it's like oh it's actually kind
of depressing that like makeup channels
that have like a quarter as many of uses
us apparently they're doing it as a
full-time job on like really cuz
none of those people have adblock all of
our fans like yeah screw you guys I blog
yeah I don't have to watch ads it's like
good for you but come on really with
that said I don't sit and watch YouTube
ads no but delight don't sit and watch
you I don't have adblock yeah i mean
i'll skip the most of the time but you
know what i think it still counts as
send me us any impression or something
like I think they still I think ah cuz I
ok the ones that pop up for me you know
i don't remember the rules anymore but
moving right along adblock sucks uh yeah
facebook this is interesting yeah so
this is honestly it's not the deepest
analysis of you know Facebook's IPO and
the whole public offering and all the
stuff that's been going on over the last
year but what it is is it's just kind of
a neat very high level view of sort of
what's happened over the last little
while here and the page is loading the
right click on this and click view image
it'll show properly ok huge ok so check
this out guys um so here's after a
jittery half hour delay caused oh so
this source is qz prod files no that's
wrong wait where is this from yeah qz
calm there we go so after a jittery half
hour delay caused by tex mal stock
begins trading closing up 0.6% on huge
volume okay shares fell nearly twenty
percent in the next two days as people
realize like what's happened here stock
tanks another twenty percent before and
after facebook's week first earnings
report early investors and insiders can
sell right here and stock drops ten
percent from August sixteenth to august
seventeenth I really feel for anyone
actually I don't I don't really feel for
anyone who invested in facebook because
you probably should have known better I
sure did and I wasn't following it at
all okay view image next up we've got
company says Zuckerberg won't sell stock
for at least next 12 months but notes
that employees may sell from October
29th stock hits record low 1773 and it's
been better since then but it's very
rocky like this is not a roller coaster
that I would get on
second earnings release as public
company just barely beats expectations
share some nineteen percent the next day
honestly this is the crazy thing about
playing stocks to me it's like investor
confidence somehow has something to do
with the value of a company are you
crazy like okay all the respect in the
world for AMD I love those guys everyone
I know they're great guys but like the
fact that they lost less money than they
expected causes their stock to skyrocket
it's like what they're actually still
not making money like you I'm having a
goal good job but you still fail and I
mean yes I understand that it means
they're turning things around and
there's potential they could pay out
dividends at some point and all that
stuff but there's a whole lot of just
like short-term gains and short-term
losses that get made on pure speculation
there's nothing to do with anything
speaking of which we're going to talk
about Bitcoin a bit later um so moving
on to I keep I keep closing instead of
going back so we're going to move into
the next quarter which actually looks a
little bit better here we go so the
article actually has a bit of an
inflammatory title how Facebook like
basically pissed away 40 million dollars
of value in a year so okay so from that
on the graph search feature announced
market shrugs so there's a little bit of
bias in this particular article here so
take it with a grain of salt they're
kind of right though they're kind of
right but you know that they're still
kind of right yes yes they may be right
it even had like a shrug thing it's like
uh yeah there's like okay here's the
last one guys so Facebook home for
smartphones announced yeah kind of
shrugged again earnings report reassures
investors stock up five point six
percent the next day so whatever they
may be doing over there sort of whatever
business decisions that they're making
out okay what number one I don't think
Mark Zuckerberg cares anymore
at all at all if I think he's kind of
set for life um but it's just kind of
okay so two things how did they drop 40
billion in value okay there's probably
been some missteps along the way how did
anyone think it was ever worth 104
billion that's the one that really sort
of boggles my mind like all the day one
investors the amount of people that I
heard that like family friends has
taught me like oh yeah I invested in
facebook that's awesome will it go it's
not I know people who did too yeah I
know people who are still in what yeah I
knew someone who I was late after two
days after it dropped twenty percent I
was like get out no it's good it's a
long term play I'm like no it isn't so
for all the viewers there who are uh
sell it now eat beans form up you'll be
okay yeah and for those of you who think
I'm not monitoring the twitch chat and
telling slick to scare me it's not gonna
work we're hit you cuz I am monitoring a
twitch chat ruffle your hair like a dog
that was a recent one yeah I'm not gonna
know is it okay so speaking of Bitcoin
here we go this is another this is
another article on quartz this is a long
article so bitcoins black hat day black
hole black hat bitcoins days are
numbered the anonymity looks like it's
probably going to be going away the US
government seized accounts that the
japan-based mount gox the world's
largest Bitcoin exchange held at its US
bank now I'm not going to get into too
much detail about it because apparently
I board some of you with that last thing
but what it's not an attack from the US
government on Bitcoin it's an attack on
anonymous trading that's being used to
launder money and turn from Bitcoin into
other currencies ill-gotten gains and so
what's going to be happening is they are
going to be mandating that all Bitcoin
exchanges are going to be regulated by
the same laws that regular money
exchanges do so they have to be putting
in place safeguards that whatever's
going in and out is not being done in a
way that it could be laundering money
they have to be watching for people
trying to circumvent the system and this
is going to do a couple of things it's
going to I believe legitimize Bitcoin in
a big way that wasn't going to happen
without this if bitcoin was always this
like black market currency with
anonymity on its side yeah the internet
might love that but come on guys really
and and not gonna work it could have
worked to certain degree if it stayed
small if it stayed small let it show you
up and it's too it's out of one of the
hands of the people that want yes they
wanted it like anyone who wanted it to
be big what could not have possibly
expected it to stay anonymous forever
come on guys um so so I believe this is
going to legitimize it in a big way
because it's going to be regulated and
it's going to be able to be trusted in
ways that it couldn't before I mean that
Australian Bitcoin exchange relatively
small one but any Yahoo could have a
Bitcoin exchange because these laws are
going to make it so you have to put a
significant amount of overhead and
administration administration
administration behind being a Bitcoin
exchange but but before any any guy
could have a Bitcoin exchange that guy
made off like a bandit he just closed
shop and disappeared with people's
bitcoins back when they were worth like
a fortune when they went over like two
hundred dollars you something around
that time probably bail this past
weekend it's just rolling the money now
and so I I personally I've been a
skeptic about Bitcoin and one of the
things that made me extremely skeptical
about it was the anonymity it's like
it's never going to be legitimate if its
treated like something that's just this
this illegal currency so mount gox has
come out or whatever has come out saying
we are going to investigate this I tried
to go to the website and I was just
getting white page so I'm not entirely
sure what's going on that with that
right now but they might be back up but
they are going to investigate it they
are going to keep on going but then
there's the other exchange i dont rember
the namecoin something oh yeah I find
out or something like that it's in it's
in the article right yeah it's in the
article somewhere coin something who is
backed by a lot of capital yeah they're
suede lab right here are coin yeah
coinlab so they have already put
pressure on mailbox with a awesome
billion dollar loss yeah over a proposed
partnership gone sour and coil add as
well as coinbase are both register
his money transmitters already putting a
lot of pressure on Mount gox there's a
potential that they're just going to
kind of just take it peter out at this
point and they're just going to take
over because normal people especially
with some of the disasters that have
happened with bitcoin are going to want
the security of knowing that it's a real
financial institution that's handling
their money so there you go um so yeah I
and I already threw out their name coin
whatever claims Bitcoin lab is basically
saying that they're not gonna deal with
anything yes attempted to be anonymous
yes that's uh that's the other thing is
i think i haven't both of them said that
maybe i'm not think so where they're
both saying this is just not gonna deal
so not everyone wants the US government
putting their nose all over bitcoin well
well okk this was a they seeds the
accounts that mount guards had in an
american bank account yes if mel conks
did not have that in american bank
account america would have not done
anything about it and if it wasn't being
used to log it allegedly serve all that
if it wasn't if they didn't have Sidon
suspect that it was being used for for
laundering money then it was being
ignored up till me yeah yeah so so those
are the two things one it was in the
States yeah and two it was possibly
being used for loaning money here's a
good one from ARS technica ah was this
yeah no not no knows me okay so hacker
serving actually here I'll let you
handle this one since so hacker is
serving a five-year sentence he helped
some gang Kurt gangster gangster Mulder
they could be gankers they're just
reeling money yeah gankers figures so
there you go guys you heard it here
first thieves are gankers what kind of
because they're hanging out at the ATM
and the gank your kind of it kind of
works actually their game cursed anyways
they're skimming your cards as you try
and put them into ATM machines so he got
caught and put in jail and to make
amends what he did was kind of solved
the problem that he was pushing forward
he's six months into his sentence in a
Romanian prison I wouldn't want to be in
a Romanian prison probably not that's
probably why he worked so hard anyways
he developed a system so that it will
rotate the card when it comes in
counteracting skimming machines that he
was putting out there so so pretty much
you take so for those of you who don't
look at the article on ARS technica
basically what it would amount to
is instead of inserting your card this
way because the way the skimmers were
working is they were reading the mag
strip on the back of a card as it went
in before it went in so what his device
does is it kind of like clamps on to the
old slot and allows you to insert your
card this way so you insert your card
sideways it flips it around and then
inserts it this way so that the machine
itself can read it but a skimmer
couldn't now it seems like a very
temporary fix yep but but still a
temporary fix pretty much every security
measure ever to be completely honest and
the computer world is a temporary fix no
was that your credit card no why because
people are like look at this part number
there's no way to can people to read my
card number the 720p and I'm back here
ok don't worry about it um yeah so I
don't know that's kind of cool that
should count for something yeah I hope
it helps his sentence well I think what
they're saying is so they're calling
this srs the secure revolving system
yeah um and I know he's being started up
by there we go yes srs development was
funded by a company called mb telecom
yep products being shopped around and
something something I think there's
something about how ah so the the
president told Reuters that he fully
deserves a recognition he's at least
taking part in improving romania's image
abroad and he'll surely join our team
when released this happened so much
that's cool this happens so much ok this
is the first time seen it was something
some form of hardware hacking but it's
so so so so common that someone will
break into say a bank not steal anything
not look at anyone's personal
information but just kind of sit there
and then either turn themselves in
directly to the bank or like bring
themselves in not get caught and then
get hired instead of arrested because
they'll be like you know what if you
hire me I can patch this hole and then
help defend you from then on yeah no
that's uh it almost seems like the way
to get a job I mean that sounds like got
his job here uh I'm the actual person
that stole your youtube account way back
yeah yeah and then he is all like yeah
don't worry I'll prevent anyone from
ever doing that again
bye bye bye you activating to stem yeah
yay ah that's not true by the way yeah
not not true at all so oh here's a
community news item that actually I
thought was pretty darn cool so the
apple app store just hit 50 billion
downloads this was contributed by holy
crap masseuses myth isn't Susan yeah the
thews and 55 743 so this was reported by
the verge here's the original link
Apple's got 50 billion downloads I mean
think about that they gave a
ten-thousand-dollar app store credit to
the person who downloaded the 50 billion
fat this is something that they've done
before and the first 50 people who
download an app after that each received
a five hundred dollar gift card so to
put this in context it took Apple so
here here they here there they have all
the numbers ah so the blah blah blah
September 2012 the play start hit 25
billion downloads and it's been
announced today that they're closing in
at 48 billion the Windows Phone store
has reached its first billion a few
months ago BlackBerry's appworld reach 2
3 billion downloads last year and where
was it I remember reading somewhere how
long it took them to reach the first
million downloads and basically the rate
at which apps are being downloaded these
days is absolutely insane and crazy and
I think it's really I think it's really
awesome yeah it's really cool I really
shows sort of where the market shares
that as well we kind of go yeah Apple
Apple Google where Apple had the long
head start oh I guess not that long but
they had a head start would pretty
substantial insert made a significant
head start over android and android
quite frankly sucked at the beginning
anyway so so yeah very very very cool 50
billion downloads I mean just
unfathomable numbers that's enough for
every person on earth to have like seven
apps
oh like what seriously yeah that's
actually kind of insane but you also got
to figure out there probably calculating
every time you like reset your phone
yeah oh yeah every time you restore apps
by every time yeah I know there's a lot
of arbitrary speaking of Android and the
experience sucking uh the experience
might be about to get better than
anything that we've ever seen before so
faunal or phone ill or whatever man you
guys got to have names I can pronounce
on the forum there ah so the original
article is from geek calm but at the
google i/o event Samsung made a huge
announcement and that is that the galaxy
s4 will have a stock vanilla Google
Experience discuss kind of talked about
this a little bit already when not a lot
but a little bit oh I'm a scream a
little bit yeah I didn't talked about
like I talked about how my favorite
phone was the next test okay hold on
before you talk okay hold that thought
don't forget okay while slick is talking
I want you guys on Twitter to tweet us
and let us know on a scale of 1 to 10
how mad are you if you already bought a
galaxy s4 with TouchWiz and now for what
is it six 49 in the Play Store yeah yeah
649 in the Play Store you can get an s4
that gets the Nexus treatment instant
google updates for the lifetime of the
device holy crap that makes it i mean it
has i mean it's crazy to me that it's
going to be a google device at all
because Google's trying to get away from
the three buttons on the bottom and
Samsung basically gave them the old on
that just did it anyway okay and um it's
got a microSD which Google wants to get
away from okay wait it's it's the deal
it's awesome I like okay so guys tell us
how mad you are back to the Nexus
experience I guess while we wait for
this I love my Nexus S because of the
updates going like crazy so I was not
that intrigued when s4 came out but now
I'm actually kind of intrigued I'm not
going to go step out and spend 650 bucks
on a new phone but it
viable now to upgrade from an s3 because
I see like the value in getting a phone
that will be updated by Google all the
time yeah and I mean Samsung notoriously
differentiates their phones by software
which is just not cool at all no um
apparently no one on Twitter wants to
talk about it and really mad what's the
deal oh there's one yeah alright so
let's go let's go to the Twitter boards
ah is this gonna happen to the Xperia Z
kind of doubt it only issue is will the
Nexus experience has four be cdma
compatible not I think are there like
one or two different phones something
versions but i can't remember getting it
yeah can't remember it okay so oh oh
there are a bunch of responses I just
couldn't find them yeah if i bought it i
would be ultra upset is the word that
bernardo meant to use you guys are
talking about the shield's streaming
there's an app called ke that does that
it works over 3g and 4g to that's very
cool okay uh i think you can just
download the rom and install it on your
samsung s4 if that's possible then
that's very cool yeah i would not be mad
because I would root the thing in a
heartbeat okay fair enough 9000 out of
10 mad because not everyone is
comfortable routing their phone just
throwing that out there the droid DNA
took me like four to six hours to route
and s off and whatever all the things
you have to do in order to end like get
the latest over-the-air update that
somehow made the phone not rootable it's
still not readable and so i had to do
all these things in a particular order
I'd never rooted a phone before it's not
that easy with some devices so not mad
because I got an iPhone 10 really mad
what's the deal um not at all thanks to
XDA developers which I should have used
already I am mad verizon locked down the
DNA when HTC had given it to us unlocked
for roms okay yeah yeah I'm mad about
that too they both have the same
hardware so anyone who wants talk badly
enough can find a rom update within a
day this is true we already talked about
this Sean first time watching live from
Tasmania hello apparently were goofy
awesome that must be Australian Lake
attempts at English my favorite
trillium whoa sorry guys I love you guys
favorite Australian thing is straya when
they literally just typed stray up Sammy
Oh like Australia but with a heavy
accent okay this is my favorite thing
ever it's so awesome listening to the
stream with wireless headphones that's a
good idea ah Casper 0i root can't care
don't care don't own an s4 but I'd be
mad OEM should support AOSP more often
like with Nexus it's a pain to get it to
work with the devices honestly I wish
even just to try it I wish I could try a
stock google experience on the HTC One
for example I understand why it's not
that easy and developing multiple
firmware streams and multiple software
streams is a problem I mean especially
with the hardware being so diverse on
the Android platform but it just yeah I
kind of wish I could at least try it
okay so you know what I think that's
pretty much it you want to do build logs
of the week sure and then we are going
to start we after a party ah should I go
get that ready sure I can do pill bugs
and Google already triple they won't so
guys we're gonna be doing super mario
live stream and uh uh peace slick just
stop it when you're done sure we'll
leave project cheapy okay i might stick
around finish which C is it 344 for a
limited time only by an Intel quo I
asked what seat it was on it on there
it's at four oh that's weird I don't
worry about it why would you there's a
cuz f1 always brings up help
why are you shelled on the pill box okay
so I'm gonna slow scroll through this
because I can barely use this keyboard
the first few pictures were just kind of
him getting ready and then he does a
test fit so don't worry no stock cpu
cooler just going to put that out there
right now so nobody freaks out there's
no stock cpu cooler he's just doing test
fit you do to do pretty nice leaving i
like it i will see when he does white
sleeving here he does assume in of it it
looks quite good where's the better zoom
in of it that rotational ring thing on
set on Coursera fans is actually like
the smartest thing that's really cool
because you can make it go to your
system so it's nice like it's nice that
he's sleeved it it's a little bit loose
sleeping you see that it's a little bit
loose leaving but you probably won't
notice that much unless you're really
looking really close so you start to see
it coming together sleepings kind of
crazy colors here but it ends up looking
awesome this took me off by a guard at
first was like what orientation is that
in it took me a little while to figure
it out and then I got pretty excited
because that looks very cool once you
actually get a seat in the build now you
start questioning things because you're
like wait he has a closed loop cooler
and there's a reservoir there he's got
tubing what's happening and I just got
oh this is so cool so he took a part is
closed loop cooler and adds a reservoir
to it which is awesome just totally
awesome so cool because I can because
you know what it looks way better that's
what I'm assuming he was taking because
it does it looks super cool guys own
tube he's got a reservoir in there it
didn't cost him way too much he does
somewhat Lee doesn't have the cost of
doing a whole custom water loop although
at this point it's basically old cuss
someone in it so it looks great he did a
little bit there you go there's a good
shot of the SSD you can see how it's
mounted there in the bottom right
vertically so it shows really really
well when you're looking saw the case
he's got a reservoir which makes the
whole thing like a billion times better
it's just very very cool little build
not a boy if you don't count the
reservoir not a ton of mod work although
he did sleeve all the way to the power
supply so I guess that's just totally
not true there's definitely a ton of mod
work
this great job I don't remember which
username this was Jeffrey Rodriguez good
job dude that was an awesome build that
was very very cool I'm going to switch
over to see one here we go sorry I'm not
so good at this let me God the other
build now to go to the complete other
spectrum of good-looking builds we get
my r4 which is easily the most creative
named thing I've ever seen so I don't
know what you guys are talking about he
doesn't have a ton of in progress shots
or zero but that's his computer no in
progress shots it's done I like this
build a lot because when I first saw it
my first reaction was like oh that's
photo booth or like light roomed because
it just seems like everything goes so
well together and then I realized that
it's actually probably not that's
probably exactly what it looks like he
pulled the label off the power supply
sleeved his psu and the whole thing
looks amazing not a ton of steps and it
looks absolutely fantastic I don't see a
ton of people pulling off labels of
power supplies I think he also pulled
the stickers off the top of his io ports
I'm gonna try and point with my mouse
for once so in here there were probably
originally some stickers in there this
is one thing i do that i do not see very
many people doing but i think it really
really improves it look at the bill
because when you have like until a
gigabit sticker that is totally in a
color profile that doesn't match the
rest of your build I don't think it
looks that great but yeah this bill just
looks so clean so insanely clean and not
the clean where it's like pearl white
clean this just looks crazy
sophisticated clean it's very very
nice-looking build gentle typhoons were
a perfect choice for the look of this
build absolutely perfect I've got some
in my build they look great they're very
simplistic but they look great it's just
minimalism you can tell with his
headphones on the headphone stand back
there which are awesome just I'm feeling
this guy's into minimalism his scale
management is great you did a really
good job who's got his SS the mounted
back there which is awesome I'm not a
huge fan of the SSD mounting in this
case because if i remember correctly you
have to
drew it in from behind the motherboard
so to take it off or put another one in
you'd have to take the motherboard out
which is a little bit annoying um yeah
it's just an awesome build and then and
then this is this is kind of my favorite
part very nice and grave keycaps those
are awesome nice keyboard he's got there
nice keyboards always I think tie
everything together and that's where you
can totally see people's kind of
personality come in because this is
where I got the affirmation that he was
into minimalism because checking out his
keyboard its just oh very very nice
build i'ma show you guys a little shot
of that again so thanks a lot for build
logs I want to do a quick shout out to
the Intel response team I don't have a
URL here but maybe one of my mods can
post it in twitch chat we are recruiting
people no one has gotten messages back
yet just by the way and if we don't
message you I'm sorry but we just have
tons of applicants you get in we will
message you will get that rolling until
response team is awesome the idea of the
Intel response team is your linus tech
tips for a member who has joined the
intel response team we do not want you
to answer any questions that you
wouldn't already answer and we don't
want to influence your answer if you
would normally suggest AMD to this
person please suggest AMD to that person
this is if you're joining until response
team if it's a use case that AMD makes
more sense do that we do not want to
influence your answer all the Intel
response team is for is that if someone
has an Intel processor or if someone is
interested in buying an Intel processor
that person should get a premium
experience so until once the sponsor the
team so what the team will get is swag
and prizes and they're pretty serious
swag and pretty serious prizes and it's
from Intel so if it's stuff that Intel
makes and it's fairly high end I'm not
saying exactly what it is but it's gonna
be good so the prizes are pretty awesome
they're giving them out on a monthly
basis it'll be basically you have to do
30 posts a month and it's not for Linus
tech tips for them you get an amount of
I'll explain the point system later
what's that okay there's a cat in here
he came in when you left less well okay
so you have to do 30 posts but we're
looking for post outside of the forum
and inside the forum the post about
Intel that are going to
be consumed within the last sec tips
forum they're going to go really fast so
basically if you only post on Linus tech
tips you probably won't be able to stay
because we need 30 posts from each
member every month and you won't be able
to get 30 posts every month with all the
other people answering questions you
have to be the best person there so it
has to be a long very very good answer
it's it's not it's not going to be super
easy this isn't for people that are
going to school and have a part-time job
and have no extra time it's just
reputable that have a lot of extra time
already post a ton on forums and not
already doing this kind of stuff this
isn't like a lifestyle change idea this
is we want to reward you for things that
you're already doing so if that sounds
like something that you're into I might
have missed some things check out the
post that wind speed made on our forum
hopefully he can post that like I said
earlier if that sounds like something
that you're into please apply we will be
going through applications very soon
well try and get this team up and
running one of the things I'm going to
throw out there that I think I can say
is one of the first swag items is going
to be team shirts and the team shirts
can have personalized names on the back
and we'll be like Intel response team
Intel response squad sorry and then your
forum handle which is going to be pretty
cool then i'll say until response squad
somewhere else I don't know yet we're
probably going to do a community
submitted shirt design for that but
we're definitely going to have
personalized names on the back so it's
going to be pretty awesome but like I
said it is going to take some work it's
not going to be that easy and we need
you month by month by month it's not
going to be one thing where you just
jump in for a month we need you to kind
of stay on the team so yeah if you are
actually interested in that please check
it out and I'll see you on the other
side because we're going to go to the
live stream thanks for watching if
you're tuning out now we will see you
next week or we'll see you on by a sec
tips youtube I have a good night
