Visionnaire mobility cordless color
scanner yes this is a bit of a deja vu
moment for you guys but I did make some
two mistakes and my previous unboxing
and first look at this unit so bear with
me here while I go through it again so
experience the freedom of true mobility
scan without a computer cables or
software you can do all of those things
so you can scan documents photos
business cards ID cards and receipts
we're gonna be scanning this photo okay
what else we gotta gear scan into a
smartphone SD card or USB flash drive
with no computer required to scan it
includes a 2gig SD card although the
packaging says one gig SD card we've got
300 dpi simplex scanning and color and
grayscale simplex means that is single
sided not dual sided okay rechargeable
battery so you can scan up to 300 scans
per charge so this box says 150 scans
per charge but this was a pre-release
box and it is actually 300 scans per
charge and you can charge it over USB or
by plugging into this guy and here we go
there's your power and plugging this
into the unit so you can either plug
these two into a computer or you can
plug it into the wall and it comes with
a couple multinational adapter so it
comes with this guy and it also comes
with this guy your oh guy okay we got
here so let's go let's get people sorry
about that guy's battery you know how it
is so I'm gonna go ahead and take these
scanner out of the box here we've
already got the charger that aside and
then we've got the accessory package
here which because this unit has been
unboxed once before by some dastardly
fellow who's me the micro SD card that's
included with the adapter is already
installed in said adapter so
just go ahead and here we go
there you go so let's go ahead and plug
that in so here you go these are your
options so you can scan to a USB Drive
and then this USB port is the one that's
for charging or for pulling data off the
off of the scanner and then there ya off
of the for scanning directly to an
actual computer this is a cleaning swab
so you can use that to keep the lamp
clean okay
I'm sure which side you actually access
it from so I'm not gonna sort of overdo
that they actually got some indicators
here in terms of the different sizes of
things so no staples paper goes in this
way here is for a six photos a four and
cards okay you can actually scan plastic
cards in it as well which is something I
don't think I mentioned last time around
so here is what we're going to do I'm
just gonna really the the functionality
of this device that I see is primarily
for business you nurse users I mean how
often do you you know someone like a
contractor for example I could see using
something like this on them all the time
you're on a job site you need to
probably yeah here's a calibrator sheet
so you just use that to get a baseline
reading so you're a contractor or
something there's some document that you
want to scan and like sign so that
someone can have a look at it and if you
have one of these on you then you'd be
able to do it sorry I wasn't really
going anywhere with that I guess let's
do our photo first so it feeds in this
way I'm lining that up with the photo
line let's give it a second
I'd have to feed it a little bit sort of
more
well I failed hold on a minute you know
it's funny because I've done this once
already and I still can't remember how
to do it you know I turned it off oh
there we go ha ha we're good
you know we should also try a plastic
card here as well so let me just see if
there's anything in my card that doesn't
you know reveal all the information in
the world about me ah there we go I can
scan my my NCIX advantage club
membership as soon as I tape off the
name of the person to whom this card
used to belong there we go okay so let's
go ahead and let's throw a party to you
now okay the flashing lights I guess
means it's processing something
so let's come ahead or maybe that means
it's ready I don't know nope not ready
yet
there we go okay yeah now it's ready
so the solid light means it's ready and
go ahead and run that through so let's
go check out our results shall we guys
okay guys so I've got an SD card reader
on the side of this monitor so we're
gonna go ahead and open it up DCIM image
3 is our photo that we scan so there you
go
and then image 4 is my NCIX
advantage membership card a couple other
things that I haven't mentioned yet is
this button right here is for removing
jams in the event of a jam so what it
does is it lifts up the rollers so that
you can pull a piece of paper out of it
without risking damaging it and yes I
confirmed that once these lights stopped
flashing that means the unit is ready to
scan so that was the difficulty I was
having feeding documents through the
scanner so thank you for checking out my
Rhian boxing and free first look I guess
second look at this point of the
Visioneer mobility scanner don't forget
