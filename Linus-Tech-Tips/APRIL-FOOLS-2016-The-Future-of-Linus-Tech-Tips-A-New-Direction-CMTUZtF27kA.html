last few weeks - tech tips as content
just hasn't been very good and while
some of you have bought into the
plausible explanations we've offered to
this like oh we're busy working on
scrapyard Wars season 4 others haven't
been so easily fooled
but the time for clues and hints is over
and it's with great pleasure that today
I will finally reveal to everyone the
reason for all the crappy content I
think what warming warming pizza of a
computer paintings your video card so
effective today I'm announcing my
retirement from making YouTube videos
and an exciting agreement that we've
reached with Nvidia to acquire Linus
Media Group and all of its assets now
some of you may be wondering why I
decided to make this dramatic move but
I'm sure to others the answer is obvious
I'm just playing out of ideas but the
good news is that NVIDIA has lots of
their own ideas for how to revitalize
the channel while selling more video
cards and reducing overhead to increase
the new Nvidia Media Group's profits for
example we can liquidate all our other
table cloths this is the only color
we'll need now tech quickie videos will
encode faster than ever there will be no
need to replace the background with a
white one and of course we won't have to
review products with RGB lighting
anymore because there's only one color
that we need and while I know that some
of you will be worried about what this
means for our unbiased editorial content
in the future I want to assure you that
everything you loved about Linus tech
tips will remain exactly the way it was
just with a little more green to the
future boys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
