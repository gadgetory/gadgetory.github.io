case wait please don't hit the dislike
button okay
I'm gonna confess I'm unboxing this
because they messaged me on youtube snot
did that is and they said would you like
one of our cases we noticed you have an
iPad and I said sure and they said well
then can you do a video about it I said
sure so yes I am doing this video just
so that I can get this iPad case for my
iPad 2 now that I've said that you've
probably already hit the dislike button
and I guess I don't blame you because
I've pretty much sold out on this one
but the fact that I am going to give it
a positive video is not so much an
indication that I am selling out but
rather an indication that I was already
interested in the snug ultra-thin case
for the iPad 2 before I asked to get one
so as long as it meets my expectations
than I am expecting that my expectations
will be met and I will be happy with it
okay less than 14 millimeters when
holding iPad to protect both the front
and back of iPad 2 and I will explain
why that is important at this time and
the funny thing about this is I actually
you know I'll tell the story after
magnetic cover for instant on an optical
and fold into an approach at appropriate
angle for viewing and writing okay so
let's have a look first of all I'm going
to show you guys something then if you
hit the dislike button already you're
probably gonna hit the like button right
about now okay so first there's a
scratch on the back of my iPad 2 because
apparently I don't believe in cases can
you see that scratch No okay well it's
pretty good it's pretty good it's pretty
significant but that is not the part
that really choose me up inside the part
that well sorry hold on I got some
notifications here and I have to go
ahead and go back to the hold on oh man
really come on come on okay there yeah
this is the part that really makes me
wish that I was using a case on my iPad
to at all times I broke my iPad to I was
sitting on the couch
guys sitting on the couch and I kinda
had like half of my keys and all my
stuff in my pockets and I didn't realize
that I had tossed my iPad 2 onto the
floor in front of me and took my keys in
my pocket and went like this and they
struck it struck my iPad - which now has
a big huge cracked the horrible thing
here and it has a hairline crack that
runs all the way down here turns out it
cost about 200 to 250 bucks to replace
the glass so I won't be doing it but in
order to prevent any further damage I
will be adding a case to my iPad - so
snug it has allowed me to do that - yes
alright so here is a soft non-scratch
ease surface so it won't scratch the
back which is already scratched and will
scratch the glass which is cracked and
horrible and yeah I hate that okay so
you basically take your iPad - and you
put it in here
snaps into place little something like
that okay you just see let me just see
if it snapped into place like that huh
last one there we go so it's now in
place and then it goes like that so oh
yeah that is actually really thin check
that out
so here hold on let me go get another
tablet you know what just come with me
okay so let's go get another tablet and
we'll compare the thickness of the iPad
2 with the snug case to the Motorola
Xoom with no case and I suspect that it
will still be thinner or about as thin
as the Motorola Xoom let's just there we
go okay let's go back let's go back when
the light is good there I'm gonna put
them on the table and you can compare
the thickness for yourself oh that's
actually very similar okay
so with the snug ultra thin case for
iPad 2 it is about the thickness of a
Motorola Xoom you can go like this and I
think it works the same way as that
magic thing but I don't think is magic
yeah you fold it in a triangle and that
goes like that I think not right okay
slick says I'm right so there's like
this or this or this although I have no
idea how this works okay let's try and
figure this out
so really I don't think that seems very
likely hold on I think he's telling me
I'm doing it wrong hmm oh yeah okay cool
so like this see I struggle with Apple
things I may use them from time to time
but it makes you guys feel any better I
do struggle okay well I'm not convinced
about this one but it definitely does
this and let's see if we can do this ah
it does this which is as good as this
anyway so there you go that's actually
oh hey look at that that's really solid
I tried this with the magic ones before
the Apple one it actually wasn't the
solid so yeah it doesn't move like at
all pretty good okay so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the snug
ultra-thin case for iPad 2 don't forget
