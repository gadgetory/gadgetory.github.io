case wait please don't hit the dislike
button okay I'm gonna confess I am
unboxing this because they messaged me
on youtube snot did that is and they
said would you like one of our cases we
noticed you have an iPad and I said sure
and they said well then can you do a
video about it I said sure so yes I am
doing this video just so that I can get
this ipad case for my ipad 2 now that
I've said that you've probably already
hit the dislike button and I guess I
don't blame you because I've pretty much
sold out on this one but the fact that i
am going to give it a positive video is
not so much an indication that i am
selling out but rather an indication
that i was already interested in the
snug ultra-thin case for the ipad to the
fore i asked to get one so as long as it
meets my expectations than i am
expecting that my expectations will be
met and i will be happy with it okay
less than 14 millimeters when holding
iPad to protect both the front and back
of ipad 2 and i will explain why that is
important at this time I'm the funny
thing about this is i actually okay you
know it i'll tell the story after
magnetic cover for instant on an optical
and fold into an approach at appropriate
angle for viewing and writing okay so
let's have a look first of all i'm going
to show you guys something then if you
hit the dislike button already you're
probably going to hit the like button
right about now okay so first there's a
scratch on the back of my ipad too
because apparently I don't believe in
cases can you see that scratch no okay
well it's pretty good it's pretty good
it's pretty significant but that is not
the part that really choose me up inside
the part that well sorry held on I got
some notifications here and I have to go
ahead and go back to the hold on oh man
really come on come on okay there yeah
this is the part that really makes me
wish that I was using a case on my iPad
2 at all times I broke my ipad 2 i'm
sitting on the couch
gasps sitting on the couch and I kind of
had like half of my keys and all my
stuff in my pockets and I didn't realize
that I had tossed my ipad2 onto the
floor in front of me and took my keys in
my pocket I want like this and they
struck struck my ipad 2 which now has a
big huge cracked horrible thing here and
it has a hairline crack that runs all
the way down here turns out it costs
about 200 to 250 bucks to replace the
glass so I won't be doing it but in
order to prevent any further damage I
will be adding a case to my ipad 2 so
snug it has allowed me to do that too
yes all right so here is a soft non
scratchies surface so it won't scratch
the back which is already scratched and
will scratch the glass which is cracked
and horrible and all yeah I hate that
okay so you basically take your ipad 2
and you put it in here snaps into place
little something like that okay hold on
I'm just see let me just see if it snaps
into place like that huh last one there
we go so it's now in place and then it
goes like that so oh yeah that is
actually really thin check that out so
here hold on let me go get another
tablet I know what just come with me
okay so let's go get another tablet and
we'll compare the thickness of the ipad
2 with the snug case to the motorola
xoom with no case and i suspect that it
will still be dinner or about as thin as
the motorola xoom so let's just grab
that ah ah there we go okay let's go
back let's go back where the light is
good ah here I'm gonna put them on the
table and you can compare the thickness
for yourself oh that's actually very
similar okay so with the snug ultra thin
case for ipad 2 it is about the
thickness of a motorola xoom you can go
like this and I think it works the same
way as that magic thing if I don't think
is magic but
hold on yeah you fold it in a triangle
and it goes like that i think not right
okay slick says I'm right so there's
like this or this or this although I
have no idea how this works okay let's
try and figure this out so really i
don't think that seems very likely hold
on i think he's telling me i'm doing it
wrong hmm oh yeah okay cool so like this
see I struggle with Apple things I may
use them from time to time but it makes
you guys feel any better I do struggle
okay well I'm not convinced about this
one but it definitely does this and
let's see if we can do this ah it does
this which is as good as this anyway so
there you go that's actually oh hey look
at that that's really solid I tried this
with the magic one before the apple one
it actually doesn't the solid so yeah it
doesn't move like at all pretty good
okay so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the snug ultra thin case for
ipad 2 don't forget to subscribe to
