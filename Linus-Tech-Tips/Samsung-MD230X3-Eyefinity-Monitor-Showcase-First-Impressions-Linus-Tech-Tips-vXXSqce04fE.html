triple panel display the box of which is
here I've already done the unboxing I
have done two things first I assembled
it and second I realized what the part
number means and him MD multi display
230 that is twenty three point zero
inches x 3 x 3 so it's actually fairly
self-explanatory
I guess if they released another one it
would be called MD 230 X 3 V 2 how you
might guess I could be wrong anyway so
we've got it set up with the triple
monitor stand and yeah I'm not going to
let you look at the back yet I'm just
going to let you bask in the triple
monitor glory that is this this setup so
as I mentioned in the unboxing
it's about out ouch it's about the width
of my outstretched arms in terms of your
your visible area okay if the stand is a
little wider than one of them and it
actually is height adjustable which is
pretty darn cool okay and where was that
mark said going with this it's so
freakin cool so we are going to run some
games on this at some point I haven't
decided whether it'll be on my - tech
tips blog or my NCIX comm channel so
make sure you're subscribed to both so
that you don't miss that because we're
going to get some Eyefinity action going
on on here and I did figure out what the
little and yes they are magnetic strips
the little magnetic strips are for that
I found in the unboxing there to put on
the sides of the monitor to cover up the
kind of odd industrial finish that this
monitor has so camera head you can come
around to the back and don't catch
yourself in the mirror there so check
this out so what this is sort of the
comment I was making a minute ago is
that this setup is probably as close as
you could ever get to a custom
manufacture just for you setup from
Samsung because you look at this the fit
and finish of it while very industrial
very rugged very all of that is clearly
not mass production I mean this is like
this is like stamped pieces
of sheet metal with you know like
ventilation holes and then it's like
screwed together and you drill holes
through it it's like it's like it was
assembled like like just custom like
they found a Samsung panel and they just
like built an enclosure around it just
for this which is pretty sweet so I want
to show you guys how the cable
management works on the back because
it's not simple okay so first of all
you've got power so you can daisy chain
the monitors together so that you only
actually have to run a single power cord
up to the entire setup so my power cord
is going into this one and then out from
there to this one and then out from
there to this one here back up a little
bit so I can show you sort of the whole
the whole look okay I'm using DVI on the
two outside panels and running the DVI
cables over here and down and then I
have a display port cable here okay and
then for USB because we do need USB I've
got the control pod plugged in over here
and the control pod is here right now
so that means you can sort of sit it
right there in front of the monitor and
then there is a control in and control
up so I plug the control plotted to
control in and control out in to control
it and then control up in to control in
finally on the third one then the whole
thing the only way I was able to get it
tidally and that is without sort of I
could do it a little bit better if it
was at home and I was going to be set up
like this for good but I was to use some
kind of a tie around the bottom here and
run the whole whack of cables down the
back so what we end with end up with at
the bottom is to DVI one power and one
DisplayPort to get this whole honkin
thing running I think there was
something else that I still wanted to
say oh yeah yeah I haven't shown you
guys the hinge so the hinges as you can
see I've adjusted them come to have a
look from top down on these so as you
can see I have adjusted them so they are
at their full 30 degree angle but you
can also run it completely flat if you
prefer the setup for this thing actually
to put together the monitor itself took
very little time at all I was done in
about five minutes
whereas doing all the cabling actually
took me about 20 minutes so that's
that's
time consuming part here come have a
look at it from the front over here make
sure you don't catch yourself in the
window cuz I know you're about to yeah
that's right okay so this is what it
looks like if you run it flat and then
just for perspective here it is with my
arm span again so you can see how long
this panel thing is so as I mentioned in
the unboxing you can actually set it up
differently you can have them all um
vertical if you want and then that's
that's a slightly different look so
it'll be less wide but more tall if you
set it up that way so thank you for
checking out my detailed impressions on
the ND 230 X 3 so yeah that I got it
right even though I didn't cheat MD 230
XE yep and yeah don't forget to stay
tuned because we are definitely going to
be seeing this thing in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
