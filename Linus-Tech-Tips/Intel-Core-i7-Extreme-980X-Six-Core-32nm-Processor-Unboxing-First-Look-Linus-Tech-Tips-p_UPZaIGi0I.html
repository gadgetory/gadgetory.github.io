saddle so I've got a very exciting
product today to unbox this is the Intel
Core i7 980 X it's an LGA 1366 processor
and we've seen that before but what's
new about it is this is a six core
Extreme Edition processor now just like
when Intel launched the QX 6700 this is
the only processor that you can buy from
Intel on the desktop platform with six
cores so the QX 6700 was an extreme
processor and it was the only four core
you could buy at the time so you're
paying a premium but you're getting the
latest technology this is a 32 nanometer
processor it supports hyper threading
technology which means 12 threads and
task manager go figure
turbo boost it has an integrated memory
controller triple channel ddr3 memory
like all of the LGA 1366 CPUs it is
compatible with most and it should be
all x58 motherboards with only a BIOS
update so I threw one of these chips
into my one year old x58 board and it
worked just with a BIOS update so then
let's go around to the back this box
contains an Intel processor and thermal
solution it is a three year warranty ok
so let's go around here ok why don't we
break the seal on this bad boy so here
we go that is a thousand plus dollar
processor now it's open we opened the
box let's see what kind of experience we
have unboxing a core i7 extreme so this
is cool intel has actually updated their
stock cooler for the extreme edition
products but before we get into that we
have a look at the documentation oh wow
this is kind of a complicated package
the CPUs in like a cardboard container
so we'll look at that after first of all
we have the installation instructions
along with the three year limited
warranty we have an Intel Inside logo
label core i7 inside it's a black one
because it's extreme alright next we
have Oh
this is new look at this Intel actually
includes a thermal compound tube this
looks like it's probably shin-etsu I'm
guessing though I'm just going based on
the based on the syringe here Dow
Corning no this is it's a no Liam it's
an OEM paste if it's what I think it is
it's a very high quality paste and then
they include an installation instruction
guide for how to apply the the syringe
to your CPU I also have a video about
that which you could also watch on my
NCI x-column account okay so then we
have a clamshell plastic package and the
new Intel stock cooler which I've also
done a video on my Linus tech tips
channel about outlining the the
differences between this are just
looking at it okay so the biggest
difference is let's start with the
obvious one this is a heat pipe cooler
so it has four heat pipes that all
connect directly to a copper base and
then aluminum fin tower design just like
many of the aftermarket coolers over the
past couple years whereas Intel has been
using a top-down blower for years and
years and years they have to change that
for aeons it seems like okay next thing
is it uses thumb screws to secure to the
motherboard as well as a backplate Intel
in the past has been using pushpins
plastic pushpins I hate these things
this is way better I love it okay next
thing it uses a bowed base you can't see
that here but the base is actually
convex which means that when you put it
down on the CPU and tighten it down it
gets incredibly tight mounting pressure
in the center right over the die of the
CPU that's very important too this is a
feature that's been carried over from
previous extreme edition heat sinks in
that you can set it to either quiet or
performance mode with the push of a
button okay let's have a look at the
fins from the side so you can kind of
see through them there and then it has a
sleeve power connector that's something
that I've wanted to see on stock coolers
for a long time because you know what it
just makes it that much tidier when
you're trying to do a nice build and you
got like your blue and yellow and green
and black
random wire all over the place alright
next thing right this is actually really
cool so see this fan that is kind of a
weird shape so it's not actually
designed to just blow right through the
fins like most of the aftermarket
coolers are the reason for that is that
in a properly SPECT cooler you should
actually be blowing not only through the
fins to cool the CPU but you should
actually be cooling all of the
components around the CPU and for a long
time that's been the disadvantage to
using a tower cooler because usually the
fan blows only through the fins and it
doesn't reach the surrounding components
but what Intel's done is they've angled
the fan blades so that it actually
pushes a lot of air kind of around this
way and it also pushes it down here and
just sort of randomly around the socket
so that enables Intel to get proper
cooling of all the components around the
socket and still use a tower cooler
amazing so now let's finish up the
unboxing and product overview as I
mentioned before this is a six core
processor clocked at three point three
three gigahertz it has all right let's
get this cardboard thing I've never seen
it Intel CPU box like this very strange
so they've changed a lot of things let's
have a look here so it has 12 Meg's of
cash it uses hmm yeah it uses a six
point four gigahertz qpi link and that
is pretty much all there is to it let's
flip it over it looks just like any LGA
1366 CPU that we've seen over the last
year plus except for what's under the
hood so that's six cores of
high-performance computing power I
should probably also mention that I was
able to effortlessly overclock the
sample that I already have to four
gigahertz just by turning up the
multiplier so it's an extreme addition
processor designed for overclocking and
looking cool and extreme thanks for
