suite actually but we're only sort of in
the gigabyte suite and don't worry I
will explain this you know all of this a
little bit later Linus tech tips
coverage of CES 2016 is brought to you
by Squarespace
build it at R active to the eye also
known as beautiful so we're actually on
the ARS side of things that's a sub
brand that they have for gaming
notebooks and they're showing off a
couple of pretty cool things so first up
is the oil heiress x7 DT so the DT is
for determination because a horas was
determined to take a desktop GPU and I'm
sure the DT has nothing to do with that
in this case the gtx 980 and cram it
into not just any old 17 inch laptop
because we've seen 980 based laptops
kind of all over the place at this point
but to do it in their signature thinner
form factor so it also features a
refreshed skylake processor ddr4 ram m
dot 2 storage has got a 17 inch screen
that same signature aluminum
construction that is as beautiful to the
touch as it is to the eye but now with
even more performance now remember the
thing about the GTX 980 in a laptop is
that we don't know exactly how it's
going to handle its power and thermal
limits so maybe we'll have to check this
one out in the future let me know if you
guys want to see that but I am
definitely excited to see where they're
going with this one in terms of i/o
they've made some upgrades as well so on
the right side you got your USB 3 you've
got your HDMI you've got your mini
DisplayPort and yes that is USB 3.1 with
a type-c connector unfortunately not
Thunderbolt however at the back is power
as well as another USB 3 and over here
on the left next to their G keys those
are programmable macro keys actually
they've got some new macro functionality
including like profiles that you can
create for different EQ settings and all
that depending on application signal so
that's kind of neat then they've got
Gigabit Ethernet HDMI VGA another USB
3.0 and audio now the one thing that I
continue to criticize about ARS laptops
is the fact that they use a glossy that
is a smooth glass touchpad so they're
half of the way they
glass is good but I'd like to see
frosted they've got another model here
that's pretty similar to the previous x5
as well but with one key change now it's
still available in the dual 965 M SLI
configuration but in addition to some
updated i/o so again we've got USB 3.1
type C this time over on the left side
this puppy features up to a 970 m single
graphics card if you prefer the non SLI
gaming experience which brings us of
course to the last thing here in the a
or a suite that we're talking about and
the reason for the get up here this is
their new well not new because it
doesn't exist yet but whatever upcoming
limited edition versions of the X 7 X 5
and X 3 the main difference between
these and the other ones is they have
severely downgraded the specs and it is
all about the looks just kidding
it's exactly the same laptop so you get
the same aluminum construction but
they're using water transfer technology
to use this like super hyper thin film
and then they take the components of the
chassis itself and they kind of like dip
it into the water that holds the film on
top which allows this camo finish that
they've developed which is actually
based on a multicam like legit military
finish to be not only on the flat
surfaces like you'd be able to do with a
traditional vinyl wrap but also on
things like even you know fan or speaker
grilles without losing any of the
overall pattern now each of these is
basically hand done and they're not no
two are going to look the same but with
that said if you guys are like well I
would want to look the same as that
anyway because it's like camo well
actually you may have an opportunity to
influence future ARS design so they
actually allow you to submit ideas
through their form that's where this
whole thing came from and if you're like
yeah you know I'd love one that had like
he's super like completely different
design this technology allows them to do
pretty much anything it's really cool
and depending on the region the specs of
the limited editions ones will vary but
as
assuming that the specs were apples to
apples it only adds about $100 to the
cost of the laptop and makes it really
freakin unique looking so guys thanks
