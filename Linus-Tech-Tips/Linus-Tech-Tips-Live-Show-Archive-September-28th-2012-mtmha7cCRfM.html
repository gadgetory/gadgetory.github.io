Theresa various it's not the real live
stream I'm just getting everything going
right now making sure Firefox is my
default browser which is a very
important thing to do because Firefox is
pretty much the bomb I also need to
actually open up the twitch TV chat so
that I can sort of monitor what you guys
are doing over there set up some
moderators 50 TVs ash linus tech i also
made the youtube video a little bit
early this week so I screwed up and it
said the live stream is now and so if
anyone actually follows this over here
from YouTube then they'll be really
disappointed if there's no live stream
and I didn't want anyone from YouTube to
be disappointed tonight and I don't want
anyone from from twitch to be
disappointed either there's a red dot
holy crap look at the look at the chat
there's a red dot Wow all right there we
are hey everybody how's my sound tonight
is it better are we good are we cool
it's way better right yes yeah we know
it's live you guys you guys in the chat
you guys are unbelievable how many times
do you need to say that it's live
there's a red thing in the corner yeah
we don't have any topics yet so i'm i'm
just here kind of chilling for now i do
have some topics for tonight i'm gonna
put them i'll put them here in my chrome
window Sam doing something with them
seeing I'm putting them there and then
I'm going to change back to that okay
topics for tonight someone wanted me to
do a Linus career tips segment so hey
right I mean if you're going to take
advice for my guidance counselor than
you might as well take advice from me
not that there's anything wrong with
being a guidance counselor it's just
like I don't think anyone goes to their
guidance counselor's office and they're
like yeah I really want to be a guidance
counselor how to buy a GV just like you
I just I just don't think it happens I
mean it might I could be totally wrong I
would I mean shout out to all the
guidance counselors in the audience
thank you for guiding us I mean I was
having a funny conversation with someone
this must have been about it must spend
about two days ago
and basically I was marveling at the job
that I have because it wasn't that long
ago that YouTube didn't exist I mean I
graduated from high school in 2004 which
basically means that YouTube didn't
exist yet and I had actually completely
forgotten that there was no YouTube when
I was still in school so how could any
guidance counselor have told me that I
could you know I'm gonna turn off the
audio monitoring here cuz it's driving
me crazy I can hear this echo in my head
so I was marveling that I know guidance
counselor could have ever told me oh
yeah you know what you can you can be
like a YouTube guy as like a job and
that can be part of your job or it can
be your whole job or it can be or it can
be anything and fr right on time because
we are just starting actually in five
minutes this is just the the pre-show so
maybe you know what maybe I'll do that
story later I'm gonna be like the radio
where I pre-announce what stuff i'm
going to talk about and then I actually
don't talk about it for like 15 minutes
and they make you guys sit through
commercials let's do like let's do an
iphone commercial do do do do do I don't
remember the Apple music
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo that is a pre-show
dance I me and singing I'm singing and
dancing what do you guys mean do a
pre-show to the outlaw don't I know
right uh hold on I gotta pop out the
chat as well let me just hold on ah
first first wait first let me just make
a note in my topics for tonight email
thread that I started to myself I mean
who emails themselves do you guys a mail
yourself are you like a grocery shopping
and you're like oh that's a great idea
and you just send yourself an email I do
it all the time i actually get as many
emails for myself as i get from anyone
else so i need to tell the story oh crap
i don't even remember what story I was
telling anymore tell the story about
guidance counselor's counselors I don't
remember how to spell counselors but
it's not auto correcting me so let's
assume that that's right alright sweet
so I need to see who all is in the chat
here so I can see if I have any
moderators tonight oh I've got fuzzy
otter balls
sweet and I have for moderators what do
you guys think is for moderators enough
for tonight we had some spam last week
and I was pretty obnoxious and I do like
to have the chat on fast mode I do
prefer that ah need more need more how
to be mod this guy is a moderator in the
future alright fo you can be oh no you
can't be a moderator I don't even see
the option here a couple more mods
wouldn't hurt all right Lily okay it's
moving too fast it's moving too fast how
do I freeze it think you guys did hey
fuzzy otter balls you guys need other
than fast mode and slow load you need a
freeze button so i can just freeze it
for a sec unless you have that and i
just don't see it yeah i don't see that
so yeah fuzzy otter balls a great idea
free of charge freeze mode um okay try
and try and hit someone here I'm not
even getting the option you know what
for should be enough for should be
enough how many people do we have
watching The Scream safar well we've got
500 people watching and the show hasn't
even started yet I should do this
pre-show thing more often because
apparently you guys will watch even when
I'm not doing any kind of a live show I
should just not do a live show at all I
should just do a live stream about how
I'm not doing a live show tonight maybe
that'll be next week can I get some can
I get some votes for that idea what do
you guys think pretty good pretty cool
all right let me move this let's move
this twitch chat thing here I'm gonna
move the the livestream monitoring
things so that I don't have to look at
it I'm just going to keep it open in the
corner there so I can make sure it's
actually working so guys I have made
some serious serious upgrades to my
setup tonight and I want to tell you all
about it in the two minutes leading up
to our live stream so number one is I
have replaced the headset i was using
before that ancient ass steelseries are
rather steelseries no sennheiser 1 i've
replaced that with a SteelSeries 7h
which I love and the mic is awesome and
the headphones are awesome and I have
also changed I have found that the best
sound card solution is these owner you
three so this is a little USB sound card
that's fantastic I know the audio is
cracking I touched the itouch the mic if
there's some weirdness going on that's
why I have I have the cap like propped
under it here so that it
foobar itself also I have stopped using
my power line connection and I have run
an ethernet cable from all the way
upstairs like through that door over
there upstairs to my switch and I have a
full gigabit connection down here this
time so no more wireless no more power
line I'm in the kitchen so there's a lot
of powerful devices going on around here
that are that are like they're lined in
their power and they're interfering with
my powerline network it's just not
working for me I'm getting like three
and a half megabytes per second overall
and plus it's recording my livestream
that I'm doing here to mine as at the
same time as I'm streaming its I think I
just don't have the network bandwidth
for it so having that gigabit pipe is
going to make things so much better and
madness XL says Linus please read this
and I did but I didn't see the point
because you didn't actually say anything
but I think you would hmm this is weird
but my quality is really not that great
yeah I know I know it's not that great
but it's better than before which is
important actually we've got my gear is
on its way if you guys are following me
on Twitter then you'll probably already
know this but if you're not following me
on Twitter you should follow me at linus
tech that's an @ sign like you know
Twitter thing at i'm new to twitter so
it's sorry too it's sort of confusing to
me like when I'm reading tweets on like
something something at minus tech but
what they actually mean is just
something something line is tech and it
just blows my mind but yeah if you
follow me on Twitter then you already
know i just spent 13 grand yes that's 13
with 3 more zeros after it on new gear
00 and like yeah it hurts me i actually
got my shipping notification yesterday
so i bought myself an fs700 yes that is
an eighty five hundred dollar camera
with the kit lens mm I bought myself a
new shotgun mic I bought myself to two
HDMI capture cards so we are going to be
doing an a roll and Abby role in future
unboxings we're going to have two rolls
I bought myself a new tripod
new head for the tripod uh what else did
I get I got new lights I got keno flows
it cost me three grand for two of these
things two kits with stands so we are
talking some serious serious upgrading
in terms of the quality around here
because right now i am using a webcam
and i am using this microphone i'm
choosing this sound card and i'll also
be using a desktop to capture all of the
all of the video and all of the audio in
the future which is I mean I love this
MSI notebook i really do it's just it's
a notebook and I I heart my desktop
experience the curry was amazing by the
way you must follow me on Twitter
whatever your name is I missed it but
it's the chat is moving so fast that I
can't even do it but yes the curry is
excellent the yes see that right there
that is where the coconut rice lives see
that's my tiger rice cooker and that
right there dad is where the curry is
and you are like so not having any I am
so I'm so keeping that curry for myself
I'm gonna have curry for breakfast
tomorrow it's gonna be outstanding and
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna it's gonna
hurt me all day you guys are telling me
to slow down are you telling me to light
on ice cream on my pc that's a fantastic
question so i have a new baby at home he
is five months old now and he is
sleeping this time of night i know i've
been asked quite a few times to adjust
the timing of my livestream so that i do
them earlier in the day for people who
live on the east coast but the problem
is that i just got home from work an
hour and a half ago and i knew that i
had to figure out this microphone and i
had to figure out that ethernet cable so
if i committed to a start time of eight
o'clock or seven o'clock my time or
anything like that and i would have had
a real problem because i wouldn't have
made it in time so there you go that's
that's pretty much the deal you know
what I'm I'm going to pause for a second
here i want to check youtube really
quick just to make sure that my link is
correct i mean we've got a fair number
of people watching the livestream
already but you know i just it never
hurt i mean i know i know what community
made me big and I i love i love twitch
and i love that you know people are
following me on twitch and that's that's
really cool stuff yep he says murder
link is fail it looks like I put the
wrong link in my video I do that kind of
thing w wh okay hold on now the link is
fine what's he talking about link is
fail I'll show you a fail link i'll copy
and paste it back in just in case I
screwed it up the first time there we go
alright but yeah so I hope that some of
you twitchers are starting to follow
along here and I know that I need to do
more like gaming hardware type of QA
otherwise there's zero justification for
having me on this website whatsoever but
there's just so much stuff that people
are asking that's not really that
related to that I will be taking
questions on Twitter tonight by the way
guys I know that not all of you like
Twitter and yeah there's just not a
whole lot I can do about that because
Twitter is one of the most convenient
ways for me to manage incoming questions
because I can control how quickly they
come in whereas the twitch chat is is
pretty difficult for me two for me two
for me to monitor I mean stuffs coming
in so so fast mel ova army says you have
an sv650 i do I have an sv650s and i am
super-duper disappointed because my
insurance ran out today so today was my
last day to ride it and i wasn't able to
ride it because i was too tired this
morning and it's not safe to ride if
you're tired ah yeah so that that again
yeah that was that was super discipline
communi i'm having a hard time signing
into twitter over here so i'm going to
have to go find myself a browser where
i'm already signed into twitter and i'll
try using that one maybe if i hadn't
talked so much during the part of this
pre livestream thing where I wasn't
supposed to be talking so much maybe if
I hadn't done that I would be ready by
the time the live stream was actually
rolling let's see oh okay good good good
good good i think it's open in firefox
okay let's
where's my where's my firefox where's my
firefox where's my twitter come on need
my twitter there we go yes i have
twitter now I was gonna have twitter
open in in Safari just to troll you guys
and I was going to see if anyone noticed
but it looks like we're just going to
stick with good old good old Firefox
pretty much the best browser ever it
crashes on me all the time but it's
still better than everything else so
that should tell you what I think of
pretty much everything else there is out
there I'll show us your baby my babies
in one of the videos that I've done so
far and um yeah he's I think he's pretty
cute I tweet pictures of him every once
in a while I think I was saying
something about Twitter yes i'll be
taking questions predominantly on
twitter predominantly like this so that
that will be the main way of us of us
handling questions here tonight okay so
let's kick this off let's start with my
thing about guidance counselor so I was
I was marveling to to a friend that
actually two things I was marveling to a
friend about that thing I talked about
last week where kids today aren't going
to know how to get anywhere because
they're just going to rely on GPS for
everything and we were talking about
just how fast the world's changing and I
mean it's it's crazy but it's almost
been 10 years since I was in high school
and I don't really I don't really feel
that much older but here I am i've been
at a job like in a career for 67 years
now i have a baby i'm married i've
bought a house so life is life is kind
of just going like this right and so
yeah so YouTube didn't start till 2004
and i graduated in 2004 which basically
means that when I sat down and I was
talking to my guidance counselor we
talked about a lot of things we talked
about you know at the time I wanted to
be a teacher or you know I wanted to get
like a science degree and then I wanted
to just kind of figure out what I could
do with that and I think the challenge
that a lot of people who get science
degrees run into is that they discover
that really lab work continuing
education I can't hear you people are
saying they can't hear me everyone
else's it's fine so we're going to go
with its fine lab work they go with
continuing education they get their
master's degree and or they or they go
all the way to get their PhD
then they become professors which is
basically just teacher again and I
wasn't really very good at school and
anyways okay so we're talking to right
we're talking to the guidance counselor
I'm all over the place tonight so I'm
talking to him we're talking about being
a teacher so really the only options
back then if you wanted to be like like
you know a TV star or something I mean
reality TV was was around but it was
very very limited wasn't like it is
today there's no such thing as a Kim
Kardashian there wasn't someone who was
you know like Paris Hilton were there a
socialite like that's their that's their
job description so there was no way you
know eight nine ten years ago eight
years ago I guess that anyone could have
advised me that this would exist I mean
never mind the the new setup I'm getting
which is going to allow us to do a
fairly high production value live show
on a weekly basis or more than weekly
basis or whatever we end up doing the
ability to broadcast basically almost I
mean what then would have been TV grade
quality stuff on an on a consumer
internet connection from your house with
like I mean really in the grand scheme
of things yes i just spent thirteen
thousand dollars on equipment that's
nothing compared to what that would have
cost ten years ago nothing and so so
yeah no one's been a chance i mean all
these these careers are just popping up
i was talking to my friend's dad he was
like yeah when I was a kid living on the
island you had you had a couple choices
when you graduated high school you're
gonna work in the mill for 40 years or
you were gonna work on the boats for 40
years everything is so different now
totally totally different so yeah I
think that's I think that's pretty cool
so speaking of guidance counselor's my
first topic tonight is people someone
asked I forget who requested this on
Twitter but someone asked me to do
something on Linus career tips talk
about the various careers and jobs that
are available in computers and IT now
I'm not going to talk about programming
I'm not going to talk about any of the
professional stuff because i believe the
context he was asking this in was along
the lines of what i do so i started as a
retail sales rep as a retail sales rep
you know
you can actually do okay especially if
you're knowledgeable I mean what I the
approach I always took was yeah I ups
old people I always upsell people
because I actually genuinely believe
nobody should buy a TN monitor I
genuinely believe nobody should buy a
video card for less than one hundred
dollars or like 89 99 when it's on promo
because the stuff that is under those
under those price points is not good
they're not going to be happy with it so
if you are truly enthusiastic I think
that sales is easy i think that if you
are really a car enthusiast and you love
the cars and in your free time you come
into the dealership and you drive all
the cars so that you are knowledgeable
and you're educated and you can inform
customers then you can actually do okay
I mean as a retail sales rep identity IX
actually did better than I did for my
first year after I transferred to head
office the other one is tech work tech
work is really challenging though
because there's a variety of different
things available I mean is there anyone
in the audience who is a best buy geek
squad member i'm going to wait i'm going
to wait for the leg i'm going to see if
anyone out there is a best buy geek
squad member and tell us is it tough no
no me killer killer klowns says says he
is so there's there's a couple different
kinds of they're actually there's a lot
of different ways you can do tech you
can do freelance so you can try putting
up like Flyers everywhere and getting
people to come and and bring their
computers to you for for for fixing and
you know what you can actually make a
pretty good hourly rate but it's really
hard to find clients if you go to a
bigger chain like someone like a best
buy you can end up working in the store
where you you get people bringing in
things like I mean honestly slick used
to work at Best Buy as a tech and the
stories he tells I'm just like what I
mean he one of the other texts they're
actually advised the customer i forget
the context of it but advised a customer
if he was going to if you wanted to
remove the screen on his laptop i don't
even remember why the customer wanted to
do this but if he was going to do that
he could just saw it off and then they'd
be a way to connect it and that's the
kind of that's the kind of ludicrous
stuff that goes on
and then if you're one of the mobile
guys then you're in your mobile so so
basically if you're freelance and you
can get enough clients yeah you can do
okay whereas if you join one of those
bigger chains they're going to try and
pay you an hourly rate they're going to
try and not give you a ton of commission
something like NCIX is somewhere in the
middle where you have enough clients you
do get a decent commission on everything
you do and you can make a decent living
at it but if you're not willing to teach
yourself it comes down to the same thing
as sales if you're not willing to read
an antec Tom's Hardware hard ocp
whatever sites you like whatever forums
go to Hardware canucks if you're not
willing to do it every day and help
people and learn and see what works and
see what doesn't work then you'll be a
total failure at it back up the night
from a milk okay there you go you guys
good you coo um right so so I did some
sales I did a very small amount of tech
babe they didn't want me doing tech
because I was really good at sales i was
always selling like these massive
systems that have like dual graphics
cards and stuff because I'm believed in
the stuff I was like yeah this stuff's
cool you should totally buy it so that I
can build it for you and play with it
before I give it to you I mean that was
that was the kind of guy was right so um
right so I mean you can store manager
for store manager I'd say it's a totally
different skill set because you don't
actually necessarily need to know
anything about the technology a good
manager can manage anything I believe
that's true the same way that I believe
a good salesman can sell anything
however the overlap between good sales
people like salespeople by nature and
guys who are super into technology
enthusiast guys is actually not that big
I mean correct me if I'm wrong here guys
but aren't we mostly a little bit
introverted we mostly like to to be at
home on a Friday night I mean it's
Friday night you guys are watching me so
I think we all know the answer to that
so the way to succeed I think then that
sales role or that tech role is to be
that true enthusiast whose really really
trying to learn and really trying to be
passionate I mean I never I never took a
course for computer stuff I just read
and read and read all day all night I'd
be up till who knows in the morning
reading every forum in every review so
even if I hadn't laid hands
on a current generation motherboard i
could tell you how to overclock it i
could tell you what cpus were optimized
for it i could tell you what ram works
what ram doesn't work that's the only
way you're ever going to succeed okay
moving right along people who want to do
this on the side you know I have a lot
of people whether it's posting on the
NCIX forum or whether it's messaging me
they tell me Linus I want to like build
computers for people and you know I
wanted like buy the parts at the local
store and you know get a relationship
with them so I get a good deal and then
I want to build it for someone and then
I want to make a couple bucks and I
always tell these people the same thing
and I I feel bad because it's bad news
and I don't like giving people bad news
but the reality of it is there is no
money in it I mean I don't know if you
guys know this or if you understand this
but in the IT industry on a motherboard
there's no profit so the best discount
like the best deal you're going to get
from whatever store you're working with
is probably a couple percent off and
when we're talking something that costs
$200 we're talking like five dollars
maybe ten dollars if you're really
persistent off of a sticker price okay
so then how much can you charge someone
to assemble a pc for them I mean usually
I mean NCIX charges 50 bucks and they
throw in a one-year warranty let me tell
you if you have one support issue with
that pc that 50 bucks is gone it's gone
you just have to be sure that everything
you sell is going to not come back so
yes okay so there's no money in
assembling it because you know guys like
HP or those those those those big box
guys are just you know building these
things and assembly lines like this how
you going to compete with that and then
you've got stores like an NCIX or you've
got guys like an i buy power who are
assembling the pcs with a production
system behind it so that it costs them
very little to do so there's no money
there either but the recommendation I
give to these people is if you're still
in high school and you're just looking
to like make five bucks on the side or
ten bucks here and there and you're
looking to do it as a hobby where you're
you know you're helping people you're
letting people come to you and you're
just kind of being like yeah you know
hey let me let me assemble it for you
I'll you can take a couple bucks for
consulting with them and helping them
get better value out of the system I
mean that was one of the things I always
loved doing
people would bring me these computers
and they'd be like spending two thousand
dollars and I'd look at it and I'd go
you're buying an extreme edition your
computer costs two thousand dollars that
is a terrible value you shouldn't be
buying an extreme edition unless your
computer costs five thousand dollars
otherwise the balance is completely out
of whack it's not right you need to be
spending less on your cpu and you need
to you need to amp up your graphics card
performance in order to make a more
balanced rig so I'd go I'd do a couple
things sometimes I'd get them the same
performance and I'd lower the price by a
little bit or other times I'd go look
you're spending this much money let me
help you let me get you twenty percent
thirty percent better performance and so
if you're able to do that as someone
who's doing this on the side then that's
one of the ways that you can distinguish
yourself as well again it's not going to
work without spur hard work and
researching everything you have to be
sure because one support call will cost
you anything you could have possibly
made on that transaction um oh yeah this
was this was an idea I had oh crap you
know what I'm totally gonna bail on you
guys for a second so let's um let's
let's put up like I don't know the
Twitter feed or something I'll be back
in like one moment and there's no one
behind you I do people keep asking me
this it's a window crying out loud see
it's me see the arm see the arm behind
me it's me calm down just a sec
okay so for those of you who do want to
do a little bit of tech work on the side
you know don't let me be too
discouraging because if you're doing it
for the fun then you can always do
things for fun all right so I wanted to
do a little thing called what to keep in
your tech bag and I thought I'd bring
out my own backpack yes that is a
Windows Vista backpack so just deal with
it I happen to like Windows Vista I
think it's good I think windows seven is
really not that different all right so
number one I have a tablet in my bag
tablets are handy because if you need to
be looking something up or doing
something other than the computer you're
working on you can't rely on the
computer you're working on in order to
you know give you instructions for
something I mean if you're working on a
computer for someone don't be afraid to
just google it and and get help because
no one can remember absolutely
everything so so a tablet is huge
because that way you can be referring to
that while you while you're doing
something else on the computer even if
it's rebooting or even if it has like
serious problems and it's like super
bogged down and slow ok let's go into
the other bag here what else we got in
here ok these are my shoes don't worry
about that that's that's not normally in
there I had my shoes in my bag because I
was I was riding my bike to that to that
social media conference and so I had to
wear my riding boots ok I keep a camera
in mind that's not necessarily necessary
for you however I mean something kind of
cool that that I used to do when I was
painting houses I'd always take it
before and after picture never hurts to
have a proper camera on you lots of lots
of folks you know are big into oh yeah
my phone's got like eight megapixels in
blah blah blah but the reality of it is
image quality ok image quality is about
light it's simple physics the more
surface area on the sensor and the
bigger the optics the better the image
it's not about megapixels so you can
take that to the bank all right putting
aside my camera what else we got in here
ok I always keep a couple spare
components in this case I've got more
than enough but you know I'll always
keep a stick or two of RAM you know
like a crappy video card a crappy Nick
you should always have a crappy internet
work card because you never know when
you're going to run into some stupid
issue where you're trying to download
like an anti-virus and their nick is
dead and they don't have another
computer you can't download new drivers
total total disaster you always want to
make sure that you're connected and
that's one of the things that the tablet
will help with as well so a little bit
of spare hardware maybe you don't keep
it in your backpack but keep it
somewhere close by I guess if you guys
watch my show you'll know the iconic
screwdriver always have a screwdriver
always have this in the end of my
screwdriver I keep five things I know
there are exactly five I have a slot
head okay I have a standard Robertson
this comes in handy all the time not for
computers mind you I have a really
skinny Phillips head and it's not
focusing on this but whatever you get a
point I have a really wide Phillips head
okay so more torque for for stripped
screw stuff like that and I keep a very
strong needle I keep a needle in here
because needles are useful for all kinds
of stuff whether it's you know pulling
pins out of a molex connector or whether
it's just like poking at something to
get some dust out of it you know like
maybe there's some gunk stuck in a
connector you got to get it out of there
always keep a needle on you very very
important and then of course my standard
Phillips head which is the one that I
keep loaded at all times and I get asked
a lot what screwdriver is this is a
snap-on ratcheting screwdriver cost
about a hundred bucks available in a
wide variety of colors I didn't pay a
hundred dollars for it it was a gift I
would never pay a hundred dollars for a
screwdriver because I'm totally cheap
but whatever needlenose pliers if you
don't have needle nose pliers in your
tech bag then you suck give up don't
bother anymore the same goes for where
are my where are they yeah here we go
okay cut-offs these are great for
cutting off zip ties you need to have
these you must have these if you don't
have these you suck get get them they're
cheap you can get them at the dollar
store okay this is not related this is
my battery case for my iphone that
doesn't work anymore because you know
what I'm
putting that in as a topic later I hate
micro USB micro USB is the stupidest
connector that ever existed micro USB I
hate it I'm putting that in as a topic
right now we're going talk about that
later okay what else we got in here I
always keep an extra SLI bridge because
you never know you might be working on a
high-end computer you might I have seen
defective SLI bridges cause all kinds of
weird crap ah adapters if you don't keep
adapters in your tech beg you suck
because you will never succeed if you
don't have adapters where's my DVI to
vga adapter okay apparently I suck
because I don't think I have it right
now but normally I have a DVI to vga
adapter I have mini displayport to DVI
adapter I have an hdmi to DVI adapter if
you want to get yourself the best kind
of hdmi to DVI adapter get the kind that
has the analog pin outs even though they
don't do anything because otherwise DVI
cables will not plug into it so there's
ones that don't have those analog pins
holes even though they're not connected
to anything and you physically can't
plug it in stupid it's ridiculous right
always have a set of jeweler
screwdrivers because you never know when
those are going to come in handy to get
in somewhere tight I mean even just a
standard Phillips head one just if you
have to like kind of get in somewhere
and screw something in very very very
handy I keep a 3-way SLI bridge but not
everyone not everyone's gonna run into
that all the time I encounter that more
often than most card reader always have
a card reader always always always I
have an adapter here because you never
know when one of these will come in
handy this is a single three pin to duel
three pin adapter it's great for
plugging in more fans than you otherwise
have another card reader this one does
compact flash as well those are both USB
3 card readers because a little ball
work more sli bridge is this is this is
not necessary but different lengths of
SLI bridges might come in handy this is
yet another screwdriver this one has
torques though if you do any water
cooling you might run into a need for
torques if you ever have to remove
modern video cards some of them are
using stupid Torx screws because
manufacturers apparently don't want you
removing the stock heat sinks so yeah
you should have that allen keys always
have allen keys you never know when an
allen key is going to come in handy aha
this is a good one molex to SATA power
adapter keep these on you at all times
because you never know when someone's
gonna give you a simple simple job like
install a hard drive for me you show up
at the job you're like yeah cool i'll
install a hard drive for you no big deal
and you're laughing to yourself because
you're like it's good to coit five
minutes hahahaha and then they don't
have any extra SATA connectors on their
power supply and you're like keep one of
these on you very important actually you
should probably also have a dual molex
two PCIe adapter as well that's one of
the things I don't have in here I always
keep a couple of water cooling barbs on
me because I never know when I'm gonna
be one short I always keep aha this is a
couple different things here we go okay
I always have a bunch SD cards on me but
I'm like a youtuber so that's more
relevant for me than it is for you and I
always keep a variety of USBs on me okay
so these two have mostly the same crap
this is all my benchmarking utilities
all my diagnostic utilities this one
doesn't work in USB 3 ports anymore for
some reason so this is kind of my
replacement for that one I'm in
transition right now though in
transition and never trust a USB Drive
always make sure that you have it set to
sync when you plug it into your master
computer this guy right here is cool
because it has a variety of different
windows operating systems on it just
pull them off the disk i did a guide on
this on the NCIX tech tips channel so i
keep them in folders you just pull
everything out into the folder put it
into the root you install off USB it's
really really fast if you ever have to
reformat an OS we're going to save
yourself at least half an hour if you
have a USB Drive with all the relevant
Windows OS is already in there ah this
is a specific tool you need to get
yourselves one of these this is a
motherboard standoffs screwdriver so
it's kind of looks kind of like a
jeweler's screwdriver super super handy
you want one of these okay I have a
badminton racquet grip but that might
not be relevant to everyone and I think
that pretty much right oh yes business
cards make sure you always have business
cards in your bag because if you don't
have business cards and you suck because
no one will remember you unless you like
show up in a clown hat oh yes and
remember the best kind of nerd food is
fast nerd food always carry a fork so
there that is my segment on what is in
my bag and my bag is extremely deep
beg can hold anything oh look rumbles
visiting us come here sweetheart come
here baby oh there he goes say hi
everybody say hi say hi say hi to
everyone you're not gonna say hi can you
yell at them can you show them how you
yell hey there you go sweetheart now can
you show them how you talk come here
rumble Rumble no can you talk for them
he's not gonna talk for you well he did
it once he did it once so what a good
boy say hi everyone you guys want to
know what I think is the most beautiful
thing about this cat it's the
imperfections that make them special if
you guys are watching in HD you'll be
able to see that in this I right here he
has what's kind of a weird spider web
thing going on it crosses his pupil the
vet says it's fine and it's he's fine
and it doesn't hurt him and it's a and I
you know you can remove it for
aesthetics but I think it makes him more
beautiful because he's my little man and
that maybe he'll visit with us for a
little bit all right so why don't we do
a little bit of QA for a bit i know
we're half an hour into the show and my
niece uses fake me out it's not very
effective excellent love that oh i think
i bet you guys can hear him purring he's
a see he'll grab my he'll grab my arm
here show them how you grab my hand
there you go see see them grab my hand
so cute my sweetheart okay actually you
can get down now where were we going
with that it's been 30 minutes yeah it's
been 30 minutes I know right so let's do
it yeah let's do some Q&amp;amp;A I haven't done
any Q&amp;amp;A yet so we're gonna head over to
Twitter and see if we can see if we can
chat things up a little bit here get
this zoomed in a little bit so you guys
can actually see what the hey we're
talking about no trustee video card in
my bag no I don't have a video card in
my bag although normally I would I don't
do nearly as much tech work as I used to
all right slanted pillow asks I want to
upgrade my ram 8 or 16 gig
when is 16 gigs needed there are very
few people that need 16 gigs today
gamers are not one set of those people
people who do 3d rendering people who do
video editing with after effects they
need 16 gigs so actually this Ram that's
in my backpack here is to upgrade the
rendering machine that diesel has said
that we really need more ran in so we're
going to throw 32 gigs around the
problem and see if that takes care of
everything okay moving right along Linus
gtx 590 or 680 if a 590 is cheaper I'm
personally going for a 590 but the
reason is that I already have a water
block for it if i was going to choose
between the two and they were similar in
price i would go with the 680 it is much
more power efficient and it kicks out a
lot less heat into your room so yeah
performance is going to be better on the
590 bear that in mind but heat is an
issue especially in the summer minus
your sound is worse it is not everyone
else says it's better who says that
Ethan Sol kick I'm sorry I'm sorry Ethan
but you're doing it wrong actually I
don't know it could be could be to do
with anything yeah I don't know all
right hi Linus I know you say any sound
card is better than none but is there
any sub 100 dollar value sound card
you'd recommend you know what actually
there is let's go ahead let's go to full
screen here and we're going to go NCIX
calm because that's the place I work and
we're going to search for asus xonar
this is how I shop for sound cards I put
in asus xonar and then i find the price
i want to go for and i find the one that
falls in that price and has a headphone
amp and then i buy it so let's search
for yeah there it is the dgx if you're
going to use headphones you want to dgx
if you're not going to use headphones
you want something like a d1 it doesn't
matter any asus xonar is a good sound
card so don't worry too much about it
joris what is your opinion of braided
cables sold by manufacturers for their
modular power supplies are they worth it
absolutely not they're not worth it at
all they're worth it only if you want
the aesthetic of the of the aftermarket
cables I mean that's that's pretty much
it this is a purely aesthetic thing
there is no
performance benefit to it whatsoever if
anything if I think you're talking about
those individually sleeved cables if
anything individually sleeve cables are
less effective for your airflow then
then a massively just single sleeved
single sleeved bunch because it actually
splits it up and makes the cables more
bulky so I personally like the look I'm
doubles leaving my tables so I'm not
doing every individual wire but I'm
doing every two with one sleeve and to
me it's it has a value but not to
everyone Donald all man Donald my psu
popped what are the chance my other
components got overloaded you know what
these days less likely especially guys
like gigabyte build a lot of fail safes
into their motherboards to keep surges
from spreading too far but it could have
happened the only way to know for sure
plug in a new power supply and find out
what happens if the if the magic blue
smoke gets released from your hardware
then you'll know Tim which is better for
radiators if you only have room for one
set of fans push or pull for performance
it actually doesn't make a difference
for performance it's pretty much
identical it's been tested time and time
again however I always use pull if I can
and the reason for that is if you have a
radiator here and you have fans pushing
this way the dust accumulates under the
blades of the fan on the radiator fins
it's very hard to clean especially if
you get any buildup if you're pulling
air through the radiator dust
accumulates on the fins here still but
you can easily just kind of grab it and
take a dust bunny and throw it away or
you can just blow on it and it'll all
come free so that's the reason why i use
pull that tech guy i am only answering
questions on Twitter right now however I
do keep an eye on the twitch chat so
every once in a while I do stuff Linus I
tweeted that even like the pre-show does
that mean you'll never read it ever
honestly probably not I only really do I
can only do so many questions I mean you
guys tweet a lot of stuff at me and I'm
not going to talk too much about how
much stuff you guys tweet at me because
that will waste the time that I can
spend
answering questions slick no way slicks
tweeting at me that's the real slick by
the way if you guys aren't following at
slick pc on twitter just stop stop
watching right now go follow slick pc on
twitter because he's going to be
tweeting all kinds of cool stuff he's
got some really neat pictures of a
modded cosmos to that his brothers
working on very cool stuff so he I don't
know that's just a response to someone
else so that's all right mr. DJ here is
the 7970 gigahertz edition better than a
680 no neither of them are really better
than the other especially once you
overclock both of them to the max
they're very very close to each other
7970m gtx 680 if you want 3d vision if
you want physx go with the nvidia card
if you don't if you want the better
multi-monitor experience go with the
7970 figure out I mean what's your plan
in the future what are you gonna do if
you want multi-monitor go radeon if you
don't then don't then don't all right
did you do josh Josh hey what is the
best hdmi and what do you think I think
the best HDMI is um the hdmi that is
like actually you know what I don't I'm
sorry I don't know how to answer that
question hdmi it could be nice good
actually I don't really like HDMI i'm a
big fan of evi because it carries more
bandwidth in hdmi although hdmi 1.4
whatever I think is 1.4 compliant
devices with the faster processing chip
are finally caught up to DVI I mean
DisplayPort is the way of the future
hdmi is honestly holding back things
like 4k I mean for case supported at
24fps which just sucks it's holding back
things like 3d because 3d is all like a
ghetto sort of compressed thing with
hdmi it's not truly fast enough for
really anything these days although I
did discover some really cool hdmi
cables recently check this out check
this out so you know what we're just
going to make this big here so I was on
monoprice if you guys don't know
monoprice monoprice is kind of amazing
because they have everything and it's a
it's this stuff so I need some no no
this stuff this stuff it's called
admir so I need some long hdmi cables
that are thin and red mirror allows you
to have a 28 AWG wire and up to a 60
foot cable for like 75 bucks which is
absolutely outstanding I'm super super
impressed with with that whole idea and
so i'll be using that for for my camera
as i'm like as i have someone floating
around the camera taking b-roll footage
during the unboxing i'm going to have
that long wire running without the
weight on the hdmi connection that would
cause it to break so i think that's
really cool that seems like kind of a
newer ish numerous thing so yeah I'm
super super excited about that matthew
says mini USB are slow and crappy yes
they are I hate them actually they're
not slow they're just USB but but
they're crappy I hate them they break we
suck all right I accidentally clicked
the thing I don't want to do that I want
to just scroll down scroll down a mere
what does microUSB ever done to you it
breaks and it sucks it's not as good as
many be and it's not much smaller hey
I'm saving this rant for later guys are
killing me here Adrian says is SSD of
different blends really differs a lot in
terms of durability i just bought a
hyperx 3k is it durable compared to
intel the answer would be probably not
Intel doesn't really spec out what PE
cycle chips they're using for their
drives I know on the 520's they're using
5k PE which basically means that drive
will inherently last about sixty six
percent longer than the drive you just
bought and a regular hyperx drive not
the 3k will actually last longer as well
however even with a 3k PE cycle with the
intelligence of the the wear leveling
algorithms and modern SSDs you really
don't have to worry about it that much I
mean it's by the time your SSD dies due
to the flash degrading 120 gigs will be
absolutely laughable it'll be stupid
it'll be like it'll be like sort of five
years from now or like it'll be like
five years ago being concerned about
like your your 250 gig hard drive I mean
now you can buy a 500 gig hard drive for
I mean okay less less so now because of
that flawed but for a while there you
could buy our drives for like four
30 bucks so yeah you're investing a lot
in your SST now but by the time it ever
matters it'll be totally worthless um
dich du du du du du du Oh test tester
says what was that camera test tester
should follow me with a real twitter
account and maybe i'll answer his
question actually no I'm just messing
with you it's an sx one is this is the
camera that I've been using for years
for my video blog my original one was
actually awesome and didn't have a big
fat scratch on the lens and when that
one died because I spilled chicken soup
on it I had to replace it and the sx one
is was gone and Canon didn't have a
direct replacement that was able to take
great 1080p video so I bought a used one
it came with a scratch on the lens hence
all the complaints that I get from you
guys about the autofocus there's nothing
I can do until my new camera arrives so
I'm sorry and yes some of you hate
Twitter and then I I can't answer
questions for you i'm sorry double Z I
know I know I I love you and everything
and I do want to talk to you but you're
gonna you're going to need Twitter so
yeah sx1 is new camera coming so don't
worry about it we were going to get this
taken care of all right I painted houses
yes I did paint houses i painted houses
for two summers we have student works
painting all right moving right along
moving right along moving right along oh
who wants a shout out Jerry Guan wants a
shout out hi Jerry oh my goodness is
Jerry oh sorry i was thinking of
seinfeld j1 huh no I'm just kidding gosh
shadow to Jake one okay Linus is NCIX
ever going international funny you
should ask because NCIX is already in
the US which is sort of international to
Canada as for what's going on with any
kind of future expansion honestly I'm
like the YouTube guy I'm a product
manager on the category manager so I'm
not exactly like you know like p on
level here like why I used to be a
retail sales guy but I still can't
comment on that kind of stuff once the
next personal break update honestly
here's the problem right now I'm working
on drumming i get home at around the
baby's bedtime every day which means
this
i turn on ad revel at 35 thousand RPM in
my garage my wife will kill me she will
absolutely destroy me so this weekend
I'm hoping to find some time while he's
awake to dremel out the cpu cut out and
then i'll be able to actually post post
an update so i'm super excited about
that I Gabriel says does NCIX ship
custom computers to the US the answer is
yes but not really you have to jump
through some hoops email pc that is pc
at NCI x.com and the crazy russian or
brian the gamer will take care of you
and they will they will get that sorted
out for you okay they will they'll make
sure that you can buy a pc all right
juan solo home solo that's awesome that
is just awesome fun solo oh man do you
think college university is necessary
for a job in IT i would say it's not
necessary i'd say it's highly
recommended i do not have a university
or a college degree i'm doing alright
but i have busted my tail it's not as
easy or maybe it is i don't know i mean
i never tried the other way so it
depends what you want to do I mean you
want to be a programmer um you should
probably get some education unless
you're really good at being self
educated if you want to be like a
technician or whatever else no totally
not necessary but it really depends what
you're talking about i mean do you want
to be a motherboard engineer then like
yeah then you're gonna need school so
it's a very vague question I'm sorry WAN
I just I saw your name and I was like oh
my goodness he's gonna ask me about
smuggling or like he's gonna tell me
about smuggling and I was going to be
like amazed I was going to talk about
like the Kessel run I'm now I'm
disappointed
alright let's see if we got any more
questions Michael wants to know what
sort of music are you into you know what
just for lulz let's have a look at
what's in my music library all right so
I'm gonna I'm going to pull this over
here we are totally going to just go to
my music folder we are not even going to
censor any of this stuff so let's go I
actually sort my music according to
folder still I am I'm actually that
demented so let's go with let's go with
medium icons so you guys can actually
see what we're dealing with here so
we've got some oh yeah we've got some
terrible 90s like trance stuff we've got
some ABBA alright we've got adam gregory
who was like a one hit wonder got some
ace of base what other terrible stuff do
we have any rylann is-- Morissette
Alanis Morissette is a Canadian hero yes
I have one justin bieber song in here
what else we got we got some bare naked
ladies barenaked ladies is good stuff
Canadians Canadians all I've got some
Backstreet Boys in here so my music
collection is probably one of the most
eclectic music collections you will ever
encounter I listen to almost everything
got some Chumbawamba some a little bit
of cold place and Carrie Underwood okay
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna make you
guys
yeah yep so uh so yeah that's uh that's
that's that's all done now don't worry
we're not gonna I'm not going to do this
to you anymore so basically you made the
mistake of asking me what kind of music
I listened to and I made you suffer so I
think what you discovered is that you no
longer want to know haha okay and no
don't-don't-don't unsub because of my
music taste come on guys come on I'm
sorry I didn't know that that was really
loud I'm really sorry I'm really sorry I
I haven't tested that feature before
however however I want you guys to oh no
no I want you guys to note this okay so
we're going to search for some kind of
some kind of Linus video on youtube hold
on you switch my view here so we're
gonna search for like Linus Linus I
don't know something back there that's a
good keyword I should bring up something
all right let's go with this video the
one where I like Hulk lift this case so
check this out check this out have you
ever had deja deja and I want you guys
to tell me if the sound of shell flew
the headphone jack is going is it
working yeah sound and staff so the
scallop is more along the with a rubber
coating on the outside it actually yes
you can easily carry it around like this
ashley is here the whole stronger than
me it's not quite like the like the
Hammers on the cosmos to to have those
those beautiful I thought I have a bar
running down the both side of my top of
it but I mean this is another there's a
minute and it has a rubberized promoting
impressed by that makes it you go this
is the handle is a really handy thing
has a half for your face because if
you're unboxing it you might find had
there we go had the case actually been
full of a system I would not at all have
been able to do that so it's only
because the case is pretty light and I
and it was empty that I was able to do
that I was able to do anything like that
so here Alyssa let's bring me back let's
bring me back no I do not lift weights
the only exercise that I have done in
the last sort of two to three years is
playing badminton so what you guys will
notice is that here I'll see if I can
show this to my right arm right here
is significantly wider especially here
in the forearm sale flex them both then
my left arm and that's not for the
reason you think it is that's because of
badminton and actually now I now I'm
swimming so I've been if you guys are
subscribed to my Twitter following me on
twitter i always forget the terminology
if you're following me on twitter then
you know that I've been swimming in the
mornings about three times a week and
I'm trying to get some endurance back
some cardio so it's sigh it's tough I
mean it's hard when you have a desk job
because you just it's so easy to be
totally sedentary and not do anything
but yeah it's it's important it's really
important Pascal says hi worked at
future shop as a sales rep awful job I'm
sorry to hear that man I actually apply
yet oh oh wow funny story okay we're
gonna go off on a tangent here future
shop so I applied to future shop when I
was about I don't know 16 this is before
i was working at NCIX before I'd ever
really had a real job and they had an
online job in job interview like an
online application that you fill out and
it's got all those it's got those
questions its cost questions like um you
know if you saw fellow employee
shoplifting something trivial like
something small like five bucks or
something and they were a close friend
of yours would you a say nothing be talk
to them quietly and asked them to put it
back where she report it to a supervisor
and I answered honestly I would do be I
wouldn't take it straight to the
supervisor I talked to them for us to be
like hey man that's not cool and so what
I reeled what I did is I answered the
survey honestly as opposed to filling in
the obvious answer that they wanted to
hear and without even taking long enough
for anyone to review my application it
rejected it and so what I realize and it
was totally unrealistic stuff like you'd
have to be some kind of like like
unbelievable like straight arrow to to
actually answer all these questions the
way they wanted to hear it and so what I
realized is that future shop's hiring
policy at that time prevented anyone
honest from actually working there like
if you were if you were honest
filling out the survey then they
wouldn't hire you period you had to you
had to be like willing to lie at the
right time so um yeah I never really did
it not only did it reject my application
but they told me I couldn't reapply for
like three or six months or something
like that I was like six months i'm 16
man that's gonna be forever from now so
ideas I never ended up getting going
there I mean hey who knows things could
have been totally different what if this
was futureshop tech tips I mean we were
we were like this close to this being
futureshop tech tips and and it would be
about like monster cables no I would
never do that don't worry you guys I
know better than that ok Lewis asks me
if you were to choose another job in the
tech industry what would it be you know
what I've actually thought about this
because I like my job I love my job but
it's super stressful i work super hard i
work long hours if i was gonna choose
another job i would be a technician
again i would assemble pcs again because
I actually still enjoy it and it's just
not stressful and um yeah now it's
probably what I would do I mean other
than that I think I have the best job in
the world I I get to be a product
manager I get to boss around the Russian
all day and and I get to make videos for
you guys which is which is great it's
fun so let's go ahead and move down a
Pascal says yes I am tech in small clump
shop and yes he's harmed I'm just
assuming that you know oh no oh no he's
probably French ok let's see if I can
pull out a French accent you know I
probably can't do it forget it I'm not
going to try ah Joshua says what do you
think about opera um I can't really sing
it but I I mean I guess if it was
playing like I was in a casino or
something and it was just kind of
playing like I wouldn't leave because of
it and I know that you mean the browser
I believe it or not I have opera on my
computer I very rarely use it the only
reason I have five browsers is so that I
can keep track of sort of five different
sets of logins that are in all of them
so it's just very convenient that way
okay moving right along then Linus
please answer how does overclocking
affect product lifetime I would
postulate that unless
you're going really extreme and you're
like trying to break stuff so if you're
staying reasonable you're staying within
sort of the communities generally
accepted guidelines for how much voltage
you should push through how much heat
you should be outputting how high you
should go probably not enough that it
matters however i have had two cpu die
out right and overclocked cpu i have had
cpus be great on me to the point where
they wouldn't overclock as high as they
used to but it's never really been
relevant for me I mean I've always been
I've always been changing my hardware
before it ever mattered so I just sell
it and then I just say yeah it
overclocks to this much and your mileage
may vary and then I don't worry too much
about it I put Twitter up please sorry
guys totally forgot about that there you
go how can I wear the 7h I have one it's
literally put a dent in my head it's so
heavy ah no way Shane I love the 7 h-7
teaches awesome it's lighter than the
Vulcan it sounds better than anything
else out there like by a long shot nope
nope I love the seven h70 Ted's buy one
today product placement for steel she
actually no I mean they did give me this
headset I did not pay for this headset
but I do love it it's my favorite I got
rid of my HD 555 from sennheiser that i
did pay for in exchange for these i had
to pull these off of my personal rig
upstairs in order to wear them for this
live stream okay doo doo doo doo doo ya
see this kind of stuff Mike you got it
you got it bang on here the speed that
life changes over 9000 come to thinking
that I'm watching a person over a
thousand miles away talk at me live and
I'm gonna add to that from his kitchen
with technology that would have cost
tens maybe hundreds of thousands of
dollars 10 years ago 20 years ago all
right you know what let's go ahead and
let's catch up with some of the new oh
my goodness 395 new interactions okay
you know what we're not going to touch
Twitter for a little bit I i love that
you guys are are adding me on twitter
and that you're tweeting at me and this
is all really good stuff but i can only
do so much so we're going to move on to
our next topic of the night which is
used hard drives i thought this was a
really really good question from whoever
i forget but he tweeted at me and this
is earlier if you tweet at me not during
a live stream the odds of getting
through to me or
be a lot better chatroom shoutouts says
ghost the capitalist ghost the
capitalist shout out to you yay yay
right so used hard drives use hard
drives are an interesting one so there's
a couple things number one is that hard
drives generally fail within the first
like 30 days or after the first couple
years that's pretty much how it goes so
if they're gonna die they'll die right
away or they'll wait a good while and
then they'll start to drop off gradually
so used hard drives generally speaking
if I was going to buy a used hard drive
I've look at a couple of different
things i look and who am i buying this
from how much have they been using it is
that has this been sitting in an ass and
has barely been used it hasn't been
moved around hasn't been jostled it
hasn't been bumped had how old is it how
old is it you can always known the
manufacturing date of a hard drive just
by looking at the sticker on the top of
it they all say number three is it still
under warranty because if you're buying
a used hard drive that's not still under
warranty that means at least a year old
okay what have they been using it for
why are they getting rid of it he said
that his work or his boss or something
like that buys a lot of use hard drives
and doesn't really worry about it and my
approach there is I've used lots of used
hard drives and refurb hard drives in my
windows home server v1 if you're doing
regular and I mean regular frequent very
frequent backups then I actually don't
inherently have a problem with using
something like you used hard drive if
your if it's got it oh yeah it's got to
be shipped carefully that's another huge
factor with hard drives you don't ship a
hard drive carefully dead hard drive but
yeah if it's been shipped carefully or
you're picking it up if it hasn't been
used that heavily if it still has
warranty I think it's probably fine I
wouldn't buy a used hard drive as
readily as I would buy something like it
used CPU or any passive component so a
motherboard with no active cooling where
you know that there's not much to wear
out other than the PWM I would shy away
from things like use power supplies
video cards are a tough one because if
they've over volta the heck out of it
and if the fans worn out yeah it can it
can go but some some guys like EVGA this
is
they're big advantages I know I talk a
lot about the big three but EVGA is a
big deal for video cards so they have a
global warranty that is tied to the
serial number not to the owner so that's
a really good one if you're going to buy
a video card yeah make sure is the
warranty transferable so some guys like
hard drives they don't care who bought
it and not going to ask you for an
invoice where are some things like most
video cards like motherboards sometimes
are going to actually ask you to produce
an original invoice and if you can it's
not going to be under warranty so that's
something to consider any time you're
buying something used alright so let's
talk about why i hate micro USB and why
it's the worst connection that ever
existed this connection is better than
micro USB because it doesn't break so
what's the key difference between my
iphone 4 and my wife samsung galaxy s
this is the version 1 vibrant my
connector still works every time when I
want to charge my phone or back it up or
pull data off of it hers does not
because micro USB is a big fat piece of
crap because if you at any point let's
see if I have a micro USB cable here
it's so stupid i hate it if at any point
you accidentally you know wiggle a micro
USB cable the pins are so small and
they're so close together that it is
incredibly easy for them to break off
the piece in the middle of the actual
female end that that makes contact with
the pins are bend it so it won't make
contact anymore it is so easy to break
it off it is so easy to its oh it's just
fragile and the thing that kills me most
about it is that compared to mini-b
remember mini be the one that used to be
on every camera ever and kind of still
on every camera but used to be for just
everything siii mini be how much bigger
then micro USB is that like how much
bigger is it this is this is a hundred
times better this is a hundred times
more robust I mean I hate mini HDMI too
I especially hate micro HDMI but no
actually I think mini HDMI is the worst
i hate fragile connectors so I don't
have anything against I don't have
anything against micro USB in particular
but I hate fragile connectors in fact I
hate hdmi to compared to DVI compared to
displayport these are locking
connectors every connector should lock
every connector should be durable I I
really just I mean come on my my grandpa
has has a blackberry playbook that he
bought a while ago and you can make all
the jokes you want about how it was
useless the day he got it but it's
useless now because he can no longer
charge it and it's like just over a year
old just stupid just just horrible many
be is not fragile ghost the capitalist
well it's fragile but it's not nearly as
fragile as micro I keen pro asks what
phone do I have I'm gonna let the rest
of you in the chat to that forum because
I think most of you probably know let's
go and do some more Twitter questions
there we go ok 44 hundred and something
new updates oh yeah okay do-do Peter
great question Peter why do you like the
TJ 07 more than the TJ 11 couple reasons
Peter number one the TJ 11 is really
date it's really big it's heavier than
the TJ 07 although it's really light for
such a big case because if it's all
aluminum construction number two is
it'll look kind of empty I'm not
planning to use an XL ATX motherboard so
it'll just have like that emptiness
factor I don't like that I prefer to I
prefer to have a bill that's all goes
together I'm on an ATX board I want to
ATX case I want an ATX power supply I
mean to me it's like using an SFX power
supply and putting it in like a mid
tower case and using like an adapter is
just gonna look stupid I saw one guy
installed an ITX board in his corsair
800d I mean that's an extreme example
but it's like the most ridiculous thing
ever I like the plainness of the TJ of
seven the T jail 11 i originally hated
it when i first saw the pictures because
i thought the front was plastic i
thought it was like plastic and cheap
the whole thing is metal it's a
beautiful case it is amazingly well
constructed but i liked the plainness i
like the flat front on the 207 I like
the flat top I just like that I like the
plane this I like the sleekness also my
TJ 07 is a gift for my wife my wife
bought it for me it was one of the first
major purchases that she made for me for
my birthday
and it was also one of the first things
I bought when I first started in CI XO
is a long time ago now so I'm pretty
attached to the to the TJ 07 I also my
TJ 07 is is baller because it's one of
the old ones new tayo tayo sevens the
unibody curve that's so smooth on mine
is actually a little bit sort of islets
well I mean what would we call it we
call it like it's not quite a perfectly
smooth curve it's got some sort of lines
to it and the reason is that the new
manufacturing process they take the
sheet they score it a couple times and
then they bend it whereas they used to
just bend the solid sheet of aluminum so
I have like the older baller TJ 07 and I
feel exclusive about it so so that's
that's another reason how much can i
benchpress not a whole lot let me tell
you that because my left arm is a week
as crap I can only do about i think i
can do about thirty five push-ups in one
go and i only weigh like 140 pounds so
that should give you some idea like the
IDF really can't really can't do it
obsidian Matthew Linus are you thinking
of getting the iphone 5 believe it or
not i'm not really a phone guy i
actually had a flip phone until work
issued me a blackberry and it was one of
those blackberries with like you know
the wheel on the side and like the
screen and like the keyboard under it
and it's like an 8300 or something like
that and I used that until work issued
me and iphone 4 I don't I don't I don't
buy phones I'm not a phone guy I'm uh I
think that any computer that's smaller
than the torso of a grown man is
probably not not that great although
phones are getting phones are getting
better phones are getting cool and all
of that but I just I know I have to get
into phones more I mean I I like
learning about new operating systems
like Android and iOS it's been it's been
eye-opening I use my phone more than I
ever thought I would but i'm still not
super like I'm not my foaming at the
mouth waiting for the awkwardness an
actual iphone bar so next android phone
I'm just I'm not that I'm far more
excited about a new flagship video card
for example okay
let's move right along sue Dion says how
many satellites are currently in orbit
sue Dion I'm going to show you a really
cool site and I know you're just
trolling me I totally know you're just
trolling me but it's called let me
google that for you and I I would use it
but I think you get the point sue Rumble
muffin says there are rumors going
around that a sous is making offers to
buy asrock how do you think this will
impact the motherboard market I don't
know if you know this but asrock
originally split off from isus I believe
they're still both owned by pegatron but
I could be wrong I don't remember
exactly the ant the what was going on
but those companies are their separate
but they're like like they're separate
they're here but they're like there's
nurse connections between those
companies so I wouldn't think I wouldn't
overthink it too much mm-hmm gabriel
says linus i posted a regular while ago
can you look at it and give me the line
of seal of approval you know what
Gabriel I am pretty busy I have a hard
time looking at every system that people
send to me especially because at least
seventy-five percent of the people that
I advise about their systems end up
arguing with me about why they chose
what they chose or didn't choose what
they choose you know I don't care
because I looked at your system I told
you how you're going to get twenty
percent more performance for five
percent more money or whatever else and
I just don't have time to debate it but
what you can do is you can email pc at
NCI XCOM and the russian or brian will
totally look at that for you and they
are as as good at configuring pcs as me
if not better so don't worry too much
about that they will they will get you
taken care of like no problem Jacob yes
at some point I will do the hackintosh I
am still waiting for a sous to send me a
PhD 77 dash I or whatever their z77 ITX
board is I don't have one yet as soon as
i have it i will get to work on that I
promise don't lag George leska rock
says- okay reflex says you know ASL I do
my mother is my mother's hard-of-hearing
she's a teacher of the deaf I had a
foster brother growing up so I'm really
rusty I used to be pretty conversent
whereas these days it's pretty tough for
me I mean it's kind of like French where
I used to be able to communicate in
French but now I mean yeah it'sit's it's
pretty tough I'm kind of an English
English speaking only guy these days I
mean I can still I can still fingerspell
you know I like I know my name sign just
like hockey with an ill sort of cheese
ball but um that's pretty much all I got
at this point Nicholas cloutier says
Linus you started as a salesman how did
you end up in the head office instead of
store management well actually it's
funny story because I went and talked to
the president of the company because I
had a really awkward conversation that I
had to have with him because I just
started at NCIX and I was like I had
this contract where I have to paint
houses this summer can you give me the
summer off can you hold a job here for
me while I will I do this and I think
that that's part of what made him that's
part of what got me his attention was
that I came in to talk to him about this
I think he looked at my numbers and what
he liked about what I was selling was I
was always selling systems I was selling
more systems than any other sales guy in
the company I was working like three
days a week and I was always selling
these high-end systems because I'm
really passionate about it and so he
said to me look not only am I going to
hold you a job here but I am going to
have you come and work at head office
when you come back and so I started out
configuring the pcs on the website and
from there I moved into product
management with water cooling and then
from there I moved into more important
product management and now I'm a
category manager and then I started
doing video somewhere along the line and
that's uh that's pretty much how it went
so there was a lot of there was a lot of
luck involved I mean it wasn't like it
wasn't like you know oh I you know um I
found like a magical sort of toothpick
and then I fought the mighty pint sized
reagan and i slayed him and I you know
stabbed him in the foot and it turned
out that that was where his heart was I
was like oh I conquered the Beast and
then I put him in this jar
and like it wasn't anything like that it
was uh there was some luck involved i
think i think with success there's
always a little bit of a little bit of
luck involved LD form says wish me
goodnight your stream keeps me up it's
1am I am NOT going to wish you good
night because you should stick around
and watch the rest of the stream it's
only 25 more minutes and it's fun right
are we having fun this is a good stream
you guys enjoying it you guys cool all
right good and oh there's no cookies in
it it's actually oh that's disgusting
it's really oh look at this it's really
old I had no idea I thought it was flour
it's old ketchup packets from McDonald's
and like old sweet and sour packets see
look at that that one have some sauce on
the top right there dare me to lick it
should I look it come on I need to see
what you guys say should I like it Oh
disgusting okay oh I can still taste it
ah ah awful ah ah I've got spit all over
my chin because I pressed it so hard
against my tongue that it matched my
tongue on my Chin's disgusting it's
disgusting I don't don't do that okay
moving right along mark wants to know
will we be doing multicam in the future
yes we will linus i have a copy of
windows 8 from university i'm on the
offense about upgrading i'm planning to
upgrade i think that the only way to
move is forward so i'm going to try it
and I'm gonna make make myself like it
because it's not going away Linus are
you going to upgrade your 9268 I and
your rig to the new successor I'm not
planning to do that adaptec has a really
cool new card coming that I'm pretty
excited about and my 9260 is honestly
fast enough for me it's good enough for
about 2 gigabytes per second reads which
is I mean I've only got se22 SSDs on
there now I could still get more
performance out of that card just by
upgrading the SSDs instead so imma stick
with that stick with that card for now i
really like it's reliable I've got a
I've got like a special custom heatsink
I made for the battery so that doesn't
overheat so everything's just kind of
working the way I like it Joe wants to
know if it's possible the liquid cool
and overclocked and SSD
let me tell you Joe that is the most
fantastic Twitter profile picture that I
think I have ever seen look at this look
at this burger look at this guy I mean
the burger so big it makes this huge
black guy look small that is that is
fantastic Joe is that you tell me Joe if
that is you I need to know you have to
tweet you have to tweet me later or
something because that is just fantastic
that burger is amazing so back to back
back to twitter i guess i guess we're up
at the top now or maybe we're not i
don't know what's going on go back to
connect there we go let's get connected
with each other yo not like in a weird
way it's in like a good way Mike
Canadians go to mcdonalds also Linus did
you hear about New York City banning the
sale of big gulp size drinks you know
what this isn't something I was planning
to talk about tonight but huge soft
drinks are going to kill you I I know
that I don't have a channel called Linus
health tips and I'm not necessarily the
most healthy guy in the world but I was
uh we were at the nurses place we were
getting immunizations for the baby and I
was I was sort of marveling at I mean
I'm a huge ice tea guy I love iced tea
it's just the best thing ever and if you
guys don't live in Canada if you live in
the u.s. what you don't know is that in
oh come on Linus racist I said he's a
black guy I'm a white guy it's not
racist cheese I didn't say it was fat I
said he was big he is big anyway so we
were at the we're at the nurses who
nurses office to get some immunizations
for the baby and they had a chart on the
wall showing like how much sugar is in
crap and it reminded me at this time
that I was down in the US and I ordered
iced tea I'd never really gone to the
states and I've never really gone to a
restaurant there before and I ordered an
iced tea at red robin I took one sip of
it and I just about spit it all over the
table because I realized it wasn't
sweetened and what I realized about
about that okay first of all sugar sugar
will kill you because it turns into fat
okay so there's that and then second of
all is i remember how much sugar i ended
up putting from the table they had like
sugar packets i remember how
sugar I ended up putting into the ice
tea to make it even remotely palatable
and being absolutely disgusted at how
much sugar I was putting in the string
because you don't think about it when
it's mixed into something but pop ice
tea that stuff will kill you the best
thing to drink right there water so I'm
almost drink only water the times I
drink iced tea I drink iced tea when I
go to a restaurant I treat myself but I
try not to keep it in the house because
that stuff will kill me and I try to
realize that performance studios what
editor do you use to edit your videos i
personally use sony vegas movie studio
because i'm cheap and i don't know how
to use anything else um what's his name
diesel brought brought his copy of cs6
that he's been using to help us and yeah
it's pretty coo based on what he's been
doing lately I mean I'm not okay okay
you know what we're gonna we're gonna go
we're gonna go on a YouTube adventure
here guys and i'm going to show you the
latest edition of net linked weekly
which is actually amazing and i'm like
super happy with it i didn't i didn't
ask him to do this at all but he just
did a fantastic job of the editing on
this one so we had a street fighter
showdown between me and Tom the artist
and he added like the coolest effect
that I that I totally I mean I tell them
be creative about this stuff you know
have fun but I didn't think he'd be this
creative and I didn't think he'd have
this much fun i was i was super super
impressed with this i'm going to turn on
the sound I'm gonna stop talking for a
minute here it's pretty even for me and
Tom and here we go so I really I don't
even know what button kicks guys like
that okay like you guys like those heads
and health bars down there does that
even work oh no I I did damage okay
don't do that he knows combos and stuff
that's not fair I don't know comedy it's
not a doing Duke it don't know the
office knows if I just kicked my long
story i'm alone i figure out how to turn
the audio off here yeah long story short
I kicked Tom's but in spite of the fact
that that was his copy of street fighter
4 i've played street fighter for a grand
total of about like one hour before in
my life when i sat down and kind of
played it for a bit i have never once
played a game on a Playstation 3 before
that i'm totally not a console guy but I
yeah yeah I i I'm I did myself proud I
did myself proud
in that Street Fighter match there so I
don't remember how we got on this topic
but let's go ahead and move right along
here okay moving on down moving on down
moving on down what's your favorite case
TJ 07 dan says I have to wake up at 7am
tomorrow for school that sucks dan I
remember school getting up early sucks
but like stay in school it's important
and stuff okay let's see let's view this
conversation I don't know where this
came from oh I think so i think i'm
getting i think i'm getting burned for
not thinking that girl gamers exist I
found this I found this evidently girl
gamer oh no that that is though that is
the one she did reply to my tweet here
oh yeah okay so we are oh I just saw
this tweet during my livestream my
audience says hi you guys say hi right
you guys say hi to the girl gamer who
did an unboxing of a video card I was
like ooh amateur unboxings very cool
well someone apparently knows who this
is I've never heard of her room before
but people don't say people don't say hi
well you know what too bad I'm saying hi
on behalf of you guys because I'll just
force you to be somewhat polite how do I
turn this off close this go away and go
away no no no okay you know it's to
scroll down there we go all right how
long till a replacement for ddr3
actually they've just finalized the ddr4
spec however I don't think it matters
that much I don't know if you guys
remember this but the upgrade and
performance going from ddr2 to ddr3 was
very very miniscule as soon as we move
to an integrated memory controller on
most of the modern see well every modern
CPU on the desktop from AMD and Intel it
stopped really matter what the speed of
the memory is because the latency goes
up as we increase the frequency and we
just don't need more bandwidth on the
desktop I mean if you guys need any
evidence of this go and look at some of
the write-ups that have been done about
LGA 2011 where they take the head they
actually run every four to one two three
and four channels of memory
platform because it's fully capable of
running in dual channel and what's
discovered a lot of the time is that
dual channel is just as good as quad
channel in some cases where Layton sees
more important and quad channels better
where you need more bandwidth but these
are very very small margins of victory
on both sides the only time you really
run into trouble is when you're running
single channel so yeah there you go I I
mean it's coming but I don't know how
relevant it is Peter wants to know what
is the story behind camera man's apple
prowess also it seems slick and diesel
don't mind being on camera anymore so
cameraman is an apple guy cameraman is
the one who convinced me to get an
iphone 4 cameraman edits all those
videos on a mac back in the day when
when we were doing like old-school tech
tips you know what let's pull up let's
pull up some old-school tech tips for
you guys so here we're going to go to
let's let's let's change our view here
let's do this let's go to youtube.com
slash NCIX calm okay I'm gonna pull out
some classic classic stuff here guys
you're gonna what you're gonna love this
are you gonna hate it you know what get
over it um so oldest to newest here we
go here we go okay so first of all
there's that NCIX commercial that I had
nothing to do with um where's where's
the where's that one there's a
particular one I'm looking for here guys
cameramen did all these like awesome
awesome like cheese ball effects this is
right around the time we got our new
studio okay so you got you guys are
going to watch the movement you guys are
going to watch this with me along i'm
going to switch this to fullscreen i'm
going to put that on oh yeah 720p like
it's i don't know whatever year that was
a long time ago hi welcome to NCIX tech
tips today we'll be covering a very
special new platform launched from AMD
so it's called the dragon platform and
it features the Phantom to process your
that bottom tier here we're gonna put on
our investigation cats to open it up and
see what's inside and whoa okay okay
hold on hold on let me let me get this
quote see how fun is that camera man did
all of that on a Mac so so Apple can't
be Apple can't be all bad right am i
right I'm not right
you know cameraman would have us believe
that I'm right so let's go ahead and
keep moving down here dudududu scrolling
down looking at some questions john
wants to know how hard do you think it
is to run a business solely on custom
systems how would I do it John it's
probably not doable there's two guys in
the u.s. doing it right now high power
and cyberpower they are both basically
it's saturated there's no room for
really anyone else to make a real living
to have like a significant company I
mean okay there's smaller guys like
falken or you know whatever whatever
those guys but these are this is a very
niche niche market and the reason that
people buy from them is there a long
time trusted brand they've been around
forever as a new startup it would be i'm
going to say impossible it's not a
business that i would start brian says I
may be a little off topic here
absolutely not Ryan questions about
power supplies are 100 and well just one
hundred percent people who say more than
one hundred percent tick me off because
there's no such thing unless we're
talking about growth so Linus I may be a
little off topic here but my corsair
tx750 be two died on me and I'm gonna
buy a seasonic platinum 860 what do you
think I think that's a fantastic idea
seasonic our supplies are the shizzle
david says did that guy from last week
who you offered to build his pc for a
thousand dollars ever respond he did
respond he seemed like he was going to
do it but I talked him out of it because
it makes no sense to give someone a
thousand dollars to assemble a PC for
you all right right along would you say
a sound card is necessary for games like
bf3 a sound card is necessary for life
you should have a sound card because it
makes everything sound better oh this is
the this is the saddest thing that I've
that I've seen today KPK tds has Linus
you are loved by thousands thank you I'm
completely alone what do you recommend
me first of all let's find out how alone
he is hold on oh my goodness he is
actually completely alone he has zero
fall
lawyers you know what I would like you
guys to do just one of you just one of
you I would like one of you to follow
KPK tds on Twitter please can someone do
that someone follow him come on I'm not
and we're not moving on with the live
stream until someone does it okay so I'm
gonna refresh this page and if no one's
following him then then we're not yeah
we're not moving on here 0followers
still guys this isn't good enough let's
go let's go kpk tds let's go 0followers
still we're not I'm serious I'm serious
someone do it just one he's not going to
be alone no I'm not going to follow him
I don't follow people on Twitter my egos
way too big I'm trying to refresh here
I'm pressed f5 what do you want here a
hundred followers there we go KPK tds
you have a hundred followers on twitter
you have people to talk to I don't know
if they're going to pay attention or not
but I hope they will because I think
that the people who are tuned into the
livestream the people who watch tech
tips on YouTube are generally a cut
above the rest of the internet garbage
and the what I base this on is the
quality of the comments on my videos the
quality of the chat that we have going
on here the quality of the conversations
it's good stuff and they're good people
so now they are going to talk to you or
they might not and let's move right
along okay Charlie what do I think of
the TJ 07 based murder box I love it I
think it's expensive I think if you want
as good a case as you can pretty much
get Charles is the man he's been hehe
started up in Vancouver I actually I
saved his butt once on one of his first
murder boxes he had a bill that he had
to get done g three eighths fittings
were really hard to come by and i had a
beautiful pair of them I don't remember
where I got them but we had none in
stock at NCIX there was nothing local he
couldn't find anything and he called me
up he said Linus do you have any g three
eighths finish I have to finish this
system if I don't finish the system it's
going to be a big problem for me it's
gonna be weeks to get more g three
eighths fittings and he does not believe
in using anything but the best so he was
using a thermal chilled rad no questions
they were not jeewan quarterback in
those days so I said look Charles dude
all I've got is these ones I'm saving
these from I build these are the nicest
d three eighths fittings I've ever
encountered I've never seen any like
them ever again glad I was like look
dude for you they're yours didn't charge
him for him just gave them to him and
that's that's really the only story i
have about Charles but either way I like
him I liked him him there that's the
point I liked him enough to give up
special fittings and I'm I'm totally
totally totally OCD about things like
water cooling fittings if I have like
the perfect I mean fittings all sucked
back in those days we didn't have
bitspower so yeah I like Charles he's a
good guy mm-hmm moving further down the
down Murray says how do I feel about the
aesthetics of the switch 810 and what do
I think about the features includes for
the price I think it's very plastic I'm
not much of a plastic guy so there you
go and I saw someone asking in the chat
about red versus brown switches you know
what I'm not a big red guy I love the
k90 from corsair i love the backlight i
love the awesome aluminum base plate I
do not love the red switches and that's
really really preventing me from using
that keyboard so i would go browns over
i'd go anything over reds pretty much
steve wants to know what i think of as
rocks xfast ren xfast land and X fast
USB well X fast USB is pretty
straightforward because i think it just
means USB 3 as for their ex fast ram the
next fast LAN yeah um camargo says go to
justin.tv instead admins on twitchtv are
pretty abusive well you know what I know
a couple of admin's over here in fact
there was one watching at the start let
me have a look if he's still here oh no
there's old there's a different staff
sin win are only that is let's see if he
is abusive I'm gonna I'm gonna totally
like say something mean about it I'm
gonna say like sin win sin wins dog has
Tourette's BAM
oh it's John oh whatever whatever John
no one cares what you think anyway gone
let's see you get abusive band I'll band
you I'm trying ban him I tried this once
with fuzzy uh-oh I can't even do it yeah
no it's cuz I'm not logged in yeah yeah
BAM anyway okay moving right along so
twitch seems to want me on there so I'm
not gonna I'm not gonna I'm not going to
defy them by moving over to justin.tv
because I think they could follow me
over there and tell me to come back to
twitch based on that they're somewhat
affiliated queen bugle says how about a
TJ 07 unboxing great suggestion
unfortunately I I mean I've talked about
the TJ 07 a lot I don't really have any
handy to unbox so there's not a whole
lot I can do about that but but yeah but
yeah no good idea though good idea way
McHale no I have lights I don't have any
of those other bands but i do have
lights in my music collection okay you
know what I have another requested topic
for tonight and this is totally going to
be boring for most of you so you can
tune out if you want but someone asked
me to talk about my bike gear so I will
be back in like one minute I'm just
going to go grab my bike gear and we're
going to talk about we're going to talk
about motorcycle safety so I'll be back
in like two seconds I have a pretty
sweet helmet though so you guys should
definitely stick around and check it out
alright so if any of you guys are riders
out there then you've probably heard the
phrase all the gear all the time I
firmly believe that if you're thinking
about riding a motorcycle or if you're
riding a motorcycle now and you're not
doing this already that you need to make
sure part of your budget for learning to
ride make sure you get a course unless
you have a super experienced rider to to
train you and show you what to do and
yeah basically yeah make sure you get a
course and make sure you allocate money
for gear so this is my RF 1100 is my
sweet-ass helmet your helmet should be
the first thing you buy yes helmets are
not that useful beyond about 60 70
kilometers an hour even 50 but if you
get into a pickle and you hit your head
your intellect is for your most valuable
possession you don't want to mess that
up so I actually did an unboxing video
of this helmet way back when I got it so
let's go ahead and let's check that out
here I bet there's not that many like
shoei helmet unboxings on youtube would
there be shoei helmet here they're
fairly helmet unboxing look at that hit
number one like a boss so here's me
unboxing my helmet when I was like super
excited I've never ridden a motorcycle
yet I got all my gear from back then it
was called new enough calm but now it's
called motorcycle gear calm pretty
awesome so here I am like super excited
about my helmet so that's the same
helmet I just showed you see see it
looks the same helmets are only good for
about five years and rule number one of
helmets never ever whack them on
anything always put them down on the
ground where they'll be safe and they
won't fall because as soon as your
helmet falls and damages the protective
material inside it's totally useless
okay so boots people underestimate the
importance of boots paid a couple
hundred bucks for these they're
rainproof in theory nothing's rainproof
when it comes to motorcycle gear
something I discovered they have
reflectors on the back totally useless
because my pants cover them anyway but
what
do like about these is they're extremely
ruggedly built very very thick on the
top so that you don't have any
discomfort when you're shifting and they
have extra padding extra armor built
into things like the ankles so these
things are important I was trying to
explain to my mom who just is learning
how to ride a motorcycle now the
importance of motorcycle boots and
motorcycle gear in general and she said
oh no you'll just you know will wear
hiking boots and you know did two pairs
of jeans or whatever whatever she
thought she was going to be doing she
dropped the bike on the first day of
training and and hurt her ankle I said
ma if you'd had proper riding boots it's
worth the money you wouldn't have had to
deal with this boots are expensive i
paid a couple hundred for those but i
think it's worth it pants pants are
important too so you got armor in the
knees you got armor on the hips I
actually spilled my bike once I spilled
it on a wooden bridge in the rain and
really unfortunate i wasn't going fast I
was going like eight kilometers an hour
so I was I was a hundred percent fine
everything was okay but I was banked my
lucky stars that I was wearing my pants
and my jacket so I know anyone's gonna
anyone who rides is going to see my
textile gear and they're gonna be like
Linus you have textile gear you suck get
leather and you're right I should be
wearing leather however i use my gear in
all types of weather so rain shine I'm
out there on my bike so really leathers
not an option for me will get destroyed
quick fast the way that I use my gear so
for a jacket most important things so
this is one of the really cool tips that
I picked up while I was shopping is you
don't sighs a motorcycle jacket the way
you sighs a real jacket so you see when
I put my hands up like this my wrist is
exposed the sleeve doesn't seem like the
right length that's for a really good
reason that's because when I'm on my
motorcycle and I'm pulling back on the
throttle with my other hand of course
but I have to demo this if the jacket
fit properly and the sleeve was up here
I would be cutting off the circulation
on the back of my hand so that's why it
always fits like this you always test
your motorcycle gear in a riding
position see if it sits in the right
place see if you got all your mobility
find out if the armor is going to shift
so this one's got armor in the elbow
is this one's got armor in the shoulders
it's got a back protector usually get an
aftermarket back protector I should
practice what I preach I don't have one
but the ones that usually come in the
jackets kind of suck and this is about
as waterproof as it gets for a
motorcycle jacket and it's not
waterproof at all and then my gloves so
I wear alpinestars gloves these are SP
SP Stella sp8 yes these are ladies
gloves because I have small lady hands
but they fit me absolutely perfectly and
the one thing where I splurged on
leather I spent over a hundred dollars
on my gloves was gloves because leather
gloves are balling also textile gloves
generally don't have armor built into
the back of them which is extremely
important even in my small spill I fell
over whacked my hand on the back of the
bridge had I not been wearing these
knuckle guards I don't know what would
have happened but you can actually see I
don't actually don't remember which hand
it was yeah it was this one because the
knuckles are all scuffed up and and beat
up from that one incident and I thanked
every every decision that I made about
gear I was very thankful for it that day
because my shoulder didn't get bashed up
my hip didn't get bashed up my knee was
okay my ankle was fine my hand was fine
and act my head never hit the ground but
had it happened I would have been fine
as well except I would have been out
like five hundred bucks I would add to
buy a new helmet so ya see if it
perfectly fingers right in the ends I
have textile gloves too when I'm writing
in the ring so I just carry a couple
I've carry an extra pair gloves in the
in the back of my bike and that's pretty
much it um thank you for checking out
