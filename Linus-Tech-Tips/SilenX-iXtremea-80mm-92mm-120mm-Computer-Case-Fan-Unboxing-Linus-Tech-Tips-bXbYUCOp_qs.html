NCIX this thing it's an extrema eighty
millimeter Pro Series quiet fan so it's
very quiet apparently and this one's a
92 millimeter and this one's a 120
millimeter as you can see it goes from
biggest to smallest okay so let's start
with the big one first it's just okay
son I realize it looks kind of like it's
made of iron but it's not so we're just
gonna you know I don't know we're gonna
plug it in here to check just exactly
how quiet it is
they claim it's very quiet okay right up
like that okay and here's the plug
Wow I don't believe I hear anything this
is quite a nice fan I'd say you know
it's always a trade-off and I quote a
good friend of mine here you can never
have a quiet fan that moves too much air
but this is it's got pretty good airflow
here it's very quiet though I I hear I
hear pretty much nothing so anyways
that's our biggest one um it comes with
you know stuff to mount it to your
computer I guess some bolts and whatnot
and it comes with a plug for plugging it
in in case you didn't figure that out
and your little manual I realized is
pretty simple but they're just making
sure okay oh the manual um well here we
have a sheet of paper with for dandy
pictures on it one is of a screwdriver
and the side of a computer the next one
is also of a screwdriver inside of a
computer the next one is of a fan on the
side of the computer and then we have a
random plug so that's your instructions
should be pretty easy
okay I'm gonna unplug this one now we're
gonna try the next one okay okay this is
the 92 millimeter here
same idea exact same thing just a bit
smaller quite a bit smaller actually
it's got like a there's like one or two
centimeter difference
I'm just checking here so swallowing is
any clot it's any louder or anything no
I still hear completely nothing so you
know if you're writing your computer at
night you're not going to be bothering
anyone else
same idea comes with the exact same
stuff and here is your smallest one for
maybe for a small computer I don't know
same idea just like that much smaller if
you need me to okay uh plenty and we
have a not working fan that doesn't work
let's give it another shot
Oh oh it switched there okay okay now
it's running so this is a just as quiet
very nice very nice alrighty then I
think we're good to go
biggest medium-sized smallest okay very
good so if anyone was wondering who the
identity of the camera man is maybe just
maybe it's been me all along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
