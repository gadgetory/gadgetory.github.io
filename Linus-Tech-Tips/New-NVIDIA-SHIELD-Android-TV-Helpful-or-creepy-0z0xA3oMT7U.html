software that lets you share one Mouse
and one keyboard between multiple
computers we've reviewed it in the past
and it works like magic check out the
link in the video description the
brand-spankin'-new and vidya shield TV
is here and it comes with a lot of
changes it's 4k and HD are ready and it
comes with support for Netflix 4k HDR
and Amazon video 4k HDR and Nvidia is
directly claiming that their device has
more 4k content in terms of shows than
any other smart TV device on the market
which is pretty wicked if you have a TV
that can display that and they even have
360 video support through YouTube if
you're into that kind of thing on the
gaming side of things that still has
access to Nvidia game stream so you can
use your desktop PC to do all the
legwork of actually running your games
and then use your network to send it to
the Nvidia shield and play it on your TV
with like controller pass-through and
all that kind of fun stuff but now in 4k
and HDR which is great just like Netflix
and Amazon and now you have access to
GeForce now so you can pay Nvidia to
access Pascal performance through the
cloud just in case you don't have a
super nice gaming PC already physically
the 16 gigabyte version has gotten 40%
smaller while the 500 gigabyte version
is essentially the same size and it has
retained its old and great-looking
aesthetic but I must add that both of
the new shields have the same Tigra x1
processor that the old shield had
performance wise it's not different and
that means that if you had the previous
shield like I do so this is a nice note
for me you'll just be able to download
software updates and have all of the
software features including ones that I
haven't mentioned yet on your older
shield they also now both have IR
receivers so you can control the volume
on your TV which is absolutely nice as
before it was only compatible with
certain TVs I think most of them are
Sony but whatever also the controller is
getting dual haptic feedback so you can
feel vibrations in your games even with
game stream if you're shooting it over
the network it still works the 16
gigabyte version has a slightly narrowed
down I Oh feature set than the 500 gig I
believe the main lacking feature is SD
cards but I don't expect a huge many
people will use those because there's a
USB port if you also want to put a big
USB Drive that probably makes a little
bit more sense and
both of them have Google assistant just
like the Google home making this a solid
replacement for the Google home
considering the 16 gigabyte version only
costs I think about 60 or $70 more and
has a massively increased feature set
meaning that if you set it up you can do
something like ok Google start my day
and you can have the lights and the
thermostat and the coffeepot I'll turn
on and get ready to go and then when
you're ready to leave you can just say
ok Google I'm leaving and all of those
things can turn off and whatnot to
expand the smart home compatibility you
can plug in a smart things extender and
get stuff like your coffee pots and all
that whatnot extended I believe that's
from Samsung you can pick up one of
those and it's compatible with your
Nvidia shield then there's the Nvidia
spot which will act as a mic and a
speaker and you can plug them in
anywhere in your home and stuff just
little adapter things that go into a
standard wall plug these will expand
your Google assistant throughout your
house for 50 bucks a pop and if that's
really freaking you out a lot you can
put it into privacy mode through the app
on your phone or through the shield
software or possibly a couple other ways
the 16 gigabyte version of the shield
will cost $199 just like before and the
500 gigabyte version will cost $299 also
just like before I'll probably have a
review coming later on thanks again to
synergy for allowing us to be here at
CES synergy is a software download that
allows you to share one Mouse and one
keyboard between multiple computers
regardless of the OS so you'll no longer
confuse which keyboard is for your
Windows workstation which one's for your
Mac one and which one's for your Linux
one so check it out at the link in the
