brought to you by mass drop our first
top 5 drone of CES is the e hang 180 for
autonomous aerial vehicle I mean holy
crap the thing can actually fit a
passenger inside it flies way higher
than your average consumer drone but
much lower than a jetliner at about
11,000 feet and can go 60 miles per hour
for about 23 minutes you don't need any
previous flying experience you just tell
it to take off or land through a mobile
app and a computer takes care of the
rest like a commercial airplane it has
redundancies built in such as multiple
power delivery systems and an auto land
feature if something goes wrong and
encryption is built into the flight
system to keep attackers from sabotaging
your flight path it's connected to a
knee hang command center that monitors
every 184 drone in flight kind of like
air traffic control and right now the
biggest hurdle is approval from
authorities like the FAA but eing says
it's working with government agencies to
get this thing off the ground so to
speak
it'll cost probably somewhere between
200 and 300 thousand dollars so you can
choose between this thing a house or
going to medical school the parrot disco
is not a quadcopter it's got a sleek
aesthetic and looks like an airplane
with wings
it's powered by a propeller and this
combined with the wings uses less energy
than trying to power up a bunch of
spinning blades it adds up to 45 minutes
of total flight time and it is pretty
darn fast capable of 50 mile per hour
flight it features automatic takeoff you
just throw it and it starts flying
meaning that there's no real learning
curve and piloting is just a matter of
telling it where you want it to go or
turn to adjustments to make the thing
stay airborne are handled automatically
and it's expected to be available later
this year our third drone continues our
trend of getting smaller and smaller
with the power-up fpv this is another
wing design drone except that it's
essentially a paper airplane that you
can fly and we actually have covered
power ups previous product before for
more than five seconds and
see where it's going it only weighs two
ounces and is made from thick paper and
powered by a pair of propellers you do
have to fold it yourself which is either
a pain or fun for the DIY included folks
and it comes with a head mounted display
thing to turn piloting into a VR
experience simply by sliding in your
smartphone it's got an autopilot feature
to keep the plane in the air and can go
up to 20 miles per hour with 10 hours of
battery life power up is offering a
racing package that comes with six
drones and head mounted displays for a
thousand bucks or you can get just one
for a hundred and eighty dollars it's
expected to be available in June the
unique typhoon h was featured by Intel
at CES why because it has an intel
realsense camera so intel has been
pushing realsense pretty heavily in
laptops and other devices now it's in a
drone the realsense cameras are
completely separate from the main camera
which shoots 4k video by the way and
allows the typhoon to avoid objects and
obstacles automatically without any
input from the user
unique and Intel are touting this as
being more accurate than other forms of
collision detection that we've already
seen in drones the only issue is that at
$17.99 at for the base model it's not
exactly cheap and the version with
realsense collision avoidance will cost
more finally we've got the fly one of
the strangest looking drones at the show
as it looks like a floating white sphere
or ball why well the moving parts are
all enclosed in a plastic ball for
safety for indoor use being the main
focus it's very light as well only 1
pounds though it does look heavier
making it good for kids or someone who
just doesn't want to worry too much
about damaging their stuff in the event
of a collision it only features 10
minutes of flight time but it's
surprisingly nimble given the shape as
long as you're willing to pay $1,200 for
it this drone video was brought to you
by mass drop if you don't know what mass
drop is basically it's a great place to
