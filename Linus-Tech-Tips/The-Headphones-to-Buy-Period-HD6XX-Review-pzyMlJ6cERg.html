6xx whatever it is you want to call it I
bought my pair of them along with a
selection of cans from the likes of
Bayer dynamic AKG Odyssey and Audio
Technica back in late 2013 when I was
working on a review of some other
audiophile headphones and I realized
that I lacked the context to discuss
their place in the market anyway while I
was able to achieve the context I
desired for one reason or another I
never actually got around to reviewing
any of those contextual headphones in
the case of the Sennheiser HD 600
specifically it was because while I
loved them and they became I still to
this day daily driver about a year later
they are very very similar replacement
the HD 650 s already existed and I
wasn't going to run out and drop another
$400 on the same damn product so that I
could make a video that would already be
10 years past its best before date but
there's good news mass drop is in the
house with their Sennheiser HD 6 xx mass
drop Edition aka the excuse to have
Brandon shoot seven minutes of gorgeous
b-roll on the 20 year old product that I
think is awesome not to mention spoiler
alert and unbelievable value
Corsairs ml fans feature magnetic
levitation technology and custom
engineered rotors to provide a high
performance low noise experience learn
more at the link in the video
description so let's kick this off with
what exactly makes the Sennheiser HD 6 X
X a mass drop Edition product not much
compared to the HD 650 it features a
shorter cord that terminates in a three
and a half millimeter jack instead of a
quarter inch jack oh there's an adapter
two quarter inch if you want and the
plastic colour scheme has been changed
from a speckled grey to a really dark
almost black matte blue that feels a
little cheap IMO and that's it their
matte blue HD 650 s with a 50 inch cable
and a smaller connector on the end and
oh right wait for it this is where I
dropped the big change the bomb they've
got a cheaper black and white packaging
I've got my confirmation from Sennheiser
directly that unlike previous mass drop
Edition products like the k7 xx nothing
has been altered acoustically so then
for the uninitiated what are the HD 650
s and why should you care they are along
with their close siblings the HD 600 and
HD 580 one of the most famous audiophile
headphones in the world whose
performance has been chased by other
manufacturers at this price point since
the release of the original over 20
years ago in 1993 and whose sound
signature I would say even more so than
the flagship HD 800 series is
identifiable as the Sennheiser sound
since from my experience it bears more
similarity to the company's lower end
products just better so that is to say
they're not accurate in the same sense
that a studio monitor might be accurate
they don't have a totally flat frequency
response curve but this is by design to
make them less fatiguing and more
natural sounding on human ears where
they're intended to be worn and they
don't make the mistake that many
mainstream headphones do today of
overdoing the bass
at the expense of the clarity of
everything else because that's what
sells to Millennials they sound great
whether you listen to them out of the
box or tune the EQ because you do like a
little bit more thump on the subjective
out of the box the included cables are
replaceable so you can go bananas
replacing them and you can run out and
buy a shit audio valhalla 2 headphone
amplifier but in spite of their 300 ohm
impedance they also destroy just about
anything else at this price point
running off of an iPhone so just because
you don't have additional budget for an
app today doesn't mean I would stay away
from them with that said though even
fans of the HD 600 series don't believe
that they are perfect they are not a
fashion statement and are definitely
part of the reason that the original
monster beats by dre was able to storm
onto the personal audio scene in 2008 by
not looking stupid even though they
didn't work without a battery in them
suffered from subpar build quality and
sounded like thumpy ass but at least the
HD 600 series is comfortable clamping
pressure out of the box might be a
little tighter than some would like and
the earcup foam isn't the softest memory
foam known to man or anything like that
that award is reserved for the bose qc25
s but they break in very nicely over
time to the point where it's easy for me
to forget that I'm wearing mine entirely
but a part of that too I think is the
open backed design of the HD 600 series
the benefit of this is the natural sound
of the music movies or games that you're
listening to with the drawback being
though that ambient noise can be
disruptive and well let's just say I
wouldn't flip on some really loud angry
porn with your mom in the next room
because everyone around you knows
exactly what you're listening to which
leads me then pretty well into a
conclusion that is both obvious and very
difficult for me to write on the one
hand I feel the need to defend myself
from the incoming barrage of comments
criticizing me for giving a positive
review to a product available
exclusively from one of our sponsors
but on the other hand I can use
literally any headphone I want I
literally have more than one shelf of
headphones and headsets ranging anywhere
from 50 bucks to over a thousand and
these or ones almost exactly like them
are the ones on my desk at home so for
some of you that won't be enough and
that's fine - steel tips whatever for
the rest of you go grab some HD 6 X X's
assuming there are any left the 350 that
I paid second hand felt like a good deal
already $200 brand-new is an absolutely
unreal value for these enjoy today in
front of me I've got the bloody gaming
peripheral line up from a4 text they
sent us a bunch of their products
they're d500 gaming headset which has
got 40 millimeter drivers an inline mic
and is 39.99 on Newegg for a limited
time there be 720 keyboard which is a
full layout keyboard that comes with 8
silicon key caps as well as an extended
palm rest there ZL 50 mouse is Driver
free and comes with on a vago 9800
sensor and there B 0 70 is a smooth
surface mousepad that I was getting it
