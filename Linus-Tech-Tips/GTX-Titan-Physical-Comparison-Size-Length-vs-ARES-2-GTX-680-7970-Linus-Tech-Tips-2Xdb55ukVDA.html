when you hear Titan foreign videos
latest graphics card is it must be
absolutely huge actually it's not that
big so the Titan is compared to previous
generation GeForce graphics cards like
the 680 which was up till now the
highest end single GPU kepler card is
pretty much the same compared to a last
generation dual GPU card the GTX 590 it
is shorter it is shorter than a 590 oh
that's cool okay so it's shorter than a
590 when we go way back to the launch
premium Fermi card we find out the
tightness no exactly the same but how
does it compare to other GPUs that you
might have in your system just for
comparison sake so this right here is a
reference GeForce GTX 650 Ti yeah that's
a 650 Ti right yeah it's a 650 Ti so
this guy right here is only a mere 6
inches long so by comparison the Titan
which I'm going to swap out right here
actually you know what let's have the
Titan here for comparison with
everything else so that's a 6 inch card
so you want to check your case because
the Titan is going to fit as long as
your case accepts GPUs that are 27
centimeters or 10 and a half inches in
length so here's a 6-inch card okay
here's a 560 ti reference card for
comparison so that right there is a 9
inch card so you can see there's an
extra inch and a half here I'm just
gonna bring out the 680 again so the 670
remember is the same length as the 680
so actually the titan is a touch longer
than a 680 I was wrong about that so the
680 is a 10-inch card and the titan is
as we measured before a 10 and a half
inch card finally the 7970 which is the
closest thing to a competitor for a
single GPU card from the red camp is 11
inches long now this
a funny decision that AMD made because
you can see right here the PCB is not
actually 11 inches long the PCB is only
about 10 and wow look at that 10 and a
half inches so it could have easily been
the same length as the Titan but they
opted to go with an extra bit of plastic
on the other and which was a very odd
decision so it's a single GPU card that
has a PCB that's as big as a 690 or a
590 why did they do that well a couple
things so it has six gigs of memory so
it's loaded up to the nines with memory
on this side and on the other side it
also has one of the largest GPU with 7.1
billion transistors ever made so you're
gonna have to have a very complicated
power delivery system in order to make
sure that that bad boy stays fed it has
a beastly cooler so you can see there's
a huge aluminum thin stack both on this
side on this side which is over top of a
vapor chamber and last but not least why
does it need that complex VRM that's for
GPU boost 2.0 which dynamically adjusts
the voltage the fan speed and the clock
speed of the card to hit various targets
which are actually user definable on
this particular card so what would it
look like in a small chassis because one
of the great things about Titan is it
actually performs better and runs
quieter than gtx 680 so this is what it
would look like in the kind of enclosure
where you might often see a gtx titan
this enclosure accepts up to a 280
millimeter card and you can see titan
fits in there just nicely this is an ITX
case and i think that pretty much wraps
it up for our physical size look at the
GeForce GTX Titan don't forget to
subscribe to - tech tips from on
unboxings reviews and other computer -
oh I forgot something whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa we were almost oh yes ah ok so
when we're talking thousand-dollar video
cards like the Titan then we have to
start talking about other super uber
expensive video cards like say for
example the a soos Aries - so this guy
right here is a liquid-cooled
dual 7970 gigahertz Edition car
that comes with an extra radiator and is
as you can clearly see much larger than
a Titan so if you're concerned about a
Titan fitting in your case you better be
really concerned about this guy it's
almost a foot long right there it is
actually taller than a standard board so
a standard board would actually be only
about four inches high
whereas this board is five inches high
so there's a full extra inch along the
top plus it requires a radiator to
actually cool the dual GPU so that's a
thick single 120 millimeter radiator
stay tuned and don't forget to subscribe
- tech tips because we will be testing
the Titan against the Aries - to see who
is the king of the ludicrously fast
expensive GPUs although probably more
appropriate test would be two areas twos
versus three Titans because that would
then be about the same price I don't
know if we can get our hands on three
Titans in two areas twos but yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
