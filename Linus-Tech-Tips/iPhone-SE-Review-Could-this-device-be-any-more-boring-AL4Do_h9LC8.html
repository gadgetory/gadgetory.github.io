exciting product that Apple has launched
since like some random iPod Touch
refresh but I spent a couple of weeks
with it knowing full well that I
wouldn't be switching to it as a daily
driver because in addition to giving my
impressions on the iPhone se this felt
like a good opportunity to discuss
Apple's direction in general right now
so let's get crack-a-lackin'
intel skull Canyon Nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more at the link in
the video description the iPhone se
packs truly flagship specifications into
an unapologetically small 4-inch screen
form factor for little girls
and men who happen to have little girl
sized hands it boasts apple's latest a9
processor the same one found in the 6s
and the 6s plus two gigs of ram the same
12 megapixel camera sensor found in the
6s AC Wireless lte-advanced NFC for
Apple pay a 1624 milliamp hour non
removable battery and an IPS 640 by 11
36 Retina display and there's a lot to
like about that I mean honestly it's the
kind of product whose merits I've been
arguing for since the phablet race
started a handful of years ago asking
who means 1440p r 4k phone screens who
can operate these things with one hand
to which the answer was always bigger is
better and use two hands bitch but there
are of course some compromises to be
made here some of them are minor the
storage speed has been downgraded
somewhat but not to the point where it's
likely to bother anyone and the same
goes IMO for the slower Wi-Fi and LTE
advanced I mean I haven't had an issue
streaming YouTube videos
TeamViewer desktops or music in years
and actually can't figure out what
people need these ever climbing data
speeds for but there are a few things
that ground my gears a bit more the
inclusion of an NFC radio for Apple pay
gets 4-inch device users closer to
feature parity with current generation
devices than they were before but touch
ID was already present on the iPhone 5s
and it even uses the same older slower
and less accurate first-generation
sensor though in practice this didn't
end up bothering me much and the other
big thing missing is 3d touch having a
right-click is always better than not
having one always Apple and that's what
3d touch effectively is so ignoring the
distinctly last
janne industrial design with only a pink
color option and a sandblasted versus
polished edge to distinguish it from the
5s the lack of a push harder to do more
stuff faster button is the most outdated
feeling thing about this device I mean
of course aside from the fact that Apple
is still equipping a four hundred US
dollar smartphone with 16 gigs of
on-board storage and no SD card
expansion making the cost of this device
effectively $500 for anyone who intends
to use the 12 megapixel stills 4k video
over your camera so let's talk about
that camera now then jelly
it lacks optical image stabilization
like the 6 and the 6s but it's
characteristically really good it opens
and focuses quickly it's got a two-tone
flash and the full auto mode gets it
right the vast majority of the time the
Zoe skip excuse me
live photo mode is great for capturing
moving objects like children but the app
just sucks I actually used to prefer
apples hands off the wheel approach to
phone pictures but that was back when a
great phone camera shot and a decent
phone camera shot both kind of looked
like trash and when Android phone makers
were baking all these weird half-baked
like put dinosaurs and fish all over the
scene functionalities in I mean these
days a Samsung device can take videos
and photos with as much or as little
control as I want from the same screen
with one tap when Apple still requires
swiping through modes one by one with
their extremely limited first party app
or opening an entirely separate in the
case of camera plus $3 app to enable
manual control just for stills I mean
that coupled with their lack of a screen
off gesture to launch the camera made it
noticeably slower for me to capture
unexpected moments with that said though
that's about all I can criticize about
the SE from a performance perspective
actually using the device is about like
using my old iPhone 4 if my iPhone 4 was
the equivalent of a Pontiac Firefly with
an 8
engine in it and they did this
remarkably without hurting battery life
which isn't to say I don't still think
there's room for improvement I mean can
you imagine living on a planet where you
could buy a phone with iOS is idle power
management and your typical Android
handsets 2500 to 3500 milliamp hour
battery the SE on most days would
actually best the s6 and the z5 compact
for me for percentage remaining at the
end of the day but then on heavy days I
could run out of battery by desert still
impressive though considering its size
and raw horsepower with that said it's
shocking to me after all the moaning
that I've done about smaller devices
being better for people with smaller
hands how much less I personally found
myself using this phone due to its
smaller screen it's frustrating how
little real estate is left for the
actual conversation I'm having once
you've got the keyboard on there and
during my veg time watching videos on
curiosity stream or whatever I actually
found myself more than once running
upstairs for a tablet something I really
haven't felt I needed to do in a long
time which I guess leads us into the
conclusion it strange to be saying this
so soon after giving Apple my best
smartphone of 2015 award for the iPhone
6s only a few short months ago but it
seems like the accountants are running
certain aspects of the company at this
point instead of the designers Apple's
own words people wanted a smaller better
iPhone says it all
the iPhone se is a carefully engineered
and carefully timed response to this
feedback one that brings existing
customers who were on the brink of a
somewhat forced obsolescence and all
64-bit app store is going to happen soon
an iPhone 5 and below users will be on
the outside looking in and potential
customers in developing markets an
obvious and the lower cost way to stay
in or enter the Apple ecosystem it's a
strong business move but there's really
no artistry or innovation or pride in it
it's just cheaper they reused the older
blockier design language because they
want
to look and feel cheaper to drive
customers who can afford it to the much
higher margin 6s and 6s plus mean
remember those contain basically the
same hardware and if you've ever bought
a replacement screen on eBay that should
give you some idea what the cost of a
4-inch versus a 4.7 inch screen is
pretty much the same but this move
delivers zero innovation Apple's
customers are crying we want you to
remake that thing we liked from before
but faster and they're doing it it's
about the least Apple manner of behaving
that I can possibly imagine I mean I
don't always agree with apples choices
but I respect that they have the guts to
make what they think is best and then
educate their customers about how that
should enrich their lives and while the
objective likely one from the bean
counters of build a lower cost skew to
maintain the install base and improve
gross profit dollars at the cost of some
margin has pretty much been accomplished
here I have some serious misgivings
about what this means for apples
direction as a company over the coming
years maybe the iPhone 7 will completely
prove me wrong
maybe I'll be able to rearrange the
icons on my home screen the way I want I
guess we'll find out in the fall ok so I
know that there are some of you who
complain about our phone reviews always
having these D brand skins on the phone
saying that you find them ugly so I said
to D Brad I was like look you guys you
got that great configurator on your site
where you can pick out exactly you know
what type of skin you want on which part
of the phone you can you can preview it
on the site and see what it's going to
look like in person so if you guys about
this great configurator why are you guys
always picking the color scheme and
sending it to me and people are
complaining at why are we doing this let
me pick the color scheme this time so
they did and I used D brands
configurator to cover the iPhone se and
what I think is the most beautiful vinyl
skin that I have ever seen in my life I
mean look at this I have one two three
four five different colors if you count
wood grain as one color because it's got
multiple colors to it it's like wood
grain and with the skin not only is my
phone look great it is protected from
incidental scratches the kinds that come
about during life so check it out get
your D brand skin they ship worldwide
and they're affordable at the link in
