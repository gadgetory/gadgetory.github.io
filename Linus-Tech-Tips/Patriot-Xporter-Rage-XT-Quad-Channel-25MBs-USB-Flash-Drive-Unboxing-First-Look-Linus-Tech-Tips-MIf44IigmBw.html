hasn't really seen any innovation in the
last little while I mean yeah they've
gotten smaller they've gotten bigger but
this is finally something cool this is
the Patriot transporter xt rage no I
don't think it's sexy at all yeah
transporter xt rage i was totally right
ok this is a quad channel USB flash
drive it's available in a bunch of
different capacities and it offers up to
25 megabytes per second write speeds so
that is way faster than pretty much any
other USB Drive that doesn't have quad
channel performance comes with a 25 year
warranty from patriot and I guess let's
open it up shall we okay so if I can
I've been turning it over trying to
figure out how to open the box and I
still actually don't know so I'm going
to resort to using my trusty knife and
maybe you split it that looks dangerous
and I look there's a USB plug on the
back no that's the front ok so we sliced
something i'm not sure if we slice the
right thing ok txt rage coming up little
guy when it comes out there might be
much maybe 30 right there we go we've
extracted it from the packaging always
be careful when opening packaging not
everyone is a professional on boxer do
not attempt this at home oh yeah that's
how it works cool so that's the
transporter xt rage it's got a little
loop for a key or for a little piece of
string that you put through there and
then you can hang it off your keychain
or whatever else you want and then it's
also got a USB interface here and it's
eight gigs and how about this here's a
stunning new development I'm going to
test it
here's an idea ok so I'm going to plug
it into my computer here alright plugs
in just like that now it is a little bit
on the big side it was detected right
away okay just a second it's closed all
my windows you never know what kind of
personal information might be there
someone saw my my personal msn a little
while ago and I had a bunch of people
adding me to msn I apologize to everyone
who added me to msn and I did not add
them back but my msn is strictly for RL
friends and family so don't be offended
please ok so let's try and find
something here why don't i copy my audio
surf music folder over to the rage xt
wow that's fast okay so 17 megabyte 21
megabytes per second 16 megabytes per
second and that was with a bunch of
small files ok ok forget that forget
that let's find let's find something
that's um like bigger okay here here
here we'll find something that I'm not
going to show you as I browse all my
folders and files so you can you can
look at my g15 keyboard for now and
let's find what can I find that has to
be something here ok yeah yeah yeah
we'll just do like a big blog video file
because blog video files are not
downloaded from the internet and they
are completely people I own all the
rights to these I think ok so it was up
to 23 megabytes per second there for a
sec oh this is highly inaccurate I hate
this stupid thing it's never right
anyway we saw when we were transferring
the music it went up above 20 megabytes
per second but I don't know if it's
actually measuring it in any meaningful
way anyway you can see that i'm
transferring a 2.7 gigabyte file and i'm
transferring it to this USB thumb drive
and it's going pretty fast and yeah i
guess that's pretty much it there you go
that's what you connects
backed out of real world performance
it's possible if we formatted it
properly and didn't just plug it into
the computer and go that we might get
slightly better results and this may not
be accurate at all in fact it might be
transferring it 150 megabytes per second
for all we know but Windows doesn't seem
to measure things the same way that
everybody does so it's impossible to
tell thank you for checking out my
unboxing and quick performance test of
the Patriot transporter xt rage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
