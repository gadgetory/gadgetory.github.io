again seriously if it wasn't so
expensive I would just buy an apartment
here at this point anyway the event
today is to celebrate the upcoming
Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018
they're gonna be sponsoring some amazing
athletes some of which are even here
today and this is also my first look at
Team USA's official year and a handful
of contactless payment methods that visa
is going to be introducing exclusively
for the Winter Olympics next year all
right check-in time all they have is VIP
so I guess I'll go with one of those
next up the Nigerian women's bobsled
team is here so naturally they hold a
full sized bobsled into the event this
is authentic right what's not work so
anyway if they qualify they would be the
first-ever bobsled team from the entire
continent of Africa male or female to
compete in the Winter Games and then
right around the corner we get into what
is pretty much the main event this is
the NBC shopping experience and there
are a few noteworthy things here this is
my first look at any Pyeongchang 2018
gear and they've got an absolute ton of
it on display here there's stuffies of
the official mascots and a bunch of
really good-looking Team USA gear
they've got scarves the jackets look
great although I have to say I am
partial to the toque excuse me up beanie
then once I'm in the shop and I've
decided I want to buy something we get
to have a look at a really cool
implementation of contactless payment
that visa is showing off here so the
underlying technology isn't anything new
but now it's built into one of three
collectible items to celebrate the
Winter Games there's a pin which is
actually on sale already in South Korea
and a cute little sticker and this one's
really neat there's actually a pair of
payment enabled gloves that will be
available exclusively in South Korea
during the Winter Olympics and then all
of them have built in payment so I
wanted to
you guys a closer look at this but I'm
already getting the evil eye for even
lifting up the case that much these are
prototypes they're not in the final
version so they wouldn't let me take
them out from under the glass so what
I'll do is I'll show you how it all
works with the pin as my demo basically
you walk up to any terminal just like
you normally would get the little
confirmation animation and boom you are
done okay then so on the surface these
items seem pretty superfluous especially
in a high-tech place like South Korea
but there's actually a bit more to this
idea than meets the eye these souvenirs
come pre-loaded with South Korean Won
you can just wave your pin or your hand
or your sticker at the terminal and off
you go with some gear a nice cup of hot
chocolate from the concession stand or
whatever else it is that you want so
it's not a replacement for the payment
options that already exist it's just a
way of showing off how contact lists has
the potential to do even more for
cashless convenience than the plastic
cards that we're using now so thanks to
Visa for sponsoring this trip out here
thanks to you guys for watching if you
just like this video you know what to do
but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured which
would involve a trip to South Korea but
hey the Winter Games are gonna be there
so that's not such a terrible thing and
hey while you're down in the description
our merch store is down there with cool
shirts like this one and we've also got
our community forum linked oh my VIP
badges turned around</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
