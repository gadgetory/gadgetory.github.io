wow
this is really heavy this is I'm fairly
certain the most expensive thing I have
ever unboxed this is the petabyte
project and what is a petabyte well a
petabyte is a thousand terabytes a
thousand terabytes of storage
I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
gaming laptops feature Intel seventh
generation core i7 processors check them
out at the link below
so I guess this is where we start I mean
what does a petabyte look like
physically well we've got one box then
we got two boxes and actually look at
this there's another box inside I hope I
don't break the table inside all these
boxes are 110 terabytes
Seagate enterprise helium-filled drives
a hundred of them so a hundred times ten
for those of you who attended the same
math school that I went to is 800
terabytes and you'll get that joke a
little bit better later so how do you
transport a hundred hard drives I was
actually legitimately curious myself
because I've I've never had a hundred
hard drives delivered to me before
the answer is apparently via couriers
that don't even need labels on the
outsides of the boxes these really don't
seem like they're doing a lot I mean
they sprinkled some peanuts on there
good job if it's broken I'll forgive
them oh you know what I am just going
all like Tarzan on this thing there we
go
you know think about hard drives you you
pick up one of them off the table they
don't really seem that heavy to pick up
plenty of them we start to get pretty
heavy pretty fast so we actually
probably have to get like
into these boxes open
now how did they end up with this random
mishmash of packing materials let's see
how many different types of packing
material we can find one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten up ten
packing materials this one all has the
same packing material in it so here it
is this is what's inside more packing
material I mean their hard drives
they're kind of fragile the fall makes
sense but here we go ah so I guess now
then is a good opportunity to talk about
what drives for using these RC gates
enterprise capacity v6 helium-filled
drives and we're using them for a number
of reasons so number one is these are in
the same series of drives as what we'd
use in the past in both our vaults as
well as our off-site backup server but
with some technological advancements so
since we built the original long-term
archived vault mutant server Seagate has
gone from 6 terabytes to 10 terabytes on
their maximum capacity drive and number
two is that thanks to their
helium-filled enclosures they are more
efficient than ever
b4 there's also a degree of trust that
comes with a choice like this and using
something that has served us incredibly
well in now both the vault and our
off-site backup was a fairly easy
decision to make but of course a bunch
of drive is just a bunch of drives until
you actually put it into a machine
so here representing the store Nader
that I will actually be using since it's
upgraded with a better drive mounting
mechanism and LCD and all that good
stuff is my old story inator 45 drive
edition that I use as like a bench
server now so why we like store Nader's
couple of reasons number one is they're
actually reasonably affordable for like
machines that can hold anywhere from 45
to 60 Drive number two is that we have
found them again it comes down to stuff
we've used in the past incredibly
reliable so instead of having a SAS or
SATA expander set up with backplanes
they actually directly attach every
single drive to the HBA cards in the
system through dedicated cables so it
just means there's less junk to go wrong
and therein except for one small problem
- hold on a second even if this was the
60 Drive model and it had an entire
additional Bank of drives you would
still have an entire counter top full of
drives over here what's the deal with
that how you going to actually have one
petabyte of storage on the server great
question so unfortunately we love on
raid but we can't use on raid for this
project because right now on reed is
limited to only one array per system and
30 drives per array so we had to look
beyond that it looks like what we're
going to be using is two of the 60 drive
models each with 50 drives in it give or
take and we're going to be using some
flavor of Linux either cent OS or Ubuntu
running ZFS so we're going to divide up
all the drives into Vedas which is a
sort of software rate then on top of
that we're going to be running something
called cluster FS cluster FF has some
really cool advantages number one it's
free and open source and number two it
allows us to take these multiple servers
and effectively make them transparent to
every other computer on the network as
one machine pretty cool advantage number
two and this is really neat is that it
has native support for SSD cheering so I
don't have them yet but okay I can't
lift you up to show you where they're
going to go wow this is heavy but
Seagate is also sending two of their
seven plus terabyte PCI Express nitro
cards that are going to fit in each of
these machines and act as a high speed
high I opt cache in front of the
mechanical drives the only real
disadvantage of this approach is the
usual disadvantage that comes with any
type of raid we are not going to get the
full one petabyte it looks like the
configuration I'm going to use is going
to leave us with about
eight hundred terabytes is like I'm
starting to think I'm not even going to
bother doing this project at all because
I mean what what's the point of even
continuing at that point only 800
terabytes of storage okay sorry I regain
my composure the last question that some
of you probably have about this project
why on earth do you guys need a petabyte
a freaking storage and the answer is
pretty simple we archive everything
should we archive everything I don't
know I'll leave that up to you but I'm a
bit of a data pack rat so we archive
absolutely everything and we recently
upgraded to the 8k camera that you guys
are watching this super sharp super
crisp footage on so we have build up our
170 terabyte archive machine we needed
to upgrade to something and this looked
like a super relatively cost effective
way to handle it and one that allows us
to not dramatically change our
infrastructure we can expand it in the
future by sliding in more story Nader's
full of drives they could even have
different drives you just have to
configure your bricks differently or
moving further into the future we may
look at tape archive for anything that
doesn't fit on the on the hot server The
Spinners so there you have it
this is petabyte project let me do that
differently Rick and I like projects it
slices it dices it takes apart your
devices and puts them back together
it's the protec toolkit from iFixit and
I absolutely love it I love endorsing
this thing because you basically cannot
go wrong with it it includes their 64
bit driver kit which means that it runs
on Windows Vista 64-bit just kidding
it's sexually screw driver bits not
computer bits and a whole bunch of other
fantastic tools as well including their
extension for the screwdriver their ESD
safe tweezers their reverse tweezers
their plastic opening tools their
suction cups their Jimmy pride two older
their metal spudger basically everything
you could want it at all has a lifetime
warranty so head over to ifixit.com /
lioness use their great guides to repair
and fix your devices and use code - to
save five bucks on your very own pro
tech tool kit so thanks for watching
guys if you just like this video you
know where that button is but if you
liked it hit the like button get
subscribed we have t-shirts we have a
place where you can buy all this stuff
we've got all that links we've got our
community forum all that's good stuff
now that you're done doing all those
things you're probably wondering what to
watch next check out our latest video
over on channel super fun trying to do
my outro faster I realize I'm not
helping my kids right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
