the z77 xud 4h from gigabyte this is
sort of a lowest that I would recommend
motherboard because when you go any
lower than this you start to compromise
features that matter and this is where
you start to get into the features that
I think matter the most without spending
an exorbitant amount of money on things
that most people don't use so for
example you've gotten let's support for
all the latest core i3 i5 and i7
processors you've got there fully
digital power design as well as their 3d
dual UEFI BIOS which basically makes it
almost impossible to brick one of their
boards by flashing the bios or whatever
else you get crossfire and SLI
compatibility it does support virtue MVP
which is basically the way that you can
use the onboard graphics on your cpu in
order to transcode video and use your
dedicated graphics for gaming pcie gen3
is a given these days ultra durable for
is pretty much all the old ultra durable
stuff in addition to the new blast
fabric PCB that makes it humidity
resistant all digital power so CPU
graphics memory and the uncor as it used
to be called I have no idea what we call
it now apparently vtt and then they
talked a little bit about load line
calibration versus not load line
calibration although it's very debatable
you know lots of people believe you
should use it and shouldn't use it
here's a closer look at what their PCB
design looks like Intel Smart Response
allows you to use an SSD to cash your
hard drive to make it go faster
surprisingly few people use it but they
should it's awesome and they're easy
Smart Response utility is actually the
easiest way to set up Smart Response and
it only works on gigabyte boards I have
used it before and it's awesome
electrostatic protection is cool so what
it amounts to is for example many
motherboard manufacturers will do one
fuse for sort of all bunch of USB ports
whereas gigabyte does one fuse purport
so if something gets zapped at least
you're going to lose less of the
functionality of your board included
accessories are pretty bare-bones so you
got four SATA cables an SLI bridge
remember crossfire bridges are included
with your graphics card I gigabyte
sticker multilingual installation guide
book a user's manual a driver disk which
you aren't going to use and you're going
to download the latest off the
manufacturer website and of course a
color-coded IO shield look at all that
that USB 3
that'd be all over this board because it
has not only the intel USB 3 that comes
with the z77 chipset but also sent
another third-party USB 3 gigabyte has
done such a good job of cleaning up
their color schemes over the last couple
of generations so I'm going to start in
the place that I usually do which is the
cpu socket got lots of room around there
for large coolers as well as lots of
cooling for your MOSFETs so it looks
like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so that's
probably like an eight plus three phase
power design or something along those
lines either way it's using gayton
thymine yeah quite frankly with an ivy
bridge cpu as long as you've got a good
quality board which is again why sort of
recommend starting at that UD for range
you're not going to be limited in your
overclocking endeavours by your CPU
power delivery unless you're going
sub-zero or doing something exotic this
is ample for air and water cooling we've
got a single 8-pin CPU connector up here
which is all you need for an ivy bridge
cpu you've got a clear CMOS button as
well as a reset switch and the power
switch up here at the top right you've
got for ddr3 slot supporting up to 32
gigs of ddr3 memory your 24-pin
connector and it's ideal slot along the
right and you've got an auxiliary aceite
connector this is kind of handy if you
are installing multiple high-powered
graphics card so if you're going to
throw a couple gtx 690 s in here or
something i do recommend plugging in a
SATA connector and it'll give a little
bit more power to those graphics card
slots and reduce the risk of burning out
any of the pins on your 24 pin here
front USB 3 is over here on the right
this is where I do like to see it
although a right angle connector would
be even better and over here we've got
state of three off the intel chipset say
22 off the intel chipset so two of those
and four of those and more say 23 off of
a third-party chipset we've also got a
front post indicator LED as well as the
front panel connectors and the bios
switch which switches between bios 1 and
bios to which are two physical chips on
the board itself three USB to point out
here on the bottom as well as the
trusted platform module and front panel
audio no firewire on this board that's
starting to disappear even on fully
featured boards like this one and four
our pci express slot load out i think
it's pretty solid actually so if you
have a single dual slot graphics card
installed that's going to leave you with
one two PCIe you one x two pcie 16x
physical and a pci however bear in mind
guys that this is 16 x physical if you
populate both of these it's going to be
8 x 8 x this is an 8x lot and this one
is a 4x that runs off the chipset itself
as opposed to off of the cpu so i
wouldn't recommend populating this with
a graphics card and this pci slot will
be covered by a dual graphics card
solution but what that means is going to
be left with 11 and 4 left for a further
expansion which if you're running a dual
graphics card setup you probably have a
pretty high in computer anyway so I
understand gigabytes rationale when they
did that in terms of fan connectors we
got 124 pin 3 4 pin 4 4 pin 5 4 pin ah
ah ah which is pretty good you have full
support for configuring those within the
BIOS matte black PCB which I've started
to take for granted i remember i used to
rant and rave about how awesome it is
but there are other little details that
matter check out the way gigabytes using
screws as opposed to plastic push pins
to keep on all the cooling that means
that no matter what happens in transit
your board will probably arrive in a
working condition and finally on the
back check out all that USB 3 you've got
six USB 3.0 ports DVI vga hdmi and
displayport out ps2 keyboard mouse combo
port is included optical audio out is
included to esata ports gigabit ethernet
and 7.1 audio and check this out
gigabytes also built in a dedicated USB
keyboard and mouse ports here this is to
increase compatibility as well as
sometimes what manufacturers do is they
include ports that are optimized for a
1000 Hertz polling rate which gives you
that extra little tiny edge in terms of
responsiveness assuming your keyboard
and mouse do support that feature so
high temperature protection on off
charge so even if the computers power
down you can charge devices using USB
and all Japanese solid caps which we've
again started to take for granted at
this point and oh right don't forget
gigabytes 3x power for their USB ports
meaning that you can charge device
is faster and you can run more devices
time pointing at the SATA ports you can
run more devices off their USB ports
without using a powered hub just
passively don't forget to subscribe to
