who found which is one of those things
that manufacturers claim that often
makes me kind of I can't really do it
but whatever raise an eyebrow because
huge sound is not the same thing as good
sound however Ultimate Ears has enough
of a reputation for sound that isn't
horrible that I was like okay normally
when manufacturers contact me they're
like wow yeah we've got this Bluetooth
battery-powered speaker you guys totally
unbox and check it out I'm kind of like
hmm
because who cares there's so many of
them so I tend to focus on the ones that
offer something interesting like the
raucous which is solar powered the
rugged ruckus which is solar powered and
is like splash resistant and drop proof
and all that kind of cool stuff so with
ultimate years I was like okay I'm
interested in you because you've got a
brand name to protect here so it better
not sound bad the jam box from jawbone
sounds bad it was one of the first ones
though so I guess it can get a bit of a
pass but let's cover the features of the
mini boom it has a 10-hour battery it's
Bluetooth it supports for ipod iphone
ipad and pretty much anything else it's
bluetooth but to branding it's got a 50
foot range it obviously has a built-in
speakerphone just like all of them do
it's available in a variety of colors
and like four or five different colors
but you can see them all on the website
and it has kind of a unique shape to it
it's pretty rugged looking I guess it's
not actually meant to sit like that
there you go it it knows it knows what's
up get it what's up because the buttons
go up so speaking of the buttons you've
got volume up volume down
these are nice little tactile buttons as
well as your bluetooth pairing button on
the side over here you've got some
Ultimate Ears branding on the bottom
you've got some information that's hard
to read some more Ultimate Ears branding
speaker grille power switch as well as
three-and-a-half millimeter and microUSB
for charging there's a port there for
bass presumably and on the front is yet
another speaker grille so we got a
couple colors because they have another
feature that we've seen before but again
and have high expectations for something
else meteors wants you to be $100 for
and that is that you can set them up
using the free downloadable app how many
times have we heard that before a free
downloadable app you have got to be
kidding me
so you can use the free downloadable app
to set them up in stereo mode that
they're claiming actually sounds pretty
darn good so we're going to set that up
and we'll be back in just a moment
oh yeah hidden away in the little
compartment here is a microUSB cable
that you can use to charge it but they
do not include an AC adapter so you're
gonna have to already have one or a
computer or something in order to charge
it so why don't I just give you guys
some idea of what to expect in terms of
volume with one of my favorite all-time
songs so this is at about 70% this is
where my mic is so that should give you
some idea when I'm talking like pretty
loud it's about like someone kind of
yelling at you now let's crank it up if
you want oh no you probably pretty much
can't hear me over it which should give
you some idea how much volume we're
talking here they are extremely loud we
definitely give the edge to them in
terms of that and there is a fair amount
of bass the only issue that I have with
them in terms of the bass is that it can
tend to overpower the mids a little bit
and it does make the vocal sound a
little bit muddy but with that said if
the intention is to grab one of these or
a couple of them and take them with the
to the beach with you and create as much
sound as possible with as little actual
space taken up as possible these might
be pretty much the way to go so let's go
back to the app for a minute here here
we go
mini boom and let's go to high yes the
the settings so I was going to show you
this to you guys before shows you the
battery life you can set up the speaker
name EQ settings out loud is the loudest
vocals personally I didn't like that
much but intimate actually is probably
the best balanced one in terms of how it
sounds to me you can set up alerts
sounds don't forget yes you can use the
speakerphone and all that good stuff but
I yes this is where things start to get
interesting double up mode so you press
the Bluetooth button twice on another
one after you click start here we go and
you can either run them in stereo or
just run the same sounds off both of
them there we go
in order to just get more sound and it
gets pretty darn loud
so distortion wise there's actually not
much even at maximum volume which is
quite impressive if we had Awards around
here we'd go ahead and probably give
these an editor's choice of some sort
because they sound pretty good they get
extremely loud as advertised and the app
actually just works it was it was
flawless even while music is still
playing we can switch between double-up
mode single mode stereo mode without any
difficulty I don't know if stereo mode
is what I would really use it for I
think it's more like stack them up
double them up get more sound out of it
and get an extremely pleasing and a
crowd pleasing experience out of a very
small form-factor
before we were so rudely interrupted I
was going to tell you to like the video
if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment if your
feelings were much more complicated than
what can be expressed with a simple
thumbs up and thumbs down and don't
