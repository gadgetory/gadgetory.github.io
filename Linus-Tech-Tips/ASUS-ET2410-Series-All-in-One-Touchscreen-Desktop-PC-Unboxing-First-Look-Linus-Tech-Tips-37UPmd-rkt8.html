masseuse it is the ground box actually
this is an eco box which is why it's
brown it contains 80 percent
post-consumer materials and 100%
recyclable cardboard which actually this
is an important distinction because lots
of things say made from recyclable or
recycled materials but actually aren't
made of very much recycled materials so
this is the et 2410 which is part of a
new series of all-in-one PCs from Asus
some of the highlights are going to be
the overall build quality which
obviously I haven't opened it yet but
based on a Seuss's materials they're
saying it's pretty darn fine need metal
stand which is part of the build quality
discussion the updated specs so these
are next generation or second generation
Sandy Bridge processor parts and the
slick design all the units themselves
now the one I have today is the EG 24 10
which is the 24 inch actually I'll just
show you this slide because you guys
might benefit from it so there's also
the 80/20 700 series which is 27-inch
includes dedicated NVIDIA GTX graphics
it has a blu-ray combo Drive and
10-point multi-touch okay the 2400 is
multi-touch and has this one hold on let
me just check the spec of our unit
anyway it's a higher spec than the 22
inch model which is the most value
oriented option out of the ones
available so here let's have a look at
the spec of our unit so this is a core
i5 2310 so this is the higher-end one it
has Windows 7 home premium 6 gigs of ram
a 1 terabyte drive wireless end with
bluetooth and it is a 23 point 6 inch
touch screen as I mentioned before it
uses the integrated Intel graphics which
isn't necessarily a bad thing because
Intel graphics ever since they released
Sandy Bridge aren't nearly as
much of a bottleneck as they used to be
all right so when we have a look at the
Gooden accessories first before we take
a closer look at the all-in-one so here
we go
included accessories we have a wireless
mouse all right thanks for that isus
about kind of a rubberized grip you feel
to it but on there we have a monstrous
power brick remember this is not
intended to be like super portable so
it's fine that it's a little on the
heavy side there for size comparison is
the iPhone 4 there you go guys all right
next we have a power cable which plugs
into that power brick I'll get that out
and that's it for the things in here
kind of a neat shaped box yeah she has
kind of a shape to it and finally I
think this is a keyboard yeah we got a
keyboard as well as a dongle which is
for something oh you know what is
probably for the mouse and keyboard and
batteries for the mouse and keyboard so
here let's have a quick look at the
keyboard itself Wow quite heavy actually
it doesn't feel like those uh sort of
more less expensively manufactured ones
that often come with these all-in-one
type units it's got a little bit of flex
to it but the overall feel is quite nice
it's got some weight to it which is nice
to see it's a chiclet style keyboard
nothing nothing particularly a you know
outrageous to do with the layout here so
it's got a nice long shift key let's go
out a full length tab full length
backspace and full length enter so
that's really good to see because it
means that you will be able to reach all
of the keys the way that you normally
used to we got a warranty card included
alright and then next we have a Quick
Start Guide which is right here and
seems to be fairly straightforward in
terms of the steps included adjust the
angle plug in the thing push the thing
plug in that thing
find those things to that thing and
you're ready to go all right give me a
sec to get this on pass and then we'll
have a look at the unit so here we are
experiencing the
process it actually comes with a variety
of different languages that you can
choose including Deutsch italiano
francais Espanola okay I have no idea
okay Portuguese and the other Dutch
Dutch I guess that must be Dutch okay so
we are in Kannada and thinking up the
keyboard in the mouse was actually very
very straightforward we use the United
States Oh time and courtesy whoops
no no English English Canada you want
middle US there we go
okay so once we're booted up oh I'll get
this going here here we are in the setup
process and you want to go ahead and
accept the license terms which are
required to use windows and this one I'm
not so sure about but apparently the
Bing bar I am required to accept that
license in order to keep going here so I
actually hold on let's see will it let
me go no I have to I have to install the
Bing bar in order to get move it up here
so I'm going to just hold on to my cheat
sheet here because that makes life a
little bit easier for me so let's have a
look at some of the design features that
the et 2410 features so first thing
let's have a look at the overall
thickness so the thickness is actually
six centimeters so what's that 60
millimeters not bad at all actually here
is an iPhone this is camera man's iPhone
you can tell cuz my wicked carbon fiber
sticker isn't on the back okay so there
you go that's the overall thickness of
the unit and then the size this is a
twenty three point six inch 1080p LED
backlit widescreen so I'm just going to
show you guys sort of the approximate
size against the iPhone which maybe
isn't that useful I think everyone knows
how big a twenty 24 inch class monitor
is at this point in time okay so let's
go ahead and move around to let's do the
back first well it goes ahead and
installs drivers for me so there's a
couple different things here first
there's the metal stand so the metal
stand allows you to position it on the
table where do you so desire okay it's
got rubber feet on the bottom so it's
not going to move it's actually fairly
hard to to rock back and forth so it's
not going to go anywhere and then you
can also adjust the tilt of the monitor
or the all-in-one I guess I shouldn't
say
monitor because it is an all-in-one and
it is a monitor but more on that later
all the way from pointing a little bit
face down to all the way back up like
this so if you're actually sitting quite
a bit above it like on a barstool
you'll still be fairly comfortable using
it so it's got a pretty good angle
overall there okay in terms of input and
output options let's start on the side
here this looks like an optical drive
but BAM it's not an optical drive it's
delft inputs and outputs rather well
both okay so we've got two super speed
USB 3 ports an eSATA port an SD slot
headphones and microphone jacks all on
the side of the unit for ease of access
now around the back for more of your
permanent fixtures we've got an
additional three USB ports one of which
we're using right now for the dongle for
the included wireless keyboard and mouse
we've got Gigabit Ethernet now this is
cool check this out HDMI out which is
great if you wanted to add a second
monitor HDMI and VGA in which is pretty
darn cool
if say for example okay here here's a
usage scenario for this you know I'm
going to come up with two right off the
top of my head here one is let's say you
have a boardroom like we do at NCI X and
you don't have a projector in your
boardroom like we don't at NCI X and you
use an all-in-one PC because it's very
convenient with the touch screen and all
that like we have at NCI X let's say
someone brought a laptop and they wanted
to do a presentation instead of
unplugging your all-in-one and moving it
and rearranging everything what you
could actually do is you could just plug
it right into the HDMI or the VGA in on
your all-in-one PC in your boardroom and
you could display an output from the
from the laptop easy awesome and here's
another scenario let's say your
all-in-one PC is outdated we're talking
like three four or five years from now
you know what you need to do the latest
things with your computer it's not fast
enough anymore that's cool it doesn't
matter that it's not upgradeable this
has always been a beef of mine with
all-in-one PCs is that you can't upgrade
them well now at least it's not a throw
away now it can still be a monitor and
you have that additional computer
functionality should you so require it
maybe you have the computer on at all
times for something else maybe now it's
a it's like a dedicated download box or
something like that but you can
is the monitor for a higher powered PC
right here is a cable management spot
which the cameraman evidently missed
when he was plugging in the power and
finally we have a Kensington lock right
about here and I think that pretty much
does it for the back so let's move
around to the other side I'm just gonna
go ahead and turn it all the way around
for you guys here and ah
there we go I don't think this is going
up yeah it did work okay there you have
it so that's a DVD multi multi reader
writer CD also multi reader writer the
higher-end model comes with blu-ray but
this particular one does not and then
finally let's have a look at the front
so on the front we have our microphone
in we've got our webcam we have as I
mentioned before a 1080p LED backlit
screen which is multi-touch and has no
flex to it this is critical because
instead of using a flimsy plastic layer
that has that ripple effect and just is
generally not very desirable we've got a
nice solid feeling display surface that
has no no ripple that you can see on
flat backgrounds and just looks great
and when you press on it you actually
don't see any discoloration of the
screen around your finger which is
really nice as well because I hate that
about some multis some touchscreens when
you touch them and they just go all
discolored and look and look horrible
so let's go around to the bottom of it
here if you just want to come down here
check out the bottom you've got our
power button here our hard drive
indicator we have a volume control here
a menu button volume other more
different control here and a mode button
give me two seconds here guys so we're
booted up into Windows now I'm going
ahead and restarting okay the program
that's not allowing us to restart is one
that was going to automatically restart
it in 20 seconds so I'm not too worried
about that along the bottom bar here we
have our power button we also have our
own I already said that we have a
speaker bar along the very very bottom
with our Seuss logo here and we also
have a Windows 7 sticker core i5 Energy
Star and DTS surround sensation Ultra PC
so let me just see if I'm missing
anything you know what to have a look at
cooling so the exhaust fan is actually
coming out of here you can see a long
heat pipe that goes through very wide it
actually goes from here to here
thin array that is going to be cooling
the CPU which if you guys remember is
also the GPU and let me just see if
there's anything that I am missing here
okay I already mentioned it is a
multi-touch I already mentioned it
doubles as a monitor oh yeah it has
well-known capability so if you pull
this guy off you can actually buy a wall
mount from a soos and you can use it as
a pio pio for example so that's kind of
neat as well last but not least cool
comes with ASUS WebStorage as well
that's actually something that they're
bundling in with a few of their products
these days including the e Pad
Transformer so there's something that I
have missed before and okay let's just
take it in then go ahead and go around
to the other side we've actually finally
got it booted up fully here and running
in the proper resolution so do I want to
use the SU screensaver not particularly
oh yeah I really like the screen
actually this is pretty good so let's go
ahead and launch you paint here you know
what I really want to do is I want to
set up the windows 8 preview on this
thing so that we can really check out
how a proper properly touchscreen
optimized OS is going to run on a
machine like this 800 K I'm clearly
doing it wrong excuse that that drug
mean whoo oh that's very responsive
actually but that I wonder how many how
many multi touches do we get oh I think
this app only supports single touch
let's see yeah single touch for this
particular application but it's very
very responsive very very smooth you can
see how long it takes to trace after me
that's not bad at all
so very compelling looking little setup
- very clean because it comes with all
the wireless peripherals that you're
going to need and I think that pretty
much covers everything I wanted to say
for now until we do a full NCIX tech
