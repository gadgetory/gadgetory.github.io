on my wrist recently and it's true I got
so frustrated with androids craptastic
power management for background tasks
that when I reformatted my Android daily
driver galaxy s7 and started carrying
the iPhone 7 as a stopgap solution along
with a lightning - three and a half
millimeter adapter I never went back but
the iPhone is far from flawless assure
symmetry is beauty but the ergonomics
leave a lot to be desired and iOS works
damn well these days even for heavy
Google service users like me but it
still has redonkulous limitations like
not being able to move icons around it
will so then will the Galaxy s8 be
enough to bring me back let's find out
HP's new omen X lineup comes equipped
with Intel 7th generation Core i7
processor check it out at the link in
the video description meet the Galaxy s8
samsung may have lacked the courage to
remove the three-and-a-half millimeter
jack but other than that it's got almost
everything you'd expect from a 2017
flagship with top-of-the-line specs and
modern features like USB type-c wireless
charging and ip68 water resistance this
is indisputably the finest design work
ever
from Samsung's mobile division and I
remember like it was yesterday being
blown away by the quantum leap forward
that they took with the s6 edge but that
was nothing compared to this I already
liked the curved front and rear glass
from the note 7 so I was amped to see
that return but when I first heard about
some of the other changes like the
taller than usual 18 and a half by 9
aspect ratio and the decision to remove
the hardware home-button that's been a
galaxy staple since they first blatantly
ripped off the iPhone 7 years ago I was
pretty skeptical but what Samsung has
done here is amazing for reasons that
probably aren't immediately apparent
let's get back to the hole ripping off
the iPhone conversation whether they
actually did that all those years ago
and to what degree still hasn't been
resolved but that's what's different
with this phone no objective person can
make that argument today both of the s8
and si+ are significant steps forward
from an aging iPhone design that's been
with us for nearly three years now
the curved front and rear shape that
made the note 7 the most holdable
phablet ever work just as well on the
SAT plus and then even better on a line
of size device like the s8 and this
together with the Titan
integration of biometric authentication
has managed to change long time phone
use habits of mine in a matter of hours
an impressive feat first is the way I
access apps I've dismissed Samsung's
previous efforts to make the curved
screen useful as contrived but as
someone with only a handful of
frequently used apps and basically no
friends I can now do over 90% of what I
would do on my phone including capturing
screenshots with a simple swipe from the
right second is the way I unlock my
phone I don't recommend Samsung's a
facial method could get a little messy
for you if someone uses a picture to
unlock your phone but there's lots of
other options and between Google's own
smart locking based on location and
sensor data Samsung's retina unlock that
picks me up a good 60 plus percent of
the time during normal use and the rear
fingerprint sensor it's finally gotten
to the point where nobody else can pick
up my device and just start using it but
for me I'm not thinking about security
while I try to use it which is the holy
grail of biometric security though with
that said I still would have very much
preferred the rumored fingerprint sensor
under the on screen home button which
leads us then into big change number
three the way I interact with the
phone's home back and multitasking
buttons which by the way can be
rearranged if you want now yes I never
missed my precious dedicated buttons
once
unlike other Android phones that require
an extra press to unhide the buttons
that then cover up valuable vertical
scrolling real estate or whatever
content it is you're trying to enjoy
Samsung's unique aspect ratio leaves
enough room that it never feels like
they're in the way and even when they're
hidden you can still access the home
button with a hard press from anywhere
it is so intuitive which isn't to say
that
there's nothing about the s8 that falls
behind the iPhone Apple's 3d touch
pressure-sensitive screen is just so
much better
aside from the obvious it covers the
whole screen aspect the quality of the
haptic feedback is an area that Samsung
could definitely stand to improve and
while I'm whining now that Apple's fixed
it that single bottom speaker without
stereo backup from the earpiece speaker
that's already there just use it please
is so 2015 and furthermore while the
2960 by 1440 AMOLED display has
impressive specs like HDR support even
with video enhancement off and the
cinema profile selected it still cranks
color saturation in a way that might
appeal to average consumers but that
looks very unnatural next to the iPhone
the non-existent improvements to the
camera are a sore spot for some people
but honestly for me I'm not that
surprised that in spite of this sensor
hardware change not much has been done
to image quality or features here if you
were happy with the lightning fast if
slightly processing heavy rear camera
and wide-angle selfie lens from before
then you'll be happy with them on the s8
and if you weren't then man come on it
must be hard being so damn difficult to
please do you have any idea how hard it
is to build a 4k video camera that's
smaller than your fingernail sorry oops
I actually didn't mean to put that right
over top of the sensor I was trying to
unlock the phone or maybe I was trying
to touch the heart rate sensor okay so
that is one fair complaint to Samsung's
credit the oleophobic coating on the
camera glass is really good but you will
end up with janky pictures from time to
time due to the unfortunate placement of
those sensors on either side
let's talk software now the new get
flavor of TouchWiz or is it
Samsung experienced whatever they're
calling it is still a mixed bag it's
lighter and
higher performance than ever with some
fantastic new innovations to app and
icon management better multitasking a
gorgeous new theme that makes the screen
feel even more spacious than it is a
crop mode for the extra wide screen that
already works on YouTube and enough
great little customizations that I
honestly think Apple finally has to
respond with some customizations of
their own in the next version of iOS
there is some bullcrap though that thing
where it installs bloatware and locks to
the first carrier sim you insert well
that's back for another round of me
hating it the always-on display is in my
mind pretty useless without a more
detailed preview like what Motorola does
when you press on the notifications
swiping up and swiping down from
anywhere bringing up the app tray feels
like a waste of a gesture to me down
should bring down your notifications the
ambient light sensor algorithm needs
some serious work it was all over the
place in my use and the mobile hotspot
button has been removed as an option
from the quick settings for some reason
that is as inexplicable as it is
infuriating to me furthermore Samsung's
decision to disallow remapping of the
bixby button is a purely stubborn move
that I hope they reversed sooner rather
than later without being offensive I
hope I feel a little bad for people
whose lives are so predictable that
their digital assistant manages to do
anything more useful than pop up a card
from time to time with some recent news
I don't personally care about digital
assistants beyond setting a reminder or
an alarm and neither do a lot of people
and if I did I would just long press the
home button and use Google's so final
answer time will I switch this phone's
overall usability is wonderful almost
every objection like the way that the
bezel is design makes edge
a little more difficult to reach while
typing can be overcome with a pretty
simple habit change but my main issue
with Android battery management remains
I mean look at this random notification
that popped up informing me that Gmail
was sucking back battery what I even
went out of my way on this phone to only
sync up two of my Google accounts a
pretty typical load out rather than the
five plus that are required to manage
all of our YouTube channels and making
matters worse than that when I go to
investigate further all I get is a black
hole
what kind of broken math is this then
the next day having changed nothing
about the way I'm using the phone I've
got 30% left at the end of the day with
a more normal battery life decreasing
curve here but equally opaque numbers
how is this not fixed by now yes there
are power saving modes but you know what
kind of a solution that is that's
designing a crummy antenna and telling
your users they're holding the phone
wrong I understand that Google and
Samsung can't control the entire app
ecosystem but at the very least what I'm
asking for is functioning tools so I can
diagnose the issue myself so then yes I
am switching to it it's really gorgeous
but the first time this is the hottest
thing in my pants when my wife walks
into the room I'm going back to the
iPhone well how'd I get over here I
guess I must be filming an ad pickup for
you guessed it be brand the brand is the
place to go if you want a wicked awesome
looking vinyl skin that fits your device
and just plain feels great they use
high-quality authentic true textured 3m
vinyl on every product they've got
unrivaled precision they ship worldwide
on the cheap and if you guys were
impressed by the Dragon Skin skin that I
had on this phone during this video
you're not the only one this
has got to be their best skin yet it
looks fantastic I don't know what it is
is it scales is it burnt wood is it
freaking it doesn't matter
it looks fantastic and dramatically
improves the grip enos of the phone at
the same time so check it out at the
link in the video description you can
use their configurator to see exactly
what your device will look like before
you buy and I guess I've really run out
of talking points here they're nice
people or robots as it were so thanks
for watching guys if you dislike this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit the like button get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured at
the link in the video description also
down there is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum where you can join up
and talk tech it's a pretty cool place
to hang out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
