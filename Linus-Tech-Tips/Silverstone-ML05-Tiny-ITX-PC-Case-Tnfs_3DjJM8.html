companies for me a lot of the time I
look at their products I go wow this is
really well designed and the build
quality is fantastic but who the heck
would want one and that's what the mlo 5
was to me at only 7 liters of internal
volume it's one of the smallest cases on
the market but when they send me the
sample I just couldn't figure out who
they were targeting with it the CM storm
SF 17 uses a massive 18 centimeter fan
to cool your gaming notebook and it adds
a four port USB hub click now to learn
more starting with the outside the front
of the case adopts a look that's a
little bit different from the
traditional Silverstone style subtle
things like opting for diamond-shaped
power and reset buttons but it retains
the classy look that I've come to expect
from them you'll find a Silverstone logo
and a slimline optical loading slot and
that's about it on the right hand side
were greeted by front USB 3 and audio as
well as 280 millimeter fan mounts that I
would recommend populating and using as
intakes especially if you have a three
and a half inch hard drive installed I
wish they were filtered but I guess I
could buy something or DIY something
with black panty hose if I really wanted
the left side is blank and then moving
around to a wide shot of the back we get
the first hints about the internal
layout the MMO v uses an SFX power
supply and MITx motherboard with a
half-height expansion card slot and adds
a full sized horizontal PCI slot that I
wish was oriented the other way to allow
a PCIe extension cable to be used more
easily if I wanted to install a
full-height card with decent ventilation
out the top here as it is it could be
used for add-ons like a PCI slot mounted
fan controller for example though
interestingly other than about an inch
on the left of the motherboard here
which we need for those optional 180
millimeter fans there is almost no gap
from component to component across the
back it is amazing how little space has
been wasted in every dimension on this
case on the bottom we find 4 rubber feet
that silverstone makes you apply
yourself which i thought was a bit janky
but at least there
nice and grippy so the case won't go
anywhere obviously this doesn't prove
anything because I have a tablecloth on
the table but whatever you get the point
the top panel has ventilation holes for
the optional 120 millimeter fan that can
go on the four in one mounting plate as
well as another set of holes for the
power supply to draw in fresh hair and
it's removed with three screws at the
back which whoa that is one cramped
interior now this is a fairly simple PC
no graphics card or anything but frankly
it was still pretty challenging to build
in just because the inside of this case
is so tight we'll start with the power
supply I went with Silverstone's
80 plus gold 450 watt modular unit but I
think to do it over again I would have
actually gone with a non modular power
supply because the clearance between the
modular cables and the Qualla two and a
half inch drive cage here is really
really tight and I was barely able to
get the Cajon
a nice touch is the stamped instructions
for which way connectors go on the cage
so at least you won't have to do it
twice when you realize everything's
oriented the wrong way and actually for
that matter the way that they key the
cross brace so that it only goes in one
way is another nice touch as well as
little things like this that make a
builder's life less frustrating speaking
of frustrating you would have to be some
kind of a wizard to actually get four
SSDs in their data is okay especially if
you use thin wire low profile cables
like silverstone CP 11s but unless
you're using a custom power splitter it
just doesn't seem realistic to get all
four of those drives power it up moving
over we could see that while there is a
PCI slot here in the back and you could
move the cables out of the way enough to
get at it there's almost no room for
cooling as it is and that would make
things even more cramped I can't think
of too many half-height cards that I
would recommend installing in this case
but I guess at least you have the option
which leads us to the next thing I
wouldn't recommend installing the four
in one plate here can accept a 120
millimeter fan two two and a half inch
drives a slimline optical or what we
have in here a three and a half inch
drive and while the first three options
are just fine in
how tight that three and a half inch
drive is in here I just don't think I
can recommend going that route I'm using
a very low-profile CPU cooler and while
low temperatures are still you know not
like t-junction on my core i5 3450 I
don't like the close proximity of the
hard drive of the CPU which combined are
going to be generating most of the heat
that's being kicked out into the case as
far as final thoughts go the manual is
excellent as always and doubles as a
build guide and the case construction is
very very solid there's almost no flex
to it and thick metal everywhere that
makes the finished product feel more
like a piece of equipment versus a PC
but the finishing touches are not quite
up to the same standard that I expect
from silvers timing it's just little
things like the inclusion of silver
screws instead of black ones on the
outside and the fact that it comes no no
wha no thumb screws instead of you know
regular screwdriver screws on the back
it only comes with two zip ties I mean
it's not like there's much room for
cable management inside anyway and these
are very minor complaints especially
when you consider the price it's just
that I have very high expectations for
silverstone so I felt like I had to say
those things so now that the build is
done who is it for could I figure it out
I mean with chromecast available for 35
bucks is there still room for HT pcs I
use one and the functionality is better
but I don't pay for most of my computer
hardware and I doubt I'd be willing to
spend the money on a high-end machine
like this if I did I guess the best use
I can think for it would be as a steamos
gaming machine when Intel drops another
generational improvement or two on us in
terms of onboard graphics performance or
as an in-home streaming box using steam
and playing games right now Intel's
latest CPUs have great hardware h.264
decoders and with a separate powerful
rig elsewhere in the house you can
actually get a great gaming experience
on your TV even without a powerful media
center PC the 6-2 and a half inch drive
compatibility is a weird one to me while
we're talking about conclusions I mean I
guess the pitch is that you could store
your content
and locally by loading it up with two to
half-inch hard drives or something
that's not something I'd recommend and
honestly what I'd probably do is just
take this cage out jam and SSD into that
corner and make your life a little bit
easier cable management wise that way so
advertised specs aside the case is so
amazingly small that you need to have
reasonable expectations about what you
can build in here if you're ready to use
an ass to expand its storage over the
network and use a separate gaming rig to
give it the horses it needs to play
modern games using steam in-home
streaming then I think you'll be very
happy with your sexy new HTPC if you
want a little bit more power in the box
itself will obviously silverstone has a
wide variety of other cases that are
much much larger that will allow you to
achieve that
