at something that we've kind of looked
at before but not quite this is the
Western Digital my book velociraptor duo
so we've already had a look at their
other jewel drive thunderbolt enclosure
which actually had green drives inside
which means you've got bigger capacity
so that one was a 4 terabyte model
whereas this one is only 2 terabytes of
total capacity but the big difference is
this one instead of those screen drives
which spin it around 5400 rpm has two
drives that's been a green 10,000 rpm so
we're gonna have more performance faster
response times and lower capacity but
more performance and faster response
times which is what Thunderbolt is all
about so let's see what WD I've already
done my spiel but let's see what they
think
dramatic performance data protection and
daisy chain flexibility cool two
terabytes or up to two terabytes
depending on how you configure it - WD
Velociraptor 10,000 rpm drives inside
compatible with OS X 10 whatever you
want to call it okay we're gonna look at
that when we open it up blazing speed
from WD Velociraptor 10,000 RPM
evolutionary Thunderbolt interface okay
so we pretty much covered this so let's
open it up and have a look at what this
one looks like compared to the other one
that we did already unbox and I am
expecting it to look very similar so we
have a power brick we have really it
includes a Thunderbolt cable button not
wait yeah it includes a Thunderbolt
cable that's awesome
way to go WD for like banning up and
including the cable with these expensive
Thunderbolt products love it good show
okay moving right along
oh it says that right on the box had I
not gone through the box so quickly I
might have noticed that it says
Thunderbolt cable included and contents
Thunderbolt cable but I like surprises
that's half the fun of this unboxing
channel like the surprise of not reading
the box and then being surprised by
things that shouldn't surprise us you
know what we should do just for giggle
since I might not actually open the
enclosure is uh we should go be
surprised that we have a Western Digital
velociraptor so this is our Velociraptor
let's just see if our Velociraptor it's
the same as their Velociraptor but let's
take a look at the at the enclosure
first so it's about the size of two
three and a half inch drives if you guys
aren't sure of the scale and I would
also love to do the traditional iPhone
size comparison I know it's been a while
since I've pulled this out there you go
iPhone size comparison so now y'all will
know how big it is lots of cooling you
can see here there's passive ventilation
going on in the bottom passive
ventilation going on in the top heat
does naturally rise so you'll get cool
air because these feet are so tall
coming in through through the bottom of
the enclosure and then up through the
top I wouldn't recommend running this on
a soft surface such as like on your bed
next to your laptop although usually
that probably wouldn't come up but I
would recommend putting you down on a
hard surface okay at the back of over
indicator LED there hiding probably
can't even see that on the camera don't
worry about it
on the back you've got your power in
your Kensington lock because this baby
is valuable you're gonna want to lock
that up if you're using it in public
there's a store demo you know know
there's a valid reason for this to
Thunderbolt ports so these are pass
throughs which means you can daisy chain
up to six of these which would be just
Oh way to ballin out so that would be
six times two terabytes potentially with
the whole thing running in raid zero off
to ten gigabit per section but you know
I wonder if I could do something to you
to send me ten an hour six of these
probably not okay let's have a look at
the drives inside so I'm expecting needs
to be regular Velociraptor drives seem
able to look at though that will
open it so this is a two-and-a-half-inch
drive however it is a thicker
form-factor drive and it comes with a
huge heatsink that allows it to stay
cool and and and perform you know like
it's 10,000 revolutions per minute that
it that it does and here we go
hey so only use WD blossom after rajma
the other one of those labeled only use
green drives I don't know if this is for
more locked or anything like that but
it's clearly nothing to do with the
actual cooling capacity of the unit
because they've taken their lowest power
coolest running drives and their highest
power hottest running drives and they
put them both in this enclosure so maybe
I'm overthinking this but yes it just
has this handy-dandy pull tab and other
than that it looks the same as our
Velociraptor down to the same part
number two one terabyte velociraptors
and now they're like now they're like
dual Raptors thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look at the WD my
book Velociraptor do remember this is
all about more performance and faster
response times this is a
professional-grade product so if you
were doing for example video editing
then you might want something like this
because it will be something that you
can portably take with you with your
footage you'll get again the response
time that you get from the faster rpm
drives and the capacity that you need
that's not all these on for example many
modern notebooks that are equipped with
Thunderbolt so you can get that storage
in the speed and them I think I've
repeated myself a few times so let's
just finish up with um I don't know
