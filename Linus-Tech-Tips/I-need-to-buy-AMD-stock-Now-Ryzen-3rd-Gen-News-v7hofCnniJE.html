which must mean bad news for Intel the
big thing this year at Computex is AMD
not necessarily even the products
themselves they're important and we are
going to talk about them in a moment
here but it's more about the dramatic
change that's unfolding in the computer
industry as we speak so two years ago
almost to the day
AMD surprise launched their risin thread
Ripper workstation CPU lineup now thread
Ripper was only a niche product and one
that Intel could counter by tacking
overclocking features onto neutered
server chips that they were already
working on but it still put team glue on
their heels this year forget about heels
in 2019 AMD is putting Intel Street on
their ass with direct attacks on nearly
every single segment of Intel CPU
business data center and supercomputing
mainstream consumer and even the
previously unthinkable mobile Xen - epic
and risin are a really really big deal
so that leaves us talking about the very
real possibility that your next high-end
computer whether you're assisted min at
a data center or a gamer at home is
going to be a red one now I can't
comment on any of the demos that took
place after the keynote because I ran
out immediately to film this video but
what I can do is combine my thoughts on
the keynote with everything that I've
learned while poking around Taipei over
the last couple of days the main news
for you guys
has got to be the launch of X 5:17 a.m.
these new mainstream motherboard chipset
that leapfrogs Intel and technology
features for the first time since I
don't know 2003 I guess that's not
normal and neither is the amount of
support that AMD is getting for it
so let's talk about that first without
even having any performance numbers or
pricing you can usually make a pretty
educated guess as to how strong a new
CPU lineup is going to be simply by
looking at the amount of investment that
a chip maker is getting from their
partners I mean think about it no one is
going to spend the R&amp;amp;D time and money
that's required to create a top-tier
overclocking gaming motherboard for an
overpriced CPU with crummy performance
and likewise no one builds out an
enormous line-up of motherboards a seuss
alone announced Ferdie unless the CPUs
that go in them are expected to sell
like Bob's your uncle
so all of this stuff comes from the
stage demos which have to be taken with
at least a small grain of salt until we
get the products in our hands but it
looks like right now AMD is bringing the
fight to Intel in terms of not just
multi-threading performance something
we've gotten used to over the last
couple of years but even single threaded
and gaming performance with their top
tier rise in 9:12 core managing a boost
clock of 4.6 gigahertz with an announced
15% improvement in per clock performance
over last gen so what that means in
summary is that barring something
totally unforeseen within a couple of
months AMD will be matching or even
measurably out performing Intel and I
don't mean with an asterisk at a given
budget I'm talking outright so imma let
that sink in for a minute and the good
news for fans of innovation in the PC
space just keeps on coming one of the
other big headlines for this launch is
PCI Express gen for the next iteration
of the high speed interconnect that we
use for everything from graphics cards
to network cards to even storage these
days
PCI Express Gen 4 is double the speed of
its predecessor so that means that the
40 total PCI Express Lanes 20 from the
chip four of which linked to the chipset
and then 20 branching off from there can
provide up to double the available
bandwidth of last Gen 4 supported
devices while still maintaining support
for legacy ones and the crazy thing this
caught me totally off guard is that
there are going to be devices to plug
into it basically right away AMD
announced their own PCI Express Gen 4
GPUs based on their new Navi
architecture on stage and then right
after the keynote my inbox lit up
immediately with an announcement from
Corsair for an MDOT - SSD that reaches
nearly five gigabit per second data
transfer speeds thanks to its use of PCI
Express Gen 4 now this next-gen
interconnects does come with a cost
every single X 570 motherboard that
we've seen even a Seuss's crosshair
formula which has water cooling onboard
for the V RMS has a fan to actively cool
the chipset heatsink word on the street
is that the reason for that is that this
chip can suck as much as 11 watt like
think about that that is dangerously
close to the 15 watts of Intel's u
series mobile CPUs now on the subject of
pulling lots of power the most reliable
rumors indicate that in addition to the
6 8 and 12 core products that they
announced today AMD's third gen Rison
line-up will have 16 core products at
some point which means that motherboard
compatibility is going to get even more
complicated than we already thought it
would now back when Rison first launched
AMD committed to longer life spans for
that socket so you'd be able to take
your existing a m4 motherboard and
upgrade it with new cpus for a long time
but then the thing is they went and
surprised their partners by cranking up
the number of cores on their CPUs in
just a couple of years so that means
that the first gen boards were simply
not designed to handle the power draw or
in some cases even the required firmware
of these new chips so we talked to MSI
and they are not supporting third gen
Rison on 1st gen boards they're advising
against using 2nd gen boards with third
gen Rison and even on their 3rd gen
boards they're recommending using some
common sense when creating your pairing
so they were only really comfortable
recommending their top-end boards which
can comfortably deliver 300 watts or
more to the CPU socket if you're going
to be overclocking the upcoming 16 Corp
a seuss by contrast was a little more
bullish saying that literally everything
in their lineup will handle up to a 16
core or frankly even more they felt like
they learned a big lesson last time
around when AMD blindsided them with
much more power hungry chips and they
don't want to get put in a position
where they can't support a new chip
because the motherboard hardware just
wasn't built for it honestly though
that's not even a sis's biggest feature
the main benefit of their higher-end
boards so any of the full sized rog
boards is apparently a new hardware
tweak that they found that they promise
will improve memory overclocking margins
quite considerably and this could be an
absolutely huge deal like a game changer
for asus because AMD processors are so
dependent on memory frequency to perform
their best so I am really looking
forward to testing to see if this
Hardware tweak actually makes a
difference
though come to think of it I'm having a
hard time coming up with anything about
this entire situation that I'm not
looking forward to thing is like nothing
against Intel they're a great partner
and they make great products but until
AMD gave them a kick in the shorts it
had been a long while since they excited
me as an enthusiast and as a consumer
and now with this announcement they are
getting a good and proper wake-up call
here because this will impact their
sales and their bottom line over not
just the next couple of quarters but
even the next couple of years the
craziest part is that up until now I've
only talked about the DIY and enthusiast
stuff I haven't even touched on amd64
core refresh to their ethic data center
platform and the stunning number of
design wins that they were showing off
in pre-built desktops and mobile
especially gaming notebooks like these
are big markets that make up a
significant chunk of Intel's portfolio
you can tell the news is getting really
bad because it's finally starting to
rain so that's where the prospect of AMD
stock starts to look appealing now to be
clear I am NOT your financial adviser
and I'm not actually planning to buy any
AMD stock because holding PC hardware
stocks would be an enormous conflict of
interest for me it's just that from both
the leaked and the public Intel roadmaps
that I've seen I don't have any reason
to believe that Intel is going to be
able to regain their performance
leadership position until sometime after
2020 and that's an if not a guaranteed
when like it is looking like it's gonna
be a bad couple of years over it Intel
headquarters I mean honestly the only
good news I can find in all of this for
Intel is that if AMD has consumer chips
that dramatically outperform Intel's
then maybe that'll help Intel resolve
all the cpu shortages that they've been
going through since they the
and for them we'll probably start to
drop so silver lining am i right now
AMD could still let me down they've
certainly done it before
and they're probably gonna do it again
but for better or for worse I'm on the
hype train pretty hard this time so all
I can do now is just hope that I don't
end up eating my words because words
aren't delicious not like private
internet access private Internet access
supports a variety of VPN protocols and
types of encryption and authentication
allowing you to dial in exactly the
level of privacy protection that you
need
they've got apps for Windows Mac OS
Android iOS Linux and Google Chrome and
they've got over 3,000 bare-metal
servers in 44 locations across 28
countries with p IA you can connect up
to five devices at the same time with a
single account and their apps include
great features like their dns leak
protection so go check it out use p ia
to hide your true IP address and
geographic location by heading to the

checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link below
sometime in the next couple months
they're not oh yeah also down there's
