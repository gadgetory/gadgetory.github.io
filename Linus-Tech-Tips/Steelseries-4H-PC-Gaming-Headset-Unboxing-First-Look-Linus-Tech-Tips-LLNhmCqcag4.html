relatively low end product from steel
series now we recently had a look at
their 5 hv2
Siberia v2 headsets now this is the
plain old 4 H there's no v2 it is
basically a slightly cut-down version of
their successful 5h product it does come
in a little bit less expensive but it
also doesn't have all of the features of
a 5 H so let's get this out of the box
here it doesn't come in nearly as nice
of a package this thing just kind of
rips apart whereas the 5 inch you can
slide out of the box all nicely and it
comes out all fancy and this one we just
have to kind of like rip it open here in
order to ya know it's a pretty similar
looking set of headphones but you'll see
that there's a couple key feature
differences first of all ok let's get to
the accessories actually let's do that
very first of all so this is actually
taped here ok so we have a steel series
brochure showing you all of their other
products ok that's very nice and you
have a SteelSeries sticker as well as a
warning about not turning up your
headphones too loud ok inside here you
will find the cable that comes attached
to it now here's where we will encounter
the first missing feature the 4-h has
the same mic and headphones all you
can't roll knob that we find on the 5h
series of a metal clip that looks nice
and durable but what's missing is the
shortened cables with extensions so the
4-h is not going to be as easy to plug
into the back of say for example a 7 g
keyboard from SteelSeries because you'll
have to have all of this wire hanging
about now the wire itself is actually
not nearly as long as you can get with
the 5 HIV to either okay so as soon as I
get this detached here doo-doo-doo-doo
I'll be able to pull out the headphones
and have a look at those so the first
thing I notice about them my cat
probably said first thing a few times
now but another thing I noticed about
them that is missing versus the 5 hv 2
is the disassembled headband for lack of
a better
the 5hv 2 comes apart at these two
junctions so you can actually fold up
the whole thing and throw it in your bag
another small difference is the fact
that the cable comes in from either side
which is a little bit more awkward when
you're gaming because it means that I
comes down the middle which can get in
the way of your keyboard or anything
else when you drape it around to the
back of your computer
the 5hb 2 actually comes with one cable
on the side and then it's connected via
the headband now these are quite
comfortable the ear cups are actually
very similar in style to the 5hv 2 and
I'll get the the camera person to have a
look at those they're nice and spongy
and they also fit nice large ears in
there which is pretty good I mean
SteelSeries headsets are all about
comfort so if you're not comfortable
while you're gaming then you're they're
not achieving their goal
ok now they've done something slightly
different at the top there is a little
bit less padding but I do like the way
that it's constructed because you've got
kind of a non-slip material here that
will I mean I shouldn't say stick to
your hair it's not gonna stick to your
hair but what it does is it grips the
headphones in place and makes it hard
for them to slide out of place ok and
the last thing that I should point out
about the 4h is that it has much like
many other SteelSeries headsets a little
retractable mic can the side here and I
love this feature because it makes it so
you can actually use them as headphones
should you desire without looking like a
tool with your mic hanging up the side
of your head so there you have it it's
the flexible little mic that we've come
to know and love from steel series
headsets so thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the steel series 4h
headset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
