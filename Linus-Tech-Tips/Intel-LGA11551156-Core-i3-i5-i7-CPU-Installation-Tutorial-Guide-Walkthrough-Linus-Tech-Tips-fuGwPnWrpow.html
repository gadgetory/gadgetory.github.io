my youtube messages today and they asked
me how to install an LGA 1156 CPU so
that kind of inspired me to do a series
of CPU installation tips so I've got an
Intel confidential CPU I can't tell you
what that is but the first one I'm going
to be doing is how to install a CPU in
an LGA 1156 motherboard so step one
would be fine to CPU okay so as long as
you've completed that the actual first
step would be to take the lever here and
then you push down a little bit pull it
out to the side and then lift it up
actually you don't need to lift much
because it's it's kind of spring-loaded
here so you can see the pressure that
the arm is putting down over here and
that actually forces the socket to slide
under this bolt okay so that's what is
giving the pressure to hold your CPU in
so you pull it out lift up the arm
that's going to cause this sort of yeah
there we go lift up so once that
protective cover is removed you should
remove any cat from the vicinity because
cats will cause all kinds of problems
during CPU installation step two would
be to see that little place where it
says remove remove that so you hold your
thumb under there
lift it up okay so you're removing the
protective cover from the LGA 1156
socket this is the part where it could
get hairy if you have a cat so there's
1156 pins in there all of which need to
make perfect contact with the 1156 pins
on the bottom of your CPU now you see
these two notches up at the top here
right there and then at the bottom right
here those two notches need to line up
with the notches in the socket which are
here and here okay so I got to line up
my CPU which means it's going to go in
some kind of different orientation hold
on put it this way ah this is harder
than it looks folks I'm looking through
the camera installing a CPU so you get
it lined up just right so you can see my
notches are where they belong drop it
into the socket being very careful I
like to give it a little bit of a wiggle
just to make sure it's in the right
then you take the cover here you put it
right where it goes sort of so that it
can slide down here so you just it's
going to be loose that's normal
okay so then you take the lever pull it
all the way down there's going to be
you're applying some pressure here like
that actually is putting a fair amount
of force back on my finger so once you
do that you can see that the CPU is
actually held in by these two tabs right
here more than anything else so those
line up with a little metal tab on the
heat spreader and that's what gives your
CPU of a force downward that it needs to
ensure it makes good contact with the
pads in the socket so thank you for
checking out my installation tip for LGA
1156 more to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
