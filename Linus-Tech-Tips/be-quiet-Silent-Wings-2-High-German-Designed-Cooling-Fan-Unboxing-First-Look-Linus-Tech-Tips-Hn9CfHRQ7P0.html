the be quiet silent wings to no
compromise silence and performance
120-millimeter fend virtually inaudible
at fifteen point seven decibels max okay
super long life fluid dynamic bearing
with copper core good stuff highly
effective air flow which has to do with
the design of the rotors and blades and
all that good stuff noise absorbing anti
vibration concept this I want to check
out three pin connector and flexible
installation options these all sound
like good things virtually inaudible
production no mechanical noise newly
developed by Grisham's workshop
announced okay mineralization of
electronic sound sources due to a high
quality IC motor controller see this
matters this is the kind of stuff that
nobody actually spends money on when
they're manufacturing their fans but it
makes a big difference
three year manufacturer warranty and
lifespan at 25 C of three hundred
thousand hours which by the way is a lot
that's like years like years and years
and they claim it operates at four to 14
volts DC at four volt operation is very
impressive very few fans will start out
at four volts I don't know if it will
start up for a little it's actually but
if it operates at four volts at all
that's still pretty good so the fluid
dynamic bearing with the copper core
improves heat conductivity and reduces
mechanical friction for a higher
lifespan interesting use of high quality
motor controller leads to minimize
organizing electronic noise this is all
the same stuff air flow optimized blades
okay cool beans removable anti vibration
mounting the stuffs on the mounting
options including screwless installation
casing components as well as mounting
with screws okay so you can see it
actually doesn't come with like any way
to mount it see so what you have to do
oh I love these these are the best see
12 volt 5 volt 7 volt all black wires
perfect every fan should include this
although then how would be quiet set
themselves apart from the others well
they'd have to find a new way and that's
how innovation happens kids
all right without some rubber washers
here we've got some plastic pins so I'm
assuming the washers have something to
do with the pins all right and then
these seem to have something to do with
how to actually mount the fan to
something I'm probably going to need a
minute here guys this is actually pretty
cool so you've got a couple of different
options you can see these can be turned
around either way so you would screw a
fan into the hard plastic so that would
be a hard mount and then these other
pieces are for soft mounting so you use
these plastic guides right here you put
a washer on it first okay so that goes
against your case so that there's rubber
isolation between the hard plastic in
your case and then the fan goes where it
goes and you just put this in here and
then the spacing will be just right to
make it so there's not that much room
for the metal and you'll have a nice
soft vibration free mount nice high
quality rubber as well so it's got some
flex to it which is where the anti
vibration properties come from but it's
also not just like cheesy and going to
break as soon as you use it a couple
times which we have run into in the past
with with anti vibration mount for fans
so I think that pretty much covers it
other than just plugging in as I'm just
sort of curious now is it morbid
curiosity for me fans come down to how
much motor noise is there because oh
you can barely hear you can actually
barely hear the motor at all until you
get your ear almost right next to it
very nice hard to hard to subjectively
judge sort of the airflow that it's
pushing but they're quite well regarded
you can see just little things like the
overall quality of the construction even
though there's not much to the outside
rectangular frame it still doesn't flex
very much at all which is which is
outstanding like you look at you look at
cheaper fans like for example actually
these law justice ones are kind of
outstanding in terms of flex but yes the
OEM course are ones the old ones you can
just kind of actually those ones are not
that bad see if I can find one you know
I don't really hold on to the really bad
stuff but you let's have to believe me
an attack fans of geese yeah you guys
always have to trust me on this one oh
no this one there even with this bracket
on it see that flex that's a cheap fan
so there you go that pretty much wraps
it up thank you for checking out my
boxing and first look at the silent
wings to fan from be quiet don't forget
subscribe - tech tips from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos and
also the simply thing on is excellent
and it has a black connector and it will
generally look awesome in your
high-performance machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
