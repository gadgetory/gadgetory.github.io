the answer to that on home pod sorry I'm
not sure about that sorry I can't help
with that yet do you ever find that your
modern conveniences are just not that
convenient well thankfully there's a
better way meet the smart clapper a
smart home device from before smart home
and Internet of Things for the biggest
bullshit buzzwords it requires no
smartphone to operate sets up in less
than 30 seconds and is exactly as
stylish as you'd need something that
sits behind your couch to be remember
zero design budget means more money in
your wallet for avocado toast the smart
clapper is great for home security too
as long as your hands are still free you
can activate it in less than a second
and wired connectivity means it's always
reliable it's so simple a dog can use it
and it even works in a power outage why
would I
so get your smart clapper today for just
$30 or like a lot less if you want to
get a cheap knockoff on eBay in all
seriousness though I still haven't
really bought into the whole smart
lighting thing so in today's video we
are actually going to be comparing a
vintage still in package the smart
clapper against a philips hue system
let's see how they stack up
you're going down private Internet
access is the VPN service that encrypts
all your internet traffic and use a safe
protected IP it's got a ton of other
useful features as well so you can check
it out at the link in the video
description
all right so this video wouldn't be
complete without an unboxing of the
smart clapper this is fantastic I
actually don't think this is the
original smart clapper but based on how
old everything about this packaging is
from its two color print so you can see
they couldn't afford more than blue oh
no wait no they've actually got some
some different hues they've got some red
pink purple blue okay so it's got color
maybe it's just that it's faded so
between the cheap looking packaging the
like old crappy looking logos like that
has got to be like vintage 80s and oh
the legitimately yellow plastic oh wow
you can see it gets a lot of its color
back so what is this thing the sound
activated on/off switch that's smart
enough to control two different
appliances at the same time yes my
friends this is the smart appliance that
predates smart home instructions and
warranty if you're honestly stupid
enough that you can't operate a clapper
then you should probably just not have
electricity
oh no way it doesn't have a ground plug
oh that's kind of lame but it does have
a home-and-away dial and that is not a
binary dial that is a spectral dial so
you can be like a little bit home or
mostly away actually I suspect it
doesn't work that way they actually need
the instructions damn it
James here is gonna be helping me
co-host things as we compare the smart
clapper and I'm on Team smart clapper
you're on Team clap I am on Team Hugh
all right so let's get started here
shall we
we will each present arguments for our
side of the equation and we're going to
allow the audience at the end to let us
know just like a rap battle but with no
rap and not cool
who won hey speak for yourself this is
gonna be pretty easy all right you know
what mister this is gonna be easy
i'ma let you go first no no no cuz my my
goings are responses to the limitations
of your clapper meditations no no no no
you go first
I'm ready to receive your argument okay
well let's say that your partner is
asleep and you want to turn the lights
off without waking them up can you do
that let's find out actually sure
but in the meantime I've actually got an
argument for you I can set up the
clapper in less than 15 seconds hmm
how long did it take you to set up your
cue yes
zero cuz a prime set it up for me how
long does it take to set this crap up if
you only plugged in the bridge and then
like hooked up a light like two minutes
but if you want to do some custom stuff
so I beat you by eight times mmm now you
get far less than eight times about you
allow me to demonstrate a soft-top
little too soft soft flaccid would I
turn you off shut up it can't hear me
maybe that's three clap hey wait a
second group does this factor into your
set-up time just oh wow does this thing
even work oh I'm in a way mode I'm gonna
wave ode and no no it doesn't work
okay okay okay your liability soft clap
demo stressing me oh yes okay hold on a
second that fast setup oh so there's
that allow me to demonstrate the soft
clap there we go
very unlikely to wake the way okay I'll
hear your next argument now I live in a
loft that would wake everyone up do you
mean to tell me that the clapper only
works with lamps and other lights that
plug into the wall and not say overhead
lights or maybe even completely wireless
lights like this the clapper can work
with that light because the clapper can
work with anything that plugs into a
wall
yeah sites like that was me okay
is your okay okay I always kind of
wondered why these things didn't take
off
well mr. fancy pants should have read
those instructions and clapper has an
indicator LED for each of the two
outlets indicating whether it is
receiving power or not aiding you in
diagnosis nice what's up what's your
point hit me look what do you got what
do you what can your Phillips you do
that counters that fantastic feature
well it tells me which ones are
reachable or not right on there plus the
most important thing at LTT it's RGB are
you getting that bring that over here
bring that beautiful beast over here I
want to I don't want to make you hold it
just for the shame true Ricca be' okay
raise your hand if you'd rather use hugh
granted it can do RGB but as we've
discussed many a time on this channel
sure
RGB is a cool feature lots of people
like it but not everyone is willing to
pay extra for it and with the clapper
you can control many devices at once
with an inexpensive extension cable
there we go okay so there's a cost
argument to be made here because I with
just one clapper and an inexpensive
power squid can control three lights at
once up to 400 watts according to the
box I don't think you can control him
boom I got served see so if I was in bed
with you
no bring the hand leave the hand oh and
they were like you know what I'd like to
do some light reading right now let's
see who's quicker on the draw go
that's right what if you only want to
part way why would I want that because
you want some mood lighting you know is
that right
dim the lights to 50% yeah look how long
that takes
he's consulting the literature right now
The Clapper uses a wired connection so
if your Wi-Fi is out it'll still work
hmm if your Wi-Fi is out Hugh still
works with your normal light switches
you can turn them on and off it just
displays the normal yellow light which
means it's more versatile than the
clapper because you can attach it to
lights that you don't plug into the wall
like the overhead light and still use it
the clappers more about speed so I
challenge you to another quick draw okay
because we have to assume that you don't
actually have your hue app open all the
time so first of all let's have the
lights on it's time to go to sleep who
can turn out the lights faster hey
Google turn the lights off ready set go
hey hey hey Google turn the lights off
[Laughter]
fast you're right you win on the speed
count calories burned is a whole
different metric keep in mind keep in
mind you can get hue accessories that
are physical switches I would actually
still argue that assuming that yours
wasn't actually manufactured in like the
late Ailey 80s or early 90s and is like
broken now that there is still room for
this kind of this kind of a technology
like I would love it if that's kind of
like a gesture control feature of
philips system or a Google home type
system you could configure like double
claps or triple claps and you could have
that be
like you know three claps for movie time
or like two claps for turn everything
off or whatever the case may be but I
think as much as I'm a bit of a Luddite
when it comes to smart home technology
and honestly this still holds a fair bit
of Appeal for me
James has definitely made his point ah
you see this you're grounded mister
it was the ground is the girl you get it
yes it good now go to your room alright
so this video was brought to you by ting
ting is the mobile carrier focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction when you call ting you
speak directly to a human being rather
than being put through a phone tree or
dealing with a callback or anything like
that and you don't pay extra for the
privilege the average ting bill is just
23 bucks a month per device and you can
find out if you'll save on ting they're
going to Linus dot ting comm we're gonna
have that linked in the video
description it's their savings
calculator where you enter your last few
bills and see what your ting bills would
work out - based on your usage ting has
lower mobile data rates than ever before
just ten dollars a gig beyond the first
gig and if you switch to ting they'll
pay 25% of your cancellation fee up to
$75 and there's even more so head over
to line of steam calm and you can get an
extra 25 bucks towards a new device or
off your first bill so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
