one at the intel booth at PAX Prime 2015
I mean you guys know I'm all about the
hardware sure there's like 4k video
editing and showing off like how awesome
that is in a minute but first let's
check out this machine from cyberpowerpc
it's using that sick in wind case with
the tempered glass side panel
fortunately they round those corners
otherwise I'd have no fingers at the
moment and of course it's all about
what's inside so you got a triple water
cooling radiator taking care of an intel
core i7 6700 k that is the latest
skylake processors got 32 gigs of ddr4
memory from Corsair yes that's right
ddr4 has officially hit the mainstream
that is to say you guys are finding out
about that now if you hadn't already
heard us telling you about that before
but don't worry too much about that
we've got a couple geforce gtx 980 TI is
because come on guys it's a content
creation demo sure but that doesn't mean
that you can't game in your spare time
and I mean that predate pretty much
takes care of the meat and potatoes of
it so then oh my goodness I completely
missed right we've got we got what's the
storage in here we've got an Intel 730
series SSD which they are storing all
the footage on to make sure that you
don't run into any i/o issues when
you're scrubbing through high bitrate
footage which is the demo that we're
about to see so we got Andrew here
stepping in to be my vana I really
appreciate that man thank you I mean a
little more you know cleavage might
might help if you want to be a vana may
be able to dress with like the split up
the lip button you know it's okay i will
talk to wardrobe about it i'll make sure
at the next event you got that taken
care of but I go ahead and get started
so basically he gets to pick any project
here that he wants fires up the shortcut
it launches adobe premiere pro Creative
Cloud this is the 2015 version which you
guys don't care about but I'm basically
stalling for time at this point there we
go although I'm not stalling for that
long those of you who have ever launched
from ear on a slow machine will know
that that's a pretty darn quick launch
time thank you SSDs and faster computers
so all this footage over here on the
left is 4k footage of a variety of
different cool scenes it's shot at four
k natively on a variety of different
cameras one of which is the gh4 all the
footage has been converted to prores for
k for 22 and then you can basically see
he's dragging and dropping it onto a
time like this this is the impressive
moment if you guys are video editors you
know how choppy and Jenke scrubbing
around on the timeline can be especially
with high bitrate footage and especially
with 4k footage on a 4k timeline but
that is not the experience that Andrew
is having at all right now check that
out you guys it is really hard to find
exactly the right moment and you can
waste a lot of time in video editing
lord knows unaware of this with a team
of video editors wasting their time all
day while I pay them Brandon he's given
me the shaking head maybe maybe maybe we
need you know and improved workflow
where we can enjoy this kind of thing so
once he's done all he's got to do is go
ahead say yeah I'm really happy with
this setup export it and then they've
got a really cool thing going on here at
the intel booth if you guys are ever ad
packs and you missed the intel booth you
guys are missing out because they are
giving away a poor i7 processor and all
you have to do to enter to win is just
create a video look at that so you
picked the intel 4k preset export
setting you put in your email address
and then if you want to take it home by
the way they've got these sweet thumb
drives that I just ripped out of this
without safely removing because I live
dangerously they got these sweet thumb
drives you can take your project away
with you and all you got to do is
experience what it's like editing video
on a new high-end workstation in 4k and
then you have a chance to win a core i7
processor pretty darn cool stuff you
want to go ahead and export that for us
there Vanna thank you look at this he's
like doing everything all properly while
I stand here and try and be like it so
you go one minute 40 seconds 26 because
adobe can't count but that's a subject
for another video so thanks for checking
out this video at the cyberpower 4k
editing demo at the intel booth don't
miss any of the linus tech tips PAX
