on yet another prototype machine for our
NCIX PC systems this is going to be the
updated vest of 3050 so remember the old
vest of 3050 ran with a core i5 760 and
the new updated best of 30 50 is
actually going to be using Intel's brand
new core i5 and i7 in this case an i7
gen 2 chips so this one is using the
2600 K and it's also using a freshly
released video card the geforce gtx 560
so the gtx 560 is what's enabling us to
run Metro 2033 this is the bridge level
and we're actually running at 1080p with
all of the details turned to very high
although we're not able to enable
anti-aliasing at this time ok so what
else do we have for specs on this
machine well we're going to be reusing
the fractal design define our three case
that we use for the original 3050 but
with a twist so on the performance
package of this model you actually get
the arctic white version of the define
r3 which has a completely white finish
not only on the front bezel because
remember the other ones are black
whether you get the titanium the silver
or the black they're black back here and
then it's only the front that changes
the arctic white is actually white
throughout okay so that's one of the
benefits you get with the performance
package you also get a 120 gig SSD as
your boot drive and you get 8 gigs of
ddr3 1600 megahertz Ram so that's a
pretty sweet little gaming machine both
the performance package and the base
package actually come with a kulit eco
120 millimeter water cooler and let me
just sort of outline what the
differences are between the base and the
performance and I'm totally going to
cheat and look behind you guys here or
behind a crazy Russian to tell you so
the 2600 K versus the 2500 K is what you
get in the performance package you get
the Eco 120 water cooler in both okay
you get the P 67 g 53 sli ready
motherboard in either
remember this board does include OC
Genie one-button overclocking so you can
turn up the performance of your chip
with pretty much zero effort
okay the performance package gets a
d-force GTX 560 TI card whereas the base
package gets a GTX 460 768 Meg the
performance package gets the 120 gig SSD
and also a one terabyte storage drive
whereas the base package is just using a
one terabyte drive for both boot as well
as for storage you get an upgraded power
supply so you get the s12 where that box
code here actually so you get the s12 to
620 watt power supply with the
performance package versa is just a
basic C Sonic 400 watt power supply with
the base package so I just wanted to
show you guys that we are running I'm
getting like I'm getting like killed
here right now oh hi guys so I am
running Metro 2033 on high details I am
running it at 1080p and it is providing
a pretty cool gaming experience other
than that I died with the brand new
updated Vesta 3050</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
