2013 is powered by western digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys we're here at the
plextor booth I'm not sure how many of
you watching actually watch the
livestream but if you do you might know
that we actually run a plextor m5 in our
server that runs our forum so I'm kind
of I have a feel a nice little personal
attachment to plextor because I do use
their drives in one it's something that
I have to try and maintain and control
at all points in time so when I came to
the booth I asked if they had anything
new and I expected maybe a new revision
of the m5 or something like that but no
they have a new m6 coming out it is so
new that the chips don't actually even
have labels on them they're using new
toshiba chips that were announced a day
or two ago but I don't have tons
information on that this is going to
come in 128 gigabytes 256 gigabytes and
512 gigabyte capacities it's very fast
running at sequential writes up to five
hundred forty megabytes per second and
sequential reads up to 470 megabits per
second on the on the large model but
we'll probably get the two and a 56k by
model which is running actually almost
the same speeds I'm very excited to
hopefully get one of these in and test
them on my SSD testing bench line it up
against all the other drives that we
have and see exactly how fast it
compares maybe I'm in for an upgrade on
SSD for our server so we'll see at that
point thanks for checking out our
