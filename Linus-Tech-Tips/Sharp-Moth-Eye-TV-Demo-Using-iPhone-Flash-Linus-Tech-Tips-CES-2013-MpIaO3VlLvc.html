our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality pc
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys the last thing at the sharp
booth is not quite as futuristic as AK
in fact this is another one of those
things that could be feasibly
manufactured now but they're calling it
maathai and basically the reason for the
naming is that moths have this coating
on their eyes that reduces reflection
but unlike a matte display which is
available today doesn't totally destroy
your black levels turning it into more
of a grey level so I'm gonna have slick
hold up the flash on my phone here and
we're going to start with their demo TV
here on this side right here so these
will go ahead and move a little bit
there you go this is a glossy display so
you can clearly see the light from the
flash it is reflective it's basically
like a mirror for comparison's sake
sharp has also included in their demo a
matte screen so if you guys got that
footage already you good so let's move
over to the other side here this is a
matte screen this is available today as
well so you can see how there's not
nearly as much reflectivity however the
blacks are lost they look more like a
grey more like like it's covered in a
layer of dust play frankly now we're
gonna move to the middle one which is
maathai here we get deep blacks vibrant
whites and compared to a glossy screen
we get a reduction in the amount of
light that is reflected blatt back from
the iphone 4 camera however again guys
it's a compromise so it's not quite to
the degree that a matte screen would
have that effect don't miss any of our
CES 2013 coverage don't forget to
