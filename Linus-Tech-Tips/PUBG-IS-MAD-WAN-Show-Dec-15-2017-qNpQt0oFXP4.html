awkward beginning I just wanted to make
sure everything was correct Linus isn't
here and we weren't perfectly on time
which disappoints me
well usually we've done a really good
job it's partially my fault I will take
blame for no it's actually Liza's fault
because when it's you and I were on time
yeah Linus is in the building and he may
take over yeah it's because we waited
for him that this is late yes that is
fair yeah anyways beyond all of that
kind of stuff
gonna be a great show we have some
fantastic topics some that will make you
sad some that'll make you happy you
might cry or not I actually had a little
emotional moment when I was writing the
show notes yeah it's it gets pretty deep
anyways we're gonna talk about galaxy s
9 possibly coming in February we're
gonna be talking about Intel possibly
doing steep cuts to the Intel Inside
Program and what kind of show would it
be if we didn't at least address the net
neutrality buzz this week as well as
Disney's giant 54 million dollar
acquisition of parts of fox twentieth
century fox just by the world just by it
all anything that makes media buy it
then you own all the media the Walmart
of Hollywood hey I didn't write it I saw
someone else wrote
but I like it
there we go boss yes Tesoro
Tesoro Tesoro in fresh books yes book
yeah it's slightly harder to move the
little sources around on OBS and in
xsplit not much
but slightly that's like a Coke or Pepsi
thing hey yeah yeah most of the
comparisons between the two are like
pretty major that one's that one's a
little open MCI first topic we're gonna
talk about is title to being done Zoe's
so you have some specific comments on
here yeah but one should go and you
should go first
so okay it would probably know a lot of
more about this that I know Kay so I
actually don't know about the like title
to specific stuff and I don't know a lot
about the exact implications I have a
lot of ideas of how companies and how
people are going to react to things and
how it's going to affect things but I
don't know the word of the law and I
think this is actually I think you
echoed the sentiment that a lot of
people have before we get into like
power maybe we just explain what
happened
so yeah in a three-to-two vote the
Federal Communications Commission or the
FCC Declassified internet providers as a
title to common carriers situation now
in my opinion it seems like the entire
world thinks that tomorrow you're gonna
have to like pay to use Facebook I don't
think that's gonna happen I I think it
would be interesting if they went super
hard and just wrecked people immediately
because that would probably get it read
thrown over super fast but that's not
what's gonna happen it's gonna happen
slowly before anything directly affects
users I think the first things they're
gonna happen is a lot of like kind of
inside
industry deal kind of stuff making
Netflix pay them so they can actually
distribute their content properly
blocking content of certain people on on
different ISPs or on different devices
or whatever so they can push their own
products that are similar yeah
a lot of that kind of stuff is what I
suspect is gonna happen that did happen
in the past one point yeah exactly got
reprimanded yes but as okay this is
where I could totally be wrong as far as
I know this was in place to try to stop
to make it easier for the reprimanding
to happen and this being potentially
sort of gone now the title 2 thing is
gone now not the entirety of it I know
that makes it easier for them to do
those things and not get reprimanded huh
as far as I understand so everybody
likes net neutrality there's like I
don't think there are many people maybe
actually know some people maybe these
businesses but like I think we can all
agree that nobody wants to have a
situation like the one you're describing
my problem is how this whole issue is
being framed like all the articles today
like The Verge in particular it's like
the FCC votes to kill net neutrality net
neutrality is done like the world's over
and there's no distinction being made
that like actually net neutrality isn't
over
it's just title two that's over I don't
think this debate really and the FCC guy
who always gets quoted like the evil guy
I don't really think he's evil I think
he's just like answering a different
question the question has been framed by
the media as do we want net neutrality
where as the the question that's
actually happening with our being
answered with this vote is how do we
want net neutrality to be enforced and
they've decided that title 2 isn't the
way to do it and it comes down to the
two different ways that you can regulate
so they're the one approach is called ex
ante which is regulating something kind
of proactively so mistakes don't happen
and that's a really great way to do it
when the stakes are super super super
high where if it's like if this nuclear
bomb gets dropped the world's over so
that cannot happen I think I think it
also imma let you finish one thing I'm
gonna drop in is I think the the stakes
being super high is a little bit of a
perspective thing there's a lot of
people that are running
companies like we are both through linus
media group and floatplane media that
could be severely hurt here people could
lose jobs people could blow a livelihood
people could lose entire companies that
could in some people's opinion and their
life so agreed agree there's some scale
going on there but yeah I will let you
continue now I agree with that but I
think that those things can be thwarted
by the other type of regulation which is
ex post which is when you you're more
reactionary with the regulation which is
what we had before
prior to 28 15 prior to the title 2
which is where ISPs would try to do
stuff like promoting their own products
first and then they would get
reprimanded for it and then after that
happened no other ISPs would make that
mistake again so yeah there's like
people's livelihoods on the line but
then regulators step in and slap their
wrists and/or sue them or whatever and
then it seems to be enough and the
reason that you even have to make the
choice between one or the other seeing
as the title 2 version seems way more
safe is because in theory it costs a lot
more and that would in theory kind of
put a damper on innovation and we want
innovation because we want there to be
better broadband tomorrow than today but
then there's also the situation where
like now I'm jumping into something
that's not in the notes and I don't have
the exact name for but people talk a lot
about how the American populace paid
through tax dollars huge ludicrous
amounts of money to get fiber laid out
and then nothing was ever done with it
I've done some research on that that's
not exactly how it worked it was
actually way worse what happened was the
telecommunications companies of whatever
sort were able to put a fee like
government is okay with this fee on
everything and that fee was supposed to
directly and solely contribute to the
rollout of fiber across all over the
place and it's easier to do it in cities
but the city people would have to keep
paying the fee so that the more
difficult places would be developed that
was part of the idea that has not been
acted on at all
and that fee is whoops I'm broadcasting
my screen and that fee is still going on
and as far as anyone can tell there's no
intention of that ever becoming a thing
anyways so I don't think there's when
you talk about the inspiration to
innovate in somewhere like up here
usually you have like two options or
sure maybe three maybe probably not for
2-pam where you live there are
technically some places of Vancouver
where you can get like a lot of
different isp options but it's really
uncommon out here usually you get to its
tell us or Shah in a huge percentage of
the states there is no option you have
one is B there is no incentive to
innovate not because they can't charge
more they're charging a lot for one
Internet is extremely expensive in
America and for two they have this
freaking snot attacks but a fee thing
that's put on all of their charges that
is supposed to directly be like the
American government being like here
innovate and they're just not doing that
it just does because they're like here
money pocket no do anything sounds good
so I I understand the like you need to
be able to charge more so you can have
money in the bank so that you can
innovate from a company perspective like
for full plain media for example the fee
that we take like if we ignore the the
amount of money that goes to the creator
which is not a thing they're getting
money for doing work that's how that
works
but our fee some of it is to cover our
current overhead in terms of staff and
in terms of like building and chairs and
tables and computers and whatnot and
part of it is so that we can have a
little bit of extra money that we can
put in the bank then we can sit on that
little bit of extra money and if we need
to buy a piece of software to enhance
our service or add more troubleshooting
or if we need to hire another person we
can go like okay this is fine we have
this one here we can innovate in this
way we can spend the money making the
thing we can do the thing that is
important but they've already had
an extremely great example of that which
is that consistent fee for every single
person in America that have subscribed
to a Internet service as far as I know
and they're not innovating America still
has like actually pretty bad internet
you go to like anywhere in Europe or
pretty much any Asian country that I've
been to and you go to like hotel lobby
Wi-Fi and it's like holy crap if I could
have this as like the dedicated line
into my house I would be so happy it's
not like it's just a factor this size
though like I think that in some of the
urban centers in the States it's as good
well not maybe it was like Japan level
but it's there's definitely wrong yeah
just not consistent across the nation
you can get gigabit in some places for
sure and you can get gigabit in
Vancouver even as well and it's not just
Google Fiber that is definitely true but
there is also a lot of places where you
can't where you absolutely should be
able to and most of those places is
where there's no competition usually
where you actually see something like
fiber is because these
telecommunications companies haven't
been able to sue a small company into
the ground and forcing them to not be
able to compete mmm which is a thing
that has happened a lot in the US and
there's definitely like like if you look
at somewhere like Taiwan most of the
country super easy to get internet to
it's a fairly small island essentially
mmm and you can network the whole thing
it's it's a lot easier to do than like
Canada but Canada's problems are almost
more understandable than Americas
because we are so spread out but then at
the same time if you look at Canada's
population across the map it's like
empty empty empty empty empty empty
empty empty empty this is the border to
America empty empty empty empty everyone
is like right here so we're all kind of
in a thin line and like population
centers it's weird whenever I hear
people talking about the u.s. when they
talk about more than one significant
city in a state because it's like almost
not a thing up here we have like a
couple provinces that have more than one
city that are like major but if you
think about outside people everyone's
got to
what other city in BC Victoria uh it's
like okay the definition of major yeah
is different there's a school and and
there's retirees Calgary and there's
Edmonton yep
there's Montreal Quebec City yep there's
in Ontario the buttload yes like but
it's it's like barely st. John's in
quarter Brooke Alex walking by with his
maritime er Nova Scotia law knowledge
there but it's just like we if you're
trying to run networking across Canada
you kind of have like a corridor to the
blip like laughs here's a whole bunch of
people not very much use a whole bunch
of people not very much there's a lot of
that going on there is obviously some
that's not true situations where cities
like much higher up like pottery
anemones yeah and and whatnot but it's
like it's not impossible
and luckily up here the the fact that
there's almost always definitely not
true for all situations but almost
always to ISPs fighting we've seen quite
a bit of innovation Shaw recently tried
to screw around and say that they were
sending fiber to people's homes when
they are actually sending fibre to the
node and then copper to the home so
Telus was like no we wrote actual fiber
to the home and then they took like a
whole bunch of market share because of
that there was a little fight going on
between them we need them to be fighting
exactly I don't know but like you were
saying this is not necessarily the end
of net neutrality this is its title to
status yeah I basically said my piece
cuz I really don't know that much I
don't want to look like fool yeah I I
have heard that the FTC the Federal
Trade Commission is the entity that
ought to be regulating this type of
thing not the FCC no but I think it's
just a big question mark they're just
like will they do it right yeah I don't
I don't know the America has so many
different
government agency things and we're just
Canadian in it it is yeah you drive down
here to yeah exact American and schooled
in law yeah I don't know it's it's an
extremely complicated situation we're
probably not the best ones to talk about
it
my thing is I have an odd amount of
information about like the things around
it like that weird fee thing and also
the kind of but I don't know the word of
the law I don't know what actually like
happens now that it's not title to
because I barely even understand what
title two is I'm gonna take the position
that everything's gonna be okay
we hope yeah yeah we hope give me I it
could be really bad for us up here so
we're just we're just hoping that
everything sort of you know survives
down there it's it's always interesting
Canadian because so much of what happens
in America is extremely important to us
so like I know of quite a few Canadians
that pay attention to American politics
more than Canadian politics not only
because it's far more crazy are our
major controversy if you want to see
like hilarious Canadian politics our
major controversy of this year I think
was elbow gate was that this year I
don't know oh wait a second yeah yeah II
like bumped into the yeah well what
about there's local issues there's a big
dam that they just made it's like a big
deal yeah it's twelve billion dollars
but we don't have someone tweeting to
another like nuclear-armed so it's not
only you know any little fireball can be
huge
not only is it more animated down there
I'd say but everything that happens in
the state extremely strongly affects
Canada and we often foes and basically
picturing Trump with like Triple H's
hair and like tassels from his elbows
coming on to this on to this bit on W
yeah he's walking on to the Candace now
with a microphone like I've been sitting
backstage listening to you run your
mouth
Oh John cracking some beers together I
guess speaking of crazy cinematic
experiences like that Disney to acquire
21st Century Fox for 52.4 a billion
dollar per billion I'm stoked on this
really kinda cuz a lot of people are
you're gonna be the contrary in this
dream that is fun that is good
like antitrust concerns the concern here
I don't I'm not entirely sure what
defines that so maybe but I think it's
just like their their Disney starting to
eat everything up and it's kind of
scaring people a little bit well it
depends on the scale you think about
because on the other hand Netflix is
eating everything up and they're gonna
and they have been just steadily raising
their prices and like they're taking
over the only thing that TV is good for
now is sports so when Netflix is all
that matters because who cares about
prime video or Hulu hey man they got a
Lord of the Rings series coming on prime
video they're doing they have the Grand
Tour there they're trying but we need
competition right yeah yeah and I think
we also need TV to die so I think I kind
of like what it what Disney's doing here
to make it clear for everybody they're
not just straight up buying 21st Century
Fox they're buying the majority of their
properties so what's not included and is
Fox News they're not allowing Fox News
they're not buying the Fox broadcast
network they're not buying fs1 sports
cable channel what they are getting a
bunch of stuff including The Simpsons
homeland this is us Modern Family that's
all the Fox television studio stuff yeah
yeah they're getting television studio
stuff which includes 36 different series
which includes those four things I just
said they are also getting the regional
sports networks which is a big deal oh
yeah so Disney has already announced
plans to introduce to streaming services
by the end of 2019 they already own ESPN
so they're gonna have ESPN Plus but
which is coming in the spring but ESPN
Plus is now also going to have these
regional basketball
something that so out yeah so that's
actually huge because like you said
earlier TVs of course there's other
things on it but TV is very heavily for
sports not only for the only reason the
other things are on TV is because
they're bundled with sports often yeah
yeah so like that's crazy and and
regional is quite important that's
really cool the second streaming service
they want to offer is built around their
other properties like Disney Marvel
Lucasfilm and Pixar they haven't named
that streaming service yet and it's but
it's gonna roll out late that's why they
were pulling the Star Wars series off of
Netflix yeah it's gonna go on their own
and on top of that Disney already owned
30% of hooli weight I always mess this
up because the Silicon Valley yeah they
own Gavin Belson's company who they own
they owned 30% of it but now they're
getting more through this acquisition so
they actually will have a majority stake
in that the other people who own Hulu
are Comcast and Time Warner I think
among others and that that streaming
service is more for adult audiences or
grown-ups boring stuff ABC shows yeah so
there's interesting yeah they're gonna
have a lot of streaming services it
there's a quote here from Bob Iger who's
you said it's like their highest
priority going direct to consumer is
their highest priority would you think
about it is a crazy cultural shift an
organizational shift for Disney who
traditionally they've had this content
and they need to pimp it out to as many
distributors as possible so that's very
horizontally integrated now they're
flipping that so we have this content
and we're going vertically stripping the
in being the district distributor and
giving it to the consumer that's like
that's an ambitious and like legacy
defining thing for us well we're trying
to stay on top of it one of the scariest
things for a company like this is
becoming that old company that just
becomes behind the times
yeah so they're trying to stay on top of
it it
I've run full plane so this is a little
bit of a contradictory thing to say but
while it might not be feel great to
everyone to have another streaming
service that they have to pay for to get
the content that they want it's it's
gonna be interesting and like maybe it
will maybe it will mean more stuff I
have no idea hopefully that's true it's
gonna be sweet though because the thing
with Netflix it's like there's a
bajillion things on Netflix and then you
go to watch Netflix and you're like
there's nothing on Netflix there's a
bunch of like low-budge documentaries
b-list movies man I like low budget
talking sometimes like it's obviously
getting better but like for the longest
time especially in Canada it's been
direct now there's gonna be a new
service where you can just watch all the
Simpsons all the found the guys right
yeah they have so many awesome
properties under their umbrellas give me
wicked the the Fox television studio
part will be pretty cool yeah for sure
it's gonna be interesting because the
Lucasfilm stuff been buying 21st Century
Fox means they have the old properties
for Lucasfilm meaning like the original
series something like that interesting
interesting you'll just anyone with kids
is gonna buy that like pop it down and
your kid can just watch every Disney
movie ever like kids only need two
Disney movies it's on repeat it is we've
reinforced that with YouTube too they'll
just sit and replay the same thing
forever
give me sweet yeah you want to do this
one
I feel like this sure the loop topic
yeah let's go for it
hub G creator says games need better
protection from copycat titles so for
people who don't know player unknown
battlegrounds is a game kind of a new
issue on row that it's pioneering called
the Bower Royale type of genre
I think I think technically they're not
pioneering it I don't remember there
okay
there's always someone who's first it's
like yeah Paul did invent in the
computer yeah like they definitely were
the ones that like exploded it and
massively popularized it etc but I
believe again I'm not super I'm not
super well-versed on this but I believe
there was a game that this guy even
contributed to slightly this could be
wrong sorry mods for ArmA and h1z1 okay
yeah which were both like it was an ARMA
mod that was basically this just you
don't fly it on a plane I think an h1z1
which is like basically this but I think
you also don't fly on a plane so maybe
they're upset about planes I don't know
we should not only we someone tweeted me
or or commented last time that we didn't
read out the the names of the forum
posters oh geez I'm pretty bad about
that so there's a great thread about
this on the forum I even wrote post that
was the greatest segue ever you want to
grab that real quick did the Disney post
was posted by D kress jr. the title to
is done so post was by evil cat 70 and I
think that's it this one's posted by
Purina whose name I actually always
loved reading and I like the
accompanying picture it's just a
peaceful name and he's got a little
clown fish beside I just like that guy I
think it's Marino what oh well it's a
Pokemon bias I just go it just sounds
more Pokemon that's very that's my other
favorite of person's name on the forum
is max settings yeah anyway in the forum
post the Perino brings up the fact that
before perhaps before these games there
was at least movies with this type of Oh
like the movie Bower yeah which is
almost exactly this like you're on an
island yes the concept itself it's an
interesting thing because
he they definitely have a point with
there's some specific games I know right
here they call it in China there are
several titles that have the same
premise gameplay and even graphics some
are barely distinguishable from pub G
itself others have special license like
a terminator to fiat version so to back
up the game is so popular that is a
bunch of spin-off kind of copycat titles
I'm not affiliated at all but kind of
just like knockoffs yeah so I in some
ways I kind of agree where like if it if
it is basically exactly the same then
sure but they say right in here I want
other developers to put their own spin
on the genre not just lift things from
our own game
different things are going to get lifted
from every game if you look into the
history of gaming FPS games used to be
called doom clones with a doom clones oh
yeah because they all have the same
engine yeah and they kind of felt pretty
similar but they were technically
different games
mhm and there was slightly different
things about it like I don't personally
find it offensive that fortnight is it's
a little weird that you like flying on a
bus in the exact same way that you
flying on a plane on pub G that's a
little weird I just gonna lie I want to
pose the question the example you
brought up a second ago in those early
games like the first first-person
shooter yeah it's like a lot of
potential to do other things yeah like
you know it's not a very big sandbox and
that's fair but it is it is a very
different gameplay experience to play
the free fortnight 50 V 50 or whatever
they call it like battle royale style
game I don't actually know the proper
name for it I only played two rounds
only playing two rounds it is an
extremely different game I got freaking
rekt because some guy needed to run up a
mountain so he just and it was too steep
so he just built stairs and while he was
running up the stairs he was building
new stairs he just went the whole way
and I was like I didn't think you could
put through what the and my uncle like
build fortresses and in the 50 V 50
version which pub G doesn't have it's 50
people versus 50 people you still have
four man squads and you drop it in your
little squad you probably gonna Duke it
out
with a couple other formats squaws that
are on the other team but eventually you
get in a big group that's so cool ball
up you're all building like fortress
walls together and stuff it's a very
different gameplay experience and they
have gone after fortnight so that on my
opinion takes a little road solidity a
wing but then they also do have a valid
argument well the bigger argument here
is there's no intellectual property
protection in games this is a quote in
movies and music there's IP protection
and you can really look after your work
but in gaming that doesn't exist yet and
this is something that should be looked
into pretty interesting yeah IP
protection stuff gets abused a lot you
mean there's actually probably when Tom
Petty or is like yo your song sounds
just like won't back down and then
because it's the same chord protection
even though there is a finite number of
chord progressions in the universe yeah
and like what was that for chord
whatever like everyone is running the
same thing anyways so like and all the
songs actually sound quite different but
they are running the same back yeah
because the chords aren't the whole only
thing you put that together with a
melody yes so the author the
combinations is awesome so like when you
see like a mobile game that's called
like player unknown no apostrophe s
battle floor icon and it's essentially
the exact same game but it's like mobile
or something I think there's a lot of
knockoffs on mobile yeah that's rough I
that's obviously ridiculous if if
there's some game in China or a game in
North America that I don't personally
know of that is like they say same
premise game play and even graphics and
if by same they mean actually the same
and it has all of those things that are
the same that's a problem definitely in
my opinion that is a problem do you
think there's incentive for the App
Store's to be the ones who moderate that
as far as I know there's like a certain
degree they do how the app stores do
alright but on something like Windows
there's no you just download the file
read so there's
they can really do and windows tried to
solve that and everyone hated it with a
good reason because it was terrible the
Windows Store is not a fun experience
it's almost like freedom of speech it's
like it's so good when it's free that
you got to put up with bad stuff yeah
and then but then like yeah but then
profiting off of it is another thing and
and like especially when they try to
make the name almost the same yeah as
they're abusing the search terms because
like I I have seen I don't remember
where it was player unknown battles
something and I think the last word was
changed but they were trying to get with
the apostrophe yeah yeah yeah they're
trying to be like people are gonna
forget that it's unknowns the search
engine optimization there is a big piece
of that I'm sure like you're getting so
many matched characters there is it just
playing yeah it's player unknowns
there's an apostrophe s yeah but on the
real one on the real one yeah but uh I
don't I don't remember what it was I
don't even know if it's still around but
I remember at some point I saw I guess
I'll sure mice it's actually the knocker
was actually player UNK known well your
uncle now this is like jumble is an an
over anagram you know if you don't have
to actually read if as long as like the
first and last letter or the same you
can yeah just like that just know it
actually tell it would be like dota is a
clone of lol yeah which like if anyone's
played the two games they absolutely
know okay first of all defense of the
ancients came out first so you get
conked come on but if you played the two
games if you played defense of the
ancients the Warcraft 3 mod and then
played League of Legends you'd be like
wow this is really different and then
when dota 2 came out if you played the
first game and then League and then dota
2 you would be like wow this is really
different again they're very different
genres there they're both defensive the
ancient style of games you still have
top middle bottom lane you still have
jungling you still have hero selection
you still have creep waves you still
have killing minions for money there's
lots of those different types of similar
mechanics but they are very different
games and like I think it actually takes
a different
style of person to play each one of
course if someone's like a pro dota
player or League player that can
probably go back and forth through a
certain degree with enough time spent in
the game and if you threw like a pro
dota player against a noob League player
I'm sure they would wreck them in the
noobs game but like that transitions
over to almost anything I'm sure a pro
Cod player versus someone who's like
never played shooter games before would
be able to beat the person in
counter-strike oh for sure even though
they're like drastically different games
they're both first-person shooters but
they're drastically different games
that's even more of a split than the
league and dota thing so I'm not trying
to pull it that far away I'm not trying
to strawman that much but like I know
what you're talking about we get it yeah
yeah Amazon gets it to Amazon and Google
I I actually put I've put this story in
the wand ox for a couple of weeks cuz
it's kind of been evolving but I don't
know if you guys have actually talked
about it I haven't even seen it which
one is it we're down a little bit starts
with Amazon okay so in that light let's
start from the beginning yeah so what
happened was Google said hey Amazon on
your echo show device we're not gonna
let you have the YouTube app anymore and
the reason is because your YouTube app
is actually violating our Terms of
Service service because it's not living
a great customer experience because
there's features missing on the Amazon
echo show which is the echo device that
that has a screen on it okay they didn't
have things like there was no
subscribers
there was no recommended next video like
these things are pretty core to the
YouTube experience these days and for
that reason Google had a nice so this is
it by the way I haven't seen it before
even so yeah this is the toys there's a
billion different Amazon devices now so
that you could watch YouTube on that
before ok um but then Google said yeah
you gotta drop that because he didn't do
it right
then Amazon said okay we're gonna go
behind Google's back and we're gonna
implement a new version of YouTube
that's based on the web browser
it was pretty jank it was basically just
like you know when you're on your Smart
TV and try to use
the web browser apparently was like
pretty much that bad and they did this
behind Google's back without their
authorization and then Google pulled
that one but it's see it sounds like
it's because of their Terms of Service
but there's a flip side of the story
which is Amazon hasn't sold does not
sell Google homes hasn't sold chromecast
in two years and stopped selling nest
devices and nests is now owned by Google
so it's like are they pulling these
YouTube because the Terms of Service
violations are they pulling YouTube
because they're pissed it's it's
reciprocal right so yeah so now the
situation was that they pulled when they
pulled YouTube the second time from the
show they also were like you know what
we're also pulling YouTube from fire TV
which is the same as like Roku like
that's a big deal and you need you need
to have YouTube on your on these
services so that that's the basically
the two points of leverage because
Google would you not play with my toy
Google would love for you to be able to
buy a home on Amazon yeah because like
25% of all e-commerce is on Amazon yeah
they would love to be on there so now
apparently they're having productive
talks that's the that's the latest they
they're trying to actually make an
agreement because it is mutually
beneficial for both parties for them to
reach an agreement and something they
brought something back here Amazon
brought back selling the chromecast
that's the first concession we've seen
okay we don't know if they're gonna
start selling nest again we don't know
if they're gonna get Google home on
there I doubt it because Amazon really
wants
by the way chromecast Audio is like sick
but sorry continue I love kind of Sonia
yeah that's dope yeah anyway Amazon
really wants to take over the smart home
thing with EKKO so I don't know if
they're ever gonna have a home on there
it's speculated right now that Google
may resend their threat to take YouTube
off of fire TV because even though they
took YouTube off of the Aqua show
immediately fire TVs cancellation wasn't
gonna happen till the new year so
hopefully everyone will get everything
yeah there's some weird parts of this
like YouTube is very open API kind of
situation you
can build a website that just like grabs
YouTube videos and looks like a video
streaming website but just plays YouTube
videos and as far as I know it's fine
mm-hmm because you're just embedding
YouTube videos and you can click the
YouTube button go to their website
anyways building an app might go too far
but I don't think they actually need
like it's all open API stuff they're
just hooking into they're not like
hacking YouTube and taking the videos
right I think it's because they didn't
include some wall ostensibly they didn't
include the subscribers button or
something right it was there was no
subscribers at all you can subscribe to
things and there was no next video like
autoplay predictive which is like all of
YouTube basically yeah their algorithm
is like the whole thing yeah I think
that's what it was like I have no we
don't have this in Canada this is just
like whatever I've never even seen this
thing before
yeah I don't know that's that's
interesting I wouldn't be surprised if
it's Google or YouTube just net
neutrality is BS that's why it's gone no
that's been I'm gonna take a very short
aside back to net neutrality and then
I'll be back you poked them you poked
the bear you guys if you want to be
angry about something like net
neutrality which like by all means be
angry about it try to be angry for the
right reasons because if you just throw
it stuff that isn't actually true it
invalidates the argument as a whole and
actually hurts the side that you're
trying to fight for another thing that I
would say is try not to just throw out
like personal attacks that are baseless
unless you're like they are X because of
all of these factual reasons that are
legitimate and actually makes sense in
an argument and making fun of their
physical appearance also doesn't help
well even if the the personal attacks
are true that's still and that doesn't
help your argument it would only have to
be relevant yes and it's it's actually
kind of difficult to make personal
attacks relevant it's possible well
people did like he is a moral be
cuz ex-wife grabber by the p-word yeah
can't be President yeah is president
yeah will never be impeached no oh my
god we don't get blue just like just
just to like when you see someone and
and to be clear I'm this on the side of
like heck yeah I want net neutrality
this is a good thing I like open
Internet everyone hooray things are good
but being like yo this dude has big
teeth just makes you look really petty
and makes it so that the side that is on
the side of him just looks at you and
goes like wow our competition is small
on the internet no one was in $1.00
point yes on the internet no one knows
your dog so you might be talking the
person who wrote that might be like a 10
year old who sucks odd like the trending
topic yeah it's just like it overshadow
and it's a very quick easy thing for
people to click like on and stuff so I'm
often overshadows legitimate claims so
and there's an issue right now where a
lot of people don't actually even know
what's wrong with net neutrality
there's angry because other people are
angry there are legitimate reasons to be
angry about net neutrality going away a
lot of people don't even know them
because they're like god this guy that
were upset about his appearance is
taking whatever it is away from us
that's bad that's not a good position to
be in try to educate people make things
make sense yeah
sorry those are weird aside I just I
just wanted to dive back on there
speaking of me wanting to dive places
that's eyeballs response so who we have
today let's go to Tesoro we've parted
with Tesoro to give away ten
limited-edition Graham spectrum
keyboards shut your buddy that's this
guy right here
they were modded by the people over at
modders Inc oh that's really cool I feel
cool holding this I feel like in the
spirit of Star Wars also if you purchase
a Graham spectrum keyboard through the
link below by the end of the holidays
you received two magnetic overlays like
this one and I had to check this out
before the stream so I actually the
generally thought this is pretty cool
because I was like what the heck
is a keyboard overlay goes like this
isn't oh it's one of those plastic
covers like at the library but it's
magnetic and it's like this one's like
marble right and it actually looks
pretty sick oh sorry
and I think that's kind of a neat way to
hide your keyboard oh okay so it goes on
like the body it doesn't go on the keys
okay that's sweet that's the opposite of
what I thought it was yeah that's I
actually thought that too so you're not
alone when I first saw this now the
world knows we're all on the right page
now yeah so you it's hard to see from
back there but there's essentially the
layout of a keyboard here and you would
push out the areas that are like where
the the keys aren't stuff and it would
go on the body around the keyboard to
give the body of the keyboard a nice
marble look and then you still have your
like RGB black key caps black key caps
RGB along with white marble nice it
pretty good keeps the monochrome kind of
idea going on so you can pick whatever
RGB color you want I'm looking at the
blocks I'm checking out these
low-profile keys yeah man key caps
yeah that's sweet you guys some win one
we're giving ten away I'll post in the
which chat is that probably not get
owned now I'm working here sometimes
sucks
you can't enter giveaways and then like
even if you're allowed to enter a
giveaway if you win everyone's like yeah
it's legit rigged Luke held the hat up
real high I could yeah speaking of
things that aren't rigged though
FreshBooks
because you make your own value out of
fresh books because fresh books allows
you to invoice people so you can take
money from them for the value that you
gave to them whether that was a service
whether you're like a plumber or a
carpenter or a person who pets dogs
professionally or whether that's a good
maybe you make things may be used so
little things that people hang on their
walls I don't remember what that's
called but cross it yeah sure Pappas
just you know the little they put them
in like a wooden frame and it's a
something that's a cross stitch crossed
it
cool whether you're a cross stitcher or
you do something else apparently I'm not
feeling super creative today you you can
send them invoices in like a super-low
period of time it can tell you if
they've opened the invoice or not so if
they're like yes I haven't seen your
bill so I have not been able to pay it
you can be like haha you did and then
get them to pay it which is actually
pretty sweet if you have any questions
you can reach out to them and you get to
talk to their support staff directly you
don't have to speak to a robot you just
go right to a real human no phone trees
no escalations no return calls you just
get answers nothing better than then
settling an argument with a screenshot
hey you did I have phone information
saying that what you were saying is not
true let me backpedal really busy that
day I was stressed yeah and then it's
like okay that's fine you can pay your
bill now right yeah talking everything
later there yeah exactly
anyways you get a free unrestricted
30-day trial go to FreshBooks comm slash
tech tips and enter when show in the how
did you hear about us section heck yeah
and then we have moss hmm I don't know
if we have one here oh here it is okay
that's one here's a logo these are
actually pretty sharp today we're
talking about the new and improved moss
pack and their moss nest bag
the moss nest bag is designed to hold
all your essentials without taking up
much space that's this little blue one
that he's got designed to nest inside
there outer pocket of their moss pack
that's this gap there's a lot going on
in here there is and okay I'm gonna say
one thing - this is like this even in
the sponsor notes I love it when bags
have this type of inside a really really
bright inside oh yeah you spill your
yogurt in there like this is you can
basically for one it's really easy to
clean but for two like with our blades
razor blades okay if you put a razor
blade in here one it's black you'll very
easily bill to see that your laptop's
inside to when you're like oh no where's
my power cable
well the insides all bright shiny
reflective or it that's awesome
you'll find all your stuff super easily
I
Robeson but I've never had the privilege
of a reflective inside button I'm
picking up what you're putting down it's
one also picking up this included strap
yeah literally it can fit a tablet a
phone a power bank snacks headphones
water whatever else you need no big deal
Moss pack is the backpack you plug in to
charge your things I wonder if we can
pull this out I was wondering what that
is yes so you guys can't see it super
well but there's a pot little power bar
in here that has a standard power plug
which is nice and two USB ports so you
could charge like your laptop off the
standard power plug and then like a
phone or a tablet off of the USB ports
which is actually pretty sweet this is
kind of cool there are so many pouches
you know what that really gets me going
because I love having dedicated spots
for items I really hope my mom isn't
what I'm serious I hope my wife is
watching this I hate it when things
aren't in their spots I hate wasting my
precious life looking for things like
where's the keys they belong in the dish
they're not in the dish someone else
didn't put them the dish because I
always put them to the dish and because
I always put them in there I know where
they are I can find him in the dark this
has so many little pockets so you can be
like this is the spot for the phone at
all times this is the spot for my
charger at all times I can go into a
tent just like Bam Bam Bam perfect love
it heck yeah improvements include logic
luggage pass-through on the back for
attaching a luggage handle that's cool
oh that's we haven't even looked over at
where you're holding stronger orange
lining here we go so it is in the notes
actually stronger orange lining to make
it super easy to see what's inside your
backpack it's in the sponsor notes I
love that so much I had no idea larger
water proof water bottle pocket with fly
out mesh pocket to make getting your
water bottle in and out much easier
greatly improved reinforced top handle
many other manufacturing improvements
they offer fast free shipping on all US
orders head over to Moss organizers
dot-com forward slash
there isn't a forward slash forward
slash Linus and use offer code Linus to
get 20% off to 20% off today there you
go do you think it's acronym Moss Moss
must organize stuff major phase let's go
to their website and see it looks like
it's just mom they're wet yes their
whole websites covering green yeah
we've looked at we've looked at their
cables and their magnet organizer
thingies before but this is first time
seeing their bags that's super cool okay
take it away for me my cord in there
take this you didn't see that part I
heard it but I didn't see it okay Wow
yeah you plug that into the wall
externally through this thing it's even
soft touch rubber it's not junk so you
don't have to take the stuff out of your
bag I like it it's pretty good
all right back to the actual show do you
do do you
Julia from NCI expect ups is back on
YouTube with Mike's computer shop yeah
did what they made a little trailer just
posted on the forum by stargaze thank
you very much stargaze let's go over to
why was it why did it start finished
that's weird man there we go
this is crazy because now that ncx is
like gone I've actually bought some
stuff from Mike's computer shop recently
I feel like I want to do the music for
this I don't know I can be able if the
sound is on there's there's no talking
in this video it's just like hopefully
it's not like way too loud it's just
cool music and then you see these big
black boots like oh who's this that's
someone who identifies as a woman
wearing those boots I can tell by the by
the stride the way they are boom Wow
it was Julia long MCS tech
news reviews how to's whoever wrote that
I read that earlier I was like that's
that's pretty neat it rhymes that is
pretty neat I like their writing good
job impressed only 525 views we can get
more zero dislikes so far yeah keep it
that way
good job Julie a good job Mike's
computer shop that's pretty cool what
else you know are there I think I've met
her a couple times of these but I don't
like no I mostly put this in here
because I thought lineups would be
sitting here and not me and he'd be like
oh cool you have something to say
probably personally knows there's no sir
but better yeah but I'm just happy
because that whole crew is really cool
yeah so in in I've seen what another one
of them is doing and I'm not gonna say
cuz I don't know if it's public and now
I've seen what she's doing and I'm just
happy that they're dealing be successful
I don't want to see any of them fail or
falter because they're all really cool
you know first ever SpaceX launches
reused rocket and capsule I believe this
is just kind of up and down I don't
think it's actually no that puppy's
going to ISS baby
oh really 200 pounds of payload wow
that's sick okay this is posted by no
one on the forum this is opposed to by
James in the dock yeah nobody well
actually it could be in the form I
didn't do a search but I didn't see it
on the front one or two pages so so I
heard that this wasn't what you're
saying it is so that's really exciting
they're just going for gold online no
I'm not I'm saying that I just like
heard random small-time misinformation
and didn't actually read an article
about it that's I mean it depends on
maybe you heard a first it was a
different first oh they've done the
rocket launch and land like I think 20
straight times or something without
failure
okay and they've done like launch launch
one of these dragon capsules up this is
the first time that a reused like
already spent rocket is underneath and
already spent Dragon capsule and they're
going to NASA and NASA is gonna be
receiving and already used rocket and
that's the first time for that they had
to do like a big comprehensive review to
know whether or not they wanted to
accept that they deemed it a
like a marginal increase in risk given
like the risks that already exist they
said it's basically the same so that's
wicked
and it's very bringing up real cargo
it's actually bringing up a bunch of
research materials and equipment for the
scientists that live and work up there
that is really cool this is really
exciting I don't really have a ton else
to say other than it's really this is
rebel and how it's saying that is yeah
like yeah that's amazing like imagine
every time you flew overseas on our 747
you gotta like a plane and it just
exploded
how much would your plane ticket cost
like it's pretty insane how so now
they've got going there multiple times
going to Mars going to the moon or
whatever an order of magnitude cheaper
that's so cool they're actually doing it
and if you haven't seen videos of these
rockets these first stage rockets
autonomously like landing themselves on
the again autonomous barges that are out
to sea it's so weird you think it's
Photoshop you think it's fake tits you
look like you're watching the video and
rewind it's like hold in by a string
yeah always made me think that it's like
being pulled in not at it's controlled
fall is so counterintuitive right so I
don't think anyone watching this knows
this guy don't think I ever talked about
this publicly but I tried to send a
little like mini set up okay like a
while ago and I had an adult yeah okay
and I had like what like this size let's
see probably 24 and you can you can I
know Taryn knows because I was
researching rocket fuel because I wanted
to work with a group in the States
that does like hobby rockets and they've
gotten in trouble a lot because it's
like sort of a potential for a
long-range ballistics program and it's
like just a bunch of random dudes but
really they're just trying to be like
this was before SpaceX became like
really big mmm
the SpaceX was kind of around but they
weren't really big yeah yeah yeah so I
don't remember exactly I was like 17
years now or something it's been a while
yeah but and I was trying to figure out
like how
I pay them to give them to put a little
CubeSat up oh and all this kind of stuff
and yeah I know it's it's way too much
money yeah well good thing you don't
want it to get so decentralized that
anybody can put anything in space yeah
yeah I yeah we're having a hard enough
time having everybody able to put
anything they want on the internet on
YouTube that's fair and like a clutter
around the space garbage garbage it's
not great yeah I don't know
okay I hear Linus's voice well this
show's over Linus except that we still
need to talk about floatplane come here
and talk about floatplane and let me go
home for the weekend tag me in coach bye
son
hi everyone yeah I was gonna say should
we put me in the thumbnail Wow okay we
have to do something crazy then because
usually I have an entire show worth of
like us reacting things to pull from the
first pose Dwayne show yeah yeah and
it's probably not even gonna be that
great yeah what do we have for what do
we have for stuff on floatplane right
now it's my thing should be fine should
be fine yeah you got this you got this
we've got tech wiki how does your web
browser know your location that's
actually pretty interesting
yep actually it's a and it's a really
really cool topic and there's sort of
more to it than I thought because
there's some stuff that I know already
like the IP leases you're for ISPs are
regional so therefore they can
approximate your location but then
there's a bunch of other like actually
kind of scary stuff and that's how they
know like exactly where you are without
GPS yeah which is it's neat to know how
it works
yeah contactless payment technology in a
glove that's up on YouTube no one like
it okay I mean some people liked it okay
um I like a 2/3 of people liked it there
I'll quantify who like outside of
YouTube statistics that's not bad
yeah yeah there we go we'll say we'll
take it from that um setting up
brand-new sets that's cool yeah so this
is like the team paints I rage out
because that's what happens when yeah
basically if you liked construction vlog
or moving vlog it's kind of along those
lines okay what else again what the I
just seen studio to her yeah that's the
feedback on this is really good so and
you you have talked about this before I
don't think on the show at all yeah
because this came up this week so we
wouldn't have talked about it earlier
but it's it's right we weren't gonna
talk about it too much because it's
spoilers
yeah everything's kind of a spoiler but
I'll say this if you weren't intrigued
enough to sign up for floatplane already
I'll try this
wrapping paper wrapping paper fetish
what see now you're intrigued aren't you
okay moving on okay how to boost your
cell signal yeah that's a quickie the
dumb blonde of Virtual Assistants nice
the geebo robot the tweet for this was
glorious this thing is so bad like I
can't believe it's on the cover of Time
they clearly it's only cover of time
yeah as one of the top 25 inventions
this year they clearly never even looked
at it that like actually hurts my soul
yeah like they're not they weren't even
trying all right and then I think we're
almost getting back to last week but
we've got 1070 SLI and a slim laptop
that's insane quite the question mark in
the title is it stupid yes yes it is but
you can watch the video if you want the
longer more verbose version of that if
you want us to explain why texture it on
candy battle yeah Tech showdown and part
1 is up I don't know if you knew that is
it on YouTube no yeah okay so I did know
that so part one is on floatplane part
two is
to floatplane tomorrow part one is
coming to YouTube tomorrow okay yeah so
tech showdown has been sort of
reimagined heavily heavily reimagined
it's it's more like scrapyard Wars of
modding and less like arts and crafts
though to be clear there's still arts
and crafts and we don't buy anything
used but he's not wrong yeah I don't
know that's actually a pretty good
description but there's also the weird
caveats that go against it anyways yeah
tons of great stuff on floatplane and
that's pretty much the show you missed
the almost all of it okay I have to go
review the razor phone video with Taryn
okay he just finished editing it so
you're also leaving again yeah alright
well there you go
all right
that are as big as your fist dumb okay
