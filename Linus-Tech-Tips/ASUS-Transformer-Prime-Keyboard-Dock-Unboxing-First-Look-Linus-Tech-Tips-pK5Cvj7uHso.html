accessory but probably the most
compelling tablet accessory that has yet
to exist so no I'm not talking about you
know cute little carrying cases or
jewel-encrusted well carrying cases er I
mean really that seems to be what most
tablet accessories are these days is
carrying cases but no this is the
transformer prime well II pad
transformer prime keyboard dock
attachment and this is the black or gray
or whatever they want to call it it's
that color it's not the other color so
that goes with the transformer prime
that I have here so you can see there's
a couple of logos on here we've got HDMI
powered by nvidia tegra a Tegra 3 mind
you although that's not in the keyboard
attachment itself so what is the
keyboard attachment itself well it does
a few things one it's a keyboard okay so
that part is fairly self-explanatory
there's the keyboard aspect of it too it
is like remember those old docking
stations that you used to get the old
notebooks that had like additional
expansion like they'd have a parallel
port for your printer and stuff like
that well this is kind of like that as
well because it has additional i/o
including actually you know we'll go
through the additional i/o later and
then last but not least it also has an
additional supplementary battery so okay
what asus has to say is dock and charge
the pad for up to 18 hours of battery
life that seems a little optimistic
especially based on what I've seen so
far but what it does do is once you plug
it into your transformer prime it does
charge the primes battery off of the
battery that is on the keyboard rock
itself which is very very cool so we got
a touchpad we get a keyboard we get some
additional IO and we get additional
battery life how can you go wrong well
there's one way to go wrong no
unfortunately your old keyboard dock is
not compatible with the new transformer
and your new transformer keyboard dock
is not Trenton under work
hmm no okay so your new keyboard dock is
not compatible with the oldest
transformer so why don't we have a
closer look at it so you're gonna see
it's got a great finish to it I mean the
transformer prime is just leagues ahead
of the original transformer in terms of
the overall build quality check out the
brushed metal finish here let's have a
look at the keyboard layout itself
actually so we've got correctly
positioned shift keys correctly position
enter long backspace overall no
complaints it's a chiclet style keyboard
very short travel distances on these
keys but that is to be expected because
the last thing you want is high profile
keys that are gonna stand a chance of
scratching your keypad or scratching
your screen when you have the thing
closed the hinge looks like it's very
high quality you can see it's quite
difficult for me to move it right now
but once the the transformer Prime's on
there giving the additional leverage it
should be fine very solid metal
construction though so every part of the
hinge should be very very robust there's
the lock button so oh yeah I'm guessing
that moves once I actually plug
something into it and you can see the
transformer prawns a Seuss's proprietary
docking connector right down there
you've also got a number of hot keys so
instead of F keys we've replaced all of
those with just pure hot key so you
don't actually have to hold down a
function key in order to make it happen
so we've got you know your wireless
Bluetooth brightness up brightness down
auto brightness it's not really the
internet button because that looks an
awful lot like an internet explorer
thing but I'm sure they prefer you use
Chrome full QWERTY keyboard and touchpad
easy file sharing with Bilson ah SD
cards in USB so I want to show you guys
the improved i/o so what we got here
this is a you okay whatever it's labeled
that's a USB port right over here is a
full sized SD card slot on the other
side we have okay right so that replaces
the dock connector on the bottom of the
transformer prime when it's plugged into
the to the base station so that's how
you'll charge both the keyboard dock as
well as the transformer prime once they
are connected together I want you guys
to check out the bottom I've put a
couple of finger prints on it already
but you know how it is
so there's your brushed metal finish
even on the bottom of the device
so a Seuss has really taken a page out
of Apple's book when it comes to
finishing every aspect of the device in
as beautiful away as possible rather
than sort of what I would consider to be
more like the traditional PC approach
which is to take the underside of things
like a notebook and not really worry too
much about them so I'm just taking out
these rubber inserts and I'm going to go
ahead and plug the transformer Prime
into the docking station so with the
actual intended tablet this should be
far less difficult than it was when I
was trying to do it with the wrong ones
you're just gonna make sure you have it
lined up right there it goes it locks
into place and then all you got to do is
boot this bad boy up
and it should be detected in a pretty
yeah there we go
docking connected you skip you got to be
kidding me there's the instructions use
keyboard to type words thank you google
and isus for that so I just wanted to
show you guys what the profile of the
device is like you know what actually
give me a sec I'll be right back so it
occurs to me I want to show you guys the
profile of the device compared to the
older Asus Transformer which is right
here so you can see that even with the
keyboard dock the new transformer isn't
that much thicker than the old
transformer which is very very cool asus
has done a fantastic job with the
transformer prime now you compare it to
something like this is a first
generation Acer Aspire one
look how thin it is compared to a
netbook this netbook with the battery it
has which is not a six cell battery is
only capable of about two hours of
battery life whereas the transformer
prime is capable of well over fourteen
hours of battery life once you include
the extra keyboard dock the last thing I
want to compare it to in terms of its
size once you put the keyboard on is the
iPad 2 just because it's kind of the de
facto standard for tablet comparisons I
want to make sure that I have it in
there so you guys have a clearer idea oh
it's even more broken than it was before
what a bummer
that's that crack keeps spreading I
might have to might have to get that
glass replaced so there is the profile
compared to the iPad 2 so here we go
transformer one iPad 2
transformer Prime with Tegra 3 and the
additional keyboard dock thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the keyboard dock and this beautiful
little piece of machinery from a soos
