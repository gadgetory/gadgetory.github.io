have come all the way down to Seattle
Washington to check out the most
powerful CPU workstation on the planet
worked like sort of pretty close anyway
fusion systems was too cheap to ship it
to me so they made me come all the way
down here let's go have a look inside
and see if it lives up to all the hype
the Aria headphones from Phoenix come
complete with a cardioid clipped mic and
acoustic chambers constructed entirely
of Japanese pine wood click the link in
the video description to learn more and
here it is the Puget Peak quad this
monster of a system has oh crap no this
is the old revision wall so the current
revision that they actually have to
spend three days modifying the case just
to get the freaking enormous motherboard
to fit inside let's go have a look at
the prototype one that they are working
on ah here it is this is the new and
improved Puget systems peak quad the
case is actually a collaboration with
case labs who you've probably heard
about some point or another so
construction quality feels pretty good
but it's still missing a few features
Puget figures they've got about 17
things to add still including an SSD
mount that isn't on top of the optical
drive they're thinking maybe on the back
of the motherboard as well as some fans
on the side panel that actually don't
need to be unplugged when you open up
the side panel that swings off and
swings out and up a little something
like that but of course you're not here
to see the case you guys want to see the
guts inside so this my friends is a
Super Micro x10 qvl 4 CT motherboard
which uses a form factor that I can
pretty much guarantee unless you browse
Super micros website for fun yeah nobody
does that unless you do that you
probably pretty much never seen and
that's why they needed to either design
a custom case or like do custom
fabrication on an existing case because
look at this freaking thing the IO is
like you know when it whatever that is
it's like 4 inches down from the top of
the board the PCI Express slots well
they're just like way down at the bottom
you've got to use a riser and then like
an expansion hard PCB if you even want
to put two cards in it and the whole
thing is covered with CPUs and rim
yes my friends quad CPUs water-cooled
buy Corsair h-60 s and using their laser
cutter they actually create these
acrylic and then sort of vanity plated
hold downs for them so they can mount
them on a narrow ILM LGA 2011 v3 socket
in terms of cooling this kind of a beast
you can see each CPU has its own heat
sink for the vrm that goes along with it
and this is where things get crazy town
each of these CPUs actually has a
hundred and twenty eight gigs of ram on
it with the system being capable of
holding up to four times that much so
altogether the system has 512 gigs of
DDR 4 memory and can hold up to two
freaking terabytes but if that's not
impressive enough for you check out the
video card so we actually went and
grabbed these from something else
they're not for this particular system
over like come on its holy just for
whatever we got in here so we've got a
couple of invidious Quadro m six
thousand twenty-four gig video cards
making for a total of 48 gigs a video
memory in this system so it's a total of
like almost 600 gigs of ram although it
really doesn't work that way that's not
how like memory works you don't get to
just add it all up how do you power
system like this that's a great question
I'm glad you asked they're actually
using an EVGA supernova 1600 p2 this is
the same power supply that we used back
when we did seven gamers one CPU and for
good reason the motherboard alone
requires a 24 pin power connector and
for counting for EPS 8 pin connectors
because it has wait for it 4 CPUs right
okay so that's fine Linus but what is
all of that translate to in terms of
real-world performance well in task
manager you can see that our for 7 88 67
v3 processors
make for a total of 64 cores and do we
have hyper-threading disabled it was off
we're going to fix that and of course
super micro that is not f10 to save
changes and reset I so I will go here
and we'll be back all right let's try
that again
opening up task manager boom there's our
512 gigs of ram so the fact that we're
using seven gigs of ram right now and
that is 1% of our system memory if that
doesn't tickle you guys then you clearly
don't have the same tickler spots that i
do and now we've got all 64 of our real
course all 128 sockets and you guys have
probably noticed for running Windows
Server 2012 yes because we have for
physical sockets on the motherboard we
actually have no choice but to run a
Windows server operating system because
the consumer ones will not support this
check this out we actually have to
scroll we have to scroll and the current
version of this system with the 88 67 v4
would actually have slightly more
processors I think like another 8 but of
course that's not what you guys really
want to see you want to know but does it
run Cinebench Wow look at it go hah if
you've ever run that on your macbook
then hild you'll know that it I mean
look at this 6000 139 points it's crazy
it's unnatural and it's actually not
even as crazy as it gets this system can
be configured with up to 96 total course
a hundred and ninety-two threads
mind you you'd be paying a pretty penny
for that because even in the
configuration that we're looking at here
today I configured a reasonable
approximation of this on puget site you
would be looking at see this has 35,000
$496 but actually that's with only one
Quadro and 6,000 and here if you add the
second one you'd be looking at $40,000
to take home a system like this
peripherals not included shipping not
included
is another surcharge is not included so
unless you're a freakin baller or you're
using it for legitimate purposes like
you know gas and mining exploration like
crazy number crunching stuff like that
you might as well not even drool after
this system because as much as watching
Cinebench numbers that are from the
planet Mars is pretty cool there are
disadvantages to running a system like
this as a general desktop for example I
can't even wait here talking buying time
long enough for you guys to watch this
thing boot it takes like multiple
minutes to post because of all the RAM
and the fact that it's not a server
motherboard in it but that doesn't
change the fact that it's cool and that
doesn't make it any less deserving on
the spot on Holi which I hope you guys
enjoyed I will see you again next time
speaking of a lot of money brain tree
brain trees free trial gives you fifty
thousand dollars in transactions fee
free yes my friends you could actually
buy the computer that we set up from a
company using Braintree and if they had
just set it up they would not have to
pay any fees on that transaction but
what is Braintree exactly great question
it's code for easy online payments so if
you're building a mobile app for example
and you're searching for a simple
payment solution
check out Braintree with the V dot zero
SDK which is one small snippet of code
you can be all set up in less than 10
minutes and if that's too hard for you
they have support staff ready to walk
you through the process over the phone
if you need them their code supports
Android iOS and JavaScript clients and
they have SDKs in seven programming
languages they make it easy to offer
multiple mobile payment types including
PayPal Apple pay Bitcoin venmo Android
pay credit cards and more and more all
with this one simple integration all
you're going to do is head over to
Braintree payments go / - we've got that
linked in the video description and as I
mentioned before you get your first
fifty thousand dollars in transactions
fee free so thanks for watching guys and
if you dislike this video well you know
what to do but if you liked it then get
subscribed and maybe give a shout out to
our friends over at Puget systems in the
comments below they're actually nice pea
people even though you know this guy's
involved and anyway if you really like
the video hit that like button get
subscribed maybe even consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
today normally we say at Amazon but hey
not so much today because musics the
only one that builds that particular
system so we'll have that link in the
video description also listed in the
video description is our merch store
where you can buy cool shirts like this
one as well as our community forum which
you should totally join now if you're
done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so
check out our last episode of Holi where
we did an individual spotlight on that
$5000 graphics card including running
like DaVinci Resolve on it and stuff
like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
