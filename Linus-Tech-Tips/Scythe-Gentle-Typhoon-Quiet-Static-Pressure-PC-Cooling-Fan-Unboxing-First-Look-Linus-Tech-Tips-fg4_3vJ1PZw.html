gentle typhoon series of fans so these
are sort of more commonly known as
scythe GTS and they are very very very
well regarded on the interwebs so I am
led to believe
ok hyper cooling nano vibration
comfortable tone I think what they're
trying to say is that they cool really
well they don't vibrate very much and
they are not loud okay so the noise that
they make is is of a tonality that's not
very disruptive to your enjoyment of
using your computer they're available in
a variety of different rpms so we've got
a couple here today we've got the 1850
as well as the 1450 depending on what
you're trying to do so these are rated
for different airflow they're rated for
different decibels okay they both have
long life double ball-bearing 100,000
our rated bearings okay moving along to
the back overall dimension okay if
there's anything interesting here out
really they don't have a pressure rating
that's weird because one of the things
okay hold on hair characteristics
achieves high airflow volume and low
noise with the newly designed impeller
enabling silent cooling and the latest
devices which run very hot impending so
that means this and this design is like
more newer more better and more
different okay the gentle typhoon has a
different type of tone the fan propeller
is designed to reduce the disturbing
frequency fan noise to human ears so
reducing the frequency mean it's more of
a low hum instead of a high-pitched
whine the large scale motor and motor
support mechanism in the gentle techno
music - reduction structure okay the new
support mechanism uses coil dampers to
greatly reduce vibration time depending
okay so one of the things that is it's
always sort of you know weird to me its
high-end fans that have a very large hub
but you can see why scythe opted to do
that because the hub effectively reduces
the amount of cooling surface that you
have for the fan but if that was what
they had to do to reduce the vibration
and build a very high quality bearing
and motor and supports
sure then I guess that's what they had
to do uses an AI tech sir no okay okay I
think that's pretty much all there is to
say fairly bare-bones accessory package
so you've got a 4-pin molex to three pin
molex adapter you've got four screws and
that is pretty much it so we will be
using these to compare against Corsairs
brand new static pressure SP 120 fans on
a course RH 100 in a real system on the
NCIX tech cubes channel to find out once
and for all have Corsairs new fans
dethroned what was considered to be the
king of pressure fans because that is
what gentle typhoons are really well
known for on the forums is use on heat
sinks as well as use in scenarios that
require high static pressure so the
design of the blades allows it to
effectively push air through fins of
radiators and heat sinks restrictive
casing takes whatever the case may be
these can push air through them as
opposed to only being optimized for
free-flowing scenarios so we're gonna
find out which one does better on that
radiator don't forget to subscribe -
