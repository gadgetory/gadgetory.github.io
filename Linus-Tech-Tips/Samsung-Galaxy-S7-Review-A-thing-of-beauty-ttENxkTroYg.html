galaxy s7 in my hand was oh boy another
iterative update from a Korean mega
corporation how utterly uninteresting
but having spent the last couple of
weeks using the s7 as my daily driver I
can confidently say that there won't be
any spoilers here roll the intro
the Aria headphones from Phoenix come
complete with a cardioid clipped mic and
acoustic chambers constructed entirely
of Japanese pine wood click the link in
the video description to learn more as
dangerous as this may be to say in my
mind the s7 is about as good as we will
ever need from a quality of construction
standpoint which isn't to say we don't
need an active skew for the people who
throw their phones around I mean sure
with carbon-fiber next-generation glass
or other advanced materials slight
improvements could be made and will be
made to the overall fit and finish but
I've never understood for example
Apple's obsession with thinner and
lighter just because we can and
apparently neither does Samsung the s7
is unapologetically thicker and heavier
than the iPhone 6s and doesn't suffer
for it at all I mean the extra heft to
me makes it feel like a premium piece of
machinery and frankly I would make the
argument that the extra functionality
enabled by the thickness increase the
microSD expansion slot that's next to
the sim slot on the top the much larger
3000 milliamp hour battery and the
hardly noticeable bump over the
lightning-fast 12 megapixel optically
stabilized camera each individually make
up for that size and weight increase and
there are other things that I really
like about it as well can I be the first
to say I mean okay I'm probably not the
first but can I say it anyway that the
lock button and volume buttons are great
they're not directly opposing each other
so it's easy to press one side without
mashing on the other side and they're
big and clique enough that I can feel
them in my pocket but not accidentally
press them I mean I know I've harped on
this a lot in the past but it's because
it's a major annoyance for me and
Samsung has proven now that it's really
not that hard
Apple with that said it's not perfect
Samsung opted for a micro B USB port for
the bottom instead of a type C port
though this is somewhat more forgivable
thanks to the s7 s inclusion of wireless
charging to maintain compatibility with
the gear VR and still hasn't met
to deliver a speaker solution that
doesn't require me to cup my hands
around the bottom of the device or plug
in the three-and-a-half millimeter jack
also found there in order to hear
anything moving around to the front
we've got a 5.1 inch 2560 by 1440
Corning Gorilla Glass 4 topped AMOLED
display with a 5 megapixel F 1.7 selfie
camera that carries forward the s6 is
very solid low-light performance for a
front can and it's wide-angle lens the
latter is a big advantage if you're
trying to get a large group into a shot
with you in any sensible venue that's
banned selfie sticks without getting a
wicked case of a selfie arm here but the
flipside is I'm pretty sure this camera
makes my nose look big in terms of
inside guts the s7 represents the best
that Samsung can build and I'll explain
that asterisk in a moment so it's got 4
gigs of lpddr4 ram 32 or 64 gigs of
on-board storage with that microSD
expansion slot I mentioned before
although by the way it can only be used
as traditional mass storage no adoptable
storage in spite of the Android
marshmallow OS it's rock and umpteen
bajillion sensors including a barometer
and heart rate monitor fast charging for
its non removable 3000 milliamp hour
battery a significant capacity bump over
the s6 by the way and support for sexy
new wave to a/c wireless access points
with multi-user mimo which theoretically
means lightning fast Wi-Fi like the
iPhone 6s but in practice means still
fast but not as fast Wi-Fi this test was
done on asymmetric gigabit internet
connection now to the asterisk Samsung
is shipping two versions of the s7
either with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
CPU with an adrenal 530 GPU or an Exynos
88-90 CPU with a Mallee t8 ATM p12 GPU
depending on the region they are similar
in speed but different chipsets may have
different quirks when it comes to custom
ROM installation or even apps also
notable is the fact that the camera
sensor is being dual sourced similarly
to the s6 so you may get either a Sony
or
a Samsung sensor not by region this time
but rather it appears to be pure luck of
the draw which I guess leads us pretty
well to the camera discussion
I love the s7 s camera sure it's got
fewer megapixels than the s6 but they're
larger for better low-light performance
and I absolutely love the app it
launches nearly instantly with a
DoubleTap of the home button which if
you're trying to capture that cute
antics of kids or pets is half the
battle and autofocuses then snaps a
picture either with the on-screen
buttons or with the volume buttons or
even a metric whack of them in burst
mode by the way almost as fast photo and
video capture can be started from the
same window photos taken while recording
video are again lightning-fast and look
really good and unlike the iPhone 6s
that I was using with my roaming sim on
my recent trip to New York while
finishing up this review by the way the
s7 lets you under the hood with
downloadable and rearranged able camera
modes including a pro mode that allows
adjustments to white balance shutter
speed ISO focus and even a raw shooting
mode that should tickle shudder bugs
pink
while there are other phones with great
cameras out there
it's the usability that makes the s7
such a killer for me and now that all of
this extra stuff in samsung's camera app
actually works well rather than being
weird half-baked add-ons like they
always seems to be in the past I think
Apple finally needs to respond which
leads me to my thoughts on general
usability and the experience of
switching to the s7 as my daily driver
for the last couple of weeks TouchWiz is
in my mind officially a non-issue
whether we're talking about split screen
or they're integrated phone directory
service that attempts to help you filter
out useless spam the things that it adds
no longer hurt the Android experience in
my eyes and there isn't really much that
I care about that they take away
performance of the phone was without
fault
and while frequently switching between
it and the iPhone 6s on my recent trip I
never felt like I was
missing a beat which is high praise
indeed Snapdragon 810 s thermal issues
don't seem to have made another
appearance here with the s7 only losing
about 10 percent of its performance
after 10 minutes of continuous Geekbench
3 CPU benchmarks and it's not quite an
a9 but it's still very solid and the
screen while guilty of some
oversaturation managed some fantastic
usability from night time to broad
summer daylight if I had to give some
feedback to Samsung I would ask
respectfully that they give me the
choice to use on-screen buttons instead
of the hardware ones I find it hard to
hold devices with capacitive buttons
horizontally I bump back while reaching
to the far left of my keyboard when I'm
using it one-handed and I often find
myself mashing the home button while
taking the s7 out of my pocket remember
the headphone jack is on the bottom so
that's the part of the phone that you're
going to have to grab I'd also love to
while I'm giving feedback had the
fingerprint sensor on the lock button
instead of on the home button it's
amazing I never realized what a great
idea this was and so I started using the
Xperia z5 compact I'd like the lock
button to take me to the notification
screen and the home button to take me to
my main desktop when I have a smart lock
Bluetooth device connection and while
I'm at it
Motorola's ambient display where you can
actually interact and preview
notifications is much better than just
being able to see the time the date and
battery life but with all that feedback
in mind that's it I made it to the end
of almost every day with 30 percent
battery or more and the s7 was such a
pleasure to use that I found myself
browsing more taking more pictures and
taking more videos and this is without
mentioning that Samsung brought back
waterproofing so the s7 is a winner and
it's overthrown my previous king the z5
compact by merit of it's much faster and
better camera the only thing that the z5
still drives me crazy with even after
the marshmallow update so there it is
seven generations in you finally got me
Samsung you finally got me
and you know what else has got me a D
brand makers of the matte black vinyl
skin that was featured in the b-roll for
the galaxy s7 throughout this video and
not only looks good but also actually in
the case of this phone improves the
functionality of the device because I
was reading and watching other people's
reviews and everyone's going like oh
yeah yeah seven is so slippery ah ah
yeah not actually if you replace the
backing with that matte one or with one
of the carbon fiber ones of which I
actually have two examples here this is
a limited edition orange one they did a
while ago and here is the regular black
carbon fiber that they usually send us
Saudi brand skins in a nutshell they're
affordable they're easy to apply they
fit perfectly and they protect your
device from incidental scrapes and
scratches while making it look better
and you're not stuck with matte black or
carbon fiber or other carbon fiber you
can actually choose anything as you want
using their configurator and you can
even mix and match if you want something
different on the front or the back or
hey maybe you just want something
completely psychedelic they can do that
too so check them out at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
