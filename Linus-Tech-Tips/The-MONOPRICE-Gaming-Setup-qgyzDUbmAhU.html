one of our four members because people
like to watch stuff get thrown at you
so thanks stab your face for
recommending that we do the amazonbasics
thing again with monoprice stuffs to
have your face that's the username and
well know it's only two words it's stab
your face got it and what is this
look at that spoilers you'll find out
soon enough
and this model price gaming adventure is
brought to you by Tory blogs wellhouse
expecting you to same can't tell you
that's a spoiler two story blocks video
offers you studio quality stock video
clips for a fraction of the price check
them out at the link in the video
description
so the premise is pretty simple yet
again we basically went on a monoprice
shopping spree not because they paid us
or we even particularly like those guys
to be perfectly frank with you I don't
slide it too much oh it doesn't have a
thief feed on the bottoms of this thing
will screw up your desk Wow and
potentially your day cheese you've you
know you've as you get that so obviously
this is a dual monitor stand yeah if you
somehow want to put your dual monitor as
vertically okay so what are the specs of
this puppy this is a 2560 by 1440 P 144
Hertz freesync monitor 34 Hertz yes not
bad it also has some kind of quantum
dots and I tested the colors and they're
actually pretty good over 99% coverage
of srgb okay and how much did we pay for
one of these 400 bucks so this was the
$36 mechanical field keyboard yeah which
didn't impress us much yeah mush City so
it's a 10 keyless and it uses at Emma
brown switches how much do I pay for the
privilege of attending grounds two
dollars more than that one thirty-eight
dollars total and even though this one
has the double shot injected keys that
light can shine through
yeah it's there's no backlight it's not
RGB and this Amazon one is RGB did you
hear that backspace when I hit it the
key stabilization so bad Oh
I'd take this I'd give up my number pad
I'd give up my backlighting I'd give up
my macro keys but then I type more than
I game and when it comes to just lwas
being around back when I used to game a
lot
honestly I used to membrane keyboard
anyway so yeah but now you have taste
Wow
it doesn't have a forward button please
tell me this is programmable I felt a
lot of review thing it's not you know
what this thing sucks and I hate it one
thing it has is weight you can change
the weight although it says push it
actually means pull or push on this this
is actually a cylinder stack a little
weight tuning disc holy crap Brendan
check this out so my gut feeling on the
pixel response time motion blur look at
the trails behind the banner on the ltte
website as I move it around that is
disgusting Wow see that I thought it was
like an indoor parallax effect of the
website no that is horrendous ever seen
that in my life so that's what happens
when you take a panel that doesn't have
adequate pixel response times for the
refresh rate you're running and just
overclock the snot out of the refresh
rate the worst part we aren't even at
144 Hertz yet but this is one of those
examples of monitor specs being
misleading it's like yeah 140 40 Hertz
get your gaming gaming this is not gonna
be an amazing gaming experience what
keep at me hope right so their bread and
butter is cables yeah so here we have
healing so many mana price cables this
is a mana price DisplayPort cable and
way too much money this is an
amazonbasics DisplayPort cable
the monoprice one better be cheaper
because this is a really old housing
style with the the button lock this is
the one that we had already oh just buy
it we didn't just want to behold it
no remember how in the Amazon video
you're like why did you buy this we have
a million of these yes well now I see
how it was not necessarily better to do
it the other way thank you James for
illuminating that for me so there's two
types
this is the ultra slim one yeah that's
four feet for ten dollars and this one
is the premium one which is six feet for
650 bring me on this cheaper than ultra
slim right that's probably just good
because yeah this is cheaper to
manufacture or you can get a nice
braided wonderful Mavs on basics six
feet for eight dollars
I like this slim one really lightweight
and it actually makes no difference for
a digital signal to have a premium cable
that's thicker braided or whatever else
having this nice lightweight wire much
easier to manage super flexible - I like
this one mono price is actually fairly
well known for their headphones headsets
at least that's my understanding so
these are they're $90 active
noise-cancelling gaming headphones yeah
interesting let's have the unboxing
experience here my friends you can put
your nametag in here put like a business
card in there so somebody could wait
what they're actually a spot to put it
oh yeah there we go those are from this
side okay oh but you could take it out
if you want so if nothing else you've
got a hook and loop business card holder
even if the headphones are complete
garbage and you hate them so you've got
these inline controls and I like that
it's got that soft touch fish yeah they
would have done well to put this same
finish on the mouse these buttons are
very rudimentary buttons these are these
are cheap buttons so they're USB to
power the active noise canceling but
audio is actually handled via analog is
that correct so it looks like oh that's
an unfortunate position for the inline
control this thing is heavy
whoa these are clampy yes no length
adjustment on the microphone you know
what I actually kind of like the bit of
resistance to the articulation of the
ear cups though because it means that
they're not constantly like fighting you
and that active noise-cancelling is
basically just like someone going in
your ears you're trading HVAC for a hiss
well if you don't like the $90 premium
ones you'll love the thirty or I should
say $28 worst ones
oh wow these are these barely even have
padding in the top they're probably
better than what I was using for 28
bucks back when I was like first getting
into gaming but this is one of those
things where I'd really recommend saving
up or waiting for a Black Friday
promotion or something in our cheap
gaming headset roundup there were other
sets for twenty-five dollars that were
better they're done they're done I'm
giving these a recommendation over these
cuz for $90 you can get some pretty good
stuff whereas for like 30 bucks yeah you
can certainly get stuff that's a lot
better than this but like yeah I don't
recommend either none of what I just did
is should be construed as an endorsement
this is the mono price desk cover
modesty panel with wire management you
know your desk you're very privileged
there's a wall there but some people
might have you know other colleagues
desk cover modesty panels so you can man
spread without your privates exposed on
kilt date so what the idea is you hang
this off the back here desk with these
clips you actually screw this on to your
desk and then you just take your excess
cable and just like put it in your
pocket here well I think you've run it
in this way and there's these little
velcro that you could tie it in there
with
28 bucks 28 bucks yeah if it was me I'd
probably just get a tablecloth or like
would you believe it has no reviews on
Amazon I would personally I think it's
great if you're the type to stick your
boogers to the bottom side of your desk
David Ratcliffe how else can monoprice
improve my gaming experience today
Gaming I don't know but they have other
verticals that they specialize in like
smartphone stuff with their stitch line
Oh interesting what appears to be an
antenna switch droid Khan's so this is a
door window sensor when it gets opened
it'll make an audible beep but
apparently it's not that loud but in
addition you'll also get a notification
to your phone no matter where you are in
the world because it's Wi-Fi not just
Bluetooth so really today's theme is not
home security though and home automation
it's like your desk setup right so the
way that I see it you got something
really you know valuable in this drawer
here or something wait let's put
something valuable in that drawer yeah
so if I were to come in here and steal
yours hey oh there it is hey let's see
if I can get a tamper alarm pull off the
big one sure hey you tamper with my
stuff oh you are tampering nice that's
not a bad delay either bad boy I
probably should have given you this
earlier this is the monoprice 5 port
10/100/1000 megabit per second unmanaged
gigabit ethernet switch for $18.00
that's not even a great price actually
hey man it's got 5 ports even though the
product page says 8
and this has the fakest review ever it
says works great I love all monoprice
products I'd buy and they stand behind
the quality look I'm not saying I'm too
good to wear a headlamp I'm definitely
not too good to wear a headlamp I'm just
saying you got to have the top one
because these straps wear out and that's
what it'll actually hold it in place now
with that said this seems pretty alright
yeah so you can get a tp-link switch
with a metal housing for 14.99 with
prime this thing is done it's done it's
out its out it's done you don't blow you
just hum no another way other way why
don't the hell do they have this because
they sell music stuff I know you're
gonna do I show you I should have just
bought the 150 dollar guitar well I'll
be keeping that in my high-security
drawer lest anyone tried to steal it
from me that's a bargain to $8.26
although keep in mind 22% of people gave
it a one-star for not working at all
so for $65 i got us you know James I
think you're really stretching the
definition of desk accessories here what
are you talking about this is DIY phone
case dude I'm making a screen protector
right now I figure we're not
you're gonna vacuum seal your phone
alright where's the vacuum seal acumen
oh yeah baby
isn't this the vacuum er this is an
accessory hose
oh yeah he's pretty sealed I think you
just hit the release buttons now can you
use it oh yeah sure
let's see if my fingerprint sensor works
no hold on
no maybe fight okay nope no fingerprint
sensor let's try the iris scan come on
baby
can you work through that come on work
with me here no match can you please
keep your phone in there until the end
of the day but I can't use it can you
keep it in this your ranch oh no come on
please
no that's not me how am I supposed to
it's awesome looking good quick release
so overall then you know what I'm uh
actually kind of disappointed
so do you suppose I mean that you don't
think that Mona price is clearly better
than Amazon basics no I really don't
think I would say that at all I think
they come out ahead on the keyboard even
though these switches are really
inconsistent feeling but I just the
mouse isn't great the mouse pads alright
I think I'd have a pretty hard time
recommending this monitor
it's just nothing special stick the
cables monoprice yeah good cables
monoprice good cables and I mean this
thing seems alright to I guess you don't
know that speaking of seems alright our
