brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital better onboard graphics
is great for lots of things we can't
necessarily all agree on what it's
better for I mean some people might go
oh well I can use graphics cores and
OpenCL
to accelerate certain content creation
workloads that are more optimal on a
graphics core than they are in a CPU
core gamers might go oh well hey I can I
can you know play games like dota 2 or
League of Legends on my onboard graphics
rather than getting a dedicated graphics
card and then folks who just want to
enjoy media content playback might go
out well if my onboard graphics can
handle a couple consecutive 4k outputs
well hey that's great then I guess I
don't need a dedicated graphics card for
that but I think what we can all agree
on is that one of the best things about
onboard graphics is the fact that
they're tightly integrated with the CPU
which enables lower power to go along
with that high performance and even
lower heat output compared to a
dedicated discrete component so we are
on a voyage of discovery where we're
going to be traveling the show floor and
the Suites to find not necessarily as
many implementations of intel iris
series graphics as we can but definitely
the widest a variety that we can find so
there'll be like notebooks and
all-in-ones and even this thing whatever
this is stay tuned for that ok I'll tell
you it's a computer fits in my hand and
I'm a head ok it's not really good for
that now this isn't exactly what I had
in mind when I first heard about crystal
well or as it became iris pro graphics
but this is the Brix Pro from gigabyte
and it actually got a full lineup of
them but what I want to focus on is the
pro so there are two different ones
right here that are running a couple of
different configurations this one has an
Intel Core i7 4770k l' what this thing
looks like in my very small hands it
really is a handheld PC it's about like
2 knucks stacks together we have both
HDMI and mini DisplayPort out Gigabit
LAN super speed USB 3 on the back
on the front a Kensington lock and what
looks like a pretty beefy copper
heatsink inside it can accept both an EM
SATA SSD as well as a two and a half
inch hard drive but what's really
impressive about this is the fact that
this is battlefield 4 and I'd like to
take a moment and show you guys the
graphics options that we have running so
we were running battlefield 4 at 720p
medium details on motion blur off and
getting an acceptable gaming experience
on onboard Intel graphics that is a
first but the core i7 model isn't the
only option so this one right here uses
a 46 set off rather 4570 R it also has
the same expansion you can see we're
running a 4k video demo over HDMI yes
thank you so on this one we've got a 4k
demo running on a seiki TV and I guess
the if the objective is to show that
iris Pro can handle 4k video playback
without any difficulty then mission
accomplished one thing I wouldn't mind
checking out and this is something that
I didn't necessarily mention we were
going to do is I would love to see what
our CPU usage looks like while this is
going on yes friends we are looking at
about 29% CPU usage playing back 4k
video on a machine that can literally
fit in your pocket if your pockets are
very large in our quest for Intel iris
powered devices you might say that the
pickings have become whoop I almost
dropped it that would be bad a little
bit slim this is the Asus Zenbook ux301
la it is an extremely thin core i7 iris
powered ultrabook that features a 2560
by 1440 display and of course the
graphics horse power to back it up did I
mention it has iris in side on the back
it has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on the
inside somehow inside this tiny
enclosure they've packed USB 3
SuperSpeed micro HDMI more USB 3
SuperSpeed DisplayPort out an SD card
slot and of course well not of course
this doesn't this can't take this for
granted it's got up to 8 gigs of memory
and up to 512 gigs of RAM
zero SSD storage making this one fin
led-backlit sexy ultrabook iris powered
device oh sorry didn't see you there
guys I was too busy playing grid to on a
battery powered 21 inch all-in-one
that's running Intel onboard graphics
we're running at 1080p with medium
details it actually looks quite
excellent and this is the sony vaio tap
21 another unique iris design that we
haven't seen before it features a core
i7 45:58 you so that is a dual-core 4
thread core i7 processor this particular
one has 16 gigs of ram on it it's got a
1080p display it's got NFC and this is
the real kicker for me I mentioned it
briefly before but this thing is
battery-powered you can actually run for
a few hours away from wall power should
you so desire and on top of all that
it's actually quite slim so it's got a
nice aluminum backing here it's got a
full 10-point multi-touch touchscreen
and then it's got a gorgeous little
aluminum stand that allows you to adjust
your angle either up more vertical like
this as would be suitable for more like
desktop use or you know if the kids are
playing Angry Birds or whatever else you
can actually fold it down all the way
flat and use it as more of a tabletop
style display well display and full
computer this is the last stop on the
iris train here at the show this is the
CyberPower Zeus Hercules it features an
Intel Core i7 quad core 47 50 HQ so that
is pretty much ok it's like a mobile
workstation right so you can use the
quad core processor to do pretty much
whatever you want in terms of photo
editing or video editing you can use the
the video decode and video and code
features on the GPU so that is the iris
pro graphics for those applications as
well and all of that is within a very
very slim form factor now with that said
why don't we just sort of step aside
from the workstation thing for a minute
ok yeah it's got a 1080p display it
looks really great it's very portable
it's actually reasonably lightweight
when you consider what you can do with
it but let's talk about the gaming
capability of iris pro graphics ok CPUs
with iris Pro do consume a little bit
more power but remember guys you don't
then need to add a dedicated graphics
chip in order to get acceptable
performance now I've got a friend over
at Intel who is kind of telling me okay
yeah iris / you're looking at 30 40
percent better than iris but what does
that mean in real life what it means in
real life is that they've actually used
this very notebook to run professional
tournaments with thousands and thousands
of people watching them without anybody
ever actually realizing so this is a
Starcraft 2 1v1 that they were running
off of a notebook with integrated
graphics so I hope this whole showcase
where we've got all in ones with
batteries we've got gaming notebooks
that don't have dedicated graphics chips
we've got little tiny
PCs that can hook up and play 4k video I
hope this has given you guys some
perspective on the variations that can
be achieved
variations why did I even say that I was
doing really well until like I
completely jumped off the train of how
well that video was going anyway I'm not
going to worry too much about it maybe I
was just like too too dazzled by all
that variety that we just saw I needed
to come up with a new variety of word to
describe it anyway guys that's pretty
much it for our Irish showcase here at
CES 2014 like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it as always
don't forget to subscribe and the last
thing I'd like to ask you guys is out of
all the different form factors we saw
which one is your favorite in this video
just leave a comment under the video and
let us know</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
