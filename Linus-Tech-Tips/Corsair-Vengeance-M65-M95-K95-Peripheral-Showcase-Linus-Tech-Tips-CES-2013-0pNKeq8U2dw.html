2013 where we have a whole bunch of new
peripheral stuff to show you guys
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys
so the m90 and the m60 are being
replaced by the m95 and the m60 five so
as before the 9 9 X Maus is the MMO
centric Mouse and the six sort of and
whatever else it is Maus is the FPS
oriented Mouse so you've got those same
features we saw before
things like MMO optimized macro
programmable buttons all over the m95
we've got two more up here and your dpi
sniping button right here on the left of
the m60 as well as your back and forward
and your dpi adjustments up here the
changes that have been made are more
subtle than you might have expected so
every button on the side of this mouse
has now been fine-tuned in terms of the
force required to trigger it they're all
actually different now no rattle but a
bunch of changes this is a an
evolutionary change that was necessary
because some people were finding it you
know it's hard to please everyone some
people find it too stiff some people
find it not stiff enough so Corsair
feels that now they've got this dead
zone in the middle that allows you to
lift the mouse and the buttons should be
a little bit easier to trigger
especially up here versus how they were
before and I actually my feedback so far
is very very positive because it is
easier to feel your way around and
easier to find the correct buttons you
want to trigger they're also available
in a variety of finishes now check this
out so m95 comes in black just like the
m90 it also comes in a bright
stormtrooper white so you can see it's
glossy here but unlike the iqari laser
white edition which i found i wanted to
love it I really did but it was
obnoxious because the sides were
slippery glossy plastic as well they've
gone with a matte finish here in the
dead zone and here for your pinky rest
so what that means is you can still lift
the thing without actually just having
it fall out of your hands so that's a
great move from Corsair right there the
m60 5 is available in three finishes so
you got that black that stormtrooper
white again matte on the side so you can
actually lift the thing and a military
green style that should be a big hit for
the FPS users running vengeance see 70
cases say for example if you wanted a
totally matching themed Corsair build go
for it and get yourself one of these
they've also upgraded
sensor so it's using the latest 8200 dpi
laser sensor for the most precision
possible personally I you know don't
really crank up the DPI on the last I'm
using a multi-monitor setup but for you
multi monitor gamers out there you're
gonna love that next we've got actually
it's just a small upgrade to the
Vengeance 1500 and 2000 they've got
Dolby now so don't worry guys if you're
an existing Vengeance headset user and
you've got a 1500 or 2000 you're gonna
go ahead and you're gonna download that
update you're gonna enjoy that effect no
big deal you don't have to buy anything
new
they're also introducing the nm 600
mouse mat so we've seen some cloth pads
already from Corsair this is a hard pad
it's reversible evidently so there's a
rough surface on this side that's got a
plain black finish and then there's a
smoother surface on here that has kind
of a crisis II lookin hexagon pattern
thing that looks very very very sharp as
well this however over here is the piece
de resistance as far as the demos go
this is the K 95 now the K 60 and the K
90 are not going away the K 95 is going
to be positioned above those ones but it
has some really cool features that
gamers have demanded number one and it's
in addition to the three sets of macro
profiles macro recording mode brightness
adjustment has three levels now all
right now I don't have three levels
before a brightness adjustment you can
lock the windows key media keys all that
good stuff check this out Cherry MX Reds
all over the freakin place now so the
entire keyboard if it's a key that moves
it has a cherry MX red switch under it
it also has an individual backlight also
you guys are gonna love this - check
this out when you trigger a key you can
actually toggle which back lights you
want on so you could turn off the whole
thing and write your name in your
keyboard check this out well I don't
know if I'm gonna make it all the way
through my whole name here but I think
you guys get the point
you can also customize which keys are on
and which keys are off in various
application
using the coarser gaming software when
you're done customizing it you decide
this is exactly how you want your
keyboard to look you hit the button
again and now you can use your keyboard
as you normally would very cool stuff
