product it is the retro bit retro gen
retro product retro unboxing today so as
you may or may not be able to tell by
the name of a product this is a retro
product which is not to say it as an old
product it is a new product but it is
designed for you to play old Sega
Genesis games so this is a handheld
console and let's go over a couple brief
features before we open up the box here
first of all you've got AV out so that
means you can run your old games on your
new TV should you desire it but one
thing to be aware of is that you can't
use an additional controller so you're
going to be looking at single-player
games only it is cartridge compatible
and something that I should mention is
that these guys are talking about
releasing a developer cartridge that
would allow you to use an SD slot to run
like homebrew games or develop your own
stuff very cool feature next you've got
a lithium ion battery and it is USB
enabled now this but wait there's more
262 color graphics and 2.8 inch color
LCD screen now I've actually I'm being a
little bit ironic here but the facetious
sorry not ironic but the 2.8 inch color
LCD screen from my understanding is
actually quite excellent so we will find
that out I may have to do a gameplay
video later if the batteries are not
charged but let's get this thing open so
first of all we have a piece of foam
okay and there you go there's there's
not a whole lot of leading up to it
there that's it that is the retro gen so
it comes with this snowboarder sticker
so let's peel that off and have a look
at the screen itself so I'm actually
gonna get up and get a better position
here so I can start to show how you hold
it but you've got a d-pad over on the
Left feels ok it's a little bit spongy
feeling and it seems like you won't be
able to sort of know which direction
you're pressing but actually it's it's
quite it feels quite nice on your thumb
you've got a reset button up here start
button over on the right-hand side of
the unit and then you've got a B C X Y Z
for your buttons for your left thumb and
those actually feel pretty good as well
it's easy to hit ah I'd say all of them
actually are quite well positioned for
your thumb so up on the top of the unit
you've got hmm I guess one of these is
the AV out and one
of them is going to be the headphone
jack this is probably the headphone jack
because here is your volume control that
was pretty straightforward you've got a
little knot here where you can attach a
wrist strap and then you've got a USB
port on the bottom now Oh down here is
your on/off switch so you can see that
labeled right there it is off right now
and oh that's kind of hard to press but
should be okay and I don't know what
this one does but I'm gonna just flick
it just for fun okay on the back you can
see this past the QC test excellent
that's very good and then right there
that's where the magic happens so that's
where you insert the Sega Genesis
cartridge so now let's get a little bit
further into the box here and find out
what else we have so there's a little
paper protective thing and then there's
a oh okay oh there's a manual the Quick
Start Guide kind of thing so this tells
you what all of the different buttons
are so we can find out what that one on
the bottom is cuz I'm curious now oh it
switches it between pal and ntsc so
depending whether the game is designed
for one format or the other you can
actually switch it that's pretty cool
okay so then how do you turn off the
game play okay so this one side it is
pretty straightforward there's not a
whole lot of substance there but it
should help you if you're having trouble
getting started with your retro gen here
we have a USB a two mini B cable so
that's for charging the unit and then
here's your AV out so it's oh that's a
mono audio out so you've got your video
and mono audio it does not support
stereo out via this method so in theory
we should be able to turn this thing on
if it has a charge there's our power
indicator and it's on so it comes with a
few pre-loaded games jubal magic curling
2010 Mays 2010 awesome why don't we turn
it off and I will grab a game so in my
tickle Tron here I have a few classic
Sega Genesis games including World
Series baseball Michael Jackson's
Moonwalker and toejam and Earl in panic
on funkotron naturally we are gonna go
with Michael Jackson okay
and let's get that in there and see I
just want to see how the screen looks
and demonstrate that so we've loaded the
cartridge in you can see it sticks up a
little bit off the back you can see the
label there so let's turn this baby on
and there we go so it's booting up and
let's have a look at how that screen
looks the power is on on the bottom do I
have to press Start we have sound but no
video at this time okay well we might
have to do a separate video to show the
screen playback but thank you for
checking out my video blog on the
unboxing of the retro Gen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
