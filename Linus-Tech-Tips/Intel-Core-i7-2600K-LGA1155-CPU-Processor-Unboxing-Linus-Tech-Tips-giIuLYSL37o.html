unboxing of the Intel Core i7 2670
processor on the LGA 1155 platform so
I'm going to tell you what it has going
for it in relation to the other core i7s
on the LGA 1155 look at the thing on the
LGA 1155 socket as soon as I escaped
over here to go show you all of the
other Intel Core i7 products that I have
to unbox before this day is through ok
so here is the 2600 k it is a quad core
just like all of the others here now
here are the advantages it has over the
other products it has an 8 meg just like
the other 2600 that is an i7 but the i5
s only have a 6 Meg cache ok
it has turbo mode which all of these
processors do they all have turbo boost
but the core i3 s do not it has
hyper-threading which the i5 s do not so
both the 2600 K and the 2600 have hyper
threading and then the 2600 k also is
unlocked so that means that you can
overclock it as high as possible with a
P 67 or Z 68 motherboard using
multiplier adjustments to turn up the
clock speed and there are no limits so
here I guess they're going to say pretty
much everything I just said it also
includes the HD graphics 3000 engine has
smart cache technology integrated memory
controller which we know supports dual
channel ddr3 and it has a three year
limited warranty like pretty much every
Intel processor in the last little while
so these are the codename Sandy Bridge
family of processors and this one comes
clocked at 3.4 gigahertz by default but
that's kind of deceptive because turbo
mode which works on every motherboard
will actually turn up the clock speed of
this processor up to four speed bins
higher than that that is up to 3.8
gigahertz if you are using a
single-threaded
app
location pretty cool huh okay so inside
the box we find new eco-friendly
cardboard packaging from Intel the first
thing we see is a stock heatsink which
looks exactly the same as the stock
heats things we found on the LGA 1156
family of processors because it is the
same it uses the same mounting hole same
fan same heatsink design and a copper
slug in the middle very nice and then
once I figure out how honored to open
this aha there we go Darth Vader mask
style of opening I can dig it so this is
the 2600 K itself as I mentioned before
this is a fully fledged Intel Sandy
Bridge 1155 chip that means it has turbo
tech turbo turbo boost technology it has
hyper-threading technology it is clocked
the highest out of all of the LGA 1155
core series processors and it is fully
unlocked for maximum overclocking now it
looks very similar to an 11 56 CPU but
the difference is that these keys here
these notches in the side are positioned
differently so that you cannot
accidentally install it in an LGA 1155
motherboard so thank you for checking
out my unboxing and overview of the i7
20 602 Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other technology
videos also check out on my NCIX palm
channel the overclocking guide for this
particular CPU and I will try to
remember to put in an annotation with
the link to that but if not then someone
please leave a comment so people can
find it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
