points of going with a PC gaming setup
instead of buying a console has been
support for running games at a higher
resolution with 4k being the latest
woman in the red dress
but no more console gamers are finally
getting their first taste of the 4k
experience with the Xbox one s a console
that upscales 1080p games to 4k but what
if you want your console to natively
render games in 4k like a PC Sony
advertises dynamic 4k gaming and 4k
entertainment asterisk and native 4k on
pro but what does that little star mean
let's find out
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to Tritonal

video description like the Xbox one s
the ps4 pro isn't part of a new
generation of consoles as it largely
resembles the base model of the
PlayStation 4 with only a few key
differences aside from just being larger
and packing an extra USB port most
notably the GPU or graphics processor
has been seriously overhauled with 36
Radeon compute units twice as many as
the original along with a 111 megahertz
increase on the graphics clock combine
that with a 500 megahertz increase on
the CPU and 24% greater memory bandwidth
sony has certainly given themselves some
room to play with when it comes to
increasing performance there's also an
hdmi 2.0 port as opposed to the hdmi 1.0
port on the base model so it's pretty
clear sony is targeting users with 4k
displays and the addition of hdmi 2.0
isn't just a gimmick as the ps4 pro does
feature some titles that will run at 4k
60 frames per second mind you these are
either older or less graphically
demanding games the HDMI 2.0 port also
supports high dynamic range with the HDR
10 standard so even if not everything
runs 60fps you'll get richer colors and
more accurate black levels for better
detailing if you have a compatible TV
and you're playing a supported game or
watching supported streaming video
content but how does it work well older
games like Skyrim will just natively
render at 4k they don't need to do
anything else but many newer titles will
use techniques like dynamic scaling
where frames are rendered at some
resolution between Full HD and 4k even
depending on the scene within the single
game then they're up scaled - well 4k
then there's what's called checkerboard
rendering which only renders half the
pixels on a 4k display the way
checkerboarding works is that it renders
pixels in a diagonal pattern instead of
leaving out entire vertical lines this
makes it easier at least in theory for
the system to get
at the missing pixels resulting in
sharper images and better anti-aliasing
than traditional upscaling but does it
really what's the best way to find out
we initially thought about doing a more
traditional video with screen captures
but with YouTube video compression being
what it is and us not even having a
compatible hdmi 2.0 capture card anyway
which is important as the ps4 refuses to
push even a 4k at 30 Hertz signal over
an HDMI 1.4 connection we decided to do
something a bit different and more
real-world
remember the Pepsi challenge from the
1990s now when I pick this up and tell
me which one you chose well instead of
doing a blind taste test between Pepsi
and Coke we set up three identical
monitors side-by-side and let some of
our team members tell us which system
they preferred a ps4 Pro running at 4k a
base ps4 running at 1080p and a PC
running at 4k with an Rx 480 which we
chose because it can handle 4k at
reasonable settings and frame rates and
a value minded 4k gamer might be able to
afford it with the money he or she saved
on a PlayStation Network subscription
Colton Linus and Tyler we're our guinea
pigs in the ps4 Pro challenge in which
they played rise of the Tomb Raider and
Skyrim on each of the three systems
recording their thoughts in between we
chose these games due to their different
rendering methods
rise of the Tomb Raider uses
checkerboard rendering to accomplish 4k
upscaling while Skyrim runs 4k natively
so what did our participants prefer well
let's find out alright so I think a is
the PlayStation 4 plus B I think B is
the PC okay and I think C is the ps4 Pro
okay you'd be correct thank you but I
thought the PlayStation 4 well looking
comparison to PC was like terrible just
terrible I was like hey wow yes I I did
get my guesses right Mike holtam said it
was a lot harder to tell in Tomb Raider
it's a very well optimised game so
framerate dips were much less noticeable
ps4 pro and ps4 texture quality wise
look
similar to me oh I couldn't really tell
a difference it was mostly in the
sharpness of the image that I could tell
the difference between the two Skyrim on
the other hand the PlayStation 4 is a
dog in Skyrim there's obvious framerate
dips when you pan the camera around ps4
was probably dipping down to like 22
frames per second when I was panning the
camera around ps4 Pro held steady at 30
like I could really tell that that
cinematic shutter was consistent at the
very least but the PC was obviously
running at 60 to 90 frames per second
with really low frame times you actually
got um your guests 100% wrong in Tomb
Raider I thought for sure that a was the
PS pro mm-hm that B was the PC and that
C was the PlayStation okay so you got
the two versions of PlayStation mixed up
yeah Oh what about sky and then on
Skyrim it was really hard I could still
I was still pretty confident that C was
the PlayStation but it was hard for me
to tell between a and B when I was when
I was playing Tomb Raider on this I kind
of felt like okay like this is this one
doesn't have as great graphics is the
other ones but it's still we're still a
good game experience sure like I could
sit down and play it and not be really
pulled out of it where's when I played
Skyrim months on see I kind of like if
I'd sat down to just play that I
probably would have felt upset at the
graphics so it looks like our results
depended a fair bit on what game was
being played for a closer look here are
the 4k screenshots from the ps4 Pro as
well as our PC running rise the Tomb
Raider at high and very high presets
texture quality between the ps4 Pro and
the PC on high is quite similar though
the PC does a better job with foliage
shadows water effects and color while
very high far outstrips both with much
more articulated textures and shadows
but what if you're like me and you don't
own a 4k TV well in this case the ps4 is
definitely a tougher sell but that
doesn't mean that Sony totally forgot
about gamers who are rocking a mere
1080p display a number of ps4 titles are
super sampled on the pro this means that
they're rendered at a higher resolution
like 4k and then scaled down to fit a
1080p screen one such game is the affer
mentioned skyrim and the ps4 pro super
sampling makes
big difference here both of these
screenshots are 1080p but you can see
the big difference in texture detail on
a ps4 pro versus the base model in this
scene with the ground the wooden steps
and planks the tree branch in the top
left and the grass roof all looking much
nicer on the ps4 pro but unfortunately
these games don't support the ps4 pros
much ballyhooed high dynamic range or
HDR capabilities which is supposed to
give gamers more accurate colors and
more detail in bright and dark areas of
the screen so we connected our ps4 Pro
to Linus's LG signature OLED 4k TV with
full HDR 10 support which you can learn
more about in our review right up here
and fired up Deus Ex mankind divided one
of a handful of ps4 titles with HDR
support unfortunately it's not really
possible to screen capture HDR content
properly and directly but we were able
to snap these shots from the Dubai level
this room is quite dark without HDR but
with it turned on you can definitely see
more detail in the darkest parts of the
image such as in the sand the equipment
in the lower left and the far wall on
the right side while the image quality
isn't at the same level you could get on
a PC HDR definitely makes the scene pop
more and speaking of popping should you
be popping the ps4 pro into your living
room setup this holiday season well at
$400 it's definitely a little more than
a lot of folks are used to paying for a
new console these days it's $100 more
than Microsoft's mid-cycle refresh of
the Xbox one s and that's without 4k
blu-ray support a perplexing and
frustrating omission but to the
discerning eye it gets us closer to PC
quality 4k than has ever been possible
on a console before and that's really
cool the rumors of its melting death
seemed to have been greatly exaggerated
and while the price is higher it's still
a pretty solid value if you have a ps4 I
probably wouldn't upgrade if you have a
4k TV and no ps4 and you want something
really easy
to plug into it and get a really solid
4k experience might be a solid option
