the course are each 70 so here it is the
course are age 70 and I'm going to unbox
it so let's start with the cpu
compatibility you can see that right on
the front it is compatible with LGA 775
11 56 and 1366 and it also comes with
mounting hardware for a M 2 and an 3 so
it's compatible with every socket out
there that matters right now they've got
a nice little graph on the back that
shows how it dramatically outperformed
your CPU stock heatsink and I can tell
you this they don't have this on their
graph but they should because it's
probably going to be quieter than your
stock heatsink especially under load so
here on the side we've got the fall
specs
you've got the radiator dimensions which
is 120 by 150 2 by 48 millimeters
you've got your fan specifications here
so 50 261 CFM at 26 to 31 point 5
decibels so it's not super quiet but
it's not that loud either and I mean
really when you want maximum performance
out of a CPU cooler you sometimes have
to make compromises as far as quietness
goes so I'm just gonna try and figure
out how the box opens exactly before I
start cutting away at the shrink-wrap
here so I'm gonna cut there I'm gonna
cut here I've had quite a few questions
about my new knife yes it is a Spyderco
knife I don't know exactly which one it
is but there's their little logo so I
think this is gonna come up yes look
another little each Stephanie logo there
of course there really is good at
packaging I'll give them that
so they've managed to take the H 70
which is a slightly bigger because it
has an extra fan in it cooler it's a
better performing cooler than the age 50
and they put it in a smaller box
it's like brilliant so here's a little
Corsair solutions guide they show you
their memory cooling power supplies
chassis and then on the other side you
got flash and storage with SSDs they
really do have a very complete lineup
these days it wasn't that long ago that
they just have ran basically so they
want you to deal with their tech support
ok and instead of getting in touch with
the store they have a QuickStart guide
here which shows you
how to set up the 870 and only seven
easy steps so maybe we'll refer to this
a little bit as we talk about the extent
me here's the AMD mounting hardware okay
so it's a little mounting ring thing
I'll have a look at this one we actually
see it here 775 so this shows you the
parts you need for LGA 775 here is 1156
and here is 1366 so they show you which
holes to use on the back plate and then
how to configure it to to go in the
right place on the hold-down clip on the
says age 50 on it not that's okay we
understood what they meant we know it
works for the age 72 okay so here we've
got a couple of little adapters because
it has two fans you might want to use
one of these so this way you can plug
two fans into your CPU fan header so you
can see one of them just has power and
the other one has power as well as an
RPM monitor so that means that your fan
header on your motherboard will pick up
the RPMs from the one fan but it'll
provide the same power to both fans so
that way you can get all the information
you need in power two fans in one fell
swoop here are your little silencing
adapters so you can throw those on there
if you want the whole thing to run just
a little bit quieter than it otherwise
would have so there you go you plug
those in like that and then you plug
your fans into those so the whole thing
comes off your motherboard like that I
love how everything Corsair does is
black so you got black wires black
connectors blacks leaving very nice okay
next we have all of our mounting
hardware here we go so this is a back
eight for 775 11 56 and 1366 you see
they've got the three different holes
and they've got them all helpfully
labeled for which sockets you want to
use next we have aha all the little
pieces of hardware that those diagrams
were for so you put those through the
Intel mounting plate okay in the way
that is demonstrated on that on that
helpful sheet and then you put your
little your little foamy sticky bits on
the back of the back plate which go here
alright and then you put the little pegs
which are finally here these little
silver guys through the back of the back
plate screw the whole thing together
shouldn't take
longer than about eight minutes that's
my estimation
here's your a.m. oh no this is not ambi
Mountain Hardwear this is fan mounting
hardware and then I guess AMD mounting
hardware is also in there but you can
see there's a course our back plate as
well as an AMD hold down for the h7d or
age 50 I guess this would also work with
based on how it works work just fine
Friday give all of our fan mounting
hardware so we've got washers and screws
and those screws will bolt the fans on
to the radiator which is the biggest
improvement on the age 70 this radiator
is very thick compared to the age 50 the
age 50 is probably about this thick and
the H 70 is this thick now cooling is
not rocket science
I mean Rockets need to be cooled don't
get me wrong so there is cooling
involved in rocket science but cooling
isn't rocket science
more surface area is better so Corsair
instead of opting to increase the size
of the radiator this way so you can have
like a dual 120 millimeters 120
millimeter slim radiator Corsair has
instead decided to go with a thicker
radiator maintain that 120 millimeter
compatible mount so that you can mount
it in most cases but still get more fins
in here more surface area and thus
better cooling now one of the
disadvantages of having a nice tight fin
structure like this and a thick radiator
is that it's highly resistant to air
being pulled through it if you can't
push or pull air efficiently through the
radiator it's not going to cool very
well so that's why Corsair has
implemented a push-pull system so that
means when you mount the h7t in the back
of your case you will mount it like this
Corsair recommends you draw fresh air in
from the outside although you can
configure it either way but you'll have
the one fan blowing fresh air through
the radiator from the outside and then
you'll have the other fan configured on
the other side drawing that fresh air
through the rad and then blowing it into
the case so you see it's configured with
one pushing air through and one pulling
air through two fans so it ends up quite
thick you're going to want to make sure
you have enough clearance in your case
to have something this large from the
back of your case so it's going to maybe
stick over your sea
you sock it a little bit but of course
they're thought of that too and this is
what's so clever because it's so thick
it might have you might have had issues
with the original h50 CPU block pump
unit clearing it now they have a nice
low-profile
870 CPU block and pump so it's got
pre-applied thermal paste and from my
testing with the 850 this stuff is
really good so there's no need to
replace that with an aftermarket paste
on your first first installation once
you've used it then you should clean it
off and put on a new paste but you can
see that the aged 50 is probably about
this tall with the and then maybe even a
little bit more once you have the tubing
sticking out of it but the H 70 is only
about wow that's about an inch and
change tall and then they've got the
tubing coming out at a bit of an angle
here and these are actually flexible
look at that so you can mount this in
like the smallest smallest profile
possible like this so you can actually
have the tubing coming out at an angle
like that so you can mount it almost
under anything and the pump is powered
by just a three pin fan connector so you
could plug that into just like a system
fan plug and you'd be on your way it's
got a nice little Corsair shiny badge on
the front of it and I think that pretty
much concludes my unboxing of the
Corsair h 70 thank you for checking it
