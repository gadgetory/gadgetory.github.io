the Linksys wrt54g router which loses
claims and i believe them is the
top-selling router all of all time
earned its legendary status by being a
solid piece of hardware with great
support from the open-source community
who built firmwares for it that
performed better were more stable and
added features that especially at the
time were only available on expensive
commercial grade routers now we have
finally got its spiritual successor the
wrt 1900 a C in our hands but making a
video about it right now puts me in a
bit of an awkward position
two months ago I could have gotten on
the hype train and said oMG Linksys is
going back to their roots it's super
powerful hardware they're going to
collaborate with the open-source
communities could be awesome and by two
months from now
links this might have completely
smoothed out their relationship with the
makers of popular third-party firmwares
like open wrt and dd-wrt and that
message might be completely valid again
but right now is an in-between stage
where the hardware is available but none
of the big aftermarket firmware guys
have announced any kind of timeline for
support for this router with most of the
communication from these communities
being fairly critical of links this is
collaborative effort so far and they're
using by Marvel Wireless chipset rather
than a more widely supported Broadcom
chipset but there's good news if you ask
Linksys there's a ton of work being done
behind the scenes to get support rolled
out in a timely manner so stay tuned for
the time being though all I can say is
what you're getting now when you buy
what is one of the most expensive
consumer routers on the market
physically the unit is a real throwback
to the old wrt series with a black and
blue look and stackable design that will
look very familiar to fans of the old
wrt54g on the bottom we find tons of
installation holes and rubber feet that
include wall mounting support a nice
touch the front is mostly taken up by
the usual indicator LEDs for
connectivity and activity on the sides
we find two of the four included antenna
which are not internal or permanently
attached a baffling trend that plagued
us for a couple of years and now
thankfully seems to be going away so you
can easily upgrade these if you want
moving around to the back we've got five
gigabit ethernet ports one of which is
designated for when a WPS button a power
switch a power and jack a thankfully
easy to reach Hardware reset button huge
thumbs up there and a couple of storage
ports that appear to be labeled
similarly to internal SATA connectors as
ports zero to three except that there
are only two of them further
investigation reveals that the right one
is a USB 2.0 / eSATA combo port labeled
USB one and the left one is a USB 3
superspeed port labeled USB 2 funnily
enough for all the marketing around
Wireless speeds and all the cryptic
labeling of these ports these are
actually one of the biggest
differentiating points for this router
and they're capable of throughput in the
60 to 70 megabyte per second range on
eSATA and USB 3 numbers that put this
router cleanly in the mix with dedicated
nas hardware in terms of drive
performance finally on the back to more
removable antennas bring our total to 4
although I should be noted that the
router supports three spatial streams so
only the most optimal of these three
will function at any given time finally
on the top we find shiny prominent
Linksys branding I guess they're happy
to be out from under the Cisco umbrella
and more ventilation holes over a
temperature controlled cooling fan that
didn't even turn on throughout my
testing but will ramp up under extremely
heavy load and the largest heatsink I
have ever seen on a router I mean
seriously that is one big ol hunk of
metal down there feature wise things are
a little bit light for a premium router
with no VPN support and fairly limited
options in terms of parental and
advanced wireless controls but Linksys
does support both a wireless repeater
mode and bridge mode although I wasn't
able to test these since I've only got
one of these at the moment the software
setup process is pretty straightforward
overall Linksys includes a password on
the Wi-Fi out-of-the-box thank you by
the way and both their easy setup wizard
and advanced UI will be very familiar if
you've used any links this last couple
of generations smart routers it's pretty
snappy but a feature that I was sad to
see missing from my older EA 4200 nan
I would connect router is the ability to
apply almost all changes without
restarting the hardware that was
freaking awesome for a trial-and-error
network configuration guy like me but I
suspect for most people it's not really
that big of an issue now on to
performance well unfortunately I can't
replicate the assortment of routers used
for comparative analysis and the
well-established test procedures that
Tim Higgins at small net builder comm
used for his review of this router which
you should definitely check out by the
way it's linked in the video description
what I can do is run it through the
paces by testing both 2.4 gigahertz and
5 gigahertz speeds on my Dell XPS 12
with an upgraded Intel 31 60 AC wireless
network card to give you guys an idea of
how satisfying the experiences overall
the router was installed on one side of
the main floor of a three-story house
and my 4 test locations were right next
to it with no obstructions about 10 feet
away directly upstairs through the floor
upstairs on the other side of the house
in the land showroom and finally through
to exterior walls
in the garage where it's really nice to
have decent Wi-Fi connectivity for like
if you're working on a project or
something you want to have a movie to
watch or whatever the case may be for
the measurements I used i per with the
following arguments which gave me
consistent results but I would
definitely be open to suggestions about
how to improve our results in the future
I'd also love to hear from you guys if
you'd like us to do more wireless
networking videos we really haven't done
almost anything ever and if we did then
we might have actually something to
compare against in the future so post
your thoughts in the forum 5 linked in
the video description if you'd like to
see more of this category from us or if
you just can't be bothered so conclusion
time the wrt54g was revolutionary
because it delivered stable and for the
time very powerful hardware with a user
flashable firmware it captured the
hearts of the modding and enthusiast
communities with a variety of
third-party firmware is available for it
that enabled features that at the time
could not be found in routers at that
price point and that's the big gap I see
in the new strategy the 54 G was very
competitively priced I mean I mentioned
the price twice just now which drove
widespread adoption which if there's
anything I've learned about the
open-source community it's that they
want their work to be enjoyed by as many
people as possible
drove that open-source development that
created a pretty amazing positive
feedback loop as that open-source
development drove more sales of the
router and I think that's something that
without that inexpensive factor is going
to be challenging for something so
expensive to achieve especially with
competitors like the Zeus rtac 68 you
and Netgear are 7,000 available for so
much less with similar performance
albeit without the impressively beefy
build quality so that's where we sit
right now is the WR T 1900 a C a capable
platform that given adequate support
could compete for your hard-earned money
the answer is yes but whatever links
this might wish it is going to have to
relearn that legendary status because
their competitors have had over a decade
to catch up to the concept of great
hardware with support for open firmware
and there are plenty of other great
options for modders many of which are
ready to go now and not waiting on
future firmware changes so I want to
hear from you guys in the comments is it
too little too late for the wrt 1900 a C
or do you think this is just the tip of
the iceberg and Linksys is going to
build on what a little bird might have
told me already is a very successful
product hmm anyway guys thank you very
much for watching my team and I worked
hard on this video we hope you enjoyed
it if you did please like and share it
if you didn't please dislike it and
leave a comment with your thoughts we do
take constructive criticism very
seriously also linked in the video
