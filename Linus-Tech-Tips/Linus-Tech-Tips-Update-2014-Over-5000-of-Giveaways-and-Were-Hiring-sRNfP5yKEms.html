28th the last thing item number three in
our 2014 update is really important for
us to achieve the aggressive goals we've
set up for ourselves this year which is
more content with better quality across
more channels we will need people space
equipment and all kinds of expensive
stuff like that and for that we will
need your help we've had a lot of people
ask us over the years if we take
donations or contributions many con many
content creators do and with a couple of
exceptions we've always said no but now
there is we've worked out an easy
automated system through Linus tech tips
comm that cuts out the middlemen who are
keeping a chunk of your contribution for
themselves and it pretty much all goes
to us except a little bit excuse me a
little bit to PayPal Square choked on
that paper so visit the contribution
link in the video description if you
like what we do and you want us to keep
doing it honestly the benefits for the
different tiers aren't really that
different and because we're never going
to charge for access to any of our
content there's really no pressure and
the amount that you contribute is
completely up to you or if you do it at
all it's completely up to you just know
that every dollar helps us do what we're
doing and do it better and you have our
thanks and if you do want to contribute
but you don't want to bother creating a
form account don't worry we have
you covered as well the forum now
supports signing in with Twitter
Facebook and steam so you can just
quickly easily create well just sign in
that's pretty much all there is to it
and I think there must be one other
thing because otherwise I don't know why
you're even here other than to mock me
so I'm I'm leaving and I'll let you
cover update item number four so update
item number four which in my opinion
doesn't necessarily matter more or less
than the other ones but apparently he
doesn't care as much is the lightest
tek-tips conglomerate which is currently
the eighth largest faction organization
thing in all of star citizen we just
passed a red faction aka reddit faction
which was actually really cool that we
do love those guys and once we get 100
more members we will be third in the
world in terms of size which is actually
pretty epic our activity levels are
pretty insane as well as we're ranked
number one or two we kind of bounce back
and forth for activity which is really
interesting the chat is super active and
on the forum we post a ton I think about
like 27 pages right now so whether or
not you're in the organization if you
just want to talk about start is's and
come visit us on the forum we can talk
there I have a ton of fun things planned
for the alpha and beta stages of star
citizen as well so if you are planning
on playing star system just want people
to fly with it'll be a lot of fun join
up casuals and hardcores are both
equally welcome as well as just
everybody else well I have something to
do for everybody I'm sure the hardcore
is will stick in there kind of little
groups and we'll play within themselves
and get a lot done and I'm sure the
casuals will just have a great time
doing up today else they will constantly
play with themselves but join up today

awesome as always subscribe and thank
