many people have asked me to unbox this
the a sous rampage 3 Black Edition
motherboard so this is part of their
Republic of gamers brand this is an ex
58 that is an LGA 1366 motherboard
supports core i7 extreme score sevens
nvidia sli and ati crossfire i think
they mean AMD crossfire but the badge
has yet to be updated let's go around to
the back where we will find a couple of
things first there's an ROG Thunderbolt
so that appears to be bad enough
something's it looks like a sound card
so we'll get a little bit into that
looks like it has external power so
that's gonna have a headphone amp on it
we've got Bluetooth v 3.0 okay we've got
ROG Connect which is their their
overclocking feature which allows you to
use another computer to plug into here
and then alter overclocking settings as
well as extreme engine digi+ which is
their vrm solution alright everything
else on here on the back is pretty
straightforward so why don't we go ahead
and have a look at what is presumably a
window into the future of motherboards
there's the Thunderbolt look at that
powered by Oxnard
I mean zonar sorry sorry umm so we'll
look at that more later but let's have a
look at what's in here so first of all
we have a built-in headphone out aha
sound greater yeah will sound greater
with a headphone amp guarantee umm what
it's what else do we have here ok so it
looks like some sort of processing chip
ok that's good we have a dedicated end
PU so that's a killer e 2100 dedicate
really is not a faulty 2100 Wow cool ok
so there you go you got a PCIe 1x uh
killer killer dick alright
extreme engine DIGI+ ok analog and
digital design elements combined for
power
ok ROG connect we've already covered
that bluetooth 3.0 so the first and
Wi-Fi enjoyment new technology lifestyle
excellence free antivirus and that's
pretty much Han so let's start opening
this thing up I'm actually excited about
this
because I did not even know that this
product existed until I had like 300
billion requests to unbox it all over my
channel or my inbox I even had some guy
email me it's like okay don't know you
got my email but like thank you for
requesting an unboxing in it I'll see
what I can do okay here we are
sooo lots of accessories look at this so
we have a couple of Wi-Fi antennas I
remember these I had one of these with
my AAA 10:32 SLI deluxe I think that's
around the time they started shipping
these these Wi-Fi antennas with onboard
Wi-Fi on their motherboards and they
stopped doing it for a while all right
we've got a USB USB 2.0 and eSATA PCI
bracket got a little chipset fan which
probably sounds horrible don't recommend
using that in all likelihood okay we've
got an extension cable for USB okay Oh
or or on board or front panel audio
maybe I don't know I don't know what
this is for okay next we've got some
SATA 3 cables which are exactly the same
as the 6 SATA 2 cables so that's 2 SATA
3 6 SATA 2 cables except for the color
okay we've got the ROG connect USB cable
for all these back in here
there we are we've got a 3-way SLI
bridge we have a two-way SLI bridge we
have a crossfire bridge ok we have their
cute connector which is for the front
panel connectors as well as one USB 2.0
header make it a little easier to plug
in we've got some zip ties we have an
i/o shield some temperature probes a
user guide around page three blackish
that's a heavy user guy that's like
thick look at that okay and then we have
a an Intel chipset and support DVD as
well as a republic of gamers sticker
throw away the DVD there mmm look at
this audio precision test report
Thunderbolt powered by
our success disclaimer the information
and contents contained in the
something-something okay so basically
they're just showing it's really good
cool thanks guys okay then we got a big
old case sticker and let's go ahead and
put that back - all right motherboard
time okay Thunderbolt why don't we do
the Thunderbolt a little bit later
actually give me two seconds here guys
all right so if we're gonna have a look
at the Thunderbolt powered by zone our
first so this is a PCIe 1x combo card it
includes not only the land port but also
the zone our aspects which are the sound
aspects of the very high-end land and
sound solution that comes with this
board so you've got a spit if out you've
also got a line out and a line in okay
moving around we've got a matte black
PCB and you can see right on the back
here you've got rampage 3 Black Edition
as well as your serial number
information all on there okay we've also
got front audio out which is right here
and at the back of the card we've got a
USB connection which is evidently what
that little USB extension cable was for
and then we've also got a molex power
connector so that is going to provide
power to the amplified audio out port
alright let's have a look at the
motherboard itself so the first thing I
notice about it three guesses guys matte
black PCB love it anything with a matte
black PCB could be in my system no
problem because matte plaque PCBs look
awesome next thing I notice about this
board is it has a non-standard layout it
is slightly wider than an ATX spec an
ATX board would normally end right about
here okay this one is just a little bit
wide so you don't need additional
mounting holes you don't need an e ATX
case but you will need is a little bit
more width on the edge of your mother
or tray in order to install this board
so you can see it's only one two three
four five six seven in Lincoln in length
or in height so its standard ATX height
but it's a little bit bit wide alright
so let's start at the CPU socket right
in the middle because that's a good
place to start as I mentioned before
that is an LGA 1366 socket so that has
full support for all the core i7
extremes core i7s on the LGA 1366
platform here we've got the PWM which
includes a very very slick looking
cooler okay so there you go there's some
kind of NEC splash token talking tokine
however you pronounce that chip here as
well as eight phases of their digi+ PWM
actually hold on bear with me a moment
yes eight plus three phase power so what
that means is we've got eight
higher-quality phases as opposed to
putting a ton of lower quality phases on
this particular motherboard that is the
root as Zeus has decided to go moving
over here we've got support for triple
channel memory up to six dims so it uses
a Seuss's easy slots so that means you
only have to actually fasten the clip on
the one side you just slide it in to one
side put it in and then you push the
clip in like this we've got a post LED
indicator so that'll give you post codes
right there we have start and reset
switches on board we've also got voltage
check point all down here so we've got a
couple grounds we've got CPU CPU PLL qpi
io h io h PCIe IC h IC h PCIe and ram so
that's actually more voltage check
points than i've seen on I think any
other board here are the PCIe 16x
switches so you can actually use these
to easily diagnose video cards this is
this feature there have been times when
I would have pretty much done anything
for this feature because when you
install don't turn the camera sideways
like that when you install a couple of
video cards in there and you know they
got full cover liquid cooling blocks on
them and you're trying to figure out
okay
you have a video problem is the is the
bottom car dead the easiest way to find
out would be to go like this turn off
your top slot boom all of a sudden
that's your primary PCIe slot now you
can find out if that cards dead or if
it's something else that's wrong with
your system so it's great for for
troubleshooting we've also got this
button which is for making sure that the
system will post 100% no problem with
the any memory no matter what the spec
is 24-pin power here we've got also a
USB 3.0 front panel header so you can
use that on any new case that supports a
USB 3.0 USB 3.0 front ports via a header
we've also got storage here so we've got
6 say 2 to 3 gigabit per second as well
as to say 2 3 6 gigabit per second ports
we've got a pretty sweet-looking
Southbridge heatsink which has a sous
branding on it it's got kind of a matte
black finish the entire board almost as
black other than a couple little red
accents which look really good dual BIOS
right here you can see we've got two
dedicated BIOS chips a couple front USB
ports oh yeah front panel switches as
well as a BIOS clear switch right here
there's a ton of 4 pin PWM fan
connectors I'll count them in a minute
but this just seems to be a ton on this
board we've got a molex easy plug here
so that's if you're loading this up with
graphics cards you might need to provide
some exhilarate our to prevent your 24
pin connector from burning out from
providing all that juice all through the
board oK we've got a front audio
connector on the motherboard itself as
well using X by two supreme effects so
if you don't want to use the Thunderbolt
card you still have pretty decent
onboard audio which is kind of cool ok
so that's your that's that you also have
pretty decent onboard Ethernet so
they're using the Intel Ethernet as
opposed to a third-party chip for the
onboard Ethernet as well if you don't
want to use the killer 2100 that comes
on the Thunderbolt card so let's have a
look at what we've got yeah I promised
to count the 4 pin PWM fan connectors l1
more other thing that I haven't shown
yet to is it has two PCIe 8-pin
connectors
Oh PCIe - CPU EPS 8 pin connectors up
here so you're going to need to access
those from the top probably one of them
is optional but providing both will give
you potentially more current to the CPU
sockets we've got one two three four
just zoom out so you can see where these
are four five six seven eight eight four
pin pwm fan connectors all over this
motherboard craziness oh yeah here's
where that fan goes on the Northbridge
heatsink so that's where I mentioned
there was a red accent there so you can
bolt that fan on there get a little bit
of additional cooling if you are using
water cooling or some other kind of
cooling that doesn't provide any
incidental airflow to the Northbridge
hietzing all right so let's have a look
at the back where we will find our
bluetooth 3.0 as well as wireless LAN
802 one one b/g/n there's also another
reset switch up here that's a very
peculiar place for it alright and an
additional one here kidding me oh yeah
okay there's a clear CMOS switch there
okay we've got one of those ps2 mouse
keyboard combo ports we have one two
three four five six USB 2.0 ports here
on the back we have two USB 3.0 ports
two eSATA ports we have our ROG connect
button as well as the USB port for that
the Intel n that I mentioned before as
well as the creative x-fi to supreme FX
sound that I mentioned before so this is
a decked out motherboard there is no
doubt about it
we've also got some additional heatsink
re going on on the back here for the PWM
as well as the standard LGA 1366
backplate all of the heat sinks on the
front are attached via screws which is
nice because they can't come out like
push pins also means if you need to take
them off and put them back on you don't
risk damaging the push pins making it
impossible thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the rampage 3 Black Edition
from the soos don't forget to subscribe
to Lions tech tips from our unboxing 3ds
and other computer videos so I did have
to Artyom for a couple of these things
first of all there is an ln2 mode jumper
over here and that Allah
with the hue reset button over here
which actually stops power to the CPU to
allow you to recover from a non posting
state when you are using liquid nitrogen
is some of the extreme overclocking
features that we have on this here
particular board there's also a jumper
for a load line calibration on the qpi
okay we also have whoops we also
clarified what this guy down here does
this is a BIOS switch so you can
actually switch between these two BIOS
chips here on the board and I think
that's pretty much all we wanted to
cover here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
