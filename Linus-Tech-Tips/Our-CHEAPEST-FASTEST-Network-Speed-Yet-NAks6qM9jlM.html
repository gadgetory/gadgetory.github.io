transferring in just a few seconds what
if I told you it was between two
separate machines and then what if I
told you we did it for less than $100
worth of news parts off eBay and less
than an hour of tweaking within Windows
well it's true and you could do it too
I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
gaming laptops feature Intel 7th
generation Core i7 processors check them
out at the link below our jerk excuse me
our journey began when I spotted a post
on the line of tech tips forum where a
user was showing off a local networking
setup that boasted speeds three to four
times higher than the one that we used
in our guide to 10x in your network
speed on a budget and at a lower price
using second hand enterprise networking
gear called InfiniBand so I sprung into
action drafting an email to Jake that
went something like hey this looks
really cool
but I'm super busy can you figure out
what the junk is going on with this and
he was like okay this looks pretty
simple I order the cards in the post and
a queue SFP copper direct-attached cable
plug them in it's off to the races right
wrong the quad data rate or QD are 40
gigabit InfiniBand cards we got off eBay
were made by two logic a company that
was acquired by Intel who doesn't
provide windows drivers and while
showing these speeds on Linux would have
been really cool the majority of our
audience runs Windows so round two point
we began with high hopes for the MHRA H
- a - XS are even though we couldn't
find it on melon oxes website only to
have them jab by an inaccurate product
listing the second one we bought is a
double data rate card and I've been
informed that 20 gigabit transfer speeds
are so last week Lewis I not to be
dissuaded from spending my money by the
first two unsuccessful attempts Jake
ordered a third pair of InfiniBand
adapters Mellanox MH q h1 9b - XT rs4
25 bucks each and a 5 meter or 15 foot
cue SFP copper direct-attached cable for
30 bucks
putting our total cost at $80 and deal
under 150 for a much longer link with a
45 foot cable running you about 90 US
dollars the cards are PCI Express Gen 2
and should fit in any reasonably modern
computer so install then in Windows
Device Manager you should see Mellanox
connect x2 IPO IB adapter if they don't
show up then install the window F
archived version 4.95 then update it to
5.10 for the most stable results
theoretically this will update your
cards to the latest firmware but if it
didn't we will have a blog post on the
ltte forum that outlines the detailed
steps for forcing this manually as well
as some other details about the process
check it out below with the cards
recognized
we have functioning InfiniBand Nix but
no subnet manager which assigns an ID to
the next and creates a routing table
based off of that so effectively then
there's no way for them to receive or
send anything since one of the most
likely use cases for something like this
would be a high-speed FMB or I scuzzy
server and a preferred client somewhere
else on the network we opted to install
open SM on the test bench representing
our file server again you can find the
full details in the blog post we're
getting close to the end now we need to
assign IP addresses to our InfiniBand
adapters but since they can't be used to
communicate with the other Ethernet and
Wi-Fi devices on our network we want to
put them on a separate subnet and keep
our normal Ethernet plugs plugged into
the motherboard so if your home network
is 192.168.0.1 thing then you could go
with 192.168.1 got something let
say 24-hour server and 21 for our game
machine almost there except the new
network popup on both machines run a
quick ping test to make sure they can
see each other then to ensure that the
higher speed link is used when
transferring data between the two
machines adjust their priority by
changing automatic metric to some number
we chose 24-hour onboard Ethernet and 10
for our InfiniBand and bam you should
have a 40 gigabit link so please note it
will show up as 32 gig event due to 810
encoding and all that's missing now is
some kind of drive that can actually
saturate that kind of a connection
fortunately we still have those 16 gigs
fix of Dominator Platinum that we were
supposed to send back to coarser but
then our PRF left and didn't tell
anybody and our buds over at sauce
perfect hooked us up with their RAM disk
software seven gigabytes per second
anybody unfortunately on consumer
versions of Windows we didn't see quite
the results we were hoping for Layton
sees were still super low which makes
sense since InfiniBand is an enterprise
technology intended for storage area
networks but we capped out at about one
gigabyte per second for our maximum
bandwidth file transfer tests similar to
10 Gigabit Ethernet so what gives well
the answer is our DMA on Windows Server
or Linux we could expect much better
perhaps a follow up later let us know in
the comments if you'd like to see that
either way we're polices punch with the
results because compared to 10 Gigabit
Ethernet we do lose the interoperability
with other ethernet gear but we gain the
same transfer speeds as long as all
we're looking for is point-to-point and
a whole lot of money to put back into
our wallet so this is an interesting one
we've got today this is the tma-2
modular headphone
system from I I I it lets you create
your own headphones providing a vast
range of interchangeable options through
their configurator you can change the
headband you can change the speaker
units you can change the ear pads and
even the cables although that last one
is sort of more normal everything else
though is like freaking crazy there's
over a thousand different total
combinations that you can build
depending on whether they're for
everyday youth DJing studio recording or
you want something that's really light
and portable and not just that they can
be taken back apart and recombined with
add-on parts that you can get down the
road if for whatever reason you want to
change up the experience so check out
their configurator at the link in the
video description and build your own
today so thanks for watching guys this
like or a like get subscribed maybe
check out the link to where to buy the
stuff we featured in the video
description also down there is our merch
store way to buy cool shirts and posters
and all that kind of stuff as well as
our community forum which you should
totally join now that you're done doing
all that stuff check out this latest
video over on Oh actually I don't know
what videos we're featuring now so check
out a video it'll it'll show up or
something</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
