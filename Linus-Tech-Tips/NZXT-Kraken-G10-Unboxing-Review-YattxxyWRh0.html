time that NZXT has really blown me away
with an inexpensive product that just
makes the lives of system builders
easier so the first one was their little
USB internal header hub that allowed you
to add additional headers if you didn't
have enough on your motherboard this was
back in the days when most boards had
like two or even one internal header the
second one was the grid which is a
little fan power hub that allows you to
simplify your cable management and
simplify your fan speed management and
the third is this what this does is it
takes your existing there's many of them
on the market asa tech based liquid
cooler a cpu liquid cooler and allows
you to mount it to your graphics card
effectively water cooling your video
card but at a fraction of the cost of
what it would what it would cost you to
go with a full custom liquid cooling
solution for your card which is really
the only other option out there for a
video card water cooling inside the
excellent but completely unnecessary
soft closed cell foam packaging I mean
none of the stuff is a fragile or
anything we find the bracket itself
which is available in black white and
red we find a backplate that has a
variety of different mounting holes we
also find a variety of mounting hardware
to go through it we find a 92 millimeter
fan which actually just screws on to the
bracket itself and then blows air
directly at the back of the video card
where the vrm and actually some of the
memory typically are in order to make
sure that the card doesn't run overly
warm and finally we find an instruction
manual with some included zip ties this
is a nice touch just because you know
cable management is never a bad thing so
why would you want to liquid cool your
graphics card well number one is it
gives you something to do with your you
know your old ace attack CPU liquid
cooler that you're not using anymore
because frankly they're just not that
great for CPU cooling CPUs kick out a
lot more heat than GPUs overall number
two is the fact that GPUs genuinely
perform better if you're able to keep
them running cooler GPU boost 2.0 and
AMD's latest power tune will actually
turn up the frequency of your graphics
card higher if you are able to keep it
cooler now the only things to watch out
for here are things like k scan
Pat ability you're going to have to have
positions in the case for fan mounts
that are either 120 millimeter 90
millimeter like the H 90 from Corsair as
well as the kraken X 40 from NZXT and
you're going to have to have ample
tubing lengths to reach your graphics
card the last thing to watch out for is
that just because a fan fits somewhere
doesn't mean that you're actually going
to be able to screw a radiator in there
sometimes screwdriver clearance is going
to be more of an issue for you than the
actual fan clearance so NZXT has some
compatibility charts for cases a lot of
their cases are compatible with it so go
check that out the other thing that they
have compatibility lists for is coolers
now you'd expect NZXT to just say oh
well it's compatible with the crack in
this and the crack in that no they're
not they're coming out they're saying
look here's all the coolers from all the
brands that will work with our product
go nuts use someone else's cooler with
that and I think that's very cool of
them and then card compatibility is
being updated constantly but it's
compatible with like the latest stuff
because of its very modular design so
gtx 780 780ti titan 292 90 x all of
these are supported you can check out
NZXT site for some you know updates in
the future about that so without further
ado let's get this baby installed in
something we're going to take a crack at
the Radeon r9 290 and see how much
better it can perform with our normal
standard overclock so just letting it
ramp up as high as it can with better
cooling versus the stock cooler
installing the g10 really wasn't that
bad it's pretty daunting when you first
look at it because it's very new and
when I first started strapping it to the
card I was kind of getting frustrated
but when I stopped trying to align the
words properly due to my OCD I found it
actually to be fairly easy if you
there's there's a specific way you're
supposed to have the tubes going they're
supposed to be kind of aligned near the
top of the card so they can be routed
more easily and I was trying to have
them turn towards the fan which doesn't
really work just because of how the name
would have been aligned up performance
wise the graphs pretty much say it all
we saw this coming with an R 90 to 90 we
knew that water cooling it would help a
lot because it got so freakin hot so
once we strap a water cooler on it like
we just did we knew we would see
improvements like this but it's still
kind of surprising to see how much it
improved I can tell you right now even
though it's not on the graph
our 780 benchmarks which used to be
above the r9 290 are now below once it's
water-cooled although that's not
entirely fair because the 780 isn't
water-cooled itself well we're back to
me you guys here we're going to cheat a
little bit we unfortunately didn't have
time to install it in an actual case so
we just ran it on the test bench but if
you want to see what it looks like in a
case here's some footage of the last
time we were in NZXT suite and we were
actually checking this out with not one
but two cracking G tens installed in a
single chassis so yes guys it is SLI and
crossfire compatible as long as you have
adequate spacing between your PCI
Express slots and you don't need a ton
of additional expansion cards so what is
there left to say about it well it makes
your graphics card perform better
whether you're overclocking or not in
many cases because stuff like the r9
290x and the r9 290 actually throttle a
fair bit even at stock speeds it makes
your graphics card run cooler which will
lead to better life and it's relatively
inexpensive especially if you have an
older liquid cooling unit just kind of
lying around already even a 120
millimeter liquid cooler although I
prefer 140 millimeter is going to be
more than adequate for cooling something
like a GPU so this is a fantastic
product at a low price and I think it's
fantastic thank you for checking out
this video like it if you liked it
dislike it if you just liked it leave a
comment if you have feelings that just
can't be expressed by thumbs up or
thumbs down and finally don't forget to
