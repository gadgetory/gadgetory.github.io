extreme computers on the planet around
here like the upcoming part two of our
oil submerged cooled PC build log thing
that will be showing off make sure you
you're subscribed for that but I think
we forget that some of the most
interesting computers today don't have
processors made by Intel or AMD aren't
powerful enough to solve the economic
crisis and don't require as much power
to run as a clothes dryer today's
computer by contrast with the oil cool
thing is this tiny battery-powered
affair that may not be able to tackle
global issues but it can let you fly a
paper airplane around with your
smartphone which is also pretty cool the
cooler master Neptune 240m features an
exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more the unboxing experience was
actually pretty fun because you get a
wack ton of stuff tailor toys includes
the wireless strap-on motor module
itself a micro USB cable and 1000
milliamp hour battery bank for folding
templates although you can print your
own later one water-resistant Tyvek da
Vinci style template for the Nakamura
model plane spares for the propeller and
rudder and finally the user manual
something you will need the module
itself may not really look like anything
special but there's actually a ton of
Technology inside at the rears a
propeller on a variable speed motor and
a rudder that you'll control later by
tilting your phone left and right
following the lightweight carbon-fiber
stem towards the front will find the
processor battery 55 meter range
bluetooth module with antenna power
switch and microUSB charging port that
are all protected by a sweet transparent
housing that clips on to the front of
the plane nice and tight like so and
features a soft foam nose to protect it
during crashes now setup might be a
little bit intimidating for some people
when they see the 48 page 1 language
yeah it's all one language user manual
but since the battery takes 20 minutes
to fill anyway throw it on the charger
and then spend half an hour reading the
documentation once folding two templates
for the beginner invader plane and the
more advanced Nakamura install the app
on your phone watch a couple of their
tutorial videos some of which are great
and some of which are surprisingly
unprofessional like the one where the
host sneezes in the middle of folding
the plane and they don't even bother to
cut it out and then you will be ready to
head to the park and give it a whirl I'd
recommend bringing the manual with you
for your first few flights because there
are some details particularly with
respect to the initial fine-tuning of
your paper airplane that you might want
to refer back to but the gist is you do
a test flight with the motor off make
sure it goes straight another test
flight with the motor on at around 60%
more if it's a windy day although I'd
recommend going out on a day that has as
little wind as possible and then as long
as both of those are satisfactory
straight flights then you're ready to
rock and let me tell you this thing kind
of well rocks even though it was windy
or out then I would have light which
made gaining altitude kind of tough for
us both my cameraman and I this was our
new guy Buerkle shooting this by the way
had a total blast flying this thing
around in the first few test flights
that we did we weren't able to achieve
the level of performance that the
manufacturer shows off in their
promotional video but even as an
inexperienced you know aircraft builder
and pilot I was able to have a ton of
fun and the more success we had the more
improvements we made the more I wanted
to keep trying so that I could get that
level of performance out of it because I
think it's very doable you just I think
the key to having a great experience
with this toy is just experimentation if
you just want instant success out of the
box and you don't feel like working on
your plane between crashes to get solid
performance out of it then this product
might not be for you but if you're a
tinkerer by nature and you're looking
for something you know interactive and
engaging to do know I don't know by
yourself or with your kids or even with
your buddies it's worth every penny
you'll have a blast back to boring
review stuff again I guess range is as
advertised so is battery life and the
Android I
apps both worked great for us with an
experience Ickx a little guys
double-check your phone for
compatibility because it does use
bluetooth smart or whatever so you have
to have a newer bluetooth chipset on
your phone
but overall I think tailor toys did a
great job of delivering what they said
they would I do still think there are
some things that could improve though I
mean I would love to see a beefed-up
version with a more powerful motor
and/or a bigger battery for longer
flights I mean I hope they continue to
invest our energy resources into this
idea because I think it's really cool
but I also think the out-of-the-box
experience could be a bit better the
manual is excellent but their site
navigation is poor and so is the
organization of their tutorial videos on
their YouTube channel which made things
a little bit more difficult for me as a
novice user than they needed to be I
mean here's here's a couple of examples
they don't have any letter size
templates for letter size plane designs
even though they refer to them and say
you can build them so if you're in one
of those backward countries that doesn't
normally use a4 printer paper then
you'll have to go obtain some somewhere
there's also the completely unnecessary
add a zero dollar template download
thing to your shopping cart and then
check out on their site in order to even
fold more planes on your own and get the
templates so that that was kind of
annoying but I mean I guess there there
is good news they do have these cool
Tyvek DaVinci templates I grabbed a 10
pack of them when I back to the
Kickstarter so it's not all bad and
really these are all minor complaints I
think overall the conclusion should be
this the powerup 3.0 is a great gift
idea for a son nephew coworker uncle or
female version of any of the above
who loves little electronic gadgets and
paper airplanes by the way guys
