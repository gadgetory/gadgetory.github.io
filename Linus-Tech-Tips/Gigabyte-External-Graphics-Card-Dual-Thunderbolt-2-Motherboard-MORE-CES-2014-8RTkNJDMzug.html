brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital we're here in gigabytes
showcase where there happens to be an
overclocking event going on over there
but the thing that I'm actually
interested in is right here now guys
this is as prototype as prototype can be
it doesn't even have a name they're just
calling it bricks gaming and expander
card and this is clearly not a card it
also has like mini SAS HD cables
connecting one of their bricks Pro
little tiny pcs to this massive external
box so this is just like Frankenstein
together it's totally like it
it probably won't even use these cables
it might even use Thunderbolt or USB 3
or something like that but what this is
you guys is an external box that allows
you to expand the graphics capability of
whatever machine you happen to connect
it to now they're planning to hopefully
bring something more finished to
Computex but right now there's a bunch
of different ideas so number one is this
mini SAS connectivity that has this PC
which is otherwise running an AMD Radeon
85 50g it has it running a gtx titan
alright so imma let that sink in for a
moment gtx titan now obviously you need
the special connector right now they're
also looking at other solutions like
this is a regular desktop and they're
thinking maybe you could add like a PCI
Express 16x card that goes out to a box
that maybe supports more than one GPU
like right now these ones if you have a
have a look at the end here have a
single GTX Titan graphics card in them
and that is it but the power supply in
here is actually 600 Watts in this
prototype so it could potentially
support two cards in SLI or we could be
looking at expansion for other things
maybe high end video capture cards or
whatever else the case may be and it can
cut could get to the point okay guys
where you have your Ultrabook you carry
that around with you you sit down at
home you've got a core i7 inside it or
whatever really decent CPU you plug it
into your Brix whatever they call this
thing and all of a sudden you have a
fully fledged gaming rig running off of
your notebook
now probably a good third of gigabytes
presence here is all about their bricks
lineup so they have regular bricks they
have bricks Pro and they have something
that caught my fancy which is bricks max
this is an AZ solution slash server
slash I don't even know what you want to
call it but it has a core i5 4250 you
inside and check this out you guys for
two and a half inch hard drives in
something that is small enough that I
can hold it up with a couple of fingers
so you've got Gigabit LAN you've also
got USB 3.0 HDMI out it's a fully
functioning system that also happens to
be able to support four by one terabyte
hard drives you can see there are
individual hard drive activity LEDs on
the front of the unit and I think it is
pretty freakin cool looking it actually
doesn't even run that hot they had it
powered up just a moment ago now the
regular bricks are sort of your your
small compact machines and then bricks
Pro actually comes in a variety of
different configurations including ones
with Intel processors AMD processors
GeForce dedicated graphics Radeon
dedicated graphics and of course one of
the stars of the show which is the iris
pro model that they've got running both
battlefield 4 and 4k video playback here
at the show just with onboard graphics
now of course gigabytes not all about
systems and notebooks yes we do have an
exciting new motherboard to show you
guys here this is the GAC 87 X duty 7 th
and the th is of course for threesome
because this one will get you laid so
fast that you won't know actually that's
not what it's for its for thunderbolt
now gigabyte has already had thunderbolt
motherboards in the past including ones
with dual thunderbolt ports just like
this one has but what they've never
shown us before is dual thunderbolt 2 so
each of these Thunderbolt ports is
capable of 20 gigabit per second just
like the new Mac Pro except unlike the
new Mac Pro you can throw a bunch of PCI
Express cards in for expansion you've
got high end onboard audio you've got
built-in liquid cooling as well
Zehra cooling so it's gonna be well
cooled regardless it's got all the v
checkpoints you could possibly want as
well as onboard buttons for overclocking
and all of those things that PC
enthusiasts love now this one right here
I actually don't know what that is in
between those two PCI Express slots and
they won't tell me but I'm sure given
that they won't tell me that that's very
very exciting closing out the gigabyte
Suite we have the not gigabyte no this
is a new brand a premium brand and Oris
brand this is the x7 notebook which is
an extremely slim core i7 quad core
notebook with a glass trackpad fully
backlit keyboard programmable macro keys
on the side it also has dual geforce gtx
760 5 ms 1080p non TN panel and most
importantly it doesn't run too hot and
it doesn't run too heavy or too thick
this is an extremely slim extremely cool
gaming notebook we actually have a full
unboxing and overview of it also
available on the channel so definitely
check that out
but one thing we weren't able to do
during that video was show that it can
actually game at 4k so they've got a
couple demos here one with it running at
4k one with it outputting over its two
HDMI ports and it's single DisplayPort
port to three monitors running Nvidia
surround yes friends off a notebook it's
running Batman Arkham origins at 3 by
1080p at normal details and the minimum
fps and the benchmark built into the
game was 44 frames per second guys don't
miss any of our CES 2014 coverage
remember we are powered here at the show
by NCI XCOM your source for great
technology selection and service in
addition to a Western Digital and
courser memory thanks so much to all
those folks for letting us be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
