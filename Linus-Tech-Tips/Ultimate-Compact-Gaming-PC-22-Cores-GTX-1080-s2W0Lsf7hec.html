compact gaming PC the original of which
you can check out up there but unlike
most sequels which are like bigger and
better this one is going to be smaller
but still better we are going to be
packing a 22 core CPU 64 gigs of RAM
a 700 watt power supply and a GTX 1080
all into a case about the size of a
shoebox
intel skull Canyon Nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 you can learn more at the
link in the video description the
motherboard was a very carefully
considered component for this build the
epc 612 d 4i that was generously
provided by as rock rack the server and
workstation arm of asrock is one of the
only two mini ITX motherboards capable
of housing this CPU the other one is
actually made by a zurich consumer and
while I gave up an MDOT to slot for a
PCIe SSD along with Wi-Fi onboard audio
and really much i/o at all
I kept the essentials like USB 3 and a
PCIe 16x slot for the graphics card and
what I gained is something that I had
never seen before quad channel RAM on an
ITX board but before we get into that
let's talk CPU this is the bee's knees
the cat's pajamas the Kobayashi's Meru
Intel's Xeon e5 $26.99 v4 a four
thousand dollar 22 core 44 thread
monster that boasts 55 Meg's of cash
more than my first computer had RAM it
runs anywhere from two point two to
three point six gigahertz using turbo
boost 2.0 technology and supports the
quad channel ddr4 memory that I
mentioned previously speaking of which
we're using some pretty badass ram here
a data makes the only qualified 16 gig
ECC so dim ram for this motherboard so
as a reminder this is ECC server memory
in a sodium or usually notebook form
factor and they were kind enough to
provide us with four sticks of it so we
could have 64 gigs of quad-channel ddr4
ram running at 21 33 megahertz in our
build something that would have been
impossible with full-sized imps
though even with half-length memory
sticks there is not a lot of room left
for the CPU socket and the cooler that
goes on it
we chose the Dyna Tron t3 18 full copper
vapor chamber cooler on the advice of
Dan cases because the EPC 612 d4 I like
its consumer-oriented brother has a
narrow aisle and mounting hole layout
meaning that there are not a lot of
options
since the t3 18 doesn't include a fan I
pilfered a Noctua NF a 9 X 14 from
another cooler that we had on hand but
you can buy that fan separately and set
to work building a mounting system for
it oh my god with borrowed wire hold
downs and an angle grinder you can mount
the fan with zip ties but this is a
little bit more elegant and it ended up
working perfectly for thermal compound
regular viewers will probably notice I'm
using quite a bit more than usual here
the reason for that is that the $26.99 v
force heat spreader is really big and
additionally that died under it the
actual processing part of the processor
that outputs heat is much larger than a
typical CPU meaning that the heat
transfer area is much larger now Luke
demonstrate it and you can check that
video out in the corner there that in a
large case anyway cable management won't
make much difference to cooling here
though everything is packed so tight I
want it absolutely perfect so the fact
that my case does not include any fans
whatsoever won't hurt my components over
the longer term why doesn't my case have
any cooling fans that's a great question
because there's no room this is the Dan
cases a for SFX at a mere seven point
two five liters it is the smallest case
on the market that can accept a full
sized enthusiast gaming graphics card
like the GT X 1080 that I'm planning to
use thanks to its unique layout that
uses a flexible PCI Express riser to put
the graphics card with a protective
plastic sheet right behind the
motherboard giving both of them
full access to fresh air through the
perforated side panels for my boot drive
I'll be using a samsung PM 863 3.8 4
terabyte SSD we are giving up some speed
compared to a 950 Pro or other nvme SSD
but were also almost quadruple in the
capacity of the largest readily
available SSDs at around the time of our
first compact build now there were some
cable management challenges but I was
able to hide the USB 3 connection and
power switch connection behind the
motherboard and thanks to one of
Silverstone's awesome CP 11 low-profile
SATA cables I was able to hide that to
our power supply is yet another piece of
amazeballs technology last time around
we used a full ATX 860 watt unit now in
the tiny SF XL form factor silverstone
was able to squeeze 700 watts with
80-plus platinum efficiency and a slim
120 millimeter fan that only spins when
system load reaches a certain threshold
the included cables are a bit bulky and
long but using cable mods configurator I
picked up colors I liked and had each
cable done to the exact length that I
needed to reduce bulk and give the
system a really clean appearance even
with the panels off a last-minute
inclusion was a cable mod wide beam RGB
LED strip I actually wasn't sure if I'd
managed to get that in there
since the lighting controller box is a
little bulky and even the leads that
come off of it take up a lot of space in
the context of a build like this but I
managed to squeeze it in proving once
and for all that RGB is the true herpes
of modern enthusiast PC building you
just can't get rid of it leading us
finally then to the gtx 1080 that will
be powering our gaming experience as the
king of the hill GPU at the moment it
really needs no introduction though I
will say that if you're planning a
similar build I would strongly suggest
that you opt for a rear blower design
like a Founders edition card due to the
a4 sfx's complete lack of case fans
the audio configuration of this machine
will rely on the DisplayPort or HDMI
output of our graphics card so make sure
that your monitor is equipped for that
then I plan to use a monitor with a
built-in hub or the front USB port with
a headset like the HyperX cloud 2 so
that's it
everything is crammed inside with barely
a cubic inch to spare so let's go ahead
and throw it on the bench and see how
this puppy performs and there you have
it she's rock solid stable I'm impressed
at how cool the $26.99 v4 runs on that
tiny little heatsink and I am really
impressed at how much PC hardware has
progressed in the last year and how much
of it Dan cases allowed us to cram into
this tiny little box compared to last
time in summary we've got four more CPU
cores double the RAM at double the
bandwidth eight times the storage
capacity a much faster graphics card and
to put it in the appropriate context the
razor core external GPU box which
contains only a graphics card a power
supply and some IO is about the same
size Wow crunchyroll is a site created
