2,816 stream processor clocked at one
point oh eight gigahertz boost clock
four gigs of DDR five memory on a 512
bit bus and all that's clocked at five
gigahertz as well but spoiler alert
that's not actually the interesting
thing about this product the r9 290x
lightning from MSI is the fastest
hands-down r9 290x card we have ever
tested and really it make it feels like
unlocks the potential of AMD's latest
and greatest GPU in a way that we
haven't seen yet with its factory tuning
and data center DNA and Intel 730 series
SSD is an amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts now it's not as
simple as I mean I know that sounds
great but it's not as simple as just
okay well everyone should just get our 9
290x Lightning cards because it's a
hundred and fifty bucks more than a bass
r9 290x and even $100 more than MSI's
pretty strong gaming card that has you
know a dual fan cooler and some of that
aftermarket stuff that we like to see so
like what do you actually get for your
extra hundred dollars well for one thing
MSI has moved beyond the dual fan Twin
Frozr cooler design to what they're
calling the Tri frozer and while I'm not
necessarily convinced that three fans
offers a tangible benefit over two
larger ones what's cool about this
design is that each of the fans is PWM
and can be individually controlled in
software so you could actually run how
whichever ones you want however fast you
want so you could be like okay well I
want the 86 millimeter ones on the
outside to run faster in the 70
millimeter what I'm going to ramp that
one down because when you have smaller
fans and you turn the RPMs up they can
tend to get a little bit whiny and loud
so you can actually control that however
you want to now okay
so before we get into some of the other
special stuff it does support the usual
AMD technology so crossfire up to 4-way
although you'll need to
water cool it if you want to do that ek
does have a block coming for this card
specifically because it is a triple slot
design out-of-the-box you've got support
for AMD mantle trueaudio a power tune
which is their dynamic clock speed
ramping up and ramping down to sort of
keep the card safe and within the right
temperatures and power you've got easy
eyefinity with no display port monitor
required so you could run three monitors
off of two DVI ports and an HDMI port
which is really cool or even up to six
displays if you use a DisplayPort hub
and then of course it's got a four gig
frame buffer like all r9 290 X's for a
better 4k gaming experience it also has
some unusual stuff so in the extremely
sexy folding box that actually has like
a drawer at the bottom for the
accessories along with the usual like
you know stickers and driver disk and
manual and all that stuff is a
certificate of stability adapters for
using a multimeter to check voltages and
a replacement VRM heatsink for subzero
cooling now the card itself is designed
with Sub Zero and nine it uses a
completely non reference PCB with a 12
plus three-phase power design for the
GPU and the RAM and three PCIe
connectors to eight pins and one six pin
something that that power-hungry GPU
pour in there may actually need when
you're really ramping up the clock speed
it's got an Ellen 2 BIOS switch which is
something that manufacturers tell us
isn't necessary if you're not going
sub-zero but this is two cards in a row
now that we've run into weird throttling
issues on the first one was the kingpin
classified 780ti from EVGA that was
immediately fixed by enabling Ellen to
mode and then once Ellen to mode was on
remember you turn it off flip the switch
because you're loading a new BIOS and
then reboot it the card was a dream to
overclock and we didn't run into any
issues at all so also on the top of the
card we have an LED indicator to show
the cards load so in theory the
Lightning logo is green for no load blue
for medium and red for a heavy load but
in practice once we overclocked it it
just kind of
red because we were pushing it pretty
pretty hard and then it also has a
series of blue LEDs on the back that
show you how many of the power phases
are active at any given time I did
mention that that cooler takes up three
slots but I can see why they did it
unlike some three slot coolers I've seen
before almost the entire top of the card
is basically a solid like grid of
aluminum lines and heat pipes running
through it and all of that so in terms
of the sheer mass the card is extremely
heavy so it's not like they just made it
thick in order to like kind of put fancy
things on it it's three slot because it
actually does perform that well and I
would love to see what a system would
look like if you did pull the coolers
off and put water blocks on them with
four of them running especially because
you don't need the interconnects anymore
so it would look extremely clean no
crossfire bridges it's all done over the
PCI Express bus and would perform
incredibly well now before I hand off to
Luke for benchmarking and telling you
guys you know what I've been teasing
just exactly how fast this card is I'd
like to give MSI some props here even
though they are asking for a significant
premium for the privilege they're giving
their customers the option to push the
card as hard as they want with that ln2
bios even at the risk of bricking it and
while officially they could reject your
warranty for stuff that you do to it in
my experience as long as there's nothing
physically altered on the card when they
receive it back they're not going to do
that so if you grab a 290x lightning you
can pretty much go to town on it because
this is a very nicely Bend GPU in here
with an extremely robust and actually
quite quiet under load cooler an awesome
backplate it looks great and okay okay
I'll stop stalling and I'll hand it off
to Luke to let you guys know just how
ballin this card is all right guys we're
going to start off with the bench we've
a CPU which is a 39 60 X clocked at 4.0
gigahertz for our RAM we have our RAM
running at 1866 megahertz and for the
graphics card it varies so check out the
overclocking dock in the description
below and be able to correlate the
overclocking settings for those cards
along with the graph that we will show
in a moment it did well it did pretty
much exactly how I expected
and that's not too surprising it's a
really well binge 290x I've been waiting
to get a really well binge 290x so that
could beat my 780 for a while now and
this one did it handily it doesn't meet
the 780ti which is again expected but
it's still very nice if you're looking
for overclocking tips if you get this
card I would highly recommend switching
into ln2 mode even if you're just air
cooling this seemed to add actually
quite a bit of stability to the Cardinal
is able to get core clock speeds much
higher once I switched into that mode

be sure to also click like share
favorite all that kind of stuff and
comment on whether or not this is a card
you're interested in I know some of the
American viewers might be a little bit
shaky about getting it just to the
cost-prohibitive mister is on buying a
290x in the States right now due to coin
money and all that kind of stuff if you
want to talk about that more maybe jump
over the forum it's a little bit
friendlier of a comment section and if
