attendees is over and with it comes the
end of the intel extreme rig challenge
all of the contestants have completed
their seventh generation Core i7
processor and 600 PSS be powered
computers if you haven't seen these
lead-up videos for this project you can
start with episode 1 right up here but
now we have the final awards and spoils
the seven teams that made it out of 12
include a be a direct origin pc
iBUYPOWER main gear cyber power pc side
acts and NCIX and they were competing in
four different categories most creative
best engineers highest performance and
most appeasing to you also known as
community choice the first category to
be decided was most creative and the top
three system builders in this category
where's I Dax NCIX PC and cyber power
cyber power went for a really unique
look and they accomplished this by
utilizing copper piping and using a D
frame chassis from in wid which is
really rare and helped make a pipe frame
style aesthetic they also use copper and
orange as their main colors which are
not very common and really helped them
stand out die - what with this really
cool-looking monochrome water cooling
setup with 1 loops being set up with
black liquid and another loop being set
up with white liquid and then contrasted
that monochrome with possibly the most
RGB enabled fans I have ever seen in a
single case and three individual
lighting controllers that were
accessible from outside of the case to
control all of those freaking fans NCIX
inspired by a Seuss's Gladius and spatha
mice with an impeccably detailed
engraving throughout their entire system
and fully utilize thermal takes RGB
water cooling fittings with white pastel
liquid cooling to great effect and it
really made their system pop when the
dust was settled and all the votes were
finally cast the grand winner of the
most creative category with cyber
PowerPC with Zayed acts and NCIX tying
for second next up was best engineered
and the top three systems
by the judges where NCIX side acts and
ABA direct now we just took a look at
side acts and ncx we're going to go
directly to a VA direct and clean and
pristine must have been the marching
orders at a VA when they were designing
this system from the color palette to
the aluminium cable combs chosen just to
perfectly manage all of their cables to
the water cooling setup in general it
comes together in a computer that is
just refreshing to look at but in the
end when all was said and done NCIX took
first place with a be a direct coming in
right behind them and Zayed acts pulling
a solid third then we come to a category
with no judges no community judges no
judge panel this is performance you have
to win with a score in this one and the
top three systems were AV a direct side
acts for a third freaking time and I buy
power high power system was the
legendary snowblind which we've actually
featured on our channel twice in the
past
it features an awesome side panel which
is a translucent monitor which you can
do with pretty much whatever you want
you can do anything that you were doing
on normal monitor over there but it's
recommended that you run a rainmeter
setup which will show all your system
settings which is actually pretty badass
inside that side panel you see an
extremely white overall aesthetic with
very intense LEDs because they have to
generate a lot of light and bounce a lot
of light around in order to have it come
through that translucent side panel but
when the numbers came in for performance
a be a direct claimed a strong first
place with dyed acts and iBUYPOWER
claiming second and third respectively
which leaves us with me grand prize the
Community Choice Awards
there was one hundred and twenty six
thousand four hundred and forty four
votes Kathleen to the twelve original
teams that were entered in this contest
but above all others with origin PC and
I get it their computer or computers
should I say at this point our epic to
explain what I mean by that they're
running to in
visual VR ready systems within the same
electric-blue chassis each system is
revealed through its own translucent
monitor on its own side panel talk about
using the budget I think origin really
went with the two computers for the
price of awesome on this one if you want
to play VR games with a friend or spouse
at home look no further this computer
perfectly fits that albeit relatively
small niche and with that the Intel
Extreme Rage challenge of 2017 is
concluded thank you to all of the system
builders for participating win or lose
you guys
all had spectacular systems thanks to
Intel for doing this again and letting
me be a part of it and last but not
least at all thanks to you guys for
watching and commenting and voting let
me know in the comments down below if
you'd be interested in seeing Intel do
this again next year and with that I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
