brought to you by Squarespace build it
beautiful and on a subject of building
it beautiful we're here in the Swift
Tech Suites
and they have actually a surprising
number of things on display their
launching not one but two actually no
not two but three no not three but
actually two times that it's like three
times two of one type of product anyway
they've got six different all in one
liquid coolers everything from a dual
120 to a dual 140 to a triple 120
millimeter radiator design with a couple
of different variants but first let's
walk through all the changes that
they've made from the H x-series so this
is the H whatever number corresponds to
the side X - very creatively named
congratulations you guys so first of all
they have made some changes to the
mounting system for the CPU block
instead of me being subjected to that
whole finicky hold the back plate on or
maybe get sticky residue all over your
back plate while you try and screw it in
from the front thing they've gone with a
male-to-female adapter so that it right
out of the box you can screw it into an
LGA 2011 socket or with the adapter you
can screw it into the m3 threaded so the
actually thinner threaded more
traditional backplate with one little
adapter and then you screw the block
right into that I've seen other guys use
this system in the past and it is
legitimately better the next thing
you'll probably notice about it
immediately is whoa that block looks
really really cool in addition to having
LED lighting effects and more on the LED
lighting effects later actually they've
also added an acrylic top that I think
looks absolutely sublime especially when
you see it installed in a system with
the LEDs turned on to go with that
they've changed over from their
traditional sort of black kind of
frankly sorry boring tubing to a clear
tubing design that is going to
complement very well this little
addition now this is cool
the first thing I said when Swift tech
told me hey we're going to include dyes
in the box was are they any good and the
answer was there mayim i'll so you've
got to be kidding me a you're using the
best
eyes on the market best regarded eyes on
the market bar none and be you're
actually just saying it yeah we
partnered up with those guys we're
including their dyes you mix and match
any color you want and boom you're clear
tubes look like that which leads us to
and I know this is a lot of different
changes actually considering that all
they called it was the X - and not the X
completely something different because
there are more changes on the radiator
they've upgraded the paint finish it is
much more durable actually feels nicer
to the touch they have completely
altered the reservoir and I think it
looks great so they've got an LED strip
that actually illuminates the water
whether it's clear or whether it's
colored it is just a I don't know what
to say about it it's clearer it's larger
and they've managed to do all of this
without making it any higher profile and
any more likely to interfere with
anything because if you look at it from
the side actually compared to even most
custom blush and say most even custom
water cooling radiators the tanks at the
end are very very short the pump hasn't
really been altered it's still an MCP
350 so that's your your quieter version
of the DDC it is still PWM controlled
but on the subject of PWM control I also
want to introduce you guys to this
little number so I've used their PWM
controller probably most famously in our
whole room water cooling setup where we
ran a bunch of radiators on the roof of
a house but they have made some changes
this time so now you've got the one that
controls the others you've got only
three four pin fan headers but they've
added some other interesting things so
these little headers right here are for
addressable LEDs which means that each
individual LED is controllable and
mixable and with the right software
something they're actually working on
you can actually create effects with
them but if you're not even into effects
anyway and you just want basic control
this puppy will do that for you -
there's a little button on board so what
you got to do is you take out your case
side panel you open it up you reach in
you find your little fan controller
doodad that you tucked away somewhere
because it's a bunch of wires you press
the button actually you don't have to do
that so they've actually put a little
two pin connector so that you can change
your reset switch something very few
people use and some case manufacturers
don't even include or any other button
you can wire it up yourself and you can
cycle through different colors
so this technology is going to get even
better over time because it allows us to
mix not only colors but also different
brightnesses for a wide variety of
different effects now I talked about the
radio talked about the reservoir talked
about the pump what I've ignored is the
fans those aren't Hilux fans let's art
Swift tech fans at all in fact those are
those are those are those are those are
noise block your fans those are their
ellipse fans well hold on a second
once again acknowledging that you know
unfortunately designing widely regarded
as the best if not one of the best fans
on the market is not freaking easy Swift
Tech has decided to just straight-up
partner with noise blocker on these in
order to provide the absolute finest of
performance for their customers that is
assuming that they're willing to pay
so these SKUs are available in a couple
of different configurations each that's
why there are actually six different
models the dual 120 millimeter version
of the base model is one 39.99 the dual
140 comes in at 149 99 if I recall
correctly and the triple 120 is 165 if
you want the version with the noise
blocker fans you're going to pay an
additional $50 per skill but the good
news is that you also get Swift text
compression fittings instead of their
barbed and collared fittings that
although very reliable aren't as
attractive looking especially if you're
looking to expand your system in the
future and expand you can just like the
last generation it is no problem to add
a video card add two video cards out
another radiator it's an MCP 350 it is
legitimately custom aftermarket grade
and honestly with all the improvements
that they've made to it this time around
everything from improved case
compatibility to improve CPU mounting to
improved aesthetic in my opinion this is
looking like a pretty attractive product
considering that for the base model they
haven't altered the price over the last
generation and we've got another little
treat over here this is the Apple G SKF
the upcoming flagship standalone
enthusiast block from Swift tech they
won't tell me everything about it
necessarily like I don't know anything
about the intern
floo optimizations that they're saying
are particularly badass but what they
did tell me because the first thing I
said when I saw it was holy crap those
things are really close together and
it's kind of smug smile yeah their point
one five millimeter in thickness so
about a piece of paper with that much
distance between them like it's freakin
unbelievable so I was like come on you
gotta you gotta be kidding me here how
did you do that well the answer is not
by taking a hunk of copper and then
running a bit through it to create
channels the answer is through a
technique called skiving that's where
the SKF asked I've in my naming schemes
man right that's where that comes from
so what's actually done is like a blade
is used to to slice to like to shave the
copper and then bend it up into a fin
over and over and over again so the fins
are actually like kind of curvy if you
were to look at them from the side but
that is how they are able to achieve
such tiny little fins and of course you
know the looks being able to stare at it
and admire through the window of the
block how tight they are together is
cool but if it didn't contribute
anything to performance then I'm sure
they wouldn't bother doing it but Swift
exclaiming compared to their previous
flagship up to a 6 degree improvement
something I would have thought was
impossible at this point so thanks for
checking out not only this but all of
our Linus tech safe coverage of CES 2016
