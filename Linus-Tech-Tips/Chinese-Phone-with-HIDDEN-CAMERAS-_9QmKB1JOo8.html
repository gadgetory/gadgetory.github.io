here not because it's not cool it's just
that the cool thing we're focused on
today is a lot smaller these are coming
hard and heavy now I'm talking of course
about the bezel list notch list phones
from you know major brands like Oppo
beep oh okay yeah they're both a lot
bigger in Asia especially Appa Appa is
freaking huge in Asia so but how is it
that they beat Samsung to the punch and
for that matter what was Apple thinking
trying to make taking a bite out of your
display into some kind of a status
symbol
their hubris is gonna be their downfall
I swear actually you know what Who am I
kidding if it hasn't happened yet then
why would it start now anyway this is
the find X from Chinese brand Oppo and
the reviewers guide came with a bunch of
restrictions in terms of what I was or
wasn't allowed to test but I didn't sign
anything so let's fire up the trickiest
phone camera I had ever seen and look at
some test photos and stuff shall we
the hope right
speaking of ah do you not have a VPN go
check out private Internet access we've
got a link below get a VPN today
so I'm gonna go ahead and say it it is
one thing to rip off the iPhone 10 and
it is another to rip off the galaxy s 9
plus but to rip off both of them and
somehow do it at the same time that is
impressive
and that takes some serious hutzpah so
the fine 10 and it stopped me if you
heard this one before is a flagship
Android smartphone if it's not dragon
845 processor eight gigs of lpddr4 ram
up to 256 gigs of storage a 3730 million
power battery that is strangely specific
dual SIM slots fast 5 volt 4 and a half
am charging Android 8.1 and yes here is
the first big iPhone 10 rip off
somebody's done it
somebody has cloned face ID so my
initial briefing materials this is great
said they were planning to call this Oh
face structured light Joe it swipe Oh
anyway I guess some party pooper tipped
them off so the official name is
probably TBD but it uses a flood
illuminator an infrared camera a
proximity sensor a dot projector
receiver and an RGB camera which is
another way of saying a camera and so
far the thing has worked basically
seamlessly like check this out so what
you do is you swipe it grabs your face
it takes about half a second to go up
and then half a second to go down and
bam you're unlocked now unfortunately I
can't demo side-by-side with the iPhone
10 because for whatever reason face ID
is broken on my iPhone I didn't feel
like waiting two hours at the Apple
store last time I was in the mall but
from my memory the speed is actually
pretty similar once you factor in that
the iPhone 10 uses a lift to wake
mechanism before face ID will grab your
face and register it so by comparison
this one I mean okay so it does have
lift awake so I'm just gonna show though
it has lift awake but the facial scanner
obviously is is recessed right now
so what you have to do is you have to
swipe the screen and then it comes up
and then it goes back down once it's
done it's pretty freakin cool so it uses
a total of fifteen thousand dots and if
nothing else this is an absolutely
jaw-dropping part jaw-dropping
jaw-dropping party trick like check this
up so I'm gonna I'm gonna go to my way
to lock it and like you know you pull
out your phone to be like no with that
said I do wish and this is true of both
the find X and the iPhone 10 that like
vivos next s there was a fingerprint
scanner under the screen this is a great
solution because there are no moving
parts and this one actually has a fairly
similar screen to body ratio to the find
X I can say too though I mean not
drawing a ton of conclusions right now
cuz my time with the device has been
pretty limited but I think I prefer
apples lift to activate rather than
swipe to activate especially because it
allows face ID to work well it's just
sitting down on a table in front of you
but then you are stuck with the notch
that holds all of the face ID sensors
and you don't get the all screen
experience and the all screen experience
is pretty freakin cool
like I didn't rip out the calipers but
Apple claims that this is a 90 2.25%
screen to body ratio and I have no
reason whatsoever to doubt it it looks
absolutely amazing they're using pretty
much every trick available today
including something called Co P or chip
on panel which is like a flexible screen
technology which basically kind of wraps
the electronics for the display under
the visible part of the panel which
curves around the sides so it doesn't
have to sit on the edges which gives you
less bezel than ever before and that is
where the Samsung Galaxy S 9 comes in
okay come over here so so the
similarities here are
pretty striking so they've both got
curved gorilla glass five on both the
front and the back this one's got a deep
brown skin so you can't really see it
there but it's there this one's got a
six point four inch AMOLED display
running 2340 by 1080 so is slightly
lower resolution but I do actually
prefer this taller aspect ratio so
that's a nineteen and a half by nine
aspect ratio other than the difference
in the bezels here on the bottom and
here on the top so the fine ten is using
a swipe based navigation by the way you
can use gestures or you can add buttons
these things look so similar like
there's very little to distinguish them
on the top the s9 plus has got the sim
tray whereas this one doesn't but that's
obviously because they've got this
motorized mechanism for the camera here
you couldn't very well put a sim slot in
that thing and then on the bottom yeah
okay so they weren't able to fit a
headphone jack presumably because they
needed to make room for the dual SIM
tray right there huh it is a little bit
thinner though which doesn't really
register in the hand so much because it
feels a little heavier although I
haven't actually put either of them on
the scale the other the other thing that
similar is even the color so I've got
the board L version of the fine ten and
I've got the lilac version of the s9 so
they've actually both managed to come
out with purple phones which previously
I don't think was a very common thing
yeah so not super stoked on the lack of
headphone jack oh right other other
differences lock buttons on this side
and then over here the only thing
missing is a big speed button if you're
especially into that sort of thing which
I suspect most of you are not camera
wise we've got 20 megapixel dual cameras
whatever that means
so the spec sheet that I had actually
wasn't a hundred percent sure it seemed
to think it was a 16 megapixel F 2.0 and
a 20 megapixel F 2.2 and because it's
got dual cameras it does have a portrait
mode but quite frankly maybe they still
have some software work to do or
something along those lines I did do
some test shots but it is
pretty rough right now which is kind of
weird to me especially when you consider
that Oppo is closely related to one plus
and one plus is portrait mode actually
isn't too shabby this is actually not a
terrible example of it it did reasonably
well here but the biggest difference so
the main phones that I used for
comparison were the s9 plus the pixel to
excel and then I threw in both the Nexus
and the fine ten and the biggest
difference between the Korean and the
American phone I guess and the Chinese
ones were that instead of a bokeh effect
the Chinese phones both seemed to be
content with blurring the background
which is not necessarily the same thing
they don't look the same another big
difference that I noticed between this
and the s 9 plus is actually something
that I first picked up on a review that
I'm working on of the Alcatel 3v so this
is a hundred and fifty dollar phone way
at the other end of the spectrum here
and that is that for some reason and I
still haven't narrowed down exactly why
because Netflix did not reply to my
inquiry but for some reason the HDR
certified phones that I'm getting are
not just getting an HDR version of
movies like this is thor ragnarok here
they are also getting a higher
resolution version it is very noticeable
in the hair on the characters or in any
fine details in the distance that this
one not only has HDR colors it is also
getting a higher resolution feed and I
haven't quite figured out exactly why
that would be so jury's kind of out on
this other than lacking HDR wireless
charging and having some serious
misgivings about the durability of this
mechanism like I'm already noticing when
I'm holding the camera to take a picture
I'm kind of getting my fingers in there
and if I were to close the camera while
they're in there
it doesn't pinch but there's there's
definitely room for it to screw up I'm
not sure if I'm ready to give a
recommendation but I don't know if that
matters because there isn't even like a
Lobel rom available yet with Android
assistant for example things that North
Americans would be used to seeing and I
don't know if Apple has any plans to
enter North America but it's definitely
a cool phone I'm just not sure if this
as amazing and cool as it is is quite
the right approach to all screen but I
just I don't not a hundred percent sure
what the answer is so so far we've got
the knotch
which I also don't think is the right
answer
we've got your selfie camera down here
and just one big bezel which I'm not
sure is the right answer
we've got Samsung with you know maybe
they can make this a little smaller but
beyond that they really can't go
anywhere with it and then we've got vivo
with the in screen fingerprint sensor
which is not a bad approach but remember
they too have a mechanical camera
raising thing but with this one it only
pops up when you need to take a selfie
which for me anyway comes up an awful
lot less so let me know your comments
below
does Oppo have the right approach here
or do we have to rethink everything
doesn't even matter if you have an all
screen phone I will say it makes
everything else feel very last gen like
a pixel 2 XL is like like caveman Tech
compared to this thing and I remember
being impressed by this one this video
is brought to you by mass drop the mass
drop x - an 8350 headphone specifically
they're using new dynamic drivers so
different from what was used in the 8300
which results in a more neutral sound
signature they feature our comfortable
headband velour earpads and a detachable
cable and they ship within two to three
days so check them out at the link in
the video description and also while
you're on mass drop check out all the
freaking awesome deals that they've got
over there so thanks for watching guys
if you dislike this video you can hit
that button but if you liked it hit like
get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured how how you can't so I don't
know buy something else at the link in
the video description also down there is
our merch store which has cool shirts
like this one and our community forum
which you should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
