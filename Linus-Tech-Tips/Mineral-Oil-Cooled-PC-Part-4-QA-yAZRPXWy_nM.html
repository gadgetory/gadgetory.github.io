finally finished mineral oil submersion
cooled PC with some inside the oil shots
courtesy of the Sony action cam how did
we get a waterproof camera inside our PC
that I can't really tell you but what I
can tell you is a bit about the camera
itself it supports recording it up to
1080p 60fps 720p 120 FPS with Sony's
steady shot image stabilization it
features a zeiss hundred and 70 degree
altra wide-angle lens and most
importantly for us the one we picked up
this morning comes with a waterproof
housing that appears to be oil proof at
least over the very very short term
obviously that's not really what it's
made for it's more for like crazy
extreme action shots like this one that
we borrowed from Sony's channel which
you can check out by clicking the
annotation right there but that isn't to
say that PC stuff is an extreme and this
my friends is about as extreme as it
gets here she is looking so shiny thanks
to the constantly cleaning properties of
the mineral oil and weighing in at a
massive 75 pounds mine and Luke's love
child Slick jr. the hardware specs for
our mineral oil cooled machine are as
follows making it one of the fastest
fully submerged gaming machines ever
built we've got a core i7 59 60 x8 core
processor overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz
and cooled by a thermal Wright Silver
Arrow we've got 16 gigs of HyperX beast
3,000 megahertz ddr4 memory and EVGA x99
micro motherboard at the time of
selecting our parts for this project the
only on ATX x99 motherboard on the
market an EVGA GTX 780 classified
graphics card an EVGA supernova 1200
watt 80 + platinum power supply of 480
gig hyper x 3k SSD and finally the case
a Puget systems micro ATX v2 aquarium
case kitted out with all the fun
accessories we could put in it like blue
rocks for the bottom a castle and our
awesome little plant oh yeah and a
sunken ship building this machine was an
absolute blast Luke and I did it take
they're over the course of several
afternoons and there were some hilarious
moments some tense moments have some
downright scary moments so if you guys
haven't checked out parts one two and
three of the build log you should do
that if you're interested in how this
beast was created but if you just want
to know how the whole mineral oil
cooling concept works and how this one
performs then you're in luck because
today's video is all about that at stock
speeds I was really impressed with the
four fans on the rear radiators running
at their lowest speed the temperature of
the coolant was only about eight degrees
above ambient at idle and seventeen
degrees above ambient with both the CPU
and GPU running at full tilt yielding
low temperatures under 60 degrees for
both of them overclocked things got a
little bit hairier my CPU is running at
4.5 gigahertz on eighth course with the
GPU running at one point 267 gigahertz
and in this scenario the oil heated up a
lot more thanks to the dramatically
higher heat output from both of these
components because the heatsink for the
CPU doesn't have a fan next to it to
circulate oil our chip reached 88
degrees 30 degrees higher than stock
speed under load but the GPU thanks to
its fans peaked at only 59 degrees much
much lower than air cooling and overall
much quieter with only low speed fans
and the pump whose noises dampened
significantly by the oil producing any
audible noise but I'm sure you guys
still have lots of questions so I'm
gonna go grab loop to help me answer
them we're gonna do a little QA thing
here all right so loops joining me for
the Q&amp;amp;A section of this video I mean you
guys watched us build the whole thing
but we had a lot of people posting
questions in the comments and we wanted
to address some of the most common ones
so first the way this system works in
spite of being under liquid is that
mineral oil is not a conductive fluid so
as long as the fluid isn't conductive
you're not going to run into the usual
issue where an electrical short will
cause the system to shut down or even be
damaged so people would then ask why not
distill their deionized water the
problem with that is that water will
pick up minerals a little
metals and stuff and then make
themselves conductive over time so you
might get like 5-10 minutes half an hour
tops out of it but then it'll short out
your system over time we chose this tank
instead of some random fish tank for a
couple of reasons number one is that
getting all the parts from one source is
actually a lot more convenient and B can
actually be cheaper because you're
saving on shipping cost of getting it
shipped to you from a dozen different
places and number two is that it's
specifically designed for mineral oil
submersion and the walls are thicker
which makes the plexi less prone to
cracking from the constant heating up
and cooling down now when you're
choosing parts to go into the oil
honestly it almost doesn't even really
matter you just have to be careful what
you put under it in terms of type of
component not necessarily like counter
graphics card go under or it can this
specific graphics card go under so you
can't put your optical drive under there
you can't put your hard drive under
there because they have mechanically
moving components and that's that will
actually spear that up your hard drive
might work for a little bit but then the
needles gonna get off it's gonna be
going really slowly for one and then it
will probably eventually stop working
the funnel question is a fun Li one
because the only reason we didn't use a
funnel is because in spite of the number
of times we've run into situations where
we could use one
we actually don't own one and DIY and
one didn't occur to us at the time we
didn't put the oil in first and then the
components because of like fairly
obviously dissipate displacement
problems if you put oil in and then put
all the stuff in you probably won't have
the exact amount of oil you'll have too
much or too little and that's not great
filling the system all the way to the
top might seem like a good idea on the
surface and it might help with this
trickling noise that we're getting right
now because we couldn't put that little
piece of tubing in thanks to a clearance
issue with the graphics card by the way
it doesn't trickle when the oil is
cooler and more viscous I'm running a
stress test right now but the reason
that you wouldn't fill it all the way to
the top is that mineral oil already
creeps up surfaces and the higher you
are the closer you are to the top the
more it's going to creep up and start
destroying your cables and anything
that's plugged into the system below the
problems with rubber in a system like
this especially that softer kind of
rubber the
you might find not on this bubble
machine but on some bubble machines feet
so you can stick it to the prop bottom
of the tank is that the mineral oil will
actually eat it away and slowly make it
decompose almost sending little tiny
gooey fragments of the rubber all
throughout your oil making it look
completely gross and actually disrupting
the system overall fish would be a
terrible terrible idea you should be
ashamed of yourself for even asking this
is not water
this is mineral oil fish would die
instantly in it they cannot breathe
mineral oil now I've seen proposals on
the internet for crazy ideas where you
actually have like a partition dividing
the fish keeping them separate from the
mineral oil but even then there are
challenges fish are extremely sensitive
to changes in water temperature just
like we're sensitive to changes in air
temperature I don't think anyone has
ever pulled that off I know why don't we
have a fan on the heat sink we don't
have a family heat sink because we
already have a lot of flow and a lot of
movement in the oil from other sources
and it's it actually wouldn't serve a
huge purpose it might not even help that
much because of the wear it would be
pushing the oil so there's no actual
point in having a fan there with the
video card it's a little bit different
it's not next to the pump it's actually
right up against the edge of the
aquarium so having the fans circulating
oil through the heatsink will cool the
heat sink in much the same way that
circulating air through a heat sink will
in fact quite a bit better
we have radiators on the system because
oil is going to be able to hold that
temperature really well but it's not
very good at getting rid of it so if you
had a high-performance system and no
radiators your temperatures just going
to keep on going up until it's at unsafe
levels if you have radiators on the back
it can pull that oil out cool it down
put it back in and it'll kind of more
regulate the actual temperature the pump
we're using is actually a standard PC
water cooling pump it's a Swift tech MCP
3:55 nothing special about it other than
that it's a nice reliable Lang made pump
is there actually any actual benefit of
this compared to air or water not really
other the fact that it looks really
freaking cool as long as you don't let
any gunk get into your oil like if you
had rubber
opponents inside that start to
deteriorate or if you had the cover not
closed and some things fell into it
there's no reason to clean out the oil
it doesn't need to be changed like your
car would now some people when they see
the fan spinning really slowly start to
freak out and think that all the fans
are gonna die because there's way too
much resistance from the oil actually
the mineral oil acts as a lubricant so
yeah it's a little bit harder for the
fan to spin but with the lubricant there
and a steady amount of voltage going to
the fan not a steady amount of speed
being attempted to be applied to the fan
it's actually totally fine graphics card
upgrade would not exactly be a fun
experience not that many upgrades in
here are going to be a fun experience
but that's part of the experience of
owning a mineral oil computer it's
everything you do with it is really
interesting I built mine because I
wanted a really interesting computer and
I knew what was gonna come with that so
if you had to swap the graphics card
you'd probably be the layering an area
with garbage bags so that you didn't
have mineral oil going all over the
place taking everything out putting part
of the system inside of a garbage bag
for a little while taking that card out
putting a new one in submerging all that
back in probably getting more oil
because you lost some on to the garbage
bags filling it up and running the
system again and then you're gonna have
to deal with that other oil colored oil
covered graphics card most parts of any
pc component are not going to be damaged
by mineral oil things like metals things
like the components of printed circuit
boards if anything having mineral oil
over top of them especially with some
nice flow through it is gonna keep the
running cooler and even make them more
reliable over time the only time you're
gonna run into trouble is anything like
cables for example which can be damaged
by mineral oil and in fact made so stiff
that you could break the sheathing
around the outsides of say for example
power supply cables once they've been
sitting in mineral oil for quite some
time now with thermal compound the
mineral oil can kind of get down in
there and eat away at the outsides of it
and it might take a lot of it away over
five years of running my own I didn't
see all of the thermal compound room
removed but especially on my graphics
card when I tried to run it outside of
the of the mineral computer after drying
it there was enough thermal
removed that I ended up frying my card
so yes it does take the thermal compound
away but it should be fine while you're
inside the mineral oil because the
components haven't been damaged by the
oil there's no reason that you can't
reuse them the only issue is that you're
probably gonna have to let them drip dry
in a nice warm place for a good few
weeks before you're even gonna want to
consider touching them and even once
they've dripped dry for a few weeks
they're always gonna have a little bit
of that oily feel to them it won't hurt
the functionality though so if you get
it on your clothes you're just gonna
need a lot of hot water and a lot of
soap it's not easy to get out but it's
not really a problem I don't actually
know what happens if you happened to
leave your shirt with mineral oil on it
for a very extended period of time
because I've always cleaned it fairly
quickly but I've never actually had any
downsides if you don't your skin it's no
real problem it's just a fairly simple
oil worth the mess Wow it's amazing how
many of you quoted what I said when we
first showcased lube sold mineral oil
machine and I said something along the
lines of no never ever absolutely never
we are never gonna do this on our
channel and having done it once I still
don't think that it's worth the effort
to the point where I really wanted to
create a guide that you guys definitely
need to follow because it's not
something that I think people should
really do unless they're hyper enthused
about it and they're willing to go out
and do the research on their own to do
it
because if you're not willing to put
that amount of work into it you're
probably not a suitable mineral oil
cooled machine owner although I'll let
Luke answer this question in his own
words as well no that was actually a
really good explanation it's it's going
to take some work it is going to be
tedious you're gonna have to haul this
super heavy thing around sometimes it is
going to take some dedication you're not
gonna be able to do these really rapid
upgrades that you might want to do if
replacing a single Ram stick is gonna be
a hell of a problem diagnosing things
becomes a little bit different instead
of what I commonly do is just swapping
out parts until I figure out what's dead
you're gonna have to spend a lot more
time doing software based diagnosis just
it becomes a mess but honestly it's a
really cool experience you just have to
make
sure that you're like dedicated nothing
you actually really want this because it
it's tedious so this is where I have
some good news and some bad news
halfway through completing our build
blog series on Puget
micro-atx revved to mineral oil
submerging cooling kit we heard from
Puget that due to a patent dispute from
a company that is just hardcore trolling
it like if you guys are upset about this
show some support to Puget because this
is a really crappy thing that's going on
these guys tried to do mineral oil
cooled gaming machines a while back
their business venture ultimately didn't
succeed and now they're just patent
trolling Puget to the point where this
isn't a huge part of hugest business
they just do it because they're
enthusiasts about it so they're kind of
going well shoot we can't we can't
justify the costs and time associated
with defending ourselves from this BS so
we're gonna have to discontinue these
systems unfortunately you can't buy them
anymore although the cost was about a
thousand dollars for a kit and all the
mineral oil you needed to fill it a
little less than eight hundred to a
thousand dollars so yeah guys show some
show some support because it's a super
crappy thing that's going on but in
response to the right so the good news
though is that we're actually getting
the rest of puget inventory now don't
freak out it's only about four units of
the mini ITX and micro ATX we're getting
the rest of their inventory to give away
to anyone in the continental US and
canada who wants to own their very own
mineral oil submersion cooling but one
of the last ones that puget ever produce
they can't sell them anymore
so they're giving them to us to give to
you guys you guys are gonna want to go
to the link in the video description to
get the full details but I will say this
much guys we're gonna require the
winners to send us a copy of their
invoice for purchasing the mineral oil
to put into it we're not looking to just
ship these two guys who aren't going to
use them we want people to really get
use out of them this is a really cool
project but if you're not that into it
just don't enter the giveaway because we
want people who are really excited about
building a mineral oil cooled machine to
to get their hands on these so I think
that's pretty much it guys thanks for
watching like this video if you liked it
just like it if you just liked it
a comment if your feelings are more
complicated than this as always there's
links in the video description to our
sponsors as well as the other thing that
we do what else do we do absolutely
right the amazon link t-shirts and new
office campaign why isn't it working and
also our other channel where we what
have you done it didn't I swear to god
I'm not even pressing yours just because
it's not working yet this is gonna suck
we're also gonna have a link to our
channel super fun where you can find out
why Luke and I are wearing shot colors
that were you're putting the vibrate one
and also it's not working well whatever
there's gonna be a video where we're
rolling each other with shock collars
once we get them
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
