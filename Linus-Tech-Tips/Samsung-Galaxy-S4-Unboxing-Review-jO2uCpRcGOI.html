to learn more welcome to my video of the
samsung galaxy s4 which is sort of an
unboxing and more sort of an overview
after me spending we can change with the
device and sort of what i thought of it
so it's gonna be featuring my cat galaxy
which is naturally not his name at all
and he's not going to be in the video so
i'd like to start with my plain white
box which is a press box you don't get
your galaxy s4 in a box like this and it
won't have your name on it mine says
Linus Sebastian on it which happens to
be my name
very very cool okay so slicks operating
the camera today so feel free to direct
all of your complaints about the camera
work today too slick on the forum okay
there's a micro sim starter kit I got at
Ellis phone so it also gave me a bit of
a chance to check out tell us his
network because normally I'm a bell
customer so it was not that interesting
it was fine I didn't really have any
complaints we've got a Samsung charger
as well as a Samsung dongle it should be
noted that you'll get the best charging
performance using a genuine Samsung
charger so that's something to note and
then I got actually I added this piece
of foam myself the phone was actually
not in a piece of foam it was just in
the box with all the other parts loose
but they never intended to ship it that
way so it's so it's all good so let's
start with TouchWiz --is optimizations
most Android users probably won't care
too much about particularly things like
up here where you can see either this is
great so this is more like what TouchWiz
users are going to be used to go back
this is more like what TouchWiz users
are going to be used to seeing right
here with all of your toggles but now
there's a whole thing where you can get
like 20 of them and they're all up there
you can turn on and off everything from
Wi-Fi GPS and sound things that you
would actually use day-to-day to things
like they're smart scrolling smart stay
driving mode all those kinds of things
that you normally you wouldn't touch too
much but of course you have the option
of seeing the whole list or not seeing
the whole list
now there's third-party apps to do
pretty much everything but not
everyone's going to be capable of using
them my mum for example just went to
Android
and I mean even something like
installing an app is way beyond her so
honestly if I'd had the choice I'd have
been happier to give her something like
an s4 if possible because easy mode
would have made my life a little bit
easier when it comes to helping her set
it up so basically okay yeah yeah yeah
will be applied to your home screens all
of this stuff so it turns everything
into nice big old people friendly
buttons that they don't have to think
about too much and you can pretty much
set up for them once and then not have
to touch it anymore I mean there's no
way my mom calls more than like nine
people so I could set all those people
up there for her and also you have to do
is swipe to the left to make a call and
swipe to the right to put on the basic
apps that I actually thinks that she
needs to use now the proximity sensor is
really cool now Samsung's integrated a
lot of technology with the s4 that goes
from profoundly useful to profoundly
useless I think some of the highlights
for me were s Translate which I didn't
use day-to-day obviously but if I was
traveling it actually works pretty well
the only languages that I can speak and
understand are really English in French
and at least that mode worked
outstandingly well the one drawback is
that it does use data so if you're
traveling unless you have a data plan
there you might find yourself not using
it that much the proximity sensor I also
found was really cool the motion sensor
so you can do things like call someone
once you've got them open in your
contacts just by here we go so I'm gonna
call I'm gonna call myself once you have
that person up you can just place the
call by putting the phone to your ear it
actually works but it's not exactly a
new feature by any stretch of the
imagination and with things like swipe
to the right to call swipe to the left
for text it's not exactly groundbreaking
in terms of how much more quickly it's
gonna allow you to use your phone which
I found was sort of my experience with a
lot of the Samsung features that they've
added so one one one thing was waving to
answer a call if it was just kind of
like this or you just like pass over at
once then I could really see the
usefulness of it but the first time I
tried to use it I realized you actually
have to wave over several times you have
to move quite slowly so for me I'd be
faster just pick it up and go like this
and answer my call I mean the the one
implementation
oh yeah and same thing with what sort of
browsing web page
and stuff like that so when you have the
internet browser open I have like a
Wikipedia page open here so you can yeah
you can browse web pages like that but I
ever since the advent of momentum based
scrolling in browsers I don't really see
a point in having something like that
the one area where I found this really
useful is normally when you're moving
applications around on your device you
would pick it up and then you'd kind of
drag it somewhere whereas with this you
can pick it up so you just press and
hold and then you can kind of go like
this to decide which page you want to
put it on but you can see it actually
sort of went backwards once when I
accidentally did that for the most part
it was pretty intuitive and I found that
was the most useful thing about the
motion sensor in front of the camera
slick brought up an interesting point to
me that if you have junk on your hands
and you don't want to touch your phone
then things like the fact that the
capacitive touchscreen can be operated
even if you're not quite touching it
which I personally found to be more of
an annoyance than anything else and I
did turn it off pretty much immediately
because just trying to scroll around on
a web page it was like zooming in on
things and telling me stuff about it and
it was like oh no that's not actually
what I wanted but if you're just trying
to answer your phone while your nails
dry personally I paint my nails all the
time then yeah I can see the usefulness
of that but it wasn't something that
comes up for me a lot so there you go
the screen is widely regarded to be much
better than previous pentile display
such as on the galaxy s3 so while the
matrix isn't necessarily one to one to
one of every pixel color it is close
enough that you don't have that same
blurriness in the text and I personally
didn't observe it at all and comparing
side-by-side with the HTC One I don't
notice that anything other than the fact
that the vibrance is like I blindingly
vibrant which is a lot of people like
that I didn't notice any problems with
it compared to LCD the lock screen has
been changed as well for example you can
do this
which is obviously useful but that's not
actually sort of the improvements so you
can swipe to the right to get to some
frequently used applications and whatnot
and you can swipe to the left to get
widgets for example which I personally
thought was really cool it should be
noted you like so many Android things
like I mentioned at the very beginning
of this video a lot of the improvements
Samsung's making can be done with
third-party apps but necessarily
everyone wants to do that so let's get
into the ergonomics and build quality
which is something that everyone's
talking about with this phone because
the most notable thing about it is that
it's not really that different from the
s3 I do find it more comfortable to hold
them the s3 particularly the more square
shape of the side it was is less it digs
into me a little bit less also the the
rounded corners compared to the HTC One
which has more sharp corners that I
found dug into my palm a bit more I did
find that more comfortable however the
overall rigidness of the chassis which
have seen argued both ways as a feature
and as a drawback so you can see I can
bend that phone does a couple of things
so number one is it makes it feel more
like more like an older phone when
especially if you come from iPhone which
I did I was an iPhone 4 user for a long
time where you come from something like
an HTC One which feels like just ah
feels really really good so the s4 has
that kind of going against it but I've
also heard people say well come on it's
the only phone right now with Gorilla
Glass 3 which adds ruggedness and adds
durability it's got a plastic chassis
which means it'll absorb shock more
easily when it's dropped so that's
another prevailing theory as well and it
enables Samsung to do their whole
doesn't that come on
at least it's harder to get off than the
old one there you go you have to like
really be dedicated to getting the back
panel off if you want to and you can
remove the back panel replace the
battery which I don't see most people
doing especially with those little
portable battery banks I mean I carry
ones like you carry one right yeah I
mean especially with those around as a
great way to beef up you he says he
carries 200 to be to charge up your
devices I mean that works really well
microSD I didn't end up using but
because I don't have one handy but I
would it would have been nice it should
be noted that the stock
Android or the not stock Android
operating system on this phone takes up
six to eight gigs of storage and if you
have a 16 gig phone it's not a lot of
storage left for things like movies and
music and movies particularly you are
going to want to watch on the five inch
screen on this guy because they look
awesome
there's your SIM slot right there which
doesn't come out or go in unless you
remove the battery which is kind of
smart because they don't want you
changing that around another than that
the only other thing left on the back is
the camera which is 13 megapixels and
it's one of those things where you know
you go go find side-by-side images on
the interwebs because they're all over
the place but in a nutshell the s4 is
able to take way more sharp images than
the HTC One which guys if you recall has
a four megapixel camera only but they're
ultra pixels their big pixels can take
way more sharp pictures in broad
daylight than the HTC One but the HTC
one blows it out of the water in terms
of low-light performance so it's all
about what's more important to you on
the side you've got your volume rocker
which I found way better than the HTC
one not nearly as good as my older
iPhone 4 because of how hard it is to
find it and correctly press it when it's
in your pocket that's when I'm usually
operating the volume rocker of my phone
when it you know when I wouldn't be able
to look at it and go like this so being
able to tell tactilely where it is and
which way I'm pressing it is really nice
HTC One really suffers in this way
you've got your headphone microphone
port on the top as well as I already
minard very very cool
there there s watch or whatever it is
they call it I didn't end up using it
because I have a TV but I have no TV
subscription no Netflix subscription no
Hulu subscription no YouTube
subscriptions now that YouTube's paid I
have nothing so I'm not much of a media
consumption guy I've watched two movies
since my baby was born The Hobbit which
was great except for the dwarves that
were singing for some reason I had no
idea what was going on with that and
yeah it looks giving me a facepalm right
now you know what it wasn't that great
and then the I also saw Skyfall which
was just horribly disappointing I mean a
Bond movie without a Bond girl people
are like wrong nor she was the blonde
girl yeah for like four minutes I mean
yeah to imply that James Bond only needs
a
girl for four minutes is I think not a
very fair thing to say about his anyway
so speaking of media consumption we have
a bit of an interesting thing to talk
about in this video if you could throw
that to me this my friends is a book I
got it three months ago I have not even
cracked open the cover
so when audible.com reached out to us
with an opportunity to do a free audio
book for our viewers thing where if you
go to audible.com slash Linus you can
get a free book so it's basically a
first month of your subscription free I
was like okay so the one that I used my
free block on was actually that one so
my plan is to I downloaded the app on my
phone so my plan is to listen to the
book while I fall asleep and as slick
knows normally I use Adventure Time to
fall asleep I don't actually watch the
show I just listen to it but I've made
my way completely through it I'm done
now so I need something else so I'm
gonna listen to this book instead of
reading it so guys feel free to go to
audible.com slash Linus get a free
audiobook download the app use it on
your computer use it in your car do
whatever it is you're gonna do you don't
have to get good to great by Jim Collins
which might not be what you're all
interested in but you can check out not
only New York Times bestsellers but also
audible zone bestsellers I mean there
trusted it's an Amazon service so it was
easy to use you can't really go wrong
all you do is like press the thing and
then all right
apparently it's music now as well but
there you go guys check it out moving
right along other bizarre features
things like s-health to me are one of
those things where it's like we fit
where the sales pitch is use this device
to be more healthy but the reality of it
is is if you already had like the
gumption and wherewithal to keep track
of your life to the degree of detail
that this application is going to
require you to do it they want you like
taking pictures of your food and
recording calories and and it's a
pedometer which is kind of cool it has
humidity and temperature sensor which is
cool but the kinds of people who would
actually be doing that are the kinds of
people who are probably already doing it
anyway and are probably fit and active
so I don't think that the s4 is going to
be the difference between being someone
who sits on the couch needs potato chips
and the difference between someone
that and someone who's like an active
healthy individual I don't think that's
gonna happen but there you go it's kind
of neat there's accessories coming
that'll make it easier to use and more
comprehensive but I think finally we're
gonna finish up with the physical
features of the phone so on the right
side you've got the lock button which is
a way way better position than the top
left of the HTC One because nine times
out of ten I go to press this I mash the
volume button so yeah there someone take
a cue from that and the lock button is
exactly how the volume button should be
because it's easy to feel and it has a
nice tactile press to it
speaking of buttons Samsung hasn't done
away with the three button approach to
the bottom so you've got your that went
away come back so you've got your
context menu you've got your much to
Google as children I'm sure you've got
your context menu down here your back
button as well as your dedicated home
button there's one feature that I
thought was cool but for some reason
isn't working for me right now but if
you hold the back button you can open up
their multi window display compatible
applications this comes over from the
note 2 and that works really well
because of the high resolution screen
well I'm when I was using it but now
it's not seeming to work for me right
now for some reason but that's the way
videos go is you want to demo something
and it just kind of dies umm the camera
the camera improvements are really
really cool on this phone so there's a
bunch of stuff that it does so there's
all these different modes honestly if
you're using it in stock mode you might
be missing out a little bit but and I
found myself doing that a fair bit just
and I'll explain why
best face is cool so it allows you to
sub out bad faces this is great for when
you're doing a group shot so when you
have time to tinker with the phone and
go oh I want drama mode which will
capture a bunch of different pictures
and then so you can see they have a
little snowboarder is an example like
that's something like a soccer ball
flying something along those lines
eraser takes random weird strangers out
of the back the other one that I thought
was great which one best best photo and
best face are the ones that I found most
useful however what I to capture the
moment unless you're staging something
or it's like a group picture where
you're getting a bunch of people
together I really found myself launching
the camera app and taking a picture
quickly go go go go go because you want
to capture that moment and be
the shutter speeds so fast you can just
go pppppp you can do your own best
picture and you can sort through it
after on your own that's what I actually
found myself doing however it's cool
that it has all these features and I
like that there I carry over from the
Galaxy camera Samsung's talked a lot
about Knox and the enhanced security
that it offers there was a great article
from just-in-case on Android police
where he basically said look don't worry
too much as basically what they're doing
is they're locking it down for the
people who aren't adept enough to get
past it but for those power users we're
still going to be okay we can still load
custom kernels that don't do those
security checks so you can choose
whether you have the customizability or
whether you have the locked down more
secure device it remains to be seen
how dedicated samsung really is to
keeping things custom and how dedicated
they are to making it and well more
locked down let's get into a couple more
of the motions and gestures just palm
motion I didn't end up really using
there's a couple of cool things here
though so you can mute and pause playing
sounds when the screen is on by turning
it over personally this bothers me a
little bit because I hate putting my
screen down on anything but if I had a
case for the phone then we'd be having a
different conversation about it they
have a case available that's actually
pretty cool as a little window so you
can see notifications speaking of
notifications smart alert which
basically will buzz when you pick up
your phone if there's something new
there you go I don't know if you guys
heard that but then it doesn't turn the
screen on which is like okay that's
great Samsung you told me there's
something new you didn't tell me what it
was so now I have to press the button
anyway which means I'm it's probably
easier for me like habit wise I already
just press the button immediately and
look at my phone all the time anyway so
so there's that what else stuff like
voice control has always felt kind of
goofy to me I didn't use it much if I
used my phone when I was driving more
than that might be something that I
would use and I did find that the voice
recognition for text voice to text was
outstanding better than anything I've
really used in the past although again I
have always kind of found it goofy and I
haven't really gone out of my way to use
it that much but it was something that
was actually usable unlike other stuff
that yeah I've seen in the past all
share is still here I don't think I've
ever seen anyone use it their group
play was really neat when I was at the
Samsung demo and there were like five
people sitting around a table with us
forest you know playing poker turning
every phone into a speaker and like you
know well this is the center channel
this is left and right channel I've
never found myself in a room with more
than maybe two galaxy users at the same
time particularly of the same model and
the way that Samsung segments their
software across different devices has
always really bothered me because from
my perspective I would think from their
perspective it would be better for them
to have this technology be supported
across all their devices so that it's
like the Samsung experience as opposed
to going well no the Galaxy s4 will have
four point two and the galaxy s3 will
have four point one and they will be
different because of that I mean there's
no reason they can't roll it out to the
s3 and yeah I'm still bitter about my
wife's galaxy s vibrant which was the
first galaxy that never even got Ice
Cream Sandwich because Samsung said oh
well there's not enough RAM and yet
third party app developers could do it
so I don't know I mean using software as
a way to differentiate platform to
platform
I was only slightly bitter about my
iPhone for not getting Siri because
everything else has been rolled out all
the way up to iOS 6 so yeah even Apple
for three-year-old plus devices is still
rolling out all the software so it'd be
great to see Samsung try to follow suit
but I understand that Android is a
little bit of a different beast in that
way group play on the other hand for
things like sharing music to wireless
portable speakers when compatible stuff
shows up is going to be really really
cool I think that's pretty much
everything that I wanted to talk about
yeah I hope you guys have enjoyed this
video at the end of the day if you're
looking for a conclusion I will be
sticking with my HTC one it's all about
the trade-off do you want the more
advanced features it's a faster
processor 1.9 versus 1.7 gigahertz do
you want the high megapixel camera or
the ultra pixel camera do you want
things like the gestures and the
temperature and humidity monitor and
s-health and all these features that
Samsung puts in to differentiate their
phones or do you want something that
really has that that feel like it's a
serious business to
I mean this is the first I've said this
before in my I switch to Android right
in 30 days with the HTC One coming from
iOS to Windows Phone 8 now to Android
I've said this already but this is the
first Android phone that I've really
touched that feels like an Apple phone
in terms of the quality I'm also it was
a huge step backwards for me going to a
rear-mounted speaker again from the boom
sound just really boom sound but the
front mounted speakers on the HTC One
you know going back to cupping my hand
behind the phone just really felt like
like I'd like going a generation back in
terms of the device so I'll take the
ergonomic quibble so that I have with
the HTC one it's not perfect I hate the
location of the lockscreen and I really
don't like the way the volume rocker
works for the overall higher build
quality although it should be noted that
Beats Audio isn't something that a lot
of people have asked me if the Beats
Audio one is great it's not that great
iPhone 4 has better sound quality
through the headphones than the Galaxy
s4 or the HTC One from my experience for
that matter so I think that pretty much
wraps it up thank you for checking out
my unboxing and really it was more of an
overview of my thoughts of the galaxy s4
