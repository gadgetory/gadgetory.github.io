at making a heat sink where we took a
reciprocating saw to a block of aluminum
with what could best be described as
limited success but of course
persistence is the name of the game here
at LMG so we went through the YouTube
comments which were full of suggestions
about casting our own heat sink from
molten aluminum and decided to set about
doing it but is that really the kind of
thing that you can do with a hundred
dollars worth of supplies and an empty
warehouse well there's only one way to
know for sure
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel there the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description so casting then I
guess we'll need a couch to know we're
talking about the kind of casting where
a molten material is poured into a mold
so that it solidifies in the desired
shape there are a couple of important
elements that you need a foam or plastic
replica of the intended finished design
and a material that you can mold around
it that can hold its shape the primary
design considerations for our heat sink
for how easy it would be to cast and how
much heat it could dissipate we kept it
as simple as possible in SolidWorks with
the two pieces coming off the heatsink
being to allow for the metal to be
poured into one end and the gases to
vent out of the other and the mold had
to be orientated in such a way that the
bottom would be the most likely surface
to have a smooth flat finish although
the fins ended up thicker than we'd have
liked when it comes to heat sinks size
matters and we calculated a theoretical
heat dissipation of over 200 watts so
then we went ahead and printed our
design using PLA plastic at a hundred
and three percent size to account for
the shrinkage of the aluminum during
cooling we chose PLA because it's made
from corn so when it burns it shouldn't
poison us to improve our odds of success
we needed casting grade aluminum but
buying that stuff new is pretty
expensive
fortunately there's a large source of
casting grade aluminum the scrap yard so
we headed there and picked out our
victim extracting the engine out of this
2002 Toyota Yaris back in the shop we
took apart the engine cleaned off the
dirt and chopped it into pieces small
enough to melt we used foam men to
extend our pouring and venting holes
then we mixed up clay sand and water
until it reached a consistency where it
was pliable but able to hold its shape
this mixture called green sand was
packed around the 3d print and then
baked for a couple of minutes to
partially melt the plastic and to harden
the clay this whole process is called
lost PLA casting we then placed the
aluminum scraps that we had into a
graphite crucible which is basically a
large cup that can withstand really high
temperatures and set about melting the
metal in a crude furnace that we made
out of fire bricks one of the best and
worst things about aluminum is that when
it's exposed to air it almost
immediately forms an aluminum oxide
layer on the surface this is good for
preventing further corrosion but it
makes it very annoying for melting so
it's important when casting then to
remove the aluminum oxide layer that
floats to the top called dross so that
it doesn't contaminate the finished cast
with the dross removed we were ready for
our first pouring attempt though it
should be noted we weren't sure how much
of the PLA had actually melted on this
one
turns out not much clearly the aluminum
barely made it into the mold and wasn't
able to melt much of the plastic in the
process so to troubleshoot then we made
a different riser design out of foam so
that the aluminum would be able to enter
across the entire top of the mold
greensand
melt purify and pour again and we ended
up once more with a face only a mother
could love so we moved on then from lost
PLA casting to lost foam casting which
is an extremely popular and much easier
way of creating molds do
to the low melting point of foam when
the aluminum is poured in it immediately
melted away and fills the space in
theory our for mold wasn't perfect by
any means but we were cautiously
optimistic that it would work so fire
melt and pour again and we get to see
what kind of a result we were going to
get unfortunately this wasn't a massive
success either although the foam did
melt away and we were able to create a
good base layer and even where the
mounting plate would be was fairly well
done we simply didn't have enough static
pressure to force the molten metal up
into the thin shapes we could solve this
by creating a much taller riser but by
this point the time crunch had become
real and our engineering department
realized that he needed to produce
something usable or I might melt him
down so he made a clay and firebrick
sandwich and assemble the mold using a
method that bears more purpose using a
method that bears more resemblance to
grade one art class than to precision
crafting to ensure on this the final
attempt that the metal would thoroughly
melt the furnace was remade and heated
until the entire crucible was red hot
upon pouring the aluminum into the mold
it started bubbling from the steam
escaping from the clay making the metal
of the finished products more porous a
problem we hadn't had before when we
were using green sand so then with a bit
of massaging from the reciprocating saw
to make it fit on a motherboard it was
finally ready to mount the processor
chosen was an Intel Q 6600 mainly
because the old asus motherboard it was
on was the only one where the heatsink
didn't interfere with the VRM
and to help fill in the air pockets on
the bottom of the heat sink
we added a more than generous dollop of
thermal paste topping off the creation
with a handful of zip ties and this was
actually the first time I laid eyes on
what three of my staff had been doing
all week
I don't know how anything could have
been worse than what I was expecting but
this may have achieved it I mean the
name of the series is getyou heat sinks
and I guess mission accomplished there
with all of that said testing and i-264
turned out better than expected and
sketchy heat sink number two was able to
keep the CPU reasonably cool for a
fairly long time although this is likely
more to do with its large thermal mass
then its ability to dissipate heat
ambitious but rubbish 10 out of 10
IGN so yeah in the end this turned out
to be the no man's sky of heat sinks
sure we had high goal set and we
believed with the resources we had we
could pull it off but it took three
times longer than originally planned
and the end result performs poorly looks
bad and has almost none of the features
that we said it would have in the
beginning so then all that's left to say
is thanks in advance to the metalworking
experts who by now has filled the
comments with advice we will bear it in
mind for the next installment then of
sketchy heat sinks FreshBooks
is the small business accounting
software it's built from the ground up
for how you work as a freelancer or a
small business owner and it's the simple
way to be more productive and organized
not to mention to get paid more quickly
and on your own terms you can take
deposits you can get paid faster you can
create and send professional-looking
invoices

your expenses you can even see when your
client has seen your invoice to put an
end to that oh did you send it no I
didn't see it la blah blah nonsense and
you can even take your payment directly
through fresh books if all that sounds
awesome you want to stop dinking around
