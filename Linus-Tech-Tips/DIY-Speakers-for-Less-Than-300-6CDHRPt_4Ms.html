spend a lot of time in peaceful solitude
contemplating the mysteries of the
universe and when you're not doing that
relaxing at home with a glass of white
wine listening to the soothing melodic
tones of your favorite artists on a
high-end speaker setup but when it comes
to home audio our high-priced
off-the-shelf designer models really
worth what they cost or is it possible
for someone without a lot of experience
and audio engineering or even
woodworking to put together a set of
speakers that can stand up to them for a
fraction of the cost let's find out
shall we
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description we set out to build a
set of try tricks MT MTL speakers that
we bought from Parts Express calm this
kit is one of the simpler ones and often
recommended for people just getting into
DIY audio and it checks off a couple of
key boxes for us promising high audio
fidelity at a relatively low cost and
while it's too early to say much about
sound quality the cost comparison looks
pretty good by building our own cabinets
rather than buying prefabbed ones we
shaved almost $100 off the price even
after accounting for buying our own
construction materials and renting the
tools we didn't have making our total
cost around a quarter of what I paid for
the CAF q 500s in my home theater that
we're going to compare against so let's
get started our cabinet is slightly
different from the one that would be
supplied by parts Express as we ended up
adopting some modifications suggested by
regalia Knox comm if you're interested
in reading about his experience building
the same speaker set and a more in-depth
guide to construction check out the link
below
we built both speakers out of one four
by eight sheet of MDF board cut into two
by four strips for ease of
transportation we first marked out all
the pieces we intended to get out of
each sheet then cut them with a
combination of the table and circular
saw a good carpenter will tell you
measure twice cut once and while that's
undeniably great advice here in the
studio we tend to follow the cut pray
love then keep on cutting philosophy
that I learned from that doctor that I
used to visit back when I wasn't covered
by the company health plan I don't know
if I'm going to let Tyler write these
scripts anymore anyway once we cut all
of these we needed to put holes for the
woofers and tweeters in the cut of wood
that will be the front of the
speaker I'm sure there's a specific name
for that piece but I don't want to
baffle you or me with too much audio
terminology so we'll just call it the
front we used a router and a jig to get
the circle cuts and recesses if you want
tips on how to make your own jig for
doing circular cuts like this check out
this link with all our pieces ready it's
time to stick them together we want to
leave one side off the cabinet for now
so that we still have access to do all
of our wiring protip it's very important
to drill pilot holes which we totally
nailed and to use cabinet screws with
countersunk holes in the first place so
you don't have to go back and redo them
to end up with a more clean look with
our cabinet fully constructed the next
stage is to put together our crossover
the crossover is the part of your sound
system that takes the single input
signal coming from your stereo computer
TV or what have you and that breaks it
up into multiple output signals
containing different frequency bands
that are then sent to the specialized
loudspeakers best equipped to handle
them our try tricks kit contains two
woofers and one tweeter woofers handle
lower audio frequencies while tweeters
are designed to handle the higher end of
the spectrum you can learn more about
this here the try tricks uses a
second-order crossover which means it
uses a double filter to separate out the
frequencies one two the woofers and one
two the tweeter when building a
crossover with multiple inductors it's
important to set them up so the
inductors don't talk to each other this
has nothing to do with our constant fear
of a machine uprising by allowing
electronics to communicate but rather to
do with preventing the two coils from
creating mutual inductance by being
orientated in the same direction in
order to avoid that we're going to lay
one horizontally and the other one up
vertically then once you've soldered all
the connections between your inductors
capacitors and
found you can place the crossover in the
cabinet mount your speakers and wire it
all together to avoid having excess wire
cluttering up your interior drop wires
down from your speaker and cut them at
the appropriate length to meet up with
your crossover the woofers in this
system are wired in series which means
their resistance is added together
increasing the overall resistance that
the amplifier sees and letting it run
cooler and more efficiently
after the wiring is all taken care of we
just stuffed this baby full of nylon
fiber and seal it back up at this point
a master carpenter might go straight
into painting or covering the cabinets
with vinyl but we're going to have to do
a little bit of cosmetic tweaking and
much like my aesthetician our primary
tools are going to be polyfill and a
power sander
now that these speakers look a little
more like the version I saw on Pinterest
it's time to find out how well they
perform our three lucky volunteers were
blindfolded and subjected to these
speakers and my Q 500s and they were
then asked if they could tell which was
which and to score the audio quality on
a scale of one to ten one sounded like
sharper like the high notes are like all
a little bit clearer but the second one
it sounded better in the low but the it
was just kind of drowned out in the
middle let's go first one like an eight
okay and then the second one like a six
okay I think first one was better get on
the ladder and more sharp I got kind of
more dull and I think I break them
probably seven and six the second set
was okay in the highs in the mid so it's
still a little cloudy to me and it was
in desperate need of a subwoofer for me
I do have a first one like seven and a
half
so there you have it in the end our
subjects could tell the difference but
our DIY build came in only slightly
beneath the speakers that I spent a
large chunk of my youtube money on for
my birthday
earlier this year so if you're looking
to put together an audio system
I'd recommend saving a considerable
amount of money by putting it together
yourself although I would add the caveat
that if you really want to make sure you
end up with a solid final product it's
probably worth it to pick up a kit with
pre-cut cabinet pieces unless you are
extremely confident in your woodworking
skills just like how if you're not 100%
