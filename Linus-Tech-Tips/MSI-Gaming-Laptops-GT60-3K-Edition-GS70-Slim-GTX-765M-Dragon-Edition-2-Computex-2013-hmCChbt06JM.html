powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM so we're checking out some msi
systems here that are looking pretty
freakin crazy so number one is the gt70
dragon edition 2 extreme so what makes a
notebook extreme you might ask I would
answer well the fact that it has an
Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition inside
that would be the obvious answer the
next answer is the fact that it has a
GTX 780 M inside so that's about as
powerful as it gets for a mobile
graphics card my third answer might be
that it has what they're calling their
exclusive super raid 2 which is 3 M SATA
SSDs and raid 0 and a 750 gigabyte hard
drive for mass storage and last but not
least with their cooler boosts - as well
as their special hybrid power design
this notebook is capable of overclocking
that normally 3 gigahertz core i7
Extreme Edition all the way up to 4
point 1 gigahertz what you do is you
boot it up with a special hotkey and you
can actually run it at significantly
higher clock speeds now this is going to
exceed the amount of power that a device
like oh it looks like we have an
external mouse plugged in so there's a
yeah there's a touchpad off button here
we go I got it you can turn the touchpad
off so you don't accidentally hit it
with your palm if you don't want to do
that so here's the hybrid power design
so what this does is if you exceed the
amount of power that can be drawn from
AC it in short bursts it'll actually
allow the notebook battery to boost it
up so you can maintain that extremely
high performance level regardless of
anything else it uses a 17.3 inch full
HD screen and there is definitely more
to come in terms of pool MSI notebooks
stay tuned I've been complaining for so
long that displays are not high
resolution enough what is the freakin
excuse for being able to put a 1080p
display on this and only being able to
put a 1080 to split but wait hold on
this isn't a 1080p display this is a 3k
addition so what this is is it's a
notebook that finally ups the ante in
terms of resolution 2880 by 1620 so you
can see those icons are pretty
well what you also might be able to see
although it's hard to say because we're
shooting this in 1080p is that the
display is significantly sharper so what
unless I had to do is they first of all
they had to put a higher resolution
display in here next they had to back it
up with performance so this one also
this is the GT 633 Kay it also features
a core i7 extreme edition processor it's
got 16 gigs of ddr3 memory an nvidia
geforce gtx 780 m graphics card with
four gigs of gddr5 Ram why do you need 4
gigs of DDR 5 Ram well that's the issue
here is that when you increase the
resolution this is what everyone's been
afraid to do for so long when you
increase the resolution you increase the
hardware requirement in order to drive
it and actually have a great gaming
experience on the device so they had to
put in all that graphics memory because
as you increased resolution you need
more vram to buffer the textures that
you require now you also get some other
cool functionality with the gtx 780
check out these three displays that are
running right here all three of them are
actually running off of this display so
it has support for invidious 3 plus 1 so
that is Nvidia surround over three
displays with an auxiliary display
giving you up to 4 display outputs off
of a single notebook so this is a 15
point 5 inch model and honestly this is
sort of just the beginning here so we
still got the SteelSeries multi backlit
keyboard but I want to move on I want to
move on I love 3k and that's all sort of
great and fine and interesting but check
this out this is a whole new concept
when it comes to gaming notebooks it's
slim it's gorgeous
it's aluminium and it is a 17.3 inch
gaming notebook with a gtx 765 m a core
i7 it's got that same super raid
technology we talked about before and
when you fold this baby down she is less
than one inch in overall thickness so
I'll do my trademark cell phone size
comparison here to give you guys some
idea so you're gonna see how it puts on
the side you've got Ethernet HDMI dual
display port USB 3 as well as audio
ports and on the other side over here
you probably won't be able to look
but we've got two USB 3 actually I can
turn this around we've got an SD card
slot as well as cooling so check out the
bottom of it fully aluminum on the
bottom of it as well so ventilation
comes in here and the way are still able
to cool the core i7 CPU as well as the
GTX 765 m if you were looking for a
notebook that is stylish as well as
high-performance and you don't mind the
size I mean I guess if you want the
large screen then you definitely want
the size then you may not have to look
any further than the GS 70 from msi can
you see the backlit keyboard from the
side here so it's a bit of a redesigned
backlit keyboard there's a different
typeface on it as well as a chiclet key
design that was necessitated by the
extreme slimness of the form factor of
this notebook thank you for checking out
