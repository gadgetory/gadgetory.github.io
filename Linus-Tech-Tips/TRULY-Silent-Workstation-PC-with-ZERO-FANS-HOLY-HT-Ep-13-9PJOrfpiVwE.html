this box has a workstation PC sort of
gaming PC in it yes I am in fact it came
all the way from France and was sent to
us by a company called kaleo's who
specializes in silent cooling yes my
friends cooling with no fans no pumps no
water get that you go out of here oh
there it is and oh okay and no real
chance of extracting this thing on my
own I'm gonna go round up a posse move
right back
mass drop is now featuring the new
flagship I am from DS at 80 featuring a
six point eight millimeter dynamic
driver check them out at the link in the
video description so the first thing I
want to know is why couldn't I move this
exactly how heavy is this bastard so
let's take it over to the scale here if
you can help guide me on drew it yep oh
wow
seventy-two and a half pounds for this
bastard seventy two and a half pounds
what kind of what kind of bullcrap is
that like what is going on in here well
let's have a look at exactly what's
going on in here so we've got a 5820k
processor we've got four dims of what is
that yeah HyperX predator ddr4 memory
we've got an msi x99s sli plus we've got
this is a 500 watt super flower passive
power supply we've got an SSD and
finally we've got a GTX 1080 but none of
that I mean especially given this isn't
an aluminum case it's not even heavy
none of that accounts for the weight so
the weight all seems to come from Cali
OSes cooling solution so this is a
gigantic what looks and feels like
aluminum heatsink all across the back of
the case here it's got to be about
two-and-a-half three inches thick with
these gigantic fins and a secret sauce
inside that they specifically
contractually forbidden me to open and
look closely at but the basic principle
is on their site instead of what you
might normally use in a heat pipe which
is sometimes even water they're actually
using a refrigerant called HSC 245f a so
this is Penta fluoro propane yes I had
to look at a cheat sheet in order to
remember that they're using that along
with these these capillaries you can
actually see them here passing from the
heatsink over to the CPU area and then
there'd be another one down by the GPU
so they're using
these these presumably copper tubes that
are carrying fluid down the one side so
that'll go in the fluid side to the CPU
block then what happens is it's
evaporating here and the vapor is going
out this way now they're able to move it
without a pump thanks to a very similar
principle to how heat pipes work and
that is like these micro pores in the
metal itself how they keep it
directional how they have it flowing
fast enough in order to achieve the
temperatures they claim on their website
though that is still a mystery to me so
naturally I'm not just going to take
their word for it but the basic premise
here is pretty straightforward
Kalle Oakes is using the same technology
that got them four and a half million
euros of investment funding back in 2014
to take the technology that they
developed for data center cooling that
basically eliminates the problems with
air that is that it's hard to direct the
heat somewhere that you want it to go
and it's not as effective and the
problems with water which is that
maintenance is an absolute nightmare and
bring it to the desktop so no moving
parts no noise and they claim great
performance that's cool
I mean I don't know how cool it is it's
really quiet that's for sure so step one
with my test bench drive installed is
going to be to let it sit for like half
an hour and idle because I want to know
what kind of temperatures it runs at
when we're not putting any kind of load
on it like if you were just you know
using a word document for example and
that is not bad
so the CPU sitting around 39 degrees the
GPU sitting at around 30 degrees but of
course idle is not the test of a cooling
solution so the next thing I'm going to
do is throw up an IEEE 264 test where we
put it under loads and would you look at
that 45 minutes later CPU still sitting
at 67 degrees on the pack
and perhaps even more impressively I
mean these are like decent air cooler
temps perhaps even more impressively is
that the heatsink is handling that load
with pretty much no difficulty
whatsoever so you can look at these
thermal camera shots and see that even
our hottest point is well within what I
would consider to be the comfort zone
so that leads us then to our last test
Crysis 3 I want to sit and run this game
let's launch margin I want to run this
game for one hour and see if it can
still hold up when we dump all that GPU
heat load into the system ok so we're
back for the end of our one hour GPU
test although I should probably point
out that it's actually been three days
though that's even more impressive
because check this out not only is our
game still running yep not only is our
game still running but it's actually
still running at 80 fps which means that
whatever the thermals are of the rest of
the system it's at least not thermal
throttling so I'm going to whip out the
thermal camera and get all the readings
that I need in order to put together
kind of an after test for you guys so
the GPU the CPU memory
I want that vrm solution that like
homemade vrm solution up there as well
as the power supply and finally I want
to get readings from the back Wow
honestly I think this might be the most
impressive part the hottest point on
this entire finna rake you home I can
barely move it okay the hottest point on
this entire thin array is down here at
about 44 degrees Celsius so to put that
in perspective the entire thing it you
can feel the heat coming off it like an
aura but the entire thing is not so warm
that
uncomfortable to touch which is just
mind-blowing like okay we'll deal with
that later in the meantime back to the
system so I first heard about this back
in July there was a post on the forum
and it was like oh these guys claim to
have a completely silent workstation I
kind of went oh yeah right this is
always being claims but as soon as you
put a fan or a pump in a system it is
not silent and for that matter even this
one with no moving parts in the cooling
system is not silent because you can
hear a little bit of electrical noise
and like electrical switching noise in
the power supply even though this is
nothing close to what I would consider
to be coil whine but what it is is
phenomenally quiet like to the point
where you can only hear that stuff
because it's so quiet and even more
impressively this is where I really got
shot GPU temps at 99 percent usage of 65
degrees 65 degrees CPU package
temperatures of 55 degrees it not only
is a silent cooler but it actually
outperforms
most other cooling solutions that I have
seen sort of like high-end water cooling
with like a triple or quadruple radiator
of course I don't entirely expect you
guys to take my word for it so I'm going
to fire up my digital sound level meter
and let's fire up our game okay so this
tells us not a whole hell of a lot other
than that when I talk even from over
here we see peaks of about 80 decibels
we need to get somewhere quieter away
from our server room what is this a
computer I've never seen I keep sync
this ball is like a car heat sink
it's actually nothing like a car heat
sink car heat sinks have a very high fin
per inch count
why are these not aligned
I'm there any cats at the office they
would be all over this thing it's
probably true it's just good to just
gaff tape it just gaff like that on half
tape it that won't work you don't go get
the gaff tape I will forget it let's
just move it I know that I'm having a
great time where are we going okay but
you're in the wrong spot hey it is
quieter back here okay so at about 35
decibels this is the quietest spot in
our warehouse so we'll plug the system
in and power it on and that made no
difference whatsoever okay
well that's cool Linus it actually works
holy cow how do I get one um that's kind
of a complicated answer they say and I
believe them because if you look closely
at their website this is clearly the
exact same system that's in all of their
promotional materials that this is the
only prototype in existence right now I
suspect this is just kind of like a
weird side project for one of the people
who works there but they do have plans
beyond the availability of this
configuration if you buy a whole system
if you like contact them for pricing
they do have plans to release something
in the future for they're saying about
five hundred bucks for the cooler and a
custom enclosure that you'd be able to
integrate your own system into my figure
that'll be available sometime around CES
of this year but in the meantime this is
a very cool proof-of-concept and a very
heavy proof of concept and I hope you
guys enjoyed this episode of holy a
legitimately fanless computer well
there's lots of fanless computers but
this one has a GTX 1080 in it so thanks
for watching guys if you just like this
video hit that dislike button but if you
liked it hit the like button get
subscribed maybe even consider checking
out where to button okay you won't be
buying one of these on
anytime soon but uh we have our link to
Amazon in the video description also in
the video description we've got our
merch store we can buy cool shirts like
this one we've got our community forum
which you should totally join and
probably other things to go check it out
it's great highly recommend it what do I
else do I normally say right when you're
done doing all that stuff you can check
