power supply in the world the ax 1500 I
from Corsair is winning recommendations
and Editors Choice Awards all over the
place including the first ever perfect
10 out of 10 at my favorite power supply
review site
Johnny guru.com and the reason goes far
beyond its 80 plus titanium efficiency
rating a global leader in tech
recruiting is celebrating geek pride by
giving away 10 amazing tech prizes for
more info visit the modus Facebook page

but what's 80 plus titanium lioness I've
never heard of that before let alone
seen a product with that sticker on the
box
great question 80 plus certification
showed up that one very little attention
was being paid to the relatively low
efficiency of power supplies at the time
something that caused pcs to output more
heat and consume more electricity it
started out as a quick and dirty
certification that promised a power
supply would be at least eighty percent
efficient at low medium and full load so
twenty fifty and a hundred percent since
then even though the ATX 2.0
specification only requires efficiency
in the 65 to 70 range performance power
supply makers have continued to strive
for greater and greater efficiency
80-plus titanium is currently the
highest bar to strive for enquires
efficiency of 90% 92% 94% and 90 percent
at loads of 10% 20% 50% and a hundred
percent respectively aside from the
debatable importance of titanium versus
platinum gold or silver efficiency from
a power bill savings perspective though
one amazing thing about this unit is
that due to its efficiency it can
actually deliver its entire capacity off
of a normal 15 amp circuit so you don't
have to get a fancy high current outlet
installed in your house just to max out
your power supply like what we've seen
in the past efficiency isn't the only
story when it comes to performance
though some 80 plus power supplies are
efficient
but suffer from poor voltage regulation
and excessive ripple which can cause
instability and damage or even destroy
your other components in the long term
not an issue here though even though low
ripple and strong voltage regulation are
more difficult to achieve with higher
capacity power supply units Corsairs use
of a state-of-the-art DSP allows the X
1500 I to dynamically manage its own
performance to achieve a no compromises
experience for its users and you also
get to use coarser link to monitor power
in power efficiency although I suppose
they just derive that from the first to
fan speed temperatures and even send
yourself emails if any of those things
go out of whack Nido physically the
first thing I noticed taking the unit
out of its box is how large it is at 224
millimeters long it's the biggest power
supply that I've ever used and one of
the biggest I've ever seen make sure if
you're planning to buy one that there's
room in your case for not only the unit
but also the modular cables that need to
stick out of the end of it the sides are
unadorned save for the Corsair ax
branding and on the top you won't find
much of anything other than a simple
sticker with a breakdown of how much of
the unit's total capacity can be
delivered on each of the main rails as
well as the usual safety certifications
of note here is that the entire 1500
watt capacity can be delivered on the 12
volt rail set sail for graphics card
city am i right the fan on the bottom is
a custom 140 millimeter unit with a
fluid dynamic bearing and a blade design
that is optimized for maximum airflow at
low noise levels
I mean honestly though I don't know why
anyone bothers putting this on their fan
packaging anymore isn't that about like
saying a car is optimized for maximum
power with great fuel economy I mean who
is optimizing their fans for minimum
airflow at maximum noise levels anyway
that's not the main selling point of the
fan for me anyway I'm more interested in
the fact that it doesn't even turn on
until around 30% load so your power
supply can be kicking out 400 plus watts
of power and be running completely
fanless ly silent neat at the back is a
honeycomb grille a standby switch and
that
usual larger c19 power cord socket and
then finally on the opposite end we've
got the modular interface with a
whopping 19 connectors with varying
levels of usefulness the normal stuff is
here 24-pin connector six peripheral
connectors that can be used to connect a
total of 24 SATA and molex devices with
five quad SATA cables and three quad
mullux cables included in the box we've
got two spots for eight pin CPU
connectors and what wait a minute that's
ten eight pin sockets that can be used
to connect up to ten PCI Express eight
pin connectors and two EPs eight pin
connectors at the same time more on that
in a moment
wrapping things up back here we've got a
self-test button a USB port for corsair
link software monitoring and another
monitoring port alright so back to those
PCIe connectors Corsair includes a great
variety of ribbon style flat black PCIe
cables to accommodate almost any kind of
configuration you've got four standard
lengths single 6 + 2 s2 longer single 6
+ 2 s and then - double 6 + 2 s which
are fine for most parts that have two
connectors to reduce cable clutter so
you're just running one cable but don't
try to use those ones on an r9 295x2
you'll want to run two separate cables
for that because it consumes so much
power now I wouldn't have minded Corsair
mixing things up a little bit in terms
of the variety of the other included
cables maybe a couple of dulce de Zoar
like a variation or two with tighter
spacing between the connectors or
something like that but this is a very
minor complaint and overall the modular
cables included give you a lot of
flexibility in terms of cable management
when building your PC no matter what
kind of case you're using and they look
absolutely fantastic with every single
one of them not just the PCI Express
ones but even the 24 pin being that flat
ribbon style with all black wires very
very nice now I'm going to break
tradition a little bit here and do the
conclusion of this video before the
actual end so stay tuned to find out why
but here it goes do you need this power
supply no
course not whatever it can do there are
other less expensive ways to do that's
it that's all there is to it
but do you want this power supply the
fact that you're still watching this
video would indicate that perhaps you do
and not entirely without cause yes there
are other ways to deliver 1500 watts of
power to a PC but they lack the elegance
sex appeal and sheer technological wow
factor of this one so there you have it
it's the best and it comes with a price
tag to match but at least you get a
seven year warranty this sweet cloth bag
and a case badge that you can stick to
your case with pride because you
officially have a two hundred and twenty
four millimeter EP you can't even see
what I'm doing but I think you guys know
what it is but of course you didn't come
to Linus tech tips to hear about my
decades of experience as an electrical
engineer and see a detailed teardown of
the power supply nope we're going to be
doing a packaging test as a follow-up to
my ever-popular test on the ax 1200 I
where I threw it out of a moving vehicle
but this time we're upping the ante this
is the aptly-named 400 yard water
balloon launcher from BAM launcher pick
this up on Amazon and we are going to be
flicking a power supply with it so I've
got my lovely assistants Luke and Nick
the power supply is in here we are going
to show you the power supply when we're
done with this but the point of this
exercise is uh let's just you haven't
tried this before so you'll have to just
bear with us we're on the roof here
are you guys good yeah oh that's
unfortunate so it's not really designed
for power supplies and more for water
balloons but I think still think it
performed admirably given the
circumstances you can see that the
folded-over marketing flap didn't
actually fare that well in the in the
fall and the oh wow yeah the outer
carton in general is just kind of coming
apart here in fact the inner carton is
having a little bit
the trouble here as well but let's go
ahead and so the point of this is you
know what you're going to spend a bunch
of money on a super you know high end
power supply you want to make sure that
when it arrives you're actually going to
be powering up your rig with it as
opposed to dealing with shipping damage
RMA so you can see here the cables
themselves immaculate the power supply
and it's okay my cat chewed on it but
other than that pristine huh soft foam
totally not damaged capable of handling
multiple Falls and the power supply
itself once again Corsairs packaging
exceeds no loose parts my expectations
in fact a lot of the internals of this
power supply to even check out in
they're actually like glued in or
siliconed in so I was I was pretty
confident it was going to survive but of
course following from this kind of a
height or wherever it fell from eyes
there's no guarantees alright guys so if
you enjoyed that kind of goofing around
then I've got great news we have
officially named our new toys games and
challenges channel so if you want to see
more of it you can head over to channel
