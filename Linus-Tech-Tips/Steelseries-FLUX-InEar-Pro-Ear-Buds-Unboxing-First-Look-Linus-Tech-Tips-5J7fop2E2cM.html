look on - tech tips we're going to be
using our fancy-pants dual camera setup
and today we're gonna be having a look
at the flux in ear pro from SteelSeries
and so it's getting distracted because
he was looking down at the box but he
doesn't have to because we have two
cameras now
so basically SteelSeries has a lot on
the go in terms of audio products
they've got their over the ear
headphones but this is the first time
we've really seen and in the ear
headphone product from them so what
separates this from other headphones in
a similar price range well SteelSeries
is saying that the most important things
about this guy are the fact that they
have balanced armature drivers okay so
what that means is a very flat response
in fact they even have a helpful little
graph here on the box that shows you a
more typical headphone frequency
response versus the flux in ear pros
which is very very flat so according to
diesel who is actually in some ways a
bit more of an audio nerd than slick and
who is more of an audio nerd than myself
this is good because it means that you
can use a software equalizer or other
kinds of voodoo magic in order to
achieve sort of a more poppy sound or a
more bass heavy sound as long as you
know that the headphones or earbuds that
you're using are flat then in the
adjustments you make are not going to
accidentally over compensate for what
was essentially a deficiency in the
product itself we've also got an inline
microphone and controls so it is still
functional as a headset and can be used
for music or gaming with a mobile PC or
a Mac because it just uses three a three
and a half millimeter plug not just a
three-and-a-half millimeter plugged more
on that later so here's what they have
to say balanced armature technology
offers an incredible audio experience
the highly accurate drivers alive you
hear new layers levels subtle details
and rediscover your games and music so
we're not gonna let this unboxing finish
without slick actually taking some time
to compare these IEMs against sort of
his experience because he's the one who
tried them at the SteelSeries suite
where we picked these up and overall his
impressions were very very positive
although I'd love for diesel to try them
out as well cool thing about these is
they actually come with a variety of
different ear tips
so it's normal for these earbuds to come
with sort of a small medium and large
but these ones actually come with comply
foam tips as well so silicon tips are
good for sort of isolating noise which
is which is great and they are
reasonably comfortable okay a lot of
people don't find silicon tips
reasonably they're silicon silicon tips
reasonably comfortable at all which is
why comply tips are a very very popular
choice so comply tips actually use a
foam a memory foam that you can squeeze
and then it will expand in your ear to
make it extremely comfortable as well as
to make it form a very tight seal so it
comes with a Quick Start Guide although
quite frankly if you need a Quick Start
Guide to operate your headphones and you
probably need some help although in
their defense these headphones do
actually have a couple of nuances that
make them a little bit tricky so in
terms of included accessories we've got
a carrying case which has the head
earbuds themselves inside you can see
there they are with their little oh
that's kind of cool check this out so it
has a Velcro surface here and then the
band that you can use to wrap up the
headphones has velcro on the outside of
it as well so it'll actually stick there
okay and you can take things like extra
ear tips or extra cable adapters or
whatever else you want and throw them in
there nice and soft kind of like a
little tiny purse if you catch my drift
okay there's that little carrying strap
that we have with the velcro the
SteelSeries SteelSeries sticker inside
alright a couple of little bits and
pieces here so this is kind of important
so SteelSeries whole thing with the flux
in your pros is that they went back to
the drawing board in terms of ergonomics
and instead they I think what they say
they picked up like a hundred and fifty
earbuds or something stupid like that
like some ridiculous number I don't
remember how many it was but they bought
a bunch of earbuds when they were trying
to figure out the ergonomics and tried
them all and basically well we don't
really like any of them so back to the
drawing board they decided to look back
at hearing aids something that's
actually designed to be worn all day in
order to determine how they wanted these
to fit so hearing aids often go over the
year and I apologize these are slicks
but I'm totally
put them in so hopefully these idea
these aren't the silicon tips that he
wants to use so the way that they work
is they're they're labeled in terms of
left and right so I'm gonna hold this
one up so that diesel can have a look
right here so there's a little R or an L
on the inside hopefully you guys can see
that I think that you can oh I'm
covering it that's why you can't see it
there it is right there little R and L
and then what what it does is it goes
over and around your ear much like some
of the very high-end earbuds are better
out there or like something like hearing
aids they also include an accessory so
this is just a little sort of rubber
strip thing here that acts as a guide so
if you don't like the feel of the thin
wires hanging on your ears then you can
actually wrap them in this there's just
a little slit in the top of it and then
it'll be a bit of a thicker piece that
sits over top of the ear which should
help it be a little bit more comfortable
for those who aren't really used to this
whole approach to things so where was I
going with that right included
accessories so there you go you've got
your medium small and large tips and
then these guys right here so these are
the comply foam tips and I'm going to
switch to the other camera here so you
can have a look at these so the way that
you're supposed to use these is you
actually squish them up into a tighter
sort of ball like that and then you wait
for them to expand inside your ear now
they don't last forever
unlike normal silicone ear tips which
will last for a really really long time
these should be replaced probably every
few months if you use them frequently
but they're not actually all that
expensive so you know it's up to you
both options are included you can try
the complies you can use them if you
want or you can just not end up using
them over the long term and you can
stick with the silicone ones which will
last pretty much forever or until they
become sort of a hygiene issue which is
I don't know for gamers is that an issue
is a hygiene issue a thing all right
other included accessories were almost
done here so there's a little
proprietary connector on the end here
that actually serves a very distinct
purpose so you can plug in either here
we go sorry I know I'm covering up the
camera here and there's nothing diesel
can do about it there you can plug in
either a three-banded three-and-a-half
millimeter so that'll carry your your
your microphone and your head
signals through one connector or you can
use the other included connector to plug
it into a PC or other sort of more
conventional device where you have to
separate two banded connectors so you
can swap those out and I would like it
to be noted that this is actually one of
the better non tangle cables I've seen
in the past so it's quite a bit thicker
which actually gives us some additional
weight so when it's hanging off of your
ears the good news is it doesn't hang
right out of the ear tips out of your
ear canals themselves because it wraps
around your ear but it gives us some
extra weight so it pulls a little more
than normal but because of its thickness
you can actually crumple it up in a
little ball stuff it in your pocket so
we're gonna hope that this live demo
actually works pretty well whoops and
then you can untangle it in a matter of
sort of less than less than seconds so
that's a good thing as well on the I
believe it's the left ear button on the
left ear but you've got that inline
volume control as well as microphone
that I talked about before so I'm gonna
give you guys a close look at that so
all that is pretty straightforward so
there's the microphone on the back and
there is the integrated controls on the
front and I don't know if we're missing
anything at this point so let me just
see we've got all the accessories we've
got the general features right so
basically SteelSeries this whole thing
with this is that for the price which is
in sort of the mid hundreds range it
should pretty much blow the doors off
anything else that's out there so we're
gonna take a moment and let these guys
try it out after much testing in our
audio laboratory studio um actually most
like forgot his phone as he yes so his
music library is conveniently not here
however diesel I spent some time with it
so my point of comparison is my clip
chest for eyes which I know aren't
fantastic earbuds by any stretch of the
imagination overall I'd say if I had to
pick something where the flux in air
pros just utterly destroyed the s4 eyes
it would be in terms of bass however I
didn't sound just sort of bumi and
ridiculous like a lot of IMS or a lot of
headphones do especially if they're
oriented towards gamers diesels a bit of
an earbuds diva so he uses Sennheiser ie
ates which are obviously a much more
expensive pair of earphones than these
ones so here's a whole take on it was
and they're not as goes my IE eights but
if we had to make you draw a conclusion
that wasn't based on just sort of being
a diva diesel it would be probably what
something along the lines of very
competitive for the price compared to
the I apes okay so he's he's giving he's
giving me the thumbs up so I'd like to
show you guys that I did install the the
metal arm metal piece yeah the metal
piece that like you know straps to your
head and you'd nail it in place I know
the rubber piece right here but actually
for me made them quite a bit more
comfortable now there's the obvious
problem where if you scrunch them up and
put them in your pocket and they come
off or you have to adjust them in any
way then they might be a little bit
inconvenient but I would say for me
personally the comfort factor is
definitely improved by by adding those
so I think that pretty much wraps things
up thanks for checking out this unboxing
and first look at the SteelSeries flux
in ear pro guys i've been saying this
for a long time about my seven HS but
it's time to stop thinking of steel
series as gaming audio because they're a
cut above what anyone else in the gaming
headset space is doing in terms of audio
quality with particular emphasis on the
seven H's and now the flux in ear pros
