computers for content creators at CES
2016 first up is the Lenovo ThinkPad P
40 yoga this is designed for serious
content creation on-the-go as it's got a
Quadro M 500 M GPU they collaborated
with Wacom on the included pen which can
detect 2048 separate levels of pressure
and it features a 1440p IPS display that
includes tactile feedback to feel more
like writing on real paper it comes with
a skylake core i7 and up to 512 gigs of
SSD storage and is expected to be
available in q1 of 2016 for $13.99 the
msi vortex is next have you ever found
yourself wanting a workstation that
looks kind of like a Mac Pro and is
super-powerful like a Mac Pro but isn't
a Mac well here it is the windows-based
cylinder from MSI it features a skylake
core i7 desktop processor to desktop gtx
980 s and can hold two nvme m dot two
drives now although there isn't a xeon
processor or a Quadro or fire pro
graphics card that you might find in a
more traditional content creation
workstation it's very powerful for the
size and from our experience programs
like Adobe Creative Cloud make more use
of CUDA than they necessarily do of the
Quadro features anyway it's got plenty
of connectivity for USB 3.1 to mini DPS
to USB 3.1 type C's with Thunderbolt and
it's very quiet as well with MSI quoting
low 30 decibels under load the high-end
version will run about four thousand
dollars the way less extreme
configuration will go for about half of
that it's expected to be available later
this year our third choice if you were
thinking what do you mean no cuadros no
Zeon's well you'll be happy here are the
lenovo p 50 and p 70 mobile workstations
if you are looking for the ultimate
editing or rendering rig that you can
take with you these are what you want
they've got 4k displays with Pantone
color correction as well as thunder
well three in case you know one 4k
screen just isn't enough for you and the
difference between the P 50 and the P 70
is the size of the screen so you can
either get a 15.6 inch or a 17 inch
you also get three drive bays with the P
50 and four with the P 70 so you have
plenty of room for storing video or 3d
models the P 50 starts at $1,600 and the
P 70 at 2000 these ones are available
now next up is the HP EliteBook folio it
looks a heck of a lot like a MacBook but
I assure you it is a Windows PC and
although this is not the most powerful
thing out there and not strictly
speaking a you know content creation
computer from a video editing
perspective it's got a an Intel Core M
instead of like an i7 it also has some
nice features for serious users who
create content let's say for example by
writing it or by generating business
proposals it's got a great sound system
that HP says they optimized with Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen for those oh so important
business Skype calls it's got a 180
degree hinge allowing it to fold flat on
a table for collaboration and it also
features Thunderbolt 3 so exec two more
displays easily and comes with either a
4k or 1080p display option they're
quoting 10 hours of battery life on the
1080p model without quoting anything for
the 4k making it great for quote unquote
creators who are writing on the go it
starts at $9.99 and is expected to be
available in March our final content
creator PC the P 37 XV 5 or P 37 WV 5 is
actually classified by its manufacturer
gigabyte as a gaming laptop but
personally I'm seeing the content
creator side of this as well depending
on which of the models you opt for
you'll get a 980 m or gtx 970m graphics
card you will get a core i7 6700 HQ and
you will get either a 4k Ultra HD IPS
display or a 1080p IPS display but where
this one gets interesting - the content
creator
is the performance of the aforementioned
display they are quoting 100% Adobe RGB
coverage making this awesome for working
with photo or video editing in Adobe it
features MDOT two PCIe SSD storage ddr4
memory USB 3.1 type C and the usual
gaming creature comforts like a backlit
keyboard and programmable macro keys
also something that's just as good for
content creation as it is for gaming
just ask Karen who keeps multiple
keyboards on his desk at the office so
