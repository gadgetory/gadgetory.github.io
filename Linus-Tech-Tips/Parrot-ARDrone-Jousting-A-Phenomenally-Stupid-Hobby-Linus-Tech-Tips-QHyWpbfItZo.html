and I are gonna both be using tablets
like hold up your tablet so this is
gonna be the ultimate iPad versus
Android tablet showdown because I'll be
using the iPad to control my AR Drone
and he'll be using the Samsung Galaxy
Tab 10.1 to control his AR Drone we're
basically gonna take them off hover them
up in the air and then fly them as fast
as we can towards each other hoping that
based like collide and then we're gonna
see which one stays in the air or
doesn't or gets damaged the least and
that will be the winner so yeah if you
were looking for a phenomenally
expensive hobby that has absolutely no
purpose whatsoever this AR Drone
jousting is for you all you need is two
AR drones two tablets
and an inordinate amount of spare time
so I'm gonna stand over here no I'm not
gonna stand there I'm gonna stand I'll
stand here and let's take them off
so reboot the default height ready and
go
all their necks okay okay run around
bring it down along the path
bring it down nice and low and then
bring yours over here
okay turn it around so that it faces me
and slick is a crappy pilot okay ready
bring it up a little higher all right
well iPad wins round one okay round two
and go
oh just met
here we go again
all right let's see who is the big
winner someone lost a camera and their
hull and that would have been me I
wonder if she still flies um I think
Androids the winner for this one folks
thanks for watching and don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
well we don't do too much like this but
there you go
so slicked Android powered drone is
still a perfectly capable of flight 100%
intact everything is a-okay ha the iOS
powered drone has been through a lot the
lens snapped right off the camera
although it's possible that I'll be able
to glue this back on and it'll just work
as long as I get the positioning just
right the hull came off and seems to
have lost some of its structural
integrity that split wasn't there before
so now it's pretty split apart and I
think the big winner today is slick with
his Android powered AR Drone and now now
we're actually done there we go I hope I
can repair this what a stupid hobby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
