reasons from accessing region blocked
content to logging into your school's
library from off campus to obfuscating
your IP address when you're legally
downloading backups of your movies and
games but did you know that a VPN can be
used to potentially save thousands of
dollars on your next airplane ticket we
are gonna show you guys how in just a
few seconds you can completely stymie
the airline's algorithms and get the
best possible price for your next trip
oh and by the way it works for hotel and
car rentals too now full disclosure this
works with just about any VPN of your
choosing but we will be using private
Internet access VPN one of our sponsors
here on the show so if you like what you
see you can check them out at the link
in the video description
to demonstrate how Airlines and flight
booking services showed different search
results depending on who you are and
where you're from
we're gonna do a test where we book a
flight from London to Denver and see if
we get different prices so the first
thing we're gonna do is a regular old
search as if we live in London so if I
type show my location into Google it's
telling me I'm in London now if I go to
the Expedia UK site and book a flight
from lhr to dn for September 11th to
15th and choose business class the
cheapest result I get is a direct flight
from Iberia Airlines for five thousand
nine hundred and thirty five pounds
that's over seventy five hundred US
dollars
pretty steep okay so now let's see if we
can get a better price the first thing
that you need to do is clear the cookies
from your browser
remember that cookies are messages that
web servers pass to your browser as you
surf the internet creating a record of
your activity online travel sites use
cookies to help them drive ticket sales
so if you search for a flight but then
you leave without buying the cookies
will tell them that and then the next
time you search for that flight they
might increase the price that you see by
maybe a small amount ten twenty dollars
at that point human psychology compels
you to buy the ticket right now out of
fear that the price will continue to go
up fortunately you can get browser
extensions that help you delete cookies
as you go we're using auto cookie delete
which clears all the cookies generated
by a tab as soon as you close it or it
can dump them automatically as you
browse cool next we're gonna use our VPN
to make it look like we're browsing from
somewhere else now there are differing
theories as to what the best location to
book flights from is I've heard that
booking from the US always gets the best
deal I've heard that booking from a less
affluent place like the Midwest instead
of the coast or a less affluent country
like India instead of Germany is the way
to go and then there are those who swear
that booking from the destination
country is the best or even that it's
the local currency of the airline itself
that matters naturally the only way to
test these theories is to run your own
experiments and this is where your
choice of VPN makes a difference because
you want a VPN that has servers in lots
of different locations all around the
world so you can see that p IA has a
decently long list here including some
countries with multiple servers within
them so since we're flying from London
to Denver I'm gonna choose the Denver
server so now I'm going back to my
browser making sure my cookies are
cleared and now when I tell Google to
show me my location you can see that it
thinks I'm in Denver
going back to Expedia and searching for
the same flight again BAM there's that
same nonstop flight from Iberia Airlines
this time for 49 16 US dollars instead
of 7700 a full $2,800 cheaper that is
all there is to it
if you travel a lot obviously the
savings can end up adding up pretty
quickly for us booking from the
destination definitely looks like a
winning strategy but let us know in the
comments below after you've tried it if
you've had success with some other way
regardless of all of that having a good
VPN is definitely worth it especially
considering that this is only one of the
many things that a VPN can be used for
and they're cheap pi/8 can be had for as
little as $2.99 a month so be sure to
check them out at the link below you
only have to save two thousand dollars
on a flight like once to pay for an
entire lifetime of PIAA so guys let us
know if you dislike this video you can
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description also down there is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join and leave a comment
if you want to see more
about the uses of VPNs just to like this
one we could make this into like series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
