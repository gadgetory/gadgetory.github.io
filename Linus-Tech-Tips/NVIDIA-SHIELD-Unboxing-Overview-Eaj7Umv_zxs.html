learn more to give you guys some idea
how excited I am to be having a look at
the Nvidia shield number one is I built
myself a ghetto shield which you can
check out and number two is this that is
how excited I am about Nvidia shield I
know
Nvidia is getting a lot of flack about
this product from the enthusiasts saying
if I wanted to play those games I play
them on my PC or saying if I wanted to
play those other games I'd play them on
my smart phone or saying it's too
expensive or saying whatever whatever
and whatever else personally I am
extremely excited about it for a number
of reasons number one is this is the
first consumer grade device that
features a Tegra 4 processor so Tegra 4
might not necessarily be all about the
CPU aspect of the performance but it is
all about GPU and early benchmarks of
shields seem to be indicating that
compared particularly to the GPUs you
can get in most modern smartphones these
days even things like the Samsung Galaxy
s4 it is very very powerful so it's a
capable little gaming platform and
number two is the fact that it enables
not only the ability to play Android
devices ARP 2 and Android devices to
play Android games on a dedicated device
but also your PC games and last but not
least with what I'd consider to be a
console grade controller now I've had my
hands on shield before back when we did
an episode of net linked weekly so I
already know what the fit and finish is
like and guys it is absolutely fantastic
so included with the box you get the
shield device itself you get the wall
wart which has nvidia z' felt Nvidia
logo on it so there's not really much to
say there and then you also get a
microUSB charging cable
I still hate microUSB I understand why
they're using it but that won't make me
stop hating it you also get a Quick
Start Guide that acts as a product tour
although NVIDIA has some great videos on
their YouTube channel that can walk you
through the whole process of setting it
up it comes with on
back here a mini HDMI out so you can run
it directly to your TV if you wanted to
do that for whatever reason although
personally I'd expect most people to use
it handheld it has micro USB right there
for charging a headphone microphone jack
this is the one ergonomic thing that I
think is a little bit strange about
shield I wouldn't have minded seeing
this perhaps on the bottom of the device
so it's a little bit closer to you and
it's not coming out the back of it and
then finally on the back you have a
microSD slot so shield only has 16 gigs
of memory but you can add up to 64 gigs
with it as micro SDXC in fact we have
one that's a very high performance and
disc one that runs at about 80 megabytes
per second so on super stoked on using
that now the exhaust vent I've seen it
in action like I said before doesn't
interfere with where your fingers sit
which is nice because there is a fair
bit of power in there so it does need
active cooling so that's the only
exhaust vent right there but it exhausts
away from your finger so you've got the
two shoulder buttons right here left and
right as well as to trigger buttons so
those are nice analog buttons with
varying sensitivity levels just like
that also on the back here you've got
what they're calling I think they call
them tags or something like that
whatever whatever branding they have for
them you can basically swap out these
top I think they were calling them
shields at the beginning and that was
part of where the name came from but at
any rate you can get carbon-fiber ones
or whatever it's not the kind of thing
that I would be likely to replace but if
I did want to customise my shield and I
knew someone who happens to be sort of
crafty then I would probably just get
them to like paint this or something
that would be kind of a neat way to
customize your shield without actually
spending more money on it the bottom of
the device has a very nice rubberized
grip hopefully that's not going to come
off over time it doesn't really feel
like it's like it's got any come off
this to it so feels very very good the
one thing about the feeling of shield
that sort of put me off a little bit at
first particularly I'm going to have to
let you guys know once I spend more time
with it this is a device that I'll be
taking home and I will be using and I
will be doing a more extensive follow-up
on letting you guys know exactly what I
think of Nvidia shield but the one thing
that puts me off a little bit about it
is the weight it's quite heavy compared
to
like a smartphone or other Android
device compared to what you might be
used to however with that weight comes
solidity so you can see when I shake it
around that hinge doesn't move the hinge
is strong a crappy hinge can take what
otherwise might be a beautiful ID or a
really nice device and turn it into
something that is annoying and then
finally useless when the thing actually
breaks so I'm glad to see that they've
invested in making the hinge correct I
also know speaking of investing in
making things correctly that they've
gone through a ton of revisions on this
game pad since CES which was the first
time I was hands-on with shield so it's
got an eight-way d-pad up here on the
left it's got two analog joysticks right
here that field there actually that's
quite nice I've got a bit quite a linear
feel to them okay yeah excited about
that
Android navigation buttons here so home
back the custom Nvidia button which
loads up the Nvidia interface that takes
you to like Tiger Zone and you can play
android games from there or you can buy
android games or you can fire up the PC
streaming so PC streaming requires a few
different things number one is you need
a shield number two is you need the
latest drivers and GeForce experience
for your desktop number three is you
need to kepler GPU so that's Nvidia 600
series 650 Ti and up I believe don't
maybe don't quote me on that on but
honestly I'd recommend anything from
sort of a six sixty and up if you want
to have a great experience whether it's
on the desktop or below 650 TI boost
actually isn't that easy though okay
anyway you need a game that you need the
latest beta version of Steam so you have
to enable beta builds and Steam and then
you should pretty much be ready to go
you just have to make sure you've
launched the game at least once and then
you have to have the shield running on
the same Wi-Fi network as the network
that your PC is attached to
contrary to Nvidia setup video where
they show both the PC and shield
connected via Wi-Fi you don't have to
have them both on Wi-Fi they just have
to be connected through the same router
so you press the Nvidia button in the
middle to fire it up you can see they
have a helpful instruction thing here on
the cover the one thing that bothers me
and other people that I've seen already
a little bit about shield is that the 5
inch 720p display multi-touch bubbled on
giving you
as suspects in the unboxing like I
usually do has a very large frame around
it I kind of wish that they'd gone with
something more like maybe a five and a
half inch and they'd reduced the the
bezel space a little bit because having
a big bezel around a monitor really does
make it look smaller than it is 720p and
5-inch isn't that small compared to what
we're used to on our phones in fact it's
quite large but I think what happens is
you're used to here's what happens
here's why it feels small so besides the
larger bezel people hold their phones
like this so there's no interface here
so you hold your phone you like this you
sit this far away from it with a shield
you're going to hold it in a similar
position but look how much farther the
screen is from your face so that's why
the five-inch screen ends up feeling a
little bit on the smaller side it's also
because of the bulkiness of the device
itself this contrasts sharply with
something like the SteelSeries free
which is their little Bluetooth
controller that you compare to your
phone and didn't end up being a very
successful product but with the shield
and videos gone we'll know we're not
going to make it small we're going to
make it ergonomic and everything else
sort of well so much so much for that
there's a couple tuned speakers here
actually I never did finish the the
guided tour there's a microphone port
right there and then ABXY buttons so you
can actually use not only the
touchscreen up here for interfacing with
the shield but also the button so I'm
going to walk you through that in a
moment once I go through the startup
process so as you guys can see the
screen is quite glossy so if you prefer
matte screens this is not one but we've
we've come to expect that from
touchscreens there's also a quick
getting started guide so it shows you
the Nvidia button as well as walking you
through the navigation buttons and well
okay so the ABXY buttons showing you the
functionality that they mostly have so a
is usually confirmed B is usually back
and then finally AHA yes you can
actually use the right joystick check
that out as a virtual mouse pointer for
precision movements and this is the kind
of thing I may end up actually using a
fair bit so that's that's that's
actually pretty cool and then you can
actually click just by pressing that
down I don't know if it's going to allow
me to click on continue here look look
it's kind of awkward too yeah there we
go that network not bad or press y2p
there
so I'm just going to set up my right
here so if you've ever set up an Android
device before you'll have probably seen
all the stuff that I just did because
this is a completely stock Android
device in fact one of the things that
Nvidia is committed to on their webpage
for shield is timely upgrades to the
latest Android operating systems so
they've only really made a couple small
changes to it and that is well pretty
much this so pressing the Nvidia button
gives you shield games that you have
installed the shield store PC games so
you can navigate in all the ways that
you're used to so you can go touchscreen
okay you can use the d-pad just like
that you can use the left analog stick
okay especially if you're not clumsy
about it and finally you can use the
shoulder buttons to navigate through the
different menus so you have almost so
many options that my mother would find
it confusing but it's okay I'm not my
mother so I think I can handle that it
comes preloaded with a couple of shield
games so we're going to go ahead and go
up shield game so we have real boxing
Riptide gp2 beach buggy blitz sonic for
episode 2 and so these are this
particularly as a Tegra HD game you can
tell from the little logo in the top and
if you want to shop for more than you
can check out the shield store there so
they have everything from free games to
paid games and you can of course use the
regular Google Play Store as well it
also comes pre-loaded with a couple of
other applications including twitch TV
if you're a gamer who's got something
like a shield there's a good chance you
watch game streams on Twitch or maybe
the line of tech tips when show on
Twitch that's another option as well and
I just want to cover a couple of other
hardware specs before I give you guys
sort of the follow-up so actually no
I'll tell you what we're going to follow
up at first we're going to be doing
ghetto shield versus our actual shield
in terms of latency comparison so guys
stay tuned for that that's going to be
really exciting remember that shield has
a very excellent wireless implementation
so it's Wireless end but it's MIMO so
that is pretty much an effective
doubling of the available bandwidth and
also because it uses the 5 gigahertz
band it is able to potentially reduce
interference with random household
devices so there's that there's also the
fact that it uses the built-in h.264
encoding on Kepler in order to reduce
the file sizes of the images that are
being beamed to it when you're using the
beta right now it's beta game streaming
from your
top so we want to compare latency as
well as image quality to our ghetto
shield that we built using an HTC One
and an Xbox 360 controller it does have
GPS built in it has two gigs of RAM and
I think that's pretty much it for the
stuff that I had forgotten so far and
then the second follow up will be more
of a long-term review I don't do many
reviews but this is something that I'm
going to spend probably a good month
with and give you guys some idea once I
have it
how much do I actually use the bloody
thing because I have an Android phone I
have a PC so what am I going to use this
for I don't know maybe that'll give you
guys some idea if it's something that
you'll use as well but I find the form
factor very comfortable shield has
outstanding battery life better than
pretty much any phone so it's great for
watching things like movies in theory
which I haven't done yet it's also more
ergonomic to hold than something like a
tablet necessarily when you're carrying
it around with you you know down like
that there's your movie
whereas tablets you have to carry them
around with what are often very awkward
so you like look at this this is sort of
what I'd consider to be like a typical
tablet case this is an Iconia w7 and you
kind of like prop it up on this thing
but I never quite trust them whereas
something like a shield makes a lot of
sense to me but of course it has a
smaller screen than most tablets at any
rate guys that's it for the shield
