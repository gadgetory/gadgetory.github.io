that's closed exactly like this this
arrived for us Oh Matt almost two weeks
ago I think but we've been so busy in
the rush leading up to taking a week off
for the holiday and with a bunch of like
really time-sensitive projects that even
though this has been sitting there
taunting me I haven't had a chance to
even look at it
so what's inside this crate is to my
knowledge the first sample that digital
storm has sent out of their new flagship
a vente mechs gaming PC and it does
appear as though the live stream is
working so I was just I was just
checking that real quick to make sure
that that was working and this is really
bizarre because it's working on YouTube
throwing floatplane but doesn't seem to
be working on floatplane add Kenya send
Luke a quick text message or give him a
quick call see if we can sort that out I
don't know how that works
David you can close that door if you
don't want to listen to me thank you
David so anyway here come on
have a have a look at this so I've seen
a lot of crates in my day opened a lot
of crates in my day but this one's
really weird so we got the nail gun okay
nail gun we've seen before we've got the
staples staples we've seen before up
here we've got more staples but these
clips these clips are actually something
that I'm not familiar with so it appears
as though they just pop off like this
this may be a very unspectacular
uncrating here which is a shame because
I had like all my tools ready and
everything had my framing hammer my
drill corded because you know we don't
take chances when it comes to live
productions you know that's why all of
our live productions go so smoothly
without any issue
and I've got my what would Gordon do
crowbar you know I was actually so
pissed the first time I figured out that
someone had used this as an actual
crowbar because I don't know if you guys
remember this but back when nvidia
launched like i don't know the 580 or
something i was like a thousand years
ago 680 it's got an nvidia shield on it
so it must be kepler but back when they
launched it this was like a swag random
swag item that they sent out and it used
to be in great shape but you know i
actually like it better this way
like battle-worn you know let's go ahead
in make sure you tell them that the
YouTube stream and twitch streams are
both working so like tell them don't
just unplug the server because we are
streaming alright let's open this baby
so specs wise you can pretty much guess
what's in here it is everything to the
max I think this is something like
$7,000 u.s. or nine thousand eight
thousand I don't know it's somewhere in
the neighborhood of like closer to ten
thousands than it is to five thousand
gaming system and by the time you are
looking at a gaming system that costs
that much it's hardly even really a
gaming system anymore it's just an
everything system like what can't it do
oh well that's not what I was expecting
I mean I don't know what I was expecting
but they sent all this crate but then
the box itself is actually like pretty
reasonable it's just a normal digital
storm box
I guess the crate was more just out of
concern for it arriving in one piece
which I can relate to we actually just
got back one of our oh my god this is
heavy how the hell am I gonna get it out
of here
so we just got back one of our og rig
reboot systems that we had sent to the
winner and that thing is bad actually
you know what Edie can you fire Ivan a
message tell them to bring that 20 atti
down here man we have some we have some
tech Gor for you guys it just got
absolutely savaged during shipping it's
like tragic to look at actually to say
that it was dropped would be an
understatement really really
disappointing I mean the winner is also
disappointing because it means they
don't have their system yet we got to
file a claim bla bla bla bla bla bla
really really sucks crappy situation all
around but basically what happened was
the the the graphic the RAM came loose
and like banged around inside it and
then the Soha leading us back to our
secret shopper talking about how common
it is for RAM to come loose and shipping
there you go literally just happened to
us except instead of just coming loose a
little bit it came out there's like
dents like it looks like someone shot
the back of the video card with a BB gun
and then the graphics card ripped out of
the slot so the PCI Express connector is
pretty mangled
oh my god what the hell how is a system
that's heavy
what yeah no no I got this don't worry
it's fine come on I just need it on the
tipping point ah there we go
wow it's so bottom heavy like look at
this look how far I had it tipped over
that is still gonna go backwards
that's how heavy this system is I don't
think I've ever seen anything like it
okay
let's see if we can get it out now come
on okay maybe if we can kind of walk it
a little get it free of that piece of
foam on the bottom that's why the crates
so big so you can you can get in there
with your system because you'll be so
excited to have it you'll just want to
like you know snuggle it I don't know
just making stuff up I'm just stalling
for time at this point longtime viewers
will be familiar with this strategy of
mine just because that used to be half
of the video back when the channel was
mostly unboxings was me babbling while I
figure out how to open packaging this is
all complicated it's all different you
know and so have you like I can't get to
slide it really just have to keep okay
one second
watch my turn oh my my toes are fine
thank you I got it just come on Steve
some leverage just gonna leave her it up
just get in there nope it's so heavy
okay so if you order one of these I
recommend having your Butler help you
open it because let's face it if you
order one of these you probably have a
butler oh holy crap like Brendan can you
get a sense watching me move this thing
around for how heavy it is I wish I had
a scale or something quantify this now I
brought this table over here to put it
on but I think we might have a problem
ah I might need a different table oh
there it is okay yeah sorry I hear Ivan
you want to throw this on here this is
just this is just sad he brought the
whole system down so a couple things
check this out that is the battery
holder for the motherboard how we came
to be in possession of the battery
holder for the motherboard well that's a
tale that's not for the weak of heart so
first of all we found the RAM here and I
even got a little confused cuz he was
like dude we just put like an extra heat
spreader there as a decoration no sirs
and Madam's we did not do such a thing
it came out of the slot and ended up
there so check this out do we know what
caused that is that the RAM bouncing
around graphics card that's a bummer
okay hold on hold on don't don't skip to
the finale yet check this out this PCI
Express slot is coming down at an angle
here and you can see the bottom part of
it has actually been sheared off see
that through these little pieces coming
free here
we have some like abrasion marks here on
the chipset heatsink yeah I mean none of
this really looks that bad this this is
where things get really ugly
so people people have often asked me why
I'll talk about like why I whine
I used to whine and harp on the packing
materials in case boxes back in the day
when I'd unbox them and it's because
system integrators build systems in them
then they use those boxes to ship the
completed system and if your box isn't
over built if it's designed only for the
case this is what happens this is how
you get dead graphics cards no digital
storm they're going a little over the
top here but that's not necessarily a
bad thing but come in come have a look
at this so the top of the PCI bracket
here you can see has been bent but not
nearly as bad as the bottom so this has
been so far that the graphics card was
able to rip free from the slot and it
pulled the threading out of these thumb
screws because that's how heavy these
r-tx cards are and this this is where
we're really running into trouble this
is where this card goes from maybe we
could still get it to work just replace
the PCI bracket - this card is never
going to retrace anything again you can
see that the contact fingers along the
PCI Express slot here two of them here
on the power section have been shared
clean off or not quite clean off one of
them is completely off the other ones
almost off and the other side is not
nearly as bad but if you look down the
card you should be able to see that this
backplate can you can you see write down
the card this backplate is bent and this
slot air that excuse me this these
fingers this tab goes over this way
so this is one dead as a doornail RTX
2080 ti I can't promise you won't get
banned for it because of the spam
spam protection bots that we have but I
wouldn't blame you for pressing F
because that thing is done yeah it's
okay we don't have to oh right yeah
there's one more thing that happens so
we're gonna make the argument that this
was mistreated by the courier because
how exactly is it that through this much
spacing you would get a dent on the back
of the case like that
probably complete and utter carelessness
so yeah thanks Ivan I'm sorry to be a
total downer on our first string after
the break here you guys but you know
just wanted to share that share that sad
story with y'all
it looks like is floatplane streaming
working now yeah it looks like it's
working right it do we know what the
issue was no okay so it just started
working a loop got it working okay cool
all right oh now let's have a look now
that's another thing that I always worry
about when we do these lives unboxings
is I don't know that this actually
arrives safely like if you talk to you
talk to the BS mods guys for example
we've worked with them a fair bit and
there's a reason that they actually
hand-deliver their mods to almost every
trade show and every one that I'm aware
of now that I think of it PDX CES they
just they just drive their systems there
because even packed in a crate when
you've got a really heavy system that's
a little bit fragile cuz like it's
modded it's not you know out-of-the-box
that way when you've got a really heavy
system that can happen even a small bump
is a lot of inertia or like a lot of
momentum that you have to stop I mean I
guess inertia and momentum they're sort
of related
it doesn't matter look scientists
watching this do I look like a scientist
to you look at this Footwear alright oh
my god this tape it's like double layers
of like the heaviest packing tape I've
ever seen
but I'm not gonna harp on them for
overpacking it like I said it's just
kind of a pain in the ass for me right
and stuff there we go laughs all right
so first things first it looks like they
actually went for the sort of reasonable
option for the power supply the ax 1200
eye now it's still a 1200 watt ax
iSeries Corsair power supply which means
it's all digital and blah blah
titanium efficiency or whatever is it
there's a titanium the 1200 III I don't
know it doesn't really matter but it's
not the 1600 I like the flagship one
because that actually is unnecessary for
basically any system we've got our RGB
controller remote I'm gonna hold on to
that for later we've got our copy of
Microsoft Windows 10 Pro gone full Pro
on our windows here we've got our
accessories including a power cord so
yeah this is just all the random
accessories for arm Maximus 11 oh that's
weird
oh that's really weird I had thought
interesting I had thought that they were
sending over 79 80 or 90 980 XE
configuration but they've actually gone
pure gamer on this one rather than
trying to make it sort of a do all that
ends up giving up some gaming
performance in order to get better
workstation performance by throwing a
bunch of you know cores that you don't
need for gaming in it fascinating okay
so we've got it on to this side up but
there is now no way to remove the system
other than to turn it the side down
so we're gonna do that now a big part of
the weight of this thing is the cooling
I've actually seen a prototype of this
before but not in a video or at least
not one that went up on our channel and
I didn't really get long to spend with
it because it was part of like an Intel
contest or something okay even the box
is heavy let's have a look at this thing
this is like a really really heavy box
like it's got a lot of strength to it
okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry the
box fetish can wait all right nice thick
foam although I can see why they created
this because even with this really heavy
closed cell foam I could see this thing
stopping too suddenly and shaking
something loose I sincerely hope that
didn't happen I'm sure I'm sure if any
of the digital storm guys are watching
right now they're like oh so interesting
it looks like they've done one of their
trademark come on in here Brendan one of
their trademark automotive grade paint
finishes and they have done so far one
hell of a job of it that is like that is
basically perfect look at that
not bad now not cheap but not bad that's
okay I mean you know you when you have
something this expensive you want to
make sure that you take care of it okay
so I want you to get your Butler to go
ahead and you know buffing every once in
a while okay
his Butler the PC term where is that out
kind of like secretary assistant PA I
think they're called pas now right
personal assistants assistant okay so
Butler Butler is out that's an archaic
term okay wow it's like monolithic what
the hell am I gonna do with it now
okay uh Edie we actually have a problem
I don't have anywhere to put do you
think I can put it on this table maybe
maybe if we go real smooth hold on hold
on
I mean think about it this way one way
or another we're giving the people what
they want they either want to see the
system or they want to see it drop so
there's no bad result really okay okay
I actually am not sure if I can lift
this myself it give me a sec I kind of
injured my knee about a month ago
playing badminton oh my god that's heavy
no I need help
Nick fast Nick's here it's fine take an
end no no just just an end just an it
Justin I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm
just not completely good we're putting
it on that table that you just holy
how the hell could assistant be that
heavy I was kind of hoping like some of
it was the box and stuff how we're live
right now by the way Nick
really okay cool um oh my god
okay it's just all dark like we can't we
can't even really see anything um okay
just sec I'm gonna kind of twist it over
here so we can do one side at a time
it's easier to lift the table than it is
to move the system just gonna make sure
there's no strain on the legs here
anything like that so uh I accidentally
ended up with us looking at the backside
what do the people in chat wan do you
guys want me to pop the panels and give
you a look at it first or do you want me
to fire it up and illuminate it and then
we'll look at it that way guys let me
know in the chat in the meantime I'm
gonna start undoing these screws in case
that's what you'd like to see holy crap
like the amount of cooling in this thing
that is where we are running into our
you know a little too much Christmas
dinner weight gain problem we got over
here I mean that needs gigantic pieces
of tempered glass are not helping things
so I'm gonna hold that on with my head
now that's using your noggin
hey I'm sorry okay what do they want
what do the people want dad you gotta
help me out you're in the control-room
bed pop the battle's I mean you guys are
gonna want me to pop the towels
oh look at him
now some people appreciate the
simplicity of a Mac I appreciate having
features and cooling to each thrown
right okay so what we've got back here
is some ridiculous stuff so things that
would normally be cooled like down here
we've got a dual 140 millimeter radiator
with a couple of digital storms these
look
like Corsairs they've got to be Corsair
fans that they've like gonna put their
own badging on hold on I'm just gonna
use my phone as a mirror and see if the
hub has a Corsair logo or they oh it's
got of course certainly oddities well no
no of course their link works with any
fan yeah I just want to get a look at it
if I can it's really hard though the
angle is not conducive to Dixie not
compressing the pixie button traction
you know you got to know when you're not
wanted Bixby it's not a good time okay
yeah I can't I can't see it right now
but they look like Coursera rebrands
that they've just put their own sticker
on which is not a bad thing so that's
normal what's not normal is that we've
got this cooling fan that remember is
almost right up against the last panel
so it's kind of just recirculating air
cooling I mean he'll I don't know this
Corsair link controller module and then
we've got this one that is actually
dedicated can you see it's ready to come
get an angle at this on this that's
actually dedicated to the back of the
CPU where it mounts to the motherboard
because some motherboards actually do
have heatsink serve erm components back
there and normally they wouldn't get any
cooling other than what they get through
the copper material that the motherboard
is made of conducting heat away from
them to somewhere where there is a fan
or there is a heatsink
so they've got a fan that just blows
down on that that's it that's all it
does that's all this fan exists to do a
140 millimeter cooling fan
alright then they've got some other
really cool stuff here in this hall I
could already tell this one's got it
whoa that was close
I'm gonna move this I bumped it when I
was it's a cat aquatics right so this
has got an RGB strip down it and this is
one of the coolest things that I have
ever seen done so we showed off the
specter Specter case that you could get
with a similar kind of design but this
is that
on steroids so this is a water
distribution panel that will be
illuminated from the side that basically
brings water from up here wherever that
goes they've got this fascia piece
that's making it kind of hard for me to
see so they've got a water distribution
a block here that takes it from the top
to the bottom of the system and then
comes out wherever they need cooling
throughout the rest of the system really
cool stuff they've also got this like
power distribution PCB that they've
created this is their own custom PCB up
here that I'm not sure exactly what it
does but we're gonna go ahead and pop
this panel back on them we're gonna how
many people are watching 57,000 is that
a record I might be that might be a
record oh we should probably cover our
sponsor who's the first one memory
Express what are my talking points is it
about their new store in Victoria or
their uber price Pete guarantee that
allows them to beat authorized Canadian
retail prices both online and in-store
by ten percent of the difference go
checkout memory Express at the link in
the video description not now not now we
can we can do that later for now I
really want to get this thing flipped
around and I really need to focus on
doing it safely because I don't want to
ruin this thing so this is not going to
be the full review of this system it's
just that this has been sitting here
kind of staring me in the face and it's
been in this epic crate and I really
wanted to open it on camera
and we haven't had a good opportunity so
I figured we'll do a stream and then we
will spend some real quality time with
this thing evaluating whether the 48
pounds of cooling or whatever it is they
have in this thing is actually worth
while or whether it is pure pure status
symbol I mean at this point why not both
right
so we'll see how that goes sorry guys
it's just it's taking me a little while
to turn it around I just need to be
really careful this thing is probably
almost or as heavy as the mineral oil
cooled machine bare to give you guys
some freaking idea like it weighs almost
the same as that I swear it
you unreal okay am i turned around
enough you got a good angle you got
light alright so now we get to see the
goodies it's fun it's a it's not just
any system that that I can get sort of
feeling anticipation for these days has
seen a lot of gaming systems at this
point but the ones that combine being a
gaming system with craftsmanship or art
like the retro one that Intel had done
up those are the ones that are really
exciting for me so here we are this is
how their water distribution panel works
so what it does is instead of running
all the tubing bends sort of up through
the system obstructing the view of the
reservoir or the cards or whatever else
we've gone with this approach that
allows them to have these straight runs
that go down to exactly where they're
needed so we've got our labeled but our
Inlet and outlet one or the other
for our CPU then we've got and can't
tell doesn't seem to matter once I flick
it on we'll be able to tell but we've
got our Inlet and outlet for our
graphics cards so these are plumbed up
in serial so it's going to go into one
then it's gonna go through that block
over to the other through this channel
that is machined out of this solid block
of acrylic here oh that's gorgeous it's
completely clear look at this come come
come come look at this they've done such
a magnificent job of bringing this out
and polishing the insides of it this is
an ek water block distribution block
here so it goes all the way over to the
other card through that and then out the
other side and then this this is what
they're using their panel for so it's
actually a pastor Brennan you're gonna
have to get low here this is going to be
a little bit challenging for you but can
you see up there so that that panel is
just passing through the cables from the
back to the front and
they're using their own custom
individually sleeved and combed modular
cables in order to access the graphics
cards here huh now in terms of the spec
like I said they actually haven't gone
that crazy so these are 28 et eyes like
I'm not saying this is a low-end machine
this is as fast as it gets sort of you
know if you want to spend a while I mean
okay you can afford one of these maybe
you do go RTX titans I don't know anyway
they're not it's not quite but when they
built it it definitely was but then
they've gone presumably 9900 Kay and
then they've actually gone for 3,000
megahertz 32 gigs of just g.skill
trident ii RGB like tried tried tested
and true RGB memory that's it that's all
like no you know 128 gigs of ram or
anything stupid like that
alright now cooling I soldier I was
going to talk about the cooling system
so we had that dual 140 millimeter rad
on the back in the top we have what
appears to be a 1/2 you've got to be
kidding me
how many is this I love this oh come
over here okay oh this is gonna be
really hard to see Brandon I'm sorry you
got to get down you get to get down get
low get low get low check this out that
is how that radiator is plumbed they've
got another one of their distribution
blocks for it here so that's the end and
there are that's the the butt end and
then this is the tubing end so it comes
out into this and then goes out the back
into that back flat water backplane
there that is unreal so that's a triple
140 we are now up to five 144 millimetre
rads worth of cooling capacity and it
gets better my friends because down here
in a design that actually really reminds
me of my old TJ o7 down here they've got
a quad 140 millimeter radiator and these
are like these aren't but that's really
this is a really funny design decision
instead of going with the loose Finn
arrangement that is more optimized for
slowly running fans and
okay temperatures they've got a tight
thin arrangement that is more optimized
for faster rpm fans and just extremely
low temps they've gone with a d5 pump
and res combo down here so that's
running there they haven't gone with any
fancy pantsy like coolant tolerance or
anything like that those are stupid
anyway
they eventually gunk up always so you
just kind of shouldn't use them water is
the way to go in terms of boot drive I
can't see what they've put in but they
tip throw in a mechanical hard drive up
here I don't know what that is doesn't
really matter point is let's find out
how much RGB this sucker has shall we
what do you guys think let's do it ah
oh wow okay no I got one more thing to
show you Brendan I don't know how well
you're gonna be able to see this I'm
counting on your excellent camerawork
here but can you tell that basically the
entire back of this thing is mesh mesh
for the power supply mesh for the back
of these radiators that are blowing in
towards each other as far as I can tell
so it's just gonna be passively
exhausting out the back mesh here mesh
here mesh up here it's all mesh it's all
mesh it's gorgeous so all the cooling
actually happens at the back because the
front as you guys might recall is just
that automotive finish and then both
sides are tempered glass you know what
I'm gonna fire it up with this side off
so we can see it full brightness because
these are actually kind of like a crap
what's it called not God not tinted but
like a not darkened smoked these are a
smoked cut style of glass so yes tinting
would be sort of an accurate word buts
smoky is what the appearance looks like
so what that does is it kind of it dulls
the RGB glare a little bit but still
obviously gives you the personalization
that you clearly desire because you've
got RGB stuff I'm having fun I cut
myself that's okay you can never deny
that sweat blood and tears have gone
into this channel now we're not actually
gonna do any benchmarks or anything
today that is not the objective of this
stream we're gonna save all of that for
the full review
but I do want to just see it now is
there RGB built into the blocks that is
something that I do want to know and I
do think there is Oh hilarious check
this out so the cable management for it
is actually quite tidy but they've
pulled right off of this RGB header up
here on the top of the board and then
they've pulled off of a separate one for
the from the bottom of the board and
each of these blocks is individually RGB
with all along I believe it's the vac
here or it could also be the bottom it
doesn't doesn't it doesn't it looks fair
enough it's fair enough ah where's the
button ready but no it's okay it's fine
it's an Asus double post thing they
always do that okay or a triple post
thing come on baby there you go
you got to get all that RGB initiated
look at these cards it's not something
else or what oh man it's like having a
neon sign in your graphics card slides I
think of beauty if you're into that sort
of thing oh man I love it
so where's where'd I put the remote and
I think I stashed I stash the RGB remote
somewhere so I'm not even sure which
lights this remote controls because it
won't be the ones to the motherboard
that's all gonna be controlled by asus
Azara sync application so that will
control the RAM and the graphics cards
and then the fans I guess that would be
through Corsair link I don't know oh
okay
and then so you've actually got like a
multi zone kind of effect here so you've
got holy crap no I lied the front of the
case does have ventilation you've got
another four bloody 140 mm fans in there
are those 140 s or 120 s I can't tell I
think they might be 120 s actually it's
really really hard for me to tell from
here might be 140 s and 120 is it looks
like these three or 140 s and that one's
on 120 or maybe it's offset doesn't
matter the point is one two three four
five
six seven eight nine 10 11 conveniently
they're all lit up for me 12 13 14 15
thing has 15 fans in it not even
counting the power supply fan and the
pump which is arguably a fan they're
very similar in their design okay so
you've got multi zone lighting so you
can control your video cards which I
love the way they put that directly up
to the RGB ports on the motherboard you
can control your ram through the AC
software you can control your course our
fans through their link software then
you've got your like sort of your back
your base mode lighting so you got your
green your red your blue I like it in
green I think that's looking straight
Christmassy I mean seasons kind of over
but you know whatever it doesn't matter
let's go ahead and throw the other spoke
panel on because I've already seen a
peek at the back and that looks really
really good how hard is this to capture
Brandon it's really shiny it's okay now
that is a machine for someone with their
own Butler sorry excuse me personal
assistant thank you we always try to be
very PC here at Lynas tech tips get it
oh you think that's my new year's
resolution that is the last new year's
resolution I am resolving to tell more
dad jokes in 2019 all right so this
gives us a nice look at our our smokey
our smokey color scheme here our smoky
panel you got to come have a look at the
back though because that that water
distribution panel that I was telling
you was gonna look really good
spoiler alert it looks better than I
thought so it's all illuminated on this
side and it just catches like maybe I'm
a freak but I just find a certain beauty
in CNC machine
and just all those all those like those
bolt holes and catching the light like
that it just has like an industrial
Beauty to me I absolutely love it and
again so that zone is controlled in the
same as sort of our base case lighting
along with all the digital storm logos
and event to mechs branding and all that
good stuff
Oh people want to see what the lights
off yeah sure I don't know if we want to
go off but maybe I'll dial them down a
little bit I think that ones only on or
off isn't it Brandon the one with the
big ballast okay so we might have to
kill that kill that one and then let's
see what happens as we dial back the
other ones here yeah I'm sorry guys I
didn't even think of that before we
started how's your lighting Brandon okay
we can call that good so I am really
excited to see what kind of numbers this
thing can pump Oh what kind of cooling I
mean this water should be damn near
ambient temperature like no matter how
much heat you throw at what is it six
plus three nine by 140 millimeters worth
of radiators I mean that's why this
thing is so heavy it's full of water but
that's why it weighs as much as an
immersion cooled system they're both
full of I mean that's mineral oil this
is water but you get the point change it
to red oh sorry guys there we go how's
that you like that better you like it
yeah I'll show you all the colors but
you know I'm not partial to the blue not
that big on the blue although it kind of
works with the the yellow scheme that
they've apparently pre-programmed no no
these are cycling we could just go like
full rainbow mode oh wow no it really
does it has a it has a unicorn bar
setting they're individually addressable
Wow well let's turn up the speed then
why not go full dance party
oh that is hard to look at it's like
taking the Mona Lisa and like well
putting RGB on there's really nothing
you can't make tacky with individually
addressable RGB strips right oh man oh
well I think that pretty much I think
that pretty much wraps it for our stream
today yeah I should probably talk to
some of my wonderful super chat
contributors contributors over there I
also want to I also want to tell you
about our sponsor for the video today

the constellation wants our lights back

of this design being the top-selling one
