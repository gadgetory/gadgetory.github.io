unboxing to do this is the NZXT Hades
they basically like drop this off at our
office they were like here's a sample do
whatever you want with it so I figured
I'll do what I do best I'll unbox it so
this computer case includes dual 200
millimeter intake fans dual fan control
triple temperature display wire
management and a black interior I love
black interiors now I know nothing about
this case I have done zero research so
I'm going to be discovering everything
about it as we go along so if I say
anything wrong please forgive me make a
comment in the comments and say I don't
know what I'm talking about her
something because the reality of it is I
do not okay so we have nine external
five and a quarter inch bays for
internal three and a half inch hard
drive bays and five external five and a
quarter inch bays away hold on which one
is it okay okay I don't get it seven
expansion slots we have cooling fan
options thanks for that it is included
one two hundred millimeter fan one one
twenty millimeter fan one two hundred
millimeter fan and another 140
millimeter fan is included for the top
dimensions etc etc etc but different
languages scales flip this around and
the latest hardware is supported
including room for 300 or 30 centimeter
cards like the ATI at fifty nine seventy
okay oh I get it here we go here we go
so you can either have nine five and a
quarter inch bays or five five and a
quarter inch bays and four three and a
half inch internal bays cool I get it
control the flow Gaming overclocking or
office work the dual eight watt per
channel fan control allows control over
the dual 200 millimeter fans it's been
up to 150 seats CFM each monitor your
system etc etc etc wire routing
pre-drilled water cooling holes on the
backplate from the others that's also
for office work by the way okay so it's
I mean this computer case is clearly not
for office work no they did not drop it
off
unopened and I haven't opened it since
so it's still technically an unboxing
even though I'm not actually breaking
any seals I know I'm bending the rules
what are you gonna do let's split this
baby open her flip it open flip it over
and get it opened up so this is the
Hades so I think I'm turning it
right-side up right now and then I'm
gonna go ahead and take the styrofoam
ease aw oh that's a pretty small case
actually so this is clearly a mid Tower
it's not a full Tower it's not a
micro-atx shall we fix it
no it's kind of nice looking actually
okay so one thing about NZXT cases that
you will notice right away is that they
are not subtle
they do not take sort of the the
conventional approach when it comes to
the aesthetics so you can see this is a
very sort of forward leaning design it's
very bold it has a front door which is
okay you can look right through it so
that is a mesh front door that's going
to give you the best possible airflow
because that's what this case is clearly
all about is delivering great airflow
once again you can see here at the front
this is all mashin I'm I'm not sure if
there's some kind of a filtration system
there or not that we'll get to that
later okay so here we have our four or
five and a quarter inch base here are
our two fan controls okay so you got a
couple of little nabis there that's kind
of mixed there's your power button in
terms of front panel connectors you've
got your two audio connectors so you got
headphones and microphone you got two
USB and one eSATA here on the top we can
see either two 140 millimeter fans or
two 120 millimeter fans it's nice that
they give you the option for that I
really appreciate that and then on this
side you can see clearly where the 200
millimeter fan is located we got fun
screws included with the case which is
great because I do not have a
screwdriver on me I was not ready to
take a panel off if I didn't if it
didn't have thumb screws all right so
let's just slide that back it's pretty
standard as far as that goes so again
more mesh here at the front so that's
going to be useful for air intake I mean
if you've got lots of graphics card
power going on back here behind the
panel it's going to be great to have
more air coming in this way this is
designed to blow down right on top of
the graphics cards it uses a three pin
fan header so you can plug that into
either their fan controller or a
motherboard head or even great
let's get that panel out of the way okay
pelipper okay okay inside you will find
a user's manual which is black and white
there's nothing particularly exceptional
about this but it does give you some of
the basics in terms of the case it comes
in a few different languages okay so it
shows you how to how to remove the side
panel it shows you how to use some of
the wire management features shows you
how to install drives okay inside here
oh this is kind of neat actually okay
well let's take the other panel off so
that we can have a better look and you
can see this one also has mesh up the
front for more air intake which is great
finish on the case is when we're all
pretty good I mean it's not it's not the
kind of finish that you'd see on
something like a silverstone but it's a
reasonably adequate sort of powder
coating finish you can see there's a
little bit of a cleanness to it so that
will make it a durable and be very
fingerprint resistant something that a
lot of high-end cases actually overlook
and it drives me crazy okay so here
we've got the fan the power connectors
for our top 140 millimeter fan which is
included as well as our rear 120
millimeter fan and they've given you
holes for 92 as well which is pretty
nice okay and you can see these are
connected by three pins but you can also
plug them into this four molex power
alright here they've actually gone ahead
and they've taken the front panel
connectors which is your eSATA your your
power your USB all that stuff and
they've gone and they've routed it
through the cable management holes for
you and put it where it actually needs
to go so in addition to those other
things that you are to the standard
stuff that you have here you have a cup
what appears to be a temperature sensor
for your hard drive you've got a
temperature sensor for your CPU and then
one other just random one for sis okay
you've got a couple more power yeah
these are the power connectors for those
fans you got your front audio you've got
your front USB SATA okay here you will
find all of the accessories that you
will need to mount a system in
Cady's pace alright so let's see what
they've gone and included with this all
right great that's okay I'll just break
it okay I can't even break the tape
that's pretty sad yeah oh wow lots of
cards right here okay so these are drive
bay adapters thank you for that includes
three of those excellent and I believe
they've got one mounted already so
they've shown you how to do it just like
that you've got a whole bunch of thumb
screws for mounting those things there
you go there's a bucket of thumb screws
as well as some hard drive screws okay
and then you've got all of your standard
mounting hardware so these black ones
right here for mounting your optical
drives these silver ones are for
mounting your motherboard they've got
motherboard standoffs which are the
little brass kind okay so that's all
pretty standard and all I love this
they've included a three and a half to
two and a half inch hard drive adapter
so if you have an SSD drive or two maybe
yeah it looks like it might hold two you
can actually mount it in this case by
default and I've got terrible light here
really sorry for that maybe if you move
forward a little bit we'll be able to
see this federal they've included a
bunch of zip ties too for cable
management that's nice okay and then oh
yeah here at the front so here at the
front that's why there's all that mesh
there can you see through that way to
the front tent oh you can't oh that's
great okay so there's the 200 millimeter
fan that's included in the front that's
blowing all through the case and can
come way out the back to all the
included mesh PCI brackets it has a
bottom mounted power supply here are
your water cooling holes it looks like
you can probably use 3/8 inch tubing but
I wouldn't expect to get 1/2 inch tubing
through those holes overall build
quality of the case feels reasonably
good I mean with value gaming cases a
lot of the time you see them cheap out
on the steel or they'll they'll cheap
out on like a support brace here or
something else there I mean really the
standout features in this case are as
follows black interior you've got the
CPU cut out for replacing CPU coolers
with a backplate easily and quickly
you've got these wire management
features I love these things Corsair
kind of did it first with their obsidian
800 D but I love seeing sort of more
value oriented cases coming out that
have this feature because it makes your
wire management look so much
with zero effort you've got to list
melting for your five and a quarter inch
bass okay you just take those out and
then you pop them back in wherever you
want the drive to go and that concludes
my unboxing of the NZXT Hades case</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
