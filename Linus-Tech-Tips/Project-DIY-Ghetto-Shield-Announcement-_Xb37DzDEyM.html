now to learn more so we're here with a
bit of an impromptu video I'm here with
the inventor of the whatever you can be
like Steve Jobs you invented it I just
take credit for someone else's work yeah
pretty much
anyways I saw a demonstration someone
strapped a phone to an Xbox controller
and then was able to wirelessly connect
the Xbox controller to his computer and
use a program called Splashtop to stream
the his monitor to his phone
so he could basically make a ghetto
shield then so here's the here's what we
got going on right here there's some
Counter Strike being played on a
computer downstairs this is being
streamed wirelessly on a galaxy s3 looks
pretty good 800 by 600 right 800 by 600
on the desktop it looks very crisp here
though so what we were thinking is we're
going to take a little bit further than
the demonstration that I saw and we're
going to do a wired version so you can
have your controller plugged directly
into your phone and play Android games
that way a wireless version so you can
have your controller connected
wirelessly to your computer and play
desktop games that way and we were
thinking about throwing a snez
controller in there for some awesomeness
as well so basically by the time we
invest in a couple of Xbox controllers
and an OTG cable and free software you
can basically make a ghetto shield for
under a hundred bucks now able to pull
that down a bit just estimated now it
doesn't have the AI it doesn't have the
battery life benefit of shield doesn't
have necessarily the all-in-one
convenience of shield nope and you're
you have some black bars on the side and
there's the aadhi aadhi yadda yadda
yadda but you're saving a bunch of money
and it's kind of fun it has data and it
has data so we're think eyes we're gonna
we're going to bring you sort of the the
ghetto the ghetto shield sometime in the
next little bit here but we're thinking
something like a cell phone case so that
you can actually snap your your phone
into the piece that thats it's mounted
to the controller so you'd have like two
dedicated controllers a wireless and a
wired one and then your phone which can
just go
as much as you want and we've got a
bunch of plans but we don't know exactly
what's going to work yet but we know
that we can make a wireless and wired
version already so we're going to go
with that for now
wish us luck and as always guys don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and this video is
brought to you from whatever we end up
keying into the background we're out
where are we um in dust yes in dust</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
