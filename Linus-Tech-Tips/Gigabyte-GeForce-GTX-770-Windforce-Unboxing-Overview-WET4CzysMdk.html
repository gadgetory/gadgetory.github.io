Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
Haswell system for unbelievable overall
performance welcome to my unboxing and
first look at the geforce gtx 770
windforce
OC version according to gigabyte here
from gigabyte this is as you may or may
not have figured out by now a geforce
gtx 770 it is overclocked and more
importantly than the factory overclock
it has gigabytes windforce cooler so
there windforce cooler uses a triple fan
design each of these fans being a 75
millimeters in diameter as well as one
of the beefiest come on oh there we go
as well as one of the beefiest heatsink
designs that I have ever seen but I'm
not going to let you feast your eyes on
the card just yet I'm going to make you
look at oh wow
look at them accessories is that to
molex to PCI Express adapters Wow
116 one 8 pin so cool next oh it's not a
driver disc wing and quick graphics card
installation guide although if you don't
like gigabytes installation guide then
you can check out my installation guide
which is a video which is obviously
better because videos are awesome
alright so the cooler itself
there's your 375 millimeter fans all
right there is your massive array of
heatsink fin so check this out you have
a huge block of fins over here on the
left a huge block of fins over here on
the right you can also see from the side
over here there are five heat pipes
coming out this side so two of them are
eight millimeter heat pipes so these are
massive thick heat pipes and then the
other four of the heat pipes that are on
the card itself are six millimeter heat
pipes so you can see which direction
they're all going in actually five of
them go off this way and then one of
them loops around and comes out this
side in order to effectively spread the
heat away from the GPU itself and then
on to the rest of the components now
gigabyte has done a couple of unique
things to improve the efficiency of the
cooler so number one is they have added
this triangle shape is what they're
calling it it's not quite a triangle
because it has a flat top and I hope you
guys can see this so if you check this
out
there's a flattop there and then there
are angled angled pieces that are going
to cause the airflow to be more directed
than you would have normally seen with a
wind force cooler in the past so what
this will do is it'll take the airflow
and it'll bring it in through the fan
and then drive it up this way and down
this way as opposed to causing an
additional turbulence by having it
interfere with the airflow from this fan
which will then be directed this way and
this way this guy over here is kind of
on his own but this serves two purposes
not only to cool the GPU core itself
with all the heat that it's getting from
those heat pipes but also to cool the
vrm components so that is the voltage
delivery our voltage regulation modules
or all of the stuff that turns that
12-volt power that comes in from the PCI
Express connectors into something that a
GPU and memory and all of that can use
now speaking of memory it has a full
memory plate so that is responsible for
cooling the seven gigahertz gddr5 memory
that you'll find on pretty much any
geforce gtx 770 graphics card and
gigabyte has gone with a modest
overclock on the GPU core so it is well
in excess of over one gigahertz however
this is the trick when you have a very
solid cooler on one of these graphics
cards because of GPU boost 2.0 and the
way that it works where it actually
monitors your voltage your temperature
so bear that in mind for later the power
usage as well as the clock speed the
cooler you can keep the card the closer
to within your temperature limit you can
keep it the faster will actually perform
which before GPU boost 2.0 was never
really true so even though one factory
overclocked card might come with clock
speed a and one might come with clock
speed be the one with the better cooler
may actually be running at a higher
clock speed more of the time
particularly if you are in a hot region
now the card is very standard in terms
of its shape and size it is a two slot
card in spite of its 450 watts of heat
dissipation which we saw a demo of at
Computex it is real it is actually a
thing which I thought was pretty darn
cool it's got the standard layout of
ports so you've got two DVI ports as
well as one HDMI and one DisplayPort
port you've also got two fingers for sli
up here giving you
Pat ability with 2-way 3-way and
potentially four-way SLI although NVIDIA
doesn't spend much time talking about
four-way SLI anymore because the reality
of it is it doesn't really scale that
well down at the bottom of the card
we've got a PCI Express 3.0 16 X
connector and then you can see that this
is a completely non reference card so it
uses gigabytes ultra-durable concept
which basically amounts to beefier
components and improved efficiency less
heat output and all that good stuff that
you expect from an aftermarket cooled
card up on the top of the card we've got
the 6 pin PCI Express power adapter as
well as an 8 pin PCI Express power
adapter and a pretty cool sort of
latticework looking shroud that is
attached to the one thing that I'd say
it's kind of non-standard about this
card and that is the wind force branding
up here at the top but as long as you
don't have a very narrow case and
something like a side panel fan that
might interfere with this you're not
going to have too much difficulty now I
wouldn't be completely finishing this
video if I didn't mention some of the
things that it comes with so it has
adaptive vsync which allows you to take
advantage of the benefits of vsync as
well as the benefits of not using vsync
it also has the GeForce experience which
keeps your drivers up-to-date and gives
you suggestions for what settings to run
your games at and later on is going to
be adding shadow play which is pretty
cool it just will use the built-in h.264
encoding on your card in order to record
the last 20 minutes or less or however
much you want of your gameplay so you
can save it for gameplay videos later it
also supports 3d vision as well as
Nvidia surround so that is up to three
displays in surround in one exhilarating
that is pretty much it don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and I hope that you have enjoyed
this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
