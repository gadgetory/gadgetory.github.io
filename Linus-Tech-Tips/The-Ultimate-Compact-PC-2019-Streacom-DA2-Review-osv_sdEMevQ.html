big compromises whether it's noise
cooling or expandability and those tend
to scare a lot of people off but not
today it's like having a space heater
the craziest thing to me about all of
this you can't even hear it
so streak on set out to build a case
that uses a unique modular rail system
to allow high-performance components to
fit comfortably in a small form-factor
and we're gonna find out just how
comfortably that can be done
thanks to see sonic who sponsored this
third installment of our compact
powerhouse build series your PSU is the
heart of your system and see sonic is a
leader in the category offering
efficient power supplies with
outstanding features and performance for
your next build or upgrade check out see

video description
starting on the outside the da2 is the
perfect case for the minimalist Mac user
who has a PC at home because gaming on
Mac OS is a subpar experience at best in
typical street comm fashion the entire
case is beautifully finished in either
black or silver brushed aluminum and in
keeping with the minimalistic design
there's no RGB anywhere honestly the
things kind of a breath of fresh air in
a market that's crowded with rainbow
unicorn bonnet on the front the only i/o
you get is a power button with an
integrated power LED and a single USB
3.2 gen one five gigabit port now this
is something I was a little torn on
because I'm all for switching literally
all the things over to USB type-c but
the thing is most desktop peripherals
still use type-a so not having at least
one regular port and audio it might have
been nice to is a significant compromise
that is unless you've got an external
USB sound card and a USB hub on your
desk or built into your monitor which I
do in which case I guess you probably
won't care the stock side panels don't
come with a window but rather are nicely
perforated for airflow so if you're not
much into cable management then that's a
plus for you but if you do like to strut
your stuff Street comm has you covered
there as well with their tempered glass
side panel kit with that said that side
panel will limit your cooling options
more on that later at the back the i/o
situation is pretty solid with a 90
millimeter fan slot and full access to
both the motherboard and GPUs i/o and
the only shortcoming here is the
positioning of the power supply
pass-through it's right above the GPU
which means it's basically impossible to
cleanly route it in case you have the
glass side panel it will probably get
covered by your CPU cooler but your
mileage may vary now removing the side
panel is a bit unique it's actually just
held on by the friction of these little
rubber mounts which is both confusing at
first and a blessing in the future
because you'll probably be pleased but
you don't
to go find a screwdriver huh here's one
to get inside and inside is where the
da2 starts to get really interesting
like don't get me wrong
brushed aluminum definitely gets the
juices flowing but modularity that would
be my kryptonite and conveniently it's
where the DA two shines so the inside of
this case is essentially just a metal
frame
there's no motherboard tray no front
panel and no power supply mount these
features instead get screwed into the
base chassis so in much the same way
that a car company can build multiple
different cars on the same basic frame
you could technically build multiple
different configurations in the same
case so their first party accessories
allow for a vertical GPU mount the
tempered glass panels we mentioned
earlier and even an inverted motherboard
layout but if you're a bit handy the
possibilities go even further than that
so let's take a look at the rail system
you pretty much just slide the mounting
rails wherever you want to mount
something and then screw them in you can
use them for a pump hard drive fan maybe
even a secret place to store that
Nickelback CD that you don't want anyone
knowing about it's okay
we don't judge so to start with we
wanted to see how the da2 would handle a
pretty normal but clearly enthusiast
level gaming rig overall the build
process was fairly smooth thanks to the
modularity of the case you can take off
all the external panels allowing for 360
degree access making the usual ITX build
headache a lot more manageable you can
use a regular ATX size power supply in
the da2 but you'll lose most of the
space on the storage bracket as well as
most of your GPU space so instead we
went for a 650 watt SFX power supply
from c sonic with all of that installed
we've got to try out the rail system and
it's actually super easy to use all of
the components are nice and rigid just
screw a rail onto each side of whatever
you're mounting slide the rails onto the
mounting screws and tighten we did
notice that more premium all-in-ones
like the course RH 100 Ivy to that we're
using can be tricky to mount because
of how thick and rigid the tubing is so
we'd recommend something with thinner
tubing if you plan to do this yourself
so just button it all up and well BAM
finished sexy rig so we've got Metro
Exodus running RTX is enabled and this
is at 1440p should be pushing our 20/80
pretty hard I guess we should check the
temps right yeah I guess so
you can definitely hear it yeah it's
gonna say the the fans pretty apparent I
mean I wouldn't describe it as loud but
yeah from like a seated distance it's
not too bad it's noticeable it's
noticeable and especially when you
consider that it's not that small yeah
but it's also not that big and you know
if you have a regular Founders card it
seems to be kind of the noise level
you're going to get I mean this
obviously doesn't have the same level of
sound deadening as like a and our six or
something like that but I think it's
it's good enough I mean every time you
die it's just gonna screw it up a little
bit you should probably just stay in
this room for a couple minutes haryana
stay in the room you know I'm not gonna
die this time that's fine we just need
to check what we're boosting to anyway
okay yeah I'm we're boosting anywhere
from around 1830 to 1860 and tubs not
bad well stamps are gonna be 82 right
because they are always there 80 excuse
me yeah quite there but yes but they
always are and CPU just over 50 okay so
we're getting honestly about what we'd
expect from a decent mid Tower yeah I'm
not really surprised at all but I mean
it's smaller probably half the size of a
regular mid Tower it's not less
all right let's pop this thing off so
that doesn't mean there's not room for
improvement though so the motherboard
area actually does get a fair amount of
cool air drawn over it and we could even
improve that by throwing a 92 millimeter
fan here at the back because we've got
our a i/o drawing air from sort of the
filters at the top and the bottom and
then pushing it out the side but our GPU
we actually found the ambient air just
around it was quite hot and it's just
kind of sitting in its own recycled
exhaust I think if we put a fan of the
front that maybe
better but you can't really it's right
completely flat you know I was thinking
maybe if they had sort of to expand on
the modularity a panel in the front that
you could remove and if you didn't want
a fan up front you could just put a flat
piece or another option if you've got
room for a dual rad then you've got room
for two single Brad's what if we
water-cooled the GPU what if we just
custom water cooled the whole thing okay
so confession time this is Linus tech
tips and we never really intended for
this to be just a regular case review
because one of the first things that
stood out to us about the da2
is that while it's not that small for a
super compact case as long as you stick
with the perforated side panel it
supports a two hundred and eighty
millimeter AIO liquid cooler and where
you can fit in a i/o you can fit a
custom loop if you're determined enough
of course we weren't just gonna water
cool the 9700 K and 2080
that wasn't gonna cut it rather we
wanted to go with something a little
more extreme Edition like the core I 999
ATX see it fits perfectly onto as rocks
x2 9090 ITX motherboard which is pretty
much the most badass ITX platform to
ever exist
and we slapped on a bits power mono
block to keep the VRMs nice and cool
then after mounting one of EJ's gorgeous
blocks onto our Titan r-tx
and installing it things started to get
a bit tricky now we didn't intend to
mount just one radiator rather we
figured with a small amount of
modification we could put a second ultra
slim excess PC radiator under the GPU
now that it was only a single slot with
some slim scythe fans mounted to the
bottom
thanks to performance pcs for sending
that over by the way we mounted that
through the bottom filter and it wasn't
all that difficult but it was becoming
clear but even with the super small
power supply and DD c-- pump there was
no way we were fitting a reservoir in
here that wasn't gonna stop us though
even if we needed to use a vacuum pump
to fill the darn loop thankfully using a
tee fitting to fill combined
with a bit of patience we were able to
get it juiced up the last challenge then
was Kayla management with the DA - I
don't think they really put a ton of
effort into this but you do have just
enough room to tuck away all the excess
cable from a stock SFX power supply with
lots of mounting points coincidentally
on the rail system if you had custom
cables you'd be an even better shape so
it's done I gotta say this is an
absolutely incredible amount of raw
power for the size like it's smooth yeah
any move we might not get a better
gaming experience than the previous set
up because it's obviously not optimized
for gaming you know an 18 core but what
holy crap and the craziest thing to me
about all of this you can't even hear it
like I can feel it yeah yeah yeah like
it's like having a space heater next to
you like do you have do you have a
stress test running in the background
right now this is just the game oh wow
like the metal of the case is like warm
to the touch I left it for a couple
hours earlier and it's like the whole
case it's just like burning hot but
these fans are barely running yeah the
parts like the actual CPU and GPU it's
themselves are at a very reasonable
temperature silent yeah so there's two
Noctua fans on here that are each
running at a thousand rpm and then you
got the slim scythe ones that they're
not PDM controllable so I just put them
to like 30% duty thank you you can't
even see them at a normal angle either
like it's absolutely crazy alright so
for a final torture test I've gone ahead
and fired up 32 threads of prime95 so
that leaves 4 threads for our game still
running good and we're still running
Metro Exodus and at least to my eye this
is too pretty turns I mean this is like
400 to 500 watts in a box this size so
no guarantees it's actually still
running particularly well and yeah if we
check out afterburner our boost clock on
our GPU is down to like 1600 megahertz
and change that that's a little on the
low side our CPU still looks good though
around 60 70 degrees so yeah don't do
stupid things like this but other than
that this is a pretty freakin incredible
machine thanks good job oh that was
really rough so in conclusion for all
its beauty
the da2 does require a little bit of
extra work to truly shine like you don't
necessarily have to go as far as we did
with full custom liquid cooling maybe
you could make you could modify an a IO
to run both your CPU and GPU or run to
single 140 millimeters one for each or
something like that it's just that
without that it still does force you to
compromise a little bit whether on
cooling or on acoustics though in
fairness I guess that does make sense it
is just 17.5 litres and if you're
willing to dial back your crazy specs or
get creative it's got a lot else going
for it it's incredibly modular with a
stunning mentalistic design that would
make even Jony ive proud I think the
only thing really missing here is a rose
gold color option it's making of options
if you do end up buying a da2 for your
next build or really any case you should
pair it up with a power supply from see
sonic they've got tons of options
see how that's getting it for super
efficient and high quality power
supplies with excellent performance at
all ranges of different price points and
wattages they've got bottles that are
perfect for small and compact builds
like this one all the way up to full
sized ATX power supplies for your epic
battle station like in our gaming lounge
pcs so check them out at the link in the
video description for your next build so
