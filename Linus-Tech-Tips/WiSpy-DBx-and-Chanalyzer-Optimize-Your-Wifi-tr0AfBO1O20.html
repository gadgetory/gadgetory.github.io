played around with in a long time it's
an expensive program solution but if you
or a client is having an impossible
issue with a wireless network it could
absolutely save your bacon oh and I'll
cover some more practical stuff for home
users as well welcome to how to optimize
your Wi-Fi I guess the flash voyager GTX
USB 3 drive from Corsair provides SSD
like performance and fits comfortably in
your pocket click now to learn more now
in a perfect fantasy world only two
Wi-Fi devices would be in one place at
one time
an access point and a single client that
would work awesome unfortunately in the
real world that's not really how it goes
down and you'll have sometimes dozens of
devices chattering at the same time now
Wi-Fi devices are designed to be very
polite and not talk over each other so
as long as they're all on the same
channel every device will wait it's turn
to communicate which means there's a
finite amount of communication that can
be done per channel once you reach that
limit you're pretty much done there are
a couple of solutions though solution
number one is to change the operating
channel of your wireless equipment but
that needs to be done with care if you
weren't in considerate neighbor chooses
overlapping channels that complicates
communication because instead of every
device waiting it's turn to communicate
they'll all just kind of try to yell on
top of each other so choose
non-overlapping channels the problem is
that in the 2.4 gigahertz band there are
only three non-overlapping channels so
that's still a very finite amount of
communication that can be done which
leads to solution number two reduce
other wireless signals this can be done
by asking very close neighbors to kindly
turn down their antenna strength by
turning off unnecessary Wi-Fi hotspots
and by wiring up as many devices as you
can so not every piece of electronic
gear in your house is competing for
airtime this kind of tweaking is
actually pretty easy to do with either
meta gates in SSID or for tool or an
Android app like Wi-Fi analyzer but one
of these solutions
emotions what if these solutions don't
work it's possible there's a non Wi-Fi
device interfering with your network
switching to newer dual-band five
gigahertz wireless equipment is one
solution that will probably work because
while ranges are slightly reduced there
are many more available channels and
much less equipment that uses them but
in an office environment where you can't
control what people are using or even in
the home it's not always an option so
this is the Y spy dbx from Metta geek
this professional-grade device combined
with the Wi-Fi card in your PC and Metta
geeks channel Iser software is a
powerful spectrum analysis tool that
lets you visualize the 2.4 gigahertz or
5 gigahertz wireless activity around you
including both Wi-Fi networks and non
Wi-Fi compliant interferes the device
itself is pretty straightforward
included in the Box is this little black
box and antenna a USB to cable and a
little clip that you can use to attach
it to your PC like so this is the way
I'd recommend using it since diagnosing
interferers is often going to be a
pretty active process with a lot of
running around let's get into the
software so first we'll take a look at
both density and waterfall view which
show real-time and historical wireless
activity and they both use the x-axis to
show which channel the signal is being
transmitted on but you still use them a
little bit differently so density view
shows us the amplitude of the activity
on the y-axis so how loud a device is
talking and uses color coding from blue
to red to indicate how often it's
talking this red blip right here is
transmitting all the time but it's not
very loud while the one here only
transmits around 10% of the time but is
so loud that it's either very powerful
or very close by waterfall view works
more like a seismograph where the
amplitude of the signal is color-coded
now and how often it happens is
represented by how often the dots appear
in a vertical line so back to our
previous examples that red spot now has
a constant blue color code and we see
lots and lots and lots of activity in
that line while the tall blue peak has
less frequent but red
our coded activity one more trick here
is that we can use the navigation
feature on the left is kind of a PVR to
see anything from a short recent
30-second snapshot for on-the-fly
diagnoses of issues to hours of recorded
activity to get a really clear idea of
what's going on in that area throughout
the day just don't forget to create
sessions so you know where you were and
what you were trying to monitor at the
time all right so enough theory I
promise this was a cool gadget let's
play with it shall we here's the 2.4
gigahertz frequency range around the
office
lots of SS IDs we can see them
broadcasting with that faint blue halo
some of them are strong others aren't
none of them have particularly intense
activity going on for now one thing you
might notice if we overlay the Wi-Fi
networks though is that the
configuration here is a total mess one
of ours is on channel 2 and seems to
have Auto configured itself to 40
megahertz a performance boost in theory
but with so much other traffic going on
around here it's probably not helping
anyone and there are a couple of other
nearby networks on overlapping channels
too yeah but that stuff's easy we don't
need a fancy tool for that so let's take
a look at what different kinds of
traffic look like it's kind of cool so
this is what low bitrate buffered video
playback on a mobile phone looks like
when we have our spectrum analyzer
these short bursts mean that we're
nowhere near saturating our connection
this on the other hand is what high
bitrate 1080p playback looks like not
nearly as many gaps between data
transmission in order to build the
buffer might have a hard time running
multiple streams of this at the same
time and then ha big leagues now NVIDIA
game stream this is why they have a
recommended list of high quality routers
to stream games over your Wi-Fi network
there is no buffer time in between
transmission because low latency is key
so data needs to be moving constantly
and without any interruptions but all
this is stuff that's relatively easy to
diagnose because it's Wi-Fi here what
about the real reason we got this tool
non Wi-Fi stuff whoo whoa there what's
that out of nowhere we've got a device
hopping around thankfully outside of
our Wi-Fi channels whose red color
indicates at least 50 percent air time
use this one in this case it's a g930
headphone from logitech wireless
headphones
this one is well-behaved but many
devices like baby monitors will
accidentally jump on top of your Wi-Fi
from time to time causing interruptions
now you know switching over to five
gigahertz the first things that jump out
are how little background interference
there is and how many more channels are
available if I had capable gear I could
actually spread right out and run a
couple of 40 megahertz or even 80
megahertz quadruple wide channel access
points for massive throughput sure we
right there's not much to see here
otherwise but just for fun let's have a
look at what it looks like if I run
iperf on my phone to simulate heavy
network activity and then truck myself
downstairs where the access point is the
intensity of the activity doesn't change
in the density of you but you can see
the amplitude increases dramatically so
this hot and cold style of discovery
based on the strength of the signal can
actually be used in some really
interesting ways let's pop back over to
2.4 gigahertz for a second what the heck
are these two blue spikes here that
don't look like Wi-Fi they don't have a
Wi-Fi shape the software lets us find
out by using the inspector feature to
highlight them and basically run around
with the laptop looking for the signal
strength to increase or decrease turns
out it was a 2.4 gigahertz RC airplane
radio it's things like this and other
non Wi-Fi 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz
stuff that can be infuriating to
diagnose without a tool like this but if
at this point you're sitting there
thinking ok line is so I spend $1000 on
a piece of hardware and software license
so that I can yell at the neighbor kid
for flying is dub plane are you dumb no
the why spy the less expensive 2.4
gigahertz only model and the Wi-Fi dbx
are for pros who set up like Wi-Fi
networks for a living for normal people
there's the stuff I mentioned before or
Wi-Fi helper which is a wizard-based $10
tool that walks you through optimizing
your network probably
better bet unless you've got like I
don't know microwave next to your
computer that's constantly running
that's what it looks like by the way no
wonder you can't stream video while
you're cooking your Hot Pocket am i
