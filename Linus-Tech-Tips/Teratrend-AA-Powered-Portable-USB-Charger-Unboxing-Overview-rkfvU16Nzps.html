everyone in their dog has where you plug
it in with a USB port and you charge up
the battery that's built in and then you
can take it around with you and you can
give your devices an extra boost
actually I guess we're kind of in the
shader me you can give your device as an
extra boost of power or just charge
things on the go all that kind of thing
great concept love them I have one I use
it all the time but the thing that was
kind of missing for me was one that
doesn't need to be charged so what I
would find happening was I would use it
on a flight to somewhere I'd forget to
charge the bank itself and then on the
way back I've discovered that it was
dead so this is a product from terra
trend by silverstone basically by
silverstone penn shaped mobile charger
utilizing double-a batteries so i think
that's pretty self-explanatory supports
install a a battery times two USBA type
female interface easy to carry and
compact design now i asked for a pink
one and i guess they figured I must have
mistyped because they sent a green one
too but the one that I actually want is
the pink one so check this out they
showed this off at CES and we actually
did see it in their booth but I just
want to show you guys how this works so
there you go super simple just like that
you unscrew the bottom it's made of
aluminum it feels really solid it's got
a nice anodized finish on the outside so
I mean it's it's made by Silverstone
which is pretty much all you need to
know so it's good you throw a couple
batteries in there you can use
rechargeables or disposable batteries
it's up to you so there's your contact
point you go ahead and screw this back
on and then this is a quick way to turn
double-a batteries into USB power so now
all you got to do is toggle the switch
here and there's your USB charger so
it's a 500 milliamp hour charge or I
believe yeah 500 milliamp sorry not
million hour that's a rating for the
capacity 500 milliamp charger so you're
not going to be able to quickly charge
like speed charge a phone or charge a
tablet at any sort of appreciable rate
but what it is is it's a handy little
thing that you can carry around in a
backpack or whatever else it's going to
be durable and you're going to be able
to take an otherwise standard thing
you can buy at a store and quickly
convert it into something that you can
charge your device with or top-up your
device with so there you go I mean I
think if you can see the application for
it then you see the application for it
and if you can't then you can just tell
me Linus I don't see the application for
it I don't know why you made a video
about this and I'll say well come on
it's like a pink stick but batteries in
it must be good don't forget to
subscribe for this tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos oh yeah it's available in a
variety of colors maybe that was the
point of sending me the green one so you
don't have to get a pink one so you can
get green or I think there's like three
other colors
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
