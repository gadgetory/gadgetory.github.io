little different I'm gonna let John kind
of explain the premise because I had him
on when show like two months ago it was
way too long and we were like yeah we
need to do a collab and then I was
traveling and then he had some goofball
Apple event he had to something or
whatever I wasn't there um now we're
finally doing it we are gonna have the
ultimate debate iOS versus Android but
John how's it gonna work all right so
we're gonna do this we're gonna make
this fun here's what we're gonna do
so it's about against the two months
since I was on Linus the show we want to
debate iOS vs. Android but we figure
instead of one of us picking aside we're
gonna do a two fav style and flip a coin
for who's going to get what side and if
you want to watch my part obviously
watch it on on my channel if you want to
watch the Linus's part hit the link down
below and go watch it on his channel you
can get a better sense of you know what
he's got to say and we could run through
everything together
freshbooks is the super simple online
invoicing solution that lets you stay
organized save time and get paid faster
click on my net to start your free trial
today all right heads as iOS tails is
Android and we're flipping for my topic
are you ready yeah all right we're
flipping for you're losing topic I
should say tails look at a mix-up you
are gonna be on the losing side of
Android and I am going to talk about the
glory that is iOS all right well we're
gonna start right off with the
beautifully crafted workmanship which is
a big load of bollocks right off the hop
here because Android has a customizable
experience so you're not locked into
well gee what if I actually wanted more
than just a five by four grid of icons
on my home screens that I can swipe to
and from just like this and nothing
other than that with Android you can
change up your launcher you can throw an
AV eight launcher on there I mean iOS
did you see Tim Cook on stage talking I
don't even remember who it was it was
some some guy from Apple doesn't really
matter talking about how now when you
wake up in the morning you can fire up
your meditation app contextually from
the lock screen how is that a feature
what if I don't want to meditate that
morning what if I want to check my email
what if it's gonna wreck my meditation
that I can't see my email before I
meditate is that innovation on the iOS
side this is going to be a really easy
slam dunk debate so you know you said it
was so cool you could twist your Android
phone to launch it well just pick up
another Android phone Frank switch to
launch it is it gonna do it nope because
you my friend have too much
fragmentation maybe one phone does if
you got our phone doesn't let's say you
upgrade from your last generation Moto X
to a new Nexus 6 for example you're like
oh great I know how this is gonna work
you do not know how that's going to work
out learn something brand new with every
version of Android you're very unlikely
ever going to have the latest at Google
has to offer which means you are like
wide-open legs
red waiting for viruses I mean it just
this is come come at me Trojan comes
give it to me all yeah you can customize
times we're going to go through and
actually download os is going to tweak
gonna tweak skins the out-of-the-box
experience on iOS it's so easy and so
seamless and that's the beauty of what
Apple provide you pick up an Android
phone your app experience might be
incredibly far off apple offers
consistencies you know what you're
getting you know it's going to work
nails well friend ecosystem a seamless
eCos is not going to work you're gonna
have continuity to answer your phone
calls from your tablet it just make it
simpler and simpler my friends better so
I heard a whole lot of Apple fanboying
over there I didn't hear any valid
points you know what how excited were
the Apple fanboys when Apple started
putting accelerometers and gyroscopes in
their phone they were like oh my god now
it has a compass did they complain that
they complain that you know oh now I
don't understand how to use this compass
this is so confusing
you know what it probably did cuz their
Apple fanboys Wow
this is just like my last phone what
tremendous innovation that's what you
get on the Apple side you get the same
damn experience every single time and
you get a last gen experience anyway
because they are innovating so much
slower years after the release of the
galaxy note they acknowledged people's
desire for larger phones and then they
missed the point entirely the point of
the larger phone is the more tablet like
large battery experience with which
quite frankly Apple has their head stuck
so far up their asses about delivering a
long battery life experience that I
don't think they're ever gonna get it
they're just gonna keep making it
thinner and keep making it so that you
have actual dps somewhere you're gonna
run it about every halfway through the
day you're gonna be carrying around half
a dozen stupid battery banks in your
pocket and what good do your fancy shiny
by the way more expensive apps to you if
your phone is dead so what I'm hearing
from you is that Bing first is better if
that was true how's your a new windows
mobile phone working out you've been
using
we'd all be using window
mobile phones first to come out was
always better I would rather have see
that's going to work and work well than
be a beta test of some new technology
that's so how was Google Wallet first
came out everybody use it immediately no
Apple fine-tuned what they needed to do
and they got that right when Apple
Wallet finally came out Apple pay came
out and invoking the fanboy name because
people prefer one over the other you
know that silly its commenters do it and
you always say don't pick sides beside
you pick though I'm gonna say it right
here is wrong what I think you have to
agree about is Apple prides itself on
being innovative and quite frankly
nothing they showed off at WDC was
innovative in fact they even made me
look stupid I thought that exposing the
rest of your windows to pop up the other
side was innovative turns out that's
been in the Windows 10 preview all this
time
so that's apples fault clearly that I
didn't know that so what I'm hearing is
you not wanting to talk about Iowa firs
Android I've got another topic because
you know that you've lost
if you thought WWDC was boring react
Google i/o that almost fell asleep I had
to be making jokes and I had a key the
whole time on Twitter because I was so
boy they're talking about you know
what's exciting let's spend 45 minutes
talking about api's nothing sexier than
that
45 minutes talking about API so
basically all Apple did back the api's
everybody we're gonna talk about it's
all one oh now you got to make a ho
Apple run a show Drake was there the
weekend was there they had sense of
humor about themselves cares if Drake is
there okay hold on a second uh-huh going
through tech now Canada
everybody loves game of trachea right
innovation is that you can make
standalone apps for the I watch whose
screen doesn't even turn on unless you
do a gesture that's that's innovation
Google's Android wear has had apps
running directly off of the device since
ages ago
and you should probably save yeah
they've had that burning directly off
the watch from ages ago but only running
off to watch for half the day because in
the batter
is gonna die you know what this breaks
it down for me
does your Android phone that you bought
did it come up with antivirus software
installed on it it doesn't need to I
have never had I bought a set most
Android phones comes pre-installed with
antivirus should tell you absolutely
everything at least I know when I put in
my bank information to my phone it's
going to stay on my phone and not end up
in somebody else's database somewhere
else yeah that's what you think smart
guy I'm sure the NSA has got it figured
out you're American so you're
compromised regardless man come on
you're gonna play that card
oh it's the NSA big scared we talked
about OS is here iOS is more secure than
Android every day of the week every day
of the year here it's more secure
operator okay so you're gonna pull up
that stupid Windows Phone low-blow fine
then why don't you go use blackberry
smart guy whoa whoa whoa don't get hasty
hold on a second no son don't get AC now
now that's not necessary so I think
you've clearly run out of ways to defend
apples shiny phones that only have one I
would do this all day only your buttons
cuz the OS is elegant easy to throw a
ton of buttons on there dude you need to
do the OS is elegant
you know what's elegant double tapping
the home button to bring down the the
one handed mode and move all your icons
down because they can't build a UI
that's actually optimized for the size
of their phone and on that note I want
to leave it up to you guys the audience
to tell us who you thought won leave a
like on my video which is linked in
John's video description and leave a

the more elegant OS and the better
hardware so that's how you're gonna play
it if you're gonna act all you're gonna
