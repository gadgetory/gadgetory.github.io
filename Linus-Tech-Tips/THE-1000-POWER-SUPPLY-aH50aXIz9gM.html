this year to check out the new rise in
processors check out the link in the
description down below we are here at
Coolermaster checking out the master
watt maker 1200 mij made in Japan I saw
this at Computex and mostly ignored it
because it cost way too much money and I
didn't pay enough attention to it and it
deserves that much attention so we were
checking out today it cost $1000 but
don't worry about it if that matters to
you this product isn't for you you can
still watch because it's freaking
beautiful but it's probably for someone
else I'm not going to buy one personally
it's this is engineering beauty let's
start off with the mij made in japan why
does that matter have you heard of
Mirada maybe they send like probes into
space and do crazy stuff like that they
said well no that went super far and it
came all the way back it was really cool
don't worry about it they spent three
years with 40 of their engineers to make
this ATX power supply that's epic and I
mean Coolermaster did contribute to they
put a Silencio fan in there it's 130
millimeters I'm just kidding this was a
collaboration throughout the entire
process and they have created something
that is in my opinion a work of art in
terms of engineering although I would
have liked if it was clear this is the
final product which also looks super
cool but just like the old-school
Gameboy isn't like n64 s I want to see
the awesomeness inside is a beautiful
middle list minimalistic product but
there you go you can sort of see it so
what inside of here actually makes the
device as a whole awesome well to be
completely honest the electrical
engineering is way above my head but the
stuff that they're pointing out is their
common choke their PFC choke their
Japanese caps which have been a staple
in the computing industry for a very
long time and their innovative
transformer all that put together gives
you a power supply that exceeds titanium
efficiency and that price tag gives you
this amazing unboxing experience which
is unlike any power supply unboxing that
I've ever done
you take these boxes out of the side
pockets unzipper them and you have all
of your cables nicely laid out in their
own little individual pouches oh so nice
so what now we've seen the amazing
unboxing experience you've seen the
power supply and all of its minimalistic
glory you've talked to
at the made in Japan awesomeness and
Morada sending probes to space
personally I'm gonna wait for the Jonny
guru review they have told me that
they're going to send one to him I would
highly suggest if you are genuinely
interested in this power supply that you
wait to read that because you will
probably be even more interested once he
explains all of the awesomeness in
greater detail thanks again to AMD for
sponsoring our CES 2017 content their
new Vega GPU will introduce a new memory
architecture that sports high bandwidth
cache to learn more about Vega visit vga
and also check out after the uprising on
youtube which we have linked here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
