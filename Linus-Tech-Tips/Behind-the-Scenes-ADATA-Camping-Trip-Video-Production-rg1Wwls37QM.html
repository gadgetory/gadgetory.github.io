shoot today you'll probably know who who
murdered him 7:10 sharp apparently means
7:15 we're heading over to the island
for a shoot today
I realized I did not have time to make
myself a burger so I had a banana we
should totally film like a we're on a
boat thing for behind the scenes then
we're on the boat it would actually be
kind of funny we probably shouldn't do
that I'm just gonna get kicked off the
boat and when you get kicked off the
boat you die so they stop selling
tickets ten minutes before boarding and
we are getting to the terminal 12
minutes before boarding time or
departure time not boarding time which
is different so everyone's been
stressing me out this morning by fire by
not having us be at the terminal if time
is there we've never been to this
terminal before so we don't really even
know where to buy tickets oh so ticket
sales and 15 minutes prior to sailing it
is whatever time it is right now I can
look at my other my other phone that
also has a timepiece on it so it's 817
which you guys can't see at all but the
point is I got my tickets at 8:15 walked
up to the counter as they were saying
last call for Anna 9mo so we got this
and we didn't even speed on the way here
this is what I love this is the urgency
of like being in a hurry
sure they actually used a special
technology to make your waffles cool
maybe after they came off of the waffle
iron like maybe they actually use light
like a cold cook yeah well apparently
there are orcas on the starboard side
which we all think might be this side
but we don't see them we should be right
then unless we're going backwards we
could be going backwards I wouldn't know
the difference show off the the van that
we've got here and apparently everyone's
really cozy back there I'm just gonna
I'm gonna restart the car yeah sorry
gotta go gotta go really yeah oh okay
all right off we go it's time to move
the the car here so I guess I'll put it
in reverse
no no no no right there that's it that
makes sense so my whole thought was we
should do a Linus Media Group camping
trip based on like how awesome this
place is we're at living forest
campground incidentally and we asked van
ventures dot CA so might as well you
know give them give them soda a whole
you know pimp out thing here to
basically you know put camping stuff in
the van we didn't really give much
clarification because we're not actually
camping we're just setting up a fake
campsite and so he you know came up with
some chairs and tents and you know
cookware and like you know whatever
those are called this place is gorgeous
beautiful how many Linus media group
employees does it take to pitch a tent
trick question they can all do it at the
same time because it's a chain reaction
makes near our campsite which makes
sense because its nature there's another
one over here that had a red stripe on
it that means safety red and yellow
markings for safety right
I'm trying to get a rock right now in
case anyone's wondering what I'm doing
Oh everyone's of course helping me by
providing moral support that's true
got my campaign shirt on here behind the
scenes
you look pretty like right now I do
making my face here oh you got some
money your eye or eyelid I something but
not your actual eye scenes it's my big
it's my big tent scene here got my face
yeah got my crying cuz I was watching a
real sad movie am I getting myself yeah
so yeah it's a really good thing that
they clarify this because I wasn't quite
sure if this was that frypan or not yeah
they made sure that I knew that it's
fried pen number eight yeah number eight
like there's eight of them exactly eight
fry pans for me in Canada
I think GSW is probably the company not
made in Canada I said were made in can i
yes because Canadian and North American
for that matter manufacturing is dead
behind the scenes is full of social
commentary there's a test run they're
like wow that cost a lot of money let's
not do that
the first Linus Media Group campfire
good job that's just like yeah yeah
wow just wow I think I don't think it's
gonna light you have to light the bottom
don't don't blow it out you're not
letting the bottom either I should fire
you both there we go that is half it's
time I don't think this is gonna light
no no don't do that that's that is not
how you like English
have you ever lit a fire fire so we're
dropping off our our tinted scary van
with the tear stains in the back no just
kidding it was great and this is
interesting all right so we actually
told the cabbie the wrong spot we told
the cabbie like the other end of the
street so I'm gonna go drop off the keys
while we move our junk because I don't
want the cab to like leaving us to not
get on the boat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
