them back officially and we are starting
things up with a product that I'm sure
the manufacturer expected me to open in
a timely manner I mean look at this Josh
from fractal where's that label Josh
from fractal sent this thing via
international to day do you have any
idea how expensive that is
it is now whatever the date is today May
the 7th and I haven't even touched it
yet so let's go ahead and open up the
define s from fractal design oh I sliced
the handrail crap
Intel 750 series drives feature the new
nvme standard for never-before-seen
performance from a consumer-grade SSD
click now to learn more good packaging I
got going on here there we go alright
well that's a reassuring sound hopefully
didn't get broken and shipping so the
concept we find behind the define S is
for fractal design to have a case that
is less expensive than their flagship
define our series while offering the
same build quality the same aesthetics
and actually even better options for
water cooling for their liquid cooling
aficionado customers so it looks like I
got the windowed side panel version but
there is also a non windowed version
here not that into the whole staring at
your hardware thing but I would make the
argument that for someone who's into
liquid cooling the odds of them
preferring the windowed one is pretty
darn good now fractal has done in recent
years a much better job of packaging and
the define S is no exception nice thick
foam it's not soft foam but the fact
that it's nice and thick the fact that
the case is heavy but not overly heavy
means that it should be in pretty good
shape by the time it gets to you you've
got an accessory box right around there
it's got some screws inside also
reservoir brackets whoo exciting and
then a user guide which usually they
kind of suck no offense to fractal
design but let's give them a chance to
have it not suck the builder's guide
with optional steps you don't even have
to do those things
fascinating ok actually naturally not
shabby alright so let's open up the case
and find out what's clanking around
inside there
oh my side panels came undone in
shipping so unlike the define r5 the
define s does not feature the latching
side panel mechanism however they have
improved it in one regard so you can see
here they now use captive thumb screws
on both the left and right side panel
which means that you won't lose them
compared to the define our five it also
features a much wider side panel window
which makes sense since in the front of
the case instead of having a whole bunch
of harddrive cages which should be noted
on the define our five are actually
removable and reconfigurable part of why
it's more expensive instead of having
those you should actually have things
like oh I don't know a liquid filled
reservoir or something like that that's
got like you know UV glowy liquid all
over the inside of it or something along
those lines and you can see they give
you a ton like a metric but ton of
options in terms of mounting whether you
got one of those little dinky cylinder
reza's or one of those super long
cylinder reza's it will feel at home in
here now in terms of the rest of the
features it's pretty much open in here
so you've got a large CPU cut out you've
got seven PCI slots you've got an
included 140 millimeter fan at the back
and an additional one in the front
you've got your power supply mounting
complete with anti vibrational little
foam bits here and at the back and then
you've got this hard drive sled which
we'll get into a little bit more later
at the bottom you got mounting for a 120
or 140 millimeter fan as well as
mounting holes for the most popular
pumps on the market so you can go ahead
and you can mount your DD C or your d5
pump natively here which are the only
ones I'd really recommend using
especially the D 5 I'm not a huge fan of
the DD C your front panel connectors are
all black except for the blue on the end
of the USB 3.0 connector and all
adequately labeled with things like
power LED positive power LED ground
clearly indicated you've got your cable
management grom it's not a ton of them
but I'd say enough so one for the 8 pin
one for the 24 pin and one for all the
sick graphic cards gonna put in there
and oh let's go ahead and have a look at
the front of the case we never really
got
to do the tour of the outside because it
went and opened itself for us so at the
front you've got the usual brushed
plasticky looking finish that we've seen
on the define our series for quite some
time except oh what's this it actually
doesn't open it all so these vents on
the side here are going to be for your
front intake and they are actually quite
spacious you can look right through them
like that and other than that that's
nothing there is no five and a quarter
inch bays there is no opening up front
door on the top you can see another
cost-saving measure so we've got front
audio a reset switch a power switch that
is illuminated I believe it looks like
as well as two USB 3.0 ports but no
additional two USB 2.0 ports also on the
top we've got the same mod you vent
system from the define r5 so you can pop
off one two or three of these depending
on how many fans you have installed on
that side and then around on the other
side we find not a whole lot of much of
anything and the same goes for the back
let's go ahead and pop off this side
panel and hey look at that the fan
spinning itself it's like a windmill oh
well that was short-lived alright so on
the back here we've got yes where that
three and half inch drive mounting cage
would have wanted to go back to at some
point here I can figure out there we go
so it goes in a little something like
that no harm no foul fractal design I
forgive you for this thing falling on
shipping international to day do you
have any idea how expensive that is so
back here you've got your drive mounting
options I said no five and a quarter but
that doesn't mean that you can't
actually mount a fair number of drives
you can do three three and a half inch
or two and a half inch drives on these
cages with their connectors oriented
towards this side that allows you to
plug them into the ample cable
management room back here so you can go
ahead and sneak your SATA data and SATA
power connectors in there and then you
can actually mount an additional two two
and a half inch drives directly under
the CPU socket area right here so these
also mount on little removable sleds you
screw them in to that you pop them into
the back huge improvement over that one
case I can't was it the defining r4 I
think where you had to actually screw
the SSD and from the other side of the
motherboard another improve
lentes fractal design is now including
these velcro straps for cable management
you'll probably still need to use some
zip ties but it's much less of a huge
deal once you've got at least a few
reusable ones wouldn't mind seeing
another one here and I guess that's
pretty much all there is to say about
the back there's enough room even at the
in the narrowest portion for a 24-pin
connector as long as you don't cross too
many things overtop of it but do factor
in that on the inside of the side panel
is that noise dampening material that
we've seen on fractal designs other
silence optimized cases something to
notice if you want the windowed version
you do pay a little bit more even though
the funny thing is I'm pretty sure that
a piece of acrylic is actually cheaper
than the noise dampening material
they're using so I'm not quite sure if I
understand the cost structure they're
back around to the front you can put up
to a triple 120 or triple 140 millimeter
radiator into the filtered there we go
see if you can figure out to get that
bad boy out
filtered front intake come out you
bastard oh right now this is what
happens when you try and figure these
cases out in real time that's magnetic
it's actually kind of smart so it hinges
on there and then magnets on there so
what did I say yeah triple 120s or
triple 140s in the front and then you
can actually do up to a slim triple 140
or a thick triple 120 in the top as well
the reason for the slim requirement on
the triple 140 is you're going to have
issues with motherboard clearance since
those 140 millimeter radiators are going
to go somewhere over in the neighborhood
of I think like here if I can't actually
find the mounting holes I'm not too
stressed about it I don't stress about
things these days so I think that's
pretty much it
who is this case for well it's for water
coolers who basically wanted to define
our v and want to save 10 or 20 bucks
mission accomplished then fractal design
mission accomplished speaking of mission
accomplished master opcom they've got
all kinds of great deals if you never
heard of mass drop you should go check
it out we've got a link in the video
description we've probably also got a
link in the lower third that's
presumably sitting under me
now but the whole idea behind it is
members of their community find deals
and then mass drop works directly with
the manufacturers and suppliers to get
authentic merchandise at lower prices
but there's a catch there's the mass so
we've got to drop the price goes down
but the mass means the more people buy
it the lower the price goes to a
predefined limit
we've actually got a featured drop for
you guys today ah yes we've got a
coolermaster V 1200 power supply for as
low as 239 shipped to the US so that's
an 80 plus platinum 1200 watt power
supply for a pretty significant discount
so again guys if you want to check out
that deal or anything else on master
opcom check out the link in the video
description and as always like the video
if you liked it dislike it if you just
like to leave a comment if your feelings
are more complicated than all of that
also linked in the video description is
a link to our forum where you can
discuss the video with the more
civilized side of the internet a place
where you can buy cool Linus tech tips
t-shirts not like this one this one's
kind of vintage you know it's like the
classic line is tected t-shirt but we
have other Linus tech tips t-shirts
there and the place where you can change
your Amazon bookmarked one with our
affiliate code so we get a small
kickback whenever you buy defying
s's on Amazon or whatever else the case
may be
thanks again for watching and as always
don't forget to subscribe that you guys
thought I was going to drop it didn't
you that wasn't going to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
