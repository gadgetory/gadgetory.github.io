this is the upgraded configuration
featuring Sandy Bridge it is pre
overclocked so I want to show you guys
what it looks like when it's off of the
high speed pc tech station test platform
and into the fractal design define r3
white arctic white rather case so here
there's one thing i missed in my
unboxing of the arctic white define r3
and that's that the LED here has been
changed from blue to red so there's
something to show you guys here I have
still an empty fan spot you can populate
that in your system if you want but then
I have one fan that's fitting in there
we've got a DVD multi-drive in the front
we've got a whole bunch of stuff running
over here which I'll get to in just a
moment but i just want to show you guys
how all of the hardware packs into this
case for optimal hardware our packing so
here we've got the MS ip67 a GD 53 at
the core of our system so that support
sandy bridge processor supports up to 16
gigs of ddr3 dual channel memory so here
we've got a kit of ddr3 1333 from
g.skill alright we've got a gtx 560
graphics card so this is the performance
package which means that oh this is the
performance package so I think yeah the
1600 had already been tested and i
believe the 1600 sq was pulled out in
order to validate the ddr3 1333 skew
with the auto overclocking feature of
the MSI motherboard so you can see here
that OC genie is enabled and so that
means that our CPU is actually not
running at the default clock speed of
3.4 gigahertz i believe it is and it is
instead running at 4.2 gigahertz and
cooled by the kulit eco alc water
cooling system so right here the eco
actually has rotating fittings here so
no matter what your system is going to
not have any undue stress on the water
cooling hosing you do not ever have to
maintain the cool it eco because it's
pre sealed pre-configured pre everything
so you don't have to worry about any of
that one of the things I want to show
you guys is we do have the Eco setup for
exhaust so you could actually
potentially get even better temperatures
by configuring your vest of 350 with
dual exhaust fans in the top and then an
intake fan at the back instead of an
exhaust because that way you could be
using fresh air instead of heated air in
order to cool your CPU now one of the
other things we've got here is a
seasonic 620 wat 80 plus bronze power
supply although as you'll see with our
power meter here the absolute max power
draw we were able to achieve with this
system was 363 wats from the wall so
really that's about three hundred and
twenty watts probably less than that
probably about 315 wats plate being
pulled from the power supply and that
was running small fft s on the cpu for
maximum power draw on the cpu as well as
3dmark11 on the graphics card
simultaneously so the 620 watt power
supply is totally overkill it's never
going to ramp up in terms of fan speed
always going to run nice and cool and
quiet so we've got an ocz vertex to 120
gig SSD for our boot drive here and then
for our storage drive we have a one
terabyte drive from I believe its
western digital green series Drive you
can add as many as you know eight SSDs
or storage drives should you so desire
and that would be a pretty extreme
configuration so let's turn our
attention to the screen here where we
are running our prime95 test on all
eight virtual course of the 2600 k
processor you can see here our 2600 k is
clocked at 4.19 gigahertz using OC genie
and that also enables any XMP profiles
that are present on the memory so in
this case we're running the 1333 memory
right now so there are no XMP profiles
but if you did configure it with XMP
profile memory it would enable that and
you'd get the tighter XMP timings so I
think that's pretty much everything to
say about that oh here's our temps right
so cpu temps the maximum we've seen is
about 70 degrees so that is pretty darn
impressive
actually considering that this is a
silence optimized chassis and not
necessarily an airflow optimized chassis
and that is while running 3d benchmarks
as well as CPU benchmarks Oh what's this
why did he move it okay it looks like
the highest we've seen is about 75 still
not bad still within reason especially
considering that in a real world load
environment you are never going to
stress your CPU as much as eight threads
of prime95 at the same time plus a bunch
of heat from the graphics card causing
it to be warmer inside and all that
stuff so you can see our CPU usage is
pinned at a hundred percent we've done
our full overnight test with the ddr3
1600 mah modules which I've borrowed on
another platform to test something else
and then it's going to run again
overnight on the 1333 modules and then
we are ready to launch this system and
it will be available to the public
because it will be fully validated don't
forget you can also buy the basic
platform which has a 2500 k a gtx 460 a
lower end power supply and it does not
have an SSD for the boot drive and it
has the 1333 ram and i think those are
all the changes and that one is
available for our lower price as well
actually crazy Russian wanted me to show
you one more thing so I'm just going to
ok here come around to the back so you
can hear how how loud the system is
under load so still not very loud
especially with the silent a/c and the
fact that we have the mic position
directly behind the case with your ears
will never be but I'm going to turn off
prime95
and you're going to hear that ramp right
down so when you are not taxing the
system to the max this thing is so quiet
very very impressive don't forget to
