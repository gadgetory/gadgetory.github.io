for more details welcome to my unboxing
and overview of the BitFenix prodigy M
now if you've already heard of the
prodigy then I won't need to explain to
you what it is it is an MIT X case that
is pretty stylish has support for lots
of radiators and a generally
high-performance hardware in a
relatively small form-factor
now the prodigy M was bit Phoenix's
response to long as I guess sometimes a
criticism of the prodigy which was that
for an ITX case that is a single
expansion slot motherboard case um it
really wasn't that small and bit peanuts
sentiment well yeah but you can put a
lot of other hardware in there like you
know radiators and the lacked on a
harddrive and all that kind of cool
stuff and users will know we want
something that's the size of the prodigy
that we can put an M ATX case and that
is one with four expansion slots and
that my friends is what we have here
today this is the prodigy M which from
the outside looks basically the same as
the original prodigy so here on the
front of the case you've got a nice open
airflow grill so you're going to be able
to bring in fresh air you've got a five
and a quarter inch drive bay right here
you've got the sort of Mac Pro s looking
handles on the top that are made of what
they call fiber flex or something along
those lines which is basically BitFenix
this way of saying they're supposed to
be flexible because a lot of people
complained in the past about them bowing
a little bit so I'm like well that's
that's by design on the side we've got
power reset headphone microphone jacks
as well as two USB 3.0 ports the finish
it actually varies a fair bit so on the
side panel here we've got a
powder-coated black so that's a bit of a
matte black actually looks quite nice
it's got a bit of a shine to it then the
plastic parts on the top use their soft
touch feel so that's a soft touch
plastic and then the grilles themselves
use a bit of a shinier paint finish
on them compared to the rest of it at
the back I yes this is where we find the
differences so we've got a 120 or 140
millimeter fan mount your i/o a little
bit of extra ventilation here tool this
removal of the PCI Express covers so you
just go ahead and undo this thumb screw
right here lift the whole thing up
they're all going to come free so I
don't really want to do that because
it's really really easy to do that all
right so this magnetic guy right here on
the bottom is actually a heat shield
which is I guess okay so when you look
at the bottom you find the first hint as
to the unusual layout so there's your
power supply in the front of the case on
the bottom there's also mounting points
for fans down here as well as anti
vibration mounting points for three and
a half inch hard drives so I guess the
idea is if you fill the bottom with
drives and you don't need those
ventilation holes and you don't want the
heat being exhausted by your power
supply to to get your hard drives hot
you might want to put this on I suspect
in practice it's not going to make that
much of a difference but hey you've got
the option should you desire it you
might have noticed we switched to a
white prodigy M case don't worry we have
we have not done anything crazy voodoo
magic wise we just happen to have a
black one and a white one the last thing
left over from the original prodigy up
here is the removable fan filter slash
grille on the top that allows you to
have access to the I yes up to 240
millimeter slim radiator that can be
installed on the top however it should
be noted that that might interfere with
some of your expandability and once you
get it open and that will become more
apparent so we're going to open up the
side that has the i/o on it
Brandon actually asked me while we were
unboxing it why the i/o is on the side
and the answer is because on the
original prodigy design the entire front
of the case was taken up by the five and
a quarter inch bay and ventilation so oh
yeah that's speaking of ventilation the
white design just like on the original
prodigy doesn't have the vent holes
whereas the black one does so because
it's all taken up by ventilation the i/o
is moved to the side and because the
prodigy M is based very closely on the
original prodigy and it wasn't a
complete redesign from the ground up
well they reused that side placed I oh
so anyway because it reuses most of the
design of the original prodigy they
weren't going to retool it for the IO to
not be on the side because some people
actually like it so here on the side
panel you see a couple of two and a half
inch SSD mounts that you can actually
mount to these plastic ventilated grills
right here and other than that that
basically just comes off like that now
now we see this is not the same case at
all
so the original prodigy had the power
supply mounted in the back the prodigy M
has the power come in the back but that
is using an extension cable so you can
see right here it's wired up internally
that runs to the power supply position
here in the front of the case so this
will actually plug in directly to the
power supply down here which will sit up
here in the front also the motherboard
tray which was horizontal in the
original prodigy has now been adjusted
to be vertical so the motherboard is
actually mounted here in an inverted
position giving you five PCI expansion
slots assuming that you don't use any of
these are rather this 120 millimeter fan
mount over here which gives you a lot of
flexibility because some M ATX cases
even though they only have four slots by
design
some of them put their second PCIe 8x
slot at the very bottom meaning that if
you have two dual slot graphics cards in
SLI or crossfire
having an extra external slot like this
allows you to install an additional card
such as a sound card in between them so
I give BitFenix a lot of credit for
thinking of that then if you don't use
it then you don't use it great install a
fan there and don't worry about it
alright so included as well we've got
two BitFenix 120 millimeter fans so one
in the bottom down here meaning you're
probably gonna want to pull that heat
shield out in the default configuration
and one over here the case supports a
total of four three and a quart of three
and a half inch drives or five two and a
half inch drives and you can play around
a fair bit with where they go so you can
see there are Drive mounts here with the
rubber vibration mount our anti
vibration mounts being for three and a
half inch and these little hooks as well
as these other ones over here being for
two and a half inch drives as well as
here we go we've gotten
accessory box you can also support up to
a 120 millimeter single radiator in the
back of the case so that gives you a
fair bit of liquid cooling flexibility
old well not too nearly the same degree
as the original prodigy because the
motherboard wasn't taking up that much
space in the original prodigy which is
part of why you weren't able to fit that
much hardware in it from a motherboard
and graphics card perspective but you
could do lots of liquid cooling stuff so
there's a USB to 2 USB three adopted
here so that allows you to take the USB
3 ports plug them into USB 2 board and
have them run in USB 2 mode as well as
all the little hardware's
that you're going to need to install
your system inside the case we're going
to do the thumb screws on the other side
which will give us an even better look
at the interior cable management is much
better in the prodigy M compared to the
original prodigy which tended to be a
bit of a challenge although because they
never released a windowed version of it
I guess it was just mostly for the OCD
folks like myself who even cared the
build quality is still very solid I mean
the prodigy is not a cheaply you know
flimsy side panel built case which is
great and carries on here we also see it
has an extremely large motherboard
cutout so you're going to have no
difficulty installing or uninstalling
back plate mounted CPU coolers mat
without taking out your motherboard this
also gives you another look at the front
here so you can see that the front fan
options have not necessarily been
reduced on paper because you still got
all these mounting holes but remember
guys there's a power supply here so yeah
that's that's that's not an option as
much as it was before
I would probably install the power
supply pulling air through the front
particularly if you get the black
version of the case which as I mentioned
before has more ventilation due to those
grills in the front so just like the
prodigy it's available in a variety of
colors it's M ATX instead of ITX
supports fewer drives but more expansion
cards and basically it comes down to you
what you want to go with if you want the
most powerful small form-factor build m
ATX is the way to go because it allows
you to get a rampage for gene throw
something like a 30 or a 49 30 k or 49
60 X 6 core in there and have a very
very powerful little box
