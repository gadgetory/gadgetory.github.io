the Kingston MobileLite Wireless is a
multi-purpose device it's a wireless
video streamer so it's designed to
stream to portable devices like phones
and tablets it is a wireless card reader
so it has an SD card reader as well as a
wireless USB reader for aforementioned
mobile devices and finally it is a
backup battery although I really feel
the first two are the ones where it
really shows its strength whereas that
third one it's not a strong point for it
it has an 1850 milliamp hour battery for
both itself or its own functionality and
to charge an attached device so it's
more like something you'd use an
emergency as opposed to something where
you'd have your phone tethered to it
while you wirelessly stream something to
yourself and expect to sit and watch
movies like that overall the device is a
little bit on the larger side than I
would have liked it but it still feels
quite light and whether that to you is
more like it like an oh it feels kind of
cheap or whether you prefer to have
things be lightweight III like it when
things have a little bit of heft to them
but the good news is that my initial
impression of how it feels kind of light
and inexpensive was correct it is
relatively inexpensive for 50 bucks
kingston is giving you a platform with
which to use your own storage in order
to stream things wirelessly as opposed
to most of the devices like this on the
market that includes storage and are
therefore much more expensive so you can
just use existing USB drives and SD
cards that you have lying around which
is definitely a plus also my experience
continued to be positive once I fired up
the app download so you can see I've got
it running on a variety of platforms
here everything from an iOS tablet down
to a couple of Android smartphones and
the ratings of the app in addition to my
experience seemed to reinforce that
overall it's pretty darn good it doesn't
have a lot of functionality and many of
the mediocre ratings for the app are
less to do with it didn't work it sucks
and more to do with here's some great
stuff Kingston could add in order to
make it better which i think is is
actually a very positive indicator of
the direction that they're going with
its stability first and then trying to
add more features a lot of these
Wireless streamers just flat out don't
we
very well the easy set-up guide within
the app is a little bit verbose it's a
little bit text heavy not as visual as
I'd like but it covers all the basic
stuff like connecting to the MobileLite
Wireless through Wi-Fi how to secure the
connection and then how to set up
internet pass-through so the all three
of these devices have internet
connections and they're streaming 1080p
media from this thing at the same time
the app could definitely be prettier
particularly on the Android side but the
functionality is rock-solid and I didn't
have to waste any time fighting with it
to get it to work so I think this is
actually the first time that I've seen
an app that really feels more mature and
more solid on Android than it does on
iOS and a kudos to Kingston for spending
the time on the dominant plat what is
now the dominant platform to make it
actually work correctly so often I see
the iOS app is awesome and the Android
one is kind of like Frankenstein's
together and even seeing both of them at
parity is not as common as I'd like but
in this case I really felt the Android
one was quite strong even though the iOS
one did look a little bit better I mean
to be clear guys the iOS app is fine
it's functional but it doesn't have the
same the same number of features and
part of this is is just iOS has Fault in
the first place so for example the
ability to directly copy files back and
forth wherever you need within the
directory structure on the device is
something that the Android app can do
but the iOS one can't and something that
I wouldn't mind seeing added to the iOS
one is the ability to use a third-party
player so on the Android one I can use
just the included player I can use BS
player I can use whatever I want so that
I get great file compatibility whereas
on the iOS one it basically just isn't
even detecting the media file types that
it's done that it doesn't support so
that was that was a bit of an issue for
me with the iOS one I did test with up
to three devices streaming 1080p but
these are reasonably low bitrate files
like they're not like crazy uncompressed
or anything like that and there were no
issues at a range that I'd consider to
be reasonable so anywhere within sort of
10 or 15 feet typically this is
something I'd use for traveling in the
car on a plane or something like that so
you wouldn't be tremendously far away
from it one cool thing is that it does
allow both the USB port and the SD card
slot to be used
at the same time so you can pack some
serious storage punch if you want to all
you do is use the app to select which
one you're interested in browsing and
you can browse the local storage on the
device or built within the app on the
iOS version as well
Kingston does have a one terabyte USB
drive and then you could throw up to a
256 gig SD card in there for a massive
amount of storage in fact I've even seen
people using them with USB hard drives
if you have a pigtailed connector and
then you use another USB connector for
power and plug that into a portable
battery bank or something like that so
there's a ton of flexibility here and I
think overall my takeaway from this
review is that it's great to see how
much these devices have matured since
the early attempts like the expensive
and unsuccessful Y Drive
they still don't really make any sense
at home since there are much better
solutions like air video and Amit for
streaming when you have anytime you have
a data connection like from your home PC
across Wi-Fi or even on someone else's
Wi-Fi but for traveling particularly on
planes these things are a godsend the
MobileLite definitely gets a green light
from me at under 50 bucks and I think it
is a very very smart buy I guess I
didn't really talk about it physically
much so it's got a USB charging port to
charge the internal battery a USB port
for the USB you know drive and then it
has an SD card slot I guess there's not
really a whole lot to say power button
so you hold that to turn it on thank you
