course by deep brand check out their new
prism and grip cases super productive at
the link below if you're one of those
people who is just totally sick of this
trend of having bezel this displays with
big notches cut over the top of them
then why not go the absolute opposite
direction and get a flip phone again
this is the Cosmo communicator by a
company called planet computers and it
is frankly an absolute brick but hear me
out you've got dual displays one on the
outside and another one on the inside
accompanied by a full QWERTY keyboard
with actual keys typing like this is a
little difficult for my hands to reach
to the middle but it is doable but if
you set it down on the table and if you
use just one finger on each hand you can
actually get pretty good and we're way
beyond phone territory and getting
closer into laptop category so the
difference between the Gemini and the
communicator which is the upcoming one
is this outer screen so what you've got
here is your standard Android fare when
it comes to notifications it's an OLED
screen notifications come by in either
portrait or landscape mode it does
rotate unfortunately this is just a demo
so it's not responsive to me and I can't
actually interact with it but you can
see it's full color maybe it's a battery
drain but you do have a four thousand
two hundred and twenty milliamp hour
battery on this puppy which I would
expect about three hundred grams
I would hope it has good battery life
opening it up you do have a six inch
display which is I guess always going to
be in landscape mode it has a camera
that's kind of cut out you can't really
call that one of those cut away hole
punch cameras because it is in the bezel
and these puzzles are pretty big and I
don't know if you can have a
determination on this but to me it kind
of looks like the screen isn't exactly
Center it kind of looks like it's a
maybe closer to this side than that side
which kind of irks me but this is really
interesting to me because on the one
hand you've got full mobile phones very
small phones like my pixel three and
then on the other hand you've got
workstations somewhere in the middle of
this year we're gonna be seeing these
Snapdragon equipped LTE laptops that run
Windows and now you've got just closer
to the phone and in spectrum things like
this where I couldn't I can plop this
down on a table when I'm on the train
have a full keyboard experience another
cool thing about it in closed mode is
that you do have your fingerprint sensor
here which you unlock like this but it
actually doesn't matter which
orientation you use it because each one
of these is a speaker and microphone
combined so you can answer it in any
orientation you want once it's open your
speakers are on the sides and they are
stereo speakers something that's really
interesting about this phone is that it
has not one but two USB C ports so what
you can do is maybe be charging your
phone and using a USB C Mouse at the
same time or even having a display out
using HDMI via a USB see specs wise
we're looking at six gigabytes of RAM at
a mediatek P 70 processor which is an 8
core processor at 2 gigahertz each per
core which is a photo 50% faster than
the old Gemini model from last year
which had 10 cores but some of them were
a lot slower storage wise this is a 128
gigabyte device but it does have
expandable storage via micro SD card so
if you're looking for a full flip phone
that has a complete keyboard that
actually is backlit and runs Android 9
and the Cosmo communicator might be your
next phone and of course thank you again
to Dee brand the world's creepiest phone
case is 65 percent thinner than the
first generation under 2 millimeters
thin it's Linus proof it has what they
actually wrote this it has Linus proof
impact protection it's a full-body case
with easy to customize backplate with
one a deep breath signature skins like
always it has extra clicky buttons and
super precise cutouts around all the
cameras and fingerprint sensors it's
available for flagship iPhone Samsung
pixel and oneplus phones and it is
available now for all flagship phones
whether their iPhone Samsung's pixels or
for oneplus also on offer is the D brand
Prizm
unlike most plastic impact resistant
screen protectors this puppy is coated
with a nano layer of glass give you an
OEM feel and as a revolutionary new
installation process making Bosch screen
protectors a thing of the past check it
out at the link below so thanks for
watching guys this is just the beginning
of our CES 2019 coverage so stay tuned
we're here all week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
