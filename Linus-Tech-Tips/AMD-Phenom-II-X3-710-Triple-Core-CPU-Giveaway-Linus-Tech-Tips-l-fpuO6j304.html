this is gonna be the stupidest contest I
have ever hosted on my site now there
are a few rules first of all you cannot
post a comment more than once under this
video if you do you're disqualified
second rule you have to be subscribed to
both Linus tech tips as well as NCI XCOM
YouTube channels okay number three um
let me think I think that's pretty much
it okay so first why don't we find out
what is inside this bin you can see
there's some post-it notes down there
under the little container okay so
here's what we find inside this is an
AMD phenom 2 and I don't remember the
model number and for some reason I can't
get the camera to focus yes it is a
phenom 2 X 3 710 so that is an AM 3
processor supporting ddr2 or ddr3 RAM it
is a triple core and there is potential
although I have not tested this chip
there is potential that it will actually
run as a quad core if you have an
unlocking motherboard so the contest is
to leave a comment under the video that
says what number your comment is under
the video so I have written a number on
the post-it note and go ahead leave a
comment you better do it now because
otherwise you'll have no way to know if
you won or not and then later on in this
video I am going to reveal what number
is written on the top piece of paper on
that sticky note and whoever leaves that
number comment and and and the comment
has to be in the format of like like
this ok so it has to be like you know
when people are all like you know first
ok it has to be like that but I can tell
you now it's a two digit number so
definitely try unless there's already
like several hundred hundred comments on
this video and I know you might be
saying I shouldn't encourage these guys
but I kind of think it's funny so I'll
do whatever I want because it's my
youtube channel
hey here we go whoever posts 42nd and
has to post 42nd wins
so you win a fennan 2x3 actually I don't
know if it's a finem - whatever it's an
Benham 710 is it fit him to holding
whatever it's a triple core processor
that's pretty good prize yeah it's a
finem to 42nd and if you don't do it
right then I'll find some other way to
give this away and you lose so you
should have listened carefully to the
instructions don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips for more chances to
win awesome prizes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
