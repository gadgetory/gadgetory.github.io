focus on budget parts for a change
something we can afford we've heard your
cries fact here at Linus Media Group we
take your concerns very seriously so
here it is my friends the build on the
tightest budget yet BASC now in the
glory of the $69 gaming PC
the be quiet pure bass 600 features a
versatile design noise insulation and
optimization for different liquid cooled
radiator configurations
learn more at the link below okay so I
guess before moving forward we should
give credit or rather absolve ourselves
of credit for this build where credit is
due a little while ago while perusing
the pcmasterrace subreddit we stumbled
across a thread where a user wanted to
build a gaming pc for under $100 and
anonymous really came through for him or
her specking out probably one of the
most astonishing pcs we've ever seen for
a mere 69 US dollars disclaimer if you
actually need to build a gaming PC for
under $100 it is possible get an old
Vell optiplex or something in through a
used video card in it I can guarantee
that'll be a better experience than what
we're about to make but come on maybe
that's been done a thousand times on
YouTube already and we were far more
interested in finding out just what kind
of gaming experience could be had for
exactly $69 so then the backbone of any
PC is the power supply which is why we
recommend the incredible Diablo tech at
da series 250 watt to always be in close
proximity to one of these Ram we've got
covered by this one gig stick of
kingston ddr2 running at a rapid 667
million Hertz this will occupy all of
the one memory slots in our via VV 7000
won which by the way is still more
memory slots than a razorblade 2017 now
for our motherboard we did end up with a
slightly different one than the original
post but it has the same basic features
and most importantly processor the via
c7 is the heart of our build a small
low-power single-core CPU from 2007
running at a whopping 1.5 gigahertz with
via yuna chrome onboard graphics with
support for the latest DirectX API if by
latest you mean dx8 even at the time
this was far from a powerful solution
and ten years later it hasn't exactly
aged like fine wine so let's get this
party started shall we
we started with planning building up the
machine in the only case we could afford
so the cardboard box that the
motherboard shipped in and installing
our operating system on the only boot
drive we could afford a USB boot drive
but we were quickly foiled by trash
Windows XP booting support so we moved
on to plan B Puppy Linux only one small
problem with that we couldn't even get
the machine to post with the single
sided stick of memory that we got for
the build so fortunately this dank AF
ocz gold xt c memory that we had lying
around to the rescue but then more
problems steam wouldn't run due to
minimum requirements issues on Linux
so we caved grabbed a hard drive and a
CD drive off the shelf and
began to install windows only to have
disaster strike all of this excitement
was actually too much for the venerable
c7 on our original board and during the
Windows XP install the poor thing died
never to post again so a month later we
have our second board from China that
quite frankly looks a fair bit rougher
and the fact that it came without a CMOS
battery didn't lend much credence to the
tested working claims but who knows
maybe we'll get lucky today
this time we aren't taking any chances
with the Windows install so we
completely broke the price limit and
connected the whole thing to an SSD in
order to speed up the process where did
you find ps2 keyboard and lights plug
this in
flip the switch you want to do the
honors yeah there we go all right it's
alone there it is
we got the post screen let's keep this
right here between us that way it's a
equidistant either of us can grab it
easily all that beautiful Windows XP
boot screen okay
Wow what the hell is this
are you really young enough that you
don't even know how to change the
position to at least I mean if you're
gonna make it scary you gotta make it
full scary what game first should we
start with the synthetic benchmark no
that's probably good for last because it
might break it cool
Rainbow six maybe Rainbow six oh wow I
went to just start typing Rainbow six I
forgot how the old start menu worked now
my friends this isn't Rainbow Six Vegas
or Rainbow six some other suffix this is
Rainbow six oh gee wow look at that
cutscene it's beautiful wow those
graphics wow that fan manages to be
pretty loud yeah I think the bearings
are bad on this one
because it didn't sound like that on the
other one that's actually running not
bad I mean all things considered
look at those animations it's beautiful
the whole rainbow 6 concept just didn't
make a ton of sense to me like the idea
of relying on AI which is inherently
garbage to complete the mission rather
than being a super soldier it's just
crash
oh you just suck okay this games no fun
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater for no I know
that one doesn't open okay that Tony
Hawk's Pro Skater two words alright
do you remember game demos we're running
demos it'd be so good for our job too
it's like then we wouldn't have to buy
games to benchmark them oh wow this
actually running okay this is legit
running pretty smoothly I mean that
doesn't help me much
I even got like some blood effects when
I fell down there he's a really good
skater if he can take these directions
we're playing out Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
- yes that was my child okay how do you
play this game I think I did it on
console okay okay whoa you did a 360 no
comply
oh you lost all the boys so V does
something how do I get up speed it keeps
beeping whenever you press a key if I
press too many Stan's do a thing and
jump out of it oh yeah oh yeah landed it
Terran was good at a video game yeah
what the hell just happened okay what's
next you installed tf2 on this yeah I
could've told you that wasn't gonna
happen well it has a DirectX 8 mode
though so I was hopeful ah well let's
find out if lake 3 Arena will run all
right oh okay
now this okay what res do you think we
can run at 800 by 600 she would go for
it might as well push to them like max
at first well I mean okay here we go
yeah no I'm not gonna go I'm not gonna
go any further than that okay here we go
here we go
hey that's running not bad oh damn it
what go away go right no I haven't even
noticed to kill him ones yet
oh I'm almost dead damn it if I had any
shame whatsoever this would be really
humiliating
okay let's fire up 3dmark 2001 se
benchmark yep all right
in one car slow detail ok 1413 fps okay
so quantitatively this is not the best
experience you can have with a gaming PC
not even under $100 but was it a blast
finding a three-year-old reddit post
that someone obviously created kind of
tongue-in-cheek to make fun of someone
for not having a big enough budget and
recreate it and bring it to life yeah
for sure but like it's so bad that it's
almost good again everything that
doesn't run on it just crashes
immediately yeah everything that does
run on it is fun to do so there you have
it $69 gaming PC right there boom you
saw it here first and last skill share
is an online learning community for
