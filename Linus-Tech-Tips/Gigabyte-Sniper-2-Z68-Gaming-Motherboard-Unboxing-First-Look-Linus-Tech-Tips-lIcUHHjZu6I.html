exclusive unboxing this is the gigabyte
g1 snipers actually I think that's a to
the g1 sniper to I actually have not
only the sniper do but also the sniper
one so we can compare them against each
other but let's go over what is similar
about them before we even get started
here so number one they're both made by
gigabyte number two they both have a
three year warranty in the u.s. in
Canada number three four five I lost
track okay they're also both part of the
g1 gaming series of motherboards from
gigabyte which means these are decked
out to the nines with all the gear you
need for gaming we also have x5 extreme
fidelity sound on both of these boards
killer a 2100 gaming networking built
into both of these boards and support
for fast Intel processors built into
both of these boards however they are
different the g1 sniper used the Intel
x58 platform in 1366 CPUs the g1 sniper
2 uses the z68 platform and Intel second
generation Core i7 Core i5 and core i3
CPUs so that means it does support Sandy
Bridge processors and they have also
built in support for upcoming until 22
nanometers processors which are
codenamed Ivy Bridge so you are going to
be buying a fairly future-proof
motherboard with the sniper - last but
not least it is ready for native PCI
Express gen3 that is double the
bandwidth or quadruple the bandwidth of
PCI Express 2.0 and 1.0 respectively
very cool so that means even if you're
running to a sli with dual 8 X PCI
Express 3.0 graphics cards that will be
the same bandwidth that used to be
available to motherboards that we're
running dual SLI in dual 16x pcie 2.0
slots so there's something to consider
because it does support Sandy Bridge we
do have full support for Intel SRT
technology so that's where you take your
SSD you use it as a cache for your hard
drive and you can run up to four times
faster in a real-world scenario honestly
it baffles me that more people aren't
using SRT because it really does work
it's very very cool
let's go ahead and start taking this box
apart here and we'll do our typical
unboxing and then I'm gonna do a bit of
a comparison between the sniper two and
the sniper one I'll take that one out as
well we'll have a quick look at it so
here's the sniper two comes in a nice
matte black box to match that gorgeous
matte black PCV and let's look at what
we've got in terms of accessories we
have the gigabyte g1 series poster which
I have seen a couple of times included
with g1 series boards with the original
assassin sniper and guerrilla characters
on the front as well as a target with
pre bullet hold pulse on it for you on
the back next we have some stickers
including more bullet holes a skull of
some bullets more bullets and vocals an
excellent stuff finally we have a
gigabyte sticker not finally there's
still more actually this is a very rich
accessory package user's manual
including some notes PCI Express 16x
slots are compatible with next
generation until 22 nanometer CPUs and
support the PCI Express 3.0 standard
very cool driver disk throw that away
download the latest from the gigabyte
website Smart Response technology
installation guide gigabyte actually has
a much better much smarter way to
install this just download the little
utility off their website it's awesome
it's so easy I couldn't even believe it
alright next we've got four SATA cables
remember those are going to be
compatible with SATA 2 or SATA 3 doesn't
really matter and a DVI to HDMI adapter
remember those are signal compatible so
it doesn't really matter if you use an
adapter there is no signal degradation
we have an i/o shield a black flexible
SLI bridge nice touch I hate seeing
those ugly Brown SLI bridges including
on included on high-end boards because
it just makes your build look terrible
oh this is nice look at this okay so
gigabyte includes quick boost so I'm
guessing that's a one tattoo
overclocking button esata/usb combo port
and then two USB 3.0 ports and a five
and a quarter inch bay adapter piece
very nice because a lot of case
still don't support usb3 so you can add
that to your existing case while you
wait to upgrade it or whatever the case
may be
very nice and here it is this night go
to their g1 series boards just looks so
good
like they just look so good gigabyte
used to be kind of in my eyes a bit of a
joke in terms of their aesthetic but
they've just turned that completely
around with this with the g1 series
boards they've got a very sharp overall
look so we're using a matte black PCB we
have certain shiny components including
the VRMs including the CPU socket we've
got a little bullet sticking out of I
believe you guys were telling you this
is a mag not a clip can't remember for
the life of me anymore we've also got
the barrel of a pistol as part of the
mosfet cooling up here and green lights
here that looked just great if you throw
in something like a GTX 590 which also
has glowing lights on the side looks
just amazing in a gaming bill that's
interesting okay getting get into that
later so why don't we look at the
overall layout of the board first so
first of all we start with the CPU
socket in the middle that is an LGA 1155
socket supporting Intel Sandy Bridge and
even Ivy Bridge CPU so be ready for that
we've got our power delivery up here on
the top left exactly where it belongs
that's an 8 pin a pin savate slot next
we have our CPU fan character here which
is a 4 pin PWM CPU fan connector you can
clearly see the vrm cooling is using a
sort of gun mettle themed gun appearance
themed look it's got heat pipes that are
carrying from the ball from the chipset
up to this side and then it just has a
dedicated non heat piped
off that heats tank up at the top moving
over to the right hand side we have for
ddr3 slots supporting dual channel
operation next we have our 24 pin power
connector along the right-hand edge and
this is something that I just don't see
enough of USB 3 header on the right hand
edge of
the board this is the smartest place for
it I'm just tired of running front panel
connectors way down here to the bottom
when you don't have to they should be
right here because that's where they're
going to be the closest to the front of
your case love it great designs the
decision next we've got to say that's
three connectors running off of a
third-party chipset we have to say -
three connectors running off of the
Intel chipset and then we have three
SATA 2 connectors also running off the
Intel chipset your last Intel SATA 2
connector is likely running off the back
as an eSATA connector alright next we've
got some more if you know what I'll do a
summary of the fan headers at the end so
that you guys can see where they all are
here is the custom header for the OC
button that was on that front panel next
we've got our front panel headers we've
got a clear CMOS jumper we've got front
USB so you see the one with the red
background that means that it supports a
higher current so you can actually
charge things like tablets with the
utility from the gigabyte website off of
those particular ports so make sure you
plug those ones in first you've got a
couple more front USB 2's front panel
audio and in terms of PCIe slot layout
we've got two PCIe 16x slots two PCIe 1x
slots and two PCI slots so that's pretty
good mix if you installed two dual slot
cards you're gonna be covering these
guys those two and those two so that'll
leave you with one PCIe 1x and one PCI
slot now having fewer expansion slots on
a board like this is far less of a
concern because you already have a very
high end hardware sound card check that
out and a very high end hardware NIC
both are already built into the board so
you pretty much don't need to replace
them with anything very very cool
alright actually ok yeah I promised I'd
do you guys the summary of all of these
CPU connectors so our fan connectors
rather we've got one to stay further
back so I can just point out where they
are three four five five yep fan five
and connectors it's a very respectable
amount and they are all PWM so you don't
have to fuss with any sort of linear
voltage adjustments for
changing the RPM of your fans on the
back here we will find one two three
four five six seven eight
USB 2.0 ports that guy's a combo USB 2
eSATA port love these ports so handy
everything should be this flexible and
then two USB 3.0 ports personally I
believe that's enough especially if you
already have two in the front
since most things that I'm using USB 3
for these days are just storage anyway
which I'm plugging and unplugging fairly
frequently we've got our own C button on
the back alright that should be pretty
self-explanatory
OCS next we have a ps2 USB ps2 keyboard
mouse combo port and HDMI output more on
that in just a second and then we have
Gigabit Ethernet and finally 7.1 audio
with optical audio out so this is a
feature that I didn't mention before
this is Intel Quick Sync so what you can
do is you can use that HDMI port you can
use your HDMI to DVI adapter put it in
like that and you can actually take
advantage of the onboard graphics card
built into the Intel CPU to transcode
video even when you're running a
dedicated graphics card there is a
slight performance decrease but I would
say for the incredible boost you get in
transcoding performance especially if
you have a tablet or a smartphone you
want to switch your videos over to a
compatible format it is an enormous
advantage to the Intel z68 platform so
