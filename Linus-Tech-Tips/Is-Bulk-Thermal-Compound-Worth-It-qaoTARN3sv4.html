thermal transfer between the hot pieces
of silicon in our computers and the
hunks of metal that are responsible for
dissipating their heat into the air but
there are so many different solutions
out there ranging from stuff that's
included with your products for free all
the way up to pads that can cost
multiple dollars each for single-use
applications not to mention that even
with the tubes they're so small that you
have to be frequently reordering them
paying for shipping on these things is
inordinately expensive but maybe there's
another way what if you could order in
bulk one time enough thermal paste to
last you for the rest of your life well
I've certainly tried
synergy is the software that lets you
share your mouse and keyboard between
multiple computers check it out at the
link in the video description so right
out of the gate my main reason for
buying thermal grease in bulk has been
kicked in the head term of validity two
years so no it will not indeed last you
a lifetime
unfortunately but what else does this
thing have to say for itself there
wasn't a lot of information on the
Amazon page I just kind of ordered it
and went from there but apparently there
are more choices all of which are either
better or looks like better than the one
that I got which is the hy 610 there's
some instructions for how to apply and
sort of features is low thermal
resistance and high thermal conductivity
the same thing isn't that basically the
same thing as heat transfer I mean I
guess if I was charged with writing the
the marketing bullet points for a tub of
thermal goop I probably wouldn't be able
to - much better anyway let's open it up
step one open the film okay we're having
a little bit of difficulty with step one
here laughs what kind of horrible
business fit oh wow it's a really
different color from those civil
compounds that I've used and has really
different packaging and it seems to be
designed to keep you out of it that is
that is pretty exciting okay
Wow it's kind of like a gold color to it
I was expecting it to just be like your
standard white no silicon type step to
mix the oil that has separated from the
rest of the thermal compound who are one
to two minutes that is a long time and
the included stick is really not very
good but this is what royal peanut
butter looks like
okay this is not a very good stir stick
okay mission accomplished I guess new
thermal contents can enhance it gives
you that shiny glow look at that so the
first step in evaluating the value of
buying involved if I have a look at how
much we paid for it so apparently it's
not available right now but apparently
we paid 90 bucks for it and you get an
entire kilogram of their thermal grease
compound silicon for CPU VGA key thing
so when you compare that to something
like a tube of Arctic alumina 1.75 grams
and you're paying a few bucks for that
so if you were paying the same rate for
something like icy diamonds again this
is uh 24 carats whatever that is in a
real measurement okay and they don't
even mistake brilliant well whatever the
point is that this buying like this is
much much more expensive oh my god oh
crap I got thermal compound
okay that's fine because that leads me
into the second important thing when
we're evaluating value we've got to look
at performance so in order to do that
we're going to need some paper towel
we're going to need some rubbing alcohol
and we are going to need a computer
which I conveniently have right here and
we will get to that in a moment
after I'm done cleaning my laptop so
here's how we're doing the test I see
diamond isn't the best thermal compound
on the market but it's right up there
it's a high-performance thermal compound
and if this stuff gets us anywhere near
that then it looks like a much better
deal so on the test bench behind me
I've been running on a cluemaster AIO
with a 59 60 X about an hour and 20
minutes of eye distress tests with just
the stress ftu box checked and our CPU
temps are sitting at 58 to 59 degrees I
would consider either of those to be a
tie when we're done this so all that's
left to do now is shut this puppy down
replace the thermal compound that's on
here with our value special hy 600
thermal grease fire it back up wait for
it to reach equilibrium and have a look
at the results that's a very good
application of the icy diamond that was
on there that's actually really good for
us to know
okay so we'll use this petula method
apply here I guess oh crap I got it okay
you know what this is actually kind of
hard Brenda I don't look for this
applicator is not optimal okay and it is
already crappier so this stuff sucks 64
degrees that is a full 6 degrees higher
than a high quality thermal compound
meaning that I just spent $90 on some
really crappy thermal paste not
recommended
do you use Amazon what we do and we
think they're great I personally have
two Amazon Prime accounts that's right
one is not enough for me I have one for
Amazon Canada and one for the US what's
Prime you might ask and I might respond
really you've never heard of Prime okay
it cost 99 US dollars annually gives you
access to a ton of cool features Prime
now which is in very very limited
regions like free two-hour delivery
they've got their regular free prime
shipping they've got access to prime
video which is unlimited streaming of
movies and TV episodes twitch prime
which gives you exclusive discounts on
physical gains and new releases as well
as what are all of these stupid notes
about the land show blah blah blah
consider subscribing over there and
cetera whatever the point is check it
out at the link below
Amazon Prime also you can just go buy
stuff to have everything so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you can hit that dislike button but if
you liked it hit the like button get
subscribed me to consider checking out
the links in the video description we've
got where to buy the stuff we feature
and by other stuff maybe we'll link that
instead we've got our merch store we've
got our community forum and we've got
other videos which you should definitely
check out I will see you guys again next
