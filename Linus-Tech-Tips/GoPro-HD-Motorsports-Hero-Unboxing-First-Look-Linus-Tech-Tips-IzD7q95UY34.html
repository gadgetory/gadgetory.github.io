the GoPro be a hero motor sports hero
this is a true HD video camera that is
designed with a mounting system that
allows you to mount it to your car or
your motorbike these are the pictures
they have on the front let's go ahead
and have a look at this very fancy box
from the side you've got it mounted on a
dirt bike there it's waterproof to 180
feet okay this is a takes 5 megapixel
photos included mounts are right here
supports suction cup two curved adhesive
mounts three flat adhesive mounts
three-way pivot arm and cables are
included alright ah you know what let's
do this side first four we've got it
mounted on what appears to be a go-kart
then we've got a dirt bike again and
here it is mounted in a car all right on
the back we see the overall specs so in
terms of video we can support up to
1080p at 30fps or 720p at 30 or 60 FPS
light sensitivity video form ok the
video format is h.264 and it also
supports mp4 file format cool all right
mono audio so it does capture audio it
has a 5 megapixel resolution ok for
photos that's good storage is done by a
SD card up to a 32 gig Max and average
record times are here so if you're
recording at wow looks like you actually
don't get much additional recording time
for stepping down from 1080p to 720p so
12 minutes at 1080p with per gig and 16
minutes per gig at 720p ok USB 2 is
included and it has a battery that runs
for approximately two point two five
hours per recording supports OSX as well
as Windows Vista but I suppose it will
also support windows seven without much
difficulty as well so this was a
complicated box to get open because of
the stickies that are on the side here
but why don't we have a look at the
included accessories and wow we've got
some pretty fancy pants looking cables
here okay so that looks like a component
HD video out ok then we have a composite
video out including audio I don't know
why it has stereo audio connectors
n it only actually supports a mono audio
recording but whatever I'm not gonna not
going to question it there's a USB cable
for transferring your data all right we
got suction cup mount hmm ok so these
can be loosened oh yeah there we go
there we go so you can actually adjust
that a number of different way you go
you press in order to I guess attach it
here let's see yep press to attach and
that one will in theory release it or we
press to release well it comes off ok
next we have some double-sided tape
mount ones ok so there's something if
something else there's other more
different thing no that's the same thing
ok just dump these out here another one
of those mares please and another one so
it looks like these mount by sliding in
here ok so yeah you can clip that guy on
there and then this guy can oh I don't
know how to get it out now there we go
so you can slide out so basically these
allow you to position them in a bunch of
different places where you might be
likely to attach the GoPro at some later
point in time so then there's a couple
different options for mounts that go on
there so there's this one and this one
ok but not least that one ok wow that's
kind of neat it includes all these
different accessories so you can mount
it on a variety of different vehicles
just play by grabbing it and clicking it
on all right here we have Wow all right
I'm just gonna cheat because that's what
I do when I don't know what else to do
ok so here we go two curved adhesive
mounts that's these here you might as
well look at these while i well I talk
about them oh no these must be the two
adhesive mounts yeah they're curves so
that they'll stick to something that is
rounded to that two curved adhesive
mounts ah three flat adhesive mounts
that is these guys right here so these
are flat on the bottom all right we have
three way pivot arm that must be this
guy okay then we have just a bunch of
notes fine okay documentation is all
included with instructions which i will
definitely definitely need at this point
I'm we've got a couple different
languages for instructions hopefully
there's an English one somewhere consult
a consult a consult tis ok that's ok
we'll figure that out later and warranty
so warranty is guaranteed for one year
from the original date of purchase here
we have the battery and now finally
let's extract the GoPro camera unit
itself give me a minute on this one so
here it is extracted it's attached to
the base via the sliding clicking
mechanism that you use to attach it to
either your flat or your curved mounts
here so there you go it can throw it on
one of those like that or we can go
ahead and okay it is a little tough to
remove from those once you've got it on
there there we are alright so let's have
a look at the end of itself so here we
have a button here we have the lens here
we have an LCD screen here we have other
more different button here we have a
latch which appears to assist us in
removing the waterproof cover there we
are and this is where all the magic
happens so there's your microphone there
is your USB there's your TV output
there's your HDTV output this is also
your sound output if you're running HD
TV all right you've got your battery
compartment on the back there there's
your SD slot and
oh yeah here we go here all the
different modes so r 1 is y vga r 2 is
720p at 30fps are 360 FPS 720p r 4 is
960 p @ 30fps and r 5 is there you go
1080p at 30fps so for best sound in high
wind use at less than 100 miles per hour
use the non waterproof door so
presumably that is this one okay and for
greater than 100 miles per hour use the
waterproof door so let's go ahead and
see how complicated it is to install the
battery ha very uncomplicated so we're
just going to whip it this up I mean
instance setback 4a min and check this
out there's so much stuff in this
package I would not have guessed that
one small package could contain so much
HD goodness all right so let me just
make sure I haven't missed anything
critical here in this video it is a
shockproof apparently bomb proof and
waterproof okay it can shoot hands-free
excellent audio recording that removes
unnecessary noise and ambience okay the
camera connectors and cables are
available with pc connection and HDTV
out which we've seen already and then
finally the professional quality full HD
video 1080p 960p in 720p okay so yeah so
we've pretty much covered everything so
we'll have a quick look at the
waterproof casing so you can replace
this backing with the non waterproof one
for better audio capture at low speeds
all right and then you can also remove
this particular mounting system and you
can take the whole thing haha we are and
you can mount it to any of the other
number of arms or other different arms
depending on how you want to attach the
GoPro to your vehicle or helmet or
whatever it is you want to attach it to
to take some cool 1080p HD video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
