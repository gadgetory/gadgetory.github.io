show time so we've got a great show for
you guys today lots of good topics
action every time yeah people died which
sucks because like no I mean that sucks
too but I meant the having great topic
sucks because we burned through a bunch
of time with inexplicable audio issues
because yeah wait what is going on now
what what even is this is this crashed
what is what this oh that's pretty neat
are we even
or even like pictures frozen nice that's
real - ah I've never seen it
real cool go back to main that's working
well don't go back to me yeah click on
camera yeah right click properties
refresh it you have to do it in
properties which is fine
oh no property is available so I think
oh my goodness wait wait hold on hold on
oh yeah I don't know people are just
saying the screen share worked oh man oh
man feels good feels good everything
feels good right about now I love this
no no I got nothing I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna like I'm just gonna add a new
one I'm just gonna add like a new a new
hold on what am I looking for media
source no no I don't want that I want a
new
new new video capture device there it is
okay at existing a vio camera okay yeah
the camera scene not there yep yeah now
dude it there yeah yeah no no no no do
you activate activate forgot that you
had to messed it so that it would keep
its dimensional properties so do we
leave this at this point or do we spend
people's twitch with yet another
notification neither the tough question
this is what you guys don't see behind
the camera we tackle here on the win
show to make the best show alright the
greatest show yeah my friends called me
there I'm kidding I have no friends
nobody calls me my friends called me
they said look you never show up on time
you talk so quiet we can't understand a
damn thing you're saying and every once
in a while we're in the middle of a
conversation and you all right so we've
got a lot of great topics for you guys
today
Apple responds to the iPhone slowdown
fiasco so does I fix it dropping their
iPhone battery replacement prices
they're not a sponsor today - $29 what
else we got so somebody got swatted
which resulted in them dying
yes weddings not funny by the way no and
this was like the person that got
swatted gave a fake address but it was a
real address and then that person that
lived at the fake address died so they
actually had nothing to do with the
entire situation but we'll talk more
about that later
and then someone fell down while playing
games in VR
and hit their head on a table and died
great week yeah stay tuned after the
intro talk about it more
yeah we would we would stream three
times in ten minutes
we would script that like for sure like
the end sponsees fresh books you have to
get the wine just above yeah no I have
it it's above it's just not working
because whatever you probably the
refresh site OBS is not better than
xsplit it never said it was bad it is
better they're both they're both not at
this time glaring issues ladies have
different glaring issues we need to just
yeah we need to combine them yeah except
that then we'd end up with all the glare
if you took the automatic game detection
from xsplit and yet most but not all of
the UI design from x-play yeah and put
it on top of OBS I think audio UI is off
that's what that's why I said most
abominable this audio UI pretty good
adding gain terrible what I want to know
why is it that only VLC can figure this
out okay a volume slider that just goes
to a hundred and fifty percent why is it
DLC had that going on a decade ago and
literally no one else now people are
saying it's quiet except if I laugh it's
really loud yeah that actually just kind
of makes sense because my life is really
loud yeah no not nothing we get nothing
we can do about yeah it's playing
alright yeah well I'm playing recording
suite 2018 at this point you know what
maybe like honestly probably not 2018
but okay I will promise you it is not
going to happen in 2018 I'm also certain
there's people on the team that
would have a hoot trying to make one of
those I'm certain that there's people on
the team who are already working on it
stop
we need to get the site launched okay
it's coming there's some great things
you guys are crazy
they're awesome you guys are crazy oh oh
first topic this week is yeah I know I
know some people get frustrated with
this but there's literally nothing I can
do about it right now
is a floatplane topic because this is
officially Luke's last week Oh as a
linus media group because loyally
unceremonious day ever actually yeah you
got your five year award at the
Christmas dinner it was a silver medal
and I'm not getting a gold one because
he's firing I'm not firing you
yeah I'm being forced to quit by fire so
he was like here's your silver medal
bt-dubs can never get a better one hey
hey you can make your own you can make
your own medals I'm gonna give myself a
Goldman yeah you can make yeah I mean
every floatplane medal will be a gold
medal Yvonne and I talked about it we
were like do we get five-year like
company theoretically you're an employee
of the company because of how it works
you should actually it's strictly
speaking yeah I've been employed by
Linus Media Group Incorporated yeah for
five years but I was like who Awards it
to me who boards it to you I think you
would award it to each other but yeah
yeah come on no I know that's like I
mean the optics of that are like giving
yourself an award essentially I would I
wouldn't do it ceremoniously I would
just put it on a shelf at home you know
what I mean I see I see
so I would want it so that I could have
my own representation of like whatever
right but I'm not gonna like go up to
stage be like I'm such a wonderful
person
congratulations me for sticking it out
for five years we're not quitting myself
yeah yeah for putting up with my
horrible boss for so long
he wants to have meetings on Mondays and
Fridays what a crazy person crazy person
um so no what were we talking about okay
so so right so actually this is a great
time to do a little bit of QA about what
this transition means because I know a
lot of people have been asking so the
first question that we have in the chat
actually I don't see it there but I'm
sure it's coming is Luke are you gonna
be on wedge Hill anymore sorry I have to
interrupt for one second somebody said I
don't think the CEO gets any metals
works for me still get medals at
floatplane
and that means you don't sorry what was
your what was your question are you
still gonna be on when show yeah yeah
I'm gonna be on win show next week I'll
almost certainly be on the web show the
week after that although the week after
that is the wench of when we're at CES
so it's always kind of how it works is
always kind of who knows I'm certain but
there if if I'm not on that one it's
because of like some random reason not
because I don't work for MJ anymore I'm
still gonna be doing LMG stuff I'm still
gonna be managing their security that's
random I'm still gonna be doing wham
show and I'll probably be on a video
here and there we have one that we have
planned to film yeah the year the year
long concludes yeah you can stop
tweeting me about it oh my god we know
just let me it's a low priority yeah I
mean okay because it's like I had some
actor tweet me about it
like they're high-profile enough that
like I got a notification that they
followed me and they followed me
specifically to be like yo when the hell
are you doing that I don't remember who
it was but it was like it was like mr.
actor the conclusion is install filters
where you don't have fans it was like no
it was like someone like significant I
can't remember because I don't really
I'm just saying like if you don't have
time to wait for the thing and you're
trying to build the computer just
install filters where you don't have
fans I don't really know
actor people James Alan McCune I'm super
bad with James in Madi on shameless and
Jimmy on the walking dead Wow
yeah oh no I recognize this guy yeah oh
that's cool
no so Late Late so so so guy tweets me
and he's like yo yo hat line is tech
whatever happened to that year-long PC
airflow experiment you said you were up
to last year I'm like we are going to do
it just been busy I'm gonna be I'm gonna
be that guy ride y'all about it so giddy
up cowboy spell giddy up wrong but
that's okay his skill set is not about
spelling yeah and I'm like okay might
not be until after C yes and he's still
riding me
okay I'll allow it this time looking
forward to it
also oh if y'all need a guesthouse for C
yes I know a guy
whoa cool I didn't even see that get him
man that'd be super cool yeah
CJ's two cents isn't the only youtuber
tech show that can like talk to real
celebrities BAM yeah
it's a really funny thing like how like
like it's weird because we're clearly
like known like you were talking about
going to twitchcon and people being like
yo what up but then like we're will
never be real celebrities internet
celebrities the only way to be real
celebrity is to actually do crossovers
with mainstream media like a pewdiepie
and is featured episode in South Park
for example and you know what's you know
what's kind of weird is I actually think
there might be more obsessive tendencies
for the like not real celebrity yeah
people they're like attainable Sarah
they're attained up there more
attainable
yeah there's less security yep because
there's less money going around they
don't live on like 15 million dollars
some of them live in like an apartment
or some normal house that has no
additional security if you do events you
probably have no security you're you're
much more public in terms of like this
guy's he's in some huge stuff I
recognize him from multiple different
things that happen his Twitter account
is not that big yeah it's the opposite
of someone who's like a youtuber who
will have a giant Twitter account yeah
you know they're less recognizable than
exactly and I'm not I'm not trying to
dig on you dude if you're watching that
wasn't the point like there's lots of
different things and they probably see
you a lot more if someone's in a movie
and they're a big movie star um for like
two hours ish but it's more memorable
it's more memory yeah but yeah I wish
every once in a blue moon youtubers
often really really commonly if they're
a twitch streamer potentially like eight
hours a day like it's way more personal
there's a lot more obsession apparently
he was on sugar pine seven just from
what was in his Twitter bio he's ya know
it's crazy um apparently people prefer
LTT internet celebrity over Kim
Kardashian but we weren't really talking
about Kim Kardashian specifically that's
another weird people are like can we do
a patreon to save Luke that's awkward
know what else someone also asked if
you're gonna be doing last media group
stuff from time to time can you be
retained as a part-time employee that
would be really weird and it'd be
complicated and expensive too so if he's
part-time at both companies then both
companies have to pay like Canada
Pension Plan separately and I don't I
don't remember how benefits works as
well but there's like and it would be
like a really low amount of hours of
part-time and then really randomly it
would be like a bunch and then you'll go
back down a really low like it's it's
actually easier if we just keep it clean
and Lucas just like a guest on the LAN
show or like guest host the video here
and there and he is the CEO of
floatplane media that's his job yeah I
was looking to see you a floatplane
nope nope no technically that's me jokes
but actually this is something that
neither Luke nor I had looked up
beforehand but see oh oh basically means
you actually run the company yeah well I
totally didn't know but yeah if you look
up the actual definition of CEO is more
what did it say it was like it was like
it was like large-scale strategic
decision maker yeah and then CEO was
like operationally speaking actually
runs the damn thing yeah oversight of
operational procedures and efficiencies
it had a really broad description that
was basically like the guy that actually
does the stuff so it actually works
really well in terms of like definition
of what I want to do a floatplane it
makes way more sense so is floatplane a
different building no no it'd be tape on
the floor for now you know yeah someday
though if all goes according to plan it
will need to be flow plane
we needed someone building it'll have
its own it's at its own like quite a few
employees and it'll like totally explode
and we've had a lot of people tell us
floatplane is gonna be a failure like
you know the failing float plane is
already failing my favorite one is when
they spell it wrong yeah these people
have no no access to internal numbers
that already exists and it is not
failing and it's not gonna fail and
we're actually like really excited
because sometime in the next hopefully
we would measure it in weeks not months
we're gonna have an alpha site up well
technically you could go on the site now
if you really wanted to supersize I've
sort of I've said like it's not open in
any way unless you're inquisitive enough
to figure out how to get in there yeah
and then and then hopefully not that
long after that we are gonna get to the
point where we would be able to invite
on more creators I don't know what
you're changing unless it's white
balance he's done it before though he
has done it before
okay we'll defend him on that taryn's
yeah I think he comes in this way with
ripped underwear every time see oh wow
that's what I needed I needed Terran
ripped underwear before my long day so
I'll have lots of time to reflect on
that ah dang oh dang someone asked so
I'll bring it up right now
someone said are you doing your charity
stream after this no that is narrow oh
I'm doing it tomorrow I was like what
well then why did you why did I know
it's yo can i promote the charity stream
on the lan show and I was like yeah go
for it like are you doing it no tomorrow
it starts at noon Pacific Standard Time
why do you waste my time no is this
funny to you well I won't anymore cuz
I'm leaving you can't leave cuz I'm
sending you wait no severance all right
but yeah I know it's starting tomorrow
at noon we've raised 21,000 for extra
life so far this year I want to see if
we can make it to 30 making it to 25
would be soup
great making it - nothing more than we
have is also fantastic yeah show up if
you can dang man yeah that's a Luke
underscore efr yeah okay on twitch
outside of the charity screams I'd
probably recommend not watching it's a
terrible stream but the charity streams
are great the charity streams are
planned out we do like one game per hour
this year is going to be 2017 in review
we're gonna do 20 different games
through 17 talk about what impact they
had on the gaming industry times there's
cool stuff it's pretty uncommon like
when you're like like like are there any
twitch staff in the chat right now
global we're not literally breaking
twitch's Terms of Service in your
attempt to create a service that could
allow people to break twitches Terms of
Service literally but we would never
encourage people to do that no like
seriously we would we would not
encourage people to do that okay
probably not yeah so posted by dr.
McIntosh on the forum we have our first
news item of the day a mere 20 minutes
into the stream Apple apologizes for
iphone slowdown drama will offer $29
battery placements for a year
batteries are apparently consumable
components now this is a stroke of
absolute and you'll have to pardon the
pun here genius because for the price of
people who would have been sitting in
their stores earning an hourly wage
anyway and batteries that are just
basically being sold at like not a
markup at this point or a very small
market at this point so Apple actually
gives up next to nothing here though
they do create some additional
bottlenecking in their in their cues in
all likelihood for the cost of basically
next to nothing Apple is hoping it looks
like this is my perception here is all
based on what I think it looks like
they're hoping to of
avoid lengthy expensive class-action
lawsuit and a bunch of bad PR by doing
something super duper temporary yeah so
Apple is basically going whoa whoa whoa
there's a lot of people complaining
about a thing you know what here's some
goodwill also we are not actually fixing
this problem in any long-term way so yes
go eat crap yeah am I am I missing
something here
yeah no it's pretty ridiculous so just
in case people didn't know France as far
as I know possibly other places I don't
it's a different topic we can talk about
we can talk about that now if you want
well I think it ties in really what cuz
you mentioned yeah avoid getting talk
about the lawsuit in France a group in
France called stop planned obsolescence
has filed a criminal complaint in the
French Court alleging that Apple has
violated France's energy transition law
and to be clear yeah this is the first
criminal charge against Apple related to
this dispute because it is officially
against the law to do this in France
like specifically the group believes the
law on the energy transition of 2015
prohibits the practice of planned
obsolescence which is defined by the use
of techniques by which the person
responsible for making for the marketing
of a product aims to live deliberately
reduced lifespan in order to increase
the replacement rate the complaint is
therefore criminal the law provides for
a maximum to maximum sentence of two
years in prison and up to 300,000 euros
in fines and 5% of the annual annual
turnover big deal like specifically
stated in the law that it is illegal
Apple can try to contort their pitch for
why they did it in patterns of like the
reducing shutdowns and stuff like that
but that changes nothing
yeah because the end user experience yes
because you are still more likely to
replace the phone because you have less
battery and it is specifically happening
because
of digits do reducing lifespan in order
to increase replacement rate because the
proving the in order to replace
increased replacement rate is difficult
but all that really needs to be proven
is the deliberately reducing lifespan
and you could make a fairly strong
argument that it's done to increased
replacement rate if you can demonstrate
that the replacement rate is higher
which anecdotally from testimony from
users should be fairly easy to do yeah
especially for a product like the iPhone
where so many people run out and buy the
new one every year because it's faster
this is something that I've been kind of
curious about so I don't think you were
involved in this video but we did a
really interesting piece this must have
been like a year ago anyways a long time
ago actually where we took Swift tax
flagship CPU waterblock
over ten years I think it was eight
years or something oh yeah so Jake
worked on it yeah yeah so over a span of
many years and we tested them all on a
modern flagship high-end processor and
what we observed is that every year
there were these claims of 20% better
performance or two-degree better
performance or whatever it was and if
you added them up it was nowhere near
the difference between the first one we
tested and the last one we tested now
with the waterblock you could make the
argument that every year those
improvements were more to do with
optimizing for the generation of CPU
that was being released at that time
yeah so the die size problems actually
the CPU just generating less thermals no
no no not that that's a thing because on
the same CPU on that on the news the new
block would do better than the old one
every time because they actually did
design them around them yeah okay now
let's go back to the iPhone for a minute
here when we're comparing performance on
a year on a brand-new iPhone a year old
iPhone and a two-year old iPhone as
often happens yeah whether it's a you
know
written article like a non tech or
whether it's us just holding up phones
and going which one's faster how much of
apple's marketing then has been affected
by this when they talk about the
performance improvement generation over
generation think about it when people do
independent benchmarks to look at apples
claims no i'm sure we would have heard
about it if there was some huge
discrepancy there so is Apple using
decayed performance numbers to talk
about their generational improvement Oh
scathing oh I don't know this is
actually not something that I think I
have the capability to test because you
would have to you would have to get
Apple to create for you a non degraded
you know iPhone 6 ok so there's no Apple
that's not what he's saying he's saying
the difference of improvement would is
probably in reality a little bit smaller
yeah what they're claiming like if Apple
says ok from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone
6s we improved 30% CPU performance and
then if they actually degrade this one
and then they say ok now with the 7
we've got 30% better performance it's
not a 60% improvement over that first
one it's not 30 plus 30 which actually
wouldn't be 60 yes I know just don't
worry about it
the point is that it could be
significantly smaller than what they
were advertising I don't know there's
not an accusation
there's no allegedly even there's just
just asking questions just asking
questions floatplane data on lmg
petabyte no sorry oh no someone's asking
who owns the servers and all this kind
of stuff oh okay it's it's not
floatplane is its own company its
servers are hosted elsewhere now I think
there was a backup of something on like
your nas at some point but that's been
yeah and that was that was not like very
early stages so we I'm not we're not
we're not gonna say we haven't done
anything janky that wasn't customer
stuff no to be clear and we also at this
time okay be I think the only customer
data we hold is actually through the
forum not through the floatplane site at
all yeah and it's not it's not like your
credit card info cuz we don't take
credit card it's coming though
yeah but then even then we won't store
that information will be stored by
strike alright so actually let's go back
to what Apple is offering here so the
offer continues through December 2018
for the $29 battery replacement they're
also planning to issue an iOS software
update early in 2018 that gives users
more visibility into health of their
iPhones battery so they can see for
themselves if it's condition is
affecting performance we've got a few
people asking about the 30 plus 30 thing
it's it's because we're talking 30
percent above so item B is 30 percent
above item a item C is 30 percent above
item B that doesn't mean that item C is
60 percent above item a yeah or even
approximately 60 percent because if item
B got degraded by 10 or 15% an item C is
now 30% faster than that then it's only
45 ish percent faster than the original
yeah okay um you're adding percentages
of two different things and trying to
come up with one it's not it is really
interesting to see Apple but like the
pioneer of built-in batteries that you
can't replace really changing their tune
on what a battery is to try and avoid
any legal ramifications here so they
said in its let in the letter that
batteries are consumable components but
then in 2007 this is actually a really
really great quote Apple vice marketing
vice president's hold on yeah this is
great their their vice president of
marketing said that most iPhone users
will realize as most iPod custom as iPod
customers realized that they never
needed to replace their batteries
um okay so based on their experience
they originally okay as we've began to
receive feedback about people are seeing
slower performance we now believe
another contributor to these user
experiences the continued chemical aging
of the batteries and older iPhone 6 and
6s devices many of which are still
running on their original many of which
are still running on their original
batteries what other battery that you're
supposed to put in it yeah
well I've heard he's been able to do it
the whole time my frame on my iPhone 6
is bent it got bent in my bag because
hashtag bendgate
so I don't even know how easily I would
be able to pop the scrum why not put the
battery in and then get this wall back
on cuz it actually like buckled on the
side probably easily no I haven't seen
it it's bad alright anyway so the I fix
it just to bring this up I fix it drops
its iPhone battery replacement to $29 we
don't really need to like post this link
and stuff it to be a very short thing to
talk about yeah but it's it's a kit I
wonder if I'm sure you get the battery
but it's do you get like tools and stuff
yeah it's not any cheaper so the only
benefit is that you don't have to wait
in line in a Genius Bar but I think that
having your phone yeah okay hold on
so the like the iPhone 7 plus
replacement kit comes with all the tools
you need to do it and the battery yeah
so if you buy it once and then you're
able to just source the batteries then
it's cheaper you can keep doing it for
yourself repeatedly and you can do it
for your friends and stuff and you just
need to acquire the battery yeah but
there is something to be said if it's
the same price for just having it done
at the store where if they screw it up
they owe you a new phone yes so I
personally if it was $29 versus $29
would just take my phone to the Apple
store with that said part of the problem
is that not everyone has easy access to
an Apple store have you seen what comes
in this kit oh that's pretty sick like
they're very sick it has one of the nice
screwdrivers and it has like the like
the iPhone se cool but like there's
there's different kits just so they make
sure you actually have everything
they're all pretty much the same
actually
but there's slight variations probably
just the battery in the instruction
manual but like you get some nice stuff
you get three bits you get the really
nice screwdriver which I actually like a
lot I don't know
tweezers ESD tweezers little suction
cups speaking if I fix it who by the way
isn't sponsoring the show today actual
people who are sponsoring the show today
yeah the drina's coffee mmm I don't ha
actually smells really good very lemony
nutty yeah they've got all kinds of like
wow really cool like this that not
smells like it does just smelling that
could wake you up so madrenas coffee is
coffee for fuel they've got big cans of
their cold brewed coffee with a flavor
for everyone they've got cafe mocha got
an entire thing over here they must have
sent a new shipment because I'm pretty
sure that Ed's drink all consumed
literally everything they sent last time
within like two days before anyone else
got a shot at it um so their coffees are
delicious and they have specialty grade
blends of cold brewed coffee given to
you in a convenient ready to drink can
and you can also just buy their premium

knees did you take the Momo Yuri Tao
that's right I got Moho too
oh you know I'm just people buffalo
bacon is still in here
apparently so I can just hold up the
package I think all of that on our the
first day this shipment arrived dang it
hmm you know what there's a pack of
traditional I'm not gonna subject myself
to the hottest stuff today because let
me tell you guys if you are into hot
jerky I have had multiple people go out
of their way to contact me and say you
know what I love hot jerky I can eat hot
turkey all day when you guys said savage
jerky is really hot I was like yeah it's
probably not that hot I ordered some
it's that hot I wonder what made things
maybe soulmate doesn't have a sense of
smell as far as I know or it's extremely
really reduced
I don't remember it's one of the tube so
it actually helps them deal with spicy
food like a lot and he can deal with
like insanity levels of spicy food and
he ordered some I would love to hear
from me but I haven't I haven't heard
from alright so savage turkey is made
with the best ingredients without
nitrates or preservatives the goal is to
create a snack that's full of flavor and
spice but that isn't bad for you we've
got 13 different flavors my personal
favorites are the maple buffalo bacon
the Moho is really good traditional is
really good the cracked pepper and sea
salts really guys we got a lot of great
flavors yeah if you're into the hot
they've got Jerky's that are made out of
Carolina Reapers ghost peppers there's
another super crazy hot one those ones
are not for the faint of heart
for real um they've also got barbecue
sauce hot sauce and a spice rub their
Carolina Reaper hot sauce is made using
one of the hottest peppers in the world
the jalapeno I'm just kidding the
Carolina Reaper it's like right in the
names had been fairly obvious anyway you
can use offer code LTT to save 10% on
their products over at Savage jerky
dot-com
could I do for you I'm gonna just do a
thing are you okay all right let's see
let's see if it distorts oh oh oh risky
rescue everything will be fine all right
so else we got four topics today I feel
like there's gonna be so you want to
talk about people dying oh yeah I guess
we can try to keep them fairly short
that really thinks they're pretty
important have to talk about it yeah so
oh I want to talk about this too it'll
be fairly short but yeah yep for sure
keep it condensed all right where is the
first one geez
breaking news there we go this was
posted over on PC Gamer calm so I don't
know if we want to put like the guys
twitch account or anything on blast
definitely not gonna talk about who did
it because I'm very against the last
thing these people need is more
attention exactly um I'm very against
making celebrities around terrible
people but Andrew Finch is the person
who passed away in this whole thing so
we can talk about him because he had
absolutely nothing to do with this and
it's very sad that he was involved in
this at all anyways someone was
harassing a twitch streamer to some
degree saying that they were going to
swat them as a prank and all this kind
of stuff so as far as I know there was
kind of a like bring it on bro that was
proposed and super done by the way yeah
and a fake address was given but this
wasn't an actually fake address it was
someone fake Street yeah it was
someone's actual home and that home was
swatted the SWAT team apparently oh here
we go yeah in this case one gamer
essentially dared the other two SWAT him
but provided an address that wasn't his
own but was nearby so that's apparently
what happened police believe they were
responding to a report of a murder and
hostage situation at Finch's home when
Andrew Finch came to the door he was
shot and killed these situations are
always hard because if if he
I had his hands in a sweater or
something like that yeah it could look
like he's trying to conceal a gun I
don't know what's going on I'm not
blaming anyone except for the people
that were involved and I don't want to
name them the two main people that were
involved that's what I'm saying I don't
want to name them very very
disappointing situation swatting in its
own is is terrible and causing it to
happen to someone that that someone that
isn't even remotely involved is even
worse so yeah this whole thing not good
the officer who killed Finch when he
answered his front door has been placed
on administrative paid leave so which is
probably good see what happens with that
hopefully you get some psych help as
well because he's probably traumatized
which is another side effect of these
things happening which is why they
shouldn't be done
so what calls for hot current hostage
and very recent murder like the the guys
on the SWAT call that yeah
hard hard situation deal with moving on
there's another one we'll just get rid
of this one while we're at it a 44 year
old Russian man was playing a Star Wars
VR game the game that was being played
has nothing to do with the actual story
he fell and he hit his head on a glass
table apparently based on the medical
examiner's report the man continued
playing the game instead of seeking any
form of immediate medical attention and
lost a lot of blood in the process he
eventually succumbed to his injuries and
died there has been no toxicology
information done so there's no knowledge
of whether he was like potentially under
the influence of drugs or alcohol which
may have promoted him not realizing how
much blood he was losing well depending
on how deep you get cut you can actually
like not feel it very much yeah like
that nerves are mostly at the surface so
he could have had a like pretty
egregious injury and he's in VR so he
wouldn't be able to see it I would
assume oh that if you're not drunk or
high in any form that
be able to feel it like I'm seeing
enough blood to die but then it's also
compulsive and it's warm and warm as is
harder to really feel depending on how
is like the game you are you might be
sweating already
so could fit yeah and if you're wearing
like a sweater like to be clear I'm not
saying that you know I'm not saying that
you he probably shouldn't have known to
like pop out of the game for a minute
like check himself if you get hit if you
get hit in the head
any-any like if you fall in your head
hit something it is bad there's no like
there's no thing around that you should
get yourself checked out to a certain
degree make sure that you're not mildly
consult player yeah yeah actually no
means the only concussion I ever had was
in rugby and I thought I was completely
fine and my coach like demanded to drive
me home and then partway on the drive
home I was like something's wrong and we
had to stop then I puked all over the
side of the road because I thought I was
fine but had a concussion so yeah check
yourself out if you hit your head on
anything head injuries are brutal very
sorry to hear that this man passed away
on two different news yeah this one kind
of interesting you want to do gaming
disorder is now a mental condition or to
the world health supposed to by hey yo
on the forum yeah yeah the original
article is from Forbes here and I will
just click continue to article because
that's not a parent I did not okay
do you have gaming disorder a newly
recognized mental health condition
probably well let's find out let's find
ya let's see let's diagnose me
okay gaming disorder is characterized by
a pattern of persistent or recurrent
gaming behaviors yep okay okay so far
I'm screwed
Digital gaming or video gaming okay both
ha which maybe online okay Internet yeah
or offline not over theater okay it's
still screwed okay alright
manifested by one impaired control over
gaming for example onset frequency
intensity duration termination and
context okay I'm screwed okay
yeah to increasing priority given to
gaming to the extent that gaming takes
precedent over other life interests and
daily activities alright alright it
doesn't say how many other life
interests that's the problem so if it
takes precedence over anything yeah I
mean would you say gaming is more
important than running to take a crap
sometimes I've never I've never actually
pooped myself but no but like but gamer
bladder is a thing Oh totally a thing
we're like you won't go pee for like a
whole day because you've just been
sitting down the whole time you brought
all your supplies to wherever your
gaming yeah you're eating you're
drinking you're gaming the whole day
goes by you stand up at all sudden
you're like whoa and that puts pressure
on your bladder and is actually not a
good thing so okay sure number three
continuation or escalation of gaming
despite the occurrence of negative
consequence okay yeah yeah I'm still
screwed okay okay but there's a few
other things here okay so the behavior
pattern needs to be of sufficient
severity to result in significant
impairment in personal family social
educational occupational or other
important areas of functioning okay I
don't think I've heard one of them
previously in my life but not now yeah
okay yeah I told my girlfriend that I
was grounded on Tuesdays and Thursdays
so I could raid but that was a long time
ago okay a long time ago yeah this
sounds like some of the some of the some
of the like celebrities and stuff who
have been accused of sexual assault
we're like the defense's that was a you
know what you're disordered man that's
it that's all there is to it you were
disordered yeah there's no denying it
okay the pattern of gaming behavior must
be may be continuous episodic or
recurrent see oh maybe it recurs then
you're done alright but yeah yeah but
it's at Mei Mei so the gaming behavior
and other features are normally evident
over a period of at least 12 months in
order for a diagnosis to be assigned
although the required duration may be
shortened if all diagnostic requirements
are met and symptoms are severe so what
happens if your
so this inclusion basically means that
in a could you be forcefully
hospitalized in a more socialist country
like say for example yes I think some
people would argue Canada is pretty darn
socialist yeah
it could be that your tax dollars could
be spent rehabilitating someone from
gaming disorder so the inclusion in the
you're gonna have to rehabilitate me in
the WHL guidelines will mean that it
will officially become a health
condition a diagnosis that can be used
by doctors official healthcare other
healthcare workers and insurance
companies so you can't be because
there's some cases where you can be
admitted to like a mental health
hospital by someone who isn't yourself
right that's a thing right uh I can
speak from not my own personal
experience being admitted but I
definitely know someone who is admitted
okay not if they're so good you pure
committed to a hospital for gaming
addiction it's like not of your own
accord to be clear this is not gaming
addiction this is gaming disorder Gaming
disorders Gaming disorder gave me a
disorder because it's broader could
someone bring their kid I'd be like my
kid likes League of Legends so the
League of Legends it's illegal sorry yes
if you're gonna be the ignorant parent
okay my kid is addicted to the wall the
wall yeah okay the wall the wall the lol
yeah okay could you put them in a
hospital imagine this like that has its
own like essentially like white padded
cell doesn't have video games could you
have gaming disorder so bad that you
need disability pay oh my god oh my god
the twitch chats like they like League
of Legends that's a disorder oh yeah
bird that was pretty good I like that oh
so wait but do they take away your
gaming stuff if you have disabilities
because then then wouldn't they just be
paying you to indulge and you
yeah but like that's like like okay I
don't know what that what amendment it
probably is there's probably some
amendment where it's nobody's business
what you spend your money seriously yeah
it's just like in much the same way that
you can like be disabled and you can be
getting like you can be okay like you
can get this I don't know what the
government money is called because
there's all kinds of different
government money for different like
there's disability and there's out of
work but not disabled and then there's
out of work temporarily and then there's
like mental health disorder out of work
and then there's like welfare I don't
even know what welfare is exactly but
like it's something to do with is it
called welfare in Canada I don't even
think so yeah yeah like I don't know
some kind of social services some kind
of stuff there's lots of different names
but like I don't think they're allowed
to tell you hey by the way the reason
that you're not very functional is that
you've like been super addicted to drugs
for a long time and your brain is addled
you can't spend this money we're giving
you on drugs like I actually don't think
they can do that so if they can't do
that how do they prevent you from
spending money on a graphics and they're
not going to take things from you so I'm
not gonna take your computer they're not
going to tell ya like I don't think they
can do yeah so you just get paid to play
video games I mean if we're gonna do
this like if we're gonna you know if
we're gonna do this then let's just have
a minimum guaranteed income and get it
out of the way which we're working on to
be fair
Canada's working on that there's a pilot
project somewhere in Ontario some little
town because it is time like if if we're
the the only option here appears like
you're gonna go socialism there you go
full socialism okay oh man this is this
is this is gonna be there is gonna be
some lawsuits and there's gonna be some
whoa like some public admitting in order
to get disability insurance or
disability money yeah and like whatever
can you imagine like it said
specifically insurance companies can you
imagine insurance companies being able
to charge you a higher premium because
you got diagnosed with Gamer disorder
when you were like a kid or whatever
like can you imagine what my goodness
and this is so fake can we can we pay
attention that to like it's really vague
holy cow like if I if I like update a
little mobile game under the table at
dinner one time
is that like impairing why my grandpa
doesn't like it then that's what made
your family function man
yeah like holy cow all right this is
cool this was posted by Tim Orff on the
forum the original article is from
techspot here and this was something you
said um I'm 100% certain that I played
EverQuest or Wow or something when my
mom didn't want me to like did I did I
like interfere with family functions we
moved on to a different topic
okay so edition over there this is
[Laughter]
awkward so okay so proposed DMCA not an
actual thing yes proposed it's a DMCA
exemption would allow people to
resurrect dead online games this has
been brought us it's pretty quiet the
Museum of Art and digital entertainment
my biggest reason why I like this yes is
because honestly gaming companies have
been in a really weird spot yeah it's
not even entirely their fault
I don't really have a choice No so like
Blizzard going after the private server
guys anyone else taking an online game
that requires server login to some kind
so it's just wow is an easy example for
this and it's like been very recently
largely it's also not a perfect example
though because it's like technically
still supported so even though it's just
like newer versions of it let's use the
matrix online sure Oh terrible game but
let's use the matrix online someone
still wants to play it someone is
actively trying to essentially rebuild
that game but the people that made the
matrix online and the people that owned
the rights to the matrix online or the
matrix in general can't allow them to
spin up their own servers because under
like copyright style law that would be
not defending your copyright or
something it's it's not defending your
something I think it's copyright so with
this
exemption that would mean that you don't
have to go after these people to defend
your copyright mm-hmm you don't have to
that's no longer a thing
so these gaming companies would be able
to just let people you build small tiny
little communities around their games
that they don't want to or can't support
anymore and it says in here
EA the Electronic Arts online services
shutdown list includes more than 300
titles and servers dropped out of
service in the last four years and so
anyone who tries to resurrect any of
those things is going to end up with a
seasoned assist notice from the
copyright holder because otherwise if EA
themselves ten years down the line and
we had seen gaming franchises get
resurrected after ten years of
inactivity
that's the thing I mean look at okay
Serious Sam yeah would have been an
example of that I don't know if it was
ten years but it was a lot yeah anything
valve does yeah anyway the point is if
they ever want to resurrect that IP the
fact that they haven't been defending it
all this time weakens their copyright
claim yeah against all of it
so it's a big problem now something like
WoW is confusing because with wow what
people are trying to resurrect is like
wrath of Lich King Burning Crusade and
classic with are three different
versions of Wow but why was still
running and still exists yeah so it's in
a very gray area I don't think I don't
think you'd be able to win with this one
because then how do you define a patch
versus an expansion and how quickly can
someone actually do this in Exeter
etcetera so the last time this was
brought up in 2015 it was shut down
because the proposal because the
specific games mentioned in the proposal
could still be played over a LAN but the
new request argues that local
multiplayer is not really a thing
anymore yeah it's so if you don't have
the option it's almost never to play it
on a land Nintendo still doing it and
the servers are shut down then
effectively it's just gone you can't
have that experience anymore yeah and
why for what
doesn't make any sense I I'm a huge
proponent of this and I don't think this
is gonna stop companies like EA from
being dickbags
but it will allow people to ignore that
anyways and be like well this is the DMC
exception I'm just gonna run this
anyways what's up oh sorry I just oh
yeah yeah okay it's the last last topic
sure posted by alluminium tech on the
forum um
Netflix ads HD are streaming to Windows
10 in the uwp app and Microsoft edge
which we actually think we might have a
better understanding of why 4k and HDR
would be exclusive to Microsoft edge it
actually there's some there's some
things like especially in this that are
a little bit more complicated to figure
out why than what we did but in general
edge seems to handle color color and
some other video stuff better than other
browsers which is weird
sucks in like so many different ways but
it's good at that so you can get HDR
Netflix if you have a premium net fix
plan you use Microsoft edge or the
universal Windows app if you have
Windows 10 with the fall creators update
if you have an HDR display if you have
an Intel 7th gen or newer CPU ambi not
supported and if you have integrated
graphics or a gtx ten series with three
gigs of VRAM or more AMD not supported
that's a lot of that's a lot of stars
and asters yeah okay what is a premium
Netflix plan is there non-premium
Netflix plans yeah you're just like
1080p or 4k or whatever like I have a
premium one so that means you have a 4k
streaming plan yeah it costs like
another six bucks a month or whatever Oh
wasn't that included at some point I had
no idea I got on the Netflix bandwagon
like super late okay yeah all right so
that's pretty much it for the show today
thank you so much for tuning in you know
guys again
no no floatplane we will never see you
guys again because he's going to Flo
place oh yeah we've actually got a bunch
of really cool stuff over on Flo plane
right now should I go on to the actual
site I want to do it on the site sure I
want to do it on the site
gonna be confusing for people again I
already wasn't able to do support quest
for this week sorry if you sent in a
support ticket and you're like what the
heck it will be responded to this
weekend probably not tonight so I have
to prepare for the stream probably not
tomorrow because I'm doing a big 24 hour
charity stream probably not Sunday
because I'll still be doing the 20 hour
charity stream and sleeping but either
Sunday or Monday and it's a long weekend
so I'm including Monday as in the
weekend you're gonna have to stop doing
those 24 hour streams we've talked about
this I know it's 20 this time it's 20
yeah it's we're saying like 20-ish we're
talking about it he's like yeah like I
don't know what it is every time I do
one of these 24 hours dreams I get sick
yeah and like even if I sleep enough
hours like I still feel like crap I'm
like yo dude you're old yeah it's
happening exactly the same I
specifically act so the theme with this
one so the stream that does the best is
my like birthday charity stream mm-hmm
and I think why is because I do a whole
bunch of games but I do each game just
for an hour and there's a reason why
it's there it's it's my favorite game
from that year and we iterate one game
every year so I was trying to recreate
that idea and someone suggested what if
you just do games from 2017 so I went
okay I'm gonna do interesting not
necessarily good not necessarily bad but
interesting games in 2017 so like
battlefront 2 is gonna be involved oh
yeah because we'll just talk during the
stream about the loot box controversy
and what actually happened with the game
what happened at Yale like I stuff so to
be games eating disorder confirmed yeah
pretty much yeah no yeah exactly
good call but yeah it like games that
are discussion worthy is what we're
gonna do a wood so so I axed a whole
bunch that were actually discussion
worthy because I was like nope nope nope
nope nope I need to get this stream
shorter so I cut it down to 20 all right
i boo floodplain okay so that's a
placeholder thing right there don't
ignore that yeah but it looks like Kyle
has a video up USB see all the things if
you are subscribed to bit wit
specifically but would altra yeah Kyle
also has a thing here
wait have we been fishing stuff live on
this still yeah no I don't think we have
oh well people aren't clicking public
then dang it
hooray okay I will your employees now
yeah okay so there are if you ever
actually tell people how to do it
I don't think you did yeah Nick did
super late but you never did did you did
you told me not to make that video that
I had already fully planned because you
would do it no I should have just done
that um I told me I should down to
Leah's best case under 35 bucks that's
are you live on YouTube oh dang okay mm
so no one's been pushing public great
all right I I did I published this which
also has a description
this thing's sick by the way cool 144
Hertz 300 bucks us Wow IPS 1440p Wow 28
inch Wow killer absolutely killer that's
cool
like the crushinator um we got it from
an eBay seller the same guys who sent
over that that pretty cheap ultra-wide
like a while back interesting that's
pretty cool handy wake up tech this
video was done cool Oh brilliant oh I'm
on oh well reasons why we don't use the
site that's still being developed on um
okay so that's fair that's fair what you
said just there you were fair to me just
now so to explain to the viewers who are
probably like what the heck he's on his
creator account so his creator account
isn't technically subscribed to himself
I think yeah I thought we fixed that but
that might have been overwritten or no
no you you fixed it for Kyle oh yeah but
like it was like it was a temporary fix
like a dumb fix like not a real fix wait
what is this oh yeah why you do this to
me what you can do is also not working I
hate you so much I hate you with all of
my heart and soul great all right all
right so what do we got over there this
is a cool video
oh that's I've been waiting to see this
thing for seven years the chiller
resurrection is real there it is
check this out that is a CPU cooler
right there that thing you're looking at
that I'm lifting up onto the desk so we
got to originally make that thing
it was the first oh man
hold on did I work in and cix yet just
trying to think I think it was my first
summer with Yvonne so I've been like 13
years ago yeah so you resurrected a CPU
cooler from 13 years ago yeah yeah so
it's like actively cooled and all this
kind of stuff that's it's like it's like
refrigerant cooled it's pretty sick
we've got a tech quickie on Dolby Atmos
and DTS X because a lot of people
actually didn't really know what they
were
by the way I always suggest it today and
I was very surprised that we haven't
done it we should do it tech working on
crypto currencies oh we haven't in it Oh
was it just like a long time we that was
a long time ago is this does it movies
maybe do a new one John's working on it
okay cool Yvonne was giving me crap
about it just like Austin did one I'm
like yeah so did we she's like well he
did one recently okay we'll make a new
one um what else we got oh the beginning
of this video is sick like it's actually
awesome
it's like epically cinematic and stuff
what
this is the lenovo 25th anniversary
edition ThinkPad like isn't this just
way over the top for why did oh my
goodness that is ridiculous it's all
just for fun yeah yeah we have the
review of the dankest gurga Namit
keyboard the ergo docks easy that's got
LED lighting on an ergonomic keyboard
because why not
Dale the sleeper is live noise this has
been really well received this is not I
think strictly speaking as powerful as
the last sleeper PC but it's super small
6 core processor and it's in this epic
epic chassis really cool build tech
showdown part 3 is up and the conclusion
goes up tomorrow for those of you who
have been watching tech showdown but
I've been a little disappointed feedback
on part 3 is a lot better part 3 is kind
of where it picks up so part 3 is where
you're gonna want to go watch it over on
I'm surprised it's gonna be four parts
um I didn't expect for parts when we
were shooting long story ok so I think
that's pretty much it for what we've got
going on right now yeah cool
there we go although I thought I had
like like an exclusive behind-the-scenes
that maybe I forgot to post I think I
did ok just you know remember the market
public see it's confusing because
they're know there's marking in public
in the CMS which we have to do and then
there's like remembering to like post a
