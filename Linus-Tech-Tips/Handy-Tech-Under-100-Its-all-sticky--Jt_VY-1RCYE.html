a hundred and this time we're going to
get hard and sticky so come along and
let's fix your pipe manage your cables
and then cool you off at the end
the Aria headphones from Phoenix come
complete with a cardioid clip mic and
acoustic chambers constructed entirely
of Japanese Pinewood check it out in the
link below setting us off with number
one is fiberfix it's a resin product
that can bond to metal and wood that's
available in a patch a heat wrap and a
repair rep that's the one that I bought
it claims that it could harden like
steel sounds great I'm in so to put it
to the test
I cut through a table leg support with
an angle grinder then I followed the
fiber fix instructions by preparing the
surface around the break by sanding it
down with the included sandpaper a
little bit and I included some filing
just to make it go a bit faster then I
put on my gloves and dumped the fiberfix
wrap under water for about five seconds
now fiberfix doesn't adhere the same way
traditional tape does I had to wrap the
first few layers carefully making sure
they were at least in the right location
then with subsequent layers I cranked it
in a little bit to make sure that it was
all tight following this I wrapped some
of the included vinyl strips on top of
that also cranking those down and let it
sit for about 15 minutes to cure before
removing the vinyl then it was time to
test it
ok so it did come off but that's
actually because I deformed the entire
pipe against the rock the problem here
wasn't the strength or rigidity of the
fiber fix it was its ability to adhere
to the pipe which I did score quite a
bit although admittedly I didn't get all
of the paint off but the fact of the
matter is I can still pull the remaining
still unbroken part out of the end I
would suggest using fiber fix along with
some type of super glue or Gorilla Glue
depending on the project I'm very happy
with its strength but I'm not a huge fan
of its adherence watch this look quick
you're not going to see this completely
on camera but you look there I can just
pull it right out be next up we have
item number 2 sugru its creators
it moldable glue and after taking
however much you need out of the package
you can stick it to loads of different
things like ceramics glass metal and
wood along with most plastics and even
fabrics you then have 30 minutes to fix
bond cushion replace mold seal and stick
things together then after waiting 24
hours suger will turn into a durable
flexible silicone rubber that in the
vast majority of cases will stay stuck
permanently unless you decide to remove
it suru can stand up to some pretty
intense conditions as well it's
temperature resistant up to 180 degrees
Celsius or down to negative 50 degrees
Celsius it's dishwasher safe
weatherproof and even resist the effects
of the ever dreaded salt water it's
shock resistant UV resistant and it's
even electrically insulating below 24
volts acceptable for small electronics
projects I had John use it for a number
of things including some cable
management cable strengthening mounting
an SSD in a computer case and more if
you'd like to see a huge range of stuff
that suger can do check out their tech
DIY outdoors and general tips sections
on their site I was originally going to
make a video on Channel super-fun about
this stuff way back in 2014 but ended up
using it all before we got around to it
it's pretty great which brings us to our
third and final handy sticky product
arctic silver thermal adhesive this
stuff is the real deal I mean it
includes a warning stating that yes it
is a permanent adhesive components that
you attach with arctic silver thermal
adhesive will stay attached forever your
7 grams of thermal adhesive is split in
three point 5 gram parts across syringe
a and syringe B you will need to mix
these parts like an epoxy in equal
one-to-one ratios on some sort of tray
that you don't mind throwing away after
mixing you can use the included mini
spatula to apply the solution to your
heat sink or chip or whatever you're
trying to stick together wafer to cure
and voila permanently adhered thermal
transfer with solid performance to boot
its Arctic
silver right so it has 62 to 65 percent
silver content by weight pretty intense
you can learn more about why this
matters here but why would you want this
well if you're doing a law to a graphics
card which will remove the cooling on a
few chips or just working on the smaller
electronics project it can often be
useful to be able to add heat sinks in
places where there aren't holes to mount
them by traditional means
and since thermal stickers perform worse
and don't hold very well under any kind
of weight load and drilling through the
PCB randomly is obviously a terrible
idea this is better than nothing which
brings us finally to the full disclosure
part of these handy tech episodes
lannis originally included this section
since they're structured more as a
recommendation to buy with links below
to Amazon versus a review I personally
think this was a wise choice without
further ado item one the fiberfix was
purchased by me to use for work
Taron suggested we get it when Linus
broke the trailer and while he already
found a solution for that it seemed like
a great idea to have some around in the
future for just any whatever use case
item to the suru was sent to us by sugru
themselves for use around the office and
we told them since we already had
experience with the product a couple
years ago that we were pretty sure it
would make its way into a video at some
point this is that video item 3 the
thermal adhesive was purchased by Linus
to put the dam 6700 K back together
again because it's been apart for a
really long time and the tube of thermal
adhesive that he had from like six years
ago happened to dry out if you're not a
member of Dollar Shave Club and you
joined today you will get your first
month of razors for free they will
deliver these razors continually if you

shaving at that point in time which is
pretty helpful they ship to the US
Canada and Australia so head over
dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus and give
them a try for free alright guys thanks
for watching this video hopefully you
liked my first debut into handy
Tech if you did let me know in the
comments down below hit that like button
get subscribed all that fun stuff if you
hated it
dislike that's that's fine also if
you're interested in any of these things
you can find them at the Amazon links
down below you can check out our shirt
store also down below and check out this
video which is the third handy tech ever
to go on YouTube I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
