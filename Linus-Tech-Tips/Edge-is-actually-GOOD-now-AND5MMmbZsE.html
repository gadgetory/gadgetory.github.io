originally known as project Spartan in
2015 which wow it's not only four years
ago feels like a lot longer than that
you know what they say time flies when
you're having fun anyway out of the gate
edge brought some interesting features
to the table like a reading mode and the
ability to easily markup and share web
pages but it was also slow and memory
hungry and it lacked support for the
thousands of helpful browser extensions
that you could get on Chrome and Firefox
so while it peaked at 20 percent market
share among Windows 10 users in August
of 2015 its subsequent slide over the
following months and years indicates
that most of those people are probably
just using it to download Chrome so then
in late 2018 after four long years of
progressively more desperate tactics to
get people to please please just try it
please know Microsoft decided that
rather than trying to fight chrome they
would enter the belly of the beast
becoming Chrome then destroying it from
the inside just kidding I mean that
might be what they're doing we actually
don't know but what we do know is that
there's a freaking chromium powered edge
browser out there in the wild and we
spent the last couple of days finding
out whether it's the next big thing or
the browser equivalent of two kids
stacked on top of each other wearing a
trench coat so they can get a ticket for
your pg-13 taskbar today's video is
brought to you by Corsair the corsair
iron claw RGB wireless mouse features a
native 18,000 dpi optical sensor a
comfortable palm grip and sub 1
millisecond slipstream technology check
it out at the link below
for the uninitiated chromium is Google's
free and open source software project
that forms the foundation of Google's
mainline Chrome browser builds which by
contrast are not open-source so what
that means is that anyone including
Microsoft can take that Foundation and
potentially build their own browser on
top of it and actually Microsoft is far
from the first company to do this some
of the more well-known third-party
chromium based browsers include opera
brave Amazon silk and Samsung's aptly
named Internet now the new chromium
powered edge is not fully launched yet
but Microsoft is publishing developer
builds as they get closer to the full
rollout and that means that we can try
it right now so we're gonna be using the
Windows 10 version but this is kind of
cool the new edge will actually be
available on Android iOS and even Mac OS
so let's get started when you open a new
tab you get some layout options focused
has some frequently visited sites and a
simple search bar unfortunately powered
by Bing
but fortunately with the option to
change it to Google search dr. ko or Ask
Jeeves or whatever and the next up is
inspirational layout which adds the
pretty Microsoft background of the day
to the mix or the informational layout
which adds an MSN style new section on
your first Buddha pub the app it will
probably prompt you to import your
chrome data including bookmarks or
favorites you're safe passwords your
autofill entries and your browsing
history but if you're not a hundred
percent sure about the switch you can
also do that in the settings later once
you do that it actually begins to feel
eerily like you're using a Microsoft
skinned version of Chrome though right
down to the menu layouts so most of the
settings that you'd expect to find are
there but like it's weird because they
might be located in a different submenu
it's like using a chrome from an
alternate universe where like the snap
never happened
spoilers spoilers he spent more than a
year to see the first part perhaps the
weirdest part though of the new edge
experience is installing Chrome
extensions now by default the new edge
only allows you to install a small
number of Microsoft approved edge
insider add-ons but in true chromium
fashion you can allow the installation
of any extension from the Chrome Web
Store by simply clicking allow
extensions from other stores with that
said there's no guarantee it'll work
LastPass for example wouldn't let us
sign-in on edge now thankfully there was
an edge version already available and
that one worked fine we're just saying
that whether it's for security reasons
or other compatibility reasons Microsoft
says that the list of official add-ons
will increase as they go through and
verify them so it's not that they're
taking a walled garden approach they
just want to make sure that the user
experience is ok so then if you were
like amped to switch from Chrome to edge
we just want you to keep in mind that
you might not have all of your chrome
features exactly as you like them also
making matters worse if you are one of
the edge faithful hi Microsoft's
chromium based reboot might be a bit of
a bummer for you too because a fresh
start means that the current build is
even lacking some of the features of old
edge so these include setting aside tabs
style of support ooh that's kind of
rough for you surface pro users out
there and an official dark mode although
you can at least enable a beta version
of that last one in the flags now the
edge team has promised that those
features will return and they've also
committed to new ones like easily
shareable tab collections a three-tiered
privacy control system and best of all
and Internet Explorer compatibility mode
I'm actually not joking about this that
is a godsend
not only for nostalgic masochists but
also for corporate and IT workers that
are stuck using legacy apps that just
won't run on modern browsers and the
edge engineers say they're not only
creating new features for their own
brows
they're also submitting suggestions to
the chromium open-source project which
might influence other chromium based
browsers and even chrome itself for any
of this actually matter though edge has
to perform as well as Chrome Firefox or
the others and actually given edges
reputation as that new browser it
probably has to perform even better so
we ran chrome new edge old edge and
Firefox through a handful of benchmarks
html5 tests for pure html5 performance
base mark for a mix of JavaScript and
graphically intense workloads and web
expert for a wide sampling of tasks
intended to mirror everyday browser use
and I got a say for a fledgling browser
the new edge held up alright it kept up
pretty well with chrome although both of
them lost to Firefox and web expert and
it beat both the old edge and Firefox in
Basemark now it did have the worst pure
html5 performance out of our tested
browsers but then we ran the test again
using HTTPS instead of HTTP which
brought it score up to a tie with Chrome
so then at least from a pure performance
standpoint the new chromium based edge
is immediately a big step up from the
old edge and extremely close to chrome
in terms of what you can expect from
day-to-day browsing so with a well
performing feature-rich extension had
the alternative to Chrome on the table
other than Firefox of course sorry
Firefox fans you guys are still a thing
um we should just all be celebrating
them right like competition is good
right not so fast
so we've talked a lot about what a
chromium powered edge browser means for
the user experience but there's another
huge question that the existence of this
chimeric concoction brings up is google
about to fundamentally own the ability
to set their own standards for how the
internet is developed because here's the
thing depending on where you get your
stats chrome has been sitting at around
65 to 75 percent global desktop browser
market share with edge around five and
the supposedly defunct internet explorer
still
around five to ten percent now Firefox
and Safari
still have healthy enough user bases but
think about this once this new edge
actually launches and edge and Internet
Explorer users hopefully switch over as
much as 85 percent of the internet could
be dominated by browsers based on Google
own software that gives Google an
unprecedented level of control over the
way the internet will continue to change
and while Google has developed many
standards and protocols that have
benefited all web users like the speedy
protocol that formed the basis for HTTP
2 they've also been responsible for some
shady locked ecosystem type stuff in the
past like changing YouTube so that it
ran worse on non chrome browsers wait
I'm just trying to think was that before
or after they removed don't be evil from
their corporate motto
do you remember yeah I mean either so
the thing is all of that could be much
ado about nothing and for their part
Google has said they remain committed to
the open web and will continue to work
with others in the web browser ecosystem
but we still thought it was important to
not just try out new edge in this video
but to also point out that if you
subscribe to the age-old wisdom about
absolute power and absolute corruption
and all that you might want to at least
give Firefox a try sure or Safari this
video is brought to you by the drop X
Alex Cavalli tube hybrid amp it was
built from the ground up by drop and
Alex Cavalli a longtime favorite from
the audiophile community it combines
solid state and vacuum tube amps it's
got an entirely new circuitry design it
delivers the required current for planar
magnetic headphones and thanks to its
high voltage it can drive dynamic
headphones to perform their best it's
got a one-year warranty and you can
check it out at the link in the video
description
so thanks for watching guys if you
disliked this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
the link in the video description you
don't have to buy it you can just
