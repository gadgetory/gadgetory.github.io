dog to run out and buy an OLED TV
because they look awesome oh and also
high-end products usually have the best
profit margins but let's face it hardly
anyone can justify dumping 3/4 or even
up to $17,000 into a new TV
then there's the budget category I mean
we're talking like $400 4k TVs like this
one well it's no accident that LG has
nothing to compete at this price stores
like Amazon sell a lot of these kinds of
products but this segment often gets
ignored by the premium brands because
the margins on them are so thin that
it's just not even worth the effort for
them which puts the sweet spot where it
so often is in the middle with LCD TVs
like a samsung q LED for a little over
$2,000 you see what they did there it
even looks like OLED on the box or this
one the LG 65 SK 95 super UHD which you
can actually get for around the same
price but just what is super about it
and can it take a chunk out of Samsung's
dominant TV market share we'll find out
after this message from glasswire
glasswire is a firewall that displays
your PC's incoming and outgoing network
connections in real time use offer code
Linus and get 25% off glasswire 2.0 at
the link below
the 65s k95 is LG's highest-end non OLED
TV at $2,400 so no they're not ditching
OLED yet but they're acutely aware that
until OLED makes up a lot more than the
15 percent of their overall TV sales
that they are currently they are going
to need other offerings as we mentioned
before Samsung's Q LED TVs really have
nothing to do with OLED but they're
really impressive for LCDs thanks to
quantum technology which allows them to
get brighter more saturated colors
across a wider gamut by transmitting
only pure red pure green and pure blue
your typical LCD will emit a wider
spectrum of light that includes in
between colors like orange and lime
leading to color D saturation and
inefficiency so that is where LG's super
UHD comes in super UHD not to be
confused with Samsung's su HD is an
attempt to get similar performance to
quantum dot but with a different
approach and that's what this nano cell
marketing that you see on the box is
getting at now no one actually knows
quite for sure but this technology
appears to add a layer of uniformly
sized particles each about one nanometer
in diameter that's about a hundred
thousand times thinner than a sheet of
paper to filter out the unwanted color
wavelengths and leave just r g and b
thereby preventing color bleeding fading
and other effects that reduce the
vibrancy of the picture and it seems to
be working the picture looks really good
fiddling with the settings we were able
to get about 89% coverage of the DCI p3
color space and color accuracy that's
good enough to edit photos using the
Technicolor expert bright mode I mean I
mean if your desk had enough room to use
this thing as a monitor and while they
can't compete with OLED nothing can the
black levels are really nice with smooth
gradients thanks to the full array local
dimming which is quickly going from a
pricey exotic feature to a must-have
I mean it makes enough of a difference
but even though this TV is actually
quite a bit thicker than last year's
model I'm not even mad at all like
finally somebody has woken up as a
consumer I've been asking for this
give me more performance instead of one
more millimeter I mean this is thin
enough anyway and the finish on the back
and the sides is nothing short of
premium I'd be happy to see this thing
in my living room and I'm really glad to
see that we are finally coming to the
end of thinner just for the sake of
thinner in the mainstream product line
at least because I'm also acutely aware
that LG literally has a product called
the wallpaper TV on the subject of more
performance the full array local dimming
is here for a good reason to support HDR
this puppy has actual 10-bit color no
FRC malarkey and 700 nits peak with 400
nits sustained brightness so that is a
bit under the 1000 it fresh hold that I
would consider like true modern HDR but
they did pull off they'll be vision
certification whose main advantage over
HDR 10 is that it comes with
scene-by-scene metadata for a higher
degree of backlight control and speaking
of Dolby it also has a built-in dolby
atmos decoder so if you're thinking of
getting speakers on or aimed at your
ceiling you don't need an extra Atmos
compatible receiver as long as the HDMI
signal goes through the TV finally the
65 SK 95 has a refresh rate of a hundred
and twenty Hertz or 240 if your
tasteless and you turn on true motion
but don't get too excited about it quite
yet even though I'm sure that LG has
seen the video that we made outlining
how our ideal TV would have DisplayPort
so it could you can game on it high
refresh rates this one lacks either a DP
1.4 or an HDMI 2.1 port so it won't be
able to receive high frame rate 4k
content from external sources so you
would have to stream your HFR content
not that there's a lot of that Oh
there but and this is something I'm glad
to see because we've been complaining
about the gaming experience on LG TVs
for quite some time at least they do
allow you to run at 120 Hertz if you
connect to the TV with your PC if you
turn the resolution down to 1080p the
input leg isn't too shabby at around 33
milliseconds so not as fast as a
high-end gaming monitor but a
significant improvement over last year
and because it's not OLED you've got the
additional benefit of not having to
worry about your HUD burning in and
showing up while you're watching your
favorite movies also new this year is
voice assistant integration coming from
both the Google assistant and LG's own
thin queue soft you know what no I'm
calling it think think U is obviously
not what the marketing team intended and
if it is then shame on them anyway the
TV is not microphone equipped so it's
not always listening like a Google Home
Instead you actually issue commands by
holding down the microphone button on
the included remote the Google assistant
will handle queries like turn on the
living room lights what's on my calendar
or show everyone boring pictures from my
last vacation while think we'll handle
TV specific operations like changing the
picture mode adjusting the volume or
even turning off at the end of this
program now of course we can't show any
of that functionality because it doesn't
work in Canada just yet something about
the 49th parallel just makes
manufacturers not care about the people
north of it but that's a whole separate
conversation so then should you buy this
TV definitely maybe it's a beautiful set
that goes toe-to-toe with quantum dot
both in terms of quality and price
but then again LG has finally announced
that their cheapest OLED for 2018 the b8
which has the same features and
processor but of course that gorgeous
deep black OLED picture quality will be
just $2,100 making it three hundred
dollars cheaper than this super UHD that
is if you're willing to settle for fifty
five instead of sixty five inches the 65
inch version is
reground so that's an extra $600 my
advice if you're a movie watcher and
you're already spending this much OLED
is worth the upgrade but if you're a
gamer or someone who just watches the
news all day then I would probably save
your money and go super lead super let
super UHD speaking of super Squarespace
