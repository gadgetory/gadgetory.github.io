have ever looked at this is the drone
station high-performance DIY a IO that
is do-it-yourself all-in-one PC the
Corsair Flash Voyager go is the easy way
to move photos music and videos between
your Android device and your PC click
now to learn more
now given the weight of this thing the
packaging quite frankly doesn't really
inspire confidence it did arrive in one
piece but with a full system built in it
I'd be a little bit scared the exception
here is the styrene like plate Armour
piece that goes in front of the LCD
panel that is attached via a reusable
strap to the rest of the system the
monitor would likely be fine even if
every single other part of it died in
the shipping process now even though
this is an AI oh it's a product that
really embraces the do-it-yourself
spirit so the first thing to do with it
is build a standard ATX computer inside
it with the parts of my choice the
handles are very robust and ergonomic so
even though it's large and very heavy
it's got those so you can lift it and
move it around to a table where you can
work the user manual which I've
misplaced but don't worry about it it's
good trust me is uncharacteristically
really good I mean this is where I
usually expect a lesser-known company
like a IO to falter but the English and
it is excellent is got guidelines for
component selection some best practices
and a pretty complete step-by-step build
guide a plus right there for the manual
taking the drone station apart reveals
all the interior wiring that passes
through from the inside computer to the
front or rear of the outer shell
Ethernet and a single power connector
that handles both the monitor and the PC
come out the back and then the front has
two USB 2.0 ports two fan controllers
monitor controls headphone and
microphone jacks two USB 3.0 ports and
then finally power and reset switches
topped off with a couple of five and a
quarter
range Bay's that can be populated by
actually screwing an optical drive or
something else into the bottom of the
chassis inside a one quick note about
the fan controller is that you can run
the fans on the left and the right side
at either 1/3 2/3 or full speed and they
are controlled independently with those
two switches now the inside chassis once
removed is a fairly bog standard PC case
with a couple of modifications so
there's no front plastic bezel because
that would just take up unnecessary
space inside there's some mesh over
where the five and a quarter inch bays
would be there's a hole cut in the back
to interface with the outer shell and
then a repositioned a toolless drive
cage in the top for your three and a
half inch bays and then finally a two
and a half inch bake age that takes four
drives in the bottom four SSDs now the
drive cages are functional but I don't
think I would trust them in shipping or
even if someone who isn't as careful as
me with my PC we're handling it they are
not reinforced in any way which isn't a
problem for the SSDs but four hard
drives can be a major concern because
they're actually quite heavy the PCI
slots in the back really took me you
know back to the good old days of PC
building but unfortunately not really in
a good way I had to pry them out
something I've cut my hands doing enough
times to be upset that I had to do it
and their tool list design just isn't
very good tooless PCI remains a bit of a
holy grail of case design because most
of them don't work and the drone station
is no exception they didn't work with my
dual slot graphics card but it gets
worse because unlike most of the ones
I've encountered in the past the tool is
hold downs cannot be unscrewed and
removed you would actually have to drill
out the rivets so I had to force a screw
into my graphics card from a weird angle
in order to get it in there oh well the
good news here is that the case easily
accommodates a 7990 graphics card which
is about as big as a consumer graphics
card can get and so now all that remains
is to find out if we can cool it the
fans in the outer shell are controlled
by those switches as I mentioned before
but the included fans in the chassis so
there's two in the top there need to be
plugged into your mother
bored fortunately they have such long
leads that you could reach a suitable
software-controlled header on almost any
motherboard overall the build process
was painless enough I didn't end up
cutting myself which was nice and
there's no real cable management to
speak of but at least it has a CPU
cutout for easier mounting and there
wasn't really anything unexpected inside
so we're not completely back to the Dark
Ages or anything like that it was easy
enough
once the PC is assembled you'll hook up
all the wires and slide it inside the
the plastic outer shelf it fits in there
pretty snugly and you can see now how
the cooling strategy is supposed to work
so there are removable dust filters in
place and then the left side is intake
and the right side is exhaust the top is
also exhaust all in all looking at this
strategy whether you're running on low
or high on those fans it should be able
to handle almost anything in there
without overheating with the PC in place
you close the very DIY you know bought
these at the hardware store feeling
butterfly latches and you're pretty much
ready to go on inspection though the
latches aren't the only homemade looking
thing about the outside of the drone
station the finish is quite imperfect in
some places and the window on the back
doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me
even with the LED lighting and even if I
took the off the side panel of the PC
inside I mean it's there but it seems
very very optional maybe they have
another option coming in the future
where it'll make more sense but yeah I
don't want all of bad stuff though to
take away from the strength in the key
areas like the handles and the fact that
once it's closed up it doesn't feel like
it's going to come apart or anything so
while the fit and finish might not be
perfect it's solid enough that I'd be
confident having my PC inside when I
first fired up the actual PC I
immediately noticed that even though I
didn't get the 120 Hertz premium monitor
option the screen has a surprising
amount of color depth and very strong
viewing angles for a TN panel
I wish they'd offer an IPS option or
even a VA option but if I'm going to be
stuck with a TN monitor I'm glad it's at
least a pretty strong one
and all of this leads us to actually
sitting in front of the thing using it
in actual use the angle of the monitor
which is slightly angled back is better
in my estimation than the Krait computer
high performance gaming AIO that we
checked out recently but has the same
disadvantage as the Krait in that it's
not adjustable at all so you would need
to actually angle or elevate your entire
PC to change it the five and a quarter
inch bays are a nice touch even though
I'm unlikely to want an optical drive it
gives a lot of expansion flexibility
even if you're not sure if you're going
to need it so you know you could put
something like you know fan control I
mean you've already got fan controller
fan controllers or card readers stuff
like that in there so I think that is a
definite plus for it
in practice I didn't find it very
appealing to plug my keyboard and mouse
into the very front of my PC and
unfortunately the drone station doesn't
have any side or rear ports at all other
than that Ethernet port in the back and
the power plug in the back but it does
have one redeeming feature and that is
if you don't mind routing the wires
through a gap in the outer shell you can
actually plug in stuff that you never
want to remove internally to the back of
the inner chassis and then leave those
front ports open and then just have the
wire snake out the only issue there is
that if you ever need to pull that thing
out for some reason you actually need to
take the back off of your a i/o in order
to do it and if you have a mouse like my
old one that used to from time to time
just need to be unplugged and plug back
in that'll get real old real fast all
right so I talked a lot about the
cooling but I haven't talked
temperatures yet now I intentionally
loaded this thing up with a radio and HD
7990 one mother of a hot graphics card
and I was actually very pleased with the
results at about 45% fan speed max on
that card we reached 80 degrees and we
were bouncing between 950 and a thousand
megahertz on the course in our stress
testing staring into the fire in Far Cry
3 the core i5 CPU maxed out at around 80
degrees with an aftermarket cooler
master cooler on it also in that gaming
scenario so all in all there isn't too
much
me to say about the drone station it
performed very well in the areas where I
expected it to and that is cooling it
performed well in areas where I didn't
expect it to like the LCD on the front
and I understand where they're going
with all of this I mean it's an
all-in-one that's fully upgradable
easily capable of housing the latest
gaming components and has you know
rugged handles on it for easy transport
but the overall product feels more like
an interesting experiment rather than
something that I would actually spend a
thousand dollars on the inner chassis
needs to be prop more properly
integrated and more robustly built for
that to happen you can see that putting
the kind of pressure on the graphics
card that might occur during transport
flexes the motherboard tray and the rear
panel of that case in a way that I found
quite unsettling and the fit and finish
of the outer shell needs to be better to
command such a price tag for what is
essentially a case and a monitor with
nothing else really included I could be
wrong though in all of this guys if
you're looking at this going - totally
doesn't get it I want to hear from you
in the comments tell me what you'd use
it for a PC was a 24 inch monitor
integrated into it you can put basically
any hardware you wanted to I mean please
go ahead and argue your case I want it I
want to know if you guys think I'm
totally wrong about this anyway guys
thank you for watching my a a drone
station DRN stn I'm assuming it's
pronounced on station review like and
share this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it I promise that
that won't hurt my feelings in any way
in fact I love getting your feedback
leave a comment on the video either here
or in the Linus tech tips forum which is
linked in the video description if you
want to discuss this product or you have
constructive criticism for me and my
team if you have no constructive
criticism and you thought the video was
perfect then there's no pressure but the
video description also has a support
link with options to buy t-shirts give
us a monthly contribution or even just
give us a kickback when you buy random
junk on Amazon so we'd love it if you
did any of that stuff as well check it
out if you enjoy our videos it helps us
out a whole lot oh and as all
please don't forget to subscribe - tech
tips more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos although now that I come
to think of it we haven't done an
unboxing in over six weeks and I don't
think anyone noticed
