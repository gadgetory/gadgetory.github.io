there's Dominator GT memory and now you
think it includes a fan but I'm actually
not 100% sure so let's get to unboxing
this this is a four gig kit and it's i-5
ready so that means that Corsair has
optimized it for operation with the i-5
and the LGA 1156 i7 so here we go here's
the the Dominator GT airflow fan but
let's have a look at the modules first
so like all Dominator GT modules you can
see that we've got a black heat spreader
with a red top piece on top so it looks
very very sharp once it's installed in
your system so again the black white and
red theme on the back it's a very very
needy and actually of all things and
then the other one is again of course
identical so let's have a look at the
included fan this is the DHX + airflow
GT get this baby open
so this clips to the sides of your of
your dinner slots and then it installs
right over top of your memory like that
it's got a little sleeved three pin
connector there you can see these are
260 millimeter fans and apparently
they're a lot quieter than the old
actually well they are a lot quieter
than the older style round fans that was
fun quite fast and we're actually quite
loud they were only 40 millimeter so
here's your mounting hardware so you've
got a four screws which you use to mount
these right about here so there you go
you just screw them in from the top and
then the clips are on the side those
mountains have eclipsed for retaining
the memory modules on your motherboard
and there you have you've installed the
Dominator GT airflow fan anyway thank
you for checking on my blog and of
course there's Dominator GT modules</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
