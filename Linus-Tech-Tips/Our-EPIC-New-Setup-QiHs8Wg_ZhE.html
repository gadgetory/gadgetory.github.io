to happen because normally we take
forever with projects like where the
heck is six workstations one CPU am i
right anyway the walls are up the
electricals in the powers in the
ceilings painted the light fixtures are
coming in the lmg employee lounge is
coming together and sponsored by samsung
we will actually be outfitting as
completely as we can today the first
corner of it this is going to be the
big-screen gaming big screen content
corner and this all thanks to Samsung
who sponsored this video inside this
crate is a what is it 75 inch TV can it
handle it
I think it can it's pretty nailed
together and they're an 950 this is
their top-of-the-line sound bar so we're
gonna rip this thing open get it
installed get some couches going you
ready
so we have more than just Jake to help
us today actually
Yvonne's gonna be joining us because
she's been doing all of the like
knick-knack and interior decorating
shopping why was there too
we want the you're taking too long
who puts a crate together with nails all
right yeah that's about enough of that
you know what these are the tools I was
given Jake okay this is super dangerous
let's oh gosh
yeah just drops it on himself
we just tip it over oh my gosh I'm in
here I got this it's all good are you
standing on the soundbar no no I was not
anymore 512 Watts 17 built-in speaker
seven point one point four set this at
most not those number
Oh what else we got here 4k pass-through
we're professionals why are you guys
holding it sideways I wanted to read
this bag has handles wow this is way
easier with the handles okay okay hello
that's what I said earlier so you're
good now you can go straight just let go
it's fine I'm right I'm on the bubbles
what could go wrong see Wow with your
Samsung TV comes a free Linus don't
scratch the floor don't dry it on the
floor
I'm just dragging it lightly on the
floor just leaves a giant scratch oh
that's good that's good
is this the coffee table yeah I thought
we agreed on something like foldable and
easy to stow away yeah how much did we
spend did we spend 300 on this cuz the
one that I wanted was 300 you like 300
on a coffee table
that's stupid it was that we bought well
it doesn't fall for $300
hang up out of the way yes look at the
metal feet you can hang it from the
metal feet fine okay where's the TV set
over there in pieces so do you want to
take the TV out while I build this sure
ow ow I literally just paid him to do
that let's lift this up a little more I
mean this is really intended to be done
by two people but so I am pretty excited
about this TVs big it's quantum dots
whoa oops what did you just draw and it
has free sink I didn't break it can i
push you over now
like the crate that would actually be
very uncomfortable in this case so this
is Samsung's one connect box this allows
all the i/o and I think even power then
they've got this little tiny cable
okay the connector is big but the cable
itself is so thin that carries all the
signaling data for the display and power
isn't that incredible power love this
thing y'all you already put all the
Delavan hey why is that one sticking out
so far
Jake have you ever seen a TV stand piece
that there's like cable management built
into this thing are you putting a stand
on it it's going on the wall it is yes I
love these handling strips they have on
their TVs though that is so handy why
are you guys using an impact driver for
that it's cheap furniture that's a bad
idea and you know it Jake he's not even
the right amount of holes on the other
side okay well you can just take it
apart now
whoopsies gonna go Jake that wasn't even
me I said it was okay yes but only after
she like made me think it was the right
one
deceptive marketing so I'm basically set
up on the TV here I'm a little bit ahead
of those guys so at first I actually
thought it came with two subwoofers but
that that would be that would be stupid
nobody does that and what it actually is
is the sound bar itself and then it
comes with a rear wireless speaker kit
that not only fires forward or well I
mean forward towards you the user so
backwards towards the TV I don't it
doesn't matter but it also fires upward
so that's part of how they're achieving
the whole atmos and DTS X compatibility
thing so that's probably also why if you
look up Samsung insisted that we do this
video somewhere with a ceiling right
because we were initially gonna do the
lounge on that side and they were like
that's not a great idea the more you
know this thing isn't aligned you can
assembled this David okay I have like
super mangled this do you believe that
we might be about to have a bit of a
challenge here though what's wrong well
our stand is the thickness of the TV oh
it's just right wrong what do you mean
wrong right is the sound bar go so here
it is two HDMI inputs and then we've got
HDMI to the TV out with audio return
channel so that way we only have to have
just the one cable and we can use a
single remote for both of them all
things that I learned last time now
that is a big fat no oh so do we need to
wall mount the TV we do like what is
this well this isn't man kV you wanted
purple accents Jake actually picked this
out himself you're not proud no what is
this that doesn't belong in a man cave
where's the like Darth Vader mask that
hangs on the wall and has glowing red
eyes look that's gonna be on that side
you wanted Darth Vader there he is I
actually had to convince Jake to buy
this so you remember how you told me
that there's supposed to be fluorescents
in the ceiling and then light fixtures
what you told me not to do I did not say
you know it's because I didn't know that
he wanted both I thought he just like I
thought we were either they're gonna do
fluorescent orders here well anyway I
put him bulbs and then I went and I
turned off all the lights and it is dark
it's dim as hell in here you're not
gonna be able to play ping-pong in this
light no but they're like a light over
for the single-rate ah
Tyler do you feel like the lighting
they're providing too is suitable here I
can see well enough in this light yes
then why do you need those glasses yeah
didn't pay him before this at all you
two just have no idea what you're doing
I mean the good news is you guys did a
fantastic job of getting this set up I
think
are we ready to try this out mostly the
TV's on the wall there's a box there Wow
Wow
can you notice I think I scratched the
floor yeah I got it pretty good there so
that goes through that super thin wire
and then this goes to our sound bar
right that's basically all we need cuz
we can plug our console into either this
or the sound bar oh oh I can do appeal
how much did we pay for this driftwood
like four dollars or something
Wow weak weak peel game also do you like
our decorations better now this doesn't
seem very mancave II what's not supposed
to be yeah yeah okay so how do we
install this we got our TV box plugged
in yeah that's plugged into the TV got
so the Xbox can go into our sound bar
man this thing is heavy like it's thick
oh the end 950 is the most premium model
in Samsung soundbar line up and is the
only sound bar on the market but offers
realistic Dolby Atmos 7.1 point for
surround audio when you pair it with
their Wireless rear speakers which are
unique to the end 950 these speakers
have special upward firing drivers that
bounce off the ceiling that allow them
to work in unison with the standard side
firing drivers and the sound bar itself
in order to achieve these four top
speaker channels and offer a more
multi-dimensional audio experience the
end 950 was also born out of a
collaboration with Harman Kardon where
there over 65 years of audio expertise
along with Samsung software engineering
came together to create the ultimate
immersive sound bar experience just to
be clear to our viewers this Xbox is
here because we want to show off like
the media playback capabilities there
will absolutely be a gaming tower just
like chill in here let me just slide
that back there and boom no it's pretty
good yeah I mean we have to do some
touch-ups yeah here obviously but do we
can we just turn it on now I think so I
got the remote theoretically is that how
this works
oh hey all right where's our stuff did
we plug that in no we forgot okay oh so
we could Mel well mount the sound bar
yeah I don't think we should so how does
it wall mount is it flush or does it
stick out so it's basically flush if we
ever decided it's like I don't know a
centimeter away from the wall so we can
decide that later okay I should take
this off this looks really stupid how's
that mount treating you there but
oh that's hard to watch full peal oh
yeah well the colors throw thought wow
that is the biggest peel I have ever
done I want to wear this peel I like
that flourish there where do you want to
put this up I'm just beside me I guess I
love how the terms and conditions are
all in English so what do we have
plugged in why did you plug the Xbox
into the sound bars and this one to the
TV and then the TV and the soundboard
communicate it can do that it doesn't
matter oh okay so like smart guys okay
let's try that again
for me it was that same minute power
right okay we finished setting up the
sound bar because we've got the
subwoofer to make sure is working and
then we've got the rear speakers to pair
135 250 degrees using the remote control
I think we can figure that out
stalling the wall mount the subwoofer
and surround speakers will connect to
the sound bar automatically if they're
plugged in to electrical outfits oh
outlets oh well they're already blue are
they blinking neuron they're just on
perfect so then we're good to go is that
an electric couch yeah do you need a
pillow - this is basically a bad yeah
it's pretty great right
oh the bass is working well the stuff is
working yeah oh yeah it's just subtle
it's not that loud right now oh my could
be what is this exactly I hate games now
it's like you just want to play the game
in there like oh oh here's a loop box go
away
you have to sign in yeah yeah you know
that's normal
so you can save your progress what
button do i press to go I don't know
sure thing here back
all right
the rear speakers are really cool so
they're angled and then they're tuned in
software to bounce off the ceiling and
the walls in a given space to mimic a
much more complicated and more expensive
surround setup really excited to check
these out you got to be over here for us
to have the surround experience so this
is this is it you ready this is the
pinnacle of modern engineering right
here other than Billy bass
I can see why they like this demo
because whenever you get anything moving
across the screen is like yeah yeah but
it feels like there could be speakers
it's like over there yeah
yeah we were at like 30% volume so crazy
so massive continuity error obviously
the couch has arrived but Samsung sent
us over one more clip to try and of
course we've got our new couch proper
couch game going on man this is too good
this is ridiculous oh wow it's like it's
like a bed alright here we go this is
the full experience here
have you seen this movie no I have an
actual oh I haven't either
you can't really tell like at what
direction they're coming from like the
guys that are coming up from the right
you can hear it coming from that side
and that's the clip that's quick that's
awesome
yeah atlas man we're gonna have to leave
this here we're gonna have to leave it
here of course we're leaving it here
what this is this is part one of the
lounge part one's like part three this
is yeah part two actually this place is
gonna be awesome
yeah and we don't even need more light
so I guess all that's left now aside
from making another joke about
continuity and the leather couches being
back is to thank Samsung again for

Kardon sound bar that we featured today
