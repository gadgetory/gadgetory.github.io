a very different sort of unboxing set
the Keisei rpm watch from Tokyo flash
Japan so this is actually my second time
having a look at one of their watches
here is the shipping container that it's
arrived in there's some like packing
foam and stuff but other than that not
much of interest here they shipped me
two watches one of which I'm going to
unbox now and the other one has an
embargo date that we're gonna have to
take a look at later so I'm gonna get
the camera to come in and have a close
look at the unboxing so the first thing
you're gonna notice about Tokyo Flash's
website it is is it is very sort of
flashy and exciting their watch designs
are very unique so - - at first glance
it's very difficult to tell the time on
a Tokyo flash watch because they don't
have traditional sort of hand
minute-hand
our hand second hand kind of thing going
on they all have sort of cool LED
displays so it comes with a little
manual comes with a foamy okay just to
protect the top of the watch then the
watch itself like I said this is my
second there we go I accidentally turned
it on but either way that that's cool
this is my second watch that I've
encountered from them so I'm not that
surprised this time at the overall solid
feel it's a stainless steel watch so the
the pricing is sort of in line with what
you might expect from a stainless steel
watch so we're talking watches that cost
sort of in the hundreds or a couple
hundreds as opposed to watches that cost
you know thousands like what you might
find at a jewelry store where they're
made of gold or silver or whatever else
in terms of included accessories there's
oh I just dropped something
ah there we go so there's a couple of
things number one is that included
screwdriver this is actually for opening
up the charging port so you didn't want
to keep that handy sort of next to your
computer or wherever else you're using
charge it at charges by USB so you just
plug in the USB port to something that
provides five volt power plug this into
the watch and it charges and then it
does come with an extra plug just in
case you do happen to lose
this one I would recommend keeping it
plugged it does have a little rubber
seal on it so it'll just help keep the
watch protected an event that and the
event that a little bit of moisture gets
on it or whatever else the case may be
so let's go ahead and take the plastic
off here so this is actually the first
design from tokyo flash japan that has
been inspired by one of their fan
created sort of concepts and then
brought to life by their team so I think
that's really really cool
that they thought they'd do that sort of
thing and right now I'm having a little
bit of trouble with this plastic wrap
which is causing me know a small amount
of stress because I'm trying to unbox it
so let's just fold it around the entire
wristband itself so that it doesn't get
scratched in transit you know I'm just
have to do this on camera
sorry about that guys I finally got it
so it's an extremely extremely shiny
finish under there which is yeah very
very shiny okay I hope you guys can get
a good look at that you got okay and
then the last bit of protective plastic
is here on the back of the watch where
they've got their rpm rpm branding
what's it's a 3d something what what
three atmospheres water-resistant okay
cool three point six volt rechargeable
USB rechargeable battery only cool stuff
okay so resizing resizing can be a bit
of a bear with watches but I did figure
out how to do it last time they sent a
watch over this one it looks like I'll
have to remove about two links whenever
you're resizing the watch you want to
make sure that you remove equally from
both sides so that you don't end up with
the buckle sort of over on sort of the
side of your wrist or anything like that
the way to read the time on this watch
is actually fairly straightforward once
you get the hang of it so it's logical
if you think about it this way the inner
ring of LEDs which is actually magnified
by a lens that sits over top of them
around the the stainless steel
centerpiece
it's kind of a brushed finish can you
see that okay so the inner part which
would be the shorter hand if you were to
think of it in terms of watch hands is
the ours so this one right here is set
right now two one two three four five
six seven eight nine nine hours so it is
nine and then the outer ring of LEDs is
minutes so nine hours and 15 minutes
they're in increments of 5 5 10 15 then
these guys right here that are flashing
are another incremental or in the
incremental minutes so the fact that
three of them were flashing means it is
918 at the time of reading this one
which it isn't but you can't really
expect a watch to be set to the correct
time when it arrives especially if you
buy it from Japan and you don't live in
Japan so we're gonna do give me a couple
minutes here we're going to resize it
and then we'll get you guys some shots
of it sort of on the on the wrist here
now the sizing process is pretty simple
you can see I've already removed one
full link from one of the sides and I'm
in the midst of removing another link
all you got to do is I was able to
fashion myself a tool out of a paperclip
so I just use my trusty snippers cut
very thin piece of metal then what you
do is you take that straight thin piece
of metal you line it up on the edge of a
table and give it kind of a whack now
there's arrows on the inside of the
wristband that indicate which way the
pins come out see the the arrows here so
the pins that are in the watch come out
the only go in one way so they have kind
of a ball at the end of one of the sides
so they just kind of slide in and slide
out this way so you give it a whack with
something preferably smaller than this
make sure it's lined up straight pull
out the pin then you pull out your tool
there we go and which I've now bent but
it's okay I can always make myself
another one then what you do is you take
out these pieces that you no longer need
hmm lime the watch back up with
something to bear in mind guys very very
very important is that you don't want to
take out the very the very last link in
either on either side because it's
real bear to put those ones back
together unless you're you know you
definitely need all of us so it's always
a good idea to do a quick sort of
approximation of what you think the
sizing is gonna be like before you go
ahead and put the links back in I'm just
gonna flip it back together here and
look at the monitor so basically this is
what the watch looks like you just press
the button to read the time as we showed
you guys before it only flashes for sort
of a couple moments and then it will
actually turn off in order to conserve
power which is great because you got to
charge it when it runs out of power now
I removed three links at the end and I
should probably take one more out it's
still a little bit loose but we we did
sort of put it all back together and
then we're trying to don't so make sure
you keep the extra links as well as the
pins that you removed in a safe place
