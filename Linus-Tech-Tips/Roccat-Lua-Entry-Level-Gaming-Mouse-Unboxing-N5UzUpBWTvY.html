the rocket lua which is their sort of
entry level gaming mouse and i would
like to invite a special guest to come
and show us his matching shirt which is
also blue and black
check out my swag you know what else is
into your level wow he just used my own
burn on me and it was it was effective
nonetheless so there you go
goes to show you the quality of my of my
burn techniques which is guys the only
burn that there is absolutely no
comeback for it's just to add your face
to anything so yeah it works every time
always successful and and and no one no
one can counter it so so the russian
turn turned that around on me there
anyway what do we have to say about this
guy it's an optical mouse so it goes
anywhere from two hundred and fifty to
two thousand DPI with seven intermediary
steps and the dextrous v-shape means
it's right and left-handed compatible
however i don't know of too many even
left-handed folks who use their mouse
with their left hand for gaming i think
the vast majority of them i mean
especially back in the days when the
only really the only real gaming mice
were were logitech's mice and they were
all right-handed shaped i mean that was
what i think everyone got used to well I
guess we better just do it this way I
mean that in the WASD keys with all the
other functionality you can't really use
the arrow keys with your right hand and
I mean you could use the the number pad
but then you're an awfully it's an
awfully wide Stu anyway I think the
left-handed gamers know why they are
generally using their left hands quick
installation guide is included so there
you go you can use your product serial
number to register it also comes with
some sweet stickers so like there's like
an eye rocket hey that's actually kind
of clever alright
arctic blue LED lighting no sweat side
grips an advanced driver for customized
gaming you know what
because rocket hasn't had much of a
presence in North America my incorrect
assumption was that like many sort of
gaining
referral companies that sort of release
a product and the product itself looks
great but then the software is just a
terrible outsourced mess I assumed that
their software wasn't going to be good
it was very complete when I checked it
out on the what was it the Konex TD as
well as their SQ keyboard so it's got
tons of features and actually works
unlike a lot of the software that's out
there so if I can get my camera to come
in a little bit closer I want to show
you guys the mess up close as well as
the shape and size a little bit so
there's not a ton of buttons personally
I'd like to see a forward and a back
button on any Mouse these days because
it makes such a big difference in the
day-to-day use of your computer when
you're you know browsing the internet or
whatever else but the finish on it is
quite nice so they're no sweat side grip
is not quite like a rubberized coating
but it's more of a textured plastic that
will be a little bit more resistant to
that slick oily feeling and also allows
you to easily pick up the most without
accidentally activating any other
buttons mind you the fact that there
aren't any buttons on the sides makes
that a bit of a loop point anyway the
only real buttons you have are left
right click little click as well as your
dpi adjust button and the size of the
mouse is quite small you can see that
even compared to me like I would
actually recommend this particularly if
you wanted someone whose hand is going
to fit perfectly for someone like a
younger kid you know maybe you're a 11
year old nephew or whatever else where
you still got kind of smaller narrower
hands or for the girl gamers out there
who have narrower hands and more slender
hands because for me I'm kind of
spilling over it on the sides and I do
have quite small hands and I can't quite
palm grip this one so you can see if I
try to palm grip it my fingers are going
to go right over the edges so it would
be more of a claw type of play for me
and then again I have I have quite small
hands on the bottom you find your your
sliding feet which are quite thick and
feel very robust so they haven't skimp
there and then there's the optical mm
dpi laser right there so that'll pretty
much do it for this unboxing thank you
for checking it out and don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos and I did miss one thing this guy
right
your glows blue and it can pulsate and
stuff which is kind of neat
very cool lighting effect on most of the
rocket gear that we've checked out
before so I realize now I did say that I
was going to show you guys what the
pulsating blue LED lighting looks like
they do such a good job of their
lighting effects like you don't really
see any hot spots or like zones where
the lighting is is more rich than others
so it looks quite nice and it's got like
that nice breathing effect to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
