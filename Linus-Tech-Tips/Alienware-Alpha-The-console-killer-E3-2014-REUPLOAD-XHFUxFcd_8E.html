alright guys I'm here at Alienware with
Frank and he's gonna tell us all about
the Alienware alpha what is your
favorite thing about this machine
favorite thing about the machine is just
the size I mean look at how incredibly
small this system is and the performance
is just unbelievable on this machine so
we're featuring a Intel Haswell based
Core i3 Core i5 and core i7 processor so
we got dual core and quad core first
configuration the entry configuration of
this is gonna have 4 gigabytes of memory
on it and it'll have a 500 gig hard
drive and it's gonna come bundled with
an Xbox 360 gamepad for $549 but you'll
also be able to go up the two terabytes
of hard drive space if you want on this
product you can get quad core i5 and i7
processors if you want on here you go to
eight gigs of memory all of them going
to come with a custom Maxwell based
Nvidia graphics chip that we designed
with Nvidia for this product and each of
the grant one and the graphics will have
two gigabytes of gddr5 memory dedicated
to it that's awesome and while it might
not be designed for it due to very very
very small form-factor in comparison to
even the next gen consoles that we have
you can upgrade this thing correct you
can upgrade it correct pretty much
everything is upgradeable on here except
for the graphics chip the graphics chip
was again custom designed with between
Nvidia and us so it's built into the
motherboard of the product but if you
want to change out your hard drive you
want to change your memory you want to
change your CPU even your Wrentham or I
said a ram or even your wireless card
they're all interchangeable on here we
didn't design it so it could be easily
upgradable like we do on all of our
other desktops we designed this to be
really small really efficient and to be
a product that you could put in your
living room and under your TV but
there's nothing that's in here that
prevents you from upgrading it if you
wanted to do so I think our guys will
take that challenge I don't think
they're too worried now it's it's not
going to be steamos ready because steam
OS is not ready but what is this going
to ship with in terms of operating
system right so steam OS and the steam
gamepad are delayed until next year so
we're going to be we're shipping it
beyond this year before the end of the
year using Windows but we put a custom
GUI on top of Windows that will give you
a full console experience so it will not
ship with a keyboard and mouse it will
only ship
with the Xbox 360 gamepad if you have
Xbox 360 game pads already you can
attach them to this box you don't have
to reinvest in new game pads with this
which is really cool and it'll be fully
navigable the entire OS experience will
be fully navigable with the gamepad if
you want to use it as a desktop PC and
use a keyboard and mouse you can
absolutely do that as well we're open
we're flexible we're not telling you
what you can't do you can do anything
you want with this box we're just giving
you the option to use it as a game pad
only solution if you want to do so now
if someone is interested in steamos if
they pick this up now it's going to come
with Windows and they'll be able to
upgrade this later correct absolutely so
one steamos is finally out or if you
want to load the beta you absolutely can
load it on this system will not void
your warranty by any means well support
it will even help you do it if you need
instructions on how to do it
steamos also works with the Xbox 360
gamepad it also works with the Logitech
gamepad and a few others so this is our
steam OS ready exactly I know a lot of
guys out there were a little bit
hesitant when they first started hearing
about these pre-built steam OS boxes
coming out or in this case the Windows
OS box because they're like oh why don't
I build my own this has a compelling
value due to stuff like form factor and
price which is actually very impressive
so thanks for showing me this today
I got to go on and check out more things
on the show if you guys want to see all
