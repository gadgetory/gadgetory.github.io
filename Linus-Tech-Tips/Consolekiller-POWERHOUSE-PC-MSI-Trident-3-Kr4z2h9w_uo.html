has been solely occupied by well
consoles but I say no more this right
here is exactly what I have been asking
for for literally years so you can watch
me gushing about it at CES here but can
it live up to my expectations
well I hope so I hope we'll have a new
living room King today the msi trident 3
synergy is the amazing software that
lets you share your mouse and keyboard
between multiple computers check it out
now at the link in the video description
the Trident 3 comes in slightly bigger
than the ps4 at 4.7 1 liters though in
fairness the ps4 also has an internal
power supply and much smaller than the
original ex bone so it easily fits under
an arm and it comes with a cloth bag so
you don't have to worry about scratches
if you want to cart it around to a
friend's house or to a LAN party it does
have a mild case of the gamer aesthetic
but the only really i grabbing aspect of
the industrial design IMO is the RGB
light on the front and in fairness to
msi i think trump signed an executive
order or something saying that all
gaming computers need RGB lighting so is
it really their fault
io is strong on the front you'll find
two USB Taipei's a USB C audio ports and
if you're into that sort of thing a
second HDMI out for VR then around the
back you'll have another 5 USB ports
Gigabit LAN microphone lining it out
DVI DisplayPort and a whopping 4 HDMI
ports though it should be noted one of
them is for the VR link at the front one
of them is for your monitor and the
other two are the input for the VR link
at the front and off the motherboard
itself which most people won't want to
use the specs of the
sigh trident 3 prove that the days of
mini pcs being only suitable for
productivity are over with its core i7
and gtx 1070 this thing should be able
to crush games at 1080p or 1440 though
as we've seen time and time again when
powerful components get crammed into a
small case thermals can quickly become
an issue
so we booted up i-264 and set the CPU
off to the races at normal room
temperature
the Trident 3 did get a little hot with
the CPU peaking at 92 degrees Celsius
but to its credit it never thermal
throttled or had to down clock so with
the powerful core i7 that's in there
the Trident 3 could survive video
rendering sessions or crunching
cosmology equations as long as you're
not doing it 24/7 the GPU cooling is
even more impressive during the firm arc
GPU stress test the powerful gtx 1070
version didn't even sweat reaching a max
temperature of 72 degrees Celsius and
remarkably the Trident 3 was able to
maintain these temperatures while
remaining virtually silent so good on
you MSI this doesn't tell us if it's
actually performing up to snuff though
so to test if the smaller case is an
issue we set up an identically SPECT
test bench and ran it alongside it and
from these tests we saw virtually no
difference between the Trident 3 and our
open-air bench with all our results
being within what I'd consider margin of
error let's talk about expandability now
typically not a strong point for these
tiny pcs and the motherboard is as
expected
non-standard meaning that you're stuck
with this basic platform for good there
is also some good news though the CPU
GPU and ram can all be easily swapped
with only the storage requiring a
complete disassembly in order to get at
it should be noted though if you're
going to upgrade the GPU your options
will be somewhat
limited so for the 1060 version of the
Trident 3 you will also have to upgrade
the power supply to the more powerful
330 watt version if you want to put in a
graphics card that sucks more juice
though if you have the 1070 version
which comes with that power supply you
might even be able to put in a
hypothetical future graphics card and
enjoy a nice FPS boost the included
keyboard and mouse look a little over
the top as do many gaming peripherals
these days again I think there was an
order but they are actually surprisingly
functional the mouse is comfortable in
the hand moves smoothly and accurately
and even has adjustable weights and
while the keyboard isn't mechanical it
was actually good enough to fool John
into thinking it was using Cherry MX
browns not quite sure how that happened
but I was also comfortable typing on it
at the very least so good on MSI for
bundling peripherals that we don't need
to immediately throw in the trap
recycling if I had to nitpick a bit it
does come with a lot of pre-installed
bloatware most of it is at least gaming
related or gaming version but it's still
annoying for a freshly booted computer
to prompt me to register for several
things that I didn't ask for and I don't
care about as for the inclusion of
Norton well I'm sure you all know how I
feel about that though maybe if they
included like a gaming version of Norton
it could just have one button uninstall
bottom line though is it worth it for
the msi Trident 3s compact size you'll
be spending around $200 more than you
would on an identical expect full-size
pre-built desktop that would be easier
to upgrade in the future and unless
you're very unlucky would have better
cooling with that being said unless
you're a single dude in college putting
a full-sized gaming desktop in your
living room probably won't fly making
the trine 3 a great way to get non
cinematic frame rates on your big-screen
it definitely gets a recommendation from
me do you like anime no really though do
you really like anime
then checkout crunchyroll they offer the
most current episodes of new shows

super and twin star exorcists and all of
the content on their site is
