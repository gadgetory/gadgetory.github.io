made my first Android phone I mean check
this out this is me with the One m7 so
shiny and exciting and then I like
probably many of you was disappointed by
HTC by their complacency their pricing
their customer service their build
quality basically insert reason not to
care anymore here the one m9 era marked
a particularly rough patch in the
Taiwanese company's history with
investors valuing it at less than the
cash it had in the bank I mean what I
mean what but more recently there's been
good news to the HTC vive is the VR
headset to get if that tall guy I hang
around with is to be believed he's not
dying
but HTC's core business is mobile phones
and that thing is not a phone so are
they ready to give up and just make
computer peripherals from now on
apparently not meet the HTC 10
to celebrate the launch of their Nitro+
radio on our X 480 sapphire is giving
some of them away learn more and enter
the giveaway at the link in the video
description the 10 like every other
flagship smartphone right now packs a
Snapdragon 820 CPU paired with an Adreno
530 GPU so performance should be pretty
much right in there with everyone else
assuming that the overheating issues
that the one m9 demonstrated in our
water-cooled phones video haven't made a
reappearance and it looks like we're in
ok shape here the iPhone 6s is the
golden standard and doesn't throttle in
my Geekbench repeatedly tests at all but
I consider anything around a 10 to 15
percent reduction in performance during
continuous heavy use to be very good the
10 falls well short of that mark a
surprise given its ample thickness but
it isn't something that I noticed day
today and at least it doesn't cut in
half like its predecessor also packed
into the tens aluminum frame is four
gigs of lpddr4 ram 32 or in some regions
apparently 64 gigs of storage and a
non-removable 3000 milliamp hour battery
that saw me through everyday during my
time with the device features that have
become shockingly standard fare in
recent times I mean it's not a knock
against the 10 it's a good thing it just
doesn't help it stand apart
let's get then to what does the screen
is a subtly curved corning gorilla glass
topped 5.2 inch Super LCD 5 affair
with a pixel count of 2560 by 1440
making it a solid choice for use in a VR
viewer like Google cardboard if you're
into that sort of thing nothing about
its viewing angles anti-reflective
Nisour colors popped out and in fact
while I didn't notice this in daily use
next to the galaxy s7 and the iPhone 6s
its display has a noticeable pink cast
something that neither switching from
vivid to srgb color mode nor adjusting
color temperature helped with so ok then
that was a lie the screen wasn't a
differentiating point below the screen
is
capacitive home button with a quick and
accurate integrated fingerprint sensor
flanked by two Hardware capacitive
buttons for a last application and back
that I wish could be swapped like on the
one plus three but that I otherwise
can't complain about the chin bar size
on the 10 was actually just perfect for
me to type totally naturally above the
screen isn't optically stabilized
5-megapixel selfie camera that does a
little more noise reduction
post-processing than I would personally
like but otherwise generated very good
results Apple really has some catching
up to do with their next-generation
selfie can and then finally an
exceptional feature gone is boomsound
dual front-facing speakers but here is
actually a replacement that I can't
believe no one else thought of the
earpiece speaker doubles as a
loudspeaker that combined with the
surprisingly directional bottom firing
speaker that handles more of the mid and
low frequencies delivers an
exceptionally balanced listening
experience
nice work HTC also on the bottom of the
10th is some dents from me dropping it
oops
the main microphone and a USB 3.1 gen2
on type C shaped port more on that in a
moment
but this is another pretty sweet feature
with the fast file transfer feature
enabled I was able to saturate the 100
and 150 megabyte write and read speeds
respectively of the internal storage
moving videos to and from a computer
this is great for offloading photos and
videos or loading media onto your device
before a trip unfortunately it doesn't
seem like you can set it to work this
way by default for reasons that are
beyond me but that I think may have to
do with the USB type C shaped port not
having been implemented in accordance
with the USB type-c standard Qualcomm
quick charge 3.0 variable voltage fast
charging prevents QC 3.0 Chargers from
operating at the same time that data
transfer is taking place
which makes one pluses - charge a4 amp 5
volt fast charging method look good for
reasons that go beyond keeping the phone
cooler during charging hmm on the left
of the device is a microSD slot for
expandable storage awesome and on the
right is the SIM tray the volume rocker
and a lock button that thanks to the
textured top is easy to differentiate
both in pocket and without the headphone
jack is on top in the middle and if it
sounds ridiculous the first time you
plug it in you're like put us all this
bass in my music turn off the Dolby
enhancement in the settings menu you're
welcome and then at the rear is a noise
cancelling microphone dual tone flash
laser autofocus and 12 megapixel rear
camera whose lower megapixel count hurts
under ideal well-lit conditions but
who's conservative denoising
post-processing optical image
stabilization and larger light scooping
pixels deliver some of the best
low-light performance I've seen these
images were taken under identical
lighting conditions with the s7 the 6s
and the 10 check out how well you can
read that text with the 10 and I'd say
for the most part camera control is a
really strong point to autofocus is
laser quick all the usual shooting modes
like 4k video raw stills or slow-mo are
there plus it's got this neat hyperlapse
mode that folks are going to have a lot
of fun with and the pro sliders all show
up on screen at the same time making it
really fast to adjust when manually
shooting I just wish it was a little
faster to open personally I mean the app
itself launches as quickly as anyone
else but HTC's implementation of gesture
control isn't the best I've seen the two
swipes down to open the camera is a
little flaky and only works when the
screen is off and this is a criticism of
everyone not just HTC but why can't I
reconfigure whichever gestures I want to
do whatever stuff I want anyway I still
like the scent skin including blinkfeed
and it's pretty close to stock Android
now so at this point all that's left is
for me to
drop the phone and deliver my conclusion
it feels like every other reviewer in
the world is declaring it to be a hit a
clinic on how to make a smart phone or
some other variation of the second
coming but I didn't come twice or even
once for that matter though it should be
noted that that is not because the HTC
ten is a bad phone it actually
remarkably doesn't seem to do anything
wrong it's just because it also doesn't
push the innovation envelope in any way
that's meaningful to me personally the
better speaker experience is going to
win over some buyers for sure but I'm
more partial to the waterproofness of
the s7 and the pressure-sensitive screen
and lightning fast performance including
wave to AC wireless at which everyone
else would implement that of the iPhone
6s maybe the problem though is that
phones are just kind of mature now the
last remaining huge gap in smartphone
functionality that Apple enjoyed the
camera has mostly been closed by the
Koreans the Chinese and now the
Taiwanese to the point where I feel like
a phone isn't so much stand out good as
stand out bad with anything else being
good but maybe that in itself is a good
thing maybe the fact that a solid phone
that performs well and feels good in the
hand in spite of its thicker design
doesn't excite me anymore it's just good
for buyers because that's what the HTC
10 is I personally still prefer the s7
but you might not and it's good to have
choice and you know what other choice is
good for consumers the choice of where
to put your D brand skin do you want to
put it on a laptop do you want to put it
on a phone do you want to put it on a
game console or a game controller well
that's up to you and you've got more
choices too if you head over to D brand
comm we've got that linked in the video
description you can use their fantastic
configurator
to configure your device whether it's
the you know touch pad of a laptop
versus the bottom or the top of it or
whether it's the back of a phone versus
the sides of the phone you can configure
pretty
to any surface on the device with any
color and any finish you want and you
can preview it in real time so you'll
know before you get it that it's going
to a fit great on your device because
all dbrand skins are precision cut and B
represent your personal style whether
your personal style is tasteful or
clown-like
I won't judge so again that's the link
to D brand calm in the video description
