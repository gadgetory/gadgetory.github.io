overview of the blackberry playbook but
I had not actually done an unboxing yet
so this is going to be pretty much
appear on boxing the blackberry playbook
comes in a variety of different
capacities this is a 32 gig version of
note is the fact that the PlayBook is
not expandable via SD SD card so you're
pretty much stuck with the capacity that
you have so that is something to bear in
mind although if you're anything like me
if you're using a tablet device you're
probably going to be accessing a lot of
your content over a network whether it
is the internet or whether it is your
home network I'm just going to use my
handy dandy multi-use NCIX 10 to break
the seal on here and we can have a look
there we go at the blackberry playbook
and what it includes all right so the
first thing we find inside the box is a
kind of neoprene sheath for the playbook
okay you can see the top of it is
accessible so you can at least reach
your play pause and volume buttons as
well as the power button so you do have
access to your media controls the next
thing you find inside is cryptically
hard to open make sure in an area with
Wi-Fi coverage there's your power button
press the power button follow the steps
on the screen this up here is to be some
kind of a quick start guide oh when it
comes with complimentary technical
support for 90 days after the day
scriptures alright available a few
different languages excited next we have
a piece of plastic and then we've got a
pretty slick-looking package this is
almost razor asked in terms of its style
and flair and its yield point of sealing
packages on the inside of the seal pack
I left my knife somewhere and I don't
have it on me at this so there is
another way to open packages you can
peel back the tape which I never do all
right in here we will find a USB data
cable you will also find a power cable
that plugs into the same USB data cable
jack
so you can either do just power or you
can do power and data I believe the
BlackBerry PlayBook charges off of your
computer if it can provide enough power
through the USB port it comes with a
cleaning cloth which says BlackBerry
PlayBook on it I don't know if you can
see that there you go now you can
alright and then also comes with safety
and product information booklet in a
variety of languages as well as limited
warranty alright so electrical safety
battery safety so pretty much there's
not a whole lot in terms of instructions
included with the BlackBerry PlayBook
let's have a look at the device itself
although if you want to have a more
thorough look at it I would recommend
checking out my other video okay so here
they explained the concept of dragging
your menus from the top and the bottom
of the screen depending what it is
you're trying to do see if we can turn
it on here I'm just going to remove the
screen protector removing screen
protectors is always fun I don't think
we've actually got enough charge to turn
it on I just tried to press the power
button I saw the light go on for a
second and then it oh maybe we do maybe
we do so we've got our blackberry logo
here the blackberry playbook as was
pointed out to me besides that you won't
hold on a second know that must not be
right then well whatever we've got our
stereo speakers here and here we'll do a
quick product or says 32 gig here
there's your USB port well okay no I
think that one is the micro HDMI there's
your USB port here's a few contacts for
a docking station okay moving around to
the other side we find nothing moving to
the top we find the media controls that
I showed you before as well as a
headphone and microphone jack moving
around to this side we find nothing it's
a very simplistic overall design on the
back you find your rear camera as well
as a blackberry logo and it's still
booting up so it seems to kind of take a
little while to boot up although as with
most tablets you shouldn't really be
booting it down all the way up on you
guys have a look at the viewing angle of
the screen it's actually here it's
really reflective so I'm going to stand
here so you can kind of see can you see
that you can still read the screen even
from that extreme angle very cool
and then I'm just gonna okay so you can
kind of see what it looks like from the
middle if swiped continue so here's the
set initial setup really it's that easy
so you just ok so I'm going to connect
to this which is an open wireless access
way to go cameraman swipe to continue
alright i can set the date and time
automatically i can use 24-hour time
here i'll do a little bit of setup and
then we'll come back guys so now we're
at a point in the set up process that i
should talk about that i did not talk
about in my product tour and that is the
blackberry ID bit basically unless you
have a blackberry your kind of locked
out of some of the functionality in
terms of the calendar like the built-in
calendar app as well as a couple other
things so that's the one kind of
disadvantages a lot of people have
talked about to do with the blackberry
playbook right now i don't have a
blackberry ID so we're probably not
going to finish booting this one up but
you guys can check out the usage video
in my other video and don't forget to
