on box it's a ram fan but it's a neat
looking one so everyone in their dog
seems to have a ram fan these days the
Corsair has one ocz has one and now
obviously take this stuff to me let go
let go this is not working very well
now obviously g.skill has one there we
go
ok so we'll get this box opened up and
have a look at this particular Ram fan
the reason I like this one is that it is
aesthetically I believe a little bit
stronger than the other ones on the
market even the cameraman who's like you
know all into the Mac aesthetic likes
this one ok so first of all we have a
fan ok so you can see that this is a
clear here we go 6 centimeter one ball
bearing 3500 rpm fence oh that's a 60
millimeter fan and it is sitting under
like a little like shuriken style grill
this is actually this this gray part is
actually kind of a rubberized grip 'part
so it has kind of a premium feel to it
also it doesn't use a cheesy mounting
system like so many of the other ones do
it just is it's a plastic piece it's got
little foam grippy things on the inside
can you see that cameraman yeah so it's
like pretty grippy there and then all
you do is you stretch it out a little
bit and you put it over your RAM slots
just like everyone else you seem to be
like fiddling around with little fun
screws and stuff I can't figure out why
so here why don't we go into the user
guide and have a look so step one
stretch out both sides of the fan module
step two buckle one side on step three
buckle the other side step four plug the
fans power connector into the 3-pin
connector on your mainboard
that was easy it has a one year warranty
and oh this is another thing that really
stands out everyone seems to think that
it's okay to use cheap crappy sleeving
on products it's not and so g.skill is
actually using a premium quality
sleeving check that out you can't see
any of the colour of the cable inside
even when you like move it around that
just looks like a black cable kudos to
g.skill for using a proper quality
sleeving on their product and i'm also
going to do a quick installation guide
in a classic case of linus totally
missing the point of demonstrating the
latest tech
ecology rather than showing it on
g.skill ripjaws memory which is what i
should probably be doing so you look how
good they go together so you've got that
like from the top kind of thing anyway
so I'm actually going to install this on
an ancient asrock motherboard for no
particular reason
so you stretch these out you clip on the
one side so you can see the little foamy
thing grips you stretch it out on the
other side clip it on and it's just like
that then you take your fan connector
and you plug it into some available fan
header it's that easy
and it can cover up to you know what
based on the spacing on this motherboard
I'd say it covers up to six dims fairly
comfortably on an average x58 board I
mean really you don't need a lot of
airflow on round anyhow so thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the g.skill
turbulence fan program</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
