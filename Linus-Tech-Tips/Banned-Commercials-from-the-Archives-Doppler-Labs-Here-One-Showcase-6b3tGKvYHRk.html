in a while a sponsor will approach us to
do a video for them we'll deliver it and
they will absolutely hate it and refuse
to pay
usually those videos end up lost in the
archives forever never to see the light
of day but today is a special day
because Doppler labs makers of the here
won and the agency that actually
contracted us to do this video you're
about to watch both either completely
went out of business or got acquired by
some other controlling interest
so then without further ado I present to
you band commercials from the archives
looking for an affordable and reliable
VPN private Internet access encrypts
your Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP check it out today through
the link below okay so here's the
problem it is impossible to get anything
done in here I put up this sign but the
only effect it seems to have is that
instead of people walking right in they
kind of point it the sine-wave at me and
then walk right in anyhow so clearly
something has to be done here
okay so now we've got earphones in so
this this is the isolation zone
okay so constructions done now the last
thing that's left then is to get
third-party independent validation of my
do not disturb zone
so Dennis you're first I'll just
summarize so what we've done is we've
added light blocking material to the
windows
we've added an acoustic dampening
material above the ceiling tiles in the
room to prevent sound bleeding and sound
reflections and around the monitor
itself we've added a foil blinder but
the one piece that we didn't you know
really have to install is these so these
are the Doppler labs here one noise
cancelling earphones
I think this sound might still be the
issue as you only put the thing on the
ceiling by the doors you can hear some
stuff like I can already hear my own
just talking it sounds like something is
happening up there or not happening as a
word so I'm optimistic okay yeah if I
think this set up of all this stuff that
you put around randomly in your office
is going to work ya know
so Dennis I'm just talking from like
right kind of next to on the other side
how would you describe the isolation no
I can't hear you
it sounds about the same it sounds about
the same thing here yeah I hear more
things okay
now point back in here okay Dennis how's
the isolation I can't steer here you you
can still hear me okay well I can hear
you less cuz you're outside it sounds
like there's a wall between the two of
us did you turn it on yeah would you do
would you say the results are kind of
disappointing all that's fine because
this is the kind of the haha moment
the last ingredient of the whole
solution is actually the most important
in my hand here rare earth magnets what
these are are incredibly strong magnets
here try it try and peel it off see
anyway they're really strong magnets oh
yeah so they're definitely rare earth
magnets by positioning them around you I
should be able to have an effect on what
you hear okay what I'm serious
is it because the magnetic field thing
I'm gonna put one of them here one of
them goes behind the monitor but out of
your line of sight can you see this I
can okay
how about now no I can't okay if I talk
like this do you hear any difference I
don't know if I can tell nothing okay
check the angle here okay I'm gonna put
it right here
the last one is the one behind your head
so if I were to move behind your head do
you hear a difference holy wait do you
like do you hear a difference okay hold
on okay hold on just a second is that
better or worse worse okay uh yeah it
sounds like the ambient noise as you did
that really went down the wall so I'm
moving closer towards you I'm moving
closer towards you and now I'm touching
the back of your head can you hear it
yes oh wow I feel like I can't hear you
like budge I'm bringing it back around
it's quiet again and very quiet now oh
wow
is it working okay hold on a second I'm
gonna move it away from your head okay
I'm moving it around in front can you
can you hear me better or worse okay I'm
gonna move it back around your head oh
yeah what if I told you that the magnets
for both know what the whole way no it
actually works cute what's actually
happening is I am turning the real world
up and down with the headphones I can
even amplify it can you hear me even
louder too much okay okay so that's more
comfortable - 22 dB
so basically in real time these things
listen to the world around you and they
change what you hear
it actually has a microphone on the
outside a DSP so digital signal
processor or sound processor and then it
has balanced armature drivers inside so
what it's doing is it's actually taking
the world around you altering it or
removing or adding so you hear that
right now and then re broadcasting it
into your ears holy so you can actually
even do like live EQ so I could I could
add a bunch of bass they've got balanced
armature drivers and instead of working
like a traditional noise cancellation
which would block out or create sound
waves that cancel the waves around you
what they're doing is they're basically
sealing up as well as they can they're a
closed design close back design and
they're trying to block out everything
and then they're actually re adding
selectively
that's really cool I thought but I
thought it Becnel be cool it
I thought you can do like magic change
but okay that's cool that's pretty
impressive I feel like being able to
turn now the real world would be that
would be extremely extremely useful in a
lot of circumstances very cool
technology cuz like and also the fact
that like something like this isn't
really big and ugly is surprising where
like it actually has the ability to like
cut out so much noise around you and
it's taking in all the sound that you it
hears and then just giving it to in
almost real-time basically I could D
tell a difference I know
so essentially real-time no that's very
cool so what they ultimately didn't like
about the video was the way that we
positioned the here.one as a really cool
piece of tech and it really is it works
way better than you'd probably expect
but one that wasn't ready to go
toe-to-toe with Apple's air pods and I
can see why because clearly they were so
strapped for cash that they weren't
going to survive if this one wasn't a
huge commercial success but it looks
like we were right so there you go the
noble chairs icon series real leather
edition includes believe it or not real
leather it's available in three
different color variants with different
stitching patterns and it's designed in
Germany with inspiration from luxury
sports car interiors it's got fully
adjustable height and recline and a
sophisticated locking mechanism and it's
available in either real or polyurethane
leather buy it now on Newegg or learn
more at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching this
video guys if you disliked it you can
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff that
we featured at the link in the hahaha no
you can't do that what is linked in the
video description though is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join and right now I'm
going to adjust my angle to Dennis's
camera angle so that I appear to be
sitting straight
tennis one job man one job pulled the
camera no no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
