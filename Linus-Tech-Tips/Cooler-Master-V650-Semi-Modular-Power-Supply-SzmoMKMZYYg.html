celebrating geek pride by giving away
ten amazing tech prizes for more info
visit the modus Facebook page or modus
com so many of you commented on my
recent video on the Corsair 230 T case
that you'd like to see more videos where
instead of focusing on the latest and
greatest most amazing thing ever we take
some time to point out a value oriented
product that's a good buy and not too
expensive I've decided to turn these
videos into a series called
stuff that doesn't suck at $100 for a
650 watt the V 650 semi modular from
cooler master is right in line with
other 80 plus gold modular power
supplies from a pricing standpoint but
it offers a couple of other things that
not all the others do physically there's
nothing not extraordinary about it
inside the box you find a Quick Start
Guide some environmentally friendly
packaging a power cord 5 installation
screws which is a nice touch in case you
lose one the power supply itself and the
small bundle of surprisingly supple
black modular ribbon cables you get 2
quad SATA harnesses and to triple molex
ones with one of the latter also
including a floppy connector moving on
to the unit itself we find a tastefully
styled matte black gray and gold color
scheme with all of the pertinent
information on a large label on the top
here you'll see that this power supply
features a single 12 volt rail capable
of delivering just shy of its entire 650
watt capacity so you won't need to worry
about which connectors you plug into
what this is fine for a relatively low
capacity unit and this is also where
you'll find the pertinent safety
certifications by the way on the
opposite side cooling is handled by a
120 millimeter fan and this is where we
see the first differentiating feature
compared to C Sonics G Series which is
similarly priced and 160 millimeters
long the VSM unit here is only a hundred
and 40 millimeters long if you're
installing it into a full tower case or
something it doesn't matter but if you
wanted to do a compact build this power
supply should be on your shortlist so to
speak ha anyway which leads us over to
the cabling side the pre-attached cables
use pray
unexceptional sleeving which isn't great
but it's also not a big deal at this
price point and looking at the
pre-attached connectors we've got our 24
pin motherboard connector which seems a
little bit long our a pin CPU connector
which seems a touch short but should be
fine for most mid towers even writing up
the back and then a single PCI Express
cable that has 2 6 + 2 connectors on it
that means that unless we want to use
janky adapters were limited to a single
high performance graphics card I do see
this as a bit of a non-issue though
since a dual graphics configuration on a
650 watt power supply would have to be
with mid-range cards and I generally
recommend a single high-end card versus
two mid-range cards anyway not to
mention that the 750 watt version is
available for another ten dollars with
four PCI Express connectors if you want
that so take that for what it is
finishing up we've got four more plug
spots here for the modular cables that I
mentioned before they're keyed so they
only go in one way and are an ample
length for easy installation again into
pretty much any mid Tower I'd like to
see the SATA connectors perhaps a little
bit closer together on the harness but
this is something that I've been saying
for a long time and no power supply
maker has yet been to my will in this
way so we'll see if Coolermaster decides
to I don't know maybe it'll be like an
optional cable kit or something like
that in the future on the back is the
usual honeycomb grille a power switch
and a standard power input and then
we're led into the stuff that I guess
you can't really see on the surface
color master is really proud of this
unit for a couple of reasons first up is
that they're using all Japanese
capacitors inside the quality of which
compared to other options on the market
is fairly well-established and next up
is something that they're calling the
gold guarantee a five-year warranty is
good a five-year warranty with costs
completely covered is outstanding now I
know in many industries it's standard
for a company to cover shipping both
ways for a return but in the computer
industry the standard procedure is to
have the customer cover shipping the
item back to the depot and the
manufacturer cover shipping it back to
the customer this is because unlike
clothing or pet supplies there really
isn't that much margin in most computer
parts because high-end
monix are legitimately expensive to make
and the VSM series is no exception so
Coolermaster it's not that they have
like a ton of margin on the thing and
they're just like yeah whatever we can
afford to ship six of them to people if
it comes to that know what they're doing
is they're basically betting big that
these things are so reliable that
they're hardly going to take any back
and it's nice to see a manufacturer
approaching a product with that kind of
confidence it's stuff like this that
makes me happy to give the coolermaster
VSM series my personal doesn't suck
award kudos for taking a step like this
in the right direction in terms of
customer support now I just hope the
rest of the industry starts to shift
that way too as usual guys the link to
pricing and availability is in the video
description below the like dislike and
share buttons which none of you ever use
no one ever shares my videos it's like
you're embarrassed to think computer
stuff is cool or something is that true
anyway the simple also in the video
description is a support link where you
can buy a t-shirt give us a monthly
contribution if you appreciate our work
or change your Amazon bookmarks so we
get an affiliate kickback whenever you
buy stuff that helps us out a lot thanks
again for watching it as always don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for more this stuff oh and hold on and
tell us what you think of our stuff that
doesn't suck segment because I'm you
know I always need your guy's feedback
to know if we're doing the right stuff
