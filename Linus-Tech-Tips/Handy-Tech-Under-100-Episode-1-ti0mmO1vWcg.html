before this is actually going to be kind
of a three-way unboxing of just some
recent stuff that Linus Media Group
employees have bought that we think is
useful and we wanted to show you guys so
first up is the an tech advanced
uniquely named a four port USB charging
station what this is is it is from a
reputable brand so you can actually
trust it and it is essentially a USB
power hub that is able to charge your
devices not only faster but also more
efficiently than other solutions so
inside the box you find an AC power cord
and the USB charging hub itself so it's
got a 2.1 rather a 2 amp port another to
import and 2-1 amp ports all you do is
plug it into the wall and it can provide
a total of up to 5 amps so you'll notice
this is a little bit less than the 6
amps of total power that it can
theoretically deliver on the ports but
that's fine it just means that things
will go a little bit slower if you
occupy all of them in your charging
devices all at the same time the reason
for going with someone like an Tek for
this is because all these safety
certifications overcurrent protection
over voltage protection all that kind of
stuff that it says it has it'll actually
have there are lots of others sort of
cheap asian knockoffs of products like
this but many of them either I don't
necessarily trust them I don't
necessarily think they're safe or they
are not actually rated to output a
decent amount of amperage on each of the
ports so you could plug a bunch of
things into it but they'd be limited to
anywhere from you know 2 amps to 3 amps
total in spite of having a ton of USB
port so this highly recommended one
lives on my nightstand now and has
replaced a power squid with a whole
bunch of separate AC to USB wall boards
plugged into it's definitely a lot less
bulky alright let's move that out of the
way the next product this is actually
something that I bought this one was for
me I picked it up from Sennheiser it is
their little desk clamping headphone
stand if you're any one thing like me
then you've got headphones that either
live around your neck or on your head
or on your desk or on the floor those
are those are the places that they end
up so this guy right here just has a
little adjustable piece so you can pop
it out like this if I can figure out how
to do it there's a little clamp here
okay so you
pop it out you put it into any one of
the three positions so that it can
either clamp on to a small desk a medium
desk or a large desk it just has a
little spinning thing right here that
you can lock into place then when you're
done with your headphones you can hang
them on there and the advantage of
having a real headphone stand versus
some people also use banana hooks that's
a pretty common sort of like to DIY mod
for a headphone stand the advantage of
having one like this is that because
it's going to match the curvature on the
top of your headphones and it has a
little groove for it they're not going
to fall off and the foam and padding is
not going to be damaged or indented in
any way over the long term as you can
see this is a steel series headset I
have on it right now so it's not limited
in any way to just Sennheiser headphones
it's just one of the nicer ones out
there it's nice and padded and stuff our
third one this one was actually ordered
by Ed zl-- and he's got a very unique
need for this particular product but
there's lots of other uses for it so
this is the into circuit power bank P
Castle 26,000 and it's if anything was
over 9,000 this is it so the first thing
you find inside the box is the P Castle
26,000 on the top you see a voltage
indicator 19 volt 16 volts or 12 volt
output you've also got an LED indicator
for the battery life so you can see
right around 80% on the three sides
there's nothing other than screws and on
the bottom you've got some little feet
to hold it in place so what the devil is
this thing it is a twenty six thousand
milliamp hour essentially battery bank
so on the back you find a 2.1 amp USB
output a voltage selector switch that
goes from 12 to 16 to 19 these are
clearly labeled on the bottom of the
unit and then you have DC out and DC in
for charging it also comes with a
variety of tips all while I'm unpacking
the accessories here I'll walk you guys
through why Ed's will needs one and that
is so Ed's Allah is diesel just for
those of you who aren't familiar with
the real names that were using for
people now so he has a Blackmagic Cinema
Camera and wanted to have something that
could be kind of strapped to the camera
or clipped to a tripod that would
provide much longer battery life at a
very reasonable cost with under $100 in
fact all of the items we have here are
under $100 I think this one's like 30
bucks 40 bucks or something like that in
the headphone holder is about
twenty dollars so he wanted something to
give a much better battery life for that
but it actually can work for a lot of
different things as well so you'll see
it comes with a wide variety of notebook
tips so you can actually use this to
extend your notebook battery life just
for scale I'm going to hold it up next
to what I'd consider to be a fairly
typical gaming notebook this is a GX GX
660 from MSI so it's it's bulky but if
you had this in your bag in addition to
your gaming notebook it's not the end of
the world and to put it in perspective
this is 26,000 milliamp hours this
notebook has a 7800 milliamp hour
battery so you'd be looking at about 4
to 5 X in the effective battery that
you'd get out of your notebook using one
of these tips there's also an AC to DC
plug so you go ahead and plug this in
this is how you actually charge the unit
so that is an 18 point 5 volt 2 amp
adapter in order to charge that baby up
you've also got a USB 2 DC adapter
you've got some other random adapters so
the idea is that it comes with there we
go so we've got like looks like iPhone
as well as micro USB so there are some
adapter tips for this guy right here so
that you can have whatever you're going
to need in order to charge things off of
the unit and finally it comes with a
little carrying case and a warranty card
so very very versatile I think a couple
other people here are planning to get
one so that was why I figured I'd show
this to you guys thank you for checking
out our little I guess we'll call this
segment stuff that cost less than $100
and makes your geeky life better like
the video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it you can check out the
links in the video description if you
have any sort of you're interested in
getting any of this stuff and leave a
comment letting us know what you think
