quick unboxing of the OCC agility SSD
drive so the agility is basically a
series of drives that falls in between
the vertex and the solid - so the
agility is based on the same in the Lynx
controller as the vertex and the solid -
as well as the vertex turbo as well as
the vertex CX in fact most of OCC's
current SSD drives are based on the into
Lynx barefoot controller but there is a
key difference the agility drives which
are more of a value option compared to
the premium vertex drives do not have
the same speed of flash okay so the
agility is actually only capable of
reads up to 185 megabytes per second
here you can have a look at this and
sustained writes of up to 60 megabytes
per second so that's quite a bit slower
than the vertex is capable of but what
it actually means in terms of real-world
performance is very little because most
of the benefit of an SSD drive actually
comes from the random reads and writes
which are still very impressive on the
agility versus the sustained reads and
writes so inside the box we will find
the jali the nice little package here
and we also have a little installation
guide and warranty info booklet which
includes an installation guide as well
as warranty info Thank You ocz now the
agility actually I have the 30 gig here
today but it's available on a bunch of
different capacities 30 60 120 and 250
as of the time of this video the 250 is
actually brand new and was just released
we just got stock of that one quite
recently so outside that's a pretty
exciting thing because valley 250 gig
drives haven't really been available
widely ok so you can see from the top of
the drive it looks almost identical to a
vertex it's quite similar so it's got a
black covering on the top it's silver on
the bottom but the one big difference is
that this is a different sticker ok so
on the vertex it's black and white
whereas on the agility is green you'll
find your typical seated power as well
as SATA to data interface at the back
and I guess that pretty much covers it
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the OCZ agility SSD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
