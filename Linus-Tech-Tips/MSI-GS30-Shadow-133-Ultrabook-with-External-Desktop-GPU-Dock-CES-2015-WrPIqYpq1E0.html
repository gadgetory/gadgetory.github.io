brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX we're here in the msi suite
with what for me personally is the most
exciting thing I've seen at the show yet
which isn't really saying much this is
only the second suite we've been to but
this is something that I'm pretty stoked
on anyway this is the GS 30
shadow-zero-zero 1 it's a gaming
notebook that has a very thin and light
design so they're using what appears to
be the same material as as their GS
series so like a Malecha blasted
finished magnesium kind of shell it's
got an extremely thin display 2 USB 3
ports Intel Gigabit LAN HDMI out an SD
card reader audio ports an intel core i7
4870 HQ quad core processor and iris pro
graphics yeah that's right gaming laptop
$2,000 iris pro graphics no no hold on
it gets it gets better than that so
what's going on over here is we're
running external and external display
not off of the notebook itself but off
of this included box underneath it so
I'm actually going to go ahead and shut
it down because right now the way it
works is in order to switch between
standalone notebook mode and notebook
with like beastly graphics mode you do
have to shut down the machine because
here at the back we can go ahead and is
it shut down unlock it it's like
mechanism it
it's like Lock and Load your notebook
right here at the back is a PCI Express
16 X Gen 3 interface so that is a full
speed link any high end GPU you could
possibly want to want you can run off of
that and you don't just you know just
stick it in the slot at the at the back
of the notebook no no that's that's not
how it works it's much more elegant than
that this box down here contains a
speaker just in case you don't have
speakers for whatever reason or
something like that it's got some more
i/o for the notebook so 4 more USB ports
killer LAN 2 more audio ports a power
button as well as a cooling fan and then
inside this is awesome I'm just gonna
open it up here try not to break it this
time whoops
ok yeah and then inside we've got a PCI
Express 60
a lot a 450 watt power supply and then
we can see now that that cooling fan is
gonna allow us to run well msi says any
of their graphics cards and any
reference card up to a GTX Titan black
or r9 290x pretty much anything you
could want to put in it compared to
Alienware solution this is still
proprietary so it's not the you know
most elegant thing in the world we're a
little ways away from just plugging in a
Thunderbolt cable and hot swapping
graphics cards but compared to Alienware
solution it has four times the bandwidth
because the Alienware one runs at PCIe
4x so this and and while that's not
normally gonna be a bottleneck anyway
it's something that gives you in my mind
a little bit more room for the future
because CPUs don't affect gaming
performance the same way that GPUs do
and this could last you through several
GPU upgrades and who knows what the
bandwidth requirements will look like a
couple years from now so this is what's
got my attention because for me carrying
around a bulky gaming notebook like this
18 inch monstrosity over here that we're
also gonna have a video of by the way I
can't even lift and it's so heavy
carrying around something like that is
not necessarily an option but being able
to carry something like this around with
me most of the time and then grab my
dock that actually maybe it does way
more than that notebook but not by much
being able to just grab an extra dock
when I really need the gaming horsepower
is an unbelievable use case scenario
that I think is fantastic so guys thank
you for checking out our video of the GS
30 shadow - 0:01 don't miss any of our
CES coverage our trip to the show here
is brought to you by oh yeah these guys
see them right on the left are on the
microphone phantom glass visit store da
Phantom dot glass right now in order to
get the best dang screen protector in
our mind it's Gorilla Glass so it's as
clear and as satisfying to touch as the
glass that's already on your phone if
you have a high-end smartphone and it
has a nano coating on the back so it
goes on completely bubble free also
