strike if we make a video saying the
wind show is live
what do you mean I don't know what was
going on with that I mean it can't be
any worse than my hair
anyone who skips through the time stamps
it's just gonna be like what is that
that was one of the big takeaways
actually from the whole controversy
around tampon gate you know about tampon
gate right yeah with the Amazon go store
where I was holding up a pad and I'm
like I stole tampons from the store that
was that was so disruptive that on my
Twitter stream we had I had to like
address what was going on and I watched
your video but couldn't have the audio
on because the levels were weird so it
was like blowing people's ears out so I
was like I'm pretty sure he's just
saying all this stuff and then I watched
it the next day and I was right I was
like yeah and I'd never even seen the
video this is like pretty sure this is
about what's going on so one of the
things that came out of that was that I
am a tech bro okay so I had never heard
before I had never heard the term tech
remember that either but yeah kind of
tech bros are there they're there like
dubrow's you know like bro bro yeah bro
there are those but they're tech and and
they exclude everyone because they're
like Tech Bros think we exclude everyone
actually it has more to do with us just
not really knowing how to talk to anyone
yes if you want the stereotypical tech
tech person if social awkwardness is
exclusion then like yeah yes the most
exclusionary group we love each other
though so we just don't know how to tell
each other
Luke and I know how to tell each other
we're special like that yeah special
bond but then I I have I have grown to
accept that I have bad hair okay so I
I'm okay with it I'm just gonna you know
what they're I'm not making it worse I'm
not making it better
it's just bad what they mostly feel
though I just go like that a whole bunch
and then apparently it's fine so okay
yeah sure whatever
get rekt don't you try it gotta love it
so what do I do
just like sweep it to one side like
finger rake to one oh it's gelled
yeah well that's not work we're gonna
hope for the best today
how's that Oh seriously there's one
little bit up in the back but the rest
of it it looks less gel then it looks
like it's just kind of sweeping over
yeah the back screwed up
cuz the gels whole so I'm using like
hand oils that bit about our
exclusionary maybe this is why brought
to you by people who don't look very
credible yeah so in video leaks and
pictures motorola under fire for copying
and copying the iPhone 10 day oh I'm
just doing this okay Thunder Phoenix
issued with tech quickie and the core I
999 hundred K confirmed to be soldered
rumor I can't get the chat on twitch
intro just like
I'd why didn't you have
mid xn7 24 just subscribe which bride
Linux fans 7:24 subscribe to the wrong
channel
I think you were thinking of - not going
to
our sponsors all right so we've got a
great show for you guys today I think we
already ran through some of the topic
wonderful but Joe actually we first
we're gonna go for it we're gonna talk
about other stuff
oh I was actually just gonna go totally
totally off oh hey off script and I
don't know I don't know how to spell it
which is really unfortunate why can't I
find this no that's definitely not it
let me help no one has any idea what
we're looking for no one has any idea
what we're looking for we'll find it
there we go
so guess who we have here in the studio
today dude I found it first three right
you know what well I hate you so we have
conflicts and he doesn't actually know
that I was planning to have him come say
hi on the LAN show but basically he does
like robot stuff and like stem sedov and
this video right here is an unboxing and
let's play with the super Anthony
ultimate battle humanoid robot with 45
kilograms servo punch and come on over
here let's talk about let's talk about
what we shot today so this is his video
which you're not gonna copyright strike
me over this no no no no please no
copyright strike
no copyright okay no copyrights right
good you heard it from you heard it from
him say say hi everyone
hey guys I don't know I don't know how
many people are like spazzing out right
now conflicts but flies says who what
else we got some and Ritu says
cornflakes cornflakes I think they're
just messing with you guys
because good old good old twitchchat
they are all about being well twitch
chat yeah um so basically what we were
doing today here I'm just gonna throw
your thing up here actually yeah do you
want to run them through what we did
today this is pretty cool
get a little closer to drink so let me
actually change all right no problem
that's why that
really hadn't so we went ahead and made
a video showcasing super Anthony now
super Nathan is a robot that's actually
been out for some time but they're
finally launching it on Kickstarter
where that you can actually go ahead and
buy it
it's a fighting robot now the unique
thing about this robot is it's really
really strong it's got a 45 kilogram
punch force and both lioness and I
actually fought against each other and
did a few different things so definitely
do stay tuned for that video once it
comes out yeah we've completed some
challenges if you want to learn more
about the robot in the meantime you can
check out conflicts this video here it's
a present Leo Joe oh yeah definitely
oh yeah no definitely and it's
controlled with like a knock off
PlayStation controller so it's actually
very intuitive
there it is punching are you gonna show
us the uppercut or is that the uppercut
punch job how many servos does this
thing have like twelve fourteen
something like sixteen or eighteen
sixteen or eighteen yes so it can do
some pretty crazy stuff it can pick
itself up off the floor both from the
front and the back I think he's probably
gonna demo that in a second here and
without spoiling too much I will say
that the video we shot together today
involves breaking eggs and definitely
also involves a custom-built battle
robot arena that ed and James spent the
better part of the last two days
building yeah so I mean really the
reason that this collab came about was
that what are they called again
limitless limitless IQ limitless IQ so
limitless IQ the makers of the super
Anthony actually sent robots to both
conflicts and me and then when both of
us followed up and said hey you know
what would be great if we could get a
couple of super Anthony's and battle
them their response was sorry we only
have a limited number of samples you can
only have one - which I believe we both
replied look I don't need you to send
another one for me to keep or whatever
we just really think it would enhance
the video a lot if we could fight them
can you
just lend me one to which they responded
no we can't do that we only have a
limited number of samples now we went
one step further actually before we
reached out to Conn here this is this is
great before we reached out to him we
kind of said well we don't really think
there's a video in here if we don't have
two of them to fight so do you want it
back then and they went no and we went
okay
so on the one hand your story is you
don't have enough samples to send out
enough of them but the flip side of it
is you don't want it back so we were
like okay well we want to make a video
about this because this is cool
so we're just gonna find someone else
who has it fly them out with the robot
which was a breeze to get through TSA
right no it was not I had three TSA
agents literally investigate me and to
the full extent like they almost like
thought I was gonna like even like
hijack the plane or something with your
18-inch robot I guess now in the future
I mean it was six foot that's a
different situation
narrator but you know that's crazy
yeah so yeah we had a lot of we had a
lot of fun today though I think we the
final video is not going to be
particularly informative but it'll
definitely be fun if you want the
informative spin on super Anthony go
check out complexes Channel all right oh
yeah we had we had a lot of fun today
yeah we have no other way to get past
that I saw the arena and I saw Maggie
James messing around with the robot yeah
just by itself yet he had it like roll
over which was insane
yeah yeah and he showed it like
crouching and jumping and punching it
actually has a special move where it can
do like a head level sidekick geez yeah
but you have to have be really nimble
you have to have the friction on the
floor just right when you think we're
back to like you know some of the viral
robot videos out there when there's that
like soccer game and they just keep
falling over no I don't I'm Robot
soccers probably all you need to
actually look up each twk robot SPL
finals that sound familiar at all that
does so does the one below that one on
the
search be human versus htw just like
jump into it yeah here hold on a second
guys I'm gonna just screen share here
real quick you haven't seen this I have
not seen this there's a few of these
okay but like just you can just jump
into it and they like they like try to
dive to stop the ball but it's like okay
like you see what I mean like when this
is what most people have seen being able
to see the super Anthony like jump
around and kick and punch and dodge and
roll and all this kind of stuff was like
pretty impressive one thing I think
about this is I'm not sure that they're
actually controlled no I don't think so
yeah I think they're like sensors and
stuff so that's a totally different
field but I know is he gonna get it come
on kick head the goal is just like
completely checked out but yeah when
like when like I think most of what
people have seen in terms of robots it's
like this the the robot falling off the
stage in Japan and like all this other
kind of stuff yeah yeah 2016 it's like
it's fall over all the time and like
this is not the experience that you have
with the super Anthony you know at least
not that I saw yeah no he fault he falls
over a fair bit especially because his
traction on the floor is not super right
amazing yeah he just sounds like metal
paddles and remember - we're fighting so
part of the goal of fighting is making
something fun yeah a lot of the fighting
ended up being less like like Rock'em
Sock'em robots like clear punch clear
contact and you know he falls away well
okay but then it ended up being a lot of
like punching kind of getting hooked on
the other robot on the withdrawal and
then pulling him over and ripping and
then and then like rolling on the floor
like ground fighting lots of fighting
going on the floor
maybe they're trying to make it more
realistic and you know okay I you know
how someone in twitch chat tried to say
cornflakes or whatever yes I thought he
might have been legitimately trying to
do a play on words with conflicts like
conflict so we asked him that today and
then oh he was like oh yeah sure I like
it had never occurred to him when I
first heard the channel name I thought
it was conflicts because there's robot
fighting it start out with robot
fighting okay he actually started out
with with these like effects videos
where he was like minions in real life
that got like 20 million views or
something stupid like that and then
DreamWorks or whoever owns the minions
copyright struck him George oh yeah took
it down and so now he's doing mostly
like robots and stem stuff and tech
stuff yeah cool all right should we
should we do a tech news topic no I
guess should we respond to Thunderfoot
sure okay or we can do a tech news I do
shall we do the Nvidia thing give people
what they want real quick
sure sure so Nvidia leaks Wow so
surprised after SIGGRAPH we all kind of
knew this was coming we not have leaked
specs about what this is a ridiculous
sentence but our TX 280 is more or less
confirmed I don't know if it's actually
been confirmed but there was like very
very obvious hints in the Nvidia video
if you kind of picked through the chat
conversations that were happening on
screen it was super obvious they're
calling it RT X and it's 20 series not
11 series so cuz sure there we go
why not I guess the GeForce r-tx 2080 Ti
that's gonna take a little bit - guys
you're gonna mess with me yeah for a
very long time RTX isn't why would they
why would they have letters that could
have BRE v8 from Radeon technologies
oh geez I didn't think about that but
I'm astonished that they didn't while
you're sitting around thinking of a name
like you'd have to break it down what is
it supposed to bring great racing
oh come oh okay sort of good we should
do a tech working on that by the way
yeah probably yeah yeah but like G has
been invidious thing for a very long
time
r has been a TI slash AMD's thing for a
very long time so what's happening -
g-force then I don't know so the reserve
a horse so the rumor ray Romano's Lau is
that there will be RT x and gtx cards
but i don't know that that has been
confirmed at all and within videos big
push towards ray tracing i don't really
foresee that being a thing yeah so it'll
have 11 gigs of ram GD dr 6 memory that
is on a 352 bit bus that doesn't sound
right but i thought it would be 348 okay
I mean I'm the GDD r6 memory is
apparently gonna be clocked at 14
gigabit per second okay and also there
will be an RT X let me have a look
2080 and that'll have 2944 CUDA cores
not 3072 as previously speculated and
they'll have eight gigs on a 256 bit bus
now what would really 11 really
interesting about this would be that if
Nvidia launches their TI card with the
50 percent wider memory bus and their
non TI card at the same time this will
be the first time in a while that we've
seen them actually launch a big core do
you think it's gonna happen right when
they bring out a new architecture I mean
if there are rumors circulating at this
point when we are a week from when they
are less than a week from when they're
rumored to be launching it yeah if there
are rumors circulating the their smoke
there's fire at this point I've yet to
see a
Oh card that's rumored to be launching
next week with names and specs and many
different sources being reported by
different news organizations and
everyone pretty much being on the same
page about it I've yet to see that not
turn into a real product launch so there
you go if you're waiting for a graphics
card then quick go sell yours now so the
people who aren't paying attention to
the tech news will see it and buy it
yeah and then and then you can get your
new graphics card that presumably will
be faster but then maybe only in rate
racing applications wouldn't that be
horrible well they're probably gonna do
the same kind of thing in terms of
honestly I didn't watch the SIGGRAPH
stuff whoops but they might have already
but they are probably gonna do the same
kind of thing they did with the last
launch with Pascal weather like it's
three times faster in this specific
application vr related applications yeah
so what I what I kind of am picking up
here is if you look at the 1080 TI and
you look at the 1080 I think there's
what about a thirty percent performance
Delta give or take twenty to forty
somewhere in that range and what they
had done the last couple generations was
they had launched the step-down GPU at a
performance level that was competitive
or a little bit better than last gen so
980 for example was a little bit faster
than 780ti 1080 was a little bit faster
than 980ti
even though this was the step-down chip
competing with the big chip from the
last gen yeah if they're launching both
twenty eighty and twenty atti does that
tell us that twenty eighty wasn't fast
enough to be an upgrade for 1080 TI
owners and they couldn't wait another
six to eight months which has been the
typical gap possibly very true I would
honestly line up a little bit more with
like I know they do marketing stuff all
the time and people want to sell cards
so they never really want you to think
something's coming until like super
close to before it's coming yeah I mean
why didn't you just say there's no new
cards oh you think that no no there's no
way they're just Pascal with Rachel
into the net why not it would not be the
first time yeah it would be the first
time for that it would not be the first
time that they essentially rebadged this
would be like a rebadge with an upgrade
that's even better there's no way that's
all they've been working on for the last
two years no but I might need it might
be all they need to release see the
problem can be wrong and okay the
problem here is that I I haven't seen
any benchmarks for the Turing based the
Turing based I think are the quadros or
Tesla's the Quadros so I haven't seen
anything for the new cards they just
launched it's SIGGRAPH so I have no way
of knowing how how similar those are to
the Pascal ones there's no way that's
right it's probably maybe someone in
twitch chat is it's fun being helpful
here there's ones people then a second
they said Turing is Volta iterated and
ray-tracing is enabled by tensor cores
so Volta versus Pascal I actually don't
know clock for clock CUDA for for cuda
core for kuduk or how much that improved
holy crap you don't think the new ones
are just basically the old ones it's
been a while since we've had that you
know with ray-tracing bolted to them it
might it might be time oh boy that would
actually be very disappointing
okay well on that you have much faster
memory the memory is real fast yeah okay
so good job miners isn't mining like
kind of dead right now I mean it's it's
lower than it has been in the past but I
know people that are still profitable
really it's just you have to be in the
right location because if right all
right
and you're only profitable if you catch
out if you cash out that's the right
time yeah and that's okay that's one of
the ways that people have made a lot of
money is there actually might and who
knows do not do this because I'm saying
yeah we're not recommending it to be
very clear very clear about that
yeah there have been people not you
unless it is you I don't know what you
there has been people that's mind we're
in it's very not profitable right and
gathered a bunch of coins and not sold
and then it's gone up and then they've
sold so it cuz like mining while it's
profitable is only actually better if
you're selling like every day right
right because it only actually matters
when you sell sure except it's been down
for like a while now except it often
goes down at the beginning of the year
and then doesn't do very well in the
middle of the year and then comes up
near the rest of the like the latter
half of the year so hmm the heck knows
man alright then I kind of hate mining
but whatever I'm speaking of things that
that we hate I don't hate motorola
but this was posted by roar and roars NZ
on the forum and this is pretty brutal
so hit me with your best shot
Luke Mining tips know which one of these
is an iPhone 10 and which one of them is
Motorola's new phone no no you don't get
to look anymore no what what which one
was which what which one was which I
have no idea okay hold on hold on hold
on get ready get ready I didn't see it
that much okay you can see it again go
ahead and it's gone
which one's an iPhone 10 yeah I can't I
can't say with like an educated guess I
don't know they're so similar
I'm gonna read which one well okay the
right one is the iPhone 10 yeah yeah
yeah okay because you can cheat now I
was trying to ignore this yeah that's
pretty clear so I was just being like
okay well they could have swapped that
onto the thing but outside of this which
is like hello I'm Android yeah and
especially the icons below it outside of
that I can't tell at all isn't that
brutal did they cheat is it literally
the same frame oh look at the back wow
yeah I know right
like what are you doing there bud
like is this the same panel from Samsung
that's what I want to know because the
curvature B looks identical I haven't
seen them they advertise it with that
color splash on it right
did they cuz this is where at the top
one of my biggest points of confusion
was like did they just swap over the
clock just to trick people that's why I
was like what I don't know no no this is
a different phone so they even put the
flash between the two rear cameras here
and like so on the one hand I am far
from the world's biggest Apple apologist
but that's it's nude neither am i you're
currently making a video about tricking
trying to fix their stupid iMac yeah but
like that's brutal
that's design your own phone guys and
I'm not necessarily on Apple side with
the whole lawsuit going on between them
and Samsung that's been going for about
what seven years now or whatever over
the original Galaxy S and all the
similarities it boarded the iPhone or
whatever
Samsung has for the most part tried to
do their own thing separate from Apple
colors very long time colors recently -
they've really departed their this is
brutal is very brief this is a brazen
and blatant ripoff brazen indeed I like
that um thank you thank you I worked
hard on that $40 word so I don't know
the argument that's raging right now is
are these are these unique design
elements the knotch
the camera placement the wallpaper or is
this just now standard building blocks
of a phone and we shouldn't care about
this kind of thing who are you laughs on
this one I'm with Apple on this one to
be completely honest that's brutal
there's like there's there's even little
things that they could have done
make it a you know just marginally
different yeah the knotch both sides
having the knotch I don't necessarily
see that being a huge deal personally um
way to go you copied Apple doing
something literally no one asked for
yeah hooray
but like everything it's the it's the
fact that everything is the same like if
they had the knotch but the back was
different if they didn't have the notch
in the back was the same like it at
least like a little bit even then I'd be
like oh they trying to make it so that
everyone else thinks that you haven't
yeah you could make it you could make
it's still not great but the fact that
it's all that way it's just released you
could make an argument that way and like
at least put a notably different
wallpaper what well you can I mean when
they do something like that something
completely blatant like the wallpaper
you didn't tell that they're not they're
clearly not targeting us they're not
targeting the tech I think it's
intentional confusion to a certain
degree yeah yeah yeah I think they're I
think they're targeting I saw ads for
this one that looks like that one with
me I think so I think it's I think it's
I think it's going that way that's not
cool
I don't know if Lenovo which is
Motorola's parent company now they own
the brand I don't know if they have
responded to this but I would be
interested to hear what they have to say
for themselves if they're smart they'll
probably just say nothing and hope the
whole thing blows over but someone in
the circuit it's not helpful because
Apple makes a lot of noise about getting
copied or people ripping off their
design or you know it being frustrating
to be you know the one who's pushing
design forward and what's frustrating
for me is when things like this happen
it adds a lot of weight to apples
whining yeah
whereas if Apple was just constantly
whining which they probably would anyway
if Apple was just constantly whining
about this stuff but they could never
back it up then it would actually be
damaging to themselves
but as it is if companies like Motorola
are running out and actually copying the
iPhone it means that every time Apple
gets to cry about this we have to take
it more seriously
I believe yo I absolutely do but but
maybe it was intentional
maybe Motorola knew this was gonna
happen they wanted it to happen
people want us to show the p20 Pro
that's another now we're actually
talking about a Motorola phone on the
land show that's true we normally would
not have done that
so here's the p20 Pro it's not the same
it's not quite the same I actually would
say it's a notable depart the notch is
way smaller camera setup on the back is
different I know it's similar but
there's another camera the logo is not
in the same spot in the center there's
branding here there's only so much you
can do with a phone these days this is
clearly a different phone yeah as that
Motorola phone was not clearly a
different phone and that's like if I was
if I was super ignorant to phones I
wouldn't necessarily know which one of
those was the iPhone which one wasn't
but I would know that there were
different phones like when you
originally showed me that thing if the
time wasn't there it felt like Android
clock thing yeah isn't there I would
have legitimately thought that they were
actually identical phones and even then
I thought they might have been and
someone just photoshopped it over
someone in the chat was like you're
Keisel straight was dead because we
don't have as many viewers as we
normally do do you want - there's like
reasons why oh we can't promote the
stream on YouTube it yeah we can't we
can't like normally we would do a video
we would upload it to YouTube saying hey
we're live over on Twitch click the link
in the video description yeah but
YouTube gave us a Community Guidelines
strike for doing that before so this is
more like our organic live streaming
bearish absolute which honestly if we
wanted more views on land show we would
just stream it to YouTube
yeah our typical YouTube stream
viewership is over 10,000 concurrence
we've had as high as I think 2030 like
big big numbers compared to what we do
over here but honestly when show at this
point is not really about lots of
viewers know it's actually probably even
better having a
slightly slower chat yep it's not about
lots of viewers it's not about lots of
money we could get a lot more
sponsorship dollars for wine show if we
managed it differently like if we
published it properly as a podcast we
know oh yeah apparently we've been doing
double uploads one of which is usually
corrupted for like some period of time
oh I know yeah anyway
yeah Colton's upload is corrupted well
why does he upload I just told him this
I don't know okay yeah I thought he
stopped okay anyway there are definitely
things we could do to make LAN show
better but for us when show is just
about sort of tradition at this point
more than anything else like Luke has
better things to do now that he's CEO of
floatplane media quite frankly well this
is my like I work more hours than normal
anyways so my weekend essentially starts
like right before when Justin in like in
how I calculate everything this is like
this is I'm time off essentially right
now so yeah we're just we're just kind
of chillin doing our thing yeah telling
you about our sponsors right spectrum oh
I got some blast for you yeah which ones
you want that one alright let's see
you've probably got the lady ones
actually I like these ones staring at a
monitor all day can be hard on your eyes
and make it tougher to fall asleep
spectrum is an affordable long-term
solution to staring at a computer screen
where you still get to stare at the
computer screen using a software
solution like flux and Twilight doesn't
give you the same type of filtering that
these do and spectrums lineup includes
many stylish frames high high quality
products with a one-year warranty low
color distortion so even though you're
filtering blue light you're still not
looking at just the entire world as
though it has a big yellow like sheet of
you know Cinna foil on it and the
highest rated among their competitors on
Amazon so they are primarily focused
around Canadian and US customers but
they are expanding to Europe and they
offer shipping internationally next up
this is interesting well now that you
did
I think you did it better
did I yeah I think so hold on let's try
it let's try again okay you go first
we'll let the audience judge okay hold
on the time okay
well that will let twitch chat just spin
it and tell us who did it better
okay okay ready three two one okay I
think you won I cracked up okay okay
thank you
I'll bite my cheek I'll buy my cheek all
shout is getting timed out automatically
by the bot right now so there's that
okay Kel look that's my weakest one I
want to see what twitch ad says I saw a
lot of me yeah James James apparently
James win good job James thank you
ladies and gentlemen we have a sponsor
that has been gone for a while but is
back now synergy if you're an IT
professional or power user who uses two
or more computers at the same time
they're run a different operating system
on each like Windows Linux or Mac OS you
could have a severe keyboard and mouse
problem you probably have a bunch of
them strewn across your desk and it's
hard to remember which one goes to which
one that's annoying synergy helps you
fix that problem it's a software
download that combines your desktop
computers into one cohesive experience
so you can run a single keyboard and
mouse across multiple computers
seamlessly including being able to just
move the mouse across them and being
able to copy paste files drag and drop
files all that kind of cool stuff so
check out the link below the video
that's seamless concise synergy / at
Linus tech tips to learn more and then
finally we've got moss
it was hard to tell the difference I'm
actually using one of their backpacks
right now I quite like this one
so this is the MAS organizer does yours
have the orange inside I think I rave
about this like every time yes but I
love that and you use it every day so do
you notice it when I'm looking for
something in the bottom of my bag yes
it's just I can't now let's see if the
one that is on the show actually has I'm
sure it does I think they all do oh
really
yeah I think that's kind of a thing
because their logos or injury so it's
got an expansion zipper so you can
increase the capacity or decrease it
yeah personally I don't find that that
useful because I want my maximum
capacity all the time I do the same
stuff but it's slightly wider and
thinner oh it's got a wider and thinner
quick access pocket so is that this one
I don't know what the quick access
pocket is but there you go this opens up
a lot this is some of the thread used to
make the black pack I think they meant
backpack no that's the name of this oh
oh the black pack oh cool yeah so it's
apparently really strong this is a
handwritten note in here some of our
sponsors are hilarious I love that kind
of stuff hello yeah that's super cool
okay whoever wrote that note ten out of
ten okay now don't sandbag this okay
well I want to try first
okay don't sandbag it break it if you
can okay he's been doing him a lot of
working out lately yes you got it no no
no no that came off I need more tips
your hands or small oh I think I can it
did you break it
yeah okay so you managed to break it
yeah can you do it again oh wow it cuts
into you before it breaks I'll tell you
that much yeah yeah I need more okay
okay all right not bad terms of other
features so they've got a sunglass
holder in the top that's been really
handy on mine I have that same thing as
well this one doesn't have quite as many
pockets as mine
frankly I don't end up using them a lot
of the time anyway oh and this one has
their built-in power strip thing
so you cable manage that through there's
a hole somewhere around here
can't remember exactly where it is but
there's a cable management hole and then
it's got a regular outlet and it's got a
couple of USB ports so the idea is you
can actually have all your devices and
stuff like cable managing to your bag so
you can charge the whole thing by just
Oh am i holding it out of frame free by
just plugging in this one plug and then
it just sits there and all your junk
inside charges including your laptop
because it does have a full AC power I'm
sorry for doing that to you that's got a
tablet holder as well as a laptop pouch
and it's got a five-year warranty it's
got a removable chest strap and uh yeah
that's pretty much it basically good
stuff really comfortable um I was using
another bag for a little bit before this
one and I don't remember what this one's
called and I don't think there's a label
anywhere that says what it's called that
I'm sure you know I'm sure you'll find
it on their website so that but see it's
got a few more little like management
things and especially this pocket the
second pocket I think this one's bigger
it's got a few more little things that I
can put stuff in but I end up just kind
of checking everything into the bottom I
believe that's just called the moss pack
so the pack I guess so I did I did I
busted it twice okay by brick the amount
of effort that went into busting one
thread was was quite high try again it
kind of hurts I know but I want to do it
now now that you did it I wouldn't have
felt that if you couldn't do it oh yeah
like it doesn't feel like it's not
comfortable yeah I think I almost cut
myself how like a few times got it there
you go okay okay so there you go moss
challenges but it's a single threat Wow
so like yeah I know it doesn't feel like
I'm good yeah yeah I've got this thing
that's not a hand to wrinkle that only
hurts yeah
why alright so let's talk about under
puts things so Thunder back at it again
with another myth busted the three
million dollar food scanner busted
so basically overall I watched part of
the video and a lot of good points in
here about these guys look how credible
she looks that's awesome um just feels
like an infomercial showing off their
molecular scanner that they claim will
allow you to see the the chemical
breakdown of the food that you point to
that or point their scanner at and use
something something infrared something
something something something something
anyway the reason we're bringing this up
is because footage from tech quickie was
taken out of context in such a way that
it appeared as though we had been
sponsored by one of these molecular
scanner companies and hadn't disclosed
it and now we're not entirely not at
fault here what we didn't do was
validate that these particular molecular
scanners because we did bring up at
least one of them in the video we hadn't
validated that they actually worked
because the video was about the
technology in general which does work
and we mentioned in the video at the end
of the video we mentioned that these
handheld ones were ok so actually midway
through the video we mentioned these
handheld ones are not going to replace
the much more expensive versions of this
technology that are for lab use we do
mention that and we also say at the end
of the video that we can't speak to the
efficacy of these particular devices at
this time but we say you know we're
excited to see where this technology
heads unfortunately the way that it was
presented in this video it made it look
as though we were endorsing the
technology and the product in particular
and that we hadn't disclosed some kind
of sponsorship another note that we have
here I haven't seen our version of this
video to be completely clear but I know
how we make things we could have done a
better job of saying that we hadn't
validated it fair
but apparently we do say the company's
claims we don't say that it absolutely
works this way we say that it they claim
that they work this way so basically I
just wanted to pull I just wanted to
talk to you guys and say hey no we were
not sponsored yes we could have done a
better job of making sure that a product
that we're using as an example of a
technology that we're talking about
actually works and does not come across
as endorsing and and we could do a
better job of making sure it doesn't
come across as endorsed but the fact of
the matter is we were not sponsored we
have nothing to do with that company
we've never talked to them we've made no
effort to get our hands on their
molecular scanner and yeah it's probably
BS based on what I've seen so far the
other thing that I also don't know I
actually I have not looked into this the
other thing that I don't know is how the
timing lines up so I don't know if these
were actually available to try yet oh
okay at the time that we made the video
so in did we make yeah we're just gonna
be a lot more cautious about any pieces
we do on emerging technology but the
thing that frustrated me was just that
the way it was presented made us look
like complete idiots well I think I'm
kind of his goal right yeah I guess so
pretty much ever that's his shtick yeah
that's that's cool I guess all right so
next up that's a bit of digging yeah
that video is kind of old now yeah it's
a couple years of nearing a year and a
half always actually we've got other
news so this was posted on the forum by
NumLock 21 and the original article is
from the video cards com so take that
for what it is
let's just be let's just be very clear
I'll actually hold on before we move on
ran machan 97 asks are you going to
copyright trick them for using your
content and properly no they haven't
actually okay well we could make the
argument that taking it out of context
could be improperly but that's something
that we would have to fight in court
that's not something that is as simple
as
because you used our footage it has
therefore been used improperly there
could be a fair use defense there if the
argument is made that one entity is
reporting on something another one has
done that's how you can get around
having a whole lot of footage from a
movie with just voiceover if you are
using it in order to critique the movie
so no honestly normally we wouldn't even
bring up something like this it was just
that some members of our community that
I actually recognized were in the
comments section on that video saying
that they thought we were honest and
they thought we disclosed our sponsors
and I wanted to make sure that you guys
know we do and never leave a contact
with them and we have nothing to do with
those guys
aside from picking a topic that maybe
was a little premature someone brought
up tarnish is your brand image perhaps I
don't think we're gonna we're gonna do
it we're not really in the in the market
of we're not really we're not really a
drama channel I know you don't we don't
really do that you know there's been
there has been far worse things that
people have said about us but given that
they didn't raise the attempt grab the
attention of our community we have just
completely ignored them because what's
the point of drawing attention to it
yeah I mean all we've really done at
this point is give Thunderfoot some more
Adsense revenue and that's really the
only thing that you accomplish typically
through drama so I guess I'm gonna oh
okay I guess I'm gonna go off on a
tangent here I guess I'm gonna kind of
ruin YouTube for a lot of the people
that haven't like clued into this but
the vast majority of the drama you see
is manufactured not all of it but the
vast majority would probably think it is
mutually beneficial for two entities of
some sort or another to be feuding you
know I wonder if that's the game Samsung
and Apple are playing like hold on a
second hold on a second think about this
on a much much hold on
think about this on a much much better
fighting and nothing else matters yes if
Apple wants
their message to be that their brand
identity is unique and being copied even
I bet it costs less to sue Samsung than
it does to market that on TV and if
Samsung wants their message to be that
we we forged our own path but are they
not better off biting Apple in court
where it will be reported on by the same
news outlets they would have to buy
banner space and ad space on may be do
they even care who wins
maybe whoa now look normally I don't go
all conspiracy theory' tinfoil hat but I
do not yes we do
we both do that's like part of this show
well okay not not not okay not
implausibly okay I think this is very
plausible though so then you're not
doing it implausibly
right okay okay okay what entire twitch
check mind blown
collusion all the Illuminati eyes BAM
Linus Jones oh no that's not that's not
what I need no way ah don't say the full
name apparently that can get you like ah
what an interesting anyway so the vast
majority of the drama that you see you
know whether it's between actors or
singers or I mean a great example of
this would be like WWE wrestlers right
that is just so that both people's names
WWE wrestlers don't even remotely try to
hide that though no fair but that's kind
of its own thing
no but the crazy thing is some people
don't see it okay that's fair what like
it is it is very directly communicated
as I know what I'm saying is other
people aren't doing that communication
now BW is being fairly transparent it's
a show
fine whatever I I'm just saying I'm
busting some bubbles out there it's not
my fault that that bubble is entirely
self-inflicted or that's like yeah okay
but I'm still busting bubbles and I'm
still sorry yep twitch chat twitch chats
going nuts wrestling is real yes Olympic
wrestling is real wrassling case I
versus Logan Paul I don't even know who
ksi is Logan Paul versus Jake Paul yeah
that definitely Logan Paul versus X like
a variable yeah one of them is like
really sharply on the decline now I
can't remember which one of the Paul's
yeah one of them is kind of leveled off
and the other one is like in a nosedive
right now oh yeah that's I was talking
to I was talking to conflicts about this
earlier so he was saying that it was an
advantage for me starting up on YouTube
when I did like 11 years ago because the
playing field was far smaller well all
that but hold on so the playing field
was far smaller and I said yes that is
an advantage no explosive growth but
it's also a double-edged sword yes
because the audience was much smaller at
that time so if you can make yourself
heard above the noise above the vast
number of creators that there are on
YouTube you have the potential for far
more growth than I did back then and far
faster but if you can't make yourself
heard above the noise then you're
basically they're both getting like lots
of subscribers every day
this is Jake's his monthly views is
going back up and his monthly subs is
unlike the tiniest incline ever but
technically an incline
Logan's views is on a decline and his
sobs is more or less flat there they're
both not doing nearly as well as they
were in July in July there are both
fricking kings of the world and to put
this in perspective this monthly sub
count is only marginally higher than
ours on - tech tips so like yeah they're
big or whatever but they're not like I I
would consider us mid mid tier yeah
we're not
top-tier youtubers in the in the sense
that like cuz everyone in the world
that's like connected to the internet
probably knows has heard of these guys
name at some point they're on TV either
in the news yeah Casey talked about them
okay I guess almost every news thing on
YouTube talked about them at one point
for me when I divide into tears it's
less how much of a household name you
are because you know you could find you
know X Hollywood actors who have like
semi-retired but still make youtube
videos or whatever just up there so okay
when I divide into tears
my point is that I don't take like the
entire you got to see it as a pyramid
not as like some kind of a linear scale
because if we were to take all the
youtubers in existence yeah we're
probably in the top fraction of a
percent yeah that doesn't in every
category but that's not we're still mid
tier because there's only so much room
at the top and the guys that are at the
top are on a very very different level
in terms of the momentum that their
channels have the number of views each
of their videos get some guys so
definitely I stepped down how is a five
million plus subs channel mid tier
because there's a good reason yeah
there's far more to life than
subscribers yes so here going back to
these numbers social bleeds a great site
I actually spend a fair bit of time
creeping other creators on there it is a
great site so Linus tech tips good job
boys has never done four hundred million
views in a month Linus tech tips has
still done a mere one point I think it's
about 1.5 billion views ever so to put
that in perspective in a single month
Logan Paul did a quarter as many views
as Linus tech tips has ever done in its
10-year history that is a different tier
yeah when you're talking an order of
magnitude difference in viewership and
or like like what do what do we do in a
month they also what didn't they only
join YouTube okay I think they had
channels before them but they
effectively
join YouTube like two years ago or
something so Linus tech tips is top
month ever here let's have a look
mind you our trajectory is looking a
little bit nicer but its top month ever
was 68 million views yeah it is pretty
good it is but that is an order of
magnitude difference and whenever
someone is 10x well they get to sit in a
higher level of the pyramid yeah and to
be clear like I'm not like mad about it
or anything it's just that you know if I
was if I was about a different content
sphere there's like a lot of things that
are yeah it's not it's not about that
it's just about like when we're when
we're comparing something like our our
viewership numbers to theirs and that's
stuff that we'll do but not to you know
see who has the biggest dick or whatever
it's it's more to do with if we observe
some kind of a change in our viewership
yeah when we go okay is Google tweaking
the algorithm what are they optimizing
for we'll go and we'll look at other
channels known quantities and we'll go
okay so the big channel's the tier one
channels we all see a little dip or
we'll find some small channels that we
like to use as a yardstick oh these guys
are getting boosted okay so maybe
YouTube is favoring or will look at
people who upload very prolifically or
will look at people who upload only once
a week and will go oh interesting so
they're favoring x' before frequent
uploaders or we'll look at people who
upload typically longer videos or
shorter ones so we can use these metrics
to have a look at how YouTube is tuning
the algorithm that's one of the things
that we spend a fair bit of time on
because for better or for worse our our
job is only partially to make videos our
job is also to make people watch those
videos on the YouTube platform which
behaves like a bucking bronco on acid
yeah it's pretty I like that descriptive
yeah to be real though and another thing
is in terms of sub count a lot of people
who subscribe to a channel and then just
slowly stop watching it especially when
the content type changes and like the
the content type from back when we're at
NC X with the like zero editing
unboxings yes that are five minutes long
II to what we have now is a drastic
change and there's people that might
prefer the old unboxing
there's people that might prefer now and
there's probably a lot of people that
don't necessarily watch anymore because
all they wanted was unboxings but
they're still subscribed because YouTube
will just slowly hide our channel if you
look at a channel like PewDiePie he has
changed drastically and like a few times
yeah so he has like huge buckets of
users from differ and he's been huge
every time he's changed so he has huge
buckets of users from all these
different segments that are all
subscribed to him all the same time that
doesn't mean they're all watching right
now if you look at the subscriber count
vs. the views it's yeah you know what
this is a great example because it's as
close to apples-to-apples as we can do
both tech quickie and tech linked our
tech channels so they exist within the
tech vertical they are both being
uploaded from the same IP there's some
speculation that your geographical
location does affect the way that your
content gets propagated they are both
hosted at least sometimes by the same
people they are similar lengths they
both have one baked-in sponsor spot so
there's a lot of analogues that we can
find between these two channels but what
you're gonna see is that like what Luke
was saying because tech quickie has a
much older audience
many of the subscribers from which have
sort of died on the vine tech quickie is
gonna do let's have a look here anywhere
from two hundred and seventy five
thousand three hundred and twenty
thousand one hundred ninety thousand
three hundred thousand so why don't we
say anywhere from two hundred thousand
to three hundred and fifty thousand on
over the last couple of weeks there's
some spiky ones but on 200 to 400 let me
say that there we go this one just went
up five hours ago so we're not counting
that now let's go have that won't even
updated properly tech linked which has
not two point two million but only four
hundred and eighty eight thousand
subscribers and let's have a look at our
viewership there 335 from a day ago 383
300 238 286 275 244 238 four hundred and
forty-four thousand 276 another 400
another 400 thousand one so consider
this
back to the hole would someone like
logan paul be in a different tier than
us especially when he's doing you know
400 million views a month so yeah he
might have only had 12 million
subscribers at that time but given that
they were all thresh and you look at
tech linked which has 1/6 as many
subscribers or so as tech quickie but
does similar viewership because its
subscribers are fresh and you consider
how much bigger then his engaged
audience probably was at that time given
that it was a bigger and b much fresher
that means it's probably more than just
like a 10x difference i mean we're
probably talking more like a 20 or 30 X
difference in terms of the engaged
audience you have glitter somewhere on
your face and twitch chat literally will
not stop I actually drive that car so
yeah that there's glitter on my face is
not surprising mice I'm just I've just
one again day sometime I don't blame
them it looks like it actually is like
sick it looks like a sick car I just
found out that I might be being sent
down to San Francisco in the near future
I am so surprised why I don't travel all
the time some sponsored thing okay but
no no the important thing about San
Francisco oh boy is that oh boy that you
should do a video on it is the location
of lightening motorcycle shouldn't buy
one what you should do a video on it you
should contact them seriously or is it
lightning bikes no is it yeah there we
go so I actually have reached out to
them good since we last talked about it
and I have arranged for a test ride nice
yep I want to buy one just like for a
video yeah mm I told them I was
considering buying one are you filming
it ah maybe not I don't know really cool
bike it's electric and stuff it's dad do
you think I should film it I think so I
don't know yeah they're just gonna say
yes yeah they're the land show on yes
like if we told them should we make a
video of me and Luke just eating our
boogers for like six minutes
like seeing who can see who can harvest
your most meager like they probably
can't do it
not that we're saying you guys don't
have you know great taste but the most
discerning viewers but no no no no no
don't stop all that why not I want to
show how to test our theory they're
obviously gonna say yes okay just just
put it just put it in the twitch chat
just put it in the twitch chat here I'm
screens your bike one is like screen
sharing you it's gonna be no no question
go back go back to your results a whole
bunch of people in chat are saying
boogers yes oh oh dude yes is that 80%
right now 77 79 80 we're holding up okay
so what we're gonna find out here cuz
I'm about to post my poll okay is if
people would prefer boogers more bikes
boo curses hold on at 79% okay hold on I
need I need a minute here okay that's
cuz you're a bikes voter there's nothing
wrong with being a bikes voter it's a
good thing keep telling yourself that's
disgusting we would watch that I mean
like isn't like the popping pitbull
niche like huge on YouTube
what no yeah no like insists and pimples
and stuff is like a huge the millions of
you can you post that for me I'm not
logged in you have got to be coded you
send it to me oh I thought so I Drive
you sure oh hold on you know what I
think I'm fine I'm logged in
hold on no I'm not logged in yet wait
yes I'm logged in and you're sharing my
screen yeah yeah I'm trying your screen
don't worry 200 right right right right
right okay well whatever I'm logged in
there we go all right let's see the bike
results boogers held steady at around
80% seven eight we're at 78 you've got a
thousand votes you and right about a
thousand all right let's just let me get
to the results page here
okay okay okay so the audience has
spoken they prefer bikes to boogers yeah
by a pretty significant margin
I am so surprising yeah ninety four
versus seventy eight percent is I would
say a significant margin it's
significant significant the word has a
frickin omission I know but there's been
no you're not definition no nobody put a
why they're doing this right now okay
okay think it's a letter grade
difference probably caused by something
other than mere chance statistically
significant okay so it's significant it
is all right yeah you know what else is
significant the end of the wind show we
have to go home can't happen by mere
chance
actually it's happened by chance a lot
it has so thanks for watching guys we'll
see you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel why
there's a riot you guys doing a game
pump I'm not gonna games come on go to
pax West I don't think I'm working there
so I was invited to gain some by Nvidia
four days a ticket like a plane ride
their plane ride back so there's a
couple days because it's in Germany
that's not exactly close there's no
direct flight so it's like a day of
travel each way plus you know actually
being there and attending the event I'm
at the point now I'm just like not gonna
do that kind of thing anymore because
well they for some insight they they
briefed you on it immediately before the
stream the like Nvidia stream yeah and
they don't tell you as much as they say
in the stream so and your embargo is
after the stream so there's actually no
point in being there you might as well
be back in the studio you should
probably just like be here and ready to
go just like be on the tight cookie set
yeah maybe I might just not even or who
cares
yeah I don't know like I don't know I'm
getting kind of tired of its that but if
it's that tweaked and a few things added
Pascal mmm I'm getting kind of tired of
manufacturers trying to control yeah
cycle yeah I'm like I've talked about
this off stream before but like this
whole thing where there's an
announcement embargo and an unboxing
embargo and a reviews embargo and a
frickin I don't know new color scheme
embargo you know it to me what it smacks
of is wanting wanting like because it's
none of its they're trying to make you
do a whole bunch of pieces of content
yes and that's the problem we don't have
a problem doing content we'll do content
about all kinds of things we we left our
thread Grif for WX up to a chiller like
there's a commercial chiller you can
just buy is for an aquarium it goes down
to yeah four degrees yeah and it's like
nicely self-contained I showed to you
after it's not even that expensive when
you consider what a custom water cooling
loop can cost anyway so you know we
hooked our thread Ripper WX up to that
you know overclocked it as high as we
could like yeah that's fine
but the difference is that a lot of the
kind of coverage that you are expected
to be doing in this announced
unboxings - the only information they
give you is basically marketing bullet
points so what they're effectively
asking for is free advertising and I'm
at the point now where I don't do
advertising for free and you can kind of
you can read into that whatever you want
you know maybe it comes across maybe I
come across like a prick I don't know I
don't think so but at the end of the day
if you expect me to advertise your
product then I expect you to pay me so
that I can pay my bills and pay my staff
and disclose it to the audience and
disclose it to the audience that's how
advertising works and that's why I think
you don't come across like a brick
because that kind of stuff should be
disclosed if you want advertising then
fine but you have to pay for it it isn't
free and it should wire transactions and
