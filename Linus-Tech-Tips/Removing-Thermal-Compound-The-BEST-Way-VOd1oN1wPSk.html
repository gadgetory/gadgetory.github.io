what's the best thermal compound what's
the best way to apply it to get a
thousand different answers cuz there's
everything from garbage like this all
the way up to high-end compounds full of
silver and diamonds and all kinds of
that crap but what everybody seems to
pretty much agree on is how to remove it
grab some 99% isopropyl alcohol got like
tricks is you slap that on your cpu at
BAM thermal compounds gone but we
thought to ourselves you know what
conventional wisdoms not good enough for
us so we got you guys 15 different
solvents to find out which one truly
removes thermal compound better than
anything else
the Ripjaws km 570 mechanical keyboard
from g.skill features full RGB a simple
design Cherry MX switches and more check
it out now at the link below okay so
you're probably thinking to yourself
come online it's the reason we don't
debate this is we already know the best
way to remove thermal compound but
picture this okay it's late at night you
got the big batch tomorrow
you're building up your rig you're ready
to go except oh no there's no solvent it
turns out earlier in the day little
Johnny took all the rubbing alcohol
poured it all over his skinned knee and
now you've got nothing left
so you're rummaging around in the
kitchen the pantry the bathroom and you
come together with a list of stuff that
looks a little something like this
we've got 100% orange juice we've got
beer we've got distilled water googan
vinegar more beer Windex hydrogen
peroxide absolute vodka vodka fun
whatever you know what it is we've got
nail polish remover alcohol-based hand
sanitizer coke isopropyl at 70 and 99%
concentrations and finally arctic
Silver's fancy expensive Arctic cleans
surface preparation and we're going to
be testing each of them on the two major
types of thermal compounds the more
runny kind and the more kind of
particulate kind okay so we're going to
start with icy diamond and the
methodology is pretty simple we take the
thermal compound with the water and with
a clean CPU and heatsink we apply the
usual grain of rice sighs Boop there you
go and slap our Nhu 12s cooler on top of
it once it's screwed in all the way we
give it the old wiggle to make sure it's
fully spread out and leave it for a
minute or two then we take off the
cooler you can see how this is going to
get pretty old pretty fast and there we
have it a dirty CPU now the original
plan was to take our solvents and kind
of
yeah dump them on to the CPU and then we
realize oh yeah it's probably gonna make
a bit of a mess hold on so as a
compromise we settled on using the
heatsink as our test surface with the
thermal compound smear covered we left
each one for sixty to a hundred and
twenty seconds to allow the solvent to
do its work
after the waiting period we wiped each
one five times without applying too much
force we're evaluating how well the
solvent works not how hard we can press
down on a heatsink then to test we take
something very clean very fine so a
coffee filter in this case wipe it off
and boom that is how we collect our
results for each solvent on each type of
compound oh okay
we are done screwdrivers down and we
have the results okay most of them are
not very surprising but some of them are
basically here's how the grading works
if there's anything on the coffee filter
that's a fail so hydrogen peroxide I was
expecting another topical sanitizer to
do well no not so much beer epic fail
almost all of it stayed on the heatsink
Windex this one performed okay it did
leave a significant residue though so
we'll call that a c-minus hand sanitizer
so it is an alcohol-based sanitizer and
this actually performed really well so
there's at least one household item that
would work what quite well distilled
water was actually the worst not good
for cleaning off your CPU googan though
excellent result here we've got almost I
would say nothing on our coffee filter
arctic clean I mean this is a
purpose-designed cleaner so this one
performed perfectly as well and nail
polish remover this one came in real
well remember this is an
acetone based one though I wouldn't
expect the same results from a regular
one vodka okay guys so if you got to
clean your cpu with alcohol go with the
vodka not with the beer here's our
isopropyl alcohol I think we've put an
end once and for all to the debate
seventy percent versus ninety nine
percent we're going with doesn't frickin
matter coke was basically tied with
water and you get kind of a urine stain
looking thing on your on your paper
towel and the same goes with orange
juice except even more urine finally
we've got vinegar which worked actually
much worse than I expected barely
removing any of it and finally the
golden standard isopropyl 99% those fun
now let's do it all over again with that
next more here we go
Wow yep okay the intent was to use a
thermal compound that's a lot thinner
and mission frickin accomplished there
here we go
okay okay here we go
last one whoa three four five Wow
the beer actually performed shockingly
well with mx4 okay
let's get all the other results out here
and do the whole roundup then so for a
thin compound like mx4 freakin almost
everything worked
astonishing okay well that's isopropyl
99% we expected that to work but vodka
clean vinegar okay we got a couple
little flecks there but basically clean
beer beer worked hand sanitizer Windex
everything's got just like you know what
we would consider a negligible okay coke
didn't work especially well but Arctic
clean absolutely flawless that one looks
great here nail polish remover perfect
distilled water perfect sheesh hydrogen
peroxide perfect that was an epic fail
first time around 70% isopropyl looking
pretty good even orange juice worked
what leading us to coke which also
worked so the obvious question here then
is what could possibly go wrong while
removing a thin compound like mx4 and
let me show you you can pull the CPU out
of the socket when you go to lift the
heatsink off I had just done another
mount so that I could ah
Oh Oh what is that eight 1800 X Oh
terrible okay anyway the point is I had
done a final one so I could do a live
demo of how while what we've discovered
is that some household agents would work
to remove thermal compound another
perfectly viable method in a pinch is
straight-up elbow grease so here's one
two three four five of those and a
coffee filter and there's really not a
whole lot left so there you have it guys
how to remove thermal compound
everything from super sensible ways all
the way to stuff that makes no sense
whatsoever and how well they all worked
thank you for watching and please pray
for our 1,800 ex it is always so
confusing to me when I'm at the
supermarket and I see people spending

watching guys if you dislike this video
you can hit that dislike button but if
you liked it hit the like button get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description as a summary if
you're going for
compound removal we're thinking maybe
the isopropyl alcohol or the googan or
Arctic lien if you're just like a mad
baller and you like to you know whatever
spend a lot of money on removing thermal
compound also down there you'll find a
link to our t-shirt store as well as a
link to our community forum which you
should totally join you can go talk Tech
including how stupid this test was right
