rather interesting this is the pulse
wave to PC gaming headset it is
according to the manufacturer the most
versatile gaming headset ever made for
PC you can change modes on-the-fly
between USB 7.1 or stereo you have
evidently dynamic master control where I
think they're referring to this USB
sound card right here okay
virtual 7.1 surround featuring sonic
force feedback so these are not only USB
powered in terms of the amplification
and the sound card and the headphones
themselves but they're also USB powered
in the sense that they vibrate yes they
have vibration effects so you can feel
the explosions also featuring a
detachable microphone so this is made by
Tech in motion and let's move around to
the side where we can find a pulsating
blue green and red lights vibration
effects which we've covered already
stereo or virtual 7.1 surround so yes it
should be noted this is virtual 7.1
surround okay we have a padded headband
which obviously we'll find out once we
open it up let's see okay well here's
some specs that you guys may or may not
be interested in you can always pause it
and read the specs should you so desire
there you go
alright compatibility okay so Oh works
with Windows XP Vista and Windows 7
iPod and mp3 players any audio device
with a three-and-a-half millimeter so
that's interesting so it has the
versatility to not only be a USB headset
and but also to come in a box or a
blister pack which ever you should
prefer so I guess I get to do two
unboxings
well first of all one thing we find
inside the box here is a driver install
this with the user manual on the disc so
you might not want to throw that away
since it clearly has a user's manual on
it but the drivers I would definitely
recommend downloading the latest from
the C media or attacking motion website
C media is chipset maker of the onboard
sound card on the US
audio control device here okay so what
do we got really needs to come away
alright there we go we've got whatever
this is which I guess we did find out in
a while I'm trying to USB something or
other that's for sure okay on or off
you must be port Wow interesting
it comes with double sided velcro so you
can apparently attach that okay I may
need that there manual on the disc okay
go ahead roll inline controls okay go
away my keys here and let's have a look
at the pulse wave to PC gaming headset
so actually let's start with the jacks
that we have so there is our USB jack
you know what I'm gonna find out what
this is first I'll be just a moment
alright so the user manual reveals this
to be an external battery power pack so
you go ahead and you put four triple A's
in there you turn it on okay then you
can use the pulse wave to to its full
extent even if you're plugged into say
for example an mp3 player so you just go
ahead and you plug this guy into here
okay so then it's powered and then you
plug this green jack into your mp3
player or any other portable audio
device and you can get the vibration
effects which are triggered by bass as
well as the pulsating lights on the side
of the headset even if you are not
plugged in to your PC so that's pretty
cool alright actually hold on I missed
something in here I missed the
detachable mic which is here okay so
let's have a look at the overall unit
okay so we're using pretty standard cord
although it seems to be fairly stiff
engage
good we've got our microphone as well as
our headphone jacks all right we can
also plug in via USB to the back of the
PC and we can use it as a USB sound card
okay so using the control pod here all
you have to do is switch between USB and
standard mode so you're just basically
selecting which input you want to accept
a signal from so if you put it in USB
mode then your computer will detect it
as a C media audio device if you put it
in standard mode stereo mode whatever
you want to call it then you're just
going to use your analog jacks you can
use your own board sound card so this is
a complaint that I've had about USB
headsets in the past and that is that if
you have a decent sound card there's
pretty much no point using a USB headset
because your sound card is probably
better so in this case you can use the
USB for like if you're running on your
laptop or whatever where usually the
on-board is terrible and then you can
switch over to these if you're on your
desktop and you have a better sound card
so that's kinda handy okay vibe on usb
on you can mute your mic with this
button right here you've got volume
controls as well as vibe controls and
this one-two-three thing here I believe
these are base modes I'm just going to
double check that yes so sub mode one is
lights only sub mode two is lights and
vibration and sub mode three is
vibration only so that basically refers
to how the pulse wave to the the
vibrators as well as the lights on the
side are going to response to bass
signals that are being sent to them so
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to
attach the detachable mic here okay
there we are so you can see it's quite
flexible put that wherever you need to
put it you could put it like yeah
I'm here in your forehead if you felt
like it not pretty useful
it also comes off so you can tuck it
away or you can just leave it attached
all the time which is probably what
someone like me would do so just go fit
like that like this okay we've got a
plethora material on the inside of the
ear cups all right just some foam here
you can't really see the drivers
themselves unfortunately I do like to
show you guys that when I can
you can see there's quite a range of
flexibility so no matter what the shape
of your head is should be able to find a
fit that works for you also the headband
is adjustable so it adjusts quite a bit
so if you're very tall head that'll work
for you you know I'm very tall head it
should also work for you okay this isn't
quite as padded as I would typically
like to see but it's also not
uncomfortable especially because you can
adjust the size so that it doesn't put
too much pressure on you in any way
shape or form also a pleather you type
material with foam underneath and I
think that's pretty much it for the
overall external aesthetics of the
headset so I'm just gonna put my tripod
down and you guys I'm gonna model them
for you yeah just be a microphone and
also an eyepatch now I'm just kidding
it's just a microphone so you can see as
I mentioned before it is quite
adjustable indeed you can put it pretty
much wherever you see fit including
tucking it away over here so this is
what the headset looks like from the
side they're quite open I can hear
myself speaking quite easily which means
that not only will you be able to hear
sounds around you and one of the
recommended uses that they have for this
particular headset is to use it in USB
mode use Ventrilo or whatever speech app
that you use to map your friends voices
to your headset and then you can
actually still run your speakers off
your sound card so you would still be
able to hear the game sounds or rather
you speaker though for second yeah
you've run your speakers off your sound
card and then have your game sounds
mapped to that set of speakers so you
can hear the voices through your
headphones but then you can hear all the
game sounds through the headphones
outside so it's an easier way to hear
your friends if you're gaming on a team
for example oh yeah one thing I haven't
so you could clip it somewhere should
you so desire and I guess that's pretty
much I just wanted to show you guys what
it looks like when it is installed on a
user's head thank you for checking out
