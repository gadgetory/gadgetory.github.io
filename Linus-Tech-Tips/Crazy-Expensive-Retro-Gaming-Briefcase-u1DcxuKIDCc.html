arcade machine but a lot of you timed in
to tell us that throwing together
something with off-the-shelf parts from
well-known sources like Ulta mark and
North Coast custom arcades wasn't DIY
enough ok well what if I told you that
this was hand made a truly DIY creation
well it is and we're gonna have a look
at it after I tell you about our sponsor
Mac Weldon Mac Weldon believes in smart
design premium fabrics and simple
shopping use offer code tectus to get

okay so even though it looks the part
the carry 42 isn't really DIY so much as
it is someone else's DIY project that
turned into a product that he sent to us
and that someone is love Colton
a Swedish artist whose hand made a huge
selection of limited-production retro
gear some of this stuff is incredible
and he's even made PC cases so the carry
42 though is right up there with his
most exciting and beautiful ideas
it's short for carrier for two and ours
which was graciously loaned to us by mr.
Holten himself features a
mother-of-pearl inlay of MS and mr.
pacman on the outer casing that's
completely flush with the wood it's
entirely handcrafted from American
walnut with a vintage retro aesthetic
and the craftsmanship on it is
outstanding everything fits together
with a level of precision rarely seen in
wood for a commercial product anymore
and certainly with a higher level of
precision than we ended up with in our
own cabinet thanks to our amateur level
assembly and having to move it around
multiple times during construction
speaking of which the size comparison is
absolutely staggering let's go for a
tour of it so even the control deck of
our full-sized arcade machine Dwarfs the
carry 42 but it includes all of the
following a 12-inch 1024 by 768 display
twin 10 watt speakers a humble Raspberry
Pi running retropie with some pre-loaded
customizations a diminutive 16 gig USB
flash drive that contains a handful of
games of dubious legality and a USB port
to plug it into allowing you then to add
your own less dubious ROM files should
you please
while we're back here you might notice
that there are no fewer than two HDMI
ports and six and a half millimeter
headphone jacks well essentially these
ones are outputs these ones are inputs
and then inside the box are small patch
cables that connect them for use with
the included screen and speakers so in
theory you
could connect this up to an external
display and a pair of headphones or even
a TV and receiver for a much bigger
picture and sound experienced though in
practice not everything is as it seems
more on that later something you might
have noticed missing back here is an
obvious way to keep the lid upright
while you're playing
and that's remedied with this here
twisty pulley thing just grab it pull it
out twist it and it's locked in place
there are three separate angles you can
prop it up at I think the only thing
that could make this thing more Swedish
is a yellow and blue color scheme I love
it but it isn't purely a piece of art
right how about the gaming experience
well we got off to a pretty good start
the buttons and sticks are sharp and
responsive the speaker's can get pretty
loud though they are clearer and sound
better in general at lower volumes
thanks to the Box acting as kind of a
wooden reverb chamber but as for the
screen well for starters it's a TN
screen with pretty terrible viewing
angles meaning that the two-player
experience is best enjoyed with a very
close friend or romantic partner and
there's also some pretty severe motion
blur that while it's something you can
get used to it's far from ideal
especially in shoot-'em-ups
and this is all before we get to what
was our biggest out-of-the-box issue the
input latency now thankfully that was
something that can be controlled to a
small degree by entering the underlying
emulator and making some configuration
changes however these changes really
should have been the default settings
while we're in here though something
else retro gamers might not appreciate
is the blurry linear filtering effect
enabled by default it makes sense here
since the screen isn't super high res
and the stock effect is too curved the
screen to match the bezel and it might
have even masked some of the ghosting a
bit but we personally preferred our
approach where some clever shader work
can make for a far cleaner more
appealing image that more closely
resembles an old CRT so once again this
problem was mostly solved bringing us to
the one that we couldn't fix
the speakers remember that six and a
half millimeter headphone jack well
that's not for the speakers it's
actually power for the LCD and the power
led which we only discovered when we
went to try plugging headphones in and
got a loud buzzing and a blank screen
oops the speaker's ended up being driven
by HDMI which would be fine except that
they were rewired for mono now some
games notably arcade games and 16-bit
games do actually run in stereo and so
does retropie by default resulting in
actually missing sound effects after and
also config tweak our games at least had
all of the sounds instead of just the
left channel but this is again something
we felt could have been done better
with all of that said though these are
problems that are probably only going to
bother purists bringing us back to the
real reason the carry 42 exists to be an
artistic piece for retro gaming
enthusiasts and collectors and if we
look at it through that lens even though
it's not perfect it does work out of the
box and casual gamers likely wouldn't
notice anything was wrong
now that doesn't translate into a
recommendation that you go out and buy
one of these especially considering that
it's powered by a PI and the asking
price for a base unit without the inlay
is 2599 euro + vit but if you're the
kind of person who just straight-up
doesn't give a crap about money and I
know you guys are out there there are
only 50 of them in the world
and mr. Hilton's craftsmanship is
something that cannot be denied here and
that beauty and scarcity is what you're
really paying for here not the hardware
and software which by the way we would
love to be consulted on next time
speaking of being consulted ahead of
time tunnel bear VPN has really gone off
the rails on these integration reads I
love these guys have you ever been
camping and thought I really hope I'm
not gonna get attacked by bears well of
course you haven't
who goes can't
who's watching this channel how are you
supposed to set the land party in the
woods but let's say you were going
camping and you did well good news bears
aren't actually aggressive by Nature
black bears tend to run away from
threats and hide in trees brown bears on
the other hand can be aggressive but
that's as a last resort if they feel
like they can't escape
so don't poke bears don't try to hug
them or take selfies with them they hate
that interestingly though some bears
like to protect your online privacy in
fact tunnel bears like protecting
privacy so much they can be found in
over 20 countries worldwide working
their way through firewalls getting
around censorship and helping people
enjoy a more open Internet get your own

/l TT so thanks for watching guys that
this video sucked you know what to do
but if is awesome get subscribed hit the

where the buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also linked down
there is our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
