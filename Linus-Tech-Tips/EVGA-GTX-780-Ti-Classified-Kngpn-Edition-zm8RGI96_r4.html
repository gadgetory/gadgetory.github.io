gaming PC look no further than the
obsidian series 250 d from Corsair click
now to learn more the EVGA geforce gtx
780 Ti kingpin Edition it comes with a
10 72 megahertz base clock and 11 37
megahertz boost clock but all of that is
totally irrelevant because it is
designed for balls to the walls
overclocking anyway it's got three gigs
of gddr5 clocked at 7 gigahertz and it
costs a hundred and fifty dollars more
than a bass card so what do you get for
your money well first up you get a six
heat pipe dual 100 millimeter fan cooler
with a removable pwm heatsink it's that
little red yuna sync down there next up
you get a unique translucent ACX cooler
design so the regular one is black this
one is different
it supports the usual Nvidia technology
so sli up to 4-way g-sync shield game
streaming GPU boost 2.0 cuda and for
concurrent displays and this one also
has some unusual stuff so in the box
along with the usual case badge poster
stickers driver disk and manual is an
overclocking guide sexy sleeved PCIe
power adaptors and a replacement thermal
pad because you never know when you're
going to need a replacement thermal pad
what else is special about this well its
uses a completely non reference PCB with
a 14 plus three-phase power design so
that's 14 phases GPU three phases Ram
capable of delivering up to 450 watts of
power which I guess explains the dual
eight pin and single 6 pin PCI Express
power connectors on the top of the card
it also has on the top of the card an
Ellen 2 BIOS which as well as a pro bit
header and included adapter that allows
you to use a multimeter instead of
software for voltage monitoring right
next to that we've got speaking of
voltage monitoring LED indicators that
show the voltage health for the GPU Ram
PLL and 3.3 volt and 12-volt power
inputs when we move around to the back
of the card I guess there's also SLI
connectors up there when we move around
to the back of the card we find an evbot
header so that is hardware level
real-time voltage and clock speed
adjustments that can be made with the
evbot dongle that's available from EVGA
and then the last thing you know I guess
there's like there's a cool you know
backplate on it the last thing is not in
the box but it's more of an available
thing EK has a classified edition
waterblock that will work on the kingpin
edition card and of course there are
kingpins own liquid nitrogen cooling
pots if you do decide to get even more
extreme than that okay line this this is
a cool card but what about Nvidia green
light the voltages and clock speeds will
be limited for warranty purposes right
out of the box perhaps but I think
kingpin himself put it best mm-hmm quote
unquote do you think I would put my name
on a locked-down card he said this card
was engineered to serve one purpose to
be the world's best overclocking
graphics card expect GPU clock speeds
over 1.85 gigahertz with extreme cooling
so I'll refer to the official owners
club thread here where you can easily
find unofficial tools because out of the
box it's going to be limited unofficial
tools to completely unlock the card and
release it from any manufacturer
limitations you will be limited by
physics not by safety with this graphics
card which means that while you VGA has
a three year warranty if you do need to
return it to them for some reason you
will need to do so with the stockpile
stock cooling and everything back in out
of box condition but whatever you do
with it in between it arriving and then
coming back to them in out of box
condition is your own thing now to be
clear guys around here we're not Vince
we're not kingpin we're not
liquid-nitrogen overclockers but frankly
not many people are so we wanted to take
a bit of a different approach through
this we decided to take some of these
unofficial unlocking tools and see how
far we can go with this on air versus a
normal 780ti that cost one hundred and
fifty dollars less if we fully unlock it
and we use the you know voltage
modification tool to go as high as it
possibly can
compared to our regular 780ti so I'll be
handing it off to Luke wish him luck
I've called a lot of things beasts
throughout the times that I've been on
video
but I think it's pretty hard to get this
close to the actual definition of bass
this card is ridiculous it's running at
1333
megahertz on the core clock as
overclocked it as it is right now and
about 7700 megahertz
on memory both of those things are
ridiculous and we're using an unofficial
/ volting tool which is unofficially
linked below the unofficial video that
you're watching right now which will
take you to an unofficial place to
download the unofficial application
which will unofficially over volt your
card which I unofficially recommend you
do for this card I also recommend
jumping it into ln2 BIOS because you'll
unlock many more of the goodies and be
able to play with the actual
capabilities of this card without
jumping into that BIOS you're going to
be hampered by many things that are
cramping you down cramping your style
and not letting you overclock as much as
you possibly could and this thing does
it extremely well when you're looking at
the numbers on-screen try to remember
that we're pretty sure our 780ti
reference Edition is probably quite
golden of a sample and is a little bit
higher than kind of the average that
I've seen around so this would normally
be a higher difference than you're
seeing in the graphs here but this is
how our cards bench at what they're
normally clocked at speaking of normally
clocked at you can check the
overclocking cheat in the link down
below that is definitely an official
link not unofficial like the other link
that's down there and you can check out
exactly how our cards are clocked and
exactly how they're running for this one
we actually have voltage readouts from a
multimeter so you can see exactly how
much volts are running because this card
sports pin out which is actually really
cool thank you for watching the video
like and dislike this video based on are
you interested in this kind of card or
you kind of waiting for Maxwell to come
out are you waiting for things in the
future are you jumping on it right now
comment down below with that and maybe
comment on the forums too you'll get a
lot more interaction there like normal
always subscribe to Linus tech tips and
just in case you haven't seen in the
last little while our star citizen group
is ranked number one on activity right
now so check that out on the forum -
