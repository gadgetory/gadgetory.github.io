with our recent change to the style of
our video titles and thumbnails would be
a gross understatement
and I want to get right into a
discussion about that after the sad
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel there the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description honestly it's kind of
hard to know where to start with
something like this trolling you guys by
playing up the greedy corporate shill
perception that some of you have of me
probably wasn't the right approach but
joking about things is usually how I
break the ice when I'm about to have an
awkward conversation and this is going
to be a little awkward I screwed up the
video title of our recent raiven 3 and
risin 5 performance preview which was
initially called AMD risin 5 and 3
tested and then AMD risin 5 and 3
previewed we shouldn't have said we
tested them because we were actually
using a different CPU to simulate their
performance and even preview upon
further reflection wasn't quite right
since what we were previewing was the
performance that we expected from the
chips rather than the chips themselves
so I could spin that as an experiment to
see where the threshold was for audience
tolerance for our new thumbnails and
titles there would be some truth to that
we are constantly making small tweaks
but this this is honest answers and
these videos wouldn't have much value if
I didn't shoot straight so here it is in
this case I didn't think it was a big
deal to draw viewers in with an
admittedly misleading title because I
was so confident in our testing
methodology and I was so confident that
the viewers who I would draw in with
such a title would turn out to be amped
to see the benchmarks that we worked so
hard on to say that backfired would be
putting it pretty mildly and the damage
is actually deeper than it appears on
the outside one positive takeaway here
is that I did get
absolute confirmation of my theory that
there's been a major shift in the way
that YouTube handles dislikes or more
accurately the way that YouTube handles
the like to dislike ratio so my previous
understanding was that both of them were
weighted about equally and there are
examples of viral hugely successful
videos in the past that seemed to have
backed up this belief but we got to
watch in this case in real time as
YouTube buried this video about 10
minutes after it went live and the
effect of YouTube doing something like
that lasts four days on a channel so
then I guess at this point some of you
are expecting that what comes next is in
on my knees apology and a solemn promise
to never again make a silly face or
press the forbidden key again and to go
back to the good old days of working out
of the garage hey you guys can you some
healthy audios and thumbnails with white
text on a screen capture of b-roll from
the video but while there are aspects of
that approach that I prefer both as a
consumer and a creator of content it's
not going to happen and there are a lot
of reasons why some of it is that
nostalgia glasses don't actually work
very well blades of Steel is fun but is
it really a good game by today's
standards and our old unboxing videos
are similarly fun but they contain very
little actual information change has
been a very good thing for the density
of information that we're able to
present I mean is it possible if you
don't like it anymore that the tech
industry changed or maybe you as an
individual have changed in the last
eight years just as much as we have but
a much bigger factor is this using
so-called cancerous thumbnails allows
our videos to stand out better in a
search result or
suggested video paint gaining up new
viewers which is very beneficial for
obvious reasons the cold hard truth is
that if everyone is doing this there's
probably a reason it works
and while I've seen every argument Under
the Sun I read almost all the comments
on our videos for why it's bad the cold
hard truth is that none of them really
hold any water number one you're big
enough you don't need more views what
think about what it would mean if we
stopped growing YouTube as a platform is
growing PC gaming in particular is
growing us being happy with stagnant
viewership
in a growing world would be kind of like
your grandpa being happy with the same
$3 an hour he made back in 1950
unacceptable number two people hate it
you'll drive away your core audience
well there is no doubt that some people
hate it but most of the empirical
evidence we've seen suggests that this
is a very vocal minority to be clear
unsubscribed
do happen they're common we've lost more
subscribers on LTT than most youtube
channels will ever have but this is a
natural thing people's interest change
maybe they even died but the massive
waves of unsubscribes as a reaction to a
particular piece of content are much
rarer than the comment section would
have you believe 3 you're pandering to
kids by making these bases ok there are
two fundamental problems with this one
number one who cares adult enthusiasts
you know grown-ups should be able to see
a silly face without it ruining their
day and should be pleased as punch that
someone is out there creating content
that gets younger people excited and
passionate about technology and - it's
nonsense our demographics you older
today than they ever have so consider
that one debunked and honestly I could
go on and on but the bottom line is this
video production is really expensive
when you believe that your staff should
be comfortable happy and well
compensated then you put that money
where your mouth is so with the
significant investment already made into
making every piece of content we do
another 20 minutes on a thumbnail that
can boost be worshiped by no kidding up
to 20 percent is a no-brainer and in
response to what I'm sure is coming next
you guess you the one writing an essay
about how being a youtuber isn't a real
job we shouldn't have all this overhead
we should just do it out of passion like
we used to one a job is anything you can
get paid to do and we're doing ok some
of us even wear decent clothes to to jog
your memory I used to work at a computer
store in fact every single person in
this video has been paid to make - Texas
videos since the moment they started
making line effective videos so that
hasn't changed
leading us to number 3 of course we're
passionate are you kidding there are a
lot of things that I would rather not
stress about like commercial property
leases insurance equipment breakage
taxes scheduling dealing with staff
vacation time but I do all of this crap
that I don't enjoy because I am
passionate about making the best videos
we can and about running a real business
that has allowed us to make seven gamers
or ultimate death pcs scrapyard wars
projects that wouldn't have been
possible if I was still hand canning
unboxings in a parking lot with Luke
you can criticize me for plenty of stuff
but slam me for lacking passion I mean
you're probably the same people asking
why I built my own server room instead
of hiring someone to do it properly
because I love playing with this stuff
what do you think I'd do it if I wasn't
personally passionate about making tech
videos there would be no reason for me
to make an embarrassing face in a
thumbnail to try and grow this company
you think I want it explain to my kids
why I'm always looking like this
honestly do I really even seem like the
kind of person who needs a lot of
material things to be happy do you think
this is about the money I live in the
same house I Drive the same car and I
wear the same abominable cheap footwear
that I always did the only fancy stuff
in my life is my tech gadget just like
before I ever set foot in front of a
camera do you know what a lack of
passion would actually look like
plotting away day after day at the same
kinds of videos in the same format with
the same presentation do you have any
idea how easily I can rattle off a power
supply unboxing do you have any idea how
much faster it is to generate our old
thumbnails which coming back then to the
beginning of our little chat doesn't
mean that we haven't ever taken it too
far so here is my proposal to help us
communicate with each other better
unfortunately I need to keep going like
this and titling our videos in a way
that allows us to adapt to how viewers
are discovering new content but I won't
mislead you if I say you won't believe
this bizarre keyboard you won't believe
it and what I'm asking for in return is
this one try to understand our position
we can't ignore the changes in the way
that viewers are brow
and content on YouTube if the title is
representative of the content world's
ugliest keyboard it isn't
even if it shares some stylistic aspects
with clickbait it isn't by the very
definition click fate it's awful and I'd
appreciate if you could look past a
little bit of edginess and avoid
painting us with the same brush as folks
putting boobs in their thumbnails of
videos about cars and not cars and
scoops just regular cars and number two
if you want to communicate with us do it
in a way that's meaningful honestly I
couldn't tell if this thumbnail thing
was a serious problem or just more
background noise from haters like yet
whatever the hell prompted 500 people to
dislike this this really cool piece of
content where we took the time to
benchmark ten years of video cards there
was a lot of time or the look like this
truckload of poorly researched comments
informing me that my server room is
flammable try this if there's something
that you liked about the video help us
then help us drown out the peanut
gallery with all alike and an on topic
comment we really do read those and
these things boost search rankings and
suggested video placements
