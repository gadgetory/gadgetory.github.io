to learn more hey guys for those of you
that don't know me my name's slick I've
been using Android for about three and a
half years now and I've been challenged
to do a blackberry I switched for 30
days so I'm gonna try out the Zed 10
we'll see how this goes first thing
anyone notices about a phone is the
physical aspects of the phone so it is
kind of a large phone but that's totally
fine for me because I do have large
hands so it's not actually an issue for
me the only thing that I can find that I
don't like about it it has a good weight
to it
I like phones that weigh a bit and I
like the back a lot the texture on the
back is nice but I don't actually like
that the plugs are on the side that's a
preference thing so some people might
like that but if I'm gonna put my phone
in like the cup holder of my car or
somewhere else where it's sitting in
something then being on the side might
be a hindrance because if I put it down
like that
the cable could hit the side of the cup
of my car or whatever so I'm not
actually a huge fan of the cables being
on the side but it's not really the end
of the world mic plug-in power on the
top and then you've got volume over here
you can take off the back right there
and the battery is kind of cool but
other than that there's nothing that
interesting back here except for your SD
card I haven't had a ton of experience
with the camera right there I've taken a
few pictures I took some inside of a
hockey rink threw glass down to the
hockey rink and those looked great but
then I took some in my room that was
closer lit and those didn't look as
great but then that was with no custom
settings or anything going on so I'm not
too sure about that
the next thing you'll notice about it is
I did talk about its size but if you
look at its screen which is quite large
you'll likely notice that it looks kind
of gross right now I did just try to
clean it off and I do actively try to
clean it off for anyone that watches the
live streams you'll notice that if I
ever have my phone out I'm constantly
rubbing it on like the pant leg of my
pants or whatever because I do like
because I do like keeping it clean and
that's actually a problem with this
phone because I cannot get fingerprints
or anything off of it no matter how many
times I try it's actually kind of crazy
but when the screen is on you might be
able to see it better because of
reflection I can't actually
the fingerprints quite as much when the
screens on but again due to reflection
you might be able to when you first turn
the screen on you'll notice the
notifications here it's actually quite
nice piece I can see I have five emails
one Facebook notification in two general
notifications so it's kind of C's cool
so I can see what's happening if I'm
waiting for an email I can actually see
it come in without individually going
into checking my email then they have a
come on screen turn off they have a nice
quick feature to get to your BlackBerry
hub which is the integration of all your
different social networks email all that
kind of stuff which is swiping up and to
the right you'll notice that didn't work
I wish that worked from this screen but
you have to swipe the screen away well
I'm already there wait a second there we
go this is what you'd normally get to
just I was already on that and then if
you go from the bottom and go to the
right it brings up your BlackBerry hub I
kind of wish you did it from the home
screen but I forgive it because
blackberry hub is just kind of fantastic
it integrates all of your social media
it integrates all of your emails you can
have multiple emails on it it integrates
your blackberry messenger text messages
everything so I actually really like
that a lot you can see everything in
order as it comes in on the list which
is fantastic because if you're just
trying to quickly go through all your
social media or text messages or
whatever you can quickly jump over here
do all that jump back out and go away
one thing I've noticed with black rice
so far is efficiency is kind of their
deal which is just absolutely awesome
I noticed the forum's down that's not a
good email to get I'll have to jump on
that after this video another thing if
you click on the hub button in the
bottom left-hand corner I'm gonna cover
this up so you guys don't see my
personal email you can see you can go
individually to different sections so
notifications bbm text messages email
whatever you want just when to go back
to hub and then there it's no longer the
list of everything it's the individual
list for that app or whatever you have
so say it's email you word directly to
your email and then it's just your email
so if you know you want to go to email
you can go individually to that or if
you just want to see everything at once
you're right into the hub I actually
really like this and it's very very fast
to get to so again efficiency and
getting things done on time is
a big point with this film as far as the
App Store goes this is day one and I
have not spent much time in the App
Store have mainly been using the social
media stuff and email and all that kind
of stuff but the first thing I noticed
was that there isn't actually a Skype
app I've done a search here you can see
there's no Skype app I don't know that
many people that use Skype a crazy
amount on their phones personally I'm
sure people do but I do a lot because I
use it for interfacing with my moderator
team on the forums so we have a personal
Skype chat so we can all keep in contact
with each other very quickly to get
things done quickly and I have that push
to my phone so that I can always see
what's going on if anything major
happens I can check it up so it's
actually kind of a big bummer that they
don't have Skype chat yeah I had like I
said Adam so much time in the App Store
so hopefully other stuff is there but
Skype wasn't so that was a bummer I
don't know how big of a deal this is
it's not actually that important but you
don't have to press the button on the
top to activate your phone if you touch
below the screen and slide up the phone
will turn on and you can do your full
swipe right from there which is kind of
cool but makes it that if you're
cleaning it like I said earlier the
screen gets very dirty very easily if
you're cleaning it and and you go to rub
it and it can detect your finger through
the other side again it's not really a
big deal but the screen goes like crazy
you might it'll unlock itself and you
might click something and stuff starts
opening and it goes nuts while you're
trying to clean it so it's not really
that big of a deal but it's just kind of
weird when you go to clean your phone
and the screen goes absolutely nuts
again there's only day one so I haven't
had a ton of time with this just a cat
right there sorry if you're looking over
that but the I've heard of this before I
actually got the phone but there's kind
of a bedside mode that I've heard of and
I thought it was kind of interesting I
thought it was just kind of a low-power
thing I didn't know a ton about it no it
doesn't just to be clear about that I
have used it but it didn't open up for
now if I can guarantee that
so what it actually does is with instead
of swiping up on this screen when you
swipe down it brings down the debt
bedside mode which as you can see is not
actually pornhub it's a clock so I don't
know what you're into but you might be
into that Wow
you can turn on the alarm and off the
alarm quickly and easily by swiping
right here and if you want to change the
time you just click right on the time
change it to exactly what you want go
back and you're good to go one thing I
noticed is that when you're sliding
things away very common feature with
blackberry is that if you're in an app
if you want to go away you throw it away
that's kind of just how it works there's
no physical buttons there's no major
featured on-screen buttons except for
like phone search and camera so if
you're in say music and you need to get
out it's not a single button that you
press or anything like that it's a
single swipe throw away one thing I
noticed about this is unlike say Android
there doesn't seem to be momentum on
your flick so you can't just kind of
throw it off oh that actually works but
it doesn't usually do that I usually
have to take it all the way off so I
noticed I noticed as I do this I get
kind of the feeling that I'm like I'm
done with you
get out of here and it kind of reminds
me of like the snobby businessman he's
like blackberry I'm done with your music
get it away from me I have other things
to do I'm busy so I don't know terrible
that's what that was and I'm sick so
please mind me I am always sick so again
like with the hub ties into the
professionalism thing you're done with
something it gets out of the way there's
no like slowly closing and all that kind
of stuff it's you throw it away it's
done it brings you to this screen which
is recent applications so if you only do
kind of like four things on your phone
you can very easily jump into say music
like I just said throw it away and then
jump on to something else that you do
all the time
so that's actually pretty cool there you
have ficient brings up the same thing I
was talking about before so I go to a
web page let's say home of much which
MuchMusic is apparently one of their
default web pages I didn't even know
that existed so I'm hoping this will
rotate there we go
do you notice the lag time in there this
is kind of weird I've had it a few times
where I go to turn it and then by that
time I've kind of done it again because
I'm waiting for it to actually like come
on come on like I'm kind of expecting it
to go a lot faster so it's just kind of
interesting how it takes a little while
because the phone isn't slow but the
rotation is slow here's a HTC one for
contrast like it's quick it jumps really
quickly if you go like this on a one I'm
assuming it just kind of goes nuts
yeah if I did that on this phone it
wouldn't actually ever make a rotation
oh oh oh
but I'm vertical it's the wrong way so I
don't know that's kind of weird there is
a rotation lock but then this section
right here the like recent app things
will save if you had it rotated so say
if I go browser and then rotate it and
then flick it away then go back browser
still rotated it's again not really that
big of an issue but it's just kind of
weird it's like no I'm this way now
always quality I have had I think one
phone call with this I'll hopefully be
having more soon I don't have my
personal sim in here so it's kind of
interesting calling people but voice
quality sounded fine like I said I've
only used it once so reception was fine
for that time I was using it but I
haven't really it was here like it was
in the house and we're in kind of a big
area so I wouldn't expect a reception to
be bad
32 I'm already like Antron deprived so
that will be interesting I have
everything on my phone set up exactly
how I want it I have everything exactly
where I want it to be so now being on a
completely different device is just kind
of weird and the only smartphone
technology that I've ever used is
Android so again being away from it it's
kind of weird so inside my comfort zone
but we'll see I do like certain things
like the hub is kind of awesome so I'm
not that worried about like my emails of
text messages and stuff but I am worried
about things like having access to Skype
I didn't really look for it but I didn't
see an official reddit app I don't like
the screen rotation how fast it is but
then usually I just lock my screen
rotation anyways so I'm not super
worried about that worry about app
support but I think I might have already
said that a couple of times I'm very
worried about have support right that
makes sense the phone seems fine like
the the actual calling features of the
phone I'm on a Bell sim that seems fine
I don't think I'm gonna have any
problems with that I don't know anyone
else who has a blackberry that I know of
so I don't know how much bbm I'm gonna
be able to do but from what I hear it's
awesome so I'm probably gonna be missing
out more instead of actually being able
to do it um I had to go and download
Google Talk but that's totally fine and
Google Talk integrates with hub again so
that's totally awesome
I guess there's all this up so you guys
can actually see what I'm talking about
but yeah Google Talk actually integrates
with hub so I had to download from the
App Store it was there it had a really
low rating I don't know why I think it
had like two and a half stars works
perfectly not sure what's going on there
it didn't have that many ratings so that
might be part of the problem um yeah I
think that's about it so hopefully in a
few more days or a week or something
I'll have more to actually talk about as
I will have used it more um but yeah -
is coming over have a feeling he's gonna
do something okay so in case you didn't
notice I was operating the camera there
it's probably made a terrible yeah we'll
see rape rape alliances cam
skills in the coments there's nothing I
can do about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
