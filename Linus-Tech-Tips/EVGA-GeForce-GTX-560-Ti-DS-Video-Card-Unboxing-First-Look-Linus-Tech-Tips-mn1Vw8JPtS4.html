this is part of EVGA 's DS series of
cards that is not to say that it is like
the Nintendo DS in that it's neat but
underpowered that is to say that it is I
actually don't know what it stands for
but all there DS cards have this really
cool heatsink design so maybe it has
something to do with that
I don't know dual slot mind you all the
heat sinks are dual slot these days
pretty much dual dual fan would be DF
maybe someone can post in the comments
under this video what exactly the DS
thing in the name stands for so this is
basically a gtx 560 TI with an
aftermarket cooler made by EVGA who is
proud to proclaim themselves to be
number one seller of us of nvidia based
products in the u.s. the number one in
reliability and service the number one
in performance and the number one
folding at home team although I don't
think I should talk too much about the
folding at home team because NCIX has
its own folding at home team which is
pretty good as well so that you've got
24/7 support as well as EVGA a coveted
warranty service alright key features
include DirectX 11 we've come to expect
that at this point all the usual Nvidia
stuff including two-way SLI
cuda physx 3d vision as well as 3d
vision surround if you grab two of them
and run them in SLI mode you can use
EVGA utilities including precision as
well as their OC scanner and let's flip
it around this is a super clocked card
which means it's not the highest priced
highest performing it's not the second
highest for a second highest performing
but it's the step-up from the stock
o'clock cards that are also available so
we've got one of those EVGA skull dude
posters which I often have a really hard
time getting unfolded for some reason
let's see if this one is any easier
hey there we go alright so I'm just
going to step back show you guys that so
something about EVGA gaming there you go
you feed your gaming and then ask all
dude okay so let's go ahead and put that
away for now if I can figure out how to
do it
usually the putting away part is even
harder
there we are and without ruining it
excellent okay next we have any graphics
card user guide at this point you should
probably pretty much know how to use a
graphics card you plug it into the slot
you install the drivers but not off the
disk off the manufacturer website as
well as a quick start guide in case you
want to get started quickly rather than
slowly highly recommended that getting
started quickly rather than slowly
because your new hardware is in your
system and ready to go more quick
alright we have don't touch your card
for two minutes after it's been on we
have a mini HDMI to HDMI cable this is a
great inclusion because it allows you to
not have to do this any clearance issues
replace adapters if you have a DVI cable
plugged into the next slot over we have
dual molex to single 6 pin PCI adapter
as well as another one and finally a DVI
to VGA adapter finally we have the card
itself coming out of the wrapper which
is an unwrapping
video today not an unboxing I mean we
unboxed it too but we're also gonna
unwrap rate its unboxing and unwrapping
video there it is if that's not a slick
looking card I don't know what is I
think my white balance is a little bit
off because looking at the LCD in my
camera this green stripe looks pretty
yellow but in real life it's actually ah
there we go if I should there that's
about what it looks like so it's an
NVIDIA green stripe that looks very
sharp it's a nice little accent on an
otherwise almost completely black card
okay we got white DVI ports too but I
guess we'll let it slide
a couple stickers alright so let's start
with let's start with the top today
the EVGA GTX 560 Ti the text is in the
correct orientation such that when you
actually install it in your case you
will actually be able to read it on the
top we also find a single sli connector
so that means two-way SLI but not 3-way
or four-way SLI remember those modes are
not supported by the gtx 560 TI GPU next
on the back we have not a whole lot to
speak of although maybe what I'll do is
I'll find out for you guys whether this
is a reference PCB or whether this is a
custom PCB why don't you go find another
560 TI hmm there's a hawk it's not a 560
TI yes it is okay so I'm in the tech
tips room trying to find out if this is
a reference card or a non reference
scribe so far it looks like a reference
card all right let's compare the PCB
layouts here guys that's looking pretty
darn reference to me at this point now
remember to just because of
manufacturers using a reference design
PCB that does not necessarily mean that
they are using all reference components
on it so they could be using
higher-quality capacitors or chokes or
whatever the case may be
EVGA is renowned for their quality so
who knows what's actually on here but it
does use a reference PCB next we have an
open slot at the back so some airflow is
going to be kicked out into your case by
the DS cooler here we've also got two
PCI 6 pin PCI e6 pin power connectors
although it's not a particularly
power-hungry cars at the bottom we have
a PCI Express 16 X connector and we see
a couple of big old fat heat pipes so
lore there are two heat pipes no.33 heat
pipes yes there you can see the third
one in there now right so you got three
heat pipes covering the GPU which you
can also see right down there see the
GPU itself and so those are going to be
spreading the heat out to the aluminum
fins which you can see all under the
dual eighty millimeter fans here and
that is what we'll do the cooling for
your system you can also see that the
VRMs are going to get direct airflow
from this fan right here so you don't
have to worry about those overheating at
all as well as one of the things that is
superior about a downdraft cooler design
now one of the disadvantages is that
although we do on the back have the open
PCI slot for exhaust most of the air is
not going to come out of that slot most
of it is going to be exhausted here here
here not it here well yes I'm here and
then some of it will go out the back but
you want to make sure you have decent
cooling in your case before you install
a card that does not exhaust everything
externally on the back dual DVI mini
HDMI and I think that pretty much covers
it thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the geforce gtx 560 TI DS
