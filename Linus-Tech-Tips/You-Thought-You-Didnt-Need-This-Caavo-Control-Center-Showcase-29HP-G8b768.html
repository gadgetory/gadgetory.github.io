other day because I thought but even
though there's so many ways to watch TV
these days from who Lowe to HBO now to
like soon there's gonna be a Disney one
for kids and even though most of these
are about 10 bucks a month I still
figured that most people would probably
only really use like one or two of them
Netflix and YouTube prime video and
Showtime or Plex and maybe some kind of
thing that's useful for watching sports
but then I found out that there are a
lot of people out there who use way more
than that like even our cameraman Dave
who pays for Netflix Amazon Prime crave
and YouTube premium and those are just
apps these days even the hardware is
starting to get original series like
Apple TV's carpool karaoke now the
problem is that as these services get
more unique and non-overlapping content
it starts to get hard to remember not
only which service has what shows but
even just to find the content that you
want to watch well enter the sponsor of
today's showcase kaavo the kaavo control
center is one device that can manage all
of your content and one extra bonus is
that you cannot lose the remote they're
intrigued I can tell
allow me to demonstrate the core value
proposition of the kaavo control center
watch the man in the high castle and
boom it brings it up you can see in the
fine print there that it's prompting us
to watch on Amazon Prime but that show
is an Amazon original series so what
about a show that's available on
multiple services watch friend season 4
episode 7 don't critique my taste now
first of all being able to search
episode by episode is pretty awesome
because you can't do that yet with your
Google home so that's a bonus and if I
click on it it actually gives me the
option of watching on any one of my
three installed platforms here right now
a lot of you are probably thinking by
this point yeah I don't really have any
trouble remembering you know which media
service my various content is on but to
me the big selling point here is the
wife and kids factor so it's a hundred
bucks upfront and then two dollars a
month for the service but it makes it
much less likely that you'll have to run
over and open a show for someone when
you're in the middle of making dinner or
whatever now of course when you have so
much content at your fingertips targeted
searching isn't your only problem you
also have to decide what to watch in the
first place which in my house is
definitely like a key part of movie
night like there's like half of it is
figuring out what movie to watch then
the other half is actually watching half
of the movie because then it's time to
put the kids to bed anyway that's
neither here no there and that's why
kaavo has this dashboard of curated
lists that are made by editors
tastemakers and other kaavo users kind
of like how you can share playlists on
Spotify except you can make your list
out of any combination of TV shows
movies live TV it doesn't matter where
the content comes from or what it is and
then you can either keep your lists
private or you can share them with the
community and be like an influencer or
something now at the core of all this
functionality is that little box you
know what let's bring the box over here
wonderful there we go this little box
which is basically an HDMI 2.0 hub
meaning spork' at 60 Hertz
it's got HDR pass-through and support
for Dolby Atmos and it can support for
connected devices at once now kaavo had
an original product before this one that
had more i/o but was also quite a bit
more expensive and what they found was
this was kind of the sweet spot in terms
of what most people want connected to
their TV so guys leave a comment below
let us know how many devices you have
connected to your TV actually I'd love
to know what they are - interesting
stuff for my own bathroom reading now
setup is one of the areas that in my
opinion they seem to have spent a lot of
time on because it's really easy and by
the time you're done the control center
will have recognized all of your
connected devices and made them
compatible with the included remote so
you don't need all of these anymore
since the Cobo remote can control your
game console and even your sound bar as
long as it connects via HDMI or you can
connect the kaavo to your TV via HDMI
and then connect the TV to your sound
bar or a VR via RCA or an optical cable
ok so then this remote it's very
powerful important what happens if you
lose it well if you're one of those
people who spends their evenings talking
to an Amazon echo or a Google home then
you might not even notice since the
control center supports integration from
both voice assistance so you can do
things like ok goog le sorry I'm not
gonna do that inactivate all your guys
stuff ok Google raise the volume or a Li
X a switch to Roku or whatever the case
may be and it even has a function where
you can ask Google to find your remote
little beep and stuff or I mean if
you're a light like me and I don't
actually have a Google home then you can
press this button and it'll also do that
so thanks for watching guys and thanks
to kaavo for sponsoring this video their
control center is available for
Americans starting October 1st from Best
Buy Amazon and their own web site kaavo
comm with no ETA yet for other regions
