covering it passively cooled ZBOX an
entry-level Z box and a new nvme drive
thank you to Squarespace for bringing us
to CES 2016 this year and check out that
link in the video description down below
so we're gonna start with the zotac c
series this is their passively cooled
model and they've had these in the past
but this one's much larger and has a
much more badass CP unit so this one
specifically is running an Intel Core i5
6300 you skylake which is a big step
above I believe the i3 is that they had
in the smaller models that does require
much more metal due to the heatsinks
than that will plate this in the top and
all that kind of stuff so it does have
some weight to it but they did say that
the final version will be a little bit
lighter than it was here so I'm not
going to quote the weight and I wouldn't
look too closely at the size either
because they're saying it's gonna get a
little bit smaller as well do the
previously mentioned processor it also
has Intel HD graphics 520 it has a two
and a half inch SSD or hard drive tray
which is configurable as you would like
it can support up to two sticks of ddr3
else up to sixteen gigabytes of memory
on the front of the unit it features a
power button two USB 3.1 type-c
connectors a USB 3.0 slash SD card slot
which is actually pretty cool and then
headphone and microphone jacks the tops
and sides both feature a really cool
honeycomb mesh aesthetic the bottom just
has some feet to raise it up off the
ground and keep it away from sliding on
your desk next time think about the
zotac is ZBOX EI 740 which is the more
entry-level zi box that we're gonna be
checking out today
it features an Intel Core i3 6100 T
skylake processor and then AMD Radeon r9
M 365 X with 2 gigabytes of gddr5 I'm
under the impression that this is
somewhere around the desktop rated
performance of a 750 Ti if you're
wondering this one features 2 ddr3l
sodium slots a two and a half inch slot
for a hard drive or SSD configurable as
you please and an m2 SSD slot as well
this one's aesthetic isn't quite as
awesome as the previous one but still is
pretty good being mostly matte I do like
that on the left hand side we have a
large circular power button then we have
a USB 3.0 slash SD card slot on the more
right-hand side with a headphone and
microphone
jack in 3.5 million meter after that and
then USB 3.0 type-c connector on the far
right hand side just note when we're
looking at the back here there's
actually three full-size display ports
not six that you're able to see those
six are for a digital signage version of
this computer not an actual consumer
available version there's a Wi-Fi
antenna which also supports Bluetooth
4.0 dual gigabit ports and dual USB 3.0
ports with an AC jack on the back ZOTAC
also announced a 480 gigabyte nvme drive
at CES 2016 this year it's something we
going under a fair amount of revisions
both aesthetic and firmware wise in
terms of speeds so I have them up on
Twitter if you have any feedback it will
currently be probably running at a
sequential speed of in terms of read and
write 2500 megabytes per second and 1200
megabytes per second respectively so it
should be pretty beast mode I currently
really like the aesthetic of the kind of
hole based design on the gunmetal side
that will probably be facing downwards
in most configurations and I think they
might be just making that flat so you
can weigh in message them on Twitter
thank you again to Squarespace for
sending us here to CES 2016 if you guys
need a website because you're super
badass at making ball-based chandeliers
that hang up in really crazy expensive
hotel rooms then you know maybe make a
Squarespace website you can use their
commerce module to sell and distribute
your crazy chandeliers you might even do
that in person how do you distribute a
chandelier genuine question let me know
in the comments down below anyways if
you're confused because you make
chandeliers and not websites you can use
their 24/7 live chat or live email so
live email support their live chat or
email support which are super super
helpful they have tons of different
graphics the pre-done templates that you
can use to make it look really pretty
and you can even maybe make it so that
there's like images that are all of your
different chandelier designs and that
people can pick one specifically or they
can see custom work that you've done for
other people you have a gallery and a
store on the same page anyways
Squarespace build it beautiful I'll see
you guys next time to see all of our CES
