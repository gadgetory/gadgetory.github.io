laptops rocking a fifth generation i7
5700 HQ running at 2.7 gigahertz - a
boost clock of 3.5 gigahertz the panel
for this bad boy is a 15.6 inch wqhd
plus 28 80 by 16 20 IPS panel featuring
Nvidia g-sync which I hope you get rid
of stuttering and tearing and whatnot
which is also powered by dual GTX 960 5
M cards in sli if that wasn't enough for
you for storage they have three
potential MDOT two slots and a 2.5 inch
slot for potential raid of three
different drives in em - and another
giant storage drive in your
two-and-a-half inch slot but one of
those named two slots might be taken up
by an Avery media hardware encoder if
you're one of those guys that want to be
able to stream on that go which is
pretty freakin sick with the stock
configuration of eight gigs of ram but
expandable up to 32 gigs of ram you also
have killer networking with a gigabit
port on the back of the computer 802 dot
eleven AC for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
version 4.0 for what you're mainly going
to put your hands on you have a glass
touchpad which feels really nice on your
fingers and a backlit keyboard with a
whole bunch of macro keys and profiles
on the left hand side then we come to
i/o we'll start on the left hand side
with mini DisplayPort HDMI headphone and
microphone jacks USB 3.0 port and a
Kensington lock then on the right hand
side you have two USB 3.0 ports an SD
card reader and a surround port HDMI
jack on the back we have that previously
mentioned Ethernet jack USB 3.0 VGA and
power just above the monitor you have
fairly standard fare of an HD camera and
an internal microphone for speakers you
have to 1.5 watt speakers on each side
of the kind of base of the laptop and
you have a subwoofer just above the
keyboard in the middle ish area and last
but not least is cooling you have four
heat pipes for the CPU and four heat
pipes for the GPU all cooled by two fans
the intakes for that are on the bottom
and on kind of the upper part of the
size of the laptop and those will
exhaust
