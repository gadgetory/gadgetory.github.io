series of unbilled or tear downs or
whatever we call these live streams
where I put stuff together and take
stuff apart this time I was inspired to
do one by a particularly unique little
machine this is the zotac Magnus en 980
it is actually smaller than the MSI
vortex that cylindrical PC that I took
apart in the past although it only has a
single GTX 980 inside of it instead of
two but what's interesting about this
guy is they managed to cram a full 120
millimeter liquid cooling system inside
of it so I want to tear it apart and see
just how it all ticks
the Phoenix Vitesse features a
lightweight design and an optical 3310
sensor check it out and enter for a
chance to win down below so let's get to
it then first things first let's run
through the overall specs of this puppy
it's got a Core i5 6400 and 16 gigs of
ram I think actually configured it with
32 it's got a GTX 980 it has an m2 slot
a SATA slot and it has no power supply
yes my friends one of the unique things
about this particular system is that
while they did manage to pull off an
impressively tiny form factor here in
terms of the PC itself they went and
they did something that I've been saying
more manufacturers should do for quite
some time I've talked to Coolermaster
about this I've talked to silverstone
about this they went and they took the
power external so this is - what are
these I think they're like about a
hundred and eighty watt power bricks
giving this puppy a total of about three
hundred and sixty watts of total power
delivery which might explain actually
why the CPU is a core i5 rather than a
core i7 you know 6700 K or something
along those lines because I think they
might have run up against a power limit
otherwise because that 980 graphics card
is going to really suck up some juice
unfortunately this isn't something that
I was able to evaluate in my review of
the thing because ZOTAC basically went
well not user serviceable and once it's
apart it's not that easy to put back
together so we would recommend you
review it as a completed unit I kind of
went okay that's fine but you're not
going to prevent me from taking it apart
at some point so without further ado
here we go the bottom is pretty simple
all you do is undo the four thumb screws
there pop it off and OOP alright let's
go ahead and get rid of that one thing I
do need is one of my trusty magnetic
parts trays that will help me keep track
of all the screws and bits and boobles
there we are ah the RAM and the SSD that
you see in here this is
that I installed so I've got a couple of
those freaking fantastic intelligent
memory sodium's that I'm so fond of
these are ddr3l so that's one of the
reasons that skylake has support for
both ddr3l and ddr4 is that it gives the
manufacturers a little bit more
flexibility to offer a lower cost
solution to folks who don't want to
invest in ddr4 was more of an issue
right at the beginning but I have a
feeling this product has been in
development for quite some time given
that it's running a gtx 980 when the gtx
1080 is most definitely already a thing
and if you're trying to set that up that
is straight-up not going to work because
i'm streaming from that computer I
really like what a good job they've done
of the bare-bones nests of this I am
going to use a tool because I tightened
this with a tool so it's actually a
little bit tight right now but you can
do the entire memory SSD installation
with no tools whatsoever out of the box
because those bottom feeder thumb screws
I thought that was really clever one
thing we've got a pretty good look at
here I'm going to go ahead and switch to
my now not broken close-up here you can
get a good look at it's kind of an
awkward angle unfortunately it's going
to be hard for me to adjust but
basically there's your two and a half
inch SATA there's your MDOT two and so
you can see they've got little standoffs
here to accommodate a variety of
different lengths here and then over
here is where you've got your two DIMM
slots and other than that you're
basically not intended to touch this
although what's interesting is for some
reason they went and covered up the
wireless module I'm not sure why that is
but it's right back there and then the
other thing that we can see here is a
CPU backplate right there so we're going
to have we're going to have a better
look at that
once we've been able to take it apart a
little bit more so step number two is
going to be to remove a metric whack ton
of screws all around I say step number
two as though I have some kind of like
pre planned out step-by-step guide that
I'm following along nope I will be
making this up entirely as I go along
I have had some of the the front and
back panel I have had off already but I
have not removed the side panels yet so
you guys will be experiencing that with
me for the very first time overall
industrial design of this thing not not
you know particularly next-generation or
anything like that you know it feels
like like quality but not like wow we
did a massive amount of R&amp;amp;D to figure
out how to assemble this thing like this
because it's just basically an aluminum
box but it's nice thick anodized
aluminum that's got a pretty durable
finish on it so I'm not going to
criticize ZOTAC for it it just doesn't
stand out as like like an amazing feat
of art in addition to just being a
functional and sturdy you know computer
covering so this gives us a pretty good
look at the front panel here so
basically there is a little power PCB
that plugs into four wires so that's
going to be basically your front switch
as well as your front power LED since
the LED is actually built into the
switch here everything else is just an
aluminum cutout and then this is kind of
interesting so this is a solid aluminum
piece and then this this black part here
is like a plastic insert that appears to
be just kind of glued on to give it a
give it an accented look at the front if
I was going to have one of these in my
living room I'd probably want to paint
it like do some kind of a more
performance looki finish to it because
honestly that's one of the things that I
think is really missing from this it is
a $1600 u.s. bare-bones machine and then
it's got like this weird thank you guys
a closer look at it it's got like this
weird powder blue color mesh on the top
and then it's otherwise white and silver
and black it doesn't have like a like a
high-performance vibe like I get trying
not to do the overdone gay Marie oh it's
red and black and those are the only
colors that exist for some reason
because asus rog said so like i get that
but I don't know that powder-blue would
have been the route I would have gone
especially when your ZOTAC and you
already have kind of a black and orange
color scheme that I personally think
looks pretty good
so I've taken out all the screws around
the outside let's go ahead and pop off
the rear panel that's one that I've
already had off before so again it's
like a nice thick very rigid piece of
aluminum here not really a whole lot to
say about that so let's go ahead and put
it down there we go
then let's have a look at our side
panels here let's see if we can oh
there's more screws well that explains
why I couldn't get it off before okay
the top completely fell away when I went
and tried to remove that piece it's very
shiny mass drop is currently hosting a
drop for the amazing chocolatier custom
si key cap set which is designed by Sam
boom on and inspired by the motion
picture adaptation of Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory the key caps are n X
stem compatible and made in the USA if
you guys don't know about mash drop they
have a site that facilitates group buys
and the more people that buy something
or commit to buying something the lower
the price will go even if the product
you're buying is a chocolate key cap set
you can check this and other drops at
the link in video description down below
one of ZOTAC biggest boasts about this
machine is how small it is and
justifiably so it's however many leaders
pretty few leaders let's go ahead and
take this off as well
but they go when they do things like
cover the entire outside in actually a
surprisingly thick outer shell when it
the actual hardware inside is
considerably smaller I'll give you guys
a better look at that sort of baby blue
color that I am NOT that fond of you
can't see it on camera through here very
well for some reason but it's quite
visible in person it looks about like
that very very strange choice and I will
also give you guys a better look at the
machine itself all right so that's the
top so that's a full one
hundred and twenty millimeter radiator
that they managed to put in there and
not only that but while it's not a super
thick one or anything it's also by no
means the slimmest one that I've ever
seen it's like at like a standard
full-size PC radiator that they've
managed to cram into this tiny little
space here on the bottom
it still looks largely the same on this
side we actually get our first look at
the custom GPU block so that's an NX M
form factor gtx 980 the same kind that
you would see used in those gtx 980
laptops devices like the msi vortex all
that kind of stuff and then over here ya
see this panel is solid for some reason
not quite sure why but the cpu block
would be behind there there's a
vibration dampening mount for the pump
right here i guess that's why this is I
guess that's why this is one solid piece
because that's where they did all the
mounts for there and then if we look at
this side we get a pretty good look at
front i/o which is on a little daughter
board as well as the fan for the
radiator and you can kind of see the CPU
block but this our rear shot gives us a
bit of a better angle on it so there's a
CPU block there's the dual DC power ends
there's the I believe this is for the
graphics card oh I see yeah so there's
the PCIe eight pin for the graphics card
and then here's all of our all of our I
oh and that stuff so what's interesting
about external power supplies to me is
that the conversion from DC to DC is a
lot more efficient than the conversion
from AC to DC so what that means is even
though unless you had like a very
complex power brick you can only feed
one voltage in so in the case of these
ones it's probably nineteen and a half
would be my guess yeah nineteen and a
half volts converting that to 12 volt 5
volt 3.3 volt all the different voltages
that you need for a computer doesn't
generate a ton of heat and so can and
can be done very very efficiently so and
it doesn't take up a lot of space so
remember those Pico psus
actually not remember I'm sure they're
probably still around but Pico PSU is
basically take an external power brick
and they do all that splitting out and
it sound like it's on a PCB that's
probably about like this size like it's
very very small so that's effectively
what they're doing is they've created a
completely custom motherboard here that
includes all of the power conversion
circuitry that's needed to take that 19
and a half volts and turned it into what
all of the other components inside need
so this bottom plate here just pops
right off just a couple screws there
it's actually really easy to disassemble
compared to the MSI vortex even though
the size is very similar I guess because
they went with a more traditional square
shape so the only thing that that really
reveals is a better look at the CPU
backplate here as well as a look at our
wireless card so that could quite easily
be swapped out if we really wanted to
let's just go ahead and switch to our
close up here so that could be swapped
out quite easily as an end user if we
wanted to but it should be noted I think
actually no I don't think we have broken
any warranty void if removed seals yet
so you're in good shape as long as you
don't start taking out the motherboard
it looks like that's where you start to
get into trouble that's okay we'll be
voiding that warranty before this video
is over top the wireless card off 3165
ngw in case anyone on earth okay so
there's some debate about the GTX 980
card that is inside the system we've got
some people saying that it performs on
par with a 980 M do - it's probably due
to its MXM form factor and then we've
got others among you saying that it does
not it actually performs the same as a
desktop 980 which is the correct answer
it performs identically to a desktop gtx
980 it's just mounted on a much more
compact PCB and it requires there's
probably some binning involved in making
sure that it'll operate within the
thermal and power limits but no it
performs exactly the same as long as it
doesn't thermal throttle so wow there
you have it that's actually a whole
thing just kind of comes out like that
so there's the other main piece of the
chassis let's go ahead switch
to our close-up camera here let's see if
I can get you guys a bit of a better
look at this so there's our anti
vibration 'el pad on the bottom of
another black aluminum plate here there
we go that's a bit of a better angle for
you guys mounted on that this I thought
was just such a weird weird
implementation of this system so yeah
that is so just so bizarre so the pump
is here and then they've actually got a
tube coming out to a completely separate
standalone reservoir and then they've
got another tube coming out to the
radiator the radiator bone is connected
to the GPU bone right over here the GPU
bone is connected to the CPU bone or no
wait yes yep so GPU is connected to CPU
and then CPU comes back to the pump most
of the time with a compact water cooling
system the reservoir gets combined with
some other component either the radiator
or if you want to deal with a so tax
legal team with the CPU block so it's
very strange to me that they went and
they it's like it's such a weird little
part here it's this tiny little
reservoir but I guess for some reason
that was easier for them to do or
cheaper or or something either way I
mean they didn't compromise on the
compactness of the system so I can't
really fault them for it one thing's for
sure though this disassembly is about to
get a little bit more complicated so
let's go ahead and I think I'm just
going to try and remove the water
cooling system as one piece here so we
can get a better look at it because that
will have to come off if I want to swap
out the CPU okay yeah with all these
tubes kind of zip tied and cable managed
together it's actually kind of hard to
get it anything I guess this is what
they were warning me about
it's hard with this overhead shot for
you guys see anything with this radiator
constantly in the way so here are my
options I can either remove one two
three four five screws here I'll point
with something that's a little bit
easier for you guys to follow along with
so I can either remove this one and one
two three four around this fitting here
or I can try and remove one two three
and see if the whole video card will
come off so I'm going to try that what a
cool little machine there it goes
alright let's give you guys a better
angle of this so now
CPU is free GPU seems like I can just
tilt it up Oh along with this whole
assembly and pop it out okay
now being very very careful with that
let's go ahead and switch angles here
the whole thing should basically peel
away let's pop that off pop that off and
whoa okay um sure awesome
so let's have a look at the water
cooling stuff first wow that is a lot of
thermal compound cheese otech like what
the heck is going on here the good news
is it didn't leave a whole lot of goop
on the actual CPU so I can deal with
that relatively easily this is cool
though so they've actually opted to make
the completely their own custom block I
do have to wonder about the wisdom of
using aluminum and copper within the
same block design if Swift tech couldn't
do it I don't know how much faith that I
have Enzo Tech's ability to pull this
off without corrosion given Swift Tech's
vastly superior experience in water
cooling the apogee GT zet GTX I want to
say total total disaster for them but
this is cool by designing their own
block and machining their own block they
were able to have the vrm so the actual
voltage regulation modules on the
motherboard cooled by this block as well
so that's kind of the other component on
a motherboard that's going to run quite
hot and might be a concern in a system
that doesn't have a lot of air flow
something that I actually was a little
bit worried about when I did my review
of this thing which will be up later but
I have filmed it already because pretty
much the only exhaust is at the top here
so the exhaust is all here and then the
only intake that I could find was
actually above the i/o in the back panel
here I mean yes there are intakes in the
very bottom here and the SSD down there
did actually manage to stay pretty cool
but what's interesting about those is
that they basically sit here an hour are
pretty much here if I can give you guys
a better look at this
they are pretty much cut off see they're
covered by the by these plates here like
they're only only a little bit of it is
exposed and even then it's kind of
closed in by the by that by the way that
this shell sits here so
I don't know it was something I was a
little concerned about and I'm really
glad you see that the vrm is being taken
care of by a water block there because
that means that will definitely be okay
alright let's go ahead and pull the GPU
block off here looks like it should be
just four screws this is the first time
that I have ever laid hands on a
water-cooled MXM card there's a first
time for everything right water-cooled
MXN theoretically I could use this block
to jury-rig some kind of like
water-cooled video cards on sense
although there would be no need because
they soos has already kind of been there
and done that
GX 700 or something I think they call it
okay has this unscrewed yet how how long
do you have to turn these for cheese I
can't even tell if they're still coming
out screws in the bottom going into it
alright let's see if I can get you guys
a good look at this as it comes apart
well
okay that's the whole mom no okay there
we go here we go look okay off it comes
there so here here is our MXM gtx 980
there's your power delivery here's the
eight pin power in just like that it
looks like I I don't remember you know
what I haven't looked that closely but I
can't imagine that most notebooks are
using an eight pin PCIe connector like
that so I would imagine that's something
slightly custom that they've done here
remembers Oh Tech is an actual
manufacturer of graphics cards so it
wouldn't be that big of a deal for them
to do something like that
there's the GPU itself and then there is
your either four or eight gigs of ram
depending on your gtx 980 so this one
has four gigs of ram okay and then here
we've got pretty much every part of that
graphics card is cooled by the water
block through the use of thermal pads or
this copper slug in the middle so again
they've gone with mixed metals for their
block design here it's such a rookie
mistake you know like if you guys have
been following along with a Seuss's
rampage series of motherboards over the
years or is it maximus whatever I don't
know the one that's had water cooling
integrated on to the Northbridge for
years and years and years now they went
from what was the first one like like
tiny little barbed fittings and aluminum
to like I think they did mixed metals at
some point they included these weird
adapters to get the barbs to different
sizes and like there's all this like
stupid stuff and it's very simple water
blocks are made of copper and they use G
1/4 threads now in this case I can
forgive not using an industry standard
threading that that's fine because you
don't intend for anyone to actually use
these outside of this one system but
water blocks are made of copper yes it
costs more yes it is more difficult to
machine
the benefit of your system not corroding
and having the block fall apart is a
pretty compelling one alright so let's
go ahead and have a quick look at this
guy from overhead so now that we've got
the video card out there's our mxm slot
there's our DC power in there's where
that 8 pin is going over to the graphics
card over here here is our vrm for the
cpu actually over here as well huh
that's interesting
ok ah there's our chipset so wow that's
a kind of a funny layout so I'll have is
here which means that this is
communicating with this and then pretty
much everything here is going to be
using another layer of the PCB to go all
the way back over here where the USB
ports and at least oh no Ethernet is
probably using yeah that's a there's a
here I'm going to go ahead and switch to
my other angle that I didn't have for a
bit there again I need to see that
that's ok um so we've got where did it
go Ethernet
oh yeah ok so there's a real tech
chipset right there so that should be
handling this ah we've got yeah
basically just USB then I guess running
off of that because the two HDMI ports
and two DisplayPort ports should be
running off of the gtx 980m so i guess
that's why they put that there because
those are much higher bandwidth
connections than really anything else on
the back here which is just a wireless
module which is running off PCI Express
which is over here around on the back
right there and then power in that's it
so I guess that does actually make a
fair amount of sense so right here is
for the CPU fan so that's running the
fan for the radiator as well as oh
there's a ok this is interesting so this
is something Luke actually told me while
I was working on my review of the en 980
there is another version that's very
similar to this that's actually air
fooled and ZOTAC was using as like a vr
backpack thing so that would explain why
there's not one but actually two fan
headers here so one of these is for the
mxm fan and one is for CPU fan so that
would be if they are air cooling this
monster very interesting
this says motor pete motor power so
that's going to be for the pump and then
other than that there's really not a ton
of connectors here this is just for the
front LED and power button and let's go
ahead and I can let you guys have a look
at the back again now that my camera
angle is actually a little bit better
good work Brandon yeah oh well this is
kind of neat why don't we have a one we
have a quick look at this one that's it
oh that's weird
okay okay no no no things are things are
about to get kind of interesting here so
this daughter board right here is
plugging into an N dot two slot for some
reason why would they do it that way so
oh well if you ever had to pull your
CMOS battery on this puppy
you would be basically doing a full
disassembly so that's kind of a pain in
the ass way to go so tech you can think
of a fair number of reasons why doing
that might be convenient Wow so
interesting there's an m dot two slot
here that appears at least on the
surface to just be a normal normal m dot
two slot
yeah it's keyed the same as the one on
the front so it's not a mini PCIe 4x
slot which it could have easily been
depending on what they were doing on
here and then it looks like oh yes
okay so basically they are using it
though as just unlike just a small PCI
Express connection because they've gone
and they've put in as media chipset to
handle the front USB connections so that
would be that USB I believe these are
USB 3.1 but don't quote me on that I'm
just going to go ahead and pull an old
Linus trick
and consult the packaging when I can't
remember something look Baba bah yep so
there you go that's why they did it that
way it's a USB 3.1 controller for mass
media so that those front ports can be
USB 3.1 this drives me crazy though the
industry cannot decide what to do it's
supposed to be as far as I can tell
white or black on the inside for USB 2
blue 4 USB 3.0 is what we used to call
it but now it's called 3.1 Gen 1 so five
gigabit and then it's supposed to be
pale blue or like like this green 4 USB
3.1 as we used to call it or USB 3.1
gen2 10 gigabit and then you got Razer
who's running around putting like green
plastic on all of their USB ports so no
one knows what the heck is going on I
blame Razer for this there let's go with
that the last thing that's really left
here then is to go ahead and pull out
the CPU so it's a completely standard
desktop LGA 1150 socket covered in
thermal goop of course thank you for
that there you go
that gives us a nice look at that and
that is our mountain of thermal paste on
the CPU that I just pulled out see if I
can get you guys a good look at that
so that was actually surprisingly
straightforward so tax claims that this
thing is not user serviceable and very
difficult to reassemble once it's taken
apart okay I haven't actually tried to
reassembly that it could be very very
difficult still but I don't think it is
their claims seem to be pretty much
baseless I think I'll be able to put
this together and maybe I'll like I have
no idea in what context I would do this
in a video but I would really like to
try 6700 K in here and see if it can
handle the extra power that's required
for that I'm very very interested so I
guess that pretty much wraps it up thank
