is be here in the office on a Saturday
agreed I mean taken now Jake and Anthony
they're stoked oh yeah they're super
thrilled yeah they love it but me I wish
I didn't have to be in here on a
Saturday but the problem is we have a
wack ton of stuff to do to fix our
server room and our network and the only
time you can really do this sort of
stuff is when people aren't using it
which means you have to come in on the
weekend so we need to change a bunch of
our
we've got a we've got us a lot to do oh
man oh I even found out something else
we get to do you guys fellas came in for
the site survey and we get to redo all
of this networking so that they can get
access to this to slide it out oh you're
joking right no no I'm not that was bad
design
it's the comb-over
with glassware you can instantly see
your current and past Network activity
detect malware and block badly behaving
apps on your PC or Android device use
offer code Lynas to get 25% off
glassware at the link below
I think step number one is to do what is
quite literally one of the scariest
things that I do around here Oh turn the
servers off turn the servers off well
this is going well already
Oh oh boy so this is our new router
it handles 10-gig it'll be running
pfsense which means that we'll have much
lower level access to handling all of
our networking tasks so if something
goes wrong you don't have to be like
well okay is it a firmware issue we can
go in and be like yeah it's a
configuration issue we can just edit
this file and off we go
the reason we need it though is we're
getting faster internet so it's five gig
to the broader Internet but it's ten gig
to anything at the Vancouver internet
exchange oh so that's like basically
anything that matters some aw ask Google
so our Google backup is going to be
super fast now oh yeah okay bring that
down get this thing fired up it's not
even that heavy I carried this thing up
it's awkward and it's digging into my
knee
not even that okay there hold on I just
had to lift it up a little bit now it's
digging into my thigh muscle ooh tasty I
have been trying to figure out for far
longer than she would not be
embarrassing a good way to hold this
stupid cabinet door open while I'm
sliding servers in and out of it up pain
I mean I'm sure if we ledge them up a
module in there and be perfectly fine so
the problem is that it kind of doesn't
open all the way easily so when you're
trying to slide stuff out it like get
spot here and here so here's my idea I'm
gonna open it up as much as I can then
I'm gonna drill a hole in the side of
this keyboard tray
it's cooler away dang it's then I'm
gonna take the allen key that I always
have to have here anyway so that I can
pull servers out yes oh crap
well now this can't lift up and that's
also in the way here's the thing
Johnny who originally set up all of our
VLANs and all of our routing and all of
that stuff has sort of retired from the
IT consultancy business so we're gonna
be trying to piece together everything
that he did on our ubiquity gear and
then reassemble it on our pfSense box
from super micro here in theory this is
just gonna be a simple one-to-one
instant swapper Unni it's not going to
be Wow thanks Jake what a downer you
still can't find it no it's like I
looked everywhere over there in the
workshop to look through the workshop
did you call Alex and the hangouts ring
it's like heels pretentious hey sorry to
bug you these the like is missing oh
he's calling where would we find that
yes the air fittings trey is completely
and there was two things in there I took
tomorrow oh okay no there were two
things in here that would not help us
somebody put it in a dumb spot so this
is the router right here what took me
literally less than 10 seconds to find
it okay we was sitting on the chair that
you refused to pick the things up off of
last weekend I took the doofus train
going anywhere to the server room what
server do you want first Jake I
literally don't care I'm gonna label
things better than I go put this out so
is it raining
well actually 101 would be good but it's
kind of far away 30 dusty is all heck in
there your mom's already dosed you the
like I mean you know what how does it
feel
smells like that oh I haven't showered
in three months that's quite a thick boy
what do you drop this thing I know that
haven't been shipping is that what you
tell everybody whenever you drop
something like oh it happened in
shipping got it
you betcha okay that's uncool Eve that
there on top yeah oh my god that's so
high the server's Mindy bud
this my friends is the real reason we
switched to solid state storage so you
can drop it and it doesn't break there's
another thing that we're doing today and
there's another reason we're taking all
the servers out Oh people are careless
and accidentally sign Hardware out
particularly to Albion server because
it's the top of that alphabet in our
inventory system so even like you I
think we'll be able to figure out a lot
of it by just looking at it we just look
at how being server than what's checked
out to it it's like this doesn't have a
Zed 270 board in it yeah than 80 700 K
we're gonna look at server really wanted
those Logitech G Pro headset pretty
closely oh you might have been right
there's actually some headphones check
totes Albion server I don't think
they're Wireless but tuned in ear Pro we
got a GTX 980 is there a 1080 in there
yeah I don't think so so and a monitor
this thing even has its own monitor day
oh yeah every single damn time I forget
how the lid comes off of this stupid
server like there's one screw back here
and I could've sworn that was the whole
skadoodle the gosh-darn skadoodle there
but hey wow this is a you think it's
just like what if I break is that a
problem
I mean wow you are I'm just gonna you
know I'm just gonna let you bask in
there how long did it take me to find
the nozzle I I say that you finding the
nozzle is kind of a fluke do you want to
just go clean servers are you gonna help
me no I'm gonna help you because after
there cleans they need they all need to
be audited so I finally got an IP
address meal to access the pfsense box
this cable that we had for the test card
is caravaggio got another cable it's
fine
yeah we're started yeah I got the Z on D
2.3 gigahertz 16 threads eight cores
we've got 32 gigs 32 gigs of ram it's I
think I read somewhere that the
bandwidth mattered or something and I
think those were the slowest capacity
ECC dims we had you
really I don't know dude I say we just
let it keep the RAM fine I like Wham's
so over only what an hour and a half in
I actually don't know if we're gonna
have all this done by Monday I am
finished auditing one server and Anthony
is copying config files oh come on do I
even care should I put the the drive
covers over the top does it matter
I just don't know if it matters Jake do
these matter they're probably good for
like vibration or something oh they see
they that's exactly what they're for
yeah oh god oh we blew each other Oh No
that's unfortunate at least one of these
bays has an SSD in it but I don't see
any so far no no no no no no I need I
don't even know the best way to do this
so signed out to this server are at
least one to seven SSDs that are not in
it all so I really hope it didn't matter
that I changed the order of these
probably not hopefully oh I really hope
not how many combinations of 24 items
are there seems like kind of a lot it's
probably fine wait what am i doing why
am i putting them back in I have to scan
them oh okay
oh they're jammed uh Anthony can I
borrow your VGA cable and peripherals
and stuff yeah
dang it Anthony who screws in VGA its
proper procedure to screw in VGA yeah
but like it's just a test bench okay I
love that servers don't sound like
they're booting up they sound like
they're taking off yeah it sounded like
you turn on a vacuum cleaner
though this is bad
this has been taking far too long to
boot there was also that weird error
with the LSI controller at the beginning
or a vago or whoever owns that now so
all I can really do right now is like
replug it and hope for the best here
this is really not a good scene oh oh
that's good wait yes oh yes he's that
all there oh that's all the drive so
good
holy crap I don't know how that happened
or how it got fixed which is the very
worst kind of fixed let's go ahead and
shut this bad boy back down and go throw
it in the pile of audited and all good
whoo yeah
winning is taking a lot longer than we
thought this why is this one so dirty
gross 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ah I
thought teamwork right I heard it makes
the dream work yeah yeah that's what I
heard DreamWorks that's what I heard
through the trade market we can say that
I don't think we can say that so we
still have as you may or may not have
noticed a PCI Express 16 X lot you want
to put a 40 gig Oh what are they hundred
giggles stupid haha
are they forty or hundred nine hundred
technically 100 that seems like a lot I
don't think our switch does hundred
though did it work with the Ethernet
devices did you connect to an Ethernet
device over there yeah sure we actually
had like six of those 40 gigabit ports
on the on the switch though yeah on the
down-low what ah I don't know how this
ended up in the baggie for it but it's
not the right size what did it come with
a low profile bracket I don't know well
give me to zip-tie light Oh
people are gonna hate us I dropped the
bottle over here probably wouldn't come
okay I think this is the one that can
technically do 40 gigabit but also can't
Oh
take those line up oh they probably do
they're both Mellanox probably yeah so
we're just gonna take the stock bracket
and then we're just gonna cut out the
parts we don't need and zip tie the card
to the other parts that we do still need
it's a good plan we should throw that at
Dennis and tell him it's a bug how's
this going Anthony I think it's about
ready to go
seriously basically I just need to
change the interface over so that it
uses a VLAN okay but once I change that
over to the office land we should just
be able to drop it in and it should
basically good work should or will well
you set up all the DHCP servers yes so
this is another change we're making
we're putting the DHCP server back on
our router we're taking it off that VM
that was running on one of the Windows
servers which I think we already did
that was did we turn that off already I
did a long time ago everyone on internet
broke the internet was broken for like a
week
turns out our routers date was set to
2016 that was a good year though this is
clover server and this was built long
enough ago that eight terabyte drives
were like pretty dese you say that like
eight terabyte drives aren't pretty D
still you're gonna wish you never even
thought of dust could you get this out
of the way here
oh whoa there's a lot of hard drives on
there this whole bottom shelf is full of
hard why did we use this branch well
because the lower ones
yeah you like that no don't spin the fan
line this guy's just a little it's fine
yeah we should just do whole server room
water cool hey actually that's the
proper stuff to do okay looking good all
right why don't you roll the server for
a change okay but if I drop all the hard
drives it's not my fault did you fart
again I think you're lactose intolerant
oh yeah I am oh holy crap like I put the
compressor in the middle so now we can
walk for everyone to the yeah now you
don't hear nothing so for the
uninitiated this is our water-cooled
video export machine I won't really call
it a server even though it's in a - you
rack-mountable case because it's very
consumer hardware inside the main issue
with this one is that it's at the very
bottom of the rack whoa
oh yeah the orange round I forgot about
that
these are my old drives from like over
my gaming ring first they were referred
with refurb force 120s that i bought
like seven or eight years ago
well that's yeah that's a lot better
than I expected given that oh you know
why I forgot this case is filtered
probably need to clean the inside so all
that's left now is we're just gonna blow
out petabyte projects in the server room
we'll have that fan on and we're just
gonna blow the dust out into the
warehouse and good luck everybody else
rip Anthony whoa watch out there buddy
well bud we're getting care watch your
toes there bud are you ready for the
full couch
we got a X 540 T - yeah me five twenty
six twenty before that sounds about
right new X 400 128 K SSDs XL 60 days
does that say triple redundant it does
whoo baby a triple and then Delta one
should have 60 drives oh I don't want to
count Jake do you want to grab your
screwdriver and then let's get this edge
router Pro out of here pfSense actually
has a really cool feature what's it
called Karp failover or something like
that so we're just rolling out one for
now but in the future we can actually
have them both connected and running in
the event that one does experience some
kind of malfunction we can just have it
failover automatically like I think at
most you drop like a handful of packets
it's no big deal
you say that like you don't like
dropping packets right lightest what I
don't know you're talking about you
don't like dropping packets I'm just
trying to get this work done what if we
have to drop packets to do it while
we're dropping a whole lot of packets
right wow this is very poorly installed
I know I hate it so I just take it out
then no because it's hard wired in at
the back why is it I love security
companies but the point is we're gonna
move it we're not gonna move it yet but
soon all right time to go get Big Bertha
Big Bertha that's what your mom calls it
oh hey Linus yeah I got some bad news
what I dropped it
what No shut up you did Wow
so this is our new main switch so it's
got 48 10 gig rj45 ports and then this
is delicious but we've got six more of
these 40 gig cue sfp+ ports or whatever
what's on the bottom that's our edge
router at the bottom that's our edge
router that goes let me take some photos
of everything just so for whatever
reason we have how about we just pull
out everything we don't need
okay so there's our old router and here
this is our first 10 gigs which I
remember how excited I was about this
thing when I first got it you ever
cleaned it oh honey yeah I clean it once
at least so this is done this is done
they're done Anthony how what are what's
her whoa that's my screwdriver chances
look at your butt well given everything
I know about networking yes this is not
going to work it'll never work
what why I'm not the first shut up given
everything I know all the experience
I've ever had with networking gear fine
it's not gonna work let me know when you
want to try it or if you want to just
throw it right in and I'll set the
interfaces and shut it down
all right thanks Anthony I don't want to
take up the entire length of the rack if
we don't have to if we can ear mount it
I'd strongly prefer to do that it
doesn't have your mouth well if we can
find another way you just drop the
switch - and now he's pretending like it
doesn't hurt it hurts yeah I think
you're just a whiny baby yeah that's my
paycheck I can't even I can't even see
what I'm doing just where you can't just
unplug everything yes I can oh oh damn
it what the this there Anthony what
your stupid amplify thing just hit me in
the face are you am I able to pull this
for you just get a new rack do you want
to come in for the additional weekend
that it would take to swap racks okay
let's just pull this out
pay somebody we got the London look in
our server accent why did you plug it in
we need to split those fans around hey
which way are they going they're going
out this way oh crap I remember that now
no we can't flip those fans around was
the whole point
yeah just gentle gentle gentle we don't
have time for just jammed my hand in the
thing okay so Jake you've got all these
although all the wires in the orange man
it's still here okay that's fine we can
leave that I think I've already pulled
it out what well around the other side
round the outside round the outside how
do you look fine yeah I feel fine
everything's good Wow we should really
not run that on the inside of the rail
wait did we just unplug all the cameras
in a minute what the hell yeah we
unplugged all the cameras of course we
did yeah we can put the router here but
I want to move that stupid NVR somewhere
else okay so this is just an Ethernet
cable we can replace this with wait
where the hell was that plugged into on
the other side other side far far side
far side it's gonna sag and look stupid
put the screws in properly I'm gonna put
it on the top of the UPS for now there's
a fan there no I need the top of the
rack for organizing things put it back
there for now so Anthony figured out why
we're not getting an IP Anthony you mean
we figured out well how you figured out
he figured out we were not getting an IP
wouldn't mean you figured I figured out
why I said did you set it I told you why
I asked if we needed a static IP I
didn't hear you okay so let's start
plugging in devices here shall we yeah
okay I need more energy from you like
I'm dying trying to access that router
so I can get the settings off of it so I
can get our internet back up long story
short
VLANs they don't work when you plug it
directly into a computer oh I have a
switch for you well I have a switch here
though I just plugged in oh yeah that's
the switch I was gonna give you
so Linus yeah these are numbered the
same like you know changing these to a
different color cable or what if we just
mark them with a sharpie well just oh
yes
it was actually a really good idea yes
yeah that's right you like that Wow
you suck you know that that's actually
really yours anything I'm actually
genuinely a little bit mad now yeah you
markham yourself no you can't have it
get one oh damn that i hot-glued the
lock on this door no you can't lock it
don't even better back uh-huh I've been
watching luck sword-fighting show you
see how they go for the shin go for the
shin to the face see that's the thing is
the word really what about all these kid
nobody does that on the potty hey you
can't do that on cable thing
the PES I've got a router and zip ties
to know you need a router I need I don't
I don't think you understand there's
definitely two boys is this better
oh my ankle is this minimum focus
distance good enough yeah I
I need zip ties yeah I would really like
for this to not fall down and smoky in
the head
all right yeah we really need him to
drop a third thing on his head
Oh what is there a monitor stand in here
because it's the stand for that monitor
oh my god
well where else would I put it I don't
know like long-term storage for this
thing that's gonna be long-term store so
you went to UBC for science like general
Sciences yeah so you were just burning
money this sounds very unlike you two
does burn money like that clearly I
figured it out at some point yeah you
did
why didn't you go into business because
I didn't listen to my uncle who
hopefully will not watch this video
because I will get the most epic told
you so hey Jake do you remember when you
were mining on the server room and you
were gonna monitor the power usage with
us and you were gonna pay me back yeah
yeah remember how that didn't happen hey
David
epic power cord that's a nice cheap
thick like 12 GS big boy like that Linus
guy what his office just bring in a
power cord or whatever take it out I
know I did that a bunch give him a ton
of thought wait were you never supposed
to unplug that thing
geez I'm just sheared a mountain extra
wiring in here is ludicrous I think that
we're ready to go you think I'm
reasonably sure we're ready to go hasn't
even power done yet do you have the ear
screws or the ear screws here you don't
need them it's fine okay it was a trap
is what screwdrivers what are you
talking about it's like four
screwdrivers just sitting in the bottom
of what like under the dude yeah under
this what the kid can do work I mean he
works real hard at it for like putting
tape on the ground
I really hope it
just kind of lights up and works that
would be super cool gonna be really
unfortunate if it doesn't yeah and
actually don't know what we will do we
will learn command-line switch
configuration what's beeping oh the UPS
is having a hissy fit turning it off no
wait what what is going on no no this is
kind of moment of truth it's in it's all
right here let me unplug you can plug it
back in again what no no no like let's
just find out if it works all right okay
well I already did that so I hope that
didn't break anything
hey I'm plugged into 15 upstairs I think
does that plugged in I don't know you
tell me you're the one who fed me all
the cables from the front supposedly I'm
over yeah oh there's a 15 right there
plug in cool all right
I'm gonna go upstairs and see if we have
internet I was too much impact for my
testicle so here it is the moment of
truth it's not worse FreshBooks is the
