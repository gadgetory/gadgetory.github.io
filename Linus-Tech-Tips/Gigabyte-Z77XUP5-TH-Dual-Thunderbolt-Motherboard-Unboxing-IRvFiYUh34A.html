the gigabyte z77 x up5 th this is one of
the first boards with the all-new ultra
durable 5 which is ultra cool
professional to performance and finally
ultra current high current capability
should be ultra current capability
because check this up they're using an
all-new power delivery system that is
basically as expensive to implement on a
motherboard as like building another
low-cost motherboard and like giving it
to you at the same time as you buy this
month for it is extremely expensive on
gigabyte side but it is unprecedented in
terms of the power delivery that it can
achieve
there's no coil line it runs cooler
which should achieve better overclocking
because having those hot VRMs all you
know up in your cpu socket area is not
helping things stay cooler on more
traditional power delivery systems so
let's go through some of the other stuff
you got support for all the latest until
Core i3 i5 and i7 processors there UEFI
3d 3d BIOS as well as their 3d power
which is all digital power for the CPU
the memory as well as the the uncork
this board supports Thunderbolt so we'll
talk more about that later and it comes
with a 300 megabit per second dual band
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 card because it
is ultra durable in general it has their
2x copper PCB as well as their glass
fabric PCB which offers humidity
protection if you live somewhere very
humid such as in Southeast Asia for
example where you know just general
humidity in the air can eventually cause
problems for some computer components so
here we can see what gigabyte has to say
about their single package design with
their industry-leading 60 amp rated
power stage which is a phenomenal amount
of power to be able to deliver to a CPU
I mean you might even go as far as to
say totally unnecessary but if you want
to get the best overclocks
every little bit helps so traditional
MOSFETs are hot lower RDS on MOSFETs are
cooler and their new power stage MOSFETs
are the coolest so this is all taken
with thermal imaging configuration ok
overclocking stability okay good and
excellent so if you overheat ah yes this
is interesting so if the power delivery
system runs cooler it actually also runs
more efficiently and we're Stavely so
that's that's just a general function
the fact that it can deliver more power
stabili of the fact that it does run
cooler dual UEFI bios means that even if
you have some kind of a failure while
you're flashing the bios you can recover
it quite easily using their utility
you've also got power failure protection
so they build this into the board itself
so that even if there's some kind of a
problem with a short they have fuses
built in that will potentially protect
the parts dual Thunderbolt is built in
the dual 10 gigabit per second
capability so if you want to plug in
like you know a dozen Thunderbolt
devices daisy-chaining all over the
place and have 20 gigabit per second
data to the whole thing then you can go
ahead and do that soundblaster x-fi is
built-in and that pretty much does it
for the box let's open this bad boy up
and I just love gigabytes styling these
days I mean honestly some of their some
of their g1 series stuff doesn't really
do it for me with like guns and whatnot
on it but they're they're out there
they're just they're UD series boards
are just oh they're just like look at
this matte black PCB every possible
feature without overdoing it on the PCB
size so this is a standard ATX
configuration they also have built in
the fall sevens lots of expansion in
spite of all the extra functionality
that's on this particular board let's
start unpacking some of the accessories
here so you guys to have a look at them
great accessory package including that
fabulous gigabyte stickers flexible
black sli bridge the very best time
clean IO shield with color coating on
the appropriate parts a USB cable
probably from something I think it's for
this guy
and we are ready to go through it so
we've also got a user's manual with
driver disk for a variety of things just
download the latest off the gigabyte
website as well as a user's manual for
what is presumably the wireless card
setting up the software and a
multilingual installation guide book
that you probably don't need if you
watch the lioness detector or rather
NCIX tech tips video on how to how to
build your new PC so yeah that's USB
right there so that can plug into any
one of the PCIe 1x slots and here's
something cool about gigabytes
implementation of their Wi-Fi bluetooth
module this is just a Wi-Fi bluetooth
module I've seen a soos do this before
where they include some kind of a module
that fits on the board but they actually
put all the logic on the board itself so
that you can't just take the card as an
extra value add and install it in one of
your other pcs if you want so kudos to
gigabyte for giving users the
flexibility to you know maybe in five
years when they're not using this board
anymore to still have you know a Wi-Fi
Bluetooth module yeah but they can
continue to use also nice finishing
touches black PCB even on the add-in
card so many times I've seen you know
like a gorgeous-looking board like this
and they include like an ugly Brown sli
bridge or they include like little
add-in card that's got like a green or
brown PCB on it nope not gigabyte they
are not about that these days six SATA 3
6 gigabit connects six gigabit per
second cables you've got a front USB 3.0
three and a half inch Bay device so if
your case it doesn't support front USB 3
then you'll have it I think that covers
pretty much all this stuff antennas so
those are the dual antennas for your
dual band Wi-Fi and now let's get along
to the board itself so this thing has
everything there are those premium power
phases that are just baller as heck
because yeah I'm I'm totally I'm totally
down for those there's your CPU sockets
so again you know all the latest
processors if you want to overclock make
sure you get a K series processor
because those are the ones that are
going to allow you to crank up the
voltage crank up the multiplier and
really get the best results so anything
case series this board is probably gonna
be wasted on it your 8 pin power
connectors and it's ideal location and
the top left of the board and you've got
your full support for the usual up to 32
gigs so 4 by 8 gig dual channel memory
your onboard switches are all up here
perfect this is this is perfect so the
three most clear reset and power and
instead of having them down here where
as soon as you load a couple graphics
cards into it you can't really reach
them this is the ideal location for an
open test bench all your voltage check
points are right here so you can use a
multimeter in order to check any one of
these different things including your V
core as well as your interview memory
controller all that good stuff your
memory moving down to along the
right-hand edge you got your 20 4 pin
connector it's ideal location post LED
again this is a much better location
than down here because you can actually
see it whoa check this out you guys
three one two three front panel USB
three headers that is absolutely
outstanding I don't think I've seen that
before auxiliary SATA power connector so
this do not plug this out to a drive
that is not how this works
this is auxiliary power for your PCI
Express slot so you plug SATA power into
this to say two three six gigabit per
second ports for say two to three
gigabit per second parts all on a right
angle in their ideal locations you've
got an additional SATA port so this is a
SATA 3 16 bit per second and that's
probably the same chipset that's power
in the eSATA on the back of the board
PCI Express slot layout is pretty good
actually so you've got on your One X and
throw your Wi-Fi module in there your
dual slot card will then cover that
which will leave you with a 1 X slot
yeah an 8 X electrical slot a PCI slot
just in case you still got something
legacy you want to use as well as a PCIe
4x slot so these are physical 16 but
they're wired for either 16 8 8 or 8 8 4
and this 4 is running off the chipset so
it's a little bit slower not ideal for
SLI or crossfire configuration for all
intents and purposes this is a 2-way SLI
in to a crossfire board although 3-way
crossfire is supportive front panel
connectors are here as well as there's
your high power USB 2 front panel header
your normal USB 2 front panel header
but this one is better for charging
things like iPads or other tablets
trusted platform module front panel
firewire front audio and then here is yo
leave your onboard audio whether you're
on board on audio stuff this this is
cool so this M SATA port actually maybe
that's what that I don't know what
that's doing that probably powers down
one of these SATA ports so yeah port 5
where 5 turns off if you populate this
so you can use this for things like
Smart Response technology or even just
as a regular SSD it's totally up to the
individual end-user so where's our
Thunderbolt chips I mean there you go
right there
so there's your Thunderbolt chipset
close to the Thunderbolt ports as you'd
expect remember guys Thunderbolt won't
work unless you're using the Intel
onboard audio so that means you can
either use lucid virtu MVP which allows
you to use the onboard audio for what
it's good at which is things like video
transcoding and making sure you're using
Thunderbolt and then you can use your
dedicated video to power any kind of 3d
games even if you're running the display
off of the thunderbolt port in terms of
i/o you've got lots of different onboard
display options a VGA DVI HDMI and
remember these Thunderbolt ports can
also terminate to mini DisplayPort so
that's effectively all the major players
for USB 3.0 ports which gives you a
total of 10 10 USB 3.0 ports potentially
can run off this board 2 USB 2.0 ports
which are great for legacy devices like
if you need to use a bootable USB or
something like that it tends to have a
slightly better compatibility same thing
with like keyboards and mice so I'm glad
they're still including those Gigabit
Ethernet as well as optical audio out
and 7.1 audio out the back of the board
is pretty much what you'd expect so you
got a couple of cooling heat sinks here
as well as your backplate and using all
screws all hard mounts for all of the
front components of the board so thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
first look at gigabytes GA z77 x up5 th
this has a few firsts including its dual
thunderbolt ports don't forget to
