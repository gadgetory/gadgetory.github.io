description so here at the LG booth they
are showing off a ton of stuff they've
got the w7 TV which is super super thin
it's their new flagship OLED they've got
a new line of what they're calling nano
cell which sounds on the surface like
it's kind of similar to quantum dot nano
cell TVs that are achieving 1500 nits
peak brightness they've got support in
their entire 2017 lineup for all four HD
are standards that are on the market
right now HDR 10h LG
Dolby and advanced HDR from Technicolor
on the monitor side of things LG a is
showing off a super high pixel density
21 and a half inch 4k display settings
links crazy sharp moving on though to
what was for us really the star of the
show the updated LG gran I really liked
the original Graham I respected LG's
decision to take a concept we're gonna
make the lightest laptop and really go
all-in on it but there were a couple of
compromises that I wasn't the biggest
fan of so number one is battery life
wasn't amazing on the gram well now all
three 13 14 and 15 inches are equipped
with 60 watt hour batteries to go along
with seventh generation KB like Core i5
or Core i7 processors they're all still
running 1080p displays which is the
right move if you're trying to conserve
battery life and you're trying to
conserve weight and hallelujah they've
got backlit keyboards now that makes a
huge difference to me because I'm often
working in a dimly lit room because I
don't care about my eyes apparently the
last one is that the 15-inch has
Thunderbolt 3 if you're into connecting
your super mobile lightweight device to
like an external 12 drive storage array
or whatever the case may be
and as before they all come in under one
kilogram so thanks to you guys for
watching thanks to who do I usually
think right sponsor don't subscribe
that's what I usually say and a shout
out to deep brand for allowing us to be
here deep brand makes fantastic skins
for phones laptops game consoles game
controllers you can use our configurator
to see
exactly what it's going to look like and
hey even if you're not into the whole
marble iPhone or matte black
you know galaxy s7 thing you can still
get some accidental damage protection
going on and for a limited time they're
offering $1 worldwide shipping so check
them out at the link in the video
