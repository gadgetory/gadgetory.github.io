tips livestream with special guest slick
well you were a special guest at one
point at the beginning yeah like a long
long time ago yeah that was that was
like six months ago
no must have been more it was it was
December it was before Linus media group
split out on its own
yeah it was either December or like late
November yeah because that was when my
arm was messed up yeah like you were in
school still oh no I was a long time ago
Wow but you're still special Oh long
setup yeah that was totally worthwhile
so guys welcome to the Linus tech tips
livestream the we're gonna get pretty
much right into it with a Twitter Q&amp;amp;A
blitz
so get your Twitter Q&amp;amp;A in right now
well we just give you uh some special
messaging special messaging from Intel
so guys if you haven't checked it out
Intel gaming Pro Mode comm is where you
can check out their gaming promo right
now so it's a PAX Prime promo if you buy
a Haswell CPU if you know anyone who
bought a Haswell CPU if you're gonna buy
a house well CPU so any fourth
generation processor guys it go sign up
for this promo because you have a chance
to win the ultimate trip to pax prime
which basically amounts to tickets and
spending money and there's a bunch of
T's and C's on their website but yeah if
you know anyone who bought one and
they're willing to give you a copy of
their receipt and they don't care about
going to PAX Prime go do it now do it
now seriously because pax for our
tickets are actually really expensive
right now and really really hard to get
it less like yeah yeah all of that stuff
so PAX Prime not paying for it
yay wow that's early this time
there is no like actual reason to even
do it just bail well I don't think we
actually have any EI news this no that's
that's what I mean so we're just to just
take just take it a shot we also have
some really exciting news about the
after party this week so we didn't
manage to 96 Super Mario World but I
think we kind of give up it's it's some
ghost host somewhere we can't tell it
because the color on the pad doesn't
change or something and but we basically
we base yeah we basically give up so
we're not gonna bother doing that but
what we are gonna do this live stream is
we are going to experiment with our
system for having live callers call in
so we're hoping to get that launched
with a special partner next week so we
can do live calling in which I think is
going to be just really cool we're
basically going to be caught up to radio
at that point in terms of Technology
almost yay this bone every fist bump for
something failed you should be sponsor I
see nothing will stop ripping on you
quite quite so hard yeah cuz we're just
gonna alright let's go to the let's go
to the Twitter volunteer which is what
they call the phone board's when you're
on a radio show which is what we sort of
directly compare yourselves to radio
yeah well we're basically like radio but
with video and I think the things a
little now if we didn't have video then
we wouldn't have these technical
difficulties yeah we should just do a
radio show people been asking for it to
be converted into podcast or one radio
last time there was a request for it to
be podcasted that was the top comment
okay I'm putting you in charge of that
okay huh that was easy podcasts okay I
like seriously heart podcast so I have
no problem with doing that okay and I
know like they don't get the craziest
amount of listeners but I love podcasts
all right guys what technology on
computers do you think is behind the
rest display is not good enough say it
or not fast enough
etc you want to take this one SATA in my
opinion really yeah guys I don't think
it's seta
at all
I think that what's actually to slow if
we're gonna talk storage alone is NaN
flash because right now an SSD can max
out a SATA bus but not when it's doing
anything random yeah yeah we're not even
close yeah the drives are not close the
controllers aren't fast enough the NAND
isn't fast enough NAND is still wait
like storage was so far behind and then
SSD was like I mean you look at how many
orders of magnitude faster a current CPU
is compared to something 10 years ago
and like how much fat even with SSD and
SATA 3 how fast storage is but it's not
even close my angle on this is you're
completely right my angle on this though
is that the drive manufacturers are not
super incentivized to push harder
because when people are looking at
benchmarks they see it get capped out
and then they're like oh so it's a
difficult message yeah and it's hard to
sell yeah so why Bob so why bother
so if so if the cap on sat against
removed I think there'll be more
incentive for the drive manufacturers to
push harder well the one that I still
feel more strongly about then storage
because as you know I'm a storage dork
like you've seen the setup I have in my
system in SSDs awesome which is by the
way fast enough now I I'm still gonna go
with this place because I see no reason
to me the thing that's most offensive
about displays is that we have the
technology for them to be there it's
it's stupid standards like HDMI holding
back everything and for people who are
like oh HDMI is whatever no HDMI is not
anything good HDMI is inferior in every
way other than size I don't use it for
anything other than size it is inferior
in every way to DVI DVI can carry a
digital and an analog signal super handy
when you have to output to something
analog DVI can carry twice the bandwidth
of HDMI DVI has a locking connector DVI
is much more difficult to break it can
handle more insertions HDMI sucks there
I said it and DisplayPort cannot come
soon enough
in terms of completely replacing HDMI
but I still like the fact that DVI can
carry an analog signal and if DVI got
this
kind of TLC that HDMI gets if it was
getting the double bandwidth in HDMI is
getting that finally gets it caught up
to DVI finally if DVI was getting that
we'd be able to do 4k 60 Hertz
nothing compressed no nothing with DVI
no problem so yeah DVI for the win DVI
forever like respect to be me I can't do
a failfish but no we can't because DVI
is amazing um so so display interfaces
are one of the things holding it back
but that's still not an excuse because
we have DisplayPort it is capable of it
if they can build a 1080p screen this
big then they can build a 4k screen
that's four times this big and I don't
care what the yields are because you
look at the bond cost for these phones
that includes processor NAND Ram screen
touchscreen interface chassis everything
if you're gonna tell me you can't build
a 4k monitor that's like 24 inch for
less than you know 500 600 bucks BS so
displays are way behind and it's
offensive because we have the tech or
just refusing to use it because we're
putting everything into phones okay next
one sorry that ended up going pretty
long ok shoutout to Dylan static
shout-out to Stephano who are both
watching for the first time did you sign
any kind of a contract with not to us no
actually I didn't apparently the image
is quite bad I don't think I think it is
a bit blurry because I think we were
sitting forward when we focused I can I
can try and fix it don't me to try and
fix it sure how's that no that's way
worse that's better okay no we didn't
sign anything with not to I think it's
gonna be a long term thing condone of
taking my dad 780 from the build I built
him with a 660 with my 660ti he's in
Newman doesn't game the wrong thing you
did was not necessarily swapping out a
non-gamers graphics card but making a
non gamer buy a $700 graphics card in
the first place that wasn't cool man
unless your plan all along was to do the
swap no that makes it worse cuz he's
pissed because that's terrible yeah
you wouldn't do that to your dad no I
hope your dad's watching I would get my
dad
and at 780 but your dad games my dad
game yeah my dad does boink
yes and my dad would use that the same
thing if that card would be of like oh
well I got my mom with 660ti as well
cable that's but she used it because she
played Skyrim okay she wanted that
computer to play Skyrim okay is there no
there is no major fps and performance
difference between those two things go
do you think in videos limiting sales of
shield by making it occlusive two gtx
cards robbing and including AMD they're
trying to buff their product line yeah
there may be an ecosystem yeah exactly
they're trying to make it so that you
are an Nvidia customer so all the things
that you have that could be from a video
is from a video vadym remember that the
way shield works is via a proprietary
Nvidia technology like it's the same
kind of technology as we're gonna see an
invidious grid where it's it's like
centralizing the processing power of the
GPU and then streaming it elsewhere and
like virtualizing GPUs this is a
proprietary I'm willing to bet there's
Hardware in there for this like I don't
think this is as simple as wide I that's
not what we're doing and technically
they could open it up but that would
probably be a silly move yeah why yeah
why should they I I think shields cool
we didn't talk about this last week
shield drop to $2.99 that's that's
really cool that's actually awesome and
if that rings it go ahead that brings it
into a way way bigger price point
because the second you get under 300
bucks
you're like at 300 bucks like if you
spend half your paycheck and you save
half your paycheck you can afford a
shield with a paycheck is where I think
it gets down to like that's just to be
affordable yeah like that to me is what
the 300 like the $300 thing is like I
could I could wait a paycheck or two and
I could say that paycheck or two yeah
yeah but when you have to start waiting
a month for something then it becomes
tough becomes a program yeah
um honestly an IP I honestly I didn't
really see the complaints about 349 in
terms of the competition that's out
there because when you look at the spec
and you look at the competing devices I
mean how much do you pay for a phone
what's it got on a shield still the
wireless antenna mm-hmm still though
logically the difference between 299 and
349 it's not that much right but
perception perception is huge once you
under that exactly 300 dollar mark if
cable TV DVDs and blu-rays all broadcast
at 60 Hertz is there a real advantage to
120 Hertz TV if you gain with the PC on
your TV then perhaps I'm and if you want
to do the whole 3d thing then yes and if
you want to do that screen sharing thing
where you can play dual player games
each wearing 3d glasses and seeing a
different full full-screen image then
it's really cool as well
other than that no there is a few
different things though um here's a
question do you know the answer to this
why would someone want to be able to
digitally switch their power supply
between one 12 volt rail and to plus 12
volt rail isn't it once you get to
insanely high voltages it's better to be
on multiple rails once you're drawing a
lot of current yeah it can be safer to
have supply rails but honestly if you're
able to switch between them then the
reality of it is your power supply has
multiple ranges and they're just being
like combined yeah so I wouldn't worry
about it too much these days the whole
multi rail Center that was only relevant
for like six months yeah and it was a
wild that was like that was back when an
OC Z power stream was a big deal yeah
this was quite a while ago you're making
me feel old it wasn't that long it okay
was well it was what's a good power for
a two-way SLI gtx 780 what would you buy
two-way SLI you take Sony brand aside
depends on your chip remember hello the
brand what I would you better not one
overclock teething hmm not gonna
overclocked them true why don't I go
with another answer while you think
about that
what's a cheap ultrabook to get those
below 700 bucks that is good that words
good and cheap and notebook rarely go
together so you get whatever ultrabook
is the quality you want and then you pay
however much that costs anything other
than an Asus Zenbook I generally I think
that's sort of where they start in terms
of where I'd call it like a really good
quality Ultrabook however the Acer
Aspire s3 the new one looks outstanding
whatever you do though if you're gonna
buy an ultrabook today get a Haswell
based one because particularly on
notebook as well as a big deal it's
actually awesome lots more graphics
performance and much better power
consumption power consumption there's
huge for me okay power supply probably a
760 I because if you're spending with
that much 760 okay because I'm sure you
could make it in that powering yeah oh
yeah it'll be fine
and if you're spending that much on
graphics cards you're probably spending
that much on all the other parts new
system so I'm not too worried about
fitting a Sun 60i into your budget and
you can buy a sleeping kit and those
sleeping kids are sweet that's a tree
okay and then you don't have to spend
all that time sleeping your power supply
and that goes directly to the power
supply for a sleeping kit because some
sleeping kids are just extensions thanks
go all the way to your power supply so
it'll look awesome
and if you're spending that much on a
computer you probably want to look
awesome so I don't know but there's like
there's a whole bunch of other power
spice that I do like pretty much equally
okay is gigabyte the way to go for
Haswell motherboards we actually haven't
used any of these yet these just arrived
they're not even open they're not even
open well a 450 watt sfx power supply
power a Haswell k series and a 780 ooh
are you overclocking are you yeah if
you're not planning to overclock you're
gonna be readable borderline yeah it'll
be on the line it's like whatever
cooking I wouldn't do put 1 SSD in there
maybe maybe don't have an assistant well
you'll need a storage device but yeah
like I wouldn't plug too many like
peripherals into the USB ports I
wouldn't do that
actually if he's buying not overclocked
maybe yeah but power supplies are so
cheap but it's sfx he wants an sfx power
supply so I think 4:15 the max is that
silverstone one i think do that 550
irnos not 450 gold enter max has a 550
so okay we'll see if you can run
interesting at their booth that was the
highest watch I don't remember what it
was though so it might not be that
specific one best wireless hard drive
good question Voyager air it has good
battery life
Wireless plus has a really really stable
app and the Patriot arrow has good
integration with third-party players I
mean none of them are bad to be
perfectly honest yeah from our
experience with them none of them just
like flake out so oh they just
remembered it was a famous it wasn't
okay yeah it was something different
ah okay I'm glad you made it to Josh
yeah maximum is six formula asked me to
pry some release well the price will
probably
look at a maximum is five formula
probably around there and then thoughts
I think the formula bored out of all the
ROG boards is the one that makes the
most sense because it has that really
high-end audio solution on it that that
makes me feel really good about buying
the board because I'm not just getting
like well more USB 3 ports I'm getting
something that's really tangible and
actually costs money to put on the board
like engineering that audio solution
took time and money and building every
single one of them is expensive are you
guys getting JJ as a guest we don't have
him scheduled by any stretch of the
imagination but he's certainly welcome
to join us
um we've talked about this a fair bit in
the past guys so we're gonna leave that
one for now
uh what do you think about studio grade
speakers do you think it is good for
anyone's setup I'll let you take this
one um depends if you're an audiophile
or not I have what are they called again
those courses because this SP 2500 2500
they're awesome they were realistically
pretty cheap because I got them
recertified at ncx so it was an awesome
deal that was a good deal freaking I
bought one too yeah and he heard you had
to say sorry about it there's there are
awesome speakers but personally I I do
appreciate my audio equipment but I care
about headphones more speakers I got
those because there's a great deal and I
like it that they're loud I can hear
them in a room beside me and they sound
really good but I'm not going for studio
grade speakers yeah I mean honestly
they're probably good yeah I think that
I'm sure yeah
how is Topher compared to cherry also
what's your favorite keyboard go they're
really really really different
topor is I don't like them taupe yeah
they're they're really different they're
really premium high quality very
consistent feeling switches but they're
not really cherries you can't really
compare them directly to any switch
people ask me to do this all the time
um they feel nothing like cherries yeah
at all no at all not even close my
favorite keyboard depending on what
variation of all the prototypes that
they released probably a year the snake
because they're talking about rinsing
releasing it
know what blue switches and I think
you're what brown me I prefer brown
switches but my favorite keyboard is
actually disciple 60 which has black
switches so I broke my own rule yeah
someone says the stream is laggy but
that looks like the only one he looks
like the only one complaining about it
so I don't know what to say is 170
Canadian a steal for a secondhand Dell
1920 by 1200 monitor yeah maybe
depends what kind of condition it's in
if it's like a 24:05 fpw like I have
it's starting to fade the black the
backlights not very even anymore and
like make sure you see it make sure
there's no dead pixels or anything on
any thoughts on the monoprice $58.00
blue switch mech keyboard monoprice is
known for high quality and low price
I've heard it's made kind of like it's a
low-end blue keyboard but it's also a
blue keyboard it's da bugs got MX blues
for 58 bucks what do you want me to yeah
maybe get some posters for the wall yeah
we had that last week and we have
posters we have on order did you place
the order I haven't actually put it in
okay we're ordering a bunch of cool swag
for the office from ThinkGeek so that's
gonna be cool
ah my computer won't post I sent the
mobile for our main we see the same one
repaired still the same issue could be
something else could be RAM could be
power supplies you can swap but if you
have other kids of random friends with
it trying to uh put your RAM in toys it
okay big thing so let's get into our
first topic cuz I think we've done a
pretty pretty good out Twitter Q&amp;amp;A blitz
there haha so here we go let me just
make sure I have this I think that I
have this setup right so we should be
able to yes yes yes I do and I think now
that marks on them I monitor oh oh and I
just did the thing as an arrow shake and
everything went away
alright so Sony and Disney will begin
streaming movies that are still in
theaters in a bold move against piracy
ahem so let's just give you the quick
summary so this is on the verge in a bid
to limit movie piracy in Asia so this is
not happening in North America in the US
theaters will still be getting their
90-day exclusive period Sounion Disney
have begun testing a bold new on-demand
service in South Korea which offers
movies to rent while they are still
playing in theaters so they've done this
before this isn't the first time and
there's been a lot of pushback from the
theaters they real
I'm very heavily like very heavily on
that exclusive period because quite
frankly I don't know about you but if I
had the choice whether to pay $12 for
watching the movie at the theater
actually I mean you can get us sleep is
like 9 bucks but it's just books but
then that's also per person yep
so if I could pay 12 bucks to go watch
in the theater or if I could sit at home
and watch it on my 52 inch TV with my
surround sound set up that like quite
frankly is pretty good um why do i why
am i going to a theater well I'll make
my own popcorn for 39 cents certain
movies I think I would still go see
because certain movies that man still
yeah Batman big action like superhero
movies like superhero movies big action
movies Avengers 2 I can't believe they
got Robert Downey jr. like yes for two
more anyway go ahead stoked Robert
Downey jr. my favorite actor she's
awesome
he's so good who can be Iron Man and
Sherlock Holmes I know it's so awesome
anyways um mind if you play it he does
them kind of the same doesn't matter I
know it's awesome awesome okay so yeah
okay so there's the theater experience
with big action movie stuff like that
where you want the like insane yes you
have pretty good surround sound but when
you want the insane room shaking
surround sound and the big freakin
screen and all that kind of stuff like
that's cool and will still pull people
of theaters a little bit but certain
genres I think will get really hurt by
that right okay and I mean it's like I
think for big blockbuster movies this is
gonna be less of a thing but one of the
examples of when they tighten the window
from 17 weeks to 12 weeks on Alice in
Wonderland in the UK Ireland and Italy
Alice in Wonderland was nearly not
screen by theatres they were just like
nope forget I mean wasn't a good movie
for one thing okay I didn't see it oh it
was terrible it was terrible is like it
was just like Johnny Depp in makeup
which quite frankly is awesome how bad
the rest of the movie had to be so I was
gonna say like why is that bad I know
he's so hot oh dear mm-hmm this one is
oh this one's your topic so next one up
is from Reuters
microphone to bring Xbox and PC games to
Apple and Android phones
I didn't read into this too too
specifically but there was yeah
basically exactly what he already said I
think this is an interesting move
they've done stuff like this before
where they support certain things but
right they say right there Microsoft's
Age of Empires will be available silly
old game yeah but free-to-play they're
not releasing any of their like insane
stuff but they're just opening the
platform's a little bit that's that's it
that's is I mean is that an okay couple
things number one is that an
acknowledgement that Windows Phone 8 is
done or isn't an acknowledgment that
they don't care because they're getting
their licensing fees on Android devices
at this point yeah and at the same time
and at the same time they're uh what is
it they're getting at HTC One Windows
Phone 8 version yeah so I don't think so
because they're still pushing right so
so I think this is just them going okay
this isn't like our biggest title let's
just see what happens just see what
happens let's open the floodgates
because I don't think people are gonna
like switch a platform so they can play
Age of Empires no or maybe there's a few
but like there isn't gonna be a huge
wave of pain if you would choose your
smartphone based on which one can play
Age of Empires then like power to you
power to you that's not an EA fist-bump
know you're hardcore yes that's not an
EA game because it's good but I don't
like I don't think it's gonna that is
not gonna be the tipping point for that
many people buying phones so I don't
think they think it really matters that
much you know it it's funny it almost
seems at this point like like Microsoft
is giving more cares to like Apple
platforms and Google platforms than to
their own Windows platform like it has
been it has been a serious thorn in my
side to this day that halo doesn't get
the same support on PC that it does on
Xbox
I'm sorry Microsoft what made you big
exactly was it Xbox that's so annoying
cuz Xbox Xbox one Halo one
on PC was awesome and we got it like way
later you know we didn't get co-op nope
like uh I still ended up playing Halo
one on my what you can call original
Xbox yeah I know right because it came
out so much earlier I didn't even hear
about the PC release how I figured out
about the PC release was I saw it like
when my friends had it I was like what
well I was there not tons of news around
this I don't know I mean my whole thing
is is like one man boycotting if I don't
like something I won't buy it so I
wouldn't touch halo for Xbox because it
was so offensive to me that it was not
available for PC second it came out for
PC I bought it second halo 2 came out
for PC I bought it not gonna buy it for
Xbox I'm not gonna do it same thing my
local cable provider the reason I don't
have a cable TV per subscription is that
they don't support cable card and I
think it's BS that the Canadian telcos
will not support cable card well ok
telecommunicator not really tell well
they're kind of all telcos at this point
yeah I don't know whatever anyway the
content providers up here will not
support cable Carden every time they
call me they call me like once every two
months at least
hey we noticed you have internet with us
do you want our cable TV no please put a
note on my file don't call me again
until you have cable card because I
refuse to pay for things where they're
gonna have uh nante consumer policies
that just limit the way I can use my
devices and are offensive to me as a
customer so there well when I was on my
student plan with Shaw they called me to
be like hey do you want like cable
service so I was like can you give me a
free TV they're like what I was like I
don't run the TV if you won't make your
cable service I need a TV it was like uh
did they stop calling you yep
you should been like well will tell us
gives you a free computer with your
internet sighs like you guys should give
me a free TV success to me if I want to
use your service I have to have a device
user service on I was just trying to get
a free TV I was just gonna cancel the
plan raft
there's a student plans and it cost
anything terrible yeah that's terrible
all right for the minimum no we're not
talking about this um next one is an
article from The Guardian which I'm
having a little bit of trouble with my
top screen here I want this to grow grow
really okay fine whatever BlackBerry
shares fall sharply after smartphone
maker posts shock loss traders slash 1.2
billion from the company's valuation did
they have 1.2 billion left in their
valuation I think they still have 3.1
billion dollars of cushion okay after
revealing a 169 million dollar loss
following poor sales of the news at 10
and Q 10 phones here's what I want to
know what's this loss shocking that's
what I found so confusing was because
they estimated three million units sold
and I was like why did you ask me three
I think it's three million units oh no
this is exactly this is the problem with
forecasting like when I started Linus
Media Group my uncle's like we'll do you
have a business plan and a forecast I'm
like no I know approximately how much
revenue we can make if we do all these
things right and I know our viewers are
gonna support us and I know all these
things and we're gonna kind of go for it
it's gonna be an adventure I don't know
how much of this I'm really supposed to
go into but when we're at Omni you were
like so what are your numbers and he had
a few and stuff but he's like yeah but
I'm kick-starting it so we're gonna see
what happens these are all my papers
like it doesn't and the guy comes from a
financial background yeah
like so you understand he understands
what a forecast is which should give you
some idea why he thought it was just
pointless to have like like he had some
idea you kind of put feelers out there
and you're like okay well you know are
people gonna support me and this is how
well semi similar products there's no
Sun there's nothing that similar to his
but like semi similar VR stuff looking
at pre-orders for rift yeah kind of
going okay well if I get this percentage
this if this number of people who want a
rift also on an omni
okay then it kind of works oh yeah so
don't forget it's thinking about it but
like but at the end of the day like it's
like oh you know analysts need to see
you know a forecast and when your Intel
and your business is predominantly run
rate like Intel CPUs they can they could
manufacture them a year out and they'd
have a pretty good idea of how many
they're gonna need because it's just
once the numbers get big enough there's
kind of there's some variation but
there's like there's a flow to it it
evens out I remember showing you this
when I was still working at NCIX
and I'm like yeah I can predict how many
CPUs are gonna sell to within like ten
plus or minus 10 on your given week and
you're like no I'm like yeah it's like
if I drop the price this much it'll be
this many plus or minus ten boom there's
a long weekend so it's gonna be this
many plus or minus ten it just I don't
get it like your logic and I bet the
logic of many of you out there is if
there's like a product launch
then everyone buys it and then like
sales go like this and then they like go
like this for the rest of the product
not at all apparently not 8800 GTX had a
boost and it sold like this and it was
flat
it sold exactly the same throughout
pretty much its entire lifetime
sometimes growing for seasonality and
that card was current for over a year
yeah that card is freaking awesome over
a year it was just solid and it's like
why and the answer is look at the steam
hardware survey the the number of people
who actually upgrade every generation
it's like super small if Nvidia didn't
release our graphics card for three
years there'd still be plenty of people
to buy graphics cards lots lots of
people to buy graphics cards the fact
that they move so fast is kind of
baffling to me they don't have to
evening and video are just keeping each
other you know check yeah it's like
they're trying to make sure that when
you do go to the store that they have
the fastest one yes even though they
don't really need don't really need to
but I appreciate that they have the
fastest one that they're try so so
anyway so blackberry I mean you know
what maybe this is a good opportunity to
talk about your experience with the z10
you spent some over a month with it you
I will talk with that one quick second I
want to jump back to the article on a
new big guy that's a part of blackberry
stuff it has been talking and saying
okay guys first in Highness I think
that's it don't remember some dude he's
probably some dude from blackberry
that's really really high up basically
it's going like okay give us a little
bit because like honestly they didn't do
that bad if you have realistic
expectations of what they're supposed to
mean the R&amp;amp;D involved in two new
flagship smartphones yes like not
trivial and they have to hit a market
that they weren't hitting for a while
yeah and like they're trying to get into
new markets they're trying to do all
this new stuff like there needs to be
some growing time like people were like
okay you really see a new smartphone oh
you're not doing that well kill you well
it's because everyone's used to Apple
and Samsung results yeah exactly
but then again HTC I think has
demonstrated that someone who's
basically down for the count
can have a blockbuster smartphone yes
and maybe Blackberry should have done an
Android OS release but they didn't what
if that would have been terrible message
though yes and no what if they did a
blackberry version of Android OS they
could have they're switching between
business and normal mode
would you buy a z10 if it was an Android
phone or like buttons no okay if they
had buttons I don't like the screen how
do you see how do you differentiate an
Android phone because rather than spend
a bloody fortune on something that's
basically unmanufactured by almost
anyone else the back of the z10 was very
nice like most of the things about it
was nice I didn't like the back I didn't
like the screen taken because it was
like in pan was it clean you remember
that oh yeah right it didn't have a very
good it's like grease resistant it was
weird I never had a touch screen like
that before in my entire life and I mean
what was your take is okay having tried
to switch to blackberry would you could
you possibly have switched from Android
to blackberry knowing everything you
know now personally I would not want to
yeah like I say is the conclusion video
yet it went out last night okay like I
thought the annotations again yeah
haha so many comments on the previous
wonder like you're doing this and
there's nothing to click on Oh
anyways I would not do it personally I
would suggest that certain people do do
it specifically one of my friend's dad's
who's very business and has to keep up
on things like emails and text messages
and all that kind of stuff very quickly
it's good for that because he doesn't
actually want to spend that much time on
his phone doesn't play game doesn't play
games doesn't do all that kind of stuff
but needs to be able to answer emails
and everything quickly and then put his
phone back away but Android is so
customizable that you can probably come
up with some solution that's so really
good but that's built in and ready to go
immediately that's true you don't have
to fight with it and I think if there's
any no it's ok I can get it cuz I think
you're the next one as well white house
petition something's cheering Center so
cover that one but I think the thing
with the thing with blackberry is that
it's ready done and not everyone's a
homework right ok sorry guys
yeah so basically for the right user the
person that doesn't want to sit down and
constantly be customizing their phone
awesome for the right user someone who
wants to be able to do their social
media and interactions very very quickly
they just said very very oh man um for
someone who wants to do it extremely
quickly it's it's great but for me I
want to do more with my phone and it
tries to be an Android phone with its
sideloading apps which is cool if you're
someone who already has one or bought it
for a specific reason but then wants
additional functionality but for me I
would just want to buy an Android phone
because it just makes more sense to me
so moving on I'm gonna try and figure
out how I'm supposed to do this on my
this is laptop
give me one quick second okay I'm gonna
have troubles getting to it but I can
start talking about it before I get to
it basically different states are not
allowing car manufacturers to sell
directly to individual personal clients
so they want you to go to like
they want you to tell me what they're
called carpark they're not called a
carpark Wow I don't know what they're
called anyways where they sell cars then
when you go there and buy it in person
instead of getting it directly from the
manufacturer so Tesla only does their
business that way so because there are
certain states not allowing it anymore
someone has created a I think his name
is Tim and he's not old and he's not
allowing his last name to be put out but
someone has made a petition to the White
House to make them stop this from
happening because it will essentially
kill Tesla's business it is not a person
from Tesla it is someone who has
investment in Tesla and plans on buying
a Tesla he's a he's a fan of Tesla but
he's not actually an employee of Tesla
Motors come on and it's gonna try and
open this up so right now the petition
has 300 not 336 thousand five hundred
signatures
it needs a hundred thousand signatures
in the article it says that they had
about like 10k or something but since
then it's gonna quite a bit the guys
name here we go article finally open
three this hey it's not opening my press
three it's not opening oh that's kind of
that's the you need seen three okay
sorry about that got our vengeance Pro
memory well that's cool yeah go ahead
I basically finished the article I just
wanted to show people it once I finally
got it on screen oh that's from CNET
scroll there we go here let me get this
ah ooh ooh micro HDMI do do hate got
caught on something there and it's
parked now Oh No Oh micro HDMI that's
bad wouldn't it be funny if that
connector just hardcore bro there we go
Booth's hey micro USB 8 micro HDMI and
it's Pro to buy eight gig there we go
cool we're doing a video about it yeah
we're gonna do a video about it it's
basically it's just got more
overclocking every minute compared to
normal yeah just compared
- does it have any lighting or I don't
know it's just it's just clean looking
over a nice friendly simple memory black
PCB this one right here is in 1866 e9
kit 16 gigs cool ok alright should we do
a Twitter Q&amp;amp;A blitz sure people seem to
like so so guys send in your Twitter
questions and we are going to do one
more article in the meantime so you you
came up with this one but I'm gonna I'm
gonna go ahead and filled it cuz it's an
easy one true him so there's a team from
Vancouver Island which happens to be
very close to Vancouver not an island
which is where we live
specifically from Victoria thank-you
from Victoria which happens to be the
capital of BC although I shouldn't be
because it's on an island which is
stupid so this is n na Matt Kaczynski
and Matt Kaczynski I hope I said that
right she has some kind of an accent
that would indicate that that's an
appropriate last name for her and she
has done something pretty cool so this
is a flashlight it has three LEDs
there's actually a video on the article
this is on Times columnist and so three
LED flashlights that is powered using
only the heat given off by your hand
when you hold it so she demos it at the
very end of the video just skip to the
end because the whole beginning of it so
she was she's one of the 15 finalists
above a list of 90 regional French
analysts from around all over the world
for Google science yeah so so for
Google's global science fair and I just
think it's really cool that she's local
and she explains how she had to do a lot
of analysis and testing for how much
heat per per square centimeter your heat
gives off and then how much heat you can
use what it sounds like she's basically
using the Peltier effect right to it
certain I didn't listen too closely but
it didn't sound like it yeah so heating
one side cooling another side using
ambient air and then generating an
electric current by doing that so she
was able to determine that yes you could
build us a flashlight and she built the
flashlight and all she does is hold it
and the LEDs go on it's not super bright
or anything but but in some type of
disaster kit or a bug-out kit or
something like that where
your batteries might run out and you
might be left dry this is awesome
because if you're using your cell phone
for a flashlight if you're if you're
using a normal flashlight they both have
potential to run out of batteries and
die oh and I think probably the most
notable part of all of this is the fact
that she's 15 yeah so she's already a
hundred times smarter than I'll ever be
which is cool yeah that's awesome good
work we need people like that good work
and yay flashlights real fist bump da da
okay Twitter Q&amp;amp;A boom have you tried out
windows 8.1 preview no I heard the Start
menu still isn't great yeah and I mean
honestly my issues with Windows 8 run a
little deeper than just that anyway so
yeah if I had a sound card in headset
and SP 25 hundreds would you get better
sound by plugging directly to the sound
card or can you use the SP 2500 in good
question if you have a sound card with a
headphone amp plug into it directly if
you don't then it probably doesn't
matter and the SP 2500 zamp can help you
great that's what I do I switch on the
card instead of on it it would be nice
if I could but I don't if you ball a
little bit harder you could have an
awesome sound card and an external heavy
yeah yeah but and I barely use my
computer
it's so nice though that oh I love the
essence one just even plugging like my
in-ear pros into it they do sound better
they do sound better it's just all weird
yeah we're talking about zoner essence
one yeah I love it would you recommend a
razer kraken pro or a SteelSeries
Siberia v2 as far as build quality and
sound quality goes um neither of those
are really at the top of my list as far
as sound quality goes neither of them
are poorly built though if I was looking
for just kind of like your your
run-of-the-mill kind of gaming headset
Siberia v2 is definitely gets a thumbs
up
super lightweight very comfortable and
it has a good mic those to me are the
gaming requirements is if if you're
someone who spends a huge amount of time
on voice chat people will appreciate it
a good mic and I don't have any
personal experience with the Kraken pro
maniac but I have quite a few friends
that have Siberia v2 s because they're
pretty cost-effective and the mics on
them will not give that super annoying
snow effect yeah to the entire chat room
yeah the whole time you're in it
generally speaking if you buy a steel
series headset you're getting a good mic
yeah that's I've never encountered one
of those that doesn't have you seen the
achieve Q I have not yet sorry
ah that's a duplicate guys please avoid
sending messages multiple times if we
see that we're not going to answer your
message this is on here like four times
I hate from the UK how UK 430 watt power
supply enough for this config yeah
should be fine but I don't know if too
many 430 watt power supplies that aren't
total like bollocks so if it's a good
one
then great and there we go thank you
that good I think that's actually
spelled wrong but that's okay ah yo guys
watching the live stream from the UK
hello hi to UK again should we really
say hi to the same country twice yeah if
they're really cool yeah UK is pretty
cool yeah ah oh my gosh we have 4000
live viewers can be right you guys Rock
it must be able to know it's not on
there it's on here
you guys used to be on there that's cool
yeah you guys are awesome that's really
apparently it's like that's why two
people from the UK are are yeah is it
normal for my 690 to not hit a hundred
percent usage on both GPUs you want to
handle this one I've do notice not very
much 100% normal
yeah 100% normal because SLI is only in
very rare circumstances such as
synthetic benchmarks going to be able to
fully utilize both GPUs that is totally
normal
don't worry buddy look at the cores on
your CPU - yeah same thing
yeah ah sing me happy birthday we can't
actually yeah it's yeah it's like a
trademark copyright yeah thing if we do
that I don't even think it's that cheap
no it's not it's really expensive you
know I'll actually go look it up you're
not allowed to sing happy birthday
that's why you've probably never heard
it on TV or in a movie if you do hear it
in movies it's like it's the tangent
it's usually a big thing or they change
it like future Futurama it's like what
day is
day its Lee last birthday yeah it's
something something something so let's
all have some cake like you can't sing
it that's why nobody knows it yeah
I will you be upgrading your rig anytime
soon no no I have a five ninety and a 39
70 X I got eight SSDs and raid zero I
got a lot of lacking their dual rad quad
rad
I have a zone are uhm zone are well I
don't remember what it's called me
morons on ours ents that's the know that
I didn't know we what are you talking
about the data the adven essence one oh
yes yes actually I upgraded my rig today
well they're not here yet but oh I
thought they like I thought you weren't
getting it oh no III left the backorder
in I'm gonna just wait til there's
another one so today I bought myself I
treated myself to two PB 278 Q's oh
that's got to be my favorite monitor
very low input leg beautiful IPS panel
or pls panel rather not sir not
calibrated out of the factory but I have
a calibrator a good one too I have a
good calibrator so I'll be able to get
pretty much performance out of it not
quite and its 27-inch the only thing I
don't like about it is that it's sixteen
by nine and I really did think about
going for PA two four sixes yeah just
because of all the color depth Oh
but anyway I'm going dual dual monitor
which I've never done on my personal
system never done that doing water yeah
it's nice it's really nice especially if
you get um okay I would highly recommend
display vision okay that's that thing I
was talking about where is an episode
about that we should actually okay it's
on Steam now - is it it's on steam
software that's what any computer you go
to you can be like but bam display
fusion okay tell them about it and don't
point at that screen because they can't
see it I don't know enough about it like
if we're gonna do a video about it I'll
research it more but these are the
things that I care about and the reasons
why I got it it can do a lot more than
this but this is specifically why I
wanted it when I went to Windows 8 my
favorite thing was that it would bring
Start menu and taskbar on both your
monitors and you could have independent
backgrounds running on both your mom's
that's cool
yeah display fusion can do that
so that was like the one reason you held
out with Windows 8 for some I had so
many things like weren't working it
couldn't play certain games I had so
many problems which ended up being a
combination of things but it was
including Windows 8 whatever so I went
back to Windows 7 and bought display
fusion that was my that was my thing so
display fusion is great whenever I go to
use anyone else's computer that has dual
monitors I feel like I have a handicap
now because I'm like why can't I
where's my Start menu bar it's so
annoying i display fuse amazing we'll do
a video about it yeah so that's that's
cool so someone asks our SanDisk SSD is
reliable SanDisk is one of the few SSD
manufacturers that actually owns fabs so
like all the other guys who own fabs
micron samsung they are keeping the best
for themselves I would say yes and this
guess estie's are a good way to go ah
you're awesome Thank You Isaac
you're awesome too she probably means
you're awesome too yay good job
he said you're awesome too no I don't
know oh please make a video of the
Gambia's headphones again Dias is gonna
send us stuff once it's ready so gonna
happen cool paint the wall green so you
can make it a green screen and have fun
with it that would actually be kind of
cool xsplit supports it natively
remember the one time that we had my
shirt that was weird I don't know what
caused that because I never changed the
settings oh yeah I don't know I'm saying
that happen the whole wall love the show
says Celine thank you yay
I bought a new keyboard CM storm
quickfire Rapids with cherry onyx black
which switches you prefer for gaming
'brown blue okay do you think unified
memories gonna come to pcs by Broadwell
no no how much will it cost to water
coolest CPU and GPU custom blue probably
a few hundred bucks
yeah a little more if you then TV six
five five get a proper pump yeah pop the
pump yeah no I agree and you can do the
problem is you can code of like any
extent so it depends what you're gonna
do with it you could go with a swift
tack h 220 ad a DP you block that's 240
then you probably still need another rad
which you could probably get for 60
bucks you for barbed fittings that'll be
really cheap see people probably come
with them yeah 300 using using a swift
tech h2o 220 I get a GTX 760 or 7970
between
those two I mean those aren't even in
the same price range man no that's crazy
okay
thoughts on Windows 8.1 I need
transparency I don't know if you're
talking about Aero glass because I need
Aero glass too we're talking about
reviewer transparency um well I haven't
tried 8.1 so I can't be transparent or
opaque yeah
what do you think of Canadian service
providers basically cheating the people
of data my provider is actually pretty
good
um they've never really boned me just
server survivors is he talking but I
asked you your phone could be either I
think neither of my eye I use Shawn I
use Bell and neither of them have ever
really screwed me for ISP we've gone way
over our limit yeah multiple times and I
was just like I'm sure we're doing it
here already yeah so they don't really
seem to care sure at least doesn't seem
to care so that's awesome it depends on
your area
it's just how consumer friendly they are
and out here it's for ISPs it's
basically Shaw and Telus and Telus is so
good that they are bad that they'd make
sure I look good no matter what Shaw did
but Shaw seems to generally try to be
pretty consumer friendly which is nice
just nice phones you get screwed but
everyone gets screwed everywhere with
phones like it's not specifically bad
it's like how would you like to be
screwed yeah it's basically the
conversation you get to have when you go
into the store yeah it's like how
exactly do you want to get to choose
diameter pick and choose positions and
you can choose whatever you want but at
the end of the day your students it's
gonna happen uh Jack Ellis asks two for
a tease in SLI or one 760 and what
happened to your model M so I'll take
the first half sure I'd go 760 way less
heat output way less power consumption
more modern solutions single card is
generally better than dual go part of
how we dried the camera when it got
water damage this exhaust from the 480
that is not part of that is how so like
that should speak enough to that and say
the model M is still it's like it's
pretty much raring to go the problem is
the stabilizers on all the keys that
need stabilizers are broken all of them
so what I need to do is the in general
the keyboards in very good shape so
I want to keep that one and what I want
to find is another model M whose may be
the PCBs broken or the connectors broken
or something that is disabling it from
being able to work entirely and I want
to take the keys off of that and utilize
the stabilizers on my current model M
which would make it fully functional and
in very good shape so that still in
progress but I supposed to be like
blitzes I have a 7970 gigahertz
additional I'm planning to upgrade my
CPU and this year's Black Friday
what CPU would you recommend gaming only
Mercia I'm afraid we're gonna have to
let you know we'd need to know your
current CPU that's really important so
me posted on the Linus tech tips for him
in fact everyone go go post something on
the Linus tech tips forum now because
the Linus tech tips for him is awesome
and everyone should be a member of it we
had actually I want to take a moment
here and be super proud of our forum
real quick there was a conversation on
the the new legislation in the US that
was to do with homosexual marriage and
as we all know this is an extremely
touchy topic it is very polarizing
people get super upset
there was a four-page thread that had a
back-and-forth exchange between some of
our members civil and it did not get out
of hand I was so impressed
we the mod team I love my Martin they're
all amazing but we watched these kind of
threads like hawks because we don't want
them to go out of control but I've seen
a theme lately where we can let a lot of
these style topics just can it go I mean
on any other forum that threads a train
wreck yeah it's a train wreck and
everyone hates each other by the end of
it and generally speaking our policy
when we discussed it is we're not gonna
allow these controversial topics really
to exist on our forum because we don't
want it to become a hate fest yes if
you're having a civil discussion we want
a respectful forum where people yeah you
know leave that out of it go argue about
that somewhere else but let's come here
and let's all cooperate let's talk about
technology yeah but if people can handle
it I mean it's fine
that is so cool yeah like that's just
really cool yeah so yeah we love that we
love that all right moving right along
is two or three monitors set up worth it
for gaming
personally I prefer single monitor for
gaming I have a two monitors
when I'm gaming my second monitor either
is black or has like my voice comp chat
windows on it so if Apple upgraded their
27-inch Thunderbolt displayed a 5k for
the same price would you buy it sure I
would be awesome no idea Gilbert sorry
oh oh what I'm putting in there okay
what's a good power supply 750 is fine
for that tell us let's call the
dealership I'd forget I've forgotten
what the name of the place was were you
ready to go buy cars okay dealerships
grocery stores grocery store no just
places where you buy oh yeah oh okay
kiosk we're improving Slick's vocabulary
one step at a time I mean you'd be
looking for a dealership you'd have to
comb that sound Rick asking people where
their dealership is where's where's that
place where you like go look at cars and
stuff ah Ethan asks if will sign a side
panel if we pay for shipping honestly
dude you don't want to pay for shipping
to us it's a couple hundred bucks don't
do it a good mechanical keyboard for one
hundred and eighty dollars
anything you want the oh man go for it
and seventy nine ninety benchmarks we're
actually you know what here I'm gonna
I'm gonna stop the Twitter blitz cuz I
want to talk about this seventy nine
ninety benchmarks we can't really run
them properly because we don't have a
frame capture setup I'm sorry cuboid I
mean it's on the bench right there yeah
in fact if I if I am this at it you
might be able to see it kind of there it
is
I can't really tell what it is yeah that
is it that's a seventy nine ninety on a
test bench yeah um we can't do it yet
and we need a two thousand dollar
capture card so we've been having some
discussions we're talking about maybe
doing a Kickstarter to help us afford
one we've been trying to find a sponsor
to help us afford one ah it's hard as a
sponsor to justify that I mean we did
have a sponsor step up and provide us
with four SSDs that we could use for
this because you need that type of
storage solution to be
like it's hard to properly test frame
rating on carefully yes because right
now the numbers we get would be kind of
useless yeah
but what we were thinking about doing in
the meantime is benchmarking it and then
doing a double-blind test with him and
then a double-blind test with me to see
if that difference between the reported
fps and the perceived FPS which we can't
measure but we all know exists is
something that we can perceive so we
were gonna do a blind taste test 7990
versus GTX Titan to see which one we
think feels faster or if we can even
tell so I thought that might be a cool
angle we're gonna do like dual seven 80s
yeah so that it's a similar price range
and two cards it's not of course a
combined card but it's still two cards
we still need another 785 so you know
Sony will forego something too Titans
well we have to do it as live we have
another 780 in the mail though yeah okay
so we'll do two seven 80s but like
that's we were thinking of doing that so
that there's no investment because we
can't buy it to the store capture card
yeah say yeah I do Kickstarter something
we are trying to release benchmarks of
this kind of stuff and we want to
release higher end graphics card
benchmarks like higher end as in not the
graphics card but as in the theory that
goes into it yeah I don't want to be
more scientific yeah you know what right
now we're gonna have to blitz some
topics here sure um did you do the ISP
in New Zealand
nope okay let's do that disputed on
there we go so there's an ISP in New
Zealand that is releasing a I think it's
called global mode it's somewhere in
there I think it's called a global mode
which hides your locational and allows
you to access services that our country
bound everyone's seen on YouTube well
not everyone but you'll have seen on
YouTube where it's like you can't watch
this video in your region or anywhere
else really that's really annoying
places like Comedy Central go reason for
the longest time South Park was
streamable in Canada then it got gonna
go next yeah so this will allow you to
view it wherever stuff like Netflix I
know I think Netflix US requires a
United States credit card now or
something possibly something's going on
there but like other services that just
check for your region it's allowing you
to get around it and it's a
the ISP level I know there's other ways
to do this it's not the idea isn't
completely revolutionary but it's very
streamlined which is cool that's pretty
cool so the way that they're marketing
this in him is as a service that allows
visitors to New Zealand to access the
same online services that they would at
home yes wow that's sketches balls I
don't think anyone believed that but
that's very cool I mean speaking of ISPs
that are actually trying to do something
to help their customers as opposed to
just maintain the status quo that's very
cool and out of out of Australia New
Zealand of all places where typically
internet policy-wise they've been in the
dark ages for a while for well since the
dark ages no offense to anyone from
there but I think you guys know better
than us yeah how horrible it is there so
we have 4400 live viewers right now
thats I think I've record so I think you
guys are awesome that's awesome yeah so
let's move into our next topic which is
21 year old receives a twenty five
million dollar funding this is from a
bunch of different corporation it's a
bunch of different groups 25 million
dollars for a payment app they're not
releasing a lot of information about it
but basically his whole thing is that
he's been frustrated having to carry
around a wallet with credit cards and
cash in it and he wants to be able to do
it through your phone this type of thing
has been kind of flopped around for a
really long time I'm interested it's
going to a 21 year old and not something
like Google Wallet or PayPal yeah
because this I think it's called clincal
or clinky or something like that
clincal clincal it's so it's gonna be a
new app there isn't a ton of information
about it yet it's not even out yet it's
not even developed yet fully the
clinical website said it says it is
rebuilding the analog wallet from the
ground up to bring you the future of
payment and dublin Duplin lucas whatever
okay first name Lucas is keeping quiet
about what it actually does so there's
something big coming if all these
there's it names a few players in there
I don't remember who but there's a bunch
of big companies putting big
me behind this okay so Intel former
Facebook CEO Owen Van Natta
and wireless technology company Qualcomm
have all invested their money and faith
in him so like yeah this is gonna be a
big deal like what if you want it to
happen or not this is gonna be a big
deal huh very cool so soon I think we
will have the option to pay with things
with our phone so get this at the same
time like we're at such a crossroads at
the same time we all will be able to pay
with metal you'll be able to pay with
paper you'll be able to pay with plastic
you'll be able to pay with plastic
electronically you'll be able to pay by
writing on a piece of paper that you
commit to pay it I mean come on cheques
still exist really and you'll be able to
pay just by like whipping out your phone
this is very interesting because when I
was in Korea they had this thing called
t-money
I don't have it on me but it's basically
it looks like a credit card or you can
get other forms of it which are don't
you sure it wasn't like a u.s. rapper oh
that's t-paint I know so it's so I was
paying for my stuff and then I got bored
so I pulled out my wallet and then came
a horde of people who were making me not
able to pay so I thought I'd make an app
called crinkle happy day that's actually
pretty good L money L money Oh mom thank
you there you go okay so basically what
it was was you tap it on whatever you
had to pay for you could get certain
stores supported this so what I was
worse than worst freestyle ever come on
it was pretty good I was pretty good
okay you could pay for certain things
for it at stores you could pay for taxis
with it you could pay for any form of
transit and like it's awesome it's very
cool and all you had to do was tap it on
the thing I believe it was through NFC
like so cool and it was so easy it was
so easy to load we're down to 1200 years
they always kick butt yeah something
like so so that exists to already exist
so and I think it's done through NFC
right so if it's that's cool NFC off
your phone it basically already exists
and PayPass already exists which I don't
know what it's branded as there but when
you take
credit card adjusts wirelessly yeah so
we're already pretty much there it's
just moving it onto your phone yeah so
we're heading in that direction very
cool stuff hmm so no we did lose about a
hundred viewers though that's a shame I
guess I shouldn't rap anymore
next topic here we go hmm Connect for PC
and Kinect for Xbox will be different
now I think I'm gonna let you handle
this because I already knew this because
I talked to them when we were at
Computex about it alright go ahead and
talk about this I didn't see anything in
it about this the article that I read
about it was fairly critical yeah well I
would think so yeah
but there could there could be something
with different functionality there could
be something else going on I'm not
really sure but it's not really seen for
a while so Kinect for Xbox one for those
of you who didn't catch the headline
because we didn't say it yet will not
work on PCs now we saw the Kinect SDK
the the kit which included a Kinect for
PC at Computex but it was old Kinect not
Kinect for Xbox I wouldn't use so this
is yet another example of Microsoft
holding back the PC on purpose and why
and it's not really seen for a long time
and the dev kits gonna be 400 bucks like
which is like someone's gonna hack an
Xbox one Kinect before they spend $400
on a dev kit they're already hacking
yeah oh to get the new SDK on it yeah I
don't know I'm er to be able to do
something with it I would think
I think someone will sooner hat Hardware
hack an adapter to be able to plug in
the Xbox one Kinect into a computer or
something or something
oh of course hardware hackers may well
develop their own nuts BAM that's uh
that I'd like that's people are gonna
try cuz that's crazy
yeah I'm I'm I'm I'm pretty frustrated
with Microsoft's general behavior I mean
the kinds of things that something like
Kinect let's just call it connect one
what is sure connect one which is this
second one I connect one like the kinds
of things that would enable on the PC
things like online shopping being able
virtual fitting room for clothing things
way better than the previous one I mean
things like you know I'm even vr gaming
from like a very basic rudimentary
standpoint the Omni uses it to track
your feet yeah Romney uses it I mean
we're not gonna be able to use I mean
and it's a good thing on these working
on there are virtue axes you working on
their own solution for motion tracking
because that is avoid from it now they
can't use Kinect Kinect anymore
apparently they it's that's ridiculous
to me and like and like the stuff people
have hacked what do we even want to call
it now correct Kinect original to be
able to do it is very helpful for a lot
of people yeah a lot of disabled people
have been using original connected
interface of their that's the thing that
Microsoft was demoing at Computex is
what Kinect can be used for in like
medical applications yeah oh but they
don't need HD I guys like what are you
thinking yeah like okay they are gonna
release it that's it's just way in the
future really offensive
so anyway moving right along to our next
topic here
Samsung releases their flawless curved
55 inch TV so let's go ahead and show
you guys this so basically they're
making the same kinds of claims as LG so
that is that a curved display will give
a more natural viewing experience
because your eyes will be an equal
distance from the screen regardless of
which part of the screen you're looking
at um I personally don't find for
something like a 55 inch size at the
distance that I sit from it then it
becomes much of a factor but for
something like a theater obviously it's
a big deal or if I was sitting much
closer to the screen however I mean I
think it's you know it's it's cool and
very interesting to see how that how
that works out for them and then the
other thing about this monitor is they
are claiming that it is quote unquote
flawless so because of the way that
they've designed it the potential for
defective o LED pixels is quote unquote
eliminated so we may be moving towards
and this is real
we may be too moving towards a future
where you don't buy a tier-one display
that has a dead pixel on it yeah I mean
it's awesome that's cool yeah that's
really cool so so there you go it's it's
gonna be priced at 15 million Korean Won
so about thirteen hundred US which is
not that outlandish when you consider
what guys were asking for 4k TVs not
that long ago what did Sony want for
their rent forty grand I think I was
record I could be wrong but it was huge
it was huge it was like way out of my
price to be a year early basically yeah
it's like yeah okay let's go look you
know what let's do razor surround or no
no let's do that at the end why don't
you do the TorrentFreak article okay so
the TorrentFreak article yeah 18 d gets
the patent to monitor and track
file-sharing traffic okay I thought
usually put the other torrent I can
think of I can think of companies that
I'd rather have the patent on that
technology than AT&amp;amp;T and like they
haven't talked about whether or not
they've been using it already because
they just have the patent okay they
haven't been like we are going to deploy
it or we have already deployed it or
whatever they're just signing up for the
pend could be already running okay could
be running in the future it like no one
really knows but yeah whether the
company is already using the system to
track infringing content or has plans to
do so is unknown and if they have been
tracking infringing content they could
all have all that in logs so a lot of
people could be getting in trouble so in
the patent 18t notes that peer-to-peer
traffic amounts for a large percentage
or percentage of traffic generator on
the Internet
some of which results in a loss for
copyright holders for example some
content may be legitimately purchase and
download by users via p2p however some
content may be pirated and illegally
copied and distributed peated p2p
violating copyright laws etc etc 18t
system will be able to detect what is
downloaded on p2p networks suggesting
that this information can be used to
track and counter piracy based on the
verification the list may be modified it
etc the present disclosure may be used
to etcetera etc etc so guys if it is
worth noting it's worth or it's worth
noting rather that 18t participates in
the six strikes copyright alert system
where p2p users are also monitored the
main difference is that under that
program the monitoring is carried out by
the third party company which only
tracks a list of titles supplied by the
MPAA and the RIAA knowing everything now
they can just track everything and they
can do it dynamically so they can
actually generate a list of what is
being pirated rather than relying on
owners to monitor yeah so they can use
this to infringe upon you however they
would like and they can use this to
throttle the crap out of your connection
if they feel like it yeah which is do we
have build bugs of the week I don't see
them in the we do but the powerpoints
not ready the PowerPoint is not ready
yeah because I was doing is we're
leaving into it okay well how do I talk
about Razer surround and then we'll wrap
up with build logs of the week yeah we'd
a pretty good data NCIX today we got a
lot of cool stuff done yeah so guys
check this out if you've ever wondered
about sort of whether you should buy a
to a stereo headset or a surround
headset the answer for me has always
been if anyone can sort of fill in the
blank for me here let's see anyone on
anyone on twitch something something
something anyone on twitch blah blah no
no no if anyone could okay I always say
guys you got two years that's how many
speakers you need when the speakers are
right next to them however software
surround is a thing so if you check out
the virtual barbershop tour or whatever
it's called on YouTube and you're
wearing headphones it's a very cool
experience it really does feel like
you're you're in an environment and that
can be done in software I mean that one
wasn't done in software if I recall
correctly it was done using a microphone
array but that can be simulated in
software up until now we've relied on
individual headphone manufacturers to
provide that software to us so for
example Corsair with the Vengeance mm
headset has Dolby headphone technology
that was not in it and then added later
as a software upgrade so they haven't
changed the headset in any way
what Razer has
to do is just start go okay well we're
not gonna we're not gonna sort of worry
about any of that anymore we're just
gonna do surround software surround for
every headset so I haven't tried it yet
I just heard about it the other day and
I'm pretty excited to try it
Razer surround for child's play charity
has apparently raised $15,000 to date
that's kind of cool
that's awesome Joey was great speaking
of charity Linus tech tips for charity
has been down for a couple months we
haven't done a donation but we should
probably do something soon and then I
think we're probably gonna close out
that program because it doesn't seem to
be making any kind of a difference so a
few people are pretty hardcore about it
other than that no one seems to be yep
so I mean it's it's one of those things
where you know yeah we we thought we
were gonna kind of do something that was
gonna kind of make some kind of a
difference but it was uh it was a bit of
a bit of a failure in terms of the
effect that we were hoping that it would
have and how excited people were gonna
get about it so anyway Razer surround em
gives gamers the best virtual 7.1
channel surround sound experience with
any stereo headphones and I'm reading
this off their site so I don't actually
know that it's the best I haven't tried
it yet using state-of-the-art technology
the surround sound algorithms powering
Razer surround creates an unbelievably
accurate surround sound environment and
allows gamers to calibrate positional
sound to match their own unique
preferences I've seen these in software
surround solutions before where you can
actually move around the speakers and
decide exactly where you want the sounds
coming from I think that a lot of
hardcore gamers will still prefer to
have no processing delay on the sound
whatsoever and have this just stereo
sound out of two speakers or even
earbuds because that actually gives you
very strong positional audio as well but
for gamers that are looking for more
like the experience like if you're
playing games like Skyrim as opposed to
counter-strike something like this can
improve immersion I mean when we're
talking
surround sound plus Omni Plus oculus for
experience type games this is this is
just very very cool and I think it's
really neat that they don't lock it down
to razer headphones yeah so if you want
to use bear dynamics or Sennheiser or
even direct razer competitor
like guys like SteelSeries or logitech
razors kind of going okay go for it
we don't care you don't have to buy any
razor hardware at all but we've got
razor clums now razor surround I mean
synapse I thinks relies on their
hardware but other than that they've got
comms and surround and comms is quite
excellent comms is actually the software
we'll be using to test our call-in
feature in the after party so guys stick
around if you want to try if you want to
see how it works cuz I don't think we're
gonna allow general public to call in
just yet you done with that yet let's
find it you have to find out if I guy
usually I save it I know it's weird but
usually I save it to my download so
what's it called funny no bollocks
Friday June 28th it should be in the
live stream agendas folder live stream
agendas folder that's okay I got this I
got this
okay we are on this so it never really
looks that great when we open it this
way but we're gonna open it properly
because it never looks that great when
we open it this way wait you said that
right good work I won't have to fire you
today I haven't fired you in a long time
nope so this is a this is a wall-mounted
Home Server can they see me talking oh
they can see you J this is a
wall-mounted Home Server which is
freakin amazing all of these by the way
so this is by user comp LX
this is computer name is VX - 24 this or
wall-mounted 40 nice Lexia for the win
yay that was awesome if you you should
go check out all of these ones actually
this week especially you should go check
out the actual build because I tried to
get photos that you could see the whole
thing in but there is way better photos
to see specific parts of the build and
to see specific features and to get way
closer that is cool so he actually took
the stickers off the drives just to make
it look more clean young space-age and
futuristic sleeved cables which again
you can't see that great in this but
there is zoomed in shots that look way
better well it looks like it's built
into like a Wii Balance Board or
something so I think he custom made it
fan control there all the cables are
bundled together nicely at the bottom
here yeah and I
leave that the lights are on the outside
can change like it's it's awesome this
build is very cool we had a ton of we
have a whole bunch of builds that are
currently in progress that are on the
way and these are a few of them that
just got completed which are great
awesome this is another this is another
one where you have to see the other
angles of the system because I picked
this one so that you could see that
there is another side because with a two
sided when you're supposed to look at it
from two different sides you kind of
need to see different it's those sleeve
cables that video card yep
Wow like this build is amazing okay
someone's got a PNM and tell them to
remove those cheesy SLI covers notice
that that that's okay I mean I'm not
trying to be critical man but beautiful
build you got to see the other side as
well there's a big radiator on the back
a tubing and all that access use right
there that blue water I love this this
is fantastic is this metal construction
I checked that I do not know but it
doesn't like it Wow and there's no way
it would what a cool build okay guys so
go check out ZD mods build and then we
see a lot of our force but you'll know
exactly what happened with this
immediately look at the back so he
pulled out the entire back of the case
to put a triple alpha cool radiator in
there doesn't need a graphics card
apparently cuz this is a server build
there you go and what what I couldn't
include in this is the back panel of the
computer because you can see up at the
top there that he has nicely sleeved
cables and if you see the back he has
amazing runs going to his hard drives
they look you have to see the picture
like this 24 pin that's beautiful the
way that it's curves away like that yep
and he did lacing lacing that looks
amazing you got you gotta check out the
bill he got us I see the back and you
got to see his a little lacing guide
that he's very cool that's very awesome
so this this week was crazy we don't
usually do three builds this week was
nuts okay so guys I think that pretty
much wraps it up thank you for watching
the livestream and guys stay tuned for
the after party if you want to watch us
play video games and
sort of yeah if that's basically all you
want to do right now we're gonna play
we're doing this we're gonna test the
call in future oh we're gonna test the
call in feature so you'll basically just
be seeing how it's gonna work for next
week which might be a leg up maybe I
know how it works maybe they'll have a
chance to call in baby um I still yeah I
guess I still haven't gonna be
interested to see how this works but
yeah it might just totally not work it
did work in our test it did work in our
test so thank you guys for being awesome
and all tuning in and if you do prefer
we won't be upset if you go and watch
the tech which to my understanding
releases around this time Logan's
awesome and we also won't be upset if
you go watch the star citizen 24 hour
stream which is on right now they're
they're doing a big website overhaul and
a 24 hour stream where they're given
some big updates which we've been
missing because we're here but yeah so
that that's another option as well oh
I'm so stoked on Star says yeah yeah did
you see the 300 i cinematic nope I
haven't actually watched or looked at
any you have to see the cinematic a
anyone who's interested in star citizen
recent update just came out three
hundred I holy cow it's got the ship I'm
getting no no I don't think so I think
it's the ship I'm getting constellation
300 I I thought maybe it is I'm pretty
sure that's my ship 300 I I might be
quoting the wrong name as well oh but I
think a few of the names are super
similar 300 I
I mean we could do this on the after
party we should probably do this on
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
