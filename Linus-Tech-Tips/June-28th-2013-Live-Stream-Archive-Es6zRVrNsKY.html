tips live stream with special guest
slick well you were a special guest at
one point at the at the beginning yeah i
read like a long long time ago yeah that
was that was like six months ago no must
have been more it was it was december it
was before Linus media group split out
on its own yeah it was either December
or like late November yeah cuz that was
when my arm was missed oh yeah this is
up like you were in school still oh no I
was a long time ago wow that would have
been before but you're still special Oh
long set up that was that was a really
long set up and yeah nice that was
totally worthwhile so guys welcome to
the linus tech tips live stream the
we're gonna get pretty much right into
it with a twitter Q&amp;amp;A blitz so get your
twitter Q&amp;amp;A in right now well we just
give you some special messaging special
messaging from intel so guys if you
haven't checked it out intel gaming
promo calm is where you can check out
their gaming promo right now so it's a
pax prime promo if you buy a haswell cpu
if you know anyone who bought a haswell
cpu if you're going to buy a haswell cpu
so any fourth generation processor guys
it go sign up for this promo because you
have a chance to win the ultimate trick
to pax prime which basically amounts to
tickets and spending money and there's a
bunch of T's and C's on their website
but yeah if you know anyone who bought
one and they're willing to give you a
copy of the receipt and they don't care
about going to pax prime go do it now do
it now seriously because packs for our
tickets are actually really expensive
right now and really really hard to get
it unless like yeah yeah all of that
stuff so PAX Prime not paying for it yay
oh wow that's early this time there was
no like actual reason to even do it just
bail well I don't think we actually have
any EA news there's no that's that's
what I mean so we're just to just think
just take it a shot we also have some
really exciting news about the actor
party this week so we didn't manage to
96 super mario world but i think we kind
of give up its it's some ghost host
somewhere we can't tell because the
color on the pad doesn't change or
something and we basically we base yeah
we basically give up so we're not going
to bother doing that but what we are
going to do this live stream is we are
going to experiment with our system for
having live callers call in so we're
hoping to get that launched with a
special partner next week so we can do
live calling in which i think is going
to be just really cool we're basically
going to be caught up to radio at that
point in terms of technology almost yay
this bone every fist bump for something
failed you should be yeah sponsor Sen
watching we'll stop ripping on you quite
quite so hard yeah cuz we're still gonna
rip it alright let's go to the let's go
to the Twitter volunteer which is what
they call the phone boards when you're
on a radio show which is what will you
sort of directly compare yourselves
radio no yeah well we're basically like
radio but with video and I think the
things a little yeah if we didn't have
video then we wouldn't have these
technical difficulties yeah we should
just do a radio show people been asking
for it to be converted into podcasts or
Y media last last reg there was a
request for it to be podcasted that was
the top comment oh okay I'm putting you
in charge of that okay huh that was easy
look at this dad I love it podcasts okay
I like seriously heart podcast so I have
no problem with doing that okay and I
know like they don't get the craziest
amount of listeners but I love podcast
all right guys what technology on
computers do you think is behind the
best display is not good enough say it
or not fast enough etc you want to take
this one SATA in my opinion really yeah
I cuz I don't think it's that it at all
I think that what's actually too slow if
we're going to talk storage alone is
NAND flash because right now an SSD can
max out a SATA bus but not when it's
doing anything random yep yeah we're not
even close yeah the drives are not close
the controller's aren't fast enough the
NAND isn't fast enough NAND is still
wait like storage was so far behind and
then SSD was like uh-uh I mean you look
at how many orders of magnitude faster a
current cpu is compared to something 10
years ago and like how much fat even
with SSD and say 23 how fast storage is
but starting a close my angle on this is
you're completely right my angle on this
though is that the drive manufacturers
are not super incentivized to push
harder because when people are looking
at benchmarks they see it get capped out
and then they're like oh so it's a
difficult message yeah and it's hard to
sell yeah so why bother so why bother so
if so if the cap on SATA gets removed I
think there will be more incentive for
the drive manufacturers to push harder
well the one that I still feel more
strongly about then storage because as
you know I'm a storage dork like you've
seen the setup on my system eat SSDs
awesome which is by the way fast enough
now you're just saying I'm still gonna
go with this place because I see no
reason to me the thing that's most
offensive about displays is that we have
the technology for them to be there it's
it's stupid standards like HDMI holding
back everything and for people who are
like Oh HDMI is whatever no hdmi is not
anything good hdmi is inferior in every
way other than sighs I don't use it for
anything other than size it is inferior
in every way to DVI DVI can carry a
digital and analog signal super handy
when you have to output to something
analog DVI can carry twice the bandwidth
of hdmi DVI has a locking connector DVI
is much more difficult to break it can
handle more insertions HDMI sucks there
I said it and display
part cannot come soon enough in terms of
completely replacing HDMI but I still
like the fact that DVI can carry an
analog signal and if DVI got the same
kind of TLC that hdmi gets if it was
getting the double bandwidth and HDMI is
getting that finally gets it caught up
to DVI finally if DVI was getting that
we'd be able to do 4k 60 Hertz nothing
compressed no nothing with DVI no
problem so yeah DVI for the wind DVI
forever like respect to DVI can't do a
fail fizzbin no we can't because DVI is
amazing food umm so so display
interfaces are one of the things holding
it back but that's still not an excuse
because we have DisplayPort it is
capable of it if they can build a 1080p
screen this big then they can build a 4k
screen that's four times this big and I
don't care what the yields are because
you look at the bom cost for these
phones that includes process earn and
ram screen touchscreen interface chassis
everything if you're going to tell me
you can't build a 4k monitor that's like
24 inch for less than you know 500 600
bucks BS so displays are way behind and
it's offensive because we have the tech
or just refusing to use it because we're
putting everything into phones um ok
next one sorry that ended up going
pretty long ok shout out to dylan's
doubt it shout out to Stefano who are
both watching for the first time did you
sign any kind of a contract with not to
us I no actually I didn't apparently the
image is quite bad i don't think i think
it is a bit blurry cuz i think we were
sitting forward when we focused i can i
can try and fix it don't me to try and
fix it sure ok so were you guys it how's
that no that's way worse just kidding
how's that so sure hey that's better
maybe let's not like that ok good um no
we didn't sign anything with noctua i
think it's gonna be a long term thing
condone of taking my dad's 780 from the
build i built him with a 660 with my 660
ti he's in Ubben doesn't game the wrong
thing you did was not necessarily
swapping out a non gamers graphics card
but making a non-gamer by a seven
hundred dollar graphics committed first
place that wasn't cool man unless your
plan all along was to do the swap no
that makes him
worse cuz he's cuz cuz that's terrible
yeah you wouldn't do that to your dad I
hope your dad's watching I would get my
dad ended 780 but your dad games my dad
game yeah my dad does boink yes and my
dad would use that the same thing if
that card would be like Oh percent of
all time well i got my mom with 660 ti
as well cable that's but she used it cuz
she played skyrim okay she wanted that
computer to play skyrim okay is there no
there is no major FPS and performance
difference between those two things go
do you think in videos limiting sales of
shield by making it occlusive two gtx
card robin and including AMD they're
trying to buff their product line yeah
there may be an ecosystem yeah exactly
they're trying to make it so that you
are an nvidia customer so all the things
that you have that could be from the
video is from a video that and remember
that the way shield works is via a
proprietary nvidia technology like it's
the same kind of technology as we're
gonna see an nvidia grid where it sits
like centralizing the processing power
of the GPU and then streaming it
elsewhere it's like virtualizing GPUs
this is a proprietor i'm willing to bet
there's hardware in there for this like
i don't think this is as simple as wide
I that's not what we're doing and
technically they could open it up but
that would probably be a silly move yeah
why yeah why should they I I think
shields cool we didn't talk about this
last week she'll drop to 299 that's
that's really cool that's actually
awesome is that rings it go ahead that
brings it into a way way bigger price
point cuz the second you get under 300
bucks you're like at three hundred bucks
like if you spend half your paycheck and
you save half your paycheck you can
afford a shield with a paycheck is where
I think it gets down to like that's just
to the Affordable yeah like that to me
is what the 300 like the three hundred
dollar thing is like I could I could
wait a paycheck or two and I could say
it up paycheck or two yeah yeah but when
you have to start waiting a month for
something then it becomes tough becomes
a program yeah um honestly an IP I
honestly I didn't really see the
complaints about 349 in terms of the
competition that's out there because
when you look at the speck and you look
at the competing devices I mean how much
you pay for a phone what's it got on a
shield still the wireless antenna
mm-hmm still though logically the
difference between 2 99 and 349 it's not
that much right but perception
perception is huge once you get under
that exactly three hundred dollar mark
if cable TV DVDs and blu-rays all
broadcast at 60 Hertz is there a real
advantage to 120 Hertz TV if you game
with the pc on your TV then perhaps and
if you want to do the whole 3d thing
then yes and if you want to do that a
screen sharing thing where you can play
duel player games each wearing 3d
glasses and seeing a different full full
screen image then it's really cool as
well other than that no that is a few
different things though um here's a
question do you know the answer to this
why would someone want to be able to
digitally switch their power supply
between 1 12 volt rail and 2 + 12 volt
rail isn't it once you get to insanely
high voltages it's better to be on
multiple girls once you're drawing a lot
of current yeah it can be safer to have
their place but honestly if you're able
to switch between them then the reality
of it is your power supply has multiple
races and they're just being like
combined yeah so I wouldn't worry about
it too much these days the whole
multireal sent that was only relevant
for like six months yeah and it was a
wild that was like that was back when an
ocz power stream was a big deal yeah
this was quite a while you're making me
feel old it wasn't that long that ok was
a while ago it was a really what's a
good pirates life for a 2-way sli gtx
780 what would you buy two-way SLI you
take sony brand aside depends on your
chip remember how well the brand well if
i was just i would you better not one
overclocked evening hmm not when
overclocked though true Oh what powers
but why don't I go with another answer
while you think about that what's a
cheap ultrabook to get those below 700
bucks that is good that words good and
cheap and notebook rarely go together so
you get whatever ultrabook is the
quality you want and then you pay
however much that costs anything other
than an asus zenbook I I generally I
think that's sort of where they start in
terms of where I'd call it like a really
good quality ultrabook however the acer
aspire s3 the new one looks outstanding
whatever you do though if you're going
to buy an ultrabook today get a
haswell-based one because particularly
on nope
as well as a big deal it's actually
awesome lots more graphics performance
and much better power consumption power
consumption there's huge for me okay
power supply probably a 760 I because if
you're spending that much 760 okay I'm
sure you could make it in that
empowering yeah oh yeah it'll be fine
and um if you're spending that much on
graphics cards you're probably spending
that much on on the other parts new
system so I'm not too worried about
fitting a son 60 I into your budget and
you can buy a sleeping kit and those
sleeping kids are sweet that's tree okay
and then you don't have to spend all
that time sleeping your power supply and
that goes directly to the power supply
first leaving kit because some sleeping
kids are just extensions these thanks go
all the way to your power supply so to
look awesome and if you're spending that
much on a computer you probably want it
to look awesome so I don't know but
there's like there's a whole bunch of
other power supplies that i do like
pretty much she believes okay is
gigabyte the way to go for haswell
motherboards we actually haven't used
any of these yet these just arrived
they're not even open they're not even
open will a 450 watt SFX power supply
power a Haswell k series and a 780 are
you overclocking are you yeah if you're
not trying to overclock your gonna be
real borderline yeah it'll be on the
line like overclocking I wouldn't do put
one SSD in there maybe maybe don't have
an SS well you'll need a storage device
right yeah yeah like I wouldn't plug too
many like peripherals into the USB ports
I wouldn't do that actually uh I don't
know if he's buying not overclocked
maybe yeah but power spies are so cheap
but it's SFX he wants an SFX power
supply so I think for 15 the max is that
Silverstone one I think so as long as a
551 do they have a 550 irnos not enter
my man for fifty gold enermax has a five
think so okay we'll see if you can raise
a lung interesting at their booth that
was the highest watch I don't remember
what it was though so it might not be
that specific form best wireless hard
drive good question Voyager air has good
battery life wireless plus has a really
really stable app and the Patriot arrow
has good integration with third-party
players I mean none of them are bad to
be perfectly honest uh yeah from our
experience with them none of them just
like flake out so oh I just remembered
it was a
fameless' it wasn't uh oh okay yeah it
was something different ah ok I'm glad
you made it to josh max from the six
formula estimated price and release well
the price will probably look at a
maximum is 5 formula probably around
there and then thoughts I think the
formula board out of all the rog boards
is the one that makes the most sense
because it has that really high-end
audio solution on it that that makes me
feel really good about buying the board
because i'm not just getting like whoa
more USB 3 ports I'm getting something
that's really tangible and actually
costs money to put on the board like
engineering that audio solution took
time and money and building every single
one of them is expensive are you guys
getting JJ as a guest we don't have him
scheduled by any stretch of the
imagination but he's certainly welcome
to join us um we've talked about this a
fair bit in the past guys so we're gonna
leave that one for now ah what do you
think about studio-grade speakers do you
think it is good for anyone set up I'll
let you take this one um depends if
you're an audiophile or not I have what
are they called again those Corsairs
because this SP 2525 hundreds they're
awesome they were realistically pretty
cheap because I got them recertified at
ntx so it was an awesome deal um that
was a good deal that was freaking about
12 yeah and he heard you how to say well
I need another one for my wife talking
about it there's they're awesome
speakers but personally I I do
appreciate my audio equipment but I care
about headphones more speakers I got
those because there's a great deal and I
like it that they're loud I can hear
them in a room beside me and they sound
really good but I'm not going for
studio-grade speakers yeah i mean
honestly they're probably good yeah i
think that i'm sure yeah how is topher
compared to cherry also what's your
favorite keyboard go there really really
really different toper is I don't like
them taupe yeah they're they're they're
really different they're really premium
high quality very consistent feeling
switches um but they're not really
cherries you can't really compare them
directly to any switch people ask me to
do this all the time um they feel
nothing like cherries yeah at all no
uh-uh all not even close my favorite
keyboard
I depending on what variation of all the
prototypes that they released probably a
year the snake because they're talking
about rinsing releasing an aluminum now
what blue switches and I think you're
what Brown me I prefer brown switches
but my favorite keyboard is actually the
seibel 60 which has black switches so I
broke my own rule yeah someone says the
stream is leggy but that looks like the
only one he looks like the only one
complaining about it so I don't know
what to say is 170 Canadian a steal for
a second hand dill 1920 x 1200 monitor
yeah maybe depends what kind of
condition it's in if it's like a 2405
fpw like I have it's starting to fade
the black the backlights not very even
anymore and like make sure you see it
make sure there's no dead pixels or
anything any thoughts on the monoprice
$58 blue switch met keyboard monoprice
is known for high quality and low price
I've heard it's made kind of like it's a
low-end blue keyboard but it's also a
blue keyboard 68 bugs God MX blues for
58 bucks what do you want me to yeah
what happened he stated but maybe get
some posters for the wall yeah we had
that last week and we have posters we
have on order did you place the order I
haven't actually put it in ok we're
ordering a bunch of cool swag for the
office from thinkgeek so that's gonna be
cool ah my computer won't post i sent
the mobile for our main we see the same
one repaired still the same issue um
could be something else could be ram
could be power supplies you can swap but
if you have other kids of r &amp;amp; friends
with it trying to uh put your ram it
sois it ok a big thing so let's get into
our first topic because i think we've
done a pretty pretty good out twitter
Q&amp;amp;A blitz there haha so here we go let
me just make sure I have this I think
that I have this setup right so we
should be able to yes yes yes I do and I
think now that marks on them I monitor
oh oh and I just did the thing as an
arrow shake and everything went away
alright so Sony and Disney will begin
streaming movies that are still in
theaters in a bold move against piracy
mm so let's just give you the quick
summary so this is on the verge in a bid
to limit movie piracy in Asia so this is
not happening in North America in the US
theaters will still be getting their
90-day exclusive period sonian Disney
have begun testing a bold new on-demand
service in South Korea which offers
movies too
rent while they are still playing in
theaters so they've done this before
this isn't the first time and there's
been a lot of pushback from the theaters
they rely very heavily like very heavily
on that exclusive period because quite
frankly I don't know about you but if I
had the choice whether to pay twelve
dollars for watching the movie at the
theater actually I mean you can get us
sleep is like nine bucks but it's just
my books but then that's also per person
yep so if i could pay twelve bucks to go
watch in the theater or if I could sit
at home and watch it on my 52 inch TV
with my surround sound setup that like
quite frankly is pretty good um why do i
why am I going to a theater while i'll
make my own popcorn for 39 6 certain
movies i think i would still go see cuz
certain movies that man still yeah
damnit big action like superhero movies
like superhero movies big action movies
I just don't throw Avengers 2 I can't
believe they got Robert Downey jr. like
yes for two more anyway go ahead stoked
Robert Downey genies one of my favorite
actors she's awesome he's so good who
can be Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes I
know it's so awesome anyways um mind you
he play he does them kind of the same
doesn't matter I know it was awesome
awesome okay so was I saying yeah this
okay so there's the theater experience
with big action movie stuff like that
where you want the like insane yes you
have pretty good sounds down but when
you want the insane room shaking
surround sound and the big freaking
screen and all that kind of stuff like
that's cool and we'll still pull people
of theaters a little bit but certain
genres I think we'll get really hurt by
that right okay and I mean it's like I
think for big blockbuster movies this is
going to be less of a thing but one of
the examples of when they tightened the
window from 17 weeks to 12 weeks on
alice in wonderland in the UK ireland
and italy alison wonderland was nearly
not screen by theaters they were just
like nope forget i mean wasn't a good
movie for one thing okay i didn't see it
oh it was terrible was terrible is like
it was just like Johnny Depp and makeup
which quite frankly is awesome that's
how bad the rest of the movie had to be
I was gonna say like why is that bad I
know he's so hot oh dear um mm-hmm this
one's oh this one's your topic so next
one up is from Reuters microphone to
bring xbox and pc games to apple and
android phones I didn't read into this
22 specifically but there was um yeah
basically exactly what he already said I
think this is an interesting move
they've done stuff like this before
where they support certain things but
like they say right there Microsoft's
age of empires will be available select
like old game yeah but free to play
they're not releasing any of their like
insane stuff but they're just opening
the platforms a little bit that's that's
it that's is I mean is that an ok couple
things number one is that an
acknowledgement that Windows Phone 8 is
done or isn't an acknowledgement that
they don't care because they're getting
their licensing fees on Android devices
at this point yeah and at the same time
like huge licensing fees and at the same
time they're uh what is it they're
getting at HTC One Windows Phone 8
version yeah so I think so because
they're still pushing right so so I
think this is just them going okay this
isn't like our biggest title let's just
see what happens just see what happens
let's open the floodgates because I
don't think people are gonna like switch
a platform so they can play age of
empires know or maybe there's a few but
like there isn't going to be a huge wave
of be and if you would choose your
smartphone based on which one can play
an age of empires then like power to you
power to you that's not Annie a fist
bump no you're hardcore yes it's not an
EA game cuz it's good haha um but I
don't like I don't think it's gonna that
is not gonna be the tipping point for
that many people buying phones so I
don't think they think it really matters
how much you know it it's funny it
almost seems at this point like like
Microsoft is giving more cares to like
Apple platforms and Google platforms
then to their own windows platform like
it has been it has been a serious thorn
in my side to this day that halo doesn't
get the same support on PC that it does
on X
I'm sorry Microsoft what made you big
exactly was it xbox that's so annoying
his xbox or xbox one halo 1 i'm on pc
was awesome and we got it like way later
yeah we didn't get co-op nope like uh I
still ended up playing halo 1 on my what
you can call an original xbox yeah I
know right because what uh um because it
came out so much earlier I didn't even
hear about the pc release how I figured
out about the pc release was I saw it
like one of my friends had it I was like
what why was there not tons of news
around this I don't know I mean my whole
thing is is like one man boycotting if I
don't like something I won't buy it so I
wouldn't touch halo 4 xbox because it
was so offensive to me that it was not
available for PC second it came out for
pc i bought it second halo 2 came out
for pc i bought it not gonna buy it for
xbox I'm not gonna do it same thing my
local cable provider the reason I don't
have a cable TV subscription is that
they don't support cable card and I
think it's BS that the Canadian telcos
will not support cable card well okay
telecommunication on tree Alito well
they're kind of all telcos at this point
yeah I don't know whatever anyway the
content providers up here will not
support cable cardin every time they
call me they call me like once every two
months at least hey we noticed you have
internet with us do you want a cable TV
no please put a note on my file don't
call me again until you have cable card
because I refuse to pay for things where
they're gonna have unban t consumer
policies that just limit the way I can
use my devices and are offensive to me
as a customer so there well when I was
on my student plan with Shaw they called
me to be like hey do you want like cable
service and was like can you give me a
free TV they're like what I was like I
don't run a TV if you won't make a cable
service I need a TV I guess I was like
ah did they stop calling you yep you
should be like well will tell us gives
you a free computer with your internet
side Oh like you guys should give you a
free TV make sense to me if I want to
use your service
I have to have a device user service on
I was just trying to get a free TV else
is gonna cancel the plan draft there's a
student plans and it costs anything is
terrible yeah that's terrible all right
I'll have it for the minimum amount of
time now we're not talking about this um
next one is an article from The Guardian
which I'm having a little bit of trouble
with my touch screen here I want this to
grow grow really okay fine whatever
blackberry shares fall sharply after
smartphone maker posts shock loss
traders / 1.2 billion from the company's
valuation do they have 1.2 billion left
in their valuation I think they still
have 3.1 billion dollars of cushion okay
after revealing a 169 million dollar
loss following poor sales of the new z10
and q10 phones here's what I want to
know what's this loss shocking that's
what I found so confusing was because
they estimated three million units sold
I was like why did you estimate three
million unit so i think it's three
million units another server exactly one
day this is the problem with forecasting
like when i started Linus media group my
uncle's like will do you have a business
plan and a forecast I'm like no I know
approximately how much revenue we can
make if we do all these things right and
I know our viewers are gonna support us
and I know all these things and we're
gonna kind of go for it it's gonna be an
adventure I don't know how much of this
I'm really supposed to go into but when
we were at Omni you were like so what
are all your numbers and he had a few
and stuff but he's like yeah but I'm
kick-starting it so we're gonna see what
happens these are all my papers like it
doesn't matter and the guy comes from a
financial background yeah lake so he
understands he understands what a
forecast is which should give you some
idea why he thought it was just
pointless to have like like he had some
idea you kind of put feelers out there
and you're like okay well you know are
people gonna support me and this is how
well semi similar products there's no
some there's nothing that sort of his
butt likes and I similar VR stuff
pre-orders for rift yeah
okay well if I get this percentage this
if this number of people who want a rift
also want an omni then okay then it kind
of works out yeah so don't forgo let's
thinking about it but like but at the
end of the day like it's like oh you
know analysts need to see you know a
forecast and when your Intel and your
business is predominantly run rate like
Intel CPUs they can they could
manufacture them a year out and they'd
have a pretty good idea of how many
they're gonna need because it's just
once the numbers get big enough there's
kind of there's some variation but
there's like there's a flow to it it
evens out I remember showing you this
when I was still working at NCIX and I'm
like yeah i can predict how many cpus
are gonna sell to within like 10 plus or
minus 10 on a given week and you're like
no I'm like yeah it's like if I drop the
price this much it'll be this many plus
or minus 10 boom there's a long weekend
so it's going to be this many plus or
minus 10 just I don't get it like your
logic and I bet the logic of many of you
out there is if there's like a product
launch then everyone buys it and then
like sales go like this and then they
like go like this for the rest of the
park not at all apparently not 8800 gtx
had a boost and it's sold like this and
it was flat it sold exactly the same
throughout pretty much its entire
lifetime sometimes growing for
seasonality and that card was current
for over a year yeah I cart is freakin
awesome Avery over a year it was just
solid and it's like why and the answers
look at the steam hardware survey the
the number of people who actually
upgrade every generation it's like super
small if Nvidia didn't release a
graphics card for three years there'd
still be plenty of people to buy
graphics cards lots lots of people to
buy graphics cards the fact that they
move so fast is kind of baffling to me
they don't have to Amy an nvidia are
just keeping each other yeah check yeah
it's like they're trying to make sure
that when you do go to the store that
they have the fastest one yes even
though they don't really need them don't
really need to but I appreciate that
they have defense
that there try so so anyway so
blackberry I mean you know what maybe
this is a good opportunity to talk about
your experience with the z10 you spent
time over a month with it yep I will
talk with that one quick second I want
to jump back to the article on a new big
guy that's a part of blackberry stuff it
has been talking and saying okay guys
worst in highness I think that's it yeah
don't remember some dude he's probably
some dude from blackberry that's really
really high up um basically it's going
like okay give us a little bit because
like honestly they didn't do that bad if
you have realistic expectations of what
they're supposed to do in the rd
involved in two new flagship smartphones
is like not trivial or they have to hit
a market that they weren't hitting for a
while yeah and like they're they're
trying to get into new markets they're
trying to do all this new stuff like
there needs to be some growing time like
people were like okay you really see new
smartphone oh you're not doing that well
kill you well it's because everyone's
used to Apple and Samsung results yeah
exactly but then again HTC i think has
demonstrated that someone who's
basically down for the count can have a
blockbuster smartphone yes and maybe
blackberry should have done an android
OS release but they didn't what if me
who that would have been terrible
message though yes and no what if they
did a blackberry version of android OS
they could have their switching between
business and normal mode would you buy a
z10 if it was an android phone I like
buttons no okay if it had buttons I
don't like the screen how do you see how
do you differentiate an android phone
but only cuz rather than spend a bloody
fortune on something that's basically
unmanufactured by almost anyone else the
back of the z10 was very nice like most
of the things about it was nice I didn't
like likes the back I didn't like the
screen taken because it was like in
panels it clean you remember that oh
yeah right it didn't have a very good
it's like grease resistant it was weird
I never had a touch screen like that
before in my entire life and I mean what
was your takers okay having tried to
switch to blackberry would you could you
possibly have switched from Android to
blackberry knowing everything you know
now personally I would not want to yeah
like I say is the conclusion video yet
it went out last night okay like I
thought the end okay
again yes haha so many comments on the
previous one or like you're doing this
and there's nothing to click a lot Oh
anyways um I would not do it personally
I would suggest that certain people do
do it specifically one of my friends
dads who's Victor business and has to
keep up on things like emails and text
messages and all that kind of stuff it
very quickly it's good for that because
he doesn't actually want to spend that
much time on his phone doesn't play game
doesn't play games doesn't do all that
kind of stuff but needs to be able to
answer emails and everything quickly and
then put his phone back away but Android
is so customizable that you can probably
give up with some solution that's over
the good but that's built in and ready
to go immediately that's true you don't
have to fight with it and I think if
there's any or get it oh no it's okay i
can get it cuz i think you're the next
one as well white house petition
something's cheering so so cover that
one but i think the thing with the thing
with blackberry is that it's ready done
and not everyone's a phone bar right oh
yeah yeah you're gonna need that scene 3
shows them this cream okay oh sorry guys
yeah so basically for the right user the
person that doesn't want to sit down and
constantly be customizing their phone
awesome for the right user someone who
wants to be able to do their social
media and interactions very very quickly
I just said very very oh man um for
someone who wants to do it extremely
quickly it's it's great but for me I
want to do more with my phone and it
tries to be an android phone with its
sideloading apps which is cool if you're
someone who already has one or bought it
for a specific reason but then once
additional functionality but for me I
would just want to buy an android phone
because it just makes more sense to me
so moving on I'm going to try and figure
out how I'm supposed to do this on by
this is laptop give me one quick second
oh it's exactly we're just looking at
okay I'm gonna have troubles getting to
it but I can start talking about it
before I get to it basically different
states are not allowing car
manufacturers to sell directly to
individual personal clients so they want
you to go
to like they want you to what they're
called car park they're not called the
car park Wow I don't know what they're
called anyways where they sell cars then
when you go there and buy it in person
instead of getting it directly from the
manufacturer so Tesla only does their
business that way so because there are
certain states not allowing it anymore
someone has created a I think his name
is Tim and he's not old and he's not
allowing his last name to be put out but
someone has made a petition to the White
House to make them stop this from
happening because it will essentially
kill Tesla's business it is not a person
from Tesla it is someone who has
investment in Tesla and plans on buying
a Tesla he's a he's a fan of Tesla but
he's not actually an employee of Tesla
Motors come on I just got to try and
open this up so right now the petition
has 300 not 336,000 500 signatures it
needs a hundred thousand signatures in
the article it says that they had about
like 10k or something but since then
it's gone up quite a bit did you do to
do I just kind of try and get the guys
name here we go article finally open
three what is this what we got something
hey it's not opening my press three it's
not opening oh that's cuz that's the UH
alright dude you need seen three you're
so quickly okay sorry about back we got
our run I got our vengeance pro memory
oh that's cool yeah Danny we go ahead I
basically finished the article i just
wanted to show people at once i finally
got it on screen well that's from cnet
what did I scroll there we go here let
me get this ah ooh that dot ooh micro
HDMI do do hate not caught on something
there and it's worked now Oh No Oh micro
HDMI let's try on wooden it be funny if
that connector just hardcore bro there
we go both suck hey micro USB 8 micro
HDMI and it's pro 2 by eight gig there
we go wait we're doing a video about it
yeah we're gonna do a video about it
it's basically it's just got more
overclocking Henry minute compared to
yeah just compared to does it have any
lighting your ring oh no no it's just uh
it's just clean looking over a notice
really simple memory black PCB this one
right here is in 1866 c9 kit 16 gigs
cool okay awesome all right should we do
Twitter Q&amp;amp;A blitz sure people seem to
like so so guys send in your Twitter
questions and we are going to do one
more article in the meantime so you you
came up with this one but I'm gonna I'm
gonna go ahead and filled it cuz it's an
easy one sure uh him so there's a team
from Vancouver Island which happens to
be very close to Vancouver not an island
which is where we live specifically from
Victoria thank you really from Victoria
which happens to be the capital of BC
although it shouldn't be because it's on
an island just stupid haha so this is n
nah makosinski Ann makosinski I hope I
said that right she has some kind of an
accent that would indicate that that's
an appropriate last name for her and she
has done something pretty cool so this
is a flashlight it has three LEDs
there's actually a video on the article
this is on Times columnist and so three
LED flashlight that is powered using
only the heat given off by your hand
when you hold it so she demos it at the
very end of the video just skip to the
end because the whole beginning of it so
she was she's one of the 15 finalists ah
about the list of 90 regional friend
analysts from around all over the world
for Google science yeah so so for
Google's global science fair and I just
think it's really cool that she's local
and she explains how she had to do a lot
of analysis and testing for how much
heat per per square centimeter your heat
gives off and then how much heat you can
use what it sounds like she's basically
using the Peltier effect right to it
certain I I didn't listen too closely
but it did sound like it yeah so heating
one side cooling another side using mb
and tear and then generating an electric
current by doing that so she was able to
determine that yes you could build us a
flashlight and she built the flashlight
and all she does is hold it and the LEDs
go on it's not super bright or anything
but but in some type of disaster
kit or a bug-out kit or something like
that where your batteries might run out
and you might be left dry this is
awesome because if you're using your
cell phone for flashlights if you're if
you're using a normal flashlight they
both have potential to run out of
batteries and die oh and I think
probably the most notable part of all of
this is the fact that she's 15 yeah so
she's already a hundred times smarter
than I'll ever be which is cool yeah
that's awesome good work we need people
like that good work and yay flashlights
real fist bump nadie ok Twitter Q&amp;amp;A boom
have you tried out windows 8.1 preview
no I heard the start menu still isn't
great yeah and I mean honestly my issues
with windows 8 run a little deeper than
just that anyway so yeah if I had a
sound card and headset and sp25 hundreds
would you get better sound by plugging
directly to the sound card or can you
use the SP 2500 in good question if you
have a soundcard with a headphone amp
plug into it directly if you don't then
it probably doesn't matter and the SP
2500 zamp can help you right that's what
i do i switch on the card instead of on
that it would be nice if i could but i
don't want if you ball a little bit
harder you could have an awesome sound
card and an external heavy yeah yeah but
and i barely use my computer I know
Saturday night I it's so nice though
that oh I love the essence one just even
plugging like my in-ear pros into it
they do sound better they do sound
better it's just all weird yeah we're
talking about his owner essence one yes
oh I love it totally honest would you
recommend a Razer Kraken pro or a
SteelSeries Siberia v2 as far as build
quality and sound quality goes um
neither of those are really at the top
of my list as far as sound quality goes
neither of them are poorly built though
if I was looking for just kind of like
your your run-of-the-mill kind of gaming
headset Siberia v2 is definitely gets a
thumbs up super lightweight very
comfortable and it has a good Mike those
to me are the gaming requirements is if
if you're someone who spends a huge
amount of time on voice chat people
appreciate a good Mike and I don't have
any personal experience of the Kraken
pro meanie dick but I have quite a few
friends that have Siberia v2 s because
they're pretty cost effective and the
mics on them will not give that super
annoying snow effect yeah to the entire
chat room yeah the whole time you're in
it generally speaking if you buy a
SteelSeries headset you're getting a
good Mike yeah that's I've never
encountered one of those that doesn't
have you seen the achieve q I have not
yet sorry ah that's a duplicate guys
please avoid sending messages multiple
times if we see that we're not going to
answer your message this is on here like
four times hey from the UK how UK 430
watt power supply enough for this config
yeah should be fine but I don't know if
too many 430 watt power supplies that
aren't total like bollocks so if it's a
good one then great and there we go
thank you that good i think that's
actually spelled wrong but that's ok ok
ah yo guys watching the live stream from
the UK hello oh hi to UK again should we
really say hi to the same country twice
yeah if they're really cool yeah UK is
pretty cool yeah ahhhh oh my gosh we
have 4000 live viewers that can't be
right you guys rock it must be able to
no it's not on there it's on that here
you guys used to be on there that's cool
yeah you guys are awesome that's real
apparently it's like it that's why two
people from the UK are rms yeah uh is it
normal for my 692 not hit a hundred
percent usage on both gpus you wanna
handle this one I do notice not very
much one hundred percent normal yeah one
hundred percent normal because SLI is
only in very rare circumstances such as
synthetic benchmarks going to be able to
fully utilize both gpus that is totally
normal don't worry buddy look at the
cores on your cpu too yeah same thing
yeah ah sing me happy birthday we can't
actually oh yeah it's yeah it's like a
trademark copyright yeah thing if we do
that or even think it's that cheap no
it's not it's really expensive you're
not actually go look it up you're not
allowed to sing happy birthday that's
why you've probably never heard it on TV
or in a movie if you do hear it in
movies it's like it's the change it it's
usually a big thing or they change it
like future futurama it's like
what day is today it's Lee last birthday
it's something something something so
let's all have some cake like you can't
sing it that's why nobody does it yeah I
will you be upgrading your rig anytime
soon no no I have a 590 and a 39 70 x I
got eight SSDs and raid 0 I got a lot of
lacking their dual rad quadrat I have as
owner um xonar well I don't remember
what it's called me mories on our zentz
that's the know that I didn't know we
were what are you talking about the
decadent Evanescence 10 yes yes actually
I upgraded my rig today but I thought
they weren't well they're not here yet
but oh I thought they like I thought you
weren't getting it oh no I i left the
back order in i'm gonna just wait till
there's another one ah so today i bought
myself i treated myself to two pb278q s
oh that's got to be my favorite monitor
very low input leg beautiful IPS panel
or pls panel rather um not sir not
calibrated out of the factory but i have
a calibrator a good one too i have a
good calibrator so i'll be able to get
pretty much pro a performance out of it
not quite oh and it's 27 inch the only
thing i don't like about it is that it's
16 by 9 and i really did think about
going for PA to four sixes yeah just
because of all the color depth oh um but
anyway i'm going dual dual monitor which
I've never done on my personal system
never done that do water yeah it's nice
it's really nice especially if you get
um okay i would highly recommend
displayfusion okay that's that thing I
was talking about where he should an
episode about that we should actually ok
it's on steam now too is it it's on
steam software that's how any computer
you go to you can be like but BAM
displayfusion ok tell them about it and
don't point out that screen because they
can't see it I don't know enough about
it like if we're gonna do a video about
it i'll research it more but these are
the things that I care about and the
reasons why I got it can do a lot more
than this but this is specifically why I
wanted it but I went to windows 8 my
favorite thing was that it would bring
start menu and taskbar on both your
monitors and you could have independent
background turning on both your mom
that's cool yeah displayfusion can do
that so I thought I was like the one
reason you held out with windows 8 for
some long I had so many things like
weren't working I couldn't play certain
games I had so many problems which ended
up being a combination of things but it
was including windows 8 whatever so I
went back to windows 7 and bought
displayfusion that was my thought was my
thing so displayfusion is great whenever
I go to use anyone else's computer that
has dual monitors I feel like I have a
handicap now because I'm like why can't
I where's my start menu bah it's so
annoying I display features amazing will
do video about it yeah so that's that's
cool so someone asks our sandisk SSDs
reliable sandisk is one of the few SSD
manufacturers that actually owns fabs so
like all the other guys who own fabs
micron Samsung they are keeping the best
for themselves I would say yes sounds
and discuss sd's are a good way to go ah
you're awesome Thank You Isaac you're
awesome too it probably means you're
awesome too yay good job he said you're
awesome too no I don't know please make
a video of the Gambia's headphones I
gandia is gonna send us stuff once it's
ready so gonna happen cool paint the
wall green so you can make it a green
screen and have fun with it that would
actually be kind of cool xsplit supports
it natively remember the one time that
we had my shirt that was weird i don't
know what caused that cuz i never
changed the settings oh yeah i don't
know i'm just saying the vagine' that
happened the whole wall love the show
says Celine thank you yay I bought a new
keyboard CM storm quickfire rapid with
cherry MX black which switches you
prefer for gaming brown blue okay do you
think unified memories gonna come to pcs
by broad well no mu how much will it
cost to watercool is CP and GPU custom
Lou probably a few hundred bucks yeah a
little more if um TV 655 get a proper
pump yeah proper pump yeah no I agree
and you can do the problem is you can
code of like any extent so it depends
what you're gonna do with it you could
go with a swiftech h220 add a GPU block
that's 240 then you probably still need
another rad which you could probably get
for 60 bucks for barb fittings that'll
be really cheap so if you book I
probably come with them yeah 300 using
us using a swiftech h220 i get a gtx 760
or 7970
between those two I mean those aren't
even in the same price range man no
that's crazy okay thoughts on Windows
8.1 I need transparency I don't know if
you're talking about Aero glass because
i need arrow blast too where is he
talking about reviewer transparency um
well I haven't tried 8.1 so I can't be
transparent or opaque yeah what do you
think of Canadian service providers
basically cheating the people of data my
provider is actually pretty good on
they've never really boned me just
server survivors is he talking book is P
your phone could be either I bet neither
of my eye I you Sean I use Bell and
neither of them have ever really screwed
me for isp we've gone way over our limit
yeah multiple times and Shaw was just
like I'm sure we're doing it here
already yeah so they don't really seem
to care shot at least doesn't seem to
care so that's awesome it depends on
your area it's just how consumer
friendly they are and out here it's for
isps it's basically Sean telus and Telus
is so good that they are bad that they'd
make sure look good no matter what Sean
did but Shaw seems to generally try to
be pretty consumer friendly which is
nice which is nice uh phones you get
screwed but everyone gets screwed
everywhere with phones yes I'm like it's
not specifically bad it's like how would
you like to be screwed yeah it's
basically the conversation you get to
have when you go into the store yeah
it's like how exactly do you want to get
screwed me happy it's like and choose
diameter and choose positions and you
can choose whatever you want but at the
end of the day your students group it's
gonna happen uh Jack Ellis asks to for a
tease in sli or 1 760 and what happened
to your model M so I'll take the first
half uh sure I'd go 760 I way less heat
output way less power consumption um
more modern solutions single card is
generally better than dual go part of
how we dried the camera when it got
water damage exhaust from the 480 that
is not part of that is how Oh try to the
caprica so like that should speak enough
to that answer the model M is still it's
like it's pretty much raring to go the
problem is the stabilizers on all the
keys that need stabilizers are broken
all of them so what I need to do is it
general the keyboards in very good shape
so I want to keep that one and what I
want to find is another model M who's
maybe the PCBs broken or the connectors
broken or something that is disabling it
from being able to work entirely and I
want to take the keys off of that and
utilize the stabilizers on my current
model M which would make it fully
functional and in very good shape so but
still in progress but these are supposed
to be like blitzes but I have a 7970
gigahertz addition i'm planning to
upgrade my cpu and this year's black
friday what cpu would you recommend
gaming only um murcia I'm afraid we're
gonna have to let you know we'd need to
know your current cpu that's really
important so maybe post it on the linus
tech tips for him in fact everyone go go
post something on the linus tech tips
for him now because the linus tech tips
for him is awesome and everyone should
be a member of it we had actually i want
to take a moment here and be super proud
of our forum real quick there was a
conversation on the the new legislation
in the US that was to do with homosexual
marriage and as we all know this is an
extremely touchy topic it is very
polarizing people get super upset there
was a four page thread that had a back
and forth exchange between some of our
members civil and it did not get out of
hand there I was so impressed we the mod
team I love my ma team they're all
amazing but we watched these kind of
threads like hawks because we don't want
them to go out of control but I've seen
a theme lately where we can let a lot of
these style topics just kind of go I
mean on any other forum that's read the
train wreck yeah it's a train wreck and
everyone hates each other by the end of
it and generally speaking our policy
when we discussed it is we're not gonna
allow these controversial topics really
ought to exist on our forum because we
don't want it to become a hate fest yes
if you're having a civil discussion we
want a respectful forum where people
yeah you know leave that out of it go
argue about that somewhere else but
let's come here and let's all cooperate
and let's talk about technology yeah but
if people can handle it I mean it's fine
that is so cool yeah like that's just
really cool yeah so yeah we love that we
love that um all right moving right
along is two or three monitor setup
worth it for gaming personally I prefer
single monitor for game
I have a to monitor setup when I'm
gaming my second monitor either is black
or has like my voice comp chat windows
on it so if Apple upgraded their 27-inch
Thunderbolt displayed a 5k for the same
price would you buy it sure I would be
awesome um blah no idea Gilbert sorry
o.o what I'm putting in the okay what's
a good power supply 750 is fine for that
look tell us look it's called a
dealership I'd forget I've forgotten
what the name of the place was where you
went to go buy cars okay dealerships
grocery stores grocery store no just
places where you buy oh yeah nothing oh
 oh okay kiosk we're improving
slicks vocabulary one step at a time I
mean you'd be looking for a dealership
you'd have to comb that sound wreck
asking people where they're the
dealership is where's where's that place
where you like go look at cars and stuff
ah Ethan asks if will sign a side panel
if we pay for shipping honestly dude you
don't want to pay for shipping to us
it's gonna be like spend a couple
hundred bucks don't do it a good
mechanical keyboard for one hundred and
eighty dollars anything you want yeah
man go for it and 7990 benchmarks we're
actually you know what here I'm gonna
I'm gonna stop the Twitter blitz cuz I
want to talk about this 7990 benchmarks
we can't really run them properly
because we don't have a frame capture
setup um sorry cuboid I mean it's on the
bedroom right there yeah uh in fact if I
if I aim this at it you might be able to
see it I know there it is can't really
tell what it is yeah that is it that's a
7990 on a test bench um we can't do it
yet and we need a two-thousand-dollar
capture card so we've been having some
discussions we're talking about maybe
doing a Kickstarter to help us afford
one we've been trying to find a sponsor
to help us afford one ah it's hard as a
sponsor to show though justify that I
mean we did have a sponsor step up and
provide us with for ssds that we could
use for this because you need that type
of storage solution to be
like it's hard to properly test frame
rating on campus yeah um because right
now the numbers we'd get would be kind
of useless yeah but what we were
thinking about doing in the meantime is
benchmarking it and then doing a
double-blind test with him and then a
double-blind test with me to see if that
difference between the reported FPS and
the perceived FPS which we can't measure
but we all know exists is something that
we can perceive so we were going to do a
blind taste test 7990 versus gtx titan
to see which one we think feels faster
or if we can even tell so I thought that
might be a cool angle we're gonna do
like dual 7 80s yeah so that it's a
similar price range and two cards it's
not of course a combined card but it's
still two cards we still need another
785 still you know 780 but we'll figure
out something to Titans what we have to
do it SI we have another 780 in the mail
though yeah okay so we'll do 27 80s but
like that's we were thinking of doing
that so that there's no investment
because we can't buy it to the store
capture card um but yeah um I don't say
yeah yeah I do Kickstarter something we
are trying to release benchmarks of this
kind of stuff and we want to release
higher end graphics card benchmarks like
higher end as in not the graphics card
but as in the theory that goes into it
yeah but want to be more scientific yeah
but you know what right now we're gonna
have to blitz some topics here sure um
did you do the ISP in New Zealand nope
okay let's do that is get it on so where
did my livestream don't go days there we
go so there's an ISP in New Zealand that
is releasing a I think it's called
global mode it's somewhere in there I
think it's called global mode which
hides your locational and allows you to
access services that our country bound
everyone's seen on YouTube will not
everyone but you'll have seen on youtube
or it's like you can't watch this video
in your region or anywhere else really
that's really annoying places like
comedy central no reason for the longest
time South Park was streamable in Canada
then it got gonna go next yeah so this
will allow you to view it wherever stuff
like Netflix i know i think net netflix
us requires a united states credit card
now or something possibly something's
going on there but like other services
that just check for your region it's
allowing you to get around it and it's
the ISP level I know there's other ways
to do this it's not the idea isn't
completely revolutionary but it's very
streamlined which is cool that's very
cool so the way that their marketing
this at him is as a service that allows
visitors to New Zealand to access the
same online services that they would at
home yes wow that's the sketches balls I
don't think anyone believed that but
that's very cool I mean speaking of ISPs
that are actually trying to do something
to help their customers as opposed to
just maintain the status quo that's very
cool and out of out of Australia New
Zealand of all places where typically
Internet policy wise they've been in the
dark ages for a while for well since the
dark ages ah no offense to anyone from
there but I think you guys know better
than us yeah how horrible it is there so
we have 4,400 live viewers right now
that's I think I've record so I think so
you guys are awesome let's awesome yeah
so let's move into our next topic which
is that uh 21 year old receives a 25
million dollar funding this is from a
bunch of different corporations a bunch
of different groups 25 million dollars
for a payment app they're not releasing
a lot of information about it but
basically he his whole thing is that
he's been frustrated having to carry
around a wallet with credit cards and
cash in it and he wants to be able to do
it through your phone this type of thing
has been kind of flopped around for a
really long time I'm interested it's
going to a 21 year old and not something
like Google Wallet or PayPal yeah
because this I think it's called clinkle
or klinke or something like that klinkel
clinkle it's so it's going to be a new
app there isn't a ton of information
about it yet it's not even out yet it's
not even developed yet fully the clinkle
website said it says it is rebuilding
the analog wallet from the ground up to
bring you the future of payment and
dublin duplin lucas whatever okay first
name Lukas is keeping quiet about what
it actually does so there's something
big coming if all these there's it names
a few players in there I don't remember
who but there's a bunch of big companies
putting big
money behind this okay so Intel former
Facebook COO Owen van natta and wireless
technology company Qualcomm have all
invested their money and faith in him so
like yeah this is gonna be a big deal
like what if you wanted to happen or not
this is gonna be a big deal huh very
cool so soon I think we will have the
option to pay with things with our phone
so get this at the same time like we're
at such a crossroads at the same time
will you will be able to pay with metal
you'll be able to pay with paper you'll
be able to pay with plastic you'll be
able to pay with plastic electronically
you'll be able to pay by writing on a
piece of paper that you commit to pay it
i mean come on checks still exist really
and you'll be able to pay just by like
whipping out your phone this is very
interesting because when I was in Korea
they had this thing called t-money I
don't have it on me but it's basically
it looks like a credit card or you can
get other forms of it which are dhoni
sure it wasn't like a us rapper unless
t-pain I know it's t-money radio
ridiculous imani humor um so it's so I
was paying for my stuff and then I got
bored so I pulled out my wallet and then
came the horde of people who were making
me not able to pay so i thought i'd make
an app called crinkle happy day haha
it's actually pretty good el money el
money oman thank you there you go okay
so basically what it was was you tap it
on whatever you had to pay for you could
get certain stores supported this so
what I was worst worst freestyle ever
come on it was pretty good I was pretty
good okay you can pay for certain things
for it at stores you can pay for taxis
with it you can pay for any form of
transit and like it's awesome it's very
cool and all you had to do was tap it on
the thing i believe it was through NFC
like so cool and it was so easy was so
easy to load we're down to 12 years they
always around and hugs kick butt yeah
something like so so that exists to
already exist so and I think it's done
through NFC right so if it's that's cool
NFC off your phone it basically already
exists and paypass already exists which
I don't know what its branded as there
but when you
credit card knee just wirelessly it so
we're already pretty much there it's
just moving it onto your phone yeah so
we're heading in that direction very
cool stuff um-hmm so no we did lose
about a hundred viewers though that's a
shame oh I guess I shouldn't rap anymore
next topic is here we go hmm connect for
pc and kinect for xbox will be different
now I think I'm gonna let you handle
this because I already knew this because
I talked to them when we were at
computex about it alright go ahead and
talk about this I didn't see anything in
it about this the article that I read
about it was fairly critical yeah well I
would think so yeah but it there could
there could be something with different
functionality there could be something
else going on i'm not really sure but
it's not releasing for a while so kinect
for xbox one for those of you who didn't
catch the headline because we didn't say
it yet will not work on pcs now we saw
the kinect sdk the the kit which
included a connect for pc at computex
but it was old connect not kinect for
xbox i didn't use so this is yet another
example of Microsoft holding back the pc
on purpose Andy why and it's not really
seen for a long time and the dev kits
gonna be four hundred bucks like which
is like someone's gonna hack an xbox one
kinect before they spend four hundred
dollars on a dev kit they're already
hooking yeah Oh to get the new SDK on it
yeah I don't know I'm ER to be able to
do something with it I would think I
think someone will sooner hat hardware
hack an adapter to be able to plug in
the xbox one kinect into a computer or
something or something uh oh of course
hardware hackers may well develop their
own nuts BAM that's uh that I'd like
that's people are gonna try cuz that's
crazy yeah I'm uh I'm I'm I'm pretty
frustrated with Microsoft's general
behavior i mean the kinds of things that
something like connect let's just call
it connect one what is sure connect one
which is
second one I connect one like the kinds
of things that would enable on the pc
things like online shopping being able
virtual fitting room for clothing things
way better than the previous one I mean
things like you know I'm even vr gaming
from like a very basic rudimentary
standpoint the Omni uses it to track
your feet yeah Romney uses it I mean
we're not going to be able to use I mean
and it's a good thing on these working
on there or virtuix is you working on
their own solution for motion tracking
because I boy from it now they can't use
connects will connect anymore apparently
like it's that's ridiculous to me and
like and like the stuff people have
hacked what do we even want to call it
now correct connect original to be able
to do it is very helpful for a lot of
people yeah a lot of disabled people
have been using original connected
interface up there that's the thing that
Microsoft was demoing at computex is
what connect can be used for in like
medical applications yeah oh but they
don't need HDI guys them like what are
you thinking yeah like okay they are
gonna release it that's it's just way in
the future really offensive so anyway uh
moving right along to our next topic
here and him samsung releases their
flawless curved 55-inch TV so let's go
ahead and show you guys this so
basically they're making the same kinds
of claims as LG so that is that a curved
display will give a more natural viewing
experience because your eyes will be an
equal distance from the screen
regardless of which part of the screen
you're looking at um i personally don't
find for something like a 55 inch size
at the distance that I sit from it that
it becomes much of a factor but for
something like a theater obviously it's
a big deal or if I was sitting much
closer to the screen however I mean I
think it's you know it's it's cool and
you're interesting to see how that how
that works out for them and then the
other thing about this monitor is they
are claiming that it is quote unquote
flawless so because of the way that
they've designed it the potential for
defective Oh LED pixels is quote unquote
eliminated so we may be
moving towards and this is really cool
we may be too moving towards a future
where you don't buy a tier 1 display
that has a dead pixel on it yeah I mean
it's awesome that's cool yeah that's
really cool so so there you go it's it's
gonna be priced at 15 million Korean
Juan so about 1,300 us which is not that
outlandish when you consider what guys
were asking for 4k TVs not that long ago
what did Sony want for their look at
what we rent 40 grand I think I was
record I could be wrong but it was huge
it was huge it was like way out of my
price for to be a year early basically
yeah it's like yeah thank you I'll wait
a bit yeah we done good ah hmm okay
let's go look you know what let's do
raise your surround or no no let's do
that at the end uh why don't you do the
torrent freak article ok so the torrent
freak article yeah 18d gets the patent
to monitor and track file-sharing
traffic ok I thought usually put the
other twin I can think of a i can think
of companies that I'd rather have be
patent on that technology than AT&amp;amp;T and
like they haven't talked about whether
or not they've been using it already
because they just have the patent ok
they haven't been like we are going to
deploy it or we have already deployed it
or whatever they're just signing up for
the pend could be already running ok
could be running in the future it like
no one really knows but yeah whether the
company is already using the system to
track in fringing content or has plans
to do so is unknown and if they have
been tracking infringing content they
could all have all that in logs so a lot
of people could be getting in trouble so
in the patent 18t notes that
peer-to-peer traffic amounts for a large
percentage percentage of traffic
generator on the internet some of which
results in a loss for copyright holders
for example some content may be
legitimately purchased and download by
users via p2p however some content may
be pirated an illegally copied and
distributed peated gdp violating
copyright laws etc etc 18t system will
be able to detect what is downloaded on
p2p networks suggesting that this
information can be used to track and
counter piracy
on the verification the list may be
modified etc etc etc the present
disclosure may be used to etcetera etc
etc so guys if it is worth noting it's
worth or it's worth noting rather that
ATT participates in the six strikes
copyright alert system where PDP users
are also monitored the main difference
is that under that program the
monitoring is carried out by the third
party company which only tracks a list
of titles supplied by the mpaa and the
RIAA not a drug everything now they can
just track everything and they can do it
dynamically so they can actually
generate a list of what is being pirated
rather than relying on oasis that is to
monitor yeah so they can use this to
infringe upon you however they would
like and they can use this to throttle
the crap out of your connection if they
feel like it yeah which is do we have
build blogs of the week I don't see them
in the we do but the powerpoints not
ready the powerpoints not ready yeah
because I was doing as we were leaving
into it okay wonderful how do I talk
about razor surround and then we'll wrap
up with those blogs of the week um now
wait a pretty good data NCIX today we
got a lot of cool stuff done yeah so
guys check this out if you've ever
wondered about sort of whether you
should buy a to a stereo headset or a
surround headset the answer for me has
always been if anyone can sort of fill
in the blank for me here let's see
anyone on any one on Twitch something
something something anyone on twitch
blah blah no no no if anyone could okay
I always say guys you got two years
that's how many speakers you need when
the speakers are right next to them
however software surround is a thing so
if you check out the virtual barber shop
tour or whatever it's called on YouTube
and you're wearing headphones it's a
very cool experience it really does feel
like you're you're in an environment and
that can be done in software I mean that
one wasn't done in software if i recall
correctly it was done using a microphone
array but that can be simulated in
software up until now we've relied on
individual headphone manufacturers to
provide that software to us so for
example corsair with the vengeance 2000
headset has dolby headphone technology
that was not in it and then added later
as a software upgrade so if they haven't
change the headset in any way what razor
has decided to do is just sort of go
okay well we're not gonna we're not
gonna sort of worry about any of that
anymore we're just gonna do surround
software surround for every headset so I
haven't tried it yet I just heard about
it the other day and I'm pretty excited
to try it razor surround for child's
play charity has apparently raised
$15,000 to date that's kind of cool
that's awesome johnny was great speaking
of charity linus tech tips for charity
has been down for a couple months we
haven't done a donation but we should
probably do something soon and then i
think we're probably gonna close out
that program because it doesn't seem to
be making any kind of a difference so a
few people are pretty hardcore about it
other than that no one seems to me yep
so I mean it's it's one of those things
where you know yeah we we thought we
were going to kind of do something that
was going to kind of make some kind of a
difference but it was a it was a bit of
a bit of a failure in terms of the
effect that we were hoping that it would
have and how excited people were gonna
get about it so anyway razor surround
and gives gamers the best virtual 7.1
channel surround sound experience with
any stereo headphones and I'm reading
this off their site so I don't actually
know that it's the best I haven't tried
it yet using state-of-the-art technology
the surround sound algorithms powering
razors around creates an unbelievably
accurate surround sound environment and
allows gamers to calibrate positional
sound to match their own unique
preferences I've seen these in software
surround solutions before where you can
actually move around the speakers and
decide exactly where you want the sounds
coming from I think that a lot of
hardcore gamers will still prefer to
have no processing delay on the sound
whatsoever and have this just stereo
sound out of two speakers or even
earbuds because that actually gives you
very strong positional audio as well but
for gamers that are looking for more
like the experience like if you're
playing games like Skyrim as opposed to
counter-strike something like this can
improve immersion I mean when we're
talking surround sound plus Omni plus
oculus for experience type games this is
this is just very very cool and I think
it's really neat that they don't lock it
down to razor headphones yeah so if you
want to use bear dynamics or sennheiser
or even direct
razor competitors like guys like
steelseries or logitech razors kind of
going okay go for it we don't care you
don't have to buy any razor hardware at
all but we've got razer comms now razer
surround I mean synapse I thinks relies
on their hardware but other than that
they've got comms and surround and comms
is quite excellent comms is actually the
software will be using to test our call
in feature in the after party so guys
stick around if you want to try if you
want to see how it works because I don't
think we're gonna allow general public
to call in just yet you done with that
yet hey let's find it you have to find
out if I got usually I save it I know
it's weird but usually I save it to my
download see what they're called Johnny
pillbox friday jun 28 it should be in
the live stream agendas folder live
stream agendas folder that's okay I got
this I got this okay we are on there so
it never really looks that great when we
open it this way but no no offense we're
gonna open it properly because it never
looks that great when we open it this
way wait you said that right good word I
won't have to fire you today I haven't
fired you in a long time nope so this is
a oh this is a wall-mounted home server
can they seem eat anything oh well they
can see you jealous this is a
wall-mounted home server which is
freaking amazing all of these by the way
so this is by user comp LX this is
computer name is VX dash 24 this or
wall-mounted 40 nice Lexia for the win
yay that was awesome if you you should
go check out all of these ones actually
this week especially you should go check
out the actual build because I tried to
get photos that you could see the whole
thing in but there is way better photos
to see specific parts of the build and
to see specific features and to get way
closer that is cool so he actually took
the stickers off the drives just to make
it look more clean yum space age and
futuristic sleeve cables which again you
can't see that great in this but there
is zoomed in shots that look way better
well it looks like it's built into like
a wii balance board or something some i
think he custom made it fan control
they're all the cables i bundled
together nicely at the
autumn here yeah and I believe that the
lights are on the outside can change
like it's it's awesome this build is
very cool we had a ton of we have a
whole bunch of builds that are currently
in progress that are on the way and
these are a few of them that just got
completed which are great awesome this
is another this is another one where you
have to see the other angles of the
system because I picked this one so that
you could see that there is another side
because with a two-sided when you're
supposed to look at it from two
different sides you kind of need to see
different i guess those sleeve cables on
that video card yep Wow like this build
is amazing okay someone's got a pnm and
tell them to remove those cheesy SLI
covers haha I didn't even notice that
bad that's okay I mean I'm not trying to
be critical man but beautiful build you
gotta see the other side as well there's
a big radiator on the back a tubing and
that all that access you right there
that blue water I love this this is
fantastic is this metal construction
what did I checked that I do not know
but it doesn't like it Wow and there's
no way it would what a cool build ok
guys so go check out ZD mods build and
then we see a lot of our force but
you'll know exactly what happened with
this immediately is look at the back so
he pulled out the entire back of the
case to put a triple alphacool radiator
in there doesn't need a graphics card
apparently cuz this is a server build
there you go and what what I couldn't
include in this is the back panel of the
computer because you can see up at the
top there that he has nicely sleeved
cables and if you see the back he has
amazing runs going to his hard drives
huh they look you have to see the
picture like this was 24 pin that's
beautiful the way that its curves away
like that yep and he did a lacing lacing
that looks amazing you got you gotta
check out the billy goddess I see the
back and you got to see his a little
lacing guy that he's yeah very cool
that's very awesome so this this week
was crazy we don't usually do three
builds this week was nuts okay so guys I
think that pretty much wraps it up um
thank you for watching the live stream
and guys stay tuned for the after party
if you want to watch us play video
and sort of yeah that's basically all
you want to do right now and we're gonna
play we're doing is we're gonna test the
call in future oh we're gonna test the
calling feature so you'll basically just
be seeing how it's gonna work for next
week which might be a leg up maybe know
how it works maybe they'll have a chance
to call in maybe um I still yeah I guess
I still haven't gonna be interested to
see how this works but uh yeah it might
just totally not work it did work in our
test it did work in our test so thank
you guys for being awesome and all
tuning in and if you do prefer we won't
be upset if you go and watch the tech
which to my understanding releases
around this time Logan's awesome and we
also won't be upset if you go watch the
star citizen 24 hour stream which is on
right now they're they're doing a big
website overhaul and a 24 hour stream
where they're given some big updates
which we've been missing because we're
here um but yeah so that that's another
options below i'm so stoked on star said
yeah i did you see the the 300 i
cinematic nope Oh week I haven't
actually watched her looked at any you
have to see the cinematic a anyone who's
interested in star citizen recent update
just came out 300 I holy cow it's not
the ship I'm getting no no I don't think
so i think it's the ship i'm getting
constellation 300 I I thought maybe it
is I'm pretty sure that's my ship 300 I
i might be quoting the wrong name as
well oh but i think a few the names are
super similar 300 I
matic I mean we could do this on the
after party we should probably let you
do this on hey thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
