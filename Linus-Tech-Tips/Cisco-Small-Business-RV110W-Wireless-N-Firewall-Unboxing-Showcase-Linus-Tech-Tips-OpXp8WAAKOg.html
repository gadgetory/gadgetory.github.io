that interesting for the home users but
if you work in a small business or if
you own your own small business this
should be pretty relevant so this is the
RV 110 W from Cisco for small business
it offers simple secure connectivity for
small office and home office it enables
faster file transfer using high-speed
wireless technology you know 2 point 1 1
n so all that basically means so far is
it's a router and it's 802.11 n it's a
wireless n router for small business ok
let's keep going you can access files on
your business network securely while
you're away from the office so by using
IPSec tunnels using Cisco quick VPN or
the quick VPN client you can actually
support up to five remote workers using
this particular router so that's kind of
cool you can also allow guests to access
the Internet securely now I've seen the
set ups on some of Cisco routers
including the valet where they show you
how to set up your guest wireless
network it's very intuitive and this one
unlike some business class routers
actually uses an intuitive easy
interface so that's another thing that's
kind of cool here we go let's see what
they have to say for themselves on the
side that's the package contents we'll
get to that when we open the package and
here is a little map of where this fits
in to your network so this is a wireless
n VPN firewall so basically what they're
trying to say is that through the
internet through the VPN tunnel you can
have remote workers that are securely
able to access your work by bypassing
the firewall that is built into the
router that keeps out your malicious
software attacks so that's what this
particular diagram means from here it
can go out to your IP Phone your network
storage your video cameras your wireless
printers wireless laptops whatever else
the case may be it uses fast ethernet
port so you've got a four port hub
that's built in Wireless in for wireless
and let's see what else they've got on
the back here so secure remote access
using IPSec VPN technology okay we
talked about that already and it is IP
six and able to help future-proof your
network easy to install and use this
we've all talked about so far as well in
terms of specifications I actually have
a better sheet than this one so we can
get into that a little bit after let's
get it opened up and find out what you
get with the rv1 10w first you get a
readme first disk next you get a
QuickStart guide in color
and you where to plug things in all
right next you get the wireless firewall
unit itself let's take that guy up we
got too many tenants on there so I'll
show you I'll show you this in detail a
little bit after we get a power adapter
pretty typical standard fare all right
and finally we get a single Ethernet
cable so if you already have a modem
then this will be that additional one
that you'll need in order to connect the
firewall to the modems so let's have a
look at the unit itself okay we've got a
Cisco logo on the front you want to come
in a little bit closer taller yeah okay
we got a Cisco logo on the front power
LED we've got a WPS setup button so
that's really handy to have if you have
other WPS supporting devices internet
LED we've got a wireless LED land LEDs
for the four different ports okay on the
side we've got some ventilation holes as
well as the Kensington lock remember
these are small business skews so these
are not necessarily cheap this guy is in
the mid 100 some odd range so yes it's
an expensive wireless router but it does
have technology built in that is not for
consumers it's for businesses we've got
a reset switch we've got the four ten
hundred fast ethernet ports the one ten
hundred WAN port so this guy is capable
of delivering up to eighty megabit per
second between the when and the LAN
ports so that's the hardware that we
have inside we've also got a power
button as well as our power input and
the two built-in antenna so those are
built in on the other side we find more
ventilation holes on the bottom we've
got the little wall mount Clips as well
as some rubber feet so it doesn't move
around and finally on the top we find a
Cisco logo so this guy compared to
something like it's bigger brother the
RV 220 W which I'll get to after
supports a very basic number of IPSec
connections so only five remote workers
it has less thorough put between the
when and the LAN ports so this guy right
here has a Gigabit LAN port and is
capable of delivering up to 800 megabit
per second whereas this guy is only 80
megabit per second okay and then finally
you don't have support for SSL
tn Thoreau put so and there's also no
cloud-based web protection what you also
do get that you don't get with a
consumer based solution though if you're
just using consumer routers in your
business right now is you get one year
of phone tech support with Cisco and a
three year warranty on it very few
consumers routers are going to come with
that much warranty and that much support
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and overview of the RV 110 W
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for unboxings reviews and other
computer videos
sorry guys one key feature I missed is
that it allows you to create separate
virtual networks so up to four of them
you can divide either your wired or
wireless networks into four zones so
that they can or cannot have access to
each other so that's one way that you
can keep your files secure and then
obviously I did mention the guest Wi-Fi
before that one would not have access to
any of your business files and it would
just be a straight internet connection
for you know someone visiting your
company who wants to sit and get some
work done while they wait or whatever
else the case may be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
