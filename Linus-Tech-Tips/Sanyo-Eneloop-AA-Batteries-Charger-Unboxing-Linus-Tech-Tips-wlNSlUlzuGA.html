famous sanyo eneloop battery so it's
about thirty bucks to buy four batteries
in a charger and doing some very rough
math compared to buying just like some
regular Duracell batteries at the
grocery store which is about four bucks
for four batteries you only need to
charge these Wow if I'm going to be able
to get this up in you only need to
charge them about seven to eight times
to have them start paying for themselves
now
sanyo advertises that they can be
charged as many as a thousand times with
the the statement over 40 billion
single-use batteries were disposed of
worldwide last year isn't it time to go
and charge to go rechargeable so here we
have the the battery charger itself the
manual is glued to the back the
instructions are fairly simple basically
you can charge two or four batteries at
a time I actually own like three of
these chargers and like probably twenty
thirty of these batteries so you either
put them in the one side or you put them
in the other side or you put in all four
now it won't work until you remove the
little plastic strip that's up here
covering the contacts and then you're
ready to go you can actually charge both
double a's and triple a's using this
charger so it's just a little wall plug
right there then we can have a look at
the batteries themselves now one of the
special things about ana loops is that a
they last a really long time compared to
other rechargeable batteries and like i
said i can vouch for that personally and
be they actually come pre charged so if
you just desperately need batteries for
something you can just grab a packet on
the loops throw them in they come with
like a 60% charge or 70% charge use them
for a while then recharge them when you
need to thanks for checking out my blog
on the Sanyo and loop rechargeable
batteries</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
