notebook from a soos and this is the
asou 73 JH a - so it's an Intel Core i7
720 QM processor eight gigs of RAM - 500
gig hard drives and it features an HD
5870 mobile graphics card so that's the
fastest graphics card you can get in a
notebook at this time now just to give
you some idea of the scale of this
notebook it's a really heavy and be
really really big ok so why don't we
just kind of get started here so the
difference between the g2 and the g1 is
just that the g1 has blu-ray as far as I
can tell so I grabbed the g2 since I
don't have any particular use for
blu-ray on the go a moment and let's see
if we can ya see this is why I need a
knife because scissors don't quite cut
it get it cut it yeah okay so the first
thing we find inside the box is an ax
Seuss or oh and no ie taargus backpack
alright so watch out this is a choking
hazard do not put in reach of small
children or dogs alright and I'm going
to go ahead and assume that this
notebook bag fits the notebook in
question so would have to be quite large
to fit a 17 inch notebook but as you can
see it is and I guess I might as well do
my little turn on the catwalk here and
we'll throw the backpack on yeah there
we go so that's what I would look like
if I wore a backpack every day okay
there we go next we have oh man that's
heavy
okay this g series
it's got their Republic of gamers
branding all over it
okay Republic of gamers got the color
scheme going on here not really a whole
lot in terms of anything there so let's
get this box opened up it's not right
ah let's do this first this looks like
an accessory sort of box okay well it'll
come up there goes even that's him wow
this must be like the battery or
something okay we'll turn it up so the
first thing we find in here is a power
cord and then the AC adapter oh wow that
is huge so this is a 1.19 point 5 volt
seven point seven amp AC adapter this
thing has some real heft to it okay next
thing we have is the battery the battery
is actually surprising oh alright
cameraman wants me to do his whole
iPhone for scale thing here here here
okay okay so this is the camera man's
iPhone next to the battery pack and it
doesn't look that big now oh but look at
me now it's huge and it's heavy it's a
lot heavier than an iPhone will tell you
that much okay battery will show you the
size of the battery as well
it's actually not it's surprisingly not
big I'm very shocked at how small the
battery is so put it next to the phone
you can see the width and height of it
it's a very very deep though so I'm
guessing it's like double stacked inside
there or something like that okay now
the next thing we find here is a black
box which includes oh gaming mouse
that's nice so this appears to be based
on um ah shoot I should recognize this
shouldn't I rats okay I don't recognize
the OEM design that this is using but it
looks like a pretty decent little gaming
mouse you got a back and forward button
nice rubberized grip here you've got
your dpi adjustment mouse wheel left and
right click not too bad alright it's
nice of them to include that as part of
the package I mean you're buying an
expensive notebook you might as well
throw in some accessory
for their customers much appreciated a
suit so I could just get this back
inside there okay and then we finally
have a cable tie how very random
actually it's not that random normally a
cable tie would be attached to the power
adapter but it isn't so they provide you
with an extra one okay and then that is
it for accessories we are down to the
notebook Excel fun surprised at the lack
of any documentation inside here there's
there's nothing in terms of instructions
or CDs so I guess the OS is probably on
a on a partition on here and then I'm
guessing all of your drivers are also on
that partition so why don't we just
first of all install the battery so you
can see that it just kind of slides in
right like that and then just locks in
place okay so the batteries in and that
is a pretty sleek looking machine let's
get this box of the way thank you
cameraman and then we'll just kind of
put this down here so it's a matte black
slightly rubberized finish to the back
of it you've got a silver shiny a Seuss
logo on the back as well as their
Republic of gamers shield
okay the hinge design I'll comment on
once I actually get it open but it looks
fairly beefy and solid at the moment on
the back we've got huge ventilation so
you've got a heat sink here and that's
normally about all you would find on a
typical notebook but then over on the
other side past the Kensington lock and
the antenna hole you've got another huge
ventilation hole alright let's go around
to this side where we will find power in
VGA HDMI out so you can do both analog
or digital out then you've got a couple
of USB ports as well as an SD card slot
around the front you've just got
indicator lights so you got your
wireless hard drive battery and a light
bulb and then you have Gigabit LAN
another USB port DVD multi or in the
case of the of the other version of this
laptop you would have a blu-ray drive
USB mic in and headphone out let's go
around to the bottom here so you can see
the bottom is where all of that
oh okay where all of that air is going
to be coming from so these there are
probably blower fans right around here
and then they're sucking air into these
vents and then out the back of the unit
is my assumption either that or one of
them is an intake and one of them is an
exhaust I have no way of knowing without
opening it and I don't particularly want
to do that though so anyway there's the
bottom you can see you've got easy
access for upgrades to what appears to
be the RAM here and probably wireless
hard drive and all of that good stuff so
let's flip this back over and now I've
gotten it all dirty oh well there we go
okay so we'll open up the front okay
there's no law there's no unlock or
anything like that you just kind of lift
it it's heavy enough I doubt it's going
to come out on its own okay we'll remove
the little lastly okay so the first
thing we see inside is obviously the 17
inch widescreen LCD and here's a little
bit of information at a soos includes
about this notebook so you've got a
two-year global warranty that means that
if you buy it in Canada and take it to
Europe you're still covered by your soos
warranty you've got a zero brite
guarantee so a bright dot is kind of
like a dead pixel except it's um like a
colourful spot then you've got to a free
standard shipping for your RMA and 24/7
technical support that's pretty darn
good for a standard warranty and they
even include no way they include the
Asuza accidental damage warranty so you
have a one year covering accidental drop
spills power surges and fire damage go
figure
all right so here let's have a look at
that let's see if the battery came
charged
wouldn't that be lucky so you got a
couple of speakers here that's gonna
take care of your sound and then there's
also a subwoofer grill that we saw on
the bottom of the unit already that's
okay we already saw that and then so
let's have a look at the screen itself
I'll just kind of angle it so you can
have a look here you've got a webcam up
at the top a little glossy thing around
there okay we're starting up windows why
don't we have a look at the keyboard
because keyboard is such a big thing for
for any notebook you can see this is
quite a comfortable full-size keyboard
and it's using chiclet keys which are
very popular although they're not my
personal favorite
a sous gives you a little outline of the
specs of this again so they've got the
i7 720 is 58 70 with one gig of video
RAM which I hadn't covered already 17.3
inch screen it includes wireless n as
well as yeah that's pretty much
everything that we already talked about
and they oh they have these labeled look
they're both exhausts so there you go so
the air intake is actually at the bottom
okay and then we've got more badges over
here so your core i7 badge windows 7 is
included obviously HD 5870 graphics as
well as a creative EAX and then oh here
we go
so it's booted up already we can check
the english-language cameraman is
indicating something to me oh I like
this look at this touchpad this is an
enormous touchpad that's a huge
advantage for this laptop because if you
have a nice big high-res screen the last
thing you want is to have a little tiny
touchpad that you're going to the edge
and then going back tracking like that
so keypads comfortable um that's pretty
comfortable too actually this whole
thing is a pretty good experience
actually cameraman if you wanna have a
look at the screen you can see it there
but I think that pretty much covers
everything that I have to say about this
particular notebook thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the g73
series a sous gaming notebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
