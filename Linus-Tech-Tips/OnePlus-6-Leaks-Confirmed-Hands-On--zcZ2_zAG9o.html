have me travel as much as possible to
get my hands on the new one plus six
oneplus has sponsored my trip all the
way to London England and this launch is
actually really special for me because
while I've never seen a mass production
unit before
I've already been behind the scenes for
a look at the very impressive
development and manufacturing process so
I am really excited to see just how it's
turned out
there's a limit to how much I can tell
you guys today
pesky embargoes right so I'm gonna work
my way through the most burning
questions first starting with the price
oneplus has been increasing their MSRP
generation by generation citing
increased development costs and product
complexity and it looks like the six
gigs of ram 64 gig rom model is going to
be about 30 US dollars more expensive
than the 1 + 5 t that it replaces now
the good news is that still $200 less
than a galaxy s 9 or $300 less than an S
9 plus and you're getting some pretty
nice upgrades starting with the display
so it's six point two eight inches
diagonally with a super tall nineteen by
nine aspect ratio and like the 1 + 5 + 1
+ 5 T before it it uses an AMOLED panel
for perfect blacks and DCI p3 color
space support it's got rounded corners
and it's got the highly-controversial
notch in the top but honestly I'm not
even mad anymore now that I've heard
that one plus is planning to allow users
to disable the knotch outright if they
don't want an ugly cutout in their ultra
wide videos like the ridiculous
situation on the iPhone 10 what's not
ridiculous about this phone is how few
dongles I'll be carrying so it still
drives me nuts that razor went out and
released a gaming phone that requires a
dongle for Wired headphones not so here
you can charge the 3300 milliamp hour
battery and listen to music or play
games on the bus to your heart's content
now under the hood we're getting a
snapdragon 845 processor 6 or 8 gigs of
low power ddr4 X Ram and anywhere from
64 gigs to 256 gigs of internal storage
in a variety of colors I think this is
actually the most launch cues that we
have ever seen from oneplus and the
material is the most exotic that we've
seen from them as well basically every
surface of this phone
front and back is made of Corning
Gorilla Glass five and I know what you
guys are thinking but I have actually
seen these phones go through shocking
like literally shock testing shocking
durability tests and survived including
up to a 2 meter fall on one of the
prototypes in the lab so I've got no
concerns about the durability of this
approach and it makes for a very
striking looking and smooth curvy
feeling phone I really like the way it
sits in my hand
especially the matte version which is
still made of glass but it's got a
special surface treatment on it that
makes it a little bit less slippery
another thing that's pretty stunning
about it is how much bigger the screen
has gotten compared to the 1 + 5 from
just a year ago at nearly the same size
for the frame and a similar wait another
thing one plus is that it is just your
control if you're into the complete full
screen experience so it's drag up for
home then drag up and hold for multitask
and if you're already in an app like say
for example a web browser
you just drag up from the bottom to go
back shoot shoot
and it works on both the right and left
side now I can't unfortunately show you
any test shots but I have been enjoying
playing around with the camera oneplus
has doubled down on their F 1.7 16
megapixel primary and 20 megapixel
secondary shooter approach but they've
thrown a couple of new tricks into the
mix here including a larger primary
sensor so this is intended to help with
low-light performance and then they've
also got an a I assisted portrait mode
that is going to be coming a little bit
after launch so it's hard to say at this
time
what if anything has changed about the
selfie camera but their lightning-fast
face on lock which does depend on the
selfie camera is back so thanks for
watching guys
thanks to oneplus for sponsoring me out
here for a first look at the one plus
six let me know what you guys would like
to see followed up on in the full review
