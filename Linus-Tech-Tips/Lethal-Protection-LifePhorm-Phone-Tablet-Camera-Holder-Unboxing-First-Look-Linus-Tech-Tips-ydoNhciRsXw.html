today we've got the life-form pho RM and
we've also got a very different setup so
here's here's something like crazy going
on right now so we have a b roll camera
we're going to switch to that right now
c b roll camera for close-ups let's have
a close look at the box of the life form
so the life form is trying to replace
any smartphone tablet or camera holder
that you have already and just do
whatever that does and better so i'll
give you a couple examples of the sorts
of products that we're trying to replace
here so here's a tablet stand this is
actually a pretty good tablet stand you
can rotate it into portrait or landscape
mode you can rotate blue okay see it
falls out if you do that but that's not
really the recommended way to use it
that that is right there and then it
also seeks to replace stuff like this so
here is sort of one of those portable
tripods that you can throw your camera
on and you can easily take a picture you
can't do things like sort of portrait
shots or anything like that you can't
clip it to things so the life-form tries
to be a pretty unique approach to this
and that it here i'm just going to open
up the box now it's anything and it's
extremely flexible so inside the box you
find only a couple things you got a
manual here that shows you how to mount
smartphones tablets cameras as well as
just gives you sort of a index of all
the different stuff that should be
inside the box you got a piece of foam
over the top and then you've got the
life-form itself so you just pop that
out there and it's a pretty neat little
device so here's where you would mount
so let the start it comes with the with
the phone mount obviously as you can see
and it's got six legs so these six legs
are made of plastic but they're kind of
a reinforced plastic they do feel quite
strong the joints are tight and they are
adjustable so you can see they've all
got screws on them so if they get too
loose or if you feel like they're too
tight you can adjust them so that they
have as much stickiness as you want
remember you want it to be a little
sticky because you want to put these in
place and you want them to to stay there
they bend in three different places so
they all bend here tell you like that
they all have one joint right up at
very top and then they all have a second
joint a little bit further away kind of
like kind of like a hand and then at the
end in order to grab onto things there's
these little rubberized hooks that are
not going to damage anything but they
should allow it to kind of clamp onto
stuff so some of the examples that the
manufacturer gives are you know clipping
it to a tree to take a portrait picture
with your camera hanging it to the edge
of a ramp on a skate park so you can get
like cool footage of yourself going over
this i'm not sure if i'd recommend but
that's on the windscreen of a boat and a
bike I treadmills probably fine and then
they've got a couple more examples here
including the back of a headrest and
then a pregnant woman's belly actually I
think it's a pillow and I don't think
she's pregnant but ha ha ha ha very
funny right so I want to show you guys
all three different mounting mechanisms
because they're kind of clever so
there's two nuts at the back one of them
is a metal one so this one you have to
be you have to kind of really go at it
with your fingers and it's a little bit
tough and then the other one's a plastic
ones so the plastic one loosens the
sliding mount so that's how you're going
to expand it to the maximum which will
allow you to mount let's see can I get
an iphone in there note we're going to
want to do an iphone this way so you
allows you to mount sort of a smartphone
so then all you do is you put this back
into place like that make it nice and
tight so it's not going anywhere and
then you can do crazy things like here
I'm going to go around the front of the
table and clip it to the front of the
table and that's not gonna go anywhere
in theory so you can take these ones and
you can bring okay you know what let's
clip it to something more interesting
let's clip it to the cat tree so this is
sort of like their tree example where
you just take all these legs and you
grab it on to their or you can hang it
off the edge of something just sort of
neat just kind of go like this and then
try to clamp it up there there you go so
if you want to put it on your your
homemade whoops there we go cat tree
then that would also work go grab around
the back actually it's kind of kind of
neat so once you get it positioned
correctly it's it's not bad at all so I
want to give you guys another close-up
of the of the the rubberized grip e
parts here so that you can get some idea
of whether your stuffs going to get
damaged or not so you can see there's
actually like
a super soft super sticky grip all
inside the insides of these hooks as
well as on the back here so you don't
have to worry about your fragile
electronics getting damaged so this guy
right here allows us to take the screw
out completely and then what we can do
is we can go ahead and open the whole
thing up in order to get compatibility
for larger devices such as tablets all
you got to do is take it throw it back
on to the life-form claw screw the metal
screw back in first until it goes all
the way and you can tell it has a bit of
a it has a bit of a feel to it like you
well you feel it sort of okay then you
throw your tablet into the clamps and
then tighten them up which is easy as
long as you don't accidentally do up the
plastic one all the way okay and then
you tighten up the plastic nut so now
that you've done that your tablet is
mounted to the life form so you can go
ahead and like I said easy replacement
for something like this because you are
now ready to mount your tablet and you
know watch a little movie or do whatever
it is you want to do you can also easily
adjust it so that you can sit it sort of
the other way or whatever else you can
rotate it actually it's probably easier
to just rotate the tablet that's what
whatever okay the point is it's flexible
the point is you can take it now you can
clip it onto the back of something and
it's not really going to go anywhere
last thing that you can mount to it with
these is a camera so we're going to
replace that tripod e-mount thing that
we got going on there for this you take
off there we go you take this off
completely and then this is threaded
correctly for the bottom of a camera so
that's not going to work yet until I
actually had a camera to put on it so
this is a pretty standard pretty
standard mount that you'll find on any
sort of half decent camera so you just
put that through there put that into the
bottom of the camera and now you are
ready to do sort of crazy things with
your camera like mount it wherever it is
you want it to go so yeah let's let's go
back to sort of their example is it
actually good enough to do this so let's
see if the picture on the on the box is
just
outright deceptive or if this can
actually work cannot do that yeah look
at that there you go you can like zoom
in and stuff should you so desire see
very neat actually I think that pretty
much wraps it up thank you for checking
out this unboxing and first look at the
life form amount for tablets smart
phones and cameras don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and since we have our fancy b
roll camera i'm going to get our
cameraman to come in here and take like
a nice sort of like spinning shot of our
lazy susan which is also a new addition
to our set and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
