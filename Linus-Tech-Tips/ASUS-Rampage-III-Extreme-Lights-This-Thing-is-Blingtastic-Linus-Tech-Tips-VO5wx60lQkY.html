video showing the rampage three extreme
with all of its lights and stuff
so I thought that was not a terribly bad
idea so I'm just gonna actually that's
probably one more cable I should plug in
here just in case I end up needing it
plug in the pin so basically even when
the board is off you still got the
Republic of gamers logo which will light
up
oh shoot I wish you could see that it's
so bright in here Luke can you turn the
light off I don't think you can okay so
can you see that at all there you go
okay there so it has like a pulsating
red glow to it and then your start and
reset switches are also illuminated so
you could see them in the dark if you
were you know testing on a on a bench
like extreme benching session late at
night in the dark although I don't
really recommend that okay so then we're
gonna go ahead and press the button so
here's some of the other lights myself
and again okay so you see it does a
quick test CPU RAM and then it's
probably gonna test finish testing
around yeah then it moves on to VGA and
then we get a beep code because there is
no video card installed so that's one of
the cool features that this board has
and then other than that I don't think
we have too many other indicate oh yeah
no here's another cool one this is a
good one right there you can see that
the DDR is green so it is labeled
underneath I don't know if you can read
it or not but it says DDR normal and
then if I and then crazy so that that
LED will actually move up as you have
your your RAM voltage higher and higher
so that's a pretty cool little feature
then this one is self bridge normal high
crazy then there is a North Bridge or
CPU indicator over here so that'll show
you how high your CPU voltage is with a
little color-coded meter and then
there's probably one for the North
Bridge somewhere yeah here it is North
Bridge is right there so that's a pretty
cool little feature on this board that's
also to do with all the lights and then
whoa what's this for BIOS one LED and
then is there a BIOS two LED oh cool
so it shows you which of the okay
because this is a feature of this board
that's really neat you can actually load
two separate BIOS profiles and then boot
from whichever BIOS you want so maybe I
have BIOS one set to my 24/7 overclock
and then I use BIOS to for any like
extreme testing that I want to do that
way I don't have to tinker with any of
my regular everyday settings so this led
right here turns on when you're using
BIOS chip 1 and this led over here turns
on when you're using BIOS chip - that's
pretty cool - so that concludes my
overview of the LED lights that are
included with the rampage 3 extreme oh
yeah this one doesn't pulsate when the
system is actually on now I touch the
fan again it just cares I just want to
do this - you can see how red it was
yeah see it glows really good now thanks
