now to learn more welcome to an unboxing
of a fairly eclectic set of products
here these are from banggood.com which
is not as bad as it sounds so you can
safely go there however it should be
noted that the name isn't entirely
misleading because they do sell intimate
apparel and sex toys and all those kinds
of things but that is not don't worry no
no don't have to get away from the video
yet that is not what we're going to be
talking about we're going to be looking
at a few of the different things so they
have kind of weird electronics they also
have some keyboards okay so like some
gaming gear and stuff and other just
completely random stuff so of course
you'll have been led here by the
thumbnail of me with like boxes in like
oh I got a worth it on and anyway they
actually contacted me about taking a
look at some keyboards and I was like
although um can you send me a horse head
as well and they're like alright yeah I
guess anyway let's start with the flash
get g600 keyboard so this is just one of
the keyboards that they have I picked
out this one because I thought it was
kind of unique compared to what we can
typically get our hands on here in North
America so it's not the highest end
keyboard by any stretch of the
imagination so it does not unfortunately
have backlit keys but what it does have
is an aluminum backplate so it actually
feels extremely solid so here if you
guys check out my flex test I mean
obviously there's almost none even with
me wrenching on the keyboard which is
what you've come to know you'll come to
expect from an aluminum built keyboard
it also has a very unique color to the
key cap so they're translucent red G
caps with that said that they do have
printing right on the top so I wouldn't
expect the numbers and letters to last
as long as some of the other
technologies that are available for
printing key caps this particular one
has a 10 keyless design although there
are a number of other unique keyboards
that they have available there so
there's rubber feet on the bottom this I
like to see this
rubber feet implementation on the risers
at the back that allows it to still stay
attached securely to the table whether
they're in the down or up position it's
got a removable cord so you can actually
decide how exactly you want that cable
managed whether you want it coming
directly out of the back of the keyboard
or if you want it to go somewhere else
all you got to do is plug this in and
then it has a little piece right here
that sits wherever you might happen to
want it to come out so I'm just go like
that and that'll lock it in place real
nice just like that my friends all right
so now is where we get into the next
selling point of this particular
keyboard not is the fact that it comes
with a full set of replacement key caps
which is this is the first time I've
seen this again it's sort of those
differences between the different
markets where who knows in Asia maybe
this is a common thing that you get a
full set of black key caps with your
silver and red keyboard maybe it isn't a
common thing I have no idea what I do
know is that it has built-in media
controls and other than that not a whole
lot of extra functionality like
programmable macros or anything like
that but there you have it we can
completely replace these if we so
desired
let's go like that unfortunately oh look
at that it doesn't include a key cap
puller well hopefully if you're a
keyboard dork like me you already have a
key cap puller but oh yeah I guess
another idea is you could you can make
like a Canadian keyboard and like put a
bunch a little bit of black accents and
get a red and white thing going on
anyway next up so they do have some
other sort of weird cool electronics so
this is the W 100 sq R series this was
actually one of the other things that
they actually wanted me to talk about
and this one can be controlled the
reason I picked this one is because it
can be controlled with a supported
device so I believe yep so there's an
app available on the App Store so I'll
show it off with the iPad but it is also
compatible with spectrum based radios so
I have a spectrum crap what is it dx6i
or something along those lines to dxn
something something like that anyway I
have the spectrum radio so I've never
actually flown a quadrocopter other than
the ar.drone so I've certainly never
flown one with a radio I've always are
with a transmitter I've always used
adlet our smartphones I just kind of
wanted to try it out so I said yeah sure
I'll have a look at this one so it
supports iPhone iPad products with the
required with the Wi-Fi module supports
okay yeah yeah oh yeah it has a built-in
camera with a first person view
functionality so let's go ahead and pop
it open so obviously it's no ar.drone
but what it does have going for it is
that it is smaller and lower cost and of
course due to its smaller nature it has
less momentum when it crashes so I would
expect it to do reasonably well in
crashes with nice flexible propellers as
well as this is actually kind of smart
color-coded front and back propellers
this is going to allow you to clearly
and easily orient yourself against sort
of where the device is probably pointed
when you're under it or looking at it
from far away so you'll know which way
is forward and which way is back it
charges using I have no idea because I
haven't gotten that far yet this is the
first time I've taken it out of the box
and I'm not making any progress while I
sit here and try to stall for time and
we figured it out so there's a little
panel in the top here on the bottom
rather that just pops out like this well
whatever it's popped out now so don't
worry too much about it here's the
antenna for the receiver and then also
in here we find a battery 3.7 volts 600
million power battery that slots into
here when you're running and then an
included charger for said battery
alright and finally whatever the devil
this is bind plug oh okay
and then also full instructions include
and look about a user's manual on disk
so much like other Wi-Fi enabled remote
control devices you connect to the Wi-Fi
hotspot that is actually created by the
quadrocopter so in this case it was wk
zero nine seven one zero one zero eight
then you can launch the app
all right so we got the we got the
aircraft put together with some helpful
googling we were able to figure out that
it's the wk Remote app because it
doesn't say anywhere on the packaging or
anything it should be noted that I got a
little bit confused by some of the
documentation because there are two
separate versions one is the Wi-Fi
version which you can only fly with an
iOS device the other is the fpv advanced
control version so I don't think without
changing over the module I can actually
fly this with the spectrum remote like I
was hoping to so there you go the camera
in the front is actually better than I
expected so there's a pinhole camera
right there and I've got the app open
right here so you guys can have a look
at approximately what it looks like so
yeah it's it's only an iPhone version of
the app so you have to run in 2x mode
here what gets b-roll but yeah let's go
ahead and let's take it outside and go
for test flight well let's see if I can
handle this you can apparently either
use gyroscopic control or joystick
control so well apparently that's not it
okay so takeoff is here nope er Barbie
my throttle hmm fascinating do I need
the power button perhaps heard something
over there
okay oh there it goes alrighty then okay
let's set her down for a second okay
took a little while to to connect there
evidently okay so this guy right here is
there we go gonna be throttle let's go
up a little bit shall we let's go a
little bit of whoo oh hey okay so I've
got the OBE so I've got the gyroscopic
control going on now which is going to
make this a lot easier to fly however
you're still going to want to be careful
with the throttle there because unlike
the AR Drone this does not have height
adjust so you get a you got to find your
own neutral point when it comes to
lifting off or coming back down and it
can pretty much go as high as it can go
I can tell you already that the AO the
white and orange propellers are
definitely important for orienting this
device
visually so let's go ahead let's have a
look at what kind of speed we can get
out of it
so there's forward there's back oh
please come down not that fast you got
this you got this buddy okay
let's go visit b-roll hey oh okay we're
not going to quite quite visit him that
close whoa
please don't crash oh okay huh pretty
intuitive pretty uh interesting to fly
whoa no I imagine it would take me a
little while to get the hang of it but
there you have it guys I don't know why
don't we crash it and see if we can
break it I mean that's what you guys pay
me good money to do right break things
come on buddy you can do it so there is
a power button so you do have to
actually power the quadrocopter on in
order to get it to go I wonder if I
managed to break it already
oh well that flipped the orientation of
the thing here so quick reset and we're
back in action still using the
gyroscopic control so let's go ahead and
I don't know let's give her about a
ten-foot fall and see what happens cut
the power Oh didn't cut the power good
enough okay let's try that again
oh I flipped the orientation again so
power onto the device and boom go go
lift oh and oh don't go to the
neighbor's yard cut the power all right
not bad it manages to stay upright so I
think that pretty much wraps it up thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
overview of the well variety of things
