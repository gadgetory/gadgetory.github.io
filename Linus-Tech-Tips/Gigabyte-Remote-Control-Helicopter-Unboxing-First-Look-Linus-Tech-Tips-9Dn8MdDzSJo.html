I have ever received from anyone this
one is from the heck they're from
gigabyte yes gigabyte has partnered up
with cyma radio-controlled product knew
something something metal series three
channels infrared RC mini helicopter yes
using a gyroscopes s107 your own space
in the sky special indoor design
adjustable trim control rechargeable
lipo battery and 3-way precision
controller design technology interface
gigabyte has delivered an RC helicopter
to me so I told crazy Russian because he
wanted to go do work or something like
that that if he sticks around that helps
me with these unboxings today that he
can have vs 107 G alloy infrared remote
control helicopter you can see right
here is a balance bar a main blade and
they main blade that is to say there are
two main blades but I'm okay that's my
line
we have a tail blade landing gear a
charging socket a power switch charging
wire and and infrared remote control so
remember kids infrared means that you
must have a line of sight oh it takes
six double-a batteries so yeah you're
gonna want to go ahead and have like
lots of batteries on hand for this you
can hover up and down you can turn
counterclockwise and clockwise you can
go forward and you can go backwards if
the helicopter rotates a whilst in
operation a while so that is even the
correct use of whilst I am very
impressed please use the rudder trim to
adjust it has trimming everything like
that
alright spare parts list yeah right I
mean if you're actually gonna like buy
spare parts for this thing you might
involve it just buy a new one probably
wow it's actually made of metal that
seems like nugget I'm a little porn on
this hole made of metal thing with this
because like made of metal gives it a
like a higher quality sort of feel but
the disadvantage to being made of
is that it is heavier which is going to
affect performance negatively and
potentially battery life negatively and
the parts of the helicopter that are
most likely to break so where metal
would provide the biggest improvement to
durability are the blades and those are
made of plastic so you know yeah
yeah I don't know yeah sorry you're
having a little bit of trouble here guys
getting these like hardcore twist eyes
look at these these they're basically
like paper clips getting these out it's
making me feel like not an experienced
time boxer here crazy bastard was
commenting to me I'm getting up near the
1000 video milestone which is a lot of
videos on the tube 1000g give you I have
way more than 1000 jigaboos actually no
I don't although it's Jigga that's a
billion yeah I don't have 1000 GB fees
alright so there we are this actually
looks pretty slick doesn't it so there's
your charging jack right there so what
you do is it works like all of those
little cheap airplanes and helicopters
in that you open up this right here you
pull out the little charging cable once
you've put in the six double-a batteries
which inexplicably requires a
screwdriver to put in and out like why
it's like extra work for no apparent
reason I remember when I was a kid like
when I was like 10
cuz like most people don't just carry a
screwdriver it's like oh I'm at the
store I bought this cool thing and I
bought some batteries let me just pull
screwdriver on my back pocket so anyway
you need a screwdriver in order to
install the batteries up here we have
nothing and here's the infrared wow
those are super aligned you can see this
is a very high quality construction here
there's not an off switch channel
selectable so based on whichever channel
your chopper is
I guess just trial and error just try
things and then find out which channel
it's using and select that on your
controller okay ah there's your up and
down control there is your forward back
right and left this is actually very
advanced for one of these like cheapo
helicopters and you know what the build
quality for all of my griping about the
controller actually looks pretty decent
so you can see that it uses rotating
blades like hold on yeah obviously
rotating blades herp derp but it uses
blades that are mounted on little hinges
here so what that means is that if
you're all like and you hit something
like the edge of a table the chances of
them breaking are dramatically reduced I
actually have a helicopter at home that
uses a similar blade style and I've hit
it on all kinds of things my catsuit
like knocked it out of the air and you
had it stuck in the three once I have it
no no that was my plane okay here is the
back propeller this one's probably
pretty likely to break but you know what
are you gonna do um so yeah I guess
that's pretty much all there is to say
about it so crazy Russian hopefully will
allow me to oh no way okay hold on all
right I don't have batteries in the
controller so crazy Russian will
hopefully let us do some some footage of
this flying once he's I got it all set
up and thank you for checking out this
unboxing on - tech tips I'm just trying
to see how big the battery is if I can
see how many milli gigawatts it is
milliamps in the amp hours whatever that
unit is okay don't forget to subscribe
to honest tech tips from unboxings
reviews and don't forget to get to the
choppa I didn't even notice this check
this up it comes with a USB charging
cable for the chopper itself so those
six double-a batteries are gonna last
you like 300 billion years if all
they're doing is operating the infrared
emitter also it comes with a extra
propeller blade for the secondary prop
in the back very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
