to make their edge browser happen an
uphill battle given Internet Explorer's
reputation among consumers and I would
say bet alongside the
strategically-placed and I'm going to
say this
snarky prompts that Windows 10 is always
dishing out for you to make edge your
default browser the juiciest peach that
Microsoft has to entice users to jump
ship is their claim that edge offers
better battery life than any other
browser but does it in this episode of
manufacturers say we explore the current
state of browser battery life and
determine if Microsoft's claims
constitute an epic mic drop or an epic
ball drop
I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
gaming laptops featured until seventh
generation core i7 processors check them
out at the link below for our tests we
used four brand-new identical inspiring
1575 59 s loaned to us by Dell thanks
Dell so from the moment these landed in
our office careful attention was paid to
keep them as similar to one another as
possible if steam was installed in one
machine it had to be installed on the
other three as well
so one thing we needed to know was with
manufacturing tolerances in mind just
how identical are these machines if we
had a lemon we needed to know about it
so we ran PC markets home conventional
battery test on each laptop twice and
although there is some variability in
the test results we consider all of them
to be within the margin of error that
we've come to expect from PC mark and no
machine was consistently better or worse
than any of the others across the two
tests next we had to control our testing
conditions if one of the machines
decides to update its bloatware value
added pre-installed software thanks Dell
halfway through an overnight run that's
just too much pee in the punchbowl for
that machine's results to be meaningful
so we uninstalled everything with Dell
in the name iced McAfee blacked out
GeForce experience locked down windows
privacy and politely asked Cortana to
reenact her death scene at the end of
Halo 4 then having run out of puns we
disabled telemetry set the brightness to
50% and set the system volume to 15%
with our machines sufficiently sanitized
we were ready to move on from synthetic
tests to real-life loads
starting with edge running on all four
machines once again to
sure consistency so we designed our
real-world tests to reflect actual
internet browsing some social a - of
news a sprinkle of autosave and a 6-hour
stream of the fork a Yule Log
pretty typical stuff for this time of
year and wait what on the very first
test we had machines dying up to an hour
and a half earlier than the others even
though they're all the same laptop
running in identical environments with
the same browser so we did the same test
two more times and got similar results
what gives in order to find out if the
inconsistencies were due to the browser
or due to the machines we would end up
needing a lot more tests so we
downloaded Chrome Firefox and opera on
each machine and ran tests after tests
rotating the browsers across the
machines and as for the results well
there do seem to be some differences
between units 1 2 4 with machine 3
toeing the border of dud territory but
that's far from the whole story when we
ran Chrome or opera on all four machines
they died within 20 minutes of each
other and if we compare the best and
worst times of individual browsers
across multiple tests on the same
machine we see that edge just has the
biggest range between its lap times but
hold on Linus Microsoft never claimed to
have the most consistent battery life
they claimed to have the best battery
life it's a tortoise and a hare thing
well no you hold on because we're just
getting started
not only did edge not trounce the
competition in our tests it didn't even
get the high score chrome did well hold
on again Linus because edge just got a
huge battery life boost with the recent
Windows creators update and you
I didn't even use the same testing
methodology that Microsoft did when they
made these claims to begin with you know
what you hold on even harder because
this project took freaking forever and
we actually did tests before and after
the creator's update and although IDI
performed very well and not to mention
much more consistently after the update
it still didn't break our longest life
record and besides since Microsoft's
testing methodology is public well Rick
recreated that one too and Ed's still
got beat who got to calm down here its
conclusion time so prior to the
creator's update edge had big winners
and big losers but since then it's
closer to the consistently good
performance that we observed from chrome
opera is also a good choice and it even
has a battery saver mode but well didn't
improve our life in our tests but did
improve consistency and as for Firefox
well it's probably not your best bet if
battery life is your number one priority
so bottom line at the time of writing
edge no longer has well an edge when it
comes to battery life but Microsoft
certainly deserves props for stimulating
healthy competition that benefits us all
except that is safari people everyone
knows they should be using a VPN to
enhance their privacy online and if you
didn't know that well now you do but
it's so confusing there's so many
options so just use title bear we make
it simple you download tunnel bear you
hit like one button and boom your
connection is secured and your online
activity is kept private from your
internet provider advertisers and anyone
looking to track you or profit from your
data tunnel bear has a top rated privacy
policy and does not log your activity so
don't take my word for it try it for
free with five hundred Meg's and no
credit card required and when you decide
to get a year of
on limited data which is a lot more
affordable than you'd probably think
save 10% by going to tunnel bear comm /l
tt we've got that linked below so thanks
for watching guys is this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit the like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured at Amazon in
the video description also down there is
our merch store which has cool shirts
like this one and our community forum
which you should totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
