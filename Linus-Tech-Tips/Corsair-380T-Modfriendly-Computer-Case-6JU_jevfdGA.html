purchase of a qualifying Intel processor
SSD or nook you could instantly win and
Intel gaming Jersey and be entered in
the draw for the ultimate system click
now to learn more the 380 comes in a
great soft packing foam but I do find a
little bit funny that the box for the
case that has a handle has no handles on
it not that it's even really that
important because overall it's pretty
light I just kind of thought that was
funny starting at the top we have the
handle itself which at first glance
looks fantastic but upon further
inspection a was a little bit put off by
the fact that I can't properly grip it
due to my large hands and in this case
specifically large knuckles to be fair
there are ways that I can carry it but
grasping the handle by my fingertips or
have my hand go in at an angle is not
really ideal when I try to grab it
properly my knuckle ends up digging into
the plastic housing and it's kind of
highly uncomfortable especially when you
get some of the weight of a completely
built system on the inside it's kind of
a lot not being said I had Linus try it
and he loved it the sizing was perfect
for his tiny little hands resulting in
no issues on that front because of this
I'll have Linus do the over test this
time around as a little bit worried
about my auger test resulting in either
the case smashing into the ground or a
bruised knuckle for me also on the top
we have the i/o panel you'll find power
reset and fan control buttons alongside
dual USB 3.0 ports and dual audio jacks
due to the positioning and style of the
start button
I was actually reminded of a push to
start button for a car which we're
looking at industrial design at least in
my opinion that's a big compliment
proceeding onwards we have the actual
front of the unit which hoses a massive
fan grille and filter which is very
easily removed and it will reveal a 140
millimeter fan if you desire you can
swap this 140 millimeter fan out for
either dual 120 millimeter fans or a 200
millimeter fan will provide a great deal
of airflow to the unit both the side
panels are identical and interchangeable
go wing if it was kind
flipped upside-down esque doors which in
my opinion are super freakin cool these
doors similar to the front of the case
are essentially just giant fangirls with
filters and yet again it will afford
your case a great deal of airflow
another thing to note is that these
grilles are all a honeycomb cut so those
of you that wanted this case because
when you get it in yellow it roughly
resembles a bee there's something else
for you as well just above the fangirls
we see both the handles for the doors
and their little tiny windows which I at
first thought were kinda useless and if
you install a 240 millimeter radiator
when you have the chance on the right
side window it will pretty much just see
the radiator and radiators fans but the
left side window will give you a nice
view of your graphics card and it will
reel a little bit of your motherboard as
well so that will be quite nice actually
once we get to the back there isn't
really a ton going on except for the
placement of a 120 millimeter fan so
we're just going to move on to the
bottom upon arrival we are greeted by
dual case feet which unlike the BitFenix
prodigy z' case feet are actually quite
strong and secure even when the case is
filled and has some weight in it another
thing you'll notice is the removable fan
filter for your power supply which goes
very flush against the case to the point
where I didn't even notice until I flip
the case over a nice touch before we
proceed inside I must call to attention
something great there's been a train
I've been seeing lately which I hope is
here to stay this trend is to have a
great deal of your case panels removable
allowing a modder to strip down the case
most of the way by using screws instead
of removing rivets the Corsair 3 IDT did
not shy away from this trend instead I
decided to champion for it you can
fairly easily strip down the entire case
to its small bare metal housing and in
some cases removing the panel's even
reveals some extra features for instance
if you remove the top which is
essentially just the handle you're
greeted with some cable management
options for the front IO cables not
something I expect a ton of people to
notice or even find but it's pretty
freakin cool that they even included it
finally we go inside in the bottom
you'll find a dual two and a half inch
drive cage which uses a squeeze mount
system to keep everything in place due
to how loosely the system holds the
drives in place I wouldn't feel all that
comfortable installing it two and a half
inch hard drive in there but an SSD
which is what I expect to be installed
in there by
people will be totally fine behind that
cage you find a mounting area for the
power supply install the year I have an
elegantly named Silverstone stat5 F - G
s my reasoning for this is because it is
the world's smallest fully modular ATX
power supply and it fits perfectly but
wasn't my first choice the first choice
was the RM 850 from Corsair I mean it
makes sense it's yellow unfortunately
though it's too long Corsair does have a
solution allowing you to remove the dual
three and a half inch hard drive cage
which by the way is easy to install
dries in - due to its bendable tray
system but I wanted to install drives
here so that wasn't exactly an option
for me I would have liked to see Corsair
have a solution for removing the hard
drive cage elsewhere instead of removing
it completely or maybe having a single
hard drive cage in the same style as
their two and a half inch cage but on
the other side this wouldn't have been
easy and would have possibly required
expanding the frame of the case but at
least I could install their own color
matching power supply and have at least
one hard drive installed at the same
time in the top section we have the
horizontally mounted ITX motherboard
placement along with a cable management
area which can also be used for
placement of your reservoir and/or pump
if you're looking to get into custom
water cooling this area is also
outfitted with cable management loops
which I suggest using for stuff like
you're mostly nicely sleeved header
cables and especially for their far too
freakishly long USB 3.0 header cable
which at least you can be sure won't be
too short in the top of the case you'll
find a nice on/off switch that can be
used to control your LED which looks
down onto the middle of your motherboard
and I'm happy you're able to control
this LED although I wish the switch was
on the outside of the case last but not
least there's the radiator mounting
which is surprisingly easy to utilize
due to the hook on style which is
secured in place by four screws you're
able to easily remove the radiator while
it is still attached to the rails
allowing you to move the radiator away
while it is still actually installed
making this case which at first glance
seemed very cramped actually quite open
and easy to work on in conclusion I'm
actually quite happy about the three ATT
due to its handle and small overall size
will be a great land rig and the doors
are freakin
badass if you decide to get this case
I'll be ready to open and close those
doors a lot because if you ever bring
this thing landing everyone's going to
want to see how they work its feet are
very solid and overall once everything
is installed the case is quite rigid
giving me confidence that it will be
okay even if I haul it with me around to
events which I will be doing at least
once I'm going to be taking this ring
with me to PAX Prime as unfortunately
I'm still waiting on some parts for my
personal rig speaking of Champions I am
the champion of Intel's game on contest
well I'm not really but you could be if
you're at PAX Prime on the show floor
and wearing one of their game on buttons
they have a few teams running around the
show floor handing out prizes to people
who are wearing the buttons so pay
attention to at Intel USA for hints on
where those teams will be so you can get
your prizes now game on has been pretty
successful in the past I know firsthand
but it is always lacked a component for
everyone who isn't attending pax prime
Intel's gonna be running a create your
own button contest through Twitter and
they will be giving away I can't really
say right now but trust me
it's going to be awesome and you are
going to want one more info on that
fairly soon we want you guys to be
creative use the Intel game on button
this one right here to craft your own
version however you want
maybe design one on your computer maybe
have an arts and crafts day like we did
or even I don't know bake a cupcake it's
up to you so get creative and submit
your designs to at Intel USA on twitter
using hashtag intel game on until august
29th
also check out i just teens button
creation and let intel know if she wore
it better than me on twitter i think you
know the real answer to that unless you
are a peasant among warriors so that was
weird
anyways if you guys like this video
please like it dislike it favorite it
share it subscribe to the channel all
that kind of stuff in the comments down
below let me know if you guys are
interested in these like tiny little
miniature land rigs also if you want to
let me know somewhere else jump over the
forum and let me know there while you're
on the forum if you don't like the ads
you can become a contributor and get rid
of all of them and if you click that
support us icon thing on the right hand
