limited edition t-shirt and in-game
items for planetside 2 welcome to the
first installment of our battlefield for
testing we're going to have many videos
in the battlefield for sweet we're going
to have this video which is immediate
performance of all the cards and all
their unoptimized drivers we're going to
have another video which is all the
cards later on what's the drivers had
time to matured and r9 290 comes out and
780ti comes out this we further on down
the line we're gonna have a multiplayer
benchmark one we're gonna have CPU test
we have RAM test tons of stuff and this
is beginning of November so for other
benchmarks that are coming on the way
there's Batman Assassin's Creed call
duty ghosts tons of stuff is coming for
gaming benchmarks so if you've been
missing the gaming benchmarks its
November man they're all coming right at
you right away for this video our bench
is running a 39 6 DX at 4.0 gigahertz
quad channel kit of dominators running
at 2400 megahertz and various GPUs that
have all been overclocked as you guys
all know we run all of our GPU tests
overclocked so that will not be any
different here and without further ado
we're going to jump right into my
benchmarking run
so I do this benchmark on the Singapore
mission I like to start benchmarks on
chapter starts for Battlefield
especially because that's kind of how
the safe safe system works so if we do a
chapter start mission that will work
well one thing to note is I'm recording
this with NVIDIA GeForce experience
shadow play the beta that's out and it's
actually pretty awesome so I'm recording
at 1080p at 60fps using h.264 codec and
it's working great I had some problems
with fraps where it was throwing this
crazy rainbow effect everywhere and it
made it basically unwatchable if you had
any problems with epilepsy so I decided
I'll try recording a shadow play and
actually work as I'm pretty happy about
that when you get up to the beach here
when you try and get out of the boat do
not try and move until he brings his gun
fully up because if you do for some
reason he just jumps back in the boat
which is really frustrating when you
have to free watch cutscenes to retry
ignition so yeah I recommend not moving
till I brings is gonna try to kill guys
in a consistent order you want to try
and kill the same people every time to
keep consistency up especially that
turret gunner because if you don't get
him down things will change quickly
because he will wreck you those guys
nicely flying up on the hill every
single time just allow you to mow them
down make sure you mark those guys with
QE gotta point out them extremely
effectively so the tank is ready to take
them out with one giant blast that makes
the rest of the benchmark really easy
and then you just get to stand on top of
the rock and pick people down
once we get these two kills here and I
run out of ammo at that convenient times
they're all dead we can move up the
beachhead
and when we get up to the top here we're
just going to throw a few grenades at a
clearing kill a personnel carrier and
then shoot a few times in the air just
as the benchmark ends just because we
don't want the action to stop in the
last second or two so the personnel
carrier blows the hell up and then we
shoot a few times in your benchmark and
go right around here the story's a bit
different this time around with our 290x
launch video it showed that 290x when
overclocked lost against an overclocked
780 but when they are both stock it won
in this case it's actually better in
both cases that wins stock and it wins
overclocked which is not super
surprising as battlefield 4 is
predominantly an AMD title and looking
down the line with both teams optimizing
drivers we don't really know where this
is going to end up but then again
eventually mantle is going to come out
and that's going to throw everything on
its head again so we're going to go
along this ride and just see how it
turns out we will obviously have a
mantel video when that starts becoming a
thing and we'll cover as many games as
we possibly can and these benchmarks
like I just said AMD arcs out a win and
ends up on top in many different
categories and again that wasn't that
surprising if you liked the video like
the video if you disliked the video
dislike the video and in the comments
below is there any gaming benchmarking
videos that you guys would like to see
in the future I named off a bunch of the
beginning of this video and I just named
off at least one as well so is there
anything you guys are looking forward to
is there any games you think I missed
out on yadda yadda yadda please let me
know in the comments and as always
