groundbreaking Kickstarter project for
the original rift development kit 1 and
changed the dialogue and the vision of
future gaming ever since the majority of
my personal excitement around gaming and
computers has been focused on VR even
just six or so months ago I'd say that
the general excitement in the community
was largely around oculus and the rift
but things started to change and in
January of this year I posted a poll on
Twitter and that poll resulted in a
50/50 vote between the rift and the HTC
vive out of a grand total of 3,400 ish
votes while the new poll I posted
yesterday is overwhelmingly in favor of
the vibe like 84% HTC vive and 16%
oculus rift after about 5,100 ish folks
let's explore why
intel skull Canyon Nook features the 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more in the link the
video description down below now this
isn't really a Vipers rift showdown but
i'm going to preface it with some
comparative information to at least lay
some groundwork naturally the goal of VR
devices is to give you an immersive
experience to make you feel like you're
a part of the game or the movie or
whatever it is that you happen to be
viewing or interacting with currently
when comparing these two devices is
quite possible to look at it as a simple
input output equation the rift doesn't
require a lot of input the device shows
up the setup is simple and away you go
it's a solid and rewarding experience
that I would expect the vast majority of
people to enjoy the vive when fully
utilized is a bit of a different story
the setup requires forethought in
regards to where the lighthouse sensors
will be positioned if there is enough
Headroom in order to swing the
controller's around where the PC and
your body will be positioned how you
will manage the tether etc it's also
definitely not as comfortable or as
lightweight what you get in return
however is beyond a solid experience
it's something to behold to say that
being able to walk around and move your
hands and have that translate to your
character walking around and moving
their hands in a virtual world was for
me kind of a life-changing experience
might not be the biggest exaggeration
I've ever said this is a sensation that
I have been eagerly awaiting for quite
some time now but if you're a fan of
this channel you've probably heard this
from me before and I'm sure that you'd
love to sit through me talking about how
much I love VR for 10 minutes but let's
hold off on that for a bit because I
want to show you something better
one of my favorite things about VR is
sharing my enthusiasm with others enter
Dennis and Nick
oh my god
so they were just playing a game called
the raw data from Servius it's an alpha
and definitely have some work to be done
before it's a finished product but it's
a hell of a lot of fun and even allows
for co-op gameplay this seems like a
pretty standard narrative for a lot of
VR games right now even ones that are
just more or less tech demos can be tons
of fun and a huge of them are still in
early access although their prices don't
necessarily reflect that and they've
been taking a lot of flack for that fact
I get it it's frustrating buying a
rather expensive game that doesn't turn
out to be this extensive project
masterpiece and I completely agree that
especially for VR games there should
really be an option to try a demo but
these guys have developed games and
experiences for a very small audience
and need to recoup costs so this is a
time where I'll try to vote with my
wallet and at least let them know that
we do want VR games and it is worth
developing them anyways moving on I'm
not going to waste a ton of time going
over the specific hardware specs of the
screen and the sensors and whatnot this
video has my run down between the oculus
rift and HTC vive consumer versions from
before they were released and only a
couple things have changed first you're
able to launch different games and
control things through the headset
because of the wonderful integration of
steamvr you're even able to see your
desktop and manage things easily
this being combined with being able to
activate the pass-through camera in
order to see your surroundings makes it
so as long as it doesn't make you
instantaneously nauseated that you don't
have to take your headset off until
you're done which is great for keeping
things like grease smudges off the
lenses and maintaining immersion next up
you can use the dial on the side of the
headset to control the IPD or
interpupillary distance settings and if
you pop up the grey rings around the
pivot points for the head straps you can
adjust the depth of the lenses as well
this can be especially helpful for
people who wear glasses and last is
something that I was wrong about in my
comparison video they included spare
face foam in the BA
in a slightly different size just in
case you have a more narrow face
structure
I do hope that HTC makes replacements
available for purchase however as these
are sure to stop up face wet after a
number of sessions playing something
awesome like raw data so that's it
the vive is here and it's awesome should
you buy one maybe not actually the 800
US dollars or 1149 canadian dollars that
you would have to pay is quite the price
and that's on top of having a high-end
enthusiast computer enough room in both
the x and y-axes in order to move around
and support the majority of games that
you're going to want to play on the vive
the ability to properly place your light
house sensors somewhere logical and the
extra cash at the end of the day to
essentially beta test most of the games
that are out there that are just one or
two steps beyond a tech demo I am very
happy with the experience that I'm
having and I know a bunch of others that
are as well and I'm sure a ton of you
are or would be but the vive isn't
necessarily something that I could
recommend happily to everyone our
artistic neighbor wants one so that he
can make these amazing creations and
tilt brush I've seen some of them
they're great I recommended it to him
but that's because he's a baller I just
don't want people who are strapped for
cash blowing the bank on this thing
maybe wait till your local tech shop
sets up a demo it's a lot of money it
takes a lot of dedication in terms of
space and planning and everything just
make sure that it's the right purchase
for you first wait wait wait okay I know
you don't always watch the video ad part
but this is important
Silverstone makers of you know quality
cases power supplies guys that we've
been working with forever has finally
decided to buy an ad spot on an LT T
video what could be important enough for
them to do that these cables now we
introduced these back at CES but they
are now available on Amazon what could
be interesting about a USB cable you
might ask well they're really freaking
cool
they've got reversible a type connectors
on the one side reversible mic
robee connectors on the other side it
also comes in a lightning variety for
the Apple inclined among you their
sleeved with nylon braiding their 1
meter long the connectors are
constructed with an aluminum housing
they feel really really nice and you
will never screw up which way you are
plugging in a cable again so for all the
phone manufacturers out there that are
not supporting USB type-c you don't have
to wait to have a reversible connection
on your phone they're affordable they're
available on Amazon and it's at the link
in the video description also silver
storms just a bunch of like really good
guys so if you were gonna buy a cable
then you should check out their cable
they're very nice people alright guys
thank you for watching like this video
if you liked it dislike it if you were
like burr I hate VR and I hate you if
you want to see more of our content get
subscribed going to cool t-shirt like
this this is new and stuff it's like
silver there's gold ones I don't know
take your pick check that out in the
video description down below if you want
to support us by using our Amazon
affiliate code that's cool if you want
to go to the forum become a member there
or even a contributor there that's cool
as well check out this video which I did
reference earlier but it's a good data
point anyways is the comparison between
the rift and the vibe pre-release please
note that I made that video with the
touch controllers in mind and they are
not yet available for the rift that is a
very important point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
