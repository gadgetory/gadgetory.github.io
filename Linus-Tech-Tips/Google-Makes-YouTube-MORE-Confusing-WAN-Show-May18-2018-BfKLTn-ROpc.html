oh that's good cause we're alive oh that
whole time no no no just know I've been
saying are you ready for a while it's
not like an impression or anything it's
just like oh I thought you said it you
said so many times I just assumed it was
something I didn't get I thought it was
like Muppets or something no no no no if
I was gonna do my pets I'd probably go
like Oh Kermit the Frog here maybe we're
going to do the man show like this well
that's a great Jordan Peterson
impression wouldn't Peter Sam you know
who that is is that a reference that I
should get is he famous yeah or she I
guess Jordans one of those names that
can go either way
all right so we've got a great show for
you guys today
well I mean James is here so it'll be an
adequate show for you guys today we've
got new Google Glasses is something EVGA
is apparently ditching CDs next week a
mop yes we do actually we didn't even
have a mock we had a broom we did have a
mop right a broom handle with a wig on
it oh this is good a dozen employees
quit Google in protest against a
military project and what else we got
possibly new Google glasses it's still
prototype phase and EVGA not giving new
DVDs anymore gonna give you USB sticks
instead wait how do you not have the
YouTube red thing in here that is like
the biggest news of this week I go to
our forum I look what's on the front
page of the forum then when I exhaust
the forum I go to my other favorite ARS
TechCrunch The Verge Bloomberg that must
be on there it's not okay well we're
gonna talk about that - you're gonna
wing it and I'm gonna sit back and just
take it in
yeah you're just you're just talking
over the music it's good it's terrible
no it's good no it's terrible people
hate it no they love it have you ever
watched that you ever not been on the
windrow and watched it because I lived
my life before I worked here doing that
and I liked it I liked when you guys
talked during that yay I think you were
the only one oh yeah you probably should
have had that on the screening before we
hired people like do you like it or
dislike it when we talked over the intro
music on the LAN show and that's so
that's disqualifying if you like it so
here's the thing when we hire we usually
do some kind of a skill testing quiz and
there are answers that if you get them
wrong your application gets immediately
put into a bin this guy like some matrix
equals actually would what okay I was
young he was younger than you and they
came out for one and it might only be
three years but that makes a difference
when you're talking about like a 14 year
old no they were so bad this okay
they're no different
they're they're deaf okay what were
there were there to see poles or three
sequels well there are three movies so
two sequels
okay so which hold on a second so
reloaded in revolutions both came out in
2003 and is reloaded the one with the
two weird twins yes well they're in both
movies okay
so don't take this the wrong way but I
didn't even make it through the second
one little watch the third one which I
heard was much worse
third one is worse okay you're throwing
the baby out with the bathwater because
yes hear me out okay what's the baby the
baby is like one of the best car chases
in cinema history
kick ass fight scenes like there's parts
of the matrix that aren't just the like
counterculture and cool story there's
parts of it that are make it a good
movie like the kung fu and the fight
choreography choreography or sweet and
they're really sweet in that movie
yeah so the is the fotografia good to
the photograph what another graph what
about the cinematography you know the
cinematic I can't even do that I had to
think about it also okay there's a part
where he fights a pile of CG agents
myths that looks like dog junk now but
that was good when it came out it was
cutting-edge so okay I'll admit that
watching that ven I didn't get that cuz
okay honestly the worst the worst
instances of like CGI aging badly and it
really taking you out of the experience
are when you see the evolution of
computer graphics over the course of a
series of movies okay so I think like
Lord of the Rings did a pretty good job
of this where even though the movies
were released years ago them at the same
time did they from all I believe it they
would have done they like
post-processing later though like I know
for a fact that scene in Return of the
King where they're like surrounded by
the entire army of like orcs and stuff
and I know for a fact that was done like
towards the end and that scene probably
wouldn't have even been possible with
the computer hardware that was available
when fellowship came out like that was a
really really demanding thing because
every single one of those had like some
kind of like reactionary AI or something
so I I heard they I remember reading
this article where they had a really
hard time getting the heroes to not like
try to break out and run away or
something
like they had to force them to stay
inside this ring oh and because they've
because there were like
self-preservation thanks anyway
apparently it was part of the way that
they did like the really large scale
like overviews of the battlefield anyway
so one of the series that really
suffered from this for me is oh oh oh oh
oh people are people are spoilers we're
talking about the lord of the matrix
1999 people people are mad because we're
not talking about tech okay we are
talking
about technology and movies technically
that is tech also like the Venn diagram
is almost completely overlapped with
this audience and Lord of the pens and
these movie is like how can you anyway
anyway okay so uh that's right the Harry
Potter movies because not only were the
first two and especially the first one
done like before the later ones because
obviously that's how it works
except Star Wars so okay that's the
thing oh shut up not only that but they
were way lower budget like you can
really tell looking up and you're like
oh wow they like weren't even really
trying with some of this stuff I
remember being a child and seen the
first one I'm thinking the it was pretty
good me to control came on screen but
like if it's cutting edge for the time
than the second one but oh wait is that
no you're right that isn't the first one
yeah so so yeah it was no no I don't
even think that was top of the line at
the time but it was like pretty good so
they were lower budget they were done
earlier and I went back and rewatched
the entire thing because they had like a
box at Costco with the whole thing and I
bought it because I'm an idiot and I was
like wow these are kids movies and then
Prisoner of Azkaban rolls around you're
like oh yeah now that's one yeah now
they're like real movies all of a sudden
so do you think they should do every
release like they did with Star Wars
when they up that green master it make
the graphics better you know what
because aside from Daniel Radcliffe Emma
whatever her name is Watson thank you
and then whatever Universal ginge the
most famous ginger ever yeah what does
he like drive a bus now or something
well yeah I heard you like got out of
show business and you just want it to
like drive a bus that'd be sweet yeah
yeah no they Lewis moved to Italy for
like five years just to make shoes
I want yeah anyway because aside from
their acting getting markedly better
also like you could probably you could
probably you could resi GI it i think
you could actually make it a
significantly more immersive movie hmm
she had George Lucas on it he should be
on the team just oversee it yeah it's
got experience in this he's it was a
good job he does a hell of a job but he
undertakes those projects anyway back to
Agent Smith I will agree with you
that at the time that didn't pull me out
of the movie like I felt like that's
pretty cool wow it really looks like
he's fighting a bunch of agents myths
mm-hmm that was still a terrible movie
with us the thing is a lot of people the
immersion not being broken for me a lot
of people just hate the fact that he
fought a bunch of agents oh I was
actually okay with that because I was
also a kid okay yeah no it was I
that's like far from the worst part of
that movie it was just oh it is the
worst part is that when he has powers
outside of the matrix at the end spoiler
because that's I think like the biggest
division between the first one in the
sequels III you know what I'm gonna be
honest with you I don't remember it well
enough I just remember it being free
you're just bandwagoning all the people
who hate it you should watch again the
cards okay look I watched the first one
again like a couple years in that last
weekend and it's so bad oh it's awesome
God moving on it is so bad like there's
no way I would like the second one if
the first one has aged that poorly it's
so cheesy the leather like the leathers
not cool anymore no no it's not and the
worst part is that like I've seen Keano
a Keano Keanu actually act reasonably
well I'm sure of it camper call it right
now how can you say whoa as good as he
says whoa in that movie I feel like I
have to try
I just I just jump I just jumped from
the building we're standing on to
another skyscraper across the way this
pickle ad that I'm looking at you know
what that's you an angry green dick
right there that's you
which one left or right uh you know what
you're the shorter one huh bear little a
little greater though take that all
right all right why don't we do an
actual tech topic at some point here so
the verge has an article here on a
reported new Google glass it'll be an AR
headset and oh wow I was gonna say it
looks just as bad no no no not zero I
ain't no that's I hesitate to even call
it a new Google glass because I suspect
that they're gonna change it all
together that probably wouldn't be a
terrible thing because it is impossible
not to look like a complete jackass
wearing that thing
yeah so my theories about why the first
one failed have to do exactly with the
things that they thought were highlights
they thought it was so good that the
camera was up and out of your eye sight
you have to look up at it to see it you
mean the screen the camera on the screen
but I mean sorry you're right but that
makes it so useless because what you
want is like a mixed reality you want
all the digital stuff to be right there
so yes host that's what they're doing
with this one is more like hololens okay
but it's untethered self-contained it'll
have cameras and microphones and it'll
use the same new Qualcomm chips as the
upcoming hololens so it's a QSC 6:03
fork or chip based on an ARM
architecture it'll be built by taiwanese
computer maker quanta and is apparently
still in the prototyping stage so is
that all we know about it right now
I think so I think that's that's
basically I would say it's probably on
the same bit of production cycle as the
the rumored Apple what's it called
Project Titan their glasses hmm
whose do you think will be better mmm
because Google will have a much better
AI I mean Siri
I swear Siri has actually gotten Dumber
over the last few years well I would
think that apples would maybe be a
better hardware product and they're a
are there a are kit a our stuff is quite
good but it will certainly be tethered
with the iPhone because Apple now makes
products to squeeze more money out of I
phone users whereas this being
purportedly untethered like I'm reading
that as a completely standalone device
you don't even need to have a phone if
that's true then it has the assistant on
it to be useful right and that's a whole
different game that's the apples and
oranges at that point and I don't even
like I don't I'm just trying to hear
okay here's my issue with augmented
reality is like you know what I actually
this is unusual but I want to hear from
twitch chat I want you guys to start
throwing some some some messages in the
twitch chat let me know what and you
can't you can't head
you can't hedge okay you got to pick one
what is one thing that you want a
hourglasses to do that would make you
buy and I'm gonna throw a price point at
you let's say they're not cheap I'm
gonna say 500 US dollars oh I thought
you're gonna say a thousand no 500 I
think 500 is reasonable so 500 US
dollars and you pull the trigger
immediately what's the feature go so are
you ready with one cuz I got one it's
ready you go you don't go first okay so
for me one of the things that I have
like I can't think of anything
personally that would inspire me to
spend that kind of money because my
entire life pretty much revolves around
my phone screen or my computer screen
and I've I don't find myself having a
desire to overlay information on top of
a screen with a screen like that's not
really a thing I get up in the morning I
like check the news on my phone ate my
breakfast I take my kids to school I
Drive so I'm driving then I get to work
I sit down in front of you tur or
shooting in which case I'll have my
phone with me if I need to like send out
a quick tweet or whatever something you
won't be able to do with glasses anyway
then I Drive home then I spend time with
my kids then I am on a screen or or not
on a screen ideally that that's it so
I'm never that far away if I like really
need to you know look something up and
that's Smart Watch - of course for me
the justification would be business okay
so when I'm traveling if I had the
ability to be at like a some kind of a
cocktail mixer or something or if I
walked into a business meeting or like
the suite at Computex for a soos and
this thing starts recognizing people
that are on my social networks so then
all I have to do is like add people to
Facebook or LinkedIn or there's an app
that does something like that yet moki
but here's the thing it needs to do it
well so it needs to be able to go okay
here's their name here's a couple things
about them here's the last email that
you exchanged with them if applicable
like it needs to be able to aggregate
all of this data and help me avoid
embarrassing situations where like I'm
like yeah it was really nice to meet you
and they're like we've had three
meetings over the last you know eight
years and I'm just like well that's
enough meetings that I should feel
really bad but in my defense when I go
to these types of shows I usually meet
anywhere from 200 to 500 people in a
span of a week and I'm sorry but unless
you you have like bright orange hair on
one side and bright purple hair on the
other side I'm probably not gonna
remember you
it's how max got hired by the way she
was the most memorable application I
actually was involved in look what you
describing sounds to me like what the
Facebook app for that form factor would
be yeah and it's consistent with
Google's ultimate vision which is not
only like here can I jump in cuz these
are these are going away too quickly I
jump in with some other people's things
hold that so man some
people are asking for unreasonable
things like complete replacement of your
smartphone and SmartWatch and put
there's no the imp oh yeah there I don't
think that makes any sense okay
google maps with AR yeah I can see that
having a value that would be sweet the
navigation is just right over top of the
road yeah all right but really 500 bucks
you'd buy it for that like how often do
you really navigate somewhere exactly if
I was an uber driver maybe yeah so again
that's a professional use though um
Google search info okay Wow holy crap
this is respecting women way too fast if
this device respected women I'd buy it
like that dash cam feature like
shadowplay being able to go back and
record any moment in your life just
recording everything there's an episode
of Dark Mirror like that or in black
mirror you don't want that yeah I could
see it being used it's also a big
problem when does that oh wow
relationship status I could see a lot of
people buying it for that that would be
sweet like you basically like the tinder
app for that form factor you walk around
it's like yep that's a tinder user oh
wow that okay imagine like real world
tinder people walking around with these
headsets just like oh wow and you could
swipe with your head so you just look at
people be like no you know someone you
see them there's a thing over your head
you both know the others on tinder
they're looking at you going like this
you're like like you make eye contact
across the room and you're both just
like yeah a lot of people are sorted
desk though nope
a lot of people are saying porn but like
why like why do you who would want to be
walking around with like a raging
erection because they're like watching
porn while they're on the bus like what
is the point of that like I know I know
okay
so here's the thing it's like I think
most people are probably just saying
that to be funny but I'm sure at least a
handful of you
I'm sure at least a handful of you
legitimately would watch porn on a plane
or on a bus or whatever if you could and
to those people I would say really like
really like III think I think you know
what I think I'm not gonna get it I
imagine all the extensions you could get
all the hilarious filters you could get
where like someone's talking to you and
you just see objects around their head
like okay
Hwang's coming at ya Hwang's around
linus via of you arguing schematics and
diagrams like large scale schematics and
diagrams like if you could have whatever
you're working on and then you could
just like have a picture-in-picture
effectively over your vision of of like
a manual or something along those that's
actually what I would pick what I would
pick as a collaborative like virtual
object app where you and I could sit we
could be having a conversation now you
have an idea you want to describe the
idea to me instead of using limited
language you just say okay here's a cube
and you rotate it and it tracks your
hands so you can manipulate it eros taka
has another commercial purpose if you
worked at a car dealership and the
client comes in and asks you a question
about like that used car like you know
who was the previous owner how many
kilometers does it have on it
all of a sudden you get to be like
bippity Boppity sir I've got all those
answers for you give me one minute I
just have to stare at the car for a
second yeah it's all loaded all right so
here's what we got for you I know I can
see that again another professional
application so I see this being a
professional device initially much like
hololens but that's consistent with
Google's what's google lens right
Google's ultimate aim was to bring
information to you before you query it
you don't even have to search it comes
to you as you need it and that's what
lens is if you looked at Google i/o last
week they had demos where you're you're
basically walking around Chicago and you
look at a historic building and yeah up
comes a Wikipedia page for it and it's
an AR so it's got the nice depth to it
that's that's exactly what you're
talking about you look at an object of
relevance to you and like that yeah but
I just you know I'm not much of a like
information about this building buff
like for me you walk by a restaurant
looks okay and then there's the four
star rating their reviews okay that
would be useful but here's the problem
it has to actually work like I was in
London this week and I'm I'm standing
where I'm standing I got my little you
know blue dot facing whatever direction
it thinks I'm facing that seems to be
just kind of like a yeah come on baby
yes not accurate at all and I search for
food which I would think would bring up
restaurants or restaurant or whatever I
searched for something and it just it's
just random like like I walked past an
Italian restaurant that looked fine and
had a good rating when I like manually
search for it
on my way to the Italian restaurant that
it brought up in the search result I'm
just guys sitting here going Italian was
right in the name and it was on my way
like it was closer to me than the thing
that you found like it just seems
arbitrary a--sometimes and so it's it's
frustrating for me too for Google to
come out and say we're gonna have this
amazing technology your phone is gonna
call your hairstylist and make an
appointment for you you're gonna put on
these glasses and they're gonna
dynamically tell you everything you need
to know about everything you're looking
at and they don't even have the basic
stuff working right now Italian freaking
restaurant well there's a problem right
there handle that I wanted pizza okay
actually didn't want pizza I wanted
anything that my wife would also be
that's what I wanted that is get full I
do that for you oh thank you I did that
nice I know I intentionally didn't put
icing because when you have ice and your
water boil you drink it weird you can't
or your mouth so that the ice doesn't
come out I just don't like the way your
face looks when you do it I don't like
warm water to the hole it's not warm you
know like just just for you I'm gonna
drink my water like that all the time
now show everyone I'm talking about
don't you hate that just deal with it
speaking of deals this episode is
brought to you by madrenas coffee

Internet access supports a variety of
VPN protocols and types of encryption
and authentication so it's it's a VPN
and you can dial in the protection
however you want they've got apps for
Windows Mac iOS Android iOS Linux and
Google Chrome with support for other
platforms coming soon you can connect up
to five devices at the same time so you
can have like your server and your home
computer your laptop and both of your
phones it's actually a lot of devices
and the coolest thing about private
Internet access since I know you guys
probably already have it is
you can get it as a gift for people that
you know that should use a VPN but don't
so you can get it as a gift for them set
it up for them turn it on configure it
so that it's just all these on and then
you don't have to worry about whatever
it is that they do their information
getting translate stuff that's sweet go
check it out at private Internet access
comm / pages / - - tech - tips uh-oh oh
we've got one more sponsor actually
could you be us get tickets at LTX expo
calm it is a meet-up an interactive tech
event it's gonna be on July 14th at the
Richmond Olympic Oval here in BC Canada
the current booths include a land
powered by iBUYPOWER ad living workshop
so you can deal it a CPU you bring your
own CPU will show you how to deal with
it case tossed 2.0 were you were you at
LTX last year I do work here yet staff
to the case tossed right right right so
that was how dangerous was that out of
10 a woman almost almost shocked forget
us here there's a cage-like nine out of
ten multi-headed VR will be there 12 k
ultra wide gaming and we've got more
stuff on the way there's gonna be food
music cool systems to look at will
Ellen's ears extra room to stand in more
games more swag special guests I believe
J is planning to be there so that's
gonna be pretty sweet we have some
people who are like committed on paper
but like don't want to necessarily 100%
lock it down so they don't want us to
like talk about it but there there
should be other celebrity guests the
wall method is Obama Obama gonna be
there Obama's not gonna be there uh so
tickets start at $35 Canadian you can
get them at LTX expo calm colton I'm
done the spot for LTX Expo you're not
allowed to talk about it anymore he
doesn't even know that Obama's gonna be
there Obama's not gonna be there yeah he
could be no unless it's like some other
Obama like if you go in the phone book
can you look up Obama it's not a common
name I don't think so right
yeah I think so Barack is is that a
common name now yeah during his credit
presidency a lot of people there's a
bunch of like seven year-olds named
Barack yeah
and turning 12 that would explain why I
keep encountering more and more Linus's
it's because like I inspired parents I
don't think the Mellaril of Linus
Atlantis's I think when you have
multiple Linus it's just line it I think
no no no it would be like - I or
something
no oh yeah Nexus or line I would be like
line I Nexus like like like penis is p9
that's true you have a point there uh
EVGA did you see these four USB sticks
this was originally posted on the forum
by vegetable stew and the original I
love that guy's name by the way is from
yeah it's s tu haha oh yeah okay stew
like it his name is Amos - dang it a non
tech how do I get rid of this thank you
this is actually something I asked you I
asked you as a noob I was like why are
they giving discs when I die and
everyone else doesn't have a drink it
doesn't have a DVD player anymore and
you told me it's because it's way more
expensive to give away flash drives an
EVGA actually confirm that even though
EVGA is ditching DVDs for their all the
drivers and giving you an 8 gigabyte
flash drive instead they actually did
admit that it's 20 times more expensive
you can give you a flash drive they're
still doing it so 20 times more
expensive would be like says how much
does I think I think a disc costs like
on the order of like three cents or
something like that
like I like basically it's probably
costing them a few bucks though for each
one with that said EVGA has a bit of an
advantage here compared to other
motherboard makers because they don't
really make any entry-level boards so
every motherboard that they sell we'll
have enough margin in it that they could
probably afford to throw in a USB Drive
and there have been high-end boards
before that came with USB drives yeah
they're not the first do it that's
freaking awesome though especially
because flash
NAND flash has gotten to the point where
it's not any more cost-effective to make
like a one gig USB Drive than it is to
do an 8 gig USB Drive like 8 gigs is the
size they start at so that's what EVG is
providing and what's cool about that is
8 gigs is exactly the right size for you
to be able to use it for and it's odd
install ISO a DVD ISO oh I thought
you're gonna say 2 blu-rays no cuz it's
not enough for that
whoever's like four gigs no DVDs for
gigs blu-rays how about 40 what TV DS
were like 700 bytes
no that's CDs 650 or 700 DVDs or four
point seven and then blu-rays are like
40 and 80 like Bigelow they've got much
higher like 20 40 80 or something like
that when I used to be a scumbag who
taunted movies they were always about
700 megabytes yeah that's because there
were 720p seriously downscaled so that
scrubs like you yeah who were too cheap
not only to buy movies but also to pay
for more internet download the Holly yep
didn't go over their data limits so
blu-rays are 25 and 50 gigs okay yeah um
well you can put some Word documents on
it how about that wait eight gigs no you
can put that DVD you can put an ISO on
it that's what I'm trying to say so they
say the cost increase will not trickle
down to the consumer which is of course
nonsense
I think all that means is they're not
adjusting the pricing of their current
generation of boards but that doesn't
mean that when they consider the bomb
cost the bill of materials for their
next generation that they won't consider
that that's another two or three dollars
mean this could have been two dollars
cheaper this whole time um okay this was
originally posted over on Gizmodo it was
posted on the forum by Pyrrha I pi pi pi
pi r yeah I think and dozens of
employees have quit Google in protest
against a military project was this
project maven
okay wait a second a dozen not dozens
yeah sorry I'm a dozen so far so project
maven is a project that Google is
working on in club really a project they
called it project maven and it's a
project it's undertaking Wow okay you do
it do tell me more no no actually you
have to do it because I'm checking
that's on the YouTube premium thing that
you didn't put in here despite protests
from employees why would it employee
ever protest Google is charging ahead
with the Department of Defense
collaboration to produce machine
learning software for American military
drones project maven aims to speed up
the analysis of drone footage by
automatically classifying images of
objects and people and now a dozen
people at Google employees are resigning
in protest over the company's continued
involvement and this is in addition to
about 4,000 employees who have voiced
concern in a petition that was
circulated internally yeah so basically
project maven is a way of using AI to
identify targets in for and okay it
doesn't say explicitly but the the
assumption so this is all like allegedly
but the assumption is that the
technology is going to be used to
identify targets for drone strikes is
ultimately what people are mostly upset
about Google has emphasized the google
claims it is only providing open-source
software to project maven which means
the military would be able to still use
the technology even if Google didn't
accept
payment or offer technical assistant and
they have emphasized that it's AI is not
being used to kill the technology is
used to flag images for human review and
is intended to save lives and save
people from having to do highly tedious
work and of course I mean you could see
that the objections to this their
mission statement from the beginning was
don't be evil yeah but that's nowhere in
their documentation anymore as far as I
know but it's still baked into the
company ethos and a lot of people who
work there make its bought it's possible
that you worked there for a long time
and that was the mission statement and
when you were hired and for a lot large
part of your career
second part of it is that Google it's
been argued that Google has is mandated
to protect all of its users and they
have a global user base so this is this
project serves the interests of the US
and the weaponry that's developed from
it could be used to harm Google users
who are not in the US so where does the
responsibility lie this is great frontal
on the in twitch at deciding whether or
not to kill someone
equals highly tedious work so there are
other American companies major tech
companies including IBM and Amazon that
have refused to work with the US Defense
Department but the counter-argument to
that I don't think you read that
correctly sorry what's that in addition
to the petition circulating inside
Google the total the petition sorry
there was another petition that tried to
get other companies like IBM and Amazon
to work together to refuse to work with
the US Defense Department
so the counter-argument to that is like
well don't you want the united america
to you know keep up with you know other
countries like you know it is it's like
do you think that the engineers at Baidu
are quitting because they don't want to
do defense contracts with the Chinese
government do you think that's happening
the engineers at Yandex in Russia do you
want the u.s. to be overpowered by other
nations that that get this kind of work
done from the private sector well
private sector
I mean what do you is Baidu private
sector technically I don't know well
that's the other thing
what happens to you if you protest I
don't not even go in there so if it's
gonna be happening anyway then who do
you want to hold this kind of technology
I could see why you wouldn't want to be
the one working on it but you should
probably understand that when you walk
away there's another engineer is gonna
work on it and if that engineer and then
you thought engineers not at Google that
injury will be is either from a
different company in the US or another
company in different country but I do
apparently not state-owned as of this
article from 2015 I don't know if it's I
don't know if that's up to date but I
was just curious oh that's not what I
thought you meant explicitly but all
right um all right so let's move on then
to YouTube's complete dog's breakfast
iam sorry excuse me
YouTube premium so the original article
here is from the verge and basically so
how much do you know about YouTube bread
mmm very little okay
so right now okay I'm just trying to I'm
trying to remember what YouTube music is
oh yeah you're right crap what is
YouTube music we will always does this I
know it's so frustrating okay no no so
that one's coming soon okay okay so
Google okay so on the Play Store you can
like get music okay but I think trying
to remember all the different like
whatever let's just go with how it was
up until now so Google Play Music lets
you stream music and like download music
to your device okay it's like I forget
it's like $10 a month or $8 a month or
15 for family but those are credential I
had the family plan and yeah I pay like
$15 Canadian or $60 Canadian or
something like that
okay so then for a few US dollars more
than Google Play Music you can get
YouTube read which strips the ads out of
YouTube videos that is the like the
Google supplied the Adsense supplied ads
and and gives you access to google play
music it also gives you additional
benefits within the YouTube app so the
ability to play song videos for example
with the screen off with the phone in
your pocket is just how it works now cuz
I thought before it was like if you
bought google play music you just got
YouTube read and I think it was the
other way around and I really mean like
I got music and I was super stoked on
that and then I found out that wasn't in
the that was not in Canada okay let's
just let's just let's just do how it's
gonna work now okay all right so so
YouTube red is gone apparently they were
tired of being called red tube no
kidding you it is red yeah I know I know
right how could they impossible red tube
has been around since like 2007 or
something like that know something like
wow look at him covering covering you
know because YouTube itself came out in
2007 so red too must have been them no
YouTube was 2005 that's fine um okay so
YouTube red is being replaced sort of by
YouTube premium which gives you ad free
music the ability to listen in the
background correct and downloads as well
as ad free video the ability to play in
the background this is cool downloads on
YouTube videos so you will now be able
to load up YouTube videos on your phone
before a flight or whatever I should not
have to use one of those ripping tools
when I want to rip something off um
sweet I can finally get them in their
native mean compensate the artists is
that what you mean anyway also all
YouTube originals so YouTube red
originals or whatever they were calling
those are now just called YouTube
originals and then YouTube music premium
for just two dollars less so this is
like a pretty terrible deal as far as I
can tell just gives you add free music
so other other videos will have ads and
the ability to listen in the background
and download music specifically and then
how Google Play Music figures into all
this I can't remember yes right if you
have a Google Play Music subscription
you get youtube music as part of that
membership play music is not going away
yet but
we play music got it what's that in
other news YouTube premium is finally
coming to Canada so I plan to get it
immediately because I am so tonight
editor's can ripoff I am so tired no
it's nothing to do with that it's
because YouTube forces me to break their
own Terms of Service every day because
you you are not allowed according to
Google's Terms of Service to watch your
own ads or interact with your own ads
because it inflates your viewership
numbers that's like being an Amazon
affiliate and sending getting your
friends to buy the thing you're an
affiliate for no that's fine
no you can't do that you can't no I
can't be like hey guys I here's my
affiliate link to buy this t-shirt all
my friends and family if you're gonna
buy this t-shirt use my link you can't
do that
oh I see what you mean okay well it's a
little I think it's a little bit
different from that because it's like
actually like it's it's it's it amounts
to it like it's a holdover from the days
of click fraud where written websites
would have banners up on their sites and
then they'd like just click on their own
ads all day yeah so that they could get
a bunch of money but but no one ever
actually looked at that so anytime I
watch a video like an on skippable video
I'm skippable ad for example might show
up and then I sit through it I have
effectively fraudulently given an
impression to that video don't they know
the IP of the uploader but if they know
that and know it's a little more
complicated than that because I could be
using a different device but we're
talking about a logged in mm-hmm so I've
been asking Google for this for ages
when I'm logged in don't serve an ad on
my video but they cannot figure this out
or they just don't care
but the second one is more likely one so
finally I won't have to break Google's
Terms of Service just but by being a
youtuber and that's wonderful that makes
my heart fuzzy
they're like stop we all know you use ad
blocker no I don't all right so what
else do what else do we have today do we
have anything interesting
oh oh oh yeah okay so for anyone who was
sort of speculating that maybe Asus
really wanted to do the area's brand no
they did not
they as of now now that uh now that
GeForce partner program is officially
dead
Erez is gone ROG is back so that's good
glad that's all behind us conclusive
yeah do you think there's gonna are
there any eras cards out there this
could be like a Larabee thing if we can
get our hands on one that'd be cool I
don't think so I mean if there's an
employee out there as one that'd be
really cool to get our hands on that um
all right according to WC CF Texas is
supposed to buy black Cup on the forum
we've got rumors of a GTX his name was
what Evan T black Cup
no it's woke up got its buck up Oh buck
up
you need to buck uh sorry add black cup
look I come from a home covered in black
Cup I come from eight time zones away
right now I landed back in this country
like 24 hours ago same people who are
still in that time zone field so
according to the leaks the GTX 1170 will
be powered by a 104 class GPU codenamed
GT 104 what would t be so it's not Volta
what was it Tom oh I don't remember what
the rumored T codename was gonna be
there'll be approximately 400
millimeters square so that's a pretty
big chip okay 2688 CUDA cores 256 bit
DDD are six memory interface 8 to 16
gigs of DDR 6 memory slot that's good
that it has an interface that matches
the amount of are the type of memory
it's rumored to have so the rumor
managed to get hopefully at least that
much right clocks of 1.5 to 1.8
gigahertz depending on boost so this
would put it in the same league as the
existing GTX 10 atti
so once again if you invested haha
infested because of crypto haha if you
invested not invested if you plunked
down the money for a top-tier card a
top-tier ti card you are once again
going to have to wait two generations in
order to get any kind of significant
upgrade from Nvidia so we've seen this a
lot of times now where the GTX 680 Ti
was the last time they late gtx 60 no
they never did a 680 TI so the gtx 680
was the top tier of that generation and
then in the next gen there was a 770
that was exactly the same thing and then
17 maybe it's 700 series that I'm
thinking of so 700 series
yeah then you got a 980 that didn't know
then the 980 TI didn't come till later
that's right so 780 Ti was very similar
in performance to the GTX 980 so when
the 900 series rolled around if you had
a top to your card there was basically
no upgrade for you until the 980 TI came
or the yeah the 980 TI came quite some
time later then a 980 TI was actually
quite similar to a 1070 or 1080 so there
wasn't much of an upgrade there until
the 1080i came quite a bit later so you
actually have to kind of wait at least a
half generation in order to get an
upgrade if you bought the top-tier card
from last time around so if that
combined with the fact that the 10
series launched I planned it the 10
series launch GTX 10 to the 10 ATT I
launched let's find out the TI yeah so
that was back in March of 2017 so it's
been a full year you will still have no
upgrade path from that so the only
people who will be upgrading are
probably people who bought 10 80s or
before so that was way back in May 2016
people who bought 10 80s and who've been
waiting for a significant upgrade at
that same price tier and we don't
actually don't even know anything about
pricing because while the criminal
once there is one tidbit about the
pricing here oh that it's gonna cost
more than it did last generation 500
bucks sure that's that's what is being
guessed apparently for the 1170
specifically alright and that's a super
rumor that's just like whispers around
the industry indicate yeah NVIDIA has
been known to mislead people like I
still remember there was a launch might
have been the 580 or something like that
where they literally changed the pricing
on us the day before and like no one
knew their own partners sigh a lot of
money but was like buy a hundred dollars
or something that was pretty significant
up or down um down yeah yeah can't
complain though right yeah that's old
news though in video like surprising the
industry with great pricing that's not
SC to Mitch posted this one on the forum
this was originally posted on inside
games dot biz and I gotta say this
shouldn't surprise me but it does it
shouldn't because it's been on the wine
show before well whatever
I probably skipped it cuz I was like oh
that's boring so the IOC is to host an
eSports summit in whatever however you
pronounce that lizanne Lausanne in July
there's supposed to be a French speaker
oh is it French since Switzerland
alright so basically this is just to
continue the organization's dialogue
with the gaming industry it's just a
one-day meeting and in due course
approach the stakeholders of the Olympic
movement again never gonna happen man
eSports will never be in the Olympics
and I argue that they don't belong in
the Olympics I'm not gonna disagree with
you I'm not even gonna play devil's
advocate here cuz I don't think it makes
a ton of sense but with that said there
is stuff in the Olympics that I don't
necessarily think belongs in the ellipse
or sure I mean here you know what let's
bring up the fullest speed walking and
stuff look I mean the stuff hard but the
point is that it's athletic the way I
look at it is in athletics there's
something you intend to do there's an
action you want to carry out you see
that action in your mind
and then because your body it has crappy
tolerances even though you want to throw
that ball into that particular spot you
just can't do it but in a video game for
the most part you can you want your
units to move right there you click
there and they move there so I think the
fact that there's greater tolerances
that you don't have much control over on
your own body that's what really
separates I mean you could make the
argument that moving the motor very
precisely is a pretty good analog for
that sure but that's only a part of the
game and not the whole game there aren't
really a lot they were
Olympic events than I thought actually
most of these aren't that steep let's
winter though no no I got both okay okay
hand ball are you gonna put it on the
screen really handball handball is huge
in Europe man there's a bunch of people
yelling at you right now
huge pretty ba - all right well then
fine
so-so is there is there anything here
that we really think is pretty dumb
football guys kicking the buzz and make
any sense joking joking
equestrian that's kind of weird what is
dressage a dressage it's like fancy
walking on horses it's but again this is
like the horse I guess there's skill and
training a horse and I'm sure there's
skill as a rider but you're telling me
that if the rider gets hurt that day and
you still got the good horse you're not
gonna just send someone else on top of
that good horse and still maybe win I
don't know anything about this sport
okay here's another angle that John
Martin here the writer of tech quickie
told me when we discussed this all those
months ago or maybe there's someone on
the forum they basically said an
interesting angle is the fact that video
games are commercial products so you're
gonna go on to the Olympics and you're
gonna broadcast something that Blizzard
owns or something for example so you
think there's a potential like licensing
issue here or just like the IOC wanting
to be paid ultimately maybe that someone
wanting to get paid or at least being
free advertising right it's bizarre and
then there's another quote here that
says that they're not going to do
anything
they said killer games but the guy has a
has an accent so but violent games and
that's like half the games half it can
be like the competitive ones especially
yeah like what what games are
competitive that don't involve killing I
mean I guess like dota is a lot better
than call of duty okay yeah okay or
something but that's a fair point
but you you're not gonna watch direct or
something I'm gonna watch Civilization
six in the Olympics yeah I mean all
right they're games they're not sports
so they're like there's stuff that you
could like shooting is shooting a sport
then where's the game what why not like
shooting a target like it's super physic
or like archery where's your argument
that it's not well yeah okay games are
in the mind
you think games are in the mind the mind
chess is a quintessential game Youth you
compute what you want to happen and the
the action of carrying out that task
yeah is a non-issue you just pick it up
and put it there that's not the hard
part of the game it's the computation
that's the hard part of the game in
sports
it's the carrying out of the task that's
difficult everybody wants to get the
ball across the line it's doing that as
hard I would argue that I would argue
that video games sit in between though I
agree like it I very just very area I
agree with that but if you say it'll
never have I think they're way closer to
the game end
I'm sure twitch chat is hitting us up
with some games that aren't that don't
have killing okay rocket League I can't
rocket league is just soccer yeah I
can't imagine watching rocket League
like in the Olympics I just I like it
man I I have a hard time like it's such
a ridiculous concept I think the like
these cars running around and like using
their butts to hit a giant ball into a
thing like I just you know what you're
hitting on right now is the level of
abstraction with video games compared to
the real sports because what happens
everyone has a common experience within
the Olympics come on Street Fighter
okay the Super Smash
we're gonna be great fighter in smash
okay okay - come on you've never watched
pole-vaulting in your life you've never
watched the sport in your life but
you're sitting there and you just
instantly get it you can appreciate when
someone does a good job you're like that
was amazing yeah that'll never happen
with eSports someone puts on a Starcraft
2 match you don't know that they have
all these battle cruises you're just
like oh that guy has ships okay like
it's too abstract it from a visceral
feeling that we can all share yeah I
agree with you I think it's far more
likely that they'll just make their own
Olympics I agree the black dude they
should have and you know we on France
line yeah close friends that you pay to
hang out with you
employees hey friends have the night got
those I'm out of here
all right so I think that's pretty much
it for the wine show today we will see
you guys again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel that's
all that no guarantee on the time don't
talk I'm gonna talk don't talk to you
never get oh yeah yeah I'm can sing on
the intro alright fine
never gonna turn around desert you how
weird is that guy's voice though
yeah this guy was talking to me put this
thing look good yeah and that one
