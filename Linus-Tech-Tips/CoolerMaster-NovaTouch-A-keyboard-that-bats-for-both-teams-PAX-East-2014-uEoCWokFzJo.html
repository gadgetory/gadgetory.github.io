2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair hey guys I'm here at
coolermaster checking out their Nova
touch which is a really interesting
keyboard with a really interesting key
design so what can you tell me about
this keyboard and it's interesting
switch okay so the Nova touch tkl is a
brand new keyboard that coolermaster is
currently working on now this is pretty
much an evolution of a traditional
mechanical keyboard what we have here
are specialized key switches which are
essentially an electrostatic capacitive
technology where they pretty much feel
like a hybrid between a traditional a
traditional mechanical keyboard key
switch and a membrane keyboard so pretty
much we have these switches here and
they we made sure that the key cap stems
are compatible with cherry MX key caps
so for all those keyboard enthusiasts
who love to switch out their key caps we
got we made them compatible backwards
compatible with cherry MX key caps so
that should be something that their
people should be pretty excited about
it's really cool because a lot of times
when you're shopping for key caps really
the only ones available are cherry MX
key caps so it's cool that you can
actually get something else now when
typing on this it feels a lot like a
topor can you tell me more about that
yes so pretty much the Nova touch key
switch is based off of the the Japanese
made taupe ray key switches so what
you're gonna be getting essentially is a
very a very nice tactile feedback as you
press the switch you'll get a nice bump
feedback which it feels like pretty much
an implosion of a sphere because that's
pretty much how the key switch works we
have a mechanical switch that is encased
within a silicone injection molding and
every time you press down pretty much
that silicone bubble
deflates a shock absorbing all the
shocks so pretty much you're getting all
of the friction which is in typical
mechanical key switches completely
absorbed giving you a pretty much
smoother experience compared to
traditional key switches so this is very
good for people who pretty much just
type all day whether you're a student
you're a coder or you know a journalist
maybe um the top ray key switch the Nova
touch keyboard is meant for very long
periods of use I feel like it's like if
you had to compare it to a cherry
keyboard it's like a really soft brown
because you can still feel the tactile
bump when you're coming
but it is a lot softer now it's a 10
kilos keyboard and I've seen a lot of
trending lately with people wanting to
buy 10 kilos keyboards just a lot of
gamers don't end up actually using the
number pad firstly I use the number pads
I usually buy 4 full keyboards but what
does coolermaster think about the trend
and people buying 10 keyless keyboards
people really love the 10 keyless design
it's just for various reasons some
people like it for the fact that it's
smaller it's more portable you know it's
easier to take with you on the go cool
thanks for one more thing like you said
very portable this does have a
detachable USB cable so if you do need
that number pad you can you can swap out
keyboards if you want or you can move it
around really easily because you don't
have to worry about the cable bending in
your bag thank you Alex for running us
through this keyboard thank you for
