if something that's a little bit
different from what I usually talk about
on my channel this is the materia and
what it is is essentially a way of
wirelessly transmitting HDMI data to
your TV from your Mac ok so let's go
ahead and have a look at the back this
actually won the best of show award at
the at Macworld 2011 so here you go
brings your Mac screen to HDTV via Wi-Fi
and you can control your Mac from the TV
ok so we've got like kind of a
wirelessly looking symbol we've got kind
of a wirelessly looking symbol and a
wireless silicon symbol it all goes here
and then you are able to control it from
your TV so your Mac doesn't even
actually have to be in the same room it
works off Wi-Fi actually here we can
have a look at the Mac PC requirements
really quick so it requires a dual-core
1.4 gigahertz or better it requires a
graphics card with 128 Meg's of RAM or
more so pretty much anything in the
recent past Mac OS 10.5 plus ok here's
some recommended models excellent oh ok
apparently works on PC as well look at
that with Vista or Windows 7 ok well
that's that's neat Sahin alright
wirelessly bringing the Mac screen to
the TV with synchronized audio even
remotely operate your Mac from the TV
with standard USB keyboard and mouse
also works as a home wireless access
point that's cool and support for PC
Center for Windows 7 Vista through
additional software ok let's open this
up and have a look at it so the first
thing we find inside is please visit us
for the latest drivers and firmware
updates and manual download a that's
great advice isn't it don't use this
please visit us for the latest thank you
guys I appreciate that there is a quick
installation guide so since I'm actually
curious about how to install this we are
going to take a closer look for a change
alright before you start there are four
set up possibilities you can use
Ethernet so that's going to give you the
best performance versus using wireless
all right next is using a powerline
adapter powerline provides very good
performance I mean really it's it's
right up there with wired if you have
good clean power in your house and if
you have a decent powerline adapter so
that's another good recommendation
partly wireless that is reasonable
performance okay so if a wireless
connection is preferred you can connect
your home access point and NICTA via via
cables and access either from your home
ap or from McGee via ok and then there's
purely Wireless which is basic
performance you can also try setting up
Activia as a wireless client to your
home AP by an AP client mode however the
setup is more complicated and vulnerable
to any interference in the Wi-Fi signal
ok so they give you a bunch of different
options for how to use it and the video
quality actually can scale with how good
your connection is so let's go ahead and
see what we've got in here in terms of
accessories there's a box oh wow it's a
lot smaller than I thought look at this
picture on the outside of the box looks
like huge doesn't it looks like the size
of like a big boom router but it's not
at all ok so why don't we let's check
out the accessories first oh boy lots of
different adapters so I will be needing
this one that is actually a pretty neat
way of doing this rather than create
international versions of their product
they create one SKU make sure it's not
everything you need make sure that this
is compatible with either 120 volt or
240 volt and then boom you just clip in
your thing if you're not planning on
traveling anywhere in the near future
then you just throw these out because
you clearly don't need them and you just
use the one you need ok so that's just
an AC to DC adapter and that will plug
into the neck tibia obviously I'm gonna
be having to do a follow-up video on
this one showing you guys its
performance in the real world I'll use
I'll borrow a Mac from cameraman and
we'll probably demo it on the tech tips
TV right behind me which does use HDMI
so it's got kind of a looking mirror
finish on it it's got a couple of
antennas here here we are
all right so go ahead and throw those on
there pretty neat-looking little box
actually but basically what you can do
on I'm just gonna finish up by getting
this all assembled here and then I'll
talk a little bit more about it okay all
right power button on the front on the
side you see some of the housing on the
other side you see some of the housing
this feels like it's made of aluminum
that would be my guess but you know it
feels very very solid it's got some some
heft to it it doesn't feel cheaply made
at all you got rubber feet on the bottom
so wherever you put it down it's not
gonna slip if you put it down on a cloth
then obviously it can move around it if
you put it down on something that's not
a cloth then it's not going to move
around at all all right on the back we
have our Ethernet port so that is the
way to get the best performance you can
also use that Ethernet port with a
powerline adapter that works very well
as well then we have Wireless so you can
use the wireless in those two different
ways that we outlined before do you have
a USB port so you can use that to plug
in a standard keyboard and mouse hub
whatever the case may be you can use
that to wirelessly control your Mac even
if it's not in the same room as you like
if you are using power line Ethernet for
example your Mac's upstairs boom use
that to control it and then we've got
the HDMI out and that's gonna go out to
your TV and finally we have a power in
so I'm actually very excited to try out
this product stay tuned guys and I will
be showing you the mctavey ax in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
