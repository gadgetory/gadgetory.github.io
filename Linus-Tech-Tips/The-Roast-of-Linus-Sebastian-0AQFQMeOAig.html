by madrenas coffee get the Linus tech
tips vanilla cold brew today and now
please welcome your roastmaster James
stride
good evening ladies and gentlemen
I'm James tribe and tonight is the big
night
welcome to the madrenas coffee roast of
Linus Sebastian tonight we're here to
honor a man who made hundreds of hours
of quality educational content five
years ago and has been riding on
clickbait ever since but before we get
into it I just like to say on behalf of
all those in attendance tonight and the
millions watching at home Colton that
guy joining me on stage tonight I have
essentially an entire team where every
player was picked last you guys look
like the character select screen for
that band steam game active shooter
you're like a BuzzFeed listicle for
famous virgins I'm just kidding you guys
no one hears famous bit wait is here
tonight playing himself Kyle also
sometimes plays a yellow face character
named Lyle who we all feel uncomfortable
watching but it's okay because Kyle is
part Chinese and part douchebag
he was allowed to bring a date tonight
but Paul already had plans so gamers
Nexus Steve I recognize you now sorry
about earlier man we had a mix-up where
I thought Steve was the guy we hired to
set up the microphones man if your tech
Jesus we're gonna need more nails
not to be outdone Nick light is here
tonight you may remember him from such
roles as the Adams family's Uncle Fester
oh my head is a bowling ball and finally
we have that guy Tarun Tong I'm told
you're Linus's ol boss or something
you don't look funny at all man guys
don't worry someone will put timestamps
in the comments so you can skip all the
people speaking of people who love
segways Linus is the megalomaniac CEO
who pays my salary Linus is the fast
easy way to regret ever looking up a
phone review in the first place
so you can get on with your life because
who the cares anyway just head to little
man syndrome calm and enter code Grindr
in that how did you hear about us
section so thanks for watching guys
cuz I'm fired now on a related note it's
a good thing that we're doing this roast
now because let's face it YouTube is a
fickle mistress and now the lioness is
over 30 this house of V cards could
collapse at any minute
which is why I brought these headshots
call my people we're going to take a few
pokes out Linus tonight but there's no
denying he's an icon that you should
probably drag into the recycle bin let's
take a look at the work that bookmarked
him in the first place
after this word from our sponsor gay
hockey stop her why not both am i being
manipulated to join a crusade is there
some kind of agenda
let's see if I still got it
you could always just bludgeon your
opponents over the head when you lose
hey there sexy I would like to spend
some time with you tonight we are going
out to purchase some adult sex baby
everywhere oh my god it's full of pubes
I'm a little nervous too baby
I've never done anything like this and
through all that time he never changed
his hairstyle his wardrobe or his
earrings he's like a less successful
Backstreet Boy ladies and gentlemen
please welcome the only in so I know
who's married the West Coast Shilla
Linus
oh wait wait wait wait I thought of
everything buddy you know what you know
on this okay well I noticed your feet
are dangling already so finally I get to
roast Linus
oh sorry guys uh Linus gave me some
hosting tips before the show but I just
can't do it anyway what's with all the
signing man your audience isn't deaf
they just wish they were is there anyone
who doesn't watch Lance's videos with
the playback speed cranked to 2x
seriously dude the only thing slower
than your presentation style is Nick's
metabolism I'm surprised to see you in
your regular uniform tonight I guess the
your father's suit section of Valley
Village must have been picked dry Linus
has three beautiful children but I think
it must have been test-tube babies or
something cuz there's no fucking way
this guy's not a virgin I know I'm as
disappointed as anyone that this guy was
able to breed at all but apparently he's
fixed now he says he got a vasectomy but
I think they just cut his balls right
off lately
Linus has been trying to figure out what
to do next he tried to break into acting
but he got frustrated because he kept
getting typecast as a eunuch seriously
though I gotta hand it to you and the
team for making it this far though
because your early videos have all the
production quality of an art Kelly sex
tape but with more potty humor it's a
slow burn
more recently Linus has been criticized
for the ridiculous faces that he wears
in the thumbnail images but I don't
think he can help it
in fact Yvonne told me that he makes the
same faces in bed
when she pegs him Lynas definitely has
some baggage from high school and I
think that's why he likes badminton he
can avoid the trauma of a team locker
room while still getting the bat cocks
around all night but his deepest
insecurity is that even though he's
built one of the largest tech channels
in the world the industry still treats
him just like his classmates did you
can't play with our toys before launch
you're not invited to our annual party
and if you want to play seven minutes in
heaven eventually you have to come out
of the closet all right it's time for me
to shop and get to our first roaster
Kyle handsome
Kyle's channel used to be called
awesomesauce many people don't know that
this was actually his dad's nickname for
him from way back before he was born and
who could have predicted his son has
become famous for taking a sticky load
in the eye though I think he gets up
from his mother's side
please welcome
thank you for that introduction James
and impressive work by the way I
actually didn't think Linus could sound
any stupider until you started writing
for LMG good evening it's it's good to
be here and by here I mean not sitting
next to you souls anymore all of you
i J ji I know you're probably too
embarrassed to ask so I'll help you out
Linus do you have any offer codes for
hair dye jail I'll be in touch
he probably does you're looking good
though J you know I think it's cute how
you show if your little sports cars must
be nice to actually fit in them now just
honest question do you just name your
cars after girls fat J never got to ride
Oh cuz if so you're gonna need a lot
more cars man one of the most impressive
things J has ever done is his post
Malone build you can really see how much
hard work and talent goes into making
something so precisely ugly when post
Malone stands next to that PC you don't
even see his face tats that build took
so long to launch you should have named
it floatplane hey man
man you look like you've had less sleep
than Emperor Palpatine still I get
aroused every time I see your face
because it looks like a vagina from the
70s I also love how your professional
and personal relationship with Linus is
the same he's the front end you're the
back beautiful but seriously building a
website on that scale must be a
tediously grueling process kind of like
watching a gamers Nexus video Steve puts
a lot of effort into his work you can't
tell but he's benchmarking a video card
right now I'm guessing it's up his ass
and that's why he's always angry I love
all your YouTube rants Steve did you
make one when Metallica kicked you out
of the band
[Laughter]
Steve is known in the community as Tech
Jesus but at least people believe in
Jesus you corporate a show by the way I
didn't bring my twin brother Lyle here
tonight because I didn't think any
anyone would understand him but it turns
out dennis is here Dennis I think it's
cool that during the Byrd Box challenge
you didn't need a blindfold you just
smiled Colton
that's right why are you doing that I
thought they put you up here with us
like you need to be any lower to the
ground I'm actually kind of surprised to
see you here I'm pretty sure Colton
hasn't been fired yet because lmg has a
height requirement for termination
ironic isn't it - but Colton I've always
thought you'd make a great pedophile
because you blend in with children it's
a feature so I've known linus for let's
see too long and what I've learned is
Linus will monetize anything that moves
I remember we did karaoke with him once
and he picked a song from The Lion King
I'm pretty sure that was just a Disney
ad
you realize you're sandwiched between
ads in every video right like if you
ever left YouTube for pornhub you'd have
dbrand in your ass and honey in your
mouth tastes better than you think
the wife even knows that by the way
you're at your earrings called they want
the lesbian you stole them from back in
case you didn't know lesbian is an
abbreviation for Linus Sebastian call
her unlucky but at least Helen Keller
never had to see your face or hear your
voice - his voice is proof that his
balls are the only two things he hasn't
dropped yet then again it's what made
you internet famous I really loved your
role as the 56k modem we all showed up
to Linus's roasts tonight but we'd never
go to his birthday party because he's a
workaholic the invitation would say
'come celebrate Linus's birthday monday
9:00 to 5:00 free cake sponsored by
savage jerky your funeral would be more
fun right
which reminds me when's the funeral for
Channel super-fun happening that must
have been fun though right making videos
of you pretending that you had friends
because you clearly never had any in
school that's why when you grew up you
had to hire 30 of them you guys have
really come a long way though I remember
when the profile picture for the LTTE
channel was lioness dressed up in posing
as Steve Jobs remember that yeah total
douche bag move but it still looks
better than your new logo
you and Steve Jobs do have a lot in
common though Linus may you live as long
as he did
[Laughter]
jokes aside man you're all right in my
book
you've been an inspiration over the
years and it's an honor to share the
stage of theater night thanks for having
me the roast of Linus Sebastian is
fueled by madrenas coffee get the Linus
tech tips vanilla cold brewed today
coming up lukla for any age
I still love you man Steve Burke Avon ho
and Linus himself oh I think there's no
one who deserves this more than me so
tired of all the beeps well now you can
watch the roast of Linus Sebastian
completely uncensored and get early
access to other Linus tech tips content
at flow plain calm yeah to me our next
roaster Lou cliff ranae is like a
shapeshifter who can morph to perfectly
match his job title he used to play the
hunky co-host now he plays the
basement-dwelling software day man you
look like if Luke eight Luke or if a
Philip Seymour Hoffman was playing Luke
you know I like that comparison because
these days the two of you get about the
same amount of camera time please
welcome heir to the duck dynasty fortune
Luke laughs Renee
James sir that's all you get thank you
worth any more time Terran tongue why
the fuck are you here
like I knew you from before but do you
guys even know who he is
I thought Ross were supposed to be made
up of like recognizable people I think
the rest of the people are are here at
the very least some background Terran
works at Corsair you guys know Corsair
they have a logo that looks like a
pirate ship he used to work with Linus
at ncx
I think they might have had a logo one
time that looked like a sinking ship not
entirely sir and like any foundering
vessel the rats will always get out
first
[Laughter]
Colton technically I left two so I don't
know Colton
Nick thank you for inviting me I know
Colton isn't up here anymore he got
kicked just like in every other
situation this everyone is the kind of
reward that you get for charitable work
see I handed both of these to high
school degenerates the only thing they
were ever successful at it's nice to see
something in return
also Colton you still owe me for that
computer buddy hit me up I'm gonna start
why this section with a moment of
silence that wasn't a respect of
anything that was a gift to all of you
it's probably the only silence you will
ever have with Linus in the room I've
absolutely had to get used to giving
gifts of no monetary value like that one
because Linus in all his generosity and
fairness paid me below minimum wage for
a really long time actually the first
holes the whole time I knew Taran
interesting
kinda true I had to budget about $3 a
day for food and I slept on a friend's
couch well we turned his little side gig
into the monster YouTube channel it is
today he's kind of like Darth Vader but
more like Darth helmet their dark helmet
technically from Spaceballs due to his
like overall stature wouldn't really fit
in the suit watching him get mad is
horrible cuz he's got a lot of power
like Vader he's your boss he can fire
you unlike Vader who would kill you
what's going to get frustrated however
is quite hilarious I think we actually
got a little taste of that earlier on
the big screen it's just a hyper
energized little chihuahua it's it's too
funny it's really hard to keep it in
sometimes you spend the whole first
movie thinking Darth Vader is the
biggest baddest scariest force in the
universe and then you meet Emperor
Vaughn the one who's really in charge
and I don't just mean at work by the way
I lived with him for a while make no
mistake she's the boss no question 100%
I'm even pretty sure she forced chokes
him in bed buddy I know it went down
actually Nick you kind of look like
Darth Vader but just when he takes the
helmet off machine it's the problem with
making fun of Linus for being like short
or weak or having to be hair or super
high-pitched voice etc is that there's
nothing wrong with those things so like
I wasn't gonna go that angle he can't
change that stuff what he could change
is being a terrible person but it's just
not gonna happen
one time we were hiking the second
tallest mountain in the concert he knows
where this is going so interesting it
also happens to have lightning storms on
it after 2 p.m. and we're doing it for a
land party totally makes sense welcome
to last media group so we were flown in
the last minute to save him some money
so we had no time to acclimate to the
altitude because you know sacrifice to
stormtroopers I guess and as I'm about
twice as tall as he is and consume a lot
more oxygen with my grown man lungs
I got altitude sickness pretty quickly
okay Brandon wherever he is thank you
for coming I'm not dissing Brandon
Brandon lovely he was carrying about 45
to 50 pounds of gear on his back the
entire time
I'm I'm gasping away like Nick on a
Stairmaster
Linus abandons us to get signatures from
a witness while we potentially die
lightning struck sir lightning strikes
are landing all around us right in front
of us I'm literally carrying someone on
my shoulder as we barely hobble out in
time before freakin God Himself strikes
us down Linus is just relaxing in the
car filming me as I come down is great
it was wonderful you might be wondering
he left you to die why not quit after
that see his ego is so massive that his
main hiring technique is gravitational
pull and I mean that physically like he
actually pulls people in so few people
have quit - we knew group not because
they didn't want to leave because they
haven't been able to muster up the
escape velocity that's now we're talking
about people that have a god complex
it's usually a little bit more
hypothetical he wants to write a book
about himself and beyond the potential
book DLC and like subscription model and
however else he's going to figure out
how to monetize it it's just we at this
point like sure people are gonna be
interested people talking about it for a
long time but we don't need the mind
comp of YouTube just know I need to be
one of those I'm expecting chapters like
how to create an aquarium where you are
absolutely the biggest fish getting
bullied the early years how to sacrifice
human life for fun and monetization and
Asian chicks actually super approachable
[Laughter]
well I'll over here got a vasectomy no
big deal smart move unlike anyone else
I'm not gonna make fun of that but he
did seem to really like the fact that he
got recognized he mentioned on tech wiki
he mentioned on land show it seemed like
a big deal
I do think he really liked the fact that
someone that washed his videos touched
his dick and by the way I do believe the
doctor was excited I think he was
actually quite into it but I do think
that everyone that watches your content
would just generally love to see you
sterilized on the topic of everyone why
is your panel mostly made up of your
employees it's because they're easy
targets or like no one else show up you
know they're my only friends to be fair
I'm assuming Austin Marquez Justine and
the like would probably rather do
anything on a Friday than hang out with
you considering you have no friends
thank you for delivering my fun you had
to insert yourself and steal one more
thing well you have to make everything
so damn difficult like this roast for
instance I had about a month to prepare
for this I had a very long time to
prepare for this but he's actually an
incredibly difficult person to make fun
of for things that actually matter
I had an insanely hard time with that
even then I had to crush on Star Wars
references which I think was almost half
of it and just straight-up embellishment
for which I'm probably gonna hear about
later the truth is since the first day
we've met you've always had my back
through every failure every success
imaginable both personally and
professionally no matter how many jokes
are made about your height at this event
to me you're a giant and I've stood on
your shoulders for years I'm proud that
after eight years we're still working
together and it's an honor to call you
my friend
our next roaster has some glorious hair
Steve you ever think about donating it
actually I'm picturing you bald now and
you might end up just looking like Nick
give it up for Steve Burke
thanks for the introduction James
organizing a roast like this is really
one hell of an accomplishment if you
could get anyone on this stage other
than the cast of attention whoring minor
celebrities good job really I have no
idea who convinced madrenas that
literally just the word roast that's it
was enough to make this into an
advertisement but nothing says that
Linus tech tips more than shoehorning
content into an ad what's next Linus a
barbecue is sponsored by Intel CPUs a
persecution complex sponsored by AMD
fans
I don't mention Nvidia because I am
contractually obligated to not mention
LT T's parent company it's always great
to see my mortal enemy Jay how's it
going Jay probably asked kingpin to
write your jokes tonight it's amazing
that Jay found the time to be here
between celebrity PC builds and
forfeiting overclocking battles the guy
works seriously hard I've never seen
anyone take a year to build a computer
quite like Jay post Malone's lucky he
got that thing before he died of liver
failure it's also good to see my friend
Kyle here tonight Kyle I'm glad to see
you're not busy phoning and yet another
video from your car I don't know who
will be happier when you're in a fatal
car accident Walmart or the verge at
least Lyle won't be held back anymore
Linus finally get to you I know you've
been waiting all night I'm surprised to
see you smile so much tonight honestly
it's amazing it's a medical miracle that
your face isn't permanently stuck in
your clickbait thumbnail pose
how does it go it's like you got to hold
it a little longer
oh I'm sorry take the picture so there's
an old myth that having your photo taken
would suck out your soul and based on
what we've seen of you I think they were
probably right
speaking of soul sucking experiences
they're not more depressing than
watching - a 32 year old man tried to
promote a $700 vacuum cleaner to his 13
year old audience I don't know what cost
less your sandals or your integrity it
could be worse at least you're not
Austin Evans hey guys this is Austin and
this is paying my bills this month
lioness it's it's really helpful to have
you in the industry sincerely I mean
that it just it makes the rest of us
look so good I still remember when you
tried to show the internal case thermals
lioness through a tempered glass panel
with a thermal camera you can't do that
there's reflectivity issues there's a
Mississippi issues this isn't a joke it
just really bothered me for about four
years now so you know I just want you to
remember what it feels like to care
about your job that was still friends
speaking of unfunny things house
channel's super fun doing or did it die
with your passion for computer hardware
oh that's not true Linus still has
plenty of passion he shows it mostly
when working on projects he really loves
like stealing washed-up hosts from dying
channels Riley scandals by
misidentifying tampons but it's all
about the engagement isn't sincerely
though Linus even though you peaked
seven years ago when you reviewed a toy
fire truck we really appreciate having
you from this industry you bring a lot
of newcomers into the space it's
extremely healthy I think for the rest
of the industry and we are happy to
have you in it I respect everything
you've done and everyone on this stage
except for James
[Laughter]
how many more left next up we've got
Linus's wife Yvonne ho or as I like to
call her lionesses excuse to be racist
Yvonne works with Linus so during the
height of me too I was constantly
refreshing my newsfeed because I figured
lines is a powerful guy and frankly
there's just no way that anyone could
sense having sex with him she didn't
change her name because she's a ho for
sho please welcome to the stage the one
who wears the pants and the strap-on in
the relationship Yvonne ho for that
introduction knows James everybody but
don't clap for him he doesn't deserve it
he's actually going on paternity leave
soon imagine all the whining and burping
and the farting farting that we won't
have to deal with in the office anymore
[Laughter]
hmm
anyway um sorry excuse me I'm just uh
I'm trying to look out into the audience
but I'm a little distracted by the next
bald spot they're like a freaking beacon
I could use the shine off your forehead
to like guide ships home from the sea
can you just tilt your head up a little
bit yeah thank you that's better that's
a better look for him anyway yes I am
lionesses wife and yes lioness has a
wife we've been together 14 years too
long and have three kids I used to tell
people that I actually had four kids
because Linus is a bit of a late bloomer
I guess I should have expected that from
someone who peed his bed till he was 15
years old I told you that in confidence
[Laughter]
he was a trust-building exercise we're
still waiting to see if his voice will
ever pass the puberty stage now a lot of
people actually think that I married
Linus for his money
but when I met Linus I was studying
pharmacy on my way to a six-figure
income and he was flunking out of school
jobless and had horrible pink hair pink
it was gelled the same as it is now - I
think he spikes it to look taller
because I can't think of any other
reason why he would do it we don't know
it doesn't look good he actually didn't
drop out of school till he made me
promise to take care of him huge red
flag ladies but it wasn't the financial
dependency or lack of prospects that
worried my mom no she pulled me aside
and was like honey he's really short if
you're wondering how romantic line is
this you obviously have never met him
and you probably know nothing about him
but his idea of romance is taking me out
to Red Robin and reading me a story
called everybody poops and lighting a
scented candle while I sit and watch him
play video games she told me that was
true that's all true that's true
that just happened last week a lot of
people ask me why I married Linus yeah a
lot of people wonder that it's good that
I married him before he got famous
though right otherwise I'd have to
compete with all these fans out there
just kidding you only attract men after
we got married though Linus did what a
typical guy would do he asked me to have
a threesome
well waking up in the middle of the
night to find Dennis in our
in Vegas was what I had in mind this is
also a true story I'm sorry Dennis there
were budget constraints I'm sorry Dennis
but ugly really isn't my type I'm just
kidding
you're beautiful on the outside a lot of
people have a problem with Genesis
accent but I don't I say keep practicing
and eventually one day you'll say
something intelligent a lot of people
don't know that I actually started this
company with Linus and even helped him
in the NCIX days but he just took credit
for all my ideas my labor and not only
that but he made jokes about paying me
with sexual favors why is so naive men
like you don't pay with sex they pay for
sex speaking of taking credit for other
people's ideas though a bit Rick Kyle is
here and when it comes to running his
YouTube channel I'm not sure he's ever
had an original thought he's copied us
every step of the way he even hired his
wife to help that's our awesome sauce
we're not mad that you copy us though
it's okay you shouldn't feel bad steve
copies us too he's got the bad fashion
and somehow even worse hair kudos for
doing something better than us though I
want my conditioner back MJ you're
actually one of the people I follow on
Twitter I really like some of your
colorful rants but I just want to share
some advice that I'm always giving -
acting like a giant dick doesn't make
yours any bigger
[Laughter]
speaking your size back when I was
pregnant with my third child I thought
Luke might be too actually used to live
with us when we started LMG he was
really messy when he moved out he left
the biggest grossest stand on the floor
in the room now we have our two year old
son and boy it's nice to have someone
who's actually potty-trained he's bought
his own place now though huge grass it
was an estate sale meaning he bought it
from a dead guy he's so cheap that he
took the dead guys couch his chairs his
cutlery even though that guy's bed
that's true amazing deal all jokes aside
though the dead guys stuff is a huge
upgrade now people ask why does lmg have
so many people so - can have friends
when he wanted to go on vacation last
year he paid for 20 other people to go
and called it a mandatory company
retreat some of you might not know but
Linus is actually really concerned about
getting dadbod but hon you don't spend
enough time with the kids to qualify for
that now I haven't actually been with
many other people or actually any other
people besides Linus and that's probably
for the best because it might be more
disappointed I say more disappointed
because I do have fingers
Oh on summer nights Linus gets so sweaty
that he soaks the whole bed and it's
basically the only time he makes me wet
yeah joke's on you fifteen wasn't the
last time in all seriousness though you
know I love you you know I think you're
wonderful you're my best friend you're
my business partner love of my life
thanks for letting us poke fun at you

good guy he always give his promises

his favorite thing is firing people but
cotan what mister here and this is so
bad acting I'm so happy and you never
like push to it your acting career if

going to Oscar this is the closest you
can get there's a well-known rumor that
Lana's gay

mean I don't think no one your gay
community we fucked something like this
I mean I would rather fuck look James
sure Riley David came out three all the
sales team is that Conan the contractor
coop you're the kitchen set
but now Steve you look too much like a
woman from the back I'm nine two daddies
so Yvonne so I can promise you that your
marriage is secure
speaking of secure Linus is insecure why
ever since Lance got his vasectomy
because I've been like so secure like he
always carrying this orange screwdriver
round and pocket so he has a big come on
Linus nice try
in fairness I've been carrying that for
ten years oh we do you get picks ectomy
that early Lana's sinus Lance is like an
annoying irritating bossy smelly bitch
is short bad breath why talented ten
last ugly pretty ikurou voice that that
you never wanted except for his money
which he never gets you anyway he is so
fucking cheap he will bring us out for
dinner but he would never pay for drinks
not even anything so let's be size
screwdriver is there any coupons in your
pocket oh you know what's in my pocket
oh dang again oh I got this ten yen from
my cocoa refill here is this you know -
you owe me an apology you know why
because I'm not interesting your tech
videos I'm not interesting your cpu GPU
fuck you it's like having your video
it's like having a thick knife like like
it's just like only my eyes oh fuck but
it's also I'm like a talented caring
nurse and all I do was like wiping ass
this is Odette
your bill guy words there's one time
you're watching a pill guy idea tried to
peel computer I finish before I drop it
I look down why the fuck my wearing
sandals and socks well - you are a nice
person I'm really thankful that you
pinned my wall if I broke your ceiling
[Laughter]
our next roaster has got to be the
oldest guy in the room if Linus is tech
dad J is tech grandpa if if if Steve is
tech Jesus J is tech Methuselah I'm
trying to express myself here if if
Linus is at the height of his career J's
dead lion Sanjay you guys should really
do more collaborations though because
you guys are actually a pretty good team
J has the temperament of a child and
Linus has the body of a child put them
together you get one complete grown-ass
man make some noise for perhaps the
first creator eligible for youtube's
retirement pension beta J's two cents
okay we're here to obviously hang out
with someone who's got a face for radio
any voice worthy of mute I am of course
talking about lino Sebastian but before
that we've got a few people here that we
need to go ahead and address in the room
Kyle I want to congratulate you on the
dream of homeownership big boy cars big
boy clothes why don't you buy a fucking
brush I am sick and tired of watching
your videos and see that you're just
like I've got the messy thing going I
mean you're one fanny-pack away from
fucking hits hipster of the year okay
Luke I like you better without the beard
seriously you look like a fucking
unshaped vagina too pissed when James
said it cuz had you shaved I would
realize you just look like a shave
vagina Steve so we talked recently about
we don't watch each other's videos
because we're too busy until recently I
found out yours are the perfect solution
for insomnia they're so fucking boring I
cannot make it past the intro like I
never see the ad cuz I don't make it
that far
[Laughter]
Dennis hi I have no idea what you
fucking said in that last side I'm sorry
I've been in the studio I've watched
some I have no idea what you're saying
and when I go to Taiwan it's like I'm in
the land of Dennis's I have no idea
what's happening seriously so but but
but you're sweet and I yea just smiling
not wryly I don't know you know I've
seen you you're you're pretty much as
white girl as it gets for being a dude
and when NCIX tek-tips went under I was
like yes I had to see this hooker
anymore and then Linus hired you yes
yeah James James James we went back and
forth on this I didn't know how deep I
should go like how hard should I go I
didn't know and he kind of was like okay
your SATs okay it's a good start you
know but we really want to see like a
verbatim script but we use a different
system recomm
it's called talent so I'm kind of
clicking the thing but you know
something really looking at it right I'm
looking at you because we don't need
that but it makes you feel better I'll
keep flicking the button lioness though
I'm happy to see that nobody held back
because I was concerned really honestly
wait who should have held back with your
dad I'm just saying
Linus literally looks like a sock puppet
without the hand I mean look at it look
at the hand in there the other hand is
in the other end but you know whatever
there's something be said about a man
who only wears his own brand though
right I mean think about what you're so
fucking conceited you have to brand I'm
surprised you haven't sold the sweater
and started putting sponsors and stuff
on that and don't use that idea because
I'm probably gonna do it myself but in
but in terms of looks and stuff though I
mean you can't really help that you
can't help the fact that you look like a
steel skeleton wearing wax paper for
skin maybe by comparison pounds but you
know at least I can lift more than five
pounds so we've also we we've all seen
those screaming goat videos though right
I mean literally that's what I hear one
of your videos come on
I don't know Avon what the fuck I used
to think okay Linus has he's got a good
business he's I knew you were farmers
he's you know go to pharmacy school when
all that sort of stuff and I thought
okay well maybe she realized like this
is a white guy going somewhere and work
you just said none of that had anything
to do with it you married him when he
was a deadbeat or you got with him he's
a deadbeat you had to take care of him
you were the one going somewhere he has
a small dick what is wrong with you I
don't get it I don't get it but that's
okay that's besides the point
I mean Linus can't control things like a
statue his voice but he can control his
fucking fashion sense so I'm off the
cards now guys sorry so anyway we we
recently were at Austin Evans wedding
and somehow I don't know how this
happened we got into the conversation
about saw quality I wish this were a
joke we're sitting there and like
waiting to get into the reception and he
goes on about like champion sucks you
know whatever this brand is good this
rands bad I wear them out in badminton
yeah I mean never thought I have a
conversation with some
talking about sock quality while playing
badminton but this guy for like 15
minutes went on and found a brand that
cost a little more but has a lifetime
warranty I realized he knows more about
socks than anything tech related yea
1997 called it wants its hearing backs
apparently with the lesbian from earlier
I don't know something like that but
Linus is cheap he told me - he only goes
to places that he can get all you can
drink iced tea he told me once he drinks
so much
iced tea that they double charged him
and when he called him out on that he
drank more than apparently all you can
drink because he's that into iced tea
the speaking of drinks madrenas you
don't even drink coffee it is he will
put his name on anything with a dollar
sign behind it and this is evidence of
that he recently showed in a sponsor
spot one of his live streams that he
didn't even know how to make it and then
he said that if he drink coffee he
assumes it tastes alright so if there
was a if you want to talk about
Schilling and people who are willing to
put their name behind anything this is
it I mean I was thinking you know it's
nice of Linus to pay for all of us to
come up here and I realize Lance isn't
paying for this if there's ever been any
/ more overwhelming proof though that
Linus will shill it's literally this
event right here but you know talking
about shilling and that kind of segues
into the whole concept of you have a big
team you need to the sponsor spots to
help keep everything afloat because
there's big overhead there's big
expenses you did a live stream recently
from your phone talking about every year
you kind of have to address this topic
why is LMG so big why there's so much
staff it's because it takes 27 people to
lift your but there's anything I've ever
learned about small limp-dick terrible
haired earring wearing sock warranting
sellout like Linus is that anybody can
literally make the dream come true as
long as you're willing to pay people to
make you look like you know what you're
doing - and all seriously though I
appreciate you you showed me
that even with a voice like yours you
can go somewhere online so a huge thank
you I respect you and everything that
you do and thanks for inviting me
I know Linus cares about the environment
because he uses recycled hosts Riley
Murdoch you were definitely raised in a
cul-de-sac a I was if god's a software
developer your as MVP Minimum Viable
personality please welcome the product
of hitting go on a basic white guy
generator
thank you James
you said some mean things about me but I
know he's joking because this is a roast
normally it's kind of hard to tell
because his face looks like he just
stepped in dog yeah some people have
resting bitchface
James has resting serial-killer face but
it's actually a trick because he's
actually really got a soft heart he's an
environmentalist he single-handedly
started the recycling program that we
have at LMG he's a vegetarian
you know he loves the world just not the
people on it I bet he would love
actually if half the population got
wiped out like today just to see less
trash in the landfills he's not even
there I have to sit here and take it I
was gonna call him a sick eco-conscious
bastard there he is yeah
well that actually works right and
really well into my next joke he's
basically Santos you know legitimate
interesting character complex
motivations but at the end of the day
it's just a big purple dick see me I
love the world I love that we have so
many wonderful Roasters here Steve Burke
from gamers Nexus Steve is a critical
thinker a gentleman and a scholar but
you wouldn't guess it because he looks
like a cro-magnon man
not many people know this Steve is
actually a bit of a scientific marvel
yeah he was conceived in a lab using
ancient sperm trapped in amber oh maybe
that's why you couldn't convince the
verge or a real journalist me Steve me
expose Intel scandal lowly dot whole
thing
it's just not gonna happen man why can't
you get it through your hair lukla
Frannie a is here tonight is out you see
her name I don't know I think so Luke's
old nickname was slick but I could never
really bring myself to call him that
when his wardrobe consists entirely of
shirts that he can get for free at PAX
alright work or at work but don't get me
wrong I appreciate the aesthetic you've
curated you know you look very happy
very contented like you've just finished
your third hungry-man TV dinner
people say Luke and I look related and
you know maybe it's true you know maybe
we're triplets the other one
Dennis Lau is here everybody he's the
main editor for Tech link the news show
that I write and host and he's also a
magnificent angel look at him I know
this is a roast I know he said some mean
things about me but could you ever say
something nasty about such a pure spirit
look at him he's like a delicate forest
sprite a being of light and perfect
goodness Oh Dennis
can we get Dennis anything do you need
anything
I just wanted can you give him a drink
can you can someone get him yeah please
he deserves all the goodness in the
world oh sweet sweet sweet boy sweet
Dennis no one ever can hurt you I will
stop them bless you Dennis Kyle you man
I'm sorry I'm sorry that was a reflex
you see when I was making videos for
NCIX Kyle was doing the same thing for
our main American rival Newegg so he is
still legally my nemesis and we've only
met like twice I'm sorry Kyle Karla's
his own channel of course formally named
the relatable and excitable exciting
awesomesauce Network and then you
changed it to be tweet I mean--but would
it sounds like the fifth Teletubby who's
too stupid to make it on the show so
tinky-winky and dips he had to leave him
in the namby-pamby forest yes I googled
the names of the Teletubbies for that
Kyle's had a bit of trouble with the
verge recently aka the real journalists
they took down his Lyle characters
response to their shitty PC building
guide because they said it infringed
their copyright and featured a racist
character because he did a Chinese
accent now Kyle is Asian okay but I can
understand the confusion I mean it looks
Mexican and his last name is Hanson I
mean I hear his full name and I think
and we're also being graced tonight by
the presence of Taryn Tong from Corsair
Taryn also worked at NCIX as we've heard
nice to see you escape the Gulag man and
look where he ended up you know a
featured presenter at an amateur comedy
roast for a minor internet celebrity but
the real reason we're here tonight
everybody the third most famous Linus
Linus Sebastian now although I've only
worked for Linus for about a year I
actually worked with him back at NCIX
I don't remember much from my time there
only some vague flashes come through you
know a high-pitched whine cutting
through the office like a hot knife
through hair gel a glimmer of light
reflecting off not one
but double hoop earrings in both ears
why - why do you need so many I don't
think he can even remove them now I
think there have been infused into his
nervous system and I'll never forget
this the distinct aroma of dippity-do
hardening into a jagged hellscape of
spikes very affordable yes unfortunately
it was 2013 and hair gel hadn't been
cool for like 10 years
seriously though everyone's style kind
of crystallizes at some point usually in
adulthood but you were 13 and you were
like this is it only this but that's
what we love about Linus isn't it he
doesn't flip flop around with the trends
in fact he never wears flip-flops only
the thickest sole sandals with the
sturdiest velcro those things are not
coming off no matter how much of Vaughn
bags legend has it that beneath those
straps his skin is entirely translucent
[Laughter]
yeah Linus looks less like a successful
business owner and more like a 1990s
Circuit City employee
why would I move out of my parents house
I'm saving money I don't have to cook
and I can even have girls over if I
leave the door open okay but really guys
we all know Linus is actually an
incredibly hard-working creator a
dedicated husband and father and an
inspiring leader I can't thank him
enough for fishing me out of that
dumpster last year and what he's built
in Linus media group is nothing short of
astounding I mean you've got a huge
studio hundreds of thousands of dollars
in equipment and close to 30 employees
now I think we can afford a stylist
that's it
the roast of Linus Sebastian is fueled
by madrenas coffee get the Linus tech
tips vanilla cold brew today up next
Linus gets the last word he deserves to
be roasted he doesn't deserve the roast
so I hope he leaves here a little bit
sadder than he came the closer we get to
it the more I'm terrified
this next roaster is someone who
definitely needs an introduction I just
met Taryn Tong for the first time
tonight when he tried to sell me DVDs on
the sidewalk definitely representing
Corsairs official position
please welcome Taryn Tong
so I'd like to thank head gamemaster
Seneca Crane for organizing this event
tonight just so you know editions or
downstairs on the casting couch
[Laughter]
hopefully I see the view count is high
enough tomorrow see still a lot of jobs
[Laughter]
when I usually see Linus it's at some
sort of trade show where he starts
waltzing in and because he's been famous
he starts breaking so tonight I'm like
well this is the first time in 15 years
he's invited me on any one of his shows
so I'm looking around and what can I
break I'm sort of thinking something
grand like the camera boo because
nothing says no nothing says view house
like human tragedy I mean don't tell
your old friends about it after the show
yeah speaking of internet-famous
it's finally nice to meet some Michael
Cole Roasters by watch long wine Jay
from Chase to science Steve from capers
Nexus Kyle from bit with what is a bit
what kind of sounds like you know a head
injury that you get after you take one
too many shots of the head do you guys
for finally William Hung if we all get
through this night you can might come up
and do our encore she bangs then there's
a five Benchwarmers from leader- Media
Group billion for the other youtubers
who had better sense no techy tease
sometimes us unfairly criticized for a
lack of diversity but what I feel
tonight is that we can yes we can show
the world that we can in very slight
diversity that we like we have the
frontier
this robot claw Sonny was named Dennis
taking a break from devious tree turning
tricks no representing China even though
he's Taiwanese official communist party
doctrine says it's other way around then
all the hardware that James put into
organizing this so I like to give him
one day slow claps after months and
months of preparation he managed to find
one not to just one woman to participate
and that's Linus his wife forever dude I
mean it should be it should be a simple
pitch right you know come out have a
couple drinks of the few odors joke
about internet culture no joke about
technology with the biggest group in
tinsel is west of the Rockies
if this isn't progress I don't know what
is your Vaughn just bit of advice keep
that rape whistle and pepper spray ready
and later when I tell you you run you
just run but you had your chance to
speak now at the wedding Jay first time
we're meeting tonight even though my
employer possibly my former employer
depending on how the rest of the night
goes that's working for several years
recently I saw a really touching episode
where she answers a call from the
make-a-wish roundish and he's building a
PC with a kid who got shot with cancer
no terrible thing but be straight with
me
where were you really their first choice
I mean what was the selection process or
like going through YouTube videos and
they're like fuck this here the two of
them up good thing they didn't check and
see how long it takes them to finish a
build
but series is a really good stuff I mean
it shows you know the power this
community and the heart that we have and
it makes us all appreciate that we're
all relatively good health except for
Nick he looks like he's about to go in
for a lobotomy tomorrow or maybe he's
having a coronary I mean with those
times are you trying to hide one of
those and timely boners we have been
sitting around for a little bit longer
than we probably liked the lights a
little bit warm to try to fight it but
you can't so just roll with a buddy
[Laughter]
cheese phones for one trophy and
humanity doesn't really end there though
I mean I understand that he brought
Steve from gamers Nexus with him tonight
because Steve wanted to be on YouTube
channel that was somebody watch out
there as well but don't worry Steven
everything C says is true about you your
hair is dreamy you're just big-boned
real catch and you know what for some of
you has such strong opinions about cable
management the hair but really really
unfroze will be here when Linus asked me
to come up I thought was a wonderful
opportunity to support the LGBT
community I mean just look at this
transformation but they made from a
socks and sandals wearing lesbian to a
proud possibly gay men looking forward
to have been taking a story rejection
last I hear that Denis ago help
volunteer administer
so you can go from his twelve-year-old
girl like nasal voice to and Elizabeth
Holmes like baritone well hello this
account right be log your journey will
be good I think will be pretty brave
hashtag courage display all the grief I
get - before today today tomorrow
he's preserved he's made it and he's a
decent human being
Kiril deep much more deeply about
employees and has a lot more emotional
depth than his a crappy videos may
suggest - today is a more introspective
version of the dumb kid I met years ago
you know mastering his negotiating
skills the vendors by telling them ahead
of time that no we have no intention
opinion I wish him more cells more views
and more successfully used to come
thanks for having me
our final roaster is Nick light just
think if all those years ago Michael
Jackson had had your face today there be
no controversy guilty please welcome the
guy who shows up with a bat if you
thumbs down a line this video
all right wow what an introduction from
the guy who's attempting to look like
Bruce Buffer
after all these roasts something a
little a bit more like Bruce but hurt so
we'll try to get past that I'm really
happy that I get to share the stage
tonight with some of my awesome
colleagues like Riley you know as you've
heard tonight Riley's motivated he's
enthusiastic and boy is he positive like
seriously this dude is weirdly positive
this may be a bit far-fetched but some
days I wonder if Riley might secretly be
a serial killer
I could easily picture you just standing
in your kitchen frying up a bunch of
severed fingers and saying time for the
quick bits maybe maybe you'll enjoy them
with a side of good gravy
and Luke Luke of course as he alluded to
earlier without him I probably never
would have even heard of Linus tech tips
never mind actually working here but
Luke is the best type of guy to be
indebted to his memory is so bad that he
can't even remember to show up on time
for the wine show you know the show that
has started at the same time every week
we were like seven years so I feel
pretty safe in knowing that there's no
way in hell he's ever coming to collect
on that day Vaughn you're great too but
one thing that I absolutely can't stand
is how and us indecisive you are
sometimes I can't even imagine what it
must have been to deal with you when you
were a pharmacist you know you'd be
calling your patients back all the time
take one of these no no take two take
two take take four and then they never
called you back because by the time they
got the final message they were dead on
a more serious note though I would never
impersonate a generic Asian accent
unlike some people on this stage but I'm
personate Dennis all the time because
Dennis is the absolute king of
unintentional one-liners my absolute
favorite one happened in Vegas one time
you know we're all chilling in the room
at CES we're catching up on emails like
11 p.m. and
all of a sudden dennis barges through
the door obviously drunk and just says I
lost all my money and another time in
Mexico we were on some random jungle
excursion Denis looks over into the
distance and spots this huge hole in the
ground
and he points to Colton and he says hey
Colton the reason why you're here is so
I can put you in your grave and I'm sure
I'd have many many more examples of that
if only I could understand half the
words that come out of your mouth and
who can forget our esteemed guests the
three guys who had nothing better to do
on a Friday night than fly to a
different country country to take part
in a bootleg marketing event for a
coffee company hosted by the troupe of
man children who brought you such
classics as arctic hobby land rider 503
RC firetruck unboxing and first look
Linus tech tip yes that is the full
title of Linus's most viewed video and
yes this is the moment where all of you
should be seriously reflecting on the
life choices you've made that have
brought you to this very stage Kyle the
man the myth the bit whip
Lyle's just better I'm not even making a
joke that's just Steve or as he's more
affectionately known tech hey-zeus maybe
if you smoked as much weed as your hair
makes it look like you do you'd actually
make an entertaining video I'm honestly
really quite surprised that you showed
up tonight all of the famous people here
already don't know how to build their
own pcs at least when Linus decides to
make a six-part video series the
audience already knows it'll take over a
year to complete and land with fake
excitement and speaking of Linus who can
forget the reason we're all here tonight
mr. Linus Sebastian
Linus media group Linus tech tips Linus
cat chips this guy really doesn't take a
whole lot of himself
I actually heard that Linus wanted to
have five kids that way he could start
the names with L I and you and they'd be
like the Power Rangers except instead of
truck joining together to save the
planet
they'd have to fight to keep their dads
fragile ego intact after he gets old and
looks a whole lot more like I do for all
the hater we see online it's actually
pretty easy for me to look past all that
clickbait titles and shitty thumbnails
they've given me the perfect title for
my future tell-all book the many faces
of Linus Sebastian a series in 12 parts
and in addition to the many faces of
Linus there are many sides to Linus it
well as well so at work he's running
around like a man on a mission he's got
a screwdriver in his pocket he's lifting
heavy servers but then you get to the
badminton court and he's moving
elegantly and he always makes sure to
have his balance hand out when he goes
up to smash that cock I mean shut
shuttle cock show cock why don't we just
call it a birdie I only like him because
he makes me money I guess I just had
that down as a note but even with all
the things that we can harp on you know
your height your voice the way you just
drag on forever
the bottom line is that you promote
curiosity creativity and hard work and
tech content that is second to none
you're fantastic influences on the lives
is everyone here and everyone watching
at home and I want to say thank you
ladies and gentlemen it's time for the
rant you've all been waiting the man
that YouTube only puts on trending to be
ironic
Linus Sebastian that was I was hard
[Laughter]
honestly it wasn't quite as bad as I was
expecting they'll believe it or not
that's actually the first time Nick's
ever said anything nice about me
honestly guys I didn't think bad Apple
had a single kind bone in his body
though in fairness to me you can't
really blame you it would have been
pretty hard to find a bone in there yeah
you're smiling the fat joke Steve I mean
at least you didn't call me a pathetic
corporate shill by name when you did
your mock vacuum cleaner review yeah
it's pretty quiet I guess you guys
didn't see that video that's okay you
really didn't miss much it's kind of
like the rest of these videos really
King like here's the thing I might have
an irritating voice but it beats putting
the entire room to sleep every time I
open my mouth then there's this tech
Jesus thing like what is that I'm always
hearing yeah he's tech Jesus meanwhile
I'm sitting here going yeah no that
can't be right
I mean for one thing Jesus had 12 whole
followers
and for number two he eventually came
back from the dead you ask me he's more
like tech weird al' that's without the
accordion or a personality yeah laugh it
up Kyle but I mean at least Steve's
videos have substance I mean I was
chatting with your BFF Lyle the other
day and I think he put it best he goes
okay rook he call himself
awesomesauce but he looked more like
sweet-and-sour dork you two stupid even
for the verge if it's been higher your
racist Real Talk man you have any idea
how offensive that voices to people what
no no I can do it I'm like half Chinese
on my wife's parents I'd at least unlike
you guys Jay knows something it's off so
Jays an expert when it comes to milking
celebrity appearances for YouTube views
I swear to god man
how many parts was the post Malone built
you got your part one you got your part
two you've got your oh my god it's
finally working thank God oh thank you I
was like gonna make that video dude it's
a computer just King build it thank God
he didn't leave you a review on Yelp
yeah my brand-new computer was outdated
six months before he delivered it more
like Jays too slow
[Laughter]
and there's you sorry who are you again
right right Oh VP of Sales of course
their memory Oh Big Shot douche you know
he's lucky that they never checked his
resume every company he has ever worked
for has gone to get you know everyone
you know before he settled into Hocking
memory modules he tried to make it as a
tech reviewer remembered a neo seeker oh
yeah exactly right why all right his
most recent victim NCIX so if that's
anything to go by
I'd say submit your Corsair warranty
claims get your rebates in because it's
the pile of dead bodies is anything to
go by I'd say they got about another
three years
which reminds me Riley for three years I
tried to poach this guy from them so hey
you know Riley lmg is a pretty cool
place to work
oh yeah wow that's neat maybe I was
better off without you you're clueless
fuck he's so nice and sincere you can't
be like maybe this is an underhanded
recruitment attempt
anyway NCIX finally folds and I sent
over a proper job offer and what do I
get back oh you know I really want to
but my wife isn't sure if she thinks I
should do it oh you want mate either
you're whipped as fuck
or you use your wife as a shield either
it's a bad luck which brings me
perfectly Luke where do I start with
Luke how about before I even met him
guys have can liar you know
probably the biggest one was actually on
his resume so it was only years later
that he finally admitted that his only
experience in video production was quite
literally a keyboard unboxing that he
made in the kitchen with his mom did you
know he's actually the only reason that
we implemented a dress code at our
company that's right we it's a really
simple one where actual pants because
nobody wants to see a giant meat print
sticking out of your flannel PJs I know
what the dick swinging was about though
it really could not have been easy for
you having the stature of Batman with
the status of Robin back to wearing
pants though
my wife now we've heard already a lot of
people say well she must have married me
so that she could spend my money but
come on guys you got to think critically
that's obviously not true because if it
was the first thing she'd have bought is
a pair of breasts like honestly hon if I
wore as much padding as you just think
of it what an innovation I could just
like no it's great
we're actually shopping the other week
was adorable so she's all excited she
finally found something that fits right
and I go honey nobody hit the Isle for
adult women who's over there right
honestly I don't even know why I'm
laughing at this joke because the jokes
kind of on me I mean we're done having
kids so it's not like she needs them for
anything at least my wife can use power
tools though you think I forgot about
you so this guy invites me over to see
his new apartment on a Saturday and I
get there
and apparently he expects me to paint
his walls and mount his TV you know
you're fucking useless when you trust
these butterfingers more than yourself
to handle your expensive electronics I
don't know I guess I don't blame you
though I mean so I asked this guy to
hand me a drill because I'm working on
things for him he goes oh I'm not a
drill person is a dresser a man a table
would you believe this guy served in the
Taiwanese military thank God China never
actually invaded James look at him over
there he's all like he's sitting in the
throne oh you know my roast isn't you
James
do you James this is your one chance to
be in charge enjoy it big man I know
that's what you really are
textbook small dog you're always talking
about your big dick energy last time I
checked man your hands ain't much bigger
than mine I mean okay sorry just to be
clear about one thing I'm actually not
saying that that's an indication
oh you guys were all here when my wife
was up oh you know that's actually
pretty easy coming up with mean things
to say about me his voice is so high his
balls haven't dropped honestly by
comparison
coming up with mean things to say about
you guys was really hard for me before
tonight I accept James James you enjoyed
this movie seriously though I think this
is the part of the show where I thank
you all sincerely from the bottom of my
heart for being here I know that this
was absolutely a ton of work for all of
you you guys were amazing by the way you
also put a lot of trust in what is
admittedly a gaggle of idiots to pull
this all off means a lot so as much as I
want to say that I absolutely meant all
of the mean things I said I love you all
enough to start bottling them up again
tomorrow
[Laughter]
