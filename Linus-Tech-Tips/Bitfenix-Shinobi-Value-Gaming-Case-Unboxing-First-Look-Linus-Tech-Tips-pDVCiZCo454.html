at by oh I should say by popular demand
because whenever I do get multiple
requests for a product unboxing I do say
that I try to this is the BitFenix
shinobi which is a more value oriented
case from NYX they do have other cases
including their Colossus which is a very
high-end case but this is more meant to
target those mainstream gamer type folks
so this one there's it's available in
two versions there's a window version
and then there's an on window version we
have the non window version there's
actually a diagram here showing you what
it looks like with the windowed side
panel versus what it looks like without
a windowed side panel as you hope you
all know what a non windowed side panel
looks like at this point in time though
we've got maximum expansion okay that's
what they have to say for themselves
BitFenix soft touches surface treatment
which is actually pretty cool I have
seen it in person before efficient
cooling tool free design for the window
version only that's interesting and ok
let's let's open this thing up and see
what it has to show for itself so say
for a new case here I got breaking all
the seals because that's what I do I
break seals like I don't Club seals I
just break them haha not not funny
because I'm from Canada I know okay dump
this guy out and see what we can see I
wonder if I've actually made that joke
before Bob seal I mean I've done so many
of these videos at this point that it's
hard to keep track of what I've said and
haven't said what I can and cannot say
just kind of roll with it and if I make
the same joke twice well then hopefully
you guys will forgive me
and I don't have a subscriber rebellion
on my hands or anything like that so
there it is that is the shinobi I'm
going to go ahead I'm going to do that
360 degree rotation thing again which is
something that I never do but this case
is fortunately reasonably light and it
doesn't have super grippy rubber feet on
the bottom in fact let's find out what
it does have on the bottom because I'm
curious now oh look at that
so just metal punchouts on the bottom so
I might move around a little bit but I
mean honestly once you load this up with
a system it should have some more weight
to it it's only light right now because
it's a bear case so let's look at
external features first white only so
the first thing we got here at the front
is three five and a quarter inch base
nice little brushed metal bit Phoenix
logo there and we've got some
ventilation holes down both sides
actually we've got ventilation rolls
down both sides and all up the top and
then finally we have what looks like a
dual 120 mil vent also on the top we've
got four USB 2.0 ports headphone and
microphone ports as well as power and
reset and this is that soft touch feel
finish that I was talking about before
this is kind of up what can I just how
can I describe it it feels kind of like
a rubber that's not sticky so like if
rubber had a bit of a powder on it so
that it doesn't stick as you move your
hand across it okay on the side panels
themselves you've just got your standard
powder coated painted metal finish and
this screw is difficult to remove I will
use a screwdriver sorry about that guys
got that taken care of now so these are
thumb screws here so they're probably
only tight because they're put in at the
factory um if you okay
if you put them in by hand every time
then you'll be able to remove them by
hand every time so we can't call that
tool list although the Fenix doesn't
even claim that the non windowed version
which this clearly is because there's no
window clearly well that is to say
it would be clear if there was a window
on the left side panel so we've got the
case opened up let's do the back first
why not here we've got our three five
and a quarter inch bays I can see here
that the two list mechanisms are removed
from the three and a half inch bays of
which there are one two three four five
six seven eight Wow outstanding eight
three and a half inch hard drive cages
which our tool is on the windowed
version and not tool this on this one
and then we can also see a CPU cut out
at the back of the motherboard tray
that's for installing large bulky CPU
heat sinks without taking the
motherboard out installing a backplate
putting the motherboard back in and then
installing the heatsink you can just do
it through the back we've got some cable
routing holes and we've also got
adequate space between the right side
panel and these cable routing holes here
so you're going to be able to actually
run a 24 pin cable out to the side of
the motherboard and an eight pin cable
up to the top probably have to route it
through here without any clearance
issues at the back so let's actually
here speaking of the back let's look at
the back of the case where we have a 120
millimeter cooling fan we've got a IO
port we've got eight expansion slots a
couple of these water cooling holes
although these are very very small these
are probably only going to accept
thin-walled 3/8 tubing or thick-walled
1/4 inch tubing we've got our power
supply mounting here and that is a
bottom mounted power supply with a
couple of things that are exceptional
about it one of which is that it is
filtered so there's a filter right here
which can be quite easily removed also
we've got four little rubber mounts here
which will keep the power supply raised
off the bottom of your case a little bit
to ensure that it is able to suck in
some fresh air without any difficulty no
matter which way you mount it we've also
got a 120 millimeter fan intake here
which isn't going to be able to pull in
a ton of air through that mesh that
filter and then finally the fact that
the case isn't that far off the ground
but it will provide some additional
intake air for your graphics card area
although I would say that's probably a
very optional fan to install because
right here at the front of the case
we've got two 120mm fan mail
as well so that's going to take care of
most of the cooling needs for anything
that is behind them I'm going to go
ahead and see if I cannot and move this
without too much difficulty okay that
wasn't supposed to happen
either way here you can see the
removable fan filters here at the front
okay you can see where you can all this
is neat so you can actually install a
three and a oh that's an interesting way
to do that it's not damaged at all hey
we win yep we're good so you can see
here that we can use this as a three and
a half inch front drive bay installer if
we want to see that's got the soft touch
finish on it and then you can do two
more five and a quarter without any
difficulty whatsoever all right I'm just
going to put that away for now anyway
and we do have clearance at the front
for those 120 millimeter fans so those
go on the inside here next we've got our
internal cables which are all black love
to see this even though the case is in
windowed it has a full black interior
including black cables black connectors
on the ends of things and that is
awesome so we've just got our front
panels for your power you reset all that
good stuff to front USB cables and a
front audio cable I think that pretty
much wraps it up at this point in time
doesn't it I don't see any kind of a
dedicated two and a half inch drive
mount although correct me if I am wrong
about that how one thing I haven't
mentioned though is the fan mounting
options for the top so you can see that
we can either do dual 120 millimeter
fans or dual 140 millimeter fans in the
top so this case in spite of the fact
that it looks very clean I mean remember
once we put the front panel back on
which hopefully is easier to put on
there we go once we put the front panel
on it actually looks very clean and very
sharp but we can install 101 to 140
millimeter fans we can do one two three
four 120 millimeter fans in this fairly
modest little case so thank you for
