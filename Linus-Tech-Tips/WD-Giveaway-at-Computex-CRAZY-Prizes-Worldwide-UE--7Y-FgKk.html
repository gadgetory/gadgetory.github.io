coverage at CES
well Western Digital remembers them too
and they are sending us to Computex 2013
to do Show coverage again so we thought
well we want to make a really
professional video talking about some of
the exciting stuff that has to do with
our trip to Computex so then we decided
to make this instead nothing else really
seemed appropriate given the
ridiculousness of all the stuff we're
going to be giving away in collaboration
with WD to celebrate our trip to
Computex to cover the show now there is
a bit of a catch WD is gonna have a
crazy booth at the show this year and
we're going to be doing five videos one
per day on June 4th to 8th and the more
views those videos get the more crazy
insane stuff we get to give away once we
get back from the show now when I say
crazy I'm not talking like your average
run-of-the-mill crazy I'm talking
climbing a cat tree in the middle of
your living room and then dive-bombing
onto a mattress crazy if we get 25,000
views average on those 5 videos we are
going to be giving away 5 my passport
ultras as well as to my book studios if
we reach 50,000 views whoa well then we
get to give away to Western Digital one
terabyte velociraptors to four terabyte
Black Edition drives and to three
terabyte red edition drives but wait
there's more if we get 75,000 views per
video average then we get to give away
to puget core i5 gtx 660 gaming rigs
now I still have an actually safety
thing about how you win these prizes
once you unlock them
but don't worry that information is
going to be in the lightest tek-tips
forms red linked in the video
description under this video but I
haven't even revealed the grand prize
yet if the videos average a hundred
thousand views each we get to giveaway a
full-blown Steger dynamics gaming grade
media you see this media PC has an
overclocked 3770k 16 gigs of ram a GTX
780 graphics card it's also got a 250
gig Samsung 840 boot drive and 4wd 3
terabyte red drives in rain now state
your dynamics is a pretty young company
and they contributed the system for us
so you don't have to do it to win but go
check them out on Facebook like them on
Facebook we're not gonna spam your wall
or anything like that and we're
certainly not gonna give you any videos
to watch like this just some cool posts
about the latest technology and it would
mean a lot to them I'll see you guys at
Computex don't forget to check out the
videos and as always don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from our
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
