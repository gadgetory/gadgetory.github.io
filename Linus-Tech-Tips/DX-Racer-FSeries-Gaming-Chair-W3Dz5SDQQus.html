covered gaming chairs before well
actually we've only covered one gaming
chair before unless you count this Soria
excuse for a video and the message from
you guys was definitely clear we want
more coverage of gaming chairs so here
we are with our coverage of the dxracer
F series a smaller gaming chair for well
smaller people ensure swift victory with
Corsairs highly responsive lightweight
gaming mouse the Sabre RGB click now to
learn more a piece of furniture is
always going to start with the packaging
and assembly experience isn't it the
chair arrived well padded with
closed-cell foam and no visible damage
after having been shipped to once to my
shipping location in the US and then
again to me in Canada very nice and the
manual is small but clearly illustrated
and translated into nine different
languages a reflection of DX racers
global presence with shipping
distribution centers and localized
websites all over the world it only took
me about 15 minutes to put the chair
together not including the time that I
spent fidgeting about with the camera
and while it confused me for a couple of
seconds when the only baggie of hardware
I could find contained an allen key and
a single set of bolt washer and lock
washer when I figured out it was just a
spare and the others were pre-installed
in the holes where they're ultimately
going to end up I was like that nice
touch
like that it means no guesswork and the
lock washer and regular washer
orientation and bolt locations are all
pre-configured for you finishing touches
were a piece of cake snap on the plastic
guards for the back rest supports put
the little orange accents on the
aluminum base it's actually apparently
been tested to support up to a ton even
though the chair itself suggests the
maximum load of 265 pounds just watch
the orientation it's thickened to the
outside so your foot rests on it a
little easier then slip the optional
head pillow over the top and thread
through the clips for the height
adjustable lumbar support and you're
ready to rock and if the point of buying
this chair was feeling ready to rock
then I guess you couldn't have done much
better I went with the black and orange
color scheme because I thought it looked
very Linus tech tipsy but it's actually
available in a variety of different
all of which look extremely sharp around
the tubular steel frame that includes a
lifetime warranty if you ever worried
you might actually break the frame of a
chair you'll find a high-density cold
cure foam wrapped in a polyurethane
covering which has a somewhat leathery
feel to it but is waterproof the dxracer
logo at the top is embroidered digitally
and my bald friends will be happy to
hear this if you opted to leave the head
cushion off and lean back in the chair
you'll be pleased to know that the
ex-racer is used a nice soft thread for
the stitching so it won't chafe and I
guess soft is a good transition word for
this next bit compared to the last
gaming chair that I checked out the foam
in the dxracer F Series is noticeably
softer making it hug my butt and give
way to my back a little bit more as I
sit in it for my personal tastes this
would be good if my usual sitting
position was a little less upright and
more slouchy because the angle of the
foam where the backing meets the bottom
seems to lend itself to a more reclined
posture that has your butt further
forward on the cushion with the back
kind of spooning your curved spine this
is reinforced by the presence of a wire
in the bottom of the seat that can be
actually easily felt through the cushion
if you scooch too far back when you're
sitting straight upright I hoped the
lumbar cushion would help with this even
though generally I prefer not to use
them and even though I found it does a
good job of staying in position it was a
bit too thick to be practical for me but
normal and upright isn't the only way
the F Series can be used the chair has
most of the usual adjustments height
adjust is handled by the gas lift lever
on the side and goes much higher and
much lower than I would ever want as a 5
foot 6 inch bloke and you can also use
this lever if you want to lock the Rock
functionality just by pushing it in
rocking tension can be adjusted with
this knob from the from difficult to
push back to pretty easy to push back
and the contoured arm rests are nicely
shaped for your forearms and our height
adjustable to 9 different positions with
ergonomic release and lock buttons
positioned underneath the side of each
of them finally the chair can be safely
reclined with over 20 usable positions
so far back that you can basically lie
flat in it
the ex-racer also points out that you
can actually use the 12 degree Rock even
if the chair is lying flat but I don't
know if I'd recommend it it's not that
you'll actually fall over it's just that
your head will be lower than your feet
which leads us to the conclusion this
chair is not directly comparable to the
last one I reviewed because it's
designed for use by someone with a much
smaller frame but instead of having the
ex-racer send me their m-series
something that would be more equivalent
I asked for the f-series hoping it would
be the final answer to the question of
which gaming chairs for me unfortunately
I don't think this is it it's definitely
a personal preference thing but I think
a more level black cushion design with
firmer foam but the same size as an
f-series would be grand if I could find
such a thing so my quest for the perfect
office / gaming chair is not over yet
but let me know what you guys think do
you prefer a more relaxed sitting
position or a more upright one I mean
did all the things that I complained
about sound just dandy to you let me
know in the comments below and also let
me know if you want to see more chair
videos speaking of more videos without
sponsors like our friends at mass drop
we'd have a hard time making them now
wouldn't we today's featured drop is the
VAR mule ova 87m a pretty darn cool ten
kilos mechanical keyboard it features a
solid metal body like actually made of
metal with a cool artistic design of
your choice Cherry MX switches and
either die sublimated top printed or
laser etched front printed PB Tiki caps
they did not skimp on the materials for
this keyboard and is pretty top-notch
stuff from a relatively small keyboard
maker now I guess right off the top of
this spot we kind of assumed that
everyone knows what mass drop is but if
you don't there are site that
facilitates group bys ensuring that you
can get great deals on stuff like new
tech clothes tools and heck even t if
you're into that sort of thing items are
nominated and then selected by the mass
drop community and then mass drop works
directly with the manufacturers and
distributors to find a starting price a
lowest price and a bunch of prices in
between that for each product and then
each lower price gets unlocked as a
certain number of people commit to buy
the aforementioned product there's a
referral link in the video description
that leads to the drop for
for meelo keyboard that does not give us
a commission but does let math drop know
that we sent you so head on over there
to get the full details on the pricing
and duration of this drop and be sure to
take a look at a round on mass drop comm
