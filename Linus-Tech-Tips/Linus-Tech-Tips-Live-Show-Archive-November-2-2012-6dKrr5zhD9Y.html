hope that I figured out the audio
tonight because if I haven't figured out
the audio tonight that's gonna be a real
problem for me I'm gonna go ahead and
hear you guys can even watch me do this
part amazing I am setting the video to
public to announce that the livestream
is starting now I don't need these
anymore I'm just gonna check out the
twitch chat really quick here and make
sure that everything is hunky-dory on
the audio side saw a flicker of liveness
Wow
hopefully this is working I have
actually I I don't know if this is
unwise or not but I have actually turned
up the the streaming bitrate for tonight
so hopefully everything is okay but
there's no real guarantees about that so
here we go I'm just gonna go ahead and
expand the twitch chat so that when
we're looking at that or Twitter we can
have a clearer idea of what's going on
there we go all right so good evening
everyone we've got a fantastic show
planned and by we I mean me because I'm
the only one here and we're gonna start
with I am on Facebook now sound hold on
hold on hold on apparently there's a
problem
sound is quiet does anyone else have any
complaints about the sound before we get
started
someone says video and sound is great
tonight someone says sound is quiet
sound is fine sounds really quiet sound
is good okay those of you with the audio
low I have a Linus tech tip for you
you're gonna want to find that dial or
that button on your computer or on your
device and you're gonna want to turn
that up because if we've got some people
saying it's good and some people saying
it's not so good then rather than rather
than be obnoxious and you know turn the
volume way up for those of you who it's
already fine for in like breaking your
ears let's go ahead and get the rest of
you to turn it out no I can't pan the
camera but what I can do is I can move
myself here and then the chat box will
be here and then we can all see what's
going on
so let's start with a little bit of Q&amp;amp;A
before we get too much further into this
and let's take some questions at Twitter
Oh Oh check this out check this out I
set this up whoa on Twitter at Linus
tech actually you know what I shouldn't
have put that there I should have put
that on the actual on the actual one
that I'm using for Twitter so I'm gonna
go ahead and add that I I know I'm I
fail that graphic design and this is
this is not very good but there you go
I'm gonna put that there that way there
can be no confusion about how to ask me
a question on Twitter I'm not taking
questions on Facebook tonight although I
am now on Facebook you can reach me at
my uh my - tech page there it is with my
epic how do I hide my min control panel
there he goes finally you can see my
epic picture of me and FPS dog that was
about four years ago I think at this
point at Fraga Palooza and then because
you guys were trolling me so hard with
the do you even lift bro meme I decided
to look it up at the end of last week's
livestream so now I have a picture of
myself flexing and it's captions know
that I cleverly understand the internet
name and all that good stuff so here we
go yeah so basically my facebook page is
just a clone of everything that's on
Twitter so if you don't follow on or if
you already are following on Twitter
you're probably not going to see
anything else there I mean the thing
that I like about Facebook or maybe the
baby wants to visit us for a little bit
tonight the thing I like about Facebook
is that the posts are a little bit more
persistent which is very convenient
because the thing about Twitter is I can
tweet something and if you guys are
following like a billion and one
different people on Twitter then you're
gonna miss a lot of a lot of the stuff
and I get a lot of questions like I'll
say hey guys live stream starting in an
hour and then I'll get like six people
tweeting back at me when does the live
stream start and it's because they don't
really see it so if you follow on
Facebook then it'll be a lot easier to
keep track and and that should be less
difficult for everybody so my baby has
decided to join us again tonight
although he's a little distracted he's
getting started on his solid foods now
so it's night II had some peas which was
very exciting for him he's staring at
the screen he doesn't know how
look at the camera yet but don't worry
we'll get him trained up he'll figure
out how to do this whole camera
presentation thing a little bit
squirming tonight but okay let's take
some Twitter questions cuz I did promise
I'd do that so 36 new interactions what
happened to the cabling guide what do
you know what happened to okay you know
what you might have to go sit with mom
okay ah cabling guide nothing happened
to the cabling guide in fact if we go on
the youtubes then I'm sure we can find
the cable guide and cix cable management
guide featuring ultimate AMD system with
162 thousand views so that is how you
can find that one
Devin needs help to overclock his
toaster Devin you are beyond help I'm
sorry there's nothing I can do for you
for a boot drive and some key games is
it worth paying $35 more for the Intel
520 series or get a vertex for 128 great
question for a boot drive in some key
games I'm of the opinion that pretty
much any modern SSD and by modern SSD I
don't mean like failed super low-end
modern SSDs like like an agility 4 for
example but any modern SSD a performance
oriented drive you probably won't notice
the difference day to day between that
and any other drive so would I pay $35
more for a 120 gig drive with the way
that 120 gig drives are priced these
days I probably wouldn't however I don't
know if I'd necessarily go with the
vertex for 128 either I would probably
lean towards a samsung 830 if you can
still find one or an 840 or something
like a crucial m4 just because I don't
know if you've been paying any attention
to sort of the stock market news with
ocz but you know they're going through a
bit of a rough patch right now and it's
one of those things where if anything
did happen to ocz yeah you got a
five-year warranty on that vertex for
how do you claim a warranty if they
don't have any more vertex cores to
provide to you so I don't know I don't I
would probably go a different route hey
- why does everyone say go Intel when
you look at an AMD cpu and the gigahertz
and cache is way higher for less money
Roman it's because Giga
in cash is totally meaningless take
everything you thought you knew about
gigahertz in cash and throw it out the
window you see that window right there
that's where I would throw it because it
doesn't matter it doesn't mean anything
what matters is the actual real-world
performance of a product you can never
ever compare one CPU to another one
based on gigahertz in cash unless
they're using the same architecture so a
great example of this was back in the
core 2 duo days you could find a 40 360
360 600 and then I think there might
have been a different there were four
CPUs that were identical in terms of
architecture and frequency manufacturing
process except for the cache that's the
only time when you can kind of do some
benchmarks and figure out how they
perform compared to each other and truly
evaluate the value of cache in terms of
performance and then when it comes to
gigahertz totally meaningless unless
they're using exactly the same
architecture with the same amount of
cache so don't worry about it Intel CPUs
are higher performing particularly for
gaming and that's just the way it is
whatever the spec is don't have context
for this but ok greetings from Croatia
hello thank you for watching live that
is fantastic
jacob asks will there ever be a
warehouse sell in ontario actually there
was one once i'm not sure if they're
planning another one anytime soon but
there was one poach 'men asks what is
the best sub $70 headset I have a good
receiver I can't really think of any
headset that I'd probably recommend in
the sub $70 range once you get up to
around 100 bucks you're looking at
something like an Asus bulken or a steel
series 7h those are both excellent
headsets but anything sort of at that
price range is going to be not that
great the TSS hosts my favorite 680
custom cooler honestly I don't have one
I'm more of a water cooling guy so I buy
water block
gentiemen iran asks do I know a good
Canadian ISP that offers bandwidth
reliability and speed personally I'm
using shock I like them a lot better
than Telus a little be options are
completely different in these so that
might not be relevant for you at all my
card keeps crashing when I unplug one of
my displays asks or proclaims Bartek
Bartek
why are you unplugging your displays I
guess what I'd recommend to you is keep
your display plugged in it's possible I
mean okay more serious more serious
suggestion it's possible that something
shorting out when you're unplugging and
plugging it in so you might want to try
being really careful make sure your case
is correctly grounded yeah it's possible
there's something going on it's possible
that it's a problem on the actual
monitor side itself and that's what's
causing the short and then that's what's
shorting your card and causing your your
computer to crash or whatever else so
you want to try that monitor on a
different PC see if it still happens try
that PC with a different monitor see if
it still happens that'll help you
diagnose the problem - I have a 6770
with an inch of extra plastic on the
shroud can I lift it off so it fits in
my Dell yeah go for it I'm assuming you
mean at the back of a card if you can
just saw it off as long as there's no
heat pipes but you're gonna cut actually
yeah I saw like I'm gonna see I'm gonna
see if I can find this because it's it's
fantastic oh yeah we don't want that
let's just go ahead and toss that we
don't you don't need that at all so let
me let me see if I can let me see if I
can find a heat pipe cut off images I
don't remember where I saw this but
someone sent this to me where they take
in something like a thermal right 120
extreme and then to make it fit within
the side panel of their case they had
cut off the entire top because they
figure it oh it's just the little nabis
at the end of the heat pipes that are
causing the case to not close anymore
and of course heat pipes don't work at
all if they're not full of the fluid
that gives them their heat pipe
fluidness and yeah it's sort of it sort
of made me laugh so there you go that
reminds me of that just don't cut up any
heat pipes on the laptop I was holding
was a nice arrest
seven and I'm gonna talk more about it
later in the livestream it looks
absolutely fantastic
Federico don't do a secured race unless
you have to
the thing about security racing the
drive is that it actually writes to the
entire Drive which will wear out your
drive period it will the hay asks what I
think of the Nexus 4 Nexus 7 I am a
resolution guy so the more resolution
that you can throw out a problem the
better and I'm super super stoked on
something like a nexus 10 has a more
powerful GPU than we've seen before in
high resolution tablets the one thing I
don't like about high resolution tablets
right now particularly the iPad is that
it runs significantly harder and has a
way worse battery life compared to the
previous generation product so I'm
interested to see what Apple can do
about that with the iPad 4 but as an
iPad 2 user I have had zero desire to
upgrade to an iPad 3 like even if
someone was like I will trade you and
iPad 3 for your iPad 2 the way that the
iPad apps are getting written it's not
like there's a performance advantage or
like there's certain apps I can run on a
three versus a two so maybe it's a
little smoother but the chip in the iPad
2 is already pretty darn fast so I don't
actually care about the performance
Delta and then for the resolution side
you don't use it as an e-reader and I
don't like how hot it runs and I don't
like how crap the battery life is so
what do I think of the course are 200
are good question Christian or Sarah 200
are let's see if let's see let's see how
high up I am on the list I am the first
hit so if you would like to know what I
think if the 200 are you can search for
course are 200 are on the YouTube and
you can find my video and you can watch
it that pretty much covers everything I
think about the course are 200 are it
looks just outstanding them Christopher
says well I liked it much better
watching you here on Twitch that's good
someone's complaining about the echo you
know what there's nothing I can do about
it right now just because my mic setup
doesn't allow me to get it any closer to
me which would help us reduce the echo
since you always talk about it what's
the best budget sound card the answer I
always give is whatever is the zonar
card
in your price range so there's the D
whatever it is D something
yeah the D G is the best if you're gonna
use headphones cuz it has a headphone
amp and then if I was gonna get
something that I were I needed 7.1 then
something like a D s is gonna be sort of
so much better than onboard that it just
blows it away whereas if you actually
have a decent pair of headphones like a
well like a really nice pair of
headphones then you're gonna want to
step up to something like an ST or and
STX or a Phoebus and then if you want to
get a better experience running 5.1 or
7.1 speakers something like a DX would
be a better choice greetings back to
India of course I'm getting a new PC for
editing and rendering console gaming
videos how much RAM would you recommend
honestly unless you're doing anything in
After Effects anything with complicated
color correction like DaVinci Resolve
anything where there's a particular need
for a ton of memory there's no reason
why you can't just use Vegas movie
studio and render videos with for any
case around so what I usually recommend
for people who asks me about RAM is buy
whatever you're comfortable with so in
this case these days it's probably
better to go with like a 2 by 8 gig kit
and then if it doesn't work for you add
another 2 by 8 gig kit and thumbs up now
you have enough RAM so you I mean Rams a
commodity item it doesn't really go up
in price except when it does but it
hasn't done it in a very long time so
buy what you think you need and then go
from there and this goes for any
application I mean people ask me this
all the time I want to play I want to
play modern games I want to play
upcoming games I want to do this I want
to do that how much RAM do I need ran
this one of those things where past a
certain point is there an iPad 4 already
I don't know I haven't looked at
anything I'm sorry I don't really pay
that close attention to Apple anyway so
gaming wise people say oh you know I
want to play this game or that game or I
want to do this Ram doesn't affect your
performance past a certain point in
terms of the frequency with the
exception being actually AMD's APU
processors when you're using onboard
graphics so I have a video about that on
the NCIX channel
and see x8 to you it's actually worth
checking out that's faster Ram really
matter this was a really cool video
because what I found out is by upgrading
from slower Ram to faster Ram we were
able to get like deep double digits
performance improvements like you know
20 30 percent performance improvements
using the onboard graphics so that's one
case where it matters but on most gaming
machines it really doesn't make that
much of a difference and then when it
comes to the RAM capacity speed because
that's all there is there's there's
latency and speed which are kind of the
same thing they're very related
and then there's capacity capacity will
make literally zero difference unless
you need the realm so if you are able to
take everything you're doing and store
it within your realm then the system the
CPU whatever it is has easy access to
that data and it's all going back and
forth really fast and everything's good
if you have a data set that's larger
than your memory and it overflows to
your page file that's where you see that
choppiness and that crappiness and that
slow performance or even crashes so you
either have enough RAM or you don't have
enough RAM and it's really easy to
figure out what you do is you open up
task manager you look at your
performance tab and if you have five
gigs available like I do with this
machine obviously I could be running
some more camera angles or I could be
running some more screen captures or
whatever else I need to be doing in the
background and then once I ran out of
ramp then I would have a benefit or I
would see a benefit from actually
upgrading the RAM on this machine so a
good question and I hope that that was
helpful to someone all right I don't
have a sound card thinking of getting a
corsair 1500 yes it's a good headset for
an on sound card setup it's better than
onboard but it's nowhere near as good as
an actual sound card I know I haven't
really looked too closely at any of the
k9d giveaway videos I have a look at a
couple of them and honestly the ones I
looked at we're sort of terrible I said
right in the video don't just like you
know rage out and smash your keyboard
because you're getting most of the
judgment is going to be based on
creativity for those of you who haven't
already already
this I would actually you should check
this out welcome to I'm doing a giveaway
if you just go to my channel youtube.com
slash - tech tips I'm giving away some
Corsair k9e keyboards five of them to
the top five video entries video
responses the theme is nerd rage and
what I said right in the video is doing
what I did is not creative and I'm
judging you based on creativity so don't
do what I did and then probably a good
three quarters of the first kind of 20
or 30 responses which were what I looked
at were people playing a game raging out
and breaking their keyboard and I'm just
like that's exactly what I did what are
you doing but my other PC keeps beeping
three times in a long break I know it's
a memory era but how can I fix it David
it could be anything if you have an on
board if you have an integrated memory
controller and your CPU could be dead
CPU could be a dead board could be dead
memory so without sort of swapping those
parts in a note and diagnosing it that
way there's not really a whole lot that
you can do can you recommend the minimum
requirement for PC for recording editing
and rendering Andrew it's really hard
for me to do that unfortunately because
it really depends on how you're going
about it I mean sorry I'm gonna walk
away for a second here something like
this in which case the spec I'd
recommend would be very different
because this has a built-in encoding
engine that just doesn't really require
any additional performance on the part
of your PC in order to to stream videos
online like on Twitch or whatever else
the case may be so if you do that then
you spend an extra $200 on that but you
might save some money on your CPU for
example and then for editing and
rendering it really depends what you're
doing if you're doing more complicated
stuff but it's a completely different
set of requirements if you're doing
really simple stuff then it's a
completely different set of requirements
the reality of it is though almost any
new modern PC with you know an AMD FX
processor or an Intel Core i5 and up
sort of a quad core is going to be
pretty suitable for basic use and almost
anything it's not like you know back in
the Athlon days when you know you bought
an Athlon single CPU machine
for sort of you know if you were
browsing the Internet whoa the internet
or you got an MP machine with dual
processors when you were gonna be doing
serious work it's not really like that
anymore because almost every computer
has multiple cores in it now and so much
RAM that it doesn't even matter David
asks which keyboard do you use I use a
me onyx disciple 60 I really like it
although I'm seriously considering
switching over to the g7 10 plus from
Logitech because those brown switches
are pretty good and I do like the
additional features that are available
on it compared to visible 60 hello to
Belgium what knife do I use for my
unboxings and where did you get it I got
it at House of knives at Guildford wall
and it's a spider code bug little little
knife very handy not sharp at all
anymore like yeah at all but but it's
perfect for cutting packing tape which
is exactly what I use it for I have not
used this headset but I've heard
fantastic things about it so based on
how many recommendations I've had for
this headset I'd say yeah it's probably
pretty safe to to go for and check that
out so I'm gonna transition into one of
my one of my topics here for the night
and let me just switch back to my to my
general view so yes right I am on
Facebook now so I I know I might have
mentioned this briefly before but yes so
officially I am on Facebook now so you
should like me on Facebook and tell your
friends to like me on Facebook and
honestly it's not it's not an ego thing
for me it's just a matter of if it's
more convenient for you to follow on
Facebook because you don't use Twitter
I've had a lot of people complain
Twitter oh no one twitter twitter
twitter is not as evil as you guys seem
to think it is and I do like to answer
questions on Twitter you'll see here on
the Facebook page it says do not send me
private messages here Twitter only and I
have people message me on Twitter and
say minus a hundred and forty characters
isn't enough I need to write you this
novel so that you can answer all these
questions for me and I kind of go
yeah man you know I'd love to do that
but let me show you something like
that's pretty you know let me show you a
cool story bro moment here because if
you need to know why or if you like if
you're having trouble figuring out why I
can't answer really the Twitter page is
not gonna let oh here it is why I can't
answer all of all of the questions that
I get if they're all you know essay
length all you got to do is do a search
on Twitter for at - tech to give you
some idea of the kind of volume of
messages I receive and reply to so I
think sort of tweets all I don't know
yeah I think there you go so how many
how many messages does - received sort
of this many and if Linus tried to reply
to all of these and they were all at si
this long as opposed to being 140
characters how quickly would he die the
answer as you can plainly see is very
quickly on top of that I have the
messages that I get in my inbox on
YouTube I have the messages that I get
in my email and it's just not doable I I
mean I have people send me a big here's
my list of specs - what water cooling
stuff should I buy it I'm just like yeah
you know what it's part of the rite of
passage of becoming a water cooler to
just do the research and figure out what
to buy I had to do it you have to do it
and the reality of it is I used to try
to reply to all of those messages even
the ones that are like I don't want to
do any research whatsoever I need you to
tell me what PC to buy so I'll send them
back a spec list and then they argue
with me and they're like oh well my
friend told me that this is better I'm
like yeah I you know what it was already
all I could do to reply to this in the
first place I'm not gonna argue with you
back and forth about it by the extreme
edition if you want it doesn't matter to
me go for it it's not my money so I just
I got to the point where I just didn't
really sort of care anymore
whereas with Twitter you ask a quick
question I send a quick answer I might
reply again I might not I try to I try
to read most of them even if I can't
reply to all of them so that's why I
like Twitter most of the updates on
Facebook will still be because I
have the two apps tied together see I
just have like Twitter integrated and so
there's stuff like this so if I upload
something to YouTube it automatically
ports to Twitter which then
automatically points to Facebook so so
that's pretty much all I'm using it for
just just other ways to other ways to
interact on other ways to keep track of
what's going on so it looks like a few
of you like me yeah that's how are you
body made myself birth thank you Irene
Internet so I appreciate that thanks
guys
oh right you know what that actually
helps me transition into what one of my
other topics for the night is going to
be so I don't know if you guys have seen
this already but intel has a new extreme
edition so the fastest is now faster
again and it's the i7 39 70 X so we're
gonna go ahead and search for that on
the youtubes and that we can see that
there's a review of it or start selling
or yeah you know there's probably no
reviews cuz they probably don't care um
I got a couple issues with this number
one is that they've increased the TDP
again which to 150 watts which I guess I
don't really care it probably doesn't
really matter probably doesn't run that
much hotter because the reality of it is
it's the same TPU
as the 3960 exits Bend a little bit more
it's a little faster it's 200 megahertz
faster at stock speed but if you were
buying a 30 960 X and you weren't
overclocking it then you're probably on
the bottle so in terms of the actual
temperatures and the actual performance
you're gonna get out of it it's not
gonna make that much of a difference I
would have loved to see a 39 70 X that
was an actual eight core processor with
16 logical course using hyper threading
but that's not what Intel opted to do
here so I just wanted to take this as an
opportunity to talk a little bit about
the value proposition object stream
addition processors because I get people
asking me all the time whether it's on
Twitter or the ntx forum or on
email or whatever else should I get a
3930k or should I get a 39 60 X and to
me the answer is very simple I mean the
reason I'm using a 39 60 X in my machine
is because I got you know the reviewers
discount on it it's not like because I
actually spent a thousand dollars on a
CPU I don't think that that's a very
compelling value I mean if you're
already spending five thousand dollars
on a machine and you're getting 3-way
SLI and you're getting 32 or 64 gigs of
RAM or whatever whatever you want to do
and you want to go for an extreme
Edition you know what if leave sort of
the e-peen factor is worth it to you I
say go for it but personally that's
never really been how I rolled I mean
the CPUs that I've actually bought in my
lifetime are gonna be twenty five
hundred plus I bought myself a thirty
five hundred plus I splurged and bought
myself a 44 hundred plus x-two back at
launch that was the most expensive
single CPR single computer component I
ever bought it was seven hundred over a
dollar seven hundred eight hundred
dollars at launch because I really
believed in dual core and then after
that I got myself in eesti 600 which was
a much faster dual core then I picked
myself up at Q 6600 so these are that
should give you some idea where I was at
I was always buying sort of that value
that value but with the full unlocked
features sort of skew so 3930k I think
is a compelling value if you can
actually leverage the additional threads
whereas 3970 x i'd say you're better off
buying yourself a 3930k now if you must
have six-course by yourself at 3930k now
and then wait for the eight cores that
are coming with with ivy bridge-e which
is coming sort of not that long from now
as far as I can tell all okay it's not
seen but it's not forever from now
either so so yeah right so we're okay
right right right so people ask me sort
of you know thirty nine thirty okay what
do those go for a 3930k goes for around
six hundred bucks would you spend almost
double for what basically amounts to
here we can extrapolate all the data we
need from something like an anon tech
review on the thirty nine sixty X
because there's always a review of the
extreme edition
okay so 39 60 X so let's assume that a
39 70 X is going to be I don't know 10%
faster let's say although it's not no
it's not even close to that it's
probably more like 5% faster so 39 60 X
is conveniently not on the same graph as
a 3930k well whatever let's compare it
to a 2600 case so even if our new CPU so
2600 K is you know 5% or 10% faster than
this we're talking about 3770 which is
you know it's probably better to look up
to 37 70 oh that's a preview what there
we go the review they've probably got a
39 60 X on here so bla bla bla bla
really okay there we go
so let's look at gaming performance just
for lols 3930k there we go so
thirty-sevens if your gaming 3770k are
35 70 K which actually performs almost
the same it's definitely your best bet
is an extreme addition a good value the
answer is always no however it is
exciting that Intel's at least you know
pushing the envelope a little bit
further in terms of performance and
trying to deliver more performance for
for gamers or for whoever needs an
extreme addition except that for gamers
overclocking at 35 70 K balls to the
walls
is going to be a cheaper platform for
one thing because you get a z77 board
instead of an X 79 board and you only
have to buy you know two dims a memory
in order to feel like you're getting the
most out of your system although x79 can
run dual-channel just fine and the
performance is very similar to
quad-channel because of the reduced
latency that counters the lost bandwidth
so you get a cheaper platform you get a
cheaper chip you get the the benefit of
like I've always found more frequent
upgrades are better as as a gamer or
someone who wants to get sort of the
best bang for their buck because if you
buy that super expensive halo part and
then something new comes out there's
always going to be like the way it
always works is there's always a
replacement that costs half as much and
performs the same as the last generation
one whereas if you bought that part that
cost half as much but performed 85
percent 80 percent as well but obviously
you're losing less of that value when
the new parts
so if you want to sort of recoup as much
money as you can by selling that stuff
and then buying the new good value
proposition part with the next
generation then you can actually take
that budget you would have spent on a
thousand dollar CPU and stretch it over
many generations where you go okay let's
say my budget for a CPU is a thousand
dollars I'm gonna buy myself a three
hundred dollar CPU today and then in a
year I'm going to sell that CPU for okay
let's say a hundred and fifty dollars
let's say it loses half of its value
which they don't twenty six hundred KS
are still worth more than half of what
you paid for it so I'm gonna sell that
for half what I paid so I've essentially
spent only one hundred and fifty dollars
so far I'm gonna buy a new CPU for $300
I'd spent four hundred and fifty dollars
now and it's a year later and that CPU
performs better than that one I would
have spent a thousand dollars on then
let's say I'm gonna sell that CPU let's
say I lose another 150 bucks I buy a new
CPU for 300 bucks now we're two years
down the line we're talking two
generations better performance and I've
only spent $600 already so when people
ask me how do I configure the most
future-proof gaming ring sometimes the
answer is spend a little more if they're
saying oh I have $600 to spend I need
the best gaming rig I'll say look you
are getting terrible value by spending
$600 on a gaming rig because you're
getting parts that are costing $100 but
performing a quarter as well as
something you could have spent $200 on
it would last you longer and will have
no resale value because nobody buys used
crappy hardware like it's just asinine
like if you have a GT 440 or something
and you're gonna try and sell that a
year or two later oh it's a gaming card
oh it's Kepler no one's gonna want that
so so yeah there's not that sort of that
middle of the road where you need to get
to a certain point before you're even
getting a decent value but then when
people say oh I think you know if I
spend twice as much of my
future-proofing more the answer to me is
no because you could use this machine
for two years put that money in Lincoln
I don't know
GIC savings account and then spend that
money again a year or two down the road
and get way better performance and then
you'll have two machines and you can
give the other one to your little
brother or something so so they're my
take on the value proposition
an extreme edition and I am super
excited however for when Ivy bridge-e
comes and we actually get more cores on
our extreme editions because as a video
guy I actually care about more cores
whereas for you gamers out there it
actually just doesn't really matter so
let's do some more Twitter questions
shall we what do you recommend to use
Ram disk for honestly I've never really
tinkered with Ram disk as someone who
uses 8 SSDs and raid 0 I don't really
think that my application loading times
they're that limited by Ram yes it could
be faster it'd be cool to use around
disk for something like a scratch disk
in in like a video editing or photo
editing software however you need a lot
of system ram for that it'd be cool to
use a round disk for certain key
applications I'd love to load my OS on a
ram disk but it's just I just assume
throw more SSDs up the problem because
they're not even that expensive and Ram
disk is still cost per gigabyte very
expensive I bought any suits STX s
sennheiser HD 598 and the sound quality
is not that different from my ex 79
rampage for extreme that is the first
time I've heard that the same 95% of the
people like AD making that number up but
I have a lot of people who tweet me and
tell me I bought a sound card it's the
best thing I ever did I can't believe it
yeah I have no idea how that sort of
happened about but I'm very sorry if
that was based on my recommendation what
laptop are you running right now for the
stream I'm actually not running a laptop
right now this is a this is a monitor
see so there so Samsung mother it's a 3d
monitor it's compatible with AMD HD 3d
which I would never use because it's
just not very good compared to 3d vision
but yeah Ryan seriously this was my
topic like a month ago he's talking
about a green light program with Nvidia
but thank you for your contribution Ryan
what SSD would you recommend the cost
between $50 and 150 Australian dollars I
have no idea man I'm sorry no idea guys
just as a sort of just recommendation if
you want to ask me for product
recommendations within a given price
range do a little research on your own
find a product that you think might be
appropriate because that'll give me
context as well rather than saying that
costs between you know a hundred great
britain pounds and 200 great britain
pounds it's a lot easier for me if you
say I'm looking at a Corsair you know
Neutron GTX is there anything else you'd
recommend because that already tells me
what kind of a price range you're
looking at and it means that I don't
have to think about the currency
conversion if you must give me a
currency value give me like Canadian
dollars or US dollars which are the ones
that I can that I can easily think in
that I already know sort of what things
cost you know if I was building a
workstation I'd probably go Quadro or or
GeForce but probably Quadro for CAD not
oDesk
just based on what Diesel's telling me
about how awesome CUDA is I've never
really experienced it myself because I
don't really do any sort of that kind of
stuff I let other people do that but he
says it's like a big deal and it's like
awesome I like your leather couch oh
that's cool thank you Christian
greetings back to Australia hey Linus do
you recommend upgrading from an AMD 1100
t to an FX 8350 if you can get a good
price for your 1100 t if you can like
get a few bucks back for it then
actually that's not a bad upgrade but FX
8350
unlike the 8150 is actually tangibly
faster than the 1100 t so so it's not a
bad upgrade however you're not seeing
much more than sort of a 1 generational
performance increase the 1100 t is six
sort of full cores whereas the FX 8350
is four piledriver modules which is sort
of almost like four four like each
module is kind of like one and a half
core so it's almost like six cores which
is sort of the same as what you have
from before except the clock speeds
different and the IPC is a little bit
lower somebody asks if I'm unboxing an
EVGA SRX I do not have any plans to
unbox one of those they're very
expensive and I don't want to open one
just for the sake of opening one and I
don't have any CPUs for them anyway so
it's not like I'd be able to do a build
in it it's not a very practical platform
anyway it's not overclocking friendly
which means that yeah
can load it up with Korres but really
it's a workstation board posing as a
gaming board because if you can
overclock 3770k is going to absolutely
destroy an EVGA SRX with the highest end
Xeon CPUs so it just is one of those
things where it's for bragging rights
but it's not really a practical platform
for really much of anything if I was
going to build a workstation like Ora
like a server I'd use a proper
workstation or server board that doesn't
even pretend to support overclocking
that much my friend just built his first
PC yesterday when he tried turning it on
the monitor had no single signal what's
wrong with it I have a great video
called no post-diagnosis and no probably
helps the whole thing there you go PC
troubleshooting no post-diagnosis go
ahead go through all those steps and see
if you can't figure it out
build a hackintosh yeah I do want to
build a hackintosh actually I even have
my copy of OS 10 and whatever kind of
cat we're on now on this drive I'm gonna
deal with it but I haven't done it yet
yeah the problem with the three free
games on the 7900 series Alex that's a
very good point that's something we
should bring up I forget it's I never
settled never settled promo you get
hitman absolution you get far cry 3 you
get I don't know one other game we
should look it up because it's a pretty
cool from that promo never settle AMD
3d on 7000 GOG Far Cry 3 hitman
absolution
and you get 20% off the new medal of
honor game so that is a pretty sweet
deal if you buy a 7800 series or a 7700
series you get far cry 3 so that is uh
that is pre sweet that actually reminds
me I was thinking that I would give away
a key for those three games on my
livestream so I would like you guys to
stay tuned
well I log into my email and let me just
sort of
that done ad account lioness huh oops
I might attack my password wrong nope I
got the password here we go here we go
here we go whoever claims it first is
gonna get it like that's all I have to
say whoever claims it first it's gonna
get I don't even know how to claim it I
don't even know if this is a steam code
so yeah you guys are gonna have to sort
of figure out how to do this and I am
going to yeah someone just someone just
emailed me they want the key good for
you I just deleted that email uh-huh
you're gonna have to you're gonna have
to fight over it on the live stream just
like everyone else so I have decided
that I will post it on Facebook I am
writing something right now on Facebook
I am going to paste the key actually you
know what I'm not gonna do this on the
stream because you guys you guys have to
go on Facebook - tech Facebook aha see
I'm totally being like a social media
whore and getting you guys to like play
my little game in order to get my little
giveaway I have pasted it now are you
ready I am posting it people who don't
have Facebook I'm sorry about that
maybe next time you'll be cooler than
that Facebook no I don't think there's
anything particularly cool about
Facebook I resisted getting Facebook
until now as you guys can clearly see
but the reality of it is it has
practical applications for people like
me who are trying to reach people and
for people who are wondering what I'm
doing to my cat I'm playing with him he
likes it I'm playing with his feet which
makes him happy and I'm petting his face
which he likes so you guys can't really
I realize that it looks sort of like
censored over here so okay I think you
guys get the point that I'm on Twitter
see I'm just playing with his face and
giving him stumbles which he likes he's
sitting on my lap
look at this this the most ridiculous
fat you ever saw just like sitting on
his back like that what kind of cat is
that now he's getting all vicious all
right let's do some more Q&amp;amp;A anyway yeah
it's a pretty cool promo so I hope I
hope someone got that that awesome that
awesome
code and I hope you guys are gonna like
me on Facebook because I'm gonna do more
giveaways on Twitter on facebook on
Twitter ventually and so yeah enjoy
enjoy what him now sorry Mike I don't
really have a $50 headphone
recommendation
what's better X Phi or on board I'm
getting a new headset need to know
what's best you know what I don't know
what the SBO 7 9 0 X Phi is although
it's been a long time since I've
recommended a creative much of anything
get an AC Susan our show no to Finland
oh my goodness it's 6:14 a.m. in Finland
I am sorry to hear that master Yoda
Terry asks what is the worst injury I've
ever received playing badminton that's a
great question the worst thing that ever
happened playing badminton I landed
funny when I was going back for a clear
and I kind of landed on my foot sort of
sort of bizarrely
and something in here one of the one of
the ligaments are one of the tendons are
something kind of deeper inside my foot
you got to send me disconnected or to me
horrible anyway I was probably limping
for two months three months couldn't
really play and then it was about six
months before the pain actually went
away but it's a hundred percent now
because I've hardly had any time to play
ah
Nikhil asks should I go with the 7h or
the 1500 get the 7h as long as you have
a decent sound card hello from Princeton
you had a blue quick-connect in an
earlier video who made it blue
quick-connect sorry I'm not sure what
you're talking about
sorry Joseph could I run a 787 from a
450 watt PSU as long as it's a good one
yes you know what that segways us very
nicely into my next topic which is how
to pick the perfect power supply for
your system it seems like ever
one these days wants to over build and
over spec their power supply thinking
that in again that's that future-proof
mentality thinking that at future proofs
them thinking that it might benefit them
in some way whereas in reality power
supplies do not benefit the user at all
if they are over the door the window of
my car that's that one time when extra
power supply on my car so this isn't a X
1200 I this is an 80 plus Platinum power
supply which is as close to 90 plus as
we are these days very very efficient
fully modular capable of delivering I
think it's something like the entire yes
the entire 1200 watts on the 12 volt
rail and just like redonkulous in every
possible way
what system requires something like this
not much you can easily power a 3770k
with you know 16 gigs of ram and SSD
drive and then a storage drive and you
know a gtx 680 like very I'm talking a
very high-end system with something more
along these lines which is a 550 watt 80
plus gold power supply I'm not I'm not
kidding Corsair again see sonic here or
anything like that it's nothing like
that I'm just saying in terms of the the
overall spec like what's necessary and
what's not parts are getting more power
efficient not less power efficient there
was a time when I bought a 430 watt and
tech true power thinking that Thomas
biggest power supply could possibly ever
need I was wrong
at that time CPUs GPUs particular
at the time I was buying a graphics card
that was high-end that had a fan this
big on it and a heatsink like this big
on it whereas now we have graphics cards
that are triple slot monstrosities with
duel fans and they suck back like a
hundred watts of power or more under
load so at that time buying a higher
wattage a higher capacity power supply
made a lot of sense where as we hit sort
of this plateau around the time Intel
stopped going with the whole netburst
thing where power for cpus has actually
been reducing with every generation
until they ramped up the core count and
then it goes up a little bit but it's
generally the trend is down
finally on GPUs the trend is level or
down when you look at the 6/8 6600
series and the 7000 series so why are we
over buying on power supply this is
something that's really important to
understand guys this is like super super
important this right here him ok I hope
you guys can see this I kind of doubt it
but this right here is the efficiency
curve of this power supply this is that
100% load where you can see the
efficiency is actually falling below 90%
to 100% load at 10% load the efficiency
this power supply is right down around a
7% ok so if we actually wanted to get
the best efficiency possible out of this
PSU we would want to be at around 50%
load okay so think about that for a
second this is a 1200 watt power supply
under load under load like extreme load
that 3770k machine with the 680 probably
sucks maybe 450 Watts from the wall
maybe 500 Watts from the wall which
means that you're only actually using
around 400 to 450 Watts out of the power
supply which will put you around that
30% range where the efficiency actually
starts to drop off okay now consider the
following this power supply will be
running at idle modern gaming machines
idle around a hundred watts will be
running at less than 10% load
could you read you can see how this
curve is dropping off here so that'll
put you probably somewhere in the
neighborhood of 85% efficiency when
you're not actually doing anything
intensive when you're browsing the web
or watching videos or whatever else
you're doing so problem by a power
supply that's well suited for your
machine
if you are planning triple GPUs if you
are planning dual CPU if you're gonna go
crazy or you want some specific feature
of a very high-end power supply I'm
using a thousand watt power supply but
I'm using it for a very specific reason
because it has a feature that's similar
to this one where the fan actually
doesn't turn on until 50 percent load
that's why I'm using it because I'm
going for silence if you want a feature
like that go ahead buy a high-end
product but just know what you're
getting yourself into if you don't want
that buy a good quality but lower
wattage power supply this 550 watt power
supply let's see if I can find the
efficiency curve on it really they don't
put really they don't put the efficiency
curve on the outside of the package
who does that well who doesn't do that
okay well they're killing me here but if
I have an efficiency curve to show you
from my from a lower wattage power
supply I would be able to show you that
it will be at around 20 percent load at
idle which will be significantly more
efficient then that 1200 watt power
supply running on the same system and
then when it's actually under load it
will be more efficient than this power
supply would have been during eyeblink
so it'll still be at you know around 80%
load which is going to be that point
where the curve starts to starts to
decline so there that is my lecture on
the importance of picking an appropriate
power supply if you're not really sure
how much power
something consumes it's as simple as
checking reviews for the product because
you know someone like an anon tech
usually measures power consumption of
the entire system and then you can sort
of extrapolate things here and there and
figure out approximately how much you
need and then people will people will
tell me sue they've like Noah Linus I
need a thousand watt power supply
because I'm gonna add like 10 fans and
I'm gonna add four hard drives I'm like
yeah okay
hard drives are adding maybe 5 to 10
watts per
which means if you add for hard drives
we're talking 40 Watts here fans oh man
we're talking like maybe like 2 watts 3
watts per fan so if you're loading it up
with fans you're loading up with hard
drives maybe by a 650 watt like don't
don't turn the door don't overthink it
too much here so I hope you guys found
that educational and interesting and if
you didn't then I guess you can go tune
into someone else's livestream but
people are still watching so it seems
like people are still still enjoying
some people are asking for the cat to
come back Rumble oh here here comes
rubble come here come here sweetheart
come here good boy good boy that's right
come on come on good boy
see cat totally comes when I call him
sometimes when he feels like it so yep
Oh rocky came to rock it doesn't always
come when I call him hey sweetheart come
here
oh oh okay well I'm sorry rocket didn't
manage to visit us but it looks like
rumbles come back too to settle and
snuggle with us for a little bit here so
let's go back to Twitter and let's take
some more questions if you guys don't
know already I'm Matt Linus tech on
Twitter I'm really really hard to find
I'm told I'm totally gonna add that
thing again we're totally gonna add that
thing again wait for it wait for it
Twitter yes on Twitter it doesn't let me
move it look at it doesn't let me move
it any lower than this which is where I
actually want to put it and it doesn't
let me move it any higher than this so I
can either cut off my face or I should
cut I can cut off Rumble space so what
would you guys prefer I'm gonna go to
the twitch chat for this guys would you
prefer I cut off my own face or cut off
Rumble space
I'm waiting for it there's a suggestion
and twitch that I should grow a stache
for Movember but I can't because I don't
have I don't have I don't have facial
hair and it's a very sad thing okay
people want me to cut off my face so I'm
cutting off my face you can sit on my
head like that and then it's tech on
Twitter all right Twitter questions
let's scroll up where we have 1 billion
new interactions tech this Buffalo okay
you are officially shouted out are you
still using a UPS or any sort
yes I actually just acquired a new UPS
so I'm super stoked on that and UPS is
are amazing and everyone should use a
UPS because it protects your components
from dirty power which even in you know
first world developed countries is very
much present and keeps your stuff from
like dying and also if you're like
flashing firmwares or whatever else your
power can't go out in the middle of it
because the UPS will keep the power on
what's the best PC headset to use with
soundcard 7h I would argue although
there's something really cool coming
someone someone messaged me about this I
think on Facebook let me just check let
me check my messages this looks really
cool this is the wrong this is the wrong
thing this is my personal Facebook okay
so maybe now I can see really okay how's
this work
I don't really understand Facebook like
yeah I don't I don't really I don't
really get it
so yeah whatever
it's like it's like a mic that clips
onto the side of your headphones mic
headphone clip no yes mod mic so if you
get a mod mic then you can get like a
sweet pair of headphones like something
like an HD 555 which I used to use
before I wanted a headset so I had a mic
permanently attached I used to actually
just wear another headset around my neck
and then have the mic coming up here so
the mod mic allows you to just basically
put this little attachment piece and
then it's an easily removable thing that
you can put on the side of Awesome
headphones and turn it into a headset
and then it just goes up like this it's
not done yet
but I've asked them to send one so that
I can check it out and let you guys know
if it's any good but I'm super super
excited about that because I don't give
a ton more options for what PC gamers
can use for their headset when actually
they can use awesome headphones and then
just throw a nice high-quality mic on it
cuz I think desktop mics are kind of
lame although slick swears by them so
you know whatever I'm not judging if you
use a desktop mic when are you doing the
silver so I have two three mini build
I'm sorry you guys I'll do it I'll do it
I'll do it at some point
I'm sorry I was wondering if you can
tell me some cases that are able to
house a Corsair h 100 and push-pull you
know that best thing to do is just
google it um you know if you just kind
of go i don't know 800 d h 100 push paul
if you guys can see the autocomplete and
even auto-completed that for me so you
can see people who have it set up I'm
sorry excuse me that's the best thing to
do figure out the cases you like and
just check see if someone else has
already done it because even the
manufacturers sometimes think that you
can do it in any canton so yeah
Jordan asks what do I think about the
fifteen hundred US dollar murder box MK
- is it overkill Jordan I think you know
the answer to that however one thing
that I can justify about spending more
on certain components I've always
believed in spending more on once you
have already have a high performance
computer like once you don't get any
more benefit from spending more on the
parts is I do believe in spending money
on a case especially I feel if you have
to look at it all the time I do believe
in spending money on peripherals and
displays and speakers and the reason for
the case I mean I've probably spent a
total of around a thousand dollars on my
case at this point between painting and
treatments that I've done with it and
sort of modding and the fact that I
bought a dremel just so I could punch
holes in my case so yeah is it
outlandish well yeah but do it can I
kind of understand it I guess if you're
gonna keep it forever then maybe but yes
I think it's overkill watching your
livestream from the iPad Mini wow that's
so amazing thank you for watching the
live stream from the iPad Mini I hope
you're enjoying your iPad Mini I
actually have another chance to check it
out yet what do I think of the new NZXT
280 millimeter radiator it seems like a
little reward for case compatibility if
little reward
Sun Sun you don't know what you're
talking about
okay 140 millimeter only sounds a little
bit bigger than 120 millimeter but in
terms of the actual surface area
available for cooling it is night and
day and for these prefilled liquid
cooling kits these days we are very much
limited by the surface area of the
is available for cooling we are not
limited by the efficiency of the blocks
we're not limited by liquid flow we are
limited by how much how much thin we can
push air through I am super excited
about this 280 millimeter radiator
because it will probably scale pretty
much linearly in terms of adding more
surface area getting better performance
at a lower fan noise than something like
an H 100 nope I am super stoked for that
product flip Polizzi hey Linus's flip I
know can you recommend a custom nice box
custom nose with WD red drives great
question ultimate pretty much this this
is my ultimate Windows Home Server guide
you're gonna want to get sort of a good
value raid card you're gonna actually
with Windows 8 you don't really need one
anymore which is pretty cool you're
gonna want to get something like a
fractal design node 3 or 4 which is the
replacement for the array r2 which is
the one I show in the video you don't
want to get a little ITX board and you
can build yourself a pretty neat little
machine in a very small form-factor
these days with lots and lots of hard
drives so yes daniel asks why are my
cats bengals
well because bengals are beautiful and
because they were born Bengals and I
liked them so I got them I I just I like
the markings I think the breed is very
beautiful the the general person I mean
I did a ton of research before deciding
to go with bred cats for one thing
because it was always something I kind
of objected to before it was time for me
to get my own cats you know one for the
price I think you know they asked for a
lot of money but then I also understand
it's a lot of work raising cats so one
for that and then two for the fact that
there's enough strays that you know why
are we buying cats and then the flipside
of that from my side is that with the
breeds you don't only get the looks but
you also get certain and personality
traits so I wanted cats that were super
high-energy I wanted cats that were
super exciting to play with and their I
wanted them to be fast and athletic and
just sort of you know really yeah
high-energy
angles are also extremely devoted to
their owners they're very they get very
attached they they're their ex they're
just very they're very they're such
lovers like he'll sleep on my chest in
the middle of the night like I'll be
laying on my back in bed and he'll just
come in he'll walk up and he'll just
curl up on my chest which is just the
cutest thing ever and so the way that I
justified it to myself as that kind of
went well okay it's $1,000 per cat which
is a lot of money but at the end of the
day I'm stuck with this thing this is
this is a commitment that I'm making for
you know 20 years or more you know I
want to make sure that I get the kind of
cat that I want I want to make sure that
I have a chance to to check out the
kateri which is sort of a cat breeder I
want to meet sort of his mom and dad and
find out what kind of temperament they
have when when they're older I want to I
mean none of these are guarantees but
it's all things that sort of make me
feel a little bit better if I'm making a
commitment like that I mean the thing
about adopting I would adopt a dog but I
don't think I'd adopt a cat because cats
tend to be very emotionally scarred when
something sort of terrible happens to
them and you can adopt kittens too I
know that too but again it's just sort
of where were my comfort level was add
did I think it was a lot of money yes
but if you amortize it over 20 years of
the kind of companionship you get from
someone like this character then yeah it
doesn't seem that bad anymore so that's
why my cats are Bengals I did a lot of
research on the different breeds sort of
what I what I thought I wanted I mean
they're very striking which is an
obvious reason why why people like
Bengals they have just these beautiful
beautiful spots and coats and they look
just sort of amazing and it's one of
those things where you know if you have
sort of any desire for people to come
over to your house and see your cats and
be like holy crap you have such cool
cats then you know I enjoy that it's
kind of it's gonna neat you know
everyone likes my cats even cat haters
seem to sort of like my cats so Brent I
own a prebuilt PC that contains a 920
but I want to build my own PC around
Black Friday is it worth keeping ah you
know what you're probably getting to the
point where you're gonna see some
significant benefit from upgrading from
a 920 on the other hand 920 is still a
pretty decent chip
it's equivalent to Linfield a little bit
slower than Sandy Bridge and then which
is a little bit slower than Ivy Bridge
so especially if you overclock it's
still a very capable chip you might want
to look at maybe a graphics card upgrade
rather than a CPU upgrade if you want to
get the best bang for your buck Alex
asks how I like the surface I still love
the surface I still think it's the bee's
knees however I could also be sold on a
form factor like this which leads me
well into my next topic which is the
Acer s7 this is like the sexiest little
Ultrabook that doesn't seem to actually
be an ultrabook branded thing if you
want to know exactly what an ultrabook
is you can check out my video on it it's
on the NCIX channel what is an ultrabook
so it has like a sweet sort of brushed
finish that I had a couple people in the
office so to tell me they hated but I
liked it for a very specific reason well
I hate the iPad 2 backing and the reason
is because it's perfect I'm going
somewhere with this don't worry
it's perfect which means the first time
you take it and put it down on the
surface and someone walks along and
pushes something on the counter and it
scratches along there and you get a
scratch on it you may be like oh no it's
not perfect now I need an iPad 3 which I
guess is part of a strategy maybe
whereas this has this kind of pattern of
scratches on it that gives it a bit of a
a bit of a sort of neat look but it'll
also hide it if you get little scratches
on it it won't be as noticeable and it
won't look as ugly if you happen to
scratch it in the future so I like that
it is extremely thin and I'm totally
gonna do it I'm gonna do the iPhone
thickness comparison but check that out
this notebook is so freakin fit I'm
gonna move this a little bit closer to
you guys so you can truly enjoy the
thinness of this notebook very very thin
see there I finally got a position right
extremely thin extremely light like it's
light enough you can almost kind of card
it around like a tablet it's very small
so here's the sort of lioness arm size
comparison very small it has real i/o
and it has a real OS unlike something
like a tablet so you've got USB 3 on
this side you've got your micro
Steve God headphone jack and this side
nothing on this side nothing there's
your power which again is more like a
tablet positioning for the power button
more USB 3 power in and then ventilation
at the back as well as that looks like a
micro HDMI oh so you've got all these
real PC i/o options you've got the
flexibility of using it a number of
different ways it wakes from sleep
extremely quickly like almost all
Windows 8 machines you have a full-size
keyboard again the build quality isn't
what I'd consider to be perfect I don't
know if you guys can hear that but like
when you when you mash on the touchpad
like it's oh oh it's no it's a clicky
touchpad that's why it does it like not
a design choice that I probably have
made as the product manager but you know
no one's perfect hinge feels okay hinge
feels good this is a metal this is a
metal backing this is a metal surface
here as well
the bottom is plastic so this part of
the screen is glass right up to the edge
so it just feels really really solid on
the parts where you're actually touching
it and then on the bottom if you don't
you don't touch that part so I guess
it's not as much of a concern it's got
real speakers unlike most tablets
professionally tuned Dolby home theater
I don't know like home theater speakers
but I think I press the power button
when I had it open last time um so this
this will give you some idea of how good
something also gives you that that
ability to use it as a touchscreen as a
touchscreen notebook as as kind of kind
of a tablet because like I said in my
last livestream where I talked a lot
about Windows 8 and a lot about touch
the problem with touch is that when the
computer is this far away from me like a
desktop this is not comfortable whereas
with a super small super slim notebook
like this it's sitting on my lap it is
just as convenient for me I'm gonna try
and sort of I'm gonna try and position
myself in such a way that this makes
sense for you guys but it's gonna be
positioned on me like this for me to
comfortably use it and if I'm using
Internet Explorer what is actually
faster from a notebook usage perspective
think about this if you're using Windows
7 to come down to the touchpad here
figure out where the mouse cursor is and
go to the button remember you're using a
touchpad not a mouse touch pads are slow
or from the home row because everything
happens from the home row to go like
this
what's actually
faster touchscreen makes so much sense
to me from a notebook perspective with a
tiny device like this where it becomes a
very lifestyle like device that you can
really take with you anywhere because
it's not much thicker than an iPhone
I think it's an 11 point something inch
screen for those of you are just tuning
in this is the Acer Aspire s7 and I
think I'm signed in too though I think
I'm logged in to my right yeah there we
go oh this is a great friend on the NZXT
forum unboxing this teach us nothing
someone complained about my unboxing
videos and there's a big long thread
about it
something something anyway so okay here
how about this then so I'm browsing the
site and I want to type something I want
to type a reply again
what's faster from the home row from how
I'm using the computer hitting reply
okay maybe that's not faster cuz it's a
tiny button and then going like this or
is it actually faster to use my touchpad
like this I would argue touchscreen
makes a lot of sense I would argue this
is a very freaking cool little device
and if you guys want to check something
like this out it'll actually be at the
windows 8 launch party at the Aberdeen
mall in Richmond tomorrow so if you guys
don't know about this if you are located
in the Lower Mainland which is where I
live then I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna
go to the NCIX site where there's
hopefully a thread in the forum about
this Windows 8 launch party and we are
going to I will I'm going to be there
tomorrow windows 8 launch party Aberdeen
Center atrium ground level Richmond BC
there's prizes to be won there's gonna
be exclusive show deals and all kinds of
cool stuff you can check out the event
page on Facebook I will be there from
around 11:30 or 12:00 to around 3
o'clock so now you can feel free to come
by and say hi and we're gonna have all
kinds of cool devices like this and I
might bring my surface so I might not
I'm not sure cuz since Jack's doesn't
really carrying them anyway but yeah
yeah I hope to I hope to see you guys
there so that Segway done you know what
I'm actually gonna here I'll take my in
my hole this is my whole topic list for
tonight so I've talked about this I
talked about this I have talked about
this I have talked about this
oh I haven't talked about the parentage
movie so honestly guys I should preface
this by saying I was never really into
pure ownage like really never really
into pure ownage but it's all a
indiegogo.com sure old-aged spelt with a
P which makes it obviously very easy to
Google check this out
so these guys said they needed $75,000
to make a pure ownage movie if you guys
know you know FPS dog hey you know the
super enthusiastic guy so I just thought
you guys should see this I again I
watched some of their old stuff I was
never really into it at the time I
watched some of the old stuff it didn't
make much sense to me but I figured you
guys might care because people seem to
be pretty excited about this whole this
whole thing so the the campaign starts
with him sniffing the bandana that he
wore as his character and then the
officer discussing whether they should
make a pyrimidine the whole raised about
of their goal really quick I want to
find out if the sound is moving someone
says mute it we can't hear you
I don't know whatever sound is so loud
the sound were to put to something
something sounds loud it's loud okay
sound is loud okay so what I should
probably do is turn the sound up on the
camera and then or maybe down on my
computer or whatever else okay so
there's that and then the other one that
I'm actually genuinely really excited
about is shoot what's it called
youtube.com/ star citizen that's right
sorry start student okay if you guys
haven't seen this on Twitter already I
posted this on Twitter if you haven't
seen this on Facebook already go to my
facebook it's the post sort of it's not
that far down the page I think I posted
yesterday the day before star citizen
yeah okay I posted about it a while ago
I think no this is the beginning I don't
know it's on here somewhere
oh my goodness if you guys ever played
Wing Commander if you ever played TIE
fighter if you've ever played freelancer
if you've ever played any space sim
games or anything like that you guys are
gonna be just so freakin stoked on this
PC okay held on own you have to you have
to see this part because it's all it's
all about it's all about this I am a PC
game this is not some console thing like
this thing halo pc game space sim
dogfights and space stuff like this is
real in game footage they're pointing at
it
this is in-game footage guys this is
rendered in the engine they're using try
engine it is going to be amazing and
there is a there is there's a
Kickstarter thing
chris roberts
the gaming scene for a while here but he
is back and the more money he raises the
better and game he's gonna build he's
actually a lot of charm
star citizen here we go here we go
if you google it you can see the the
money that's been raised the money
that's that they need and then they've
got this whole chart of how much money
they need to raise in order to make the
game whatever he's done a lot of work on
it already there's a couple trailers
available absolutely and the other issue
I think that's one of the game character
himself is let's do a little bit thank
you for watching why as you know it
really stand up second ethical arts and
I have s our town because it's too pixel
best all
I'm really excited strong Connie
demonstrates interacts with how you very
much like a next 35 fly-by-wire so they
take your input as a pilot sound card
five function to the rescue Gentry's in
the best of that uses to achieve if I
want to pitch actually polls the trustee
looks great no thrusters to go back to
the flight computer and says okay in
between the one of a millisecond I give
you this much thrust the whole system is
dynamic keep doing that every single
frame yet it's fine that way it's really
cool because what happens is a lot of
unexpected or dynamic behavior happens
by a table what's your system rating
we're flying around up by one of our
thrusters gets damaged it will affect on
Nouveau buildings and it's not a matter
of changing descriptive data it's
actually all Dino provisional games
it is a really great example of scale
I'm going to walk I'm here finally it's
5 a.m.
thank you for tuning in to the second
it's huge
or Harry no see that's in the prototype
level is about a kill medium power
consumption not important unless
activity spacious people so one of the
things that I'm the most excited by we
have a detail full scale at a human
level so anything from AC RMS is inside
then the same level of detail for all
you move air could be theoretically
moved by that I'm building a game you're
gonna universe essentially the universe
in the game I would like Twitter so it's
for gamers social experience how much
I'm thinking PC ever console because PC
was what I always used to do in the past
but more importantly he sees an open
platform because she's always innovating
I really care about the passion I really
want to push that it's a situation could
he see game you see game it's the medium
that is the coolest CMS powerful and
that's really why I'm gonna try and
engage sold in the ship dealers on seven
planets and you know maybe the person
that built that spaceship so one of the
resistance funding is cutting out it's
an exhausting directly with the people
more resistance perience the less
important is so one of my main goals
when I write anything just you're really
radiators you don't even I think have
seen that honestly I've never even try a
new website or a special protocol to
direct in the air through there I want
to take it's not going to learning
something like a gangsta can do that si
these fans with the rotor absolutely
Bella T or films real-time or on a rig I
mean open air my agent is chris Roberts
using the right fan I actually did a
video about this Corsair fan NCIX or
something I did the video about it yeah
there we go this one right here where I
explained all of the different has the
importance of static pressure and ncf
fans and i show some graphs and I show a
big yard show you guys this I show a big
fancy machine that's used to measure
static pressure and n3f and I test a
bunch of fans on it here I'm explaining
about how the static pressure means
there's resistance which is sort of
exactly the example I just gave now so
there you go and yeah that video is
definitely worth checking out if you
want to learn a little bit more about
picking the right fans for your case
unboxing videos give you more info about
the products itself yes they do if
they're if they're decent can you
recommend a USB sound card for 5.1
surround not really for about that you
live in Canada when is the next time
you're in Silicon Valley probably no
time soon to be honest how many streams
do can I do not the same stream split by
the way you'll need gigabit ethernet as
long as you have a powerful storage
subsystem on the other side you might
want to check out my server and cix tech
tips I did a video where I did like a
quad gigabit like redonkulous hold on
where is it yeah ultimate home Nath set
up with a for gigabit network connection
episode I think I was running seven or
eight drives
seven or eight drives in raid 0 or
something stupid like that and then what
I do is I run 1080p streams to like five
computers at the same time or something
like that long as you have the storage
horsepower on the other side for it it
can be done no problem
planning out my loop and I see 70 I want
dual to where 40 is it inefficient at
one intake no not at all last time you
GPU a net external GP do you have any
experience by any chance unfortunately
not yet I will check it out as soon as I
do get a chance though is it worth
paying 10% more for a 3 for a 3 gigabyte
gigahertz paper X additional ranking
rate 7970 performance difference won't
be that much especially once you're
overclocking them touchscreen notebooks
are awesome yes I agree and thank you
for watching my unboxings however it
wouldn't my feelings wouldn't be heard
if you watched someone else's let me
just see if I have any more ah yes I
wanted to talk about storage spaces a
little bit more so storage spaces some
of the challenges that I've had with it
so if you guys aren't familiar with
storage spaces already it's a Windows 8
feature that's gonna allow you to just
kind of it's kind of like the drive pool
and Windows Home Server where you just
kind of chuck in drives willy-nilly they
can be any capacity that can be any
brand you don't need a raid card as long
as you have a SATA connection plugging
into it you can add it to it actually
even if you don't have a SATA connection
if you have a USB 3 connection or a
thunderbolt connection
I used thunderbolt to add drives to a
storage space today just to see if it
worked because I was curious so you can
add things willy-nilly and you can get
data redundancy which means that it
doesn't protect you from something like
a virus that attacked all your files or
from something like someone formatting
your entire computer or whatever but it
does protect you from physical drive
failures as long as you don't have sort
of too many at the same time so you can
run it in a number of different modes
you can run it in sort of a raid 1 so so
single redundancy so as long as you have
at least two drives of the same capacity
it will fill both of them equally with
the same data and there's really no
performance benefit or problem you can
have dual redundancy which means you
need at least three drives no at least 5
drives few drives think at least 5
something I forget what them but the
limit is but that way makes sure that
any data you write is backed up on at
least three drives at any given
which is kind of neat it's like a super
raid one and then the other one is
parody which is a raid five like a fake
raid five that uses a CPU instead of a
dedicated raid card and the raid five
parody is the one that I was really
excited about because it uses it
calculates a parity bit which means that
if you have at least three drives you'll
get two drives worth of capacity and
then one for parity and then if you have
five drives you get four drives worth of
capacity and then one for parity and no
matter almost how much you scale it so
that's cool but and then what I thought
was that we were gonna get really great
performance out of it even in rights
because it was gonna take advantage of
your CPU which is so fast these days
that you could you know hammer it with
rate parity calculations and it wouldn't
even care but unfortunately it looks
like with my four drive WD read set up
and this is pretty common I am limited
to about 30 megabytes per second writes
reads are still fine but rights are slow
now rights are the challenging part of a
raid 5 because it has to actually
calculate that parody that data
redundancy part while it is writing the
data it has to do it in real time but I
was really expecting a lot better than
that another one of the challenges that
I ran into is that rearranging things
about the drive pool the storage space
is not that easy you can't actually
reduce the capacity of a storage space
once you've committed it and it looks
like there's some rules in terms of
removing drives from the storage space
without just pulling them out and
rebuilding it which is which is
challenging to me I don't really I don't
really like that because rebuilding an
array can be one of the most stressful
things you do to an array which if you
have one drive that failed and there's
another one on the brink that can be the
thing that pushes out other Drive over
the edge and you will lose all your data
so I would have liked if there was a
graceful way to manually remove a drive
without just kind of pulling it out I
did sort of didn't really like that
about it either
I'm still pretty excited about the
feature because it still gives people
access to to raid 5 in a way that's
easier and less fussy than running it
even off your motherboard and certainly
off of an ad in raid card but I'm just a
little bit less
excited about it than I was before so
let's do a little bit more Q&amp;amp;A on
Twitter looks like people are tuning out
so patently they're bored of my my
storage spaces talk oh no last thing
last thing last topic that you guys may
or may not care about and I have a new
tech tips to do so you can check this
out
oh my goodness I have a green screen now
so I can do all kinds of cool stuff on
my green screen and then I will be using
my other walls so you can see here's the
green wall here's the blue walls as
potentially a blue screen over here if
I'm wearing green and I don't want to do
fancy masking and whatnot and in After
Effects or in whatever video suite and
then this will also be the background
for NCI expect it so we moved NCI expect
hips this room I no longer have any
access to this room is dead and we are
going back to the old look I just
decided because there were some problems
with the new tech tips room reflections
off the glossy paint and things weren't
perfect um I'd like to get a new TV as
well that has actually here I can move
this down the cat's been here I'd like
to get a new TV as well that doesn't
have a reflective bezel around it
because that's just obnoxious but there
was something to be said for the
classics older-style tech tips room with
just the blue background so we're gonna
go back to that and I am super super
excited about the new tech tips room and
some of the neat stuff I can do with
chroma keys and maybe I can put
something else behind me or something
cool like that so we're going back to
more like this style and should be good
should be good and very excited so so
there now we are going back to Q&amp;amp;A so
Q&amp;amp;A will be on Twitter please respond I
accidentally formatted my hard drive and
I want to recover the follow us is it
possible yes there are software
applications that you can use as long as
you didn't do like a full overwriting
format it's been a long time since I've
looked into it most of them are pay
applications but a lot of them have
previews that you can use and what
they'll do is they'll bring up a
directory list and tell you this is all
the stuff we can recover if you give us
50 bucks or whatever else it is so yes
it can be possible I have a twenty two
hundred dollar budget for a gaming
editing bill and I'm looking at
you KN GTX 680 I would probably
recommend a 660 TIR 670 there are much
better value right now or a 79 50 or 70
970 the 680 is probably on the high end
the worst value GPU out there right now
just because 7970 is faster with the
latest drivers from AMD and even 660ti
is really not that much slower I just
built my first PC and I want to
overclock what's a good low temp to stay
at on AMD probably around 80 degrees is
from your max and actually
unintelligible
when you're doing an artificial stress
test how often should I replace my
storage hard drive what you should do is
you should do regular backups and then
you can replace it whenever it dies
because you'll have regular backups so
it doesn't really matter uh what sound
card would you recommend for a media PC
I would recommend optical or coaxial out
to a receiver that would probably be the
best thing because you're gonna need a
pretty decent amp in order to get the
kind of sound you want from from a from
a 5.1 surround system on a TV is Amna
good manufacturer sure um not my
favorite power supply brand by any
stretch I'd go probably an Tek Corsair
and Corsair I've never tried on raid
good question not something that I've
that I've done ah
Adrian I'm not really an engineer it's
probably not really the right question
for me um hard to say depends how much
you can get for those 550 TI's because a
660 t you know what it's probably yeah
it's probably a good value
I probably I'd probably consider that I
know I don't understand what that means
I'll probably have to look it up later
we lost ten minutes of live I forgot the
other video in the background we go okay
that's bad how can I get a TPM chip uh
you have to buy a motherboard with a TPM
chip on it so possible to use RAM as
video RAM if you have onboard video then
yes otherwise new can you use the USB as
RAM no it's way too slow okay you have
to meet the son yeah we couldn't oh
that's probably why people were tuning
out oh my bad I'm sorry guys yeah oops I
just smashed my keyboard when I saw your
halo 4 copy I'm going to the mid-late
launched
stoked really Alex so much tonight unbox
the shine box or whatever this is the
limited edition on camera you know what
I'm gonna let the twitchchat decide
because I never let two I never let them
say anything what should we do what
should we do
yes yes yes yes yes
whoa it's going way too fast for me to
do anything okay it looks like the bulk
of them are saying yes so we are going
to do this we're gonna do this thing
we're gonna unbox a halo 4 limited
edition live and that will cover the
last sort of three minutes of the
livestream here so if you don't care
about this I guess you can - no and I'm
having a lot of trouble here so this
might be worth watching
ah okay the plastic is off and actually
I get a lot of questions about whether
what happens to the products i unbox in
this case one of my co-workers will
actually be buying this this this copy
that I have already unboxed so he's he's
putting off buying his copy of halo 4
until until it unbox until he gets the
unboxing so it's kind of tricky how this
actually opens here it seems - ah yes it
slides out here so there's the limited
edition casing we can check out the
system specs which is have an Xbox ok
shipwrecked on a mysterious world faced
with new enemies and deadly technology
the Master Chief returns to battle an
ancient evil bent on vengeance and
annihilation enlist as a Spartan for
aboard the UNSC infinity and blah blah
blah blah blah digital content something
something so you get three war game
backpacks 9x total 9 maps to an IMAX
total ha we're talking about console
games and Mac's on my stream can you
believe that
ok 9 Maps total Forward Unto Dawn
special edition live-action series
launch day access to 6 specializations
unique in-game skins and emblem avatar
cryotube prop and avatar Spartan armor
cool and then there's some cool stuff
inside here mount axe literally
we launched four gigs of storage
required okay ah coop two to four
players one before Linus never become a
voice actor thank you for that okay so
this we're putting a sign and now in the
world where this is copy two hundred and
thirty one thousand one hundred and
seventy seven I don't feel like it's not
limited at that point we've got some
like shiny text here we got a box that's
kind of folded in the corner in a very
epic looking way oh there's a magnet you
can tell that like something is epic in
limited edition when it's shiny and has
a magnet so let's take this out here we
go oh oh
wait for it wait for it okay the first
thing we find inside is I don't know
what this is infinity and it has like a
metal metal thing binding it here and it
has like a plastic hard covered it's
supposed to be like a clipboard or
something I guess small though okay so
this is kind of translucent very
high-tech okay property it's Spartan
Gabriel thorn that's my middle name
actually Gabriel in case you couldn't
tell the letter on the next page was
written by a UNSC committee that still
thinks of the Spartans as a navy project
and not their own branch well they wrote
it and my bosses in a fit of play nice
with the rest of them made me sign it
but what the committee my bosses didn't
do was ship the thing out leaving me the
opportunity to add my own something
something something I don't know one
piece of Spartan welcome aboard the UNSC
infinity and welcome to the next phase
of your stellar career something
infinity mass deployment there's like
specks of like some ship or something
there's it's our gun aha an assault
rifle if it's anything like the assault
rifle from halo 1 which is the last
table game I played then it probably
sucks and you should just use the pistol

detonators haha something care for your
armor all Spartan for class operatives
