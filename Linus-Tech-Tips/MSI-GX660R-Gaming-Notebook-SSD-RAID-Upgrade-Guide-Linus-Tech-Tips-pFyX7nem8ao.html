the GX 660 R I actually mentioned that
this my oven this motherboard well the
motherboard of this laptop supports dual
drives and it also has dual drives
within the chassis so it comes by
default with 640 gigs total that is 320
gigs x 2 and raid 0 but you are not by
any means obligated to keep that
configuration so what I'm going to be
showing you guys today is I'm going to
take apart the laptop and I'm going to
show you how I would upgrade it either
to a single boot SSD to go with one of
those hard drives being left behind for
storage or even if I wanted to upgrade
to dual SSDs in raid 0 to replace the
dual hard drives that come by default in
raid 0 so the first step is gonna be to
turn the laptop off which is fairly
straightforward
no would normally be fairly
straightforward shutdown there we go so
we're gonna do that before opening up
the casing and we're also going to
unplug the battery and unplug the power
cord just to make sure that while we're
taking around with the inside guts
we are not potentially going to be
upsetting anything you know shorting
anything live so take that off there
we're gonna flip this guy over here
camera chest tripod it's gonna slip just
awesome to unlock release get that out
there's my battery ok 7800 milliamp
hours in case anyone was wondering ok so
yeah that's the first step actually
maybe in retrospect a better first step
would be to use the msi burnrecovery
utility to create an OS restore disk
there's a good idea for you so I yes
thank you u.s. yeah I would like to burn
this disk so here we go can restore your
system back to default settings if you
want to create a recovery disk now
please follow the instructions to
proceed
okay click Next oh I guess I better put
that in the drive and I hopefully will
create a recovery disk so yeah we'll do
that first so removing the hard drives
from the GX 660 by the way it was a
three disc process and actually took me
quite a while to make the msi recovery
discs that I assume I'll need I mean I
have a Windows disk Andy and I could
just install like a blank Windows just
from scratch and then dig up all the
drivers on the MSI website and all that
but might be less hassle for me overall
to just use the recovery disk so one of
the screws from each of the drives is
actually removed when you take off the
back cover and then the other one has to
be removed afterwards both of these
drives should come out fairly easily
just gonna unplug that there okay so
drive number one looks like there's a
little uh little tab there
whatever let's just slide it see what
happens you get the cab that might help
there we go
so two scorpio black 320 gig is out now
let's find the other scorpio black 320
gig so I'm going to take out this little
rubber anti vibration stopper or
whatever it happens to be slide that
there and there we go the second
scorpion black 320 gig is out so let's
see if I only wanted to install a single
SSD drive and then leave one of these
hard drives in as a storage drive then I
would have only taken out about one of
the drives but I've decided what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna go with dual
SSDs and raid 2-0 to replace the dual
hard drives in raid 0 so here's all I
have to do is just take the mounting
hardware that was on the hard drive that
shipped in the system by default
and we are and throw that on there so
now I've got one SSD ready for mounting
okay so of course Air Force series SSD
so which one is which are these both the
same yeah it looks like both sets of
mounting hardware are identical so all I
have to do is swap that in there there
we are so that's on just fine and dandy
there I'm also gonna have to try and
remember which screw goes in now and
which one goes in when I replace the
cover so that we are opening this up
got another SSD here that we're gonna be
opening for this project there we are
and that up brand-spanking-new and let's
get this gonna fit on here maybe I'll
just stop for now you guys can come back
after I flip the other driving
alright so now I'm powering it on I've
got the press f3 to run recovery
I have recovery disk number one you can
see Oh control oh shoot control delete
so what I'm gonna have to do before I
before I get started with the recovery
or not is I'm going to have to configure
the rate because these drives were
configured in raid 0 so I'm going to
want to configure my new dry it's in
much the same manner so I'm pressing
ctrl I so I'm gonna go ahead and create
a raid volume I'm just gonna
okay let's call it four since that's the
kind of drives were using I'm gonna use
all the default values so raid zero is
for maximum performance although you
lose some of the well I mean you lose
what many would consider to be the
benefit of raid which is the well that
are redundant so there's nothing
redundant about a raid zero in fact if
either of the drives fails for whatever
reason you will lose all of your data
and CD boot could not find manager hmm
wonder if I mislabeled that disk this
one is the mystery disk
I actually burned four disks throughout
the course of trying to burn three and
that may have accidentally just sorted
these so let's see if let's just see if
that figures it out I'll be back in a
moment all right it's booting up now
three guesses what the problem was my
disks one and two were mislabeled as
each other if you don't feel like
guessing and this disk actually is
garbage which is I thought it was back
in a moment
so here I am in the recovery system
software so I'm just gonna click on hard
disk recovery which allows me to format
the whole hard drive the data will be
defragment and restored to factory
default settings
this one says only the OS tron would be
formatted okay let's go with that one
cool beans okay that actually took a
really long time it's um the next day
now to be perfectly honest I had it
running overnight
so I ran all three discs through not
says Windows 7 recovery successful press
ok and restart the system ok
so we'll find out shortly so here we are
it looks like we are back to a factory
fresh setting come on focus please focus
focus you can focus there you go
so this app will continue after
restarting your computer and yeah we've
got to Corsair 40 gig 4 series SSDs and
they're in place of the 320 gig WD
Scorpio blacks there's the raid config
and so yeah well see what happens when
we get to the desktop exciting actually
I guess maybe we'll just stay tuned and
have a look at what the boot time is
like on our first boot with the Corsair
force SSD raid 0 array one of the things
I've noticed a lot is that people on the
Internet's tend to okay well hold on
okay we're not going to see it now
because it's doing the performance
measuring thing but that people on the
Internet's tend to really exaggerate how
quickly their computers boot with SSDs
yeah it's faster but honestly boot time
is pretty inconsequential when it comes
to reasons to upgrade to an SSD so I'll
get this all set up in a moment here so
there we go it's back to its default
configuration comes with mostly useful
stuff installed things like when DVD
Dobby reader comes with Norton but it's
probably the only one thing that I had
to uninstall from this laptop so just
because I teased you guys with it before
I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys a
full reboot cycle with the SSD so you
can see the shutdown was quite fast
we're back to the BIOS already I'm
actually gonna have to pull these SSDs
out now that I've shown you guys how to
upgrade your laptop to a dual SSD raid 0
configuration I'll be putting these
drives back in for day to day use but
just thought it would be kind of a neat
video just to show what this laptop is
capable of so there we go we are back to
here once I enter the password we should
be able to open up programs pretty much
immediately well I haven't set up
Windows Media Player yet but you can
clearly see it opened up quickly so
there you go SSD makes a big difference
to performance thank you for checking
