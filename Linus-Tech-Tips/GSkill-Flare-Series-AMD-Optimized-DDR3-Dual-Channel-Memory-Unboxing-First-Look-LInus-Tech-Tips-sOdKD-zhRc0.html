the first AMD specific memory kit that i
have unboxed i was kind of interested in
it because this is a new heat spreader
design for g.skill so i wanted to have a
look as well as i wanted to talk a
little bit about what this means so it
says designed for AMD phenom 2 x6 cpu
that does not mean that that's the only
chip that it works with this compatible
motherboard list while handy and
convenient and includes some pretty darn
good boards like the 890 FX a GD 70 is
not comprehensive so this memory kit is
a ddr3 1806 cl9 latency and it is a four
gig kit so it'll be pretty much
compatible with any board out there but
what do you still saying is that it is
specifically validated for these cpus
and these motherboards so if you're
going to go with a combination of a
fenham 2x6 and any one of these boards
you buy this rim you know it's going to
run a hundred percent out of the box and
it's going to be effortless so that is
what they're trying to say so let's get
it open up and have a look at their
flare series heat spreader I believe
that's what it's called you don't quote
me yet yes Blair serious heat spreader
so first of all it comes with a gskill
ram fan and this isn't the one that I've
seen in the past this is a little bit
different it's not quite as robust as
the one that i unboxed in the past but
it's going to get the job done I can
tell that right off the bat you've got
240 millimeter fans they appear to be
LED fans although I don't know what
color they are right now I actually
didn't know there was going to be a ram
fan inside here so I apologize for not
having a power source handy but they've
got little little foamy two Clips here
so it's going to clip actually here I
can install it on it now I can't install
it on a motherboard sorry so it's got
little foamy clips here is going to sit
right over the RAM clips on the ends you
got one yeah only one power connector
that powers both fans it runs off a
4-pin molex and this hmm I wish I knew
what color leds they were let me see if
it says something on the back there yung
Lynn tech fans sorry about that okay
well moving on let's have a look at the
flare series memory modules so these are
a high performance module they're
running at higher than
what I would consider standard speeds
like 1333 megahertz 1600 megahertz so
while the Layton sees aren't
particularly impressive Wow the heat
spreader is and the speed is also a
little bit higher than what i would
consider normal so the flare series heat
spreader this looks terrific here is
your serial number sticker don't remove
that or you will void your warranty this
is also a good reminder if you ever try
to tune in your memory i did a guide on
that a little while back as well this is
where all of the settings that you need
to set in the bios are so let's have a
look so the flare series memory module
heat spreaders are kind of a i can tell
right now they're made of aluminum okay
they are abdul colored heat spreader
you're not getting like a brush finished
but you can tell especially the red has
a beautiful anodized finish it actually
has a little bit of a sparkle to it when
you catch it just right in the light I
don't know if the camera really can
catch all of that but it really looks
striking in the light the black is more
of a matte finish because when its
installed in your system you're going to
want to draw more attention to the red
then really the black so the black is
more like the background for the the
flare that's popping out of the middle
it has kind of a flame shape to each one
of the two each one of these I don't
know what to call them but each one of
these protrusions from the heat spreader
and the red ones in particular are more
of a it's really hard to get a good
angle on it but you can see the black
ones are more wide and short whereas the
red ones really do look more like a
flame spurt they're narrower and they're
a little bit longer there you can kind
of see from that angle so it's a
standard ddr3 module and then it'll fit
in just about any slot you want to watch
out for your height these are
approximately double height modules went
with the heat spreaders on them so if
you have a cpu cooler like this one here
you might actually run into a wee spot
of trouble if you're trying to install
one of these modules directly under the
cooler you can see that there's
definitely not enough clearance for that
whereas if you're putting it in the next
over slot and then the furthest one away
you would probably be fine so thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at the g.skill flare series modules
as well as their new Ram fan and thank
you for checking out my video blog don't
