the first AMD specific memory kit that I
have unboxed I was kind of interested in
it because this is a new heat spreader
design for g.skill so I wanted to have a
look as well as I wanted to talk a
little bit about what this means so it
says designed for AMD Phenom 2 x6 CPU
that does not mean that that's the only
chip that it works with this compatible
motherboard list while handy and
convenient and includes some pretty darn
good boards like the 90 FX a GD 70 is
not comprehensive so this memory kit is
a ddr3 1,800 megawatts kit it runs at
one point six five volts cl9 latency and
it is a four gig kit so it'll be pretty
much compatible with any board out there
but what do you feel saying is that it
is specifically validated for these CPUs
and these motherboards so if you're
gonna go with a combination of a phenom
2 x6
and any one of these boards you buy this
Ram you know it's gonna run a hundred
percent out of the box and it's going to
be effortless so that is what they're
trying to say so let's get it opened up
and have a look at their Blair series
heat spreader I believe that's what it's
called
you don't quote me yet yes Blair series
heat spreader so first of all it comes
with a g.skill Ram fan and this isn't
the one that I've seen in the past this
is a little bit different it's not quite
as robust as the one that I unboxed in
the past but it's gonna get the job done
I can tell that right off the bat you've
got 240 millimeter fans they appear to
be LED fans although I don't know what
color they are right now I actually
didn't know there was gonna be a ram fan
inside here so I apologize for not
having a power source handy but they've
got little little phony two Clips here
so it's gonna clip actually here I can
install it on it no I can't install it
on a motherboard sorry so it's got
little foamy clips here is gonna sit
right over the RAM clips on the ends you
got one yeah only one power connector
that powers both fans it runs off a
4-pin molex and this hmm I wish I knew
what color LEDs they were let me see if
it says something on the back there
young Linn Tech fans yeah sorry about
that okay well moving on let's have a
look at the flared series memory modules
so these are our high performance module
they're running at higher than
we have what I would consider standard
speeds like 13 33 megahertz 1600
megahertz so while the latencies aren't
particularly impressive wow the heat
spreader is and the speed is also a
little bit higher than what I would
consider normal so the flare series heat
spreader this looks terrific
here is your serial number sticker don't
remove that or you will void your
warranty this is also a good reminder if
you ever trying to tune in your memory I
did a guide on that a little while back
as well this is where all of the
settings that you need to set in the
BIOS are so let's have a look so the
flare series memory module heat
spreaders are kind of a I can tell right
now they're made of aluminum okay they
are a dual colored heat spreader you're
not getting like a brushed finish but
you can tell especially the red has a
beautiful anodized finish it actually
has a little bit of a sparkle to it when
you catch it just right in the light I
don't know if the camera really can
catch all of that but it really looks
striking in the light the black is more
of a matte finish because when it's
installed in your system you're gonna
want to draw more attention to the red
then really the black so the black is
more like the background for the the
flare that's popping out of the middle
it has kind of a flame shape to each one
of the two each one of these I don't
know what to call them but each one of
these protrusions from the heat spreader
and the red ones in particular are more
of a it's really hard to get a good
angle on it but you can see the black
ones are more wide and short whereas the
red ones really do look more like a
flame spurt they're narrower and they're
a little bit longer there you can kind
of see from that angle so it's a
standard ddr3 module and then it'll fit
in just about any slot you want to watch
out for your height these are
approximately double height modules when
with the heat spreaders on them so if
you have a CPU cooler like this one here
all right you might actually run into a
wee spot of trouble if you're trying to
install one of these modules directly
under the cooling you can see that
there's definitely not enough clearance
for that whereas if you're putting it in
the next over slot and then the furthest
run away you would probably be fine so
thank you for checking out my unboxing

series modules as well as their new Ram
fan and thank you for checking out my
