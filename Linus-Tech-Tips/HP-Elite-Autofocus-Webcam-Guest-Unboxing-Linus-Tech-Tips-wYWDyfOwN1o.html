NCIX tech pair of you're actually going
to have a guest on boxer who picked up
this pretty sweet deal at the show it
was when 1299 and I got it solely sexy
knowledge brutally and it's only 12
bucks what great deal bull pups at the
show so I'm going to get you started and
then I'm going to let you take over and
you can tell me what's special about
this particular HD webcam and I'm going
to be in a guy any what a night for a
pen or something sharp in the audience
over there because I'm dying here aqui
thank you alright so let's get this
opened up here and I have done
absolutely zero prep on this product
because I didn't know that I was going
to be doing this unboxing until three
seconds ago so this is their lead webcam
with autofocus it uses their HP instant
at video and photo buttons oh cool
wasn't there and let's get the Box
opened up before we get too much further
away here hey check it out look at that
we're plugging YouTube two at the same
time they should be happy about that
yeah actually they probably won't know
this man alright so you know what I'm
going to let you cover all of the
included accessories that come with this
product so what you got here is you got
your drink on scotch well you got you
got the handle right here and a Celtic
focus on the back so here's a camera so
and it shoots on the 1080i so it can get
up to 30 frames a second standard you
don't you don't really expect to get up
to about 60 frames especially with the
webcam
but it seems pretty nice pretty nice
build now what's what he wants when he
get it on back it should everything I
think it would be great if I know how
they do it so we got here put that now
for a second you got yo usual yes
because of the driver CD but what do you
do in the driver CD
yes you know he got downloaded off the
website get the update driver get the
latest updates birth so find us you got
it that's how it goes all right there
like a little robot so this is one of
the more versatile stands i think i've
seen in the last little while took this
up so you can put it on your notebook
like this you can adjust it wherever you
want it to go it's got a nice rubberized
soft touch mount so you're not going to
scratch your notebook or anything like
that you also appear to be able to mount
it on your desk like that if you see fit
maybe like that I don't know it goes
anywhere look at this thing yeah it also
has a very very flexible neck so you can
turn it this much this much this much
and over there for some reason I don't
know why you can do that but last but
not least there's those buttons we were
talking about video photo and something
else let's see if we missed anything I
would imagine that it would be great for
skites as Microsoft
including face tracking and 3 megapixel
sensor as well as an integrated stereo
microphone so thank you for watching
