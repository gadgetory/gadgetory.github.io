when computers had character I mean
these days we've got flashy RGB and
tempered glass but is it not all the
same standardized parts and standardized
operating systems running off a
standardized box maybe maybe it isn't
Mack Walden makes great underwear
t-shirts socks wallets and more they
believe in simple shopping and if you
use code tech tips you'll even get less
expensive shopping with 20% off you'll
find the link below for those of you who
don't recognize it this is actually a
one-to-one design copy of the original
Apple to this Steve Wozniak designed
machine that was ubiquitous in the
United States in the 80s and 90s to give
you a bit of context for how important
this computer was the Apple 2 was
produced for over 17 years starting in
1977 meaning that this may well have
been the first computer for a literal
entire generation of students during
that time so the successful funding of
Jaffe Wang's IndieGoGo campaign to
revive it as a modern fully TX computer
case shouldn't raise too many eyebrows
but is this thing any good well why
don't we take a quick tour of it our
unit is a prototype made primarily from
3d printed resin but it has all of the
features that are going to go into the
final design the most prominent of which
being an integrated 68 key poker cherry
MX blue keyboard which looks
satisfyingly authentic but I do have to
ask was anybody really asking for the
elevated keyboard design to make a
comeback here fortunately you don't have
to use it just do that so let's move on
then we've got a power button and they
actually somewhat difficult to reach
front USB 3 and headset jack set on the
lower right here and then just like on
the original on the top we've got this
removable panel giving us a look there
we go
under the literal hood of the chassis
itself so in here we find 6 60
millimeter
fans for exhaust along this side and
this side and then we've got two 120
millimeter fans over here as intake
which I would think should be more than
adequate getting it open right up here
hardware compatibility is a bit of a
mixed bag though so we've got full ATX
support for our motherboard here you can
you can see that here the length is
right but we're confined to small
form-factor territory for expansion so
that means a single dual slot opening on
the rear for our DP u and then just two
two and a half inch drive mounts which
on this revision of the design are
mounted right here directly under the
keyboard cooler clearance is another
consideration for this case it's got 82
millimeters of total clearance and yet
another thing to keep in mind
it supports only SFX not sfx l power
supplies meaning that the best that we
can cram in there is of course our SF
600 or a silverstone SX 600 so
installing the motherboard is pretty
straightforward we just need to remove
this cable management shroud at the
bottom right of where the board goes and
our rise in test bench complete with a
knock to a low profile cooler with a 92
millimeter fan on the bottom should slot
in a little something like chill ammo
you've got an extra standoff in here
Anthony that's like Intel boards only
when's the last time anybody put those
in it's ok as long as the board didn't
die for the power supply we ran into a
small issue though in the default
configuration which would have had it
mounted
like this using this grill right here as
an intake for the power supply our power
connector coming out the back was gonna
interfere with our RAM slot see now one
remedy would be to use a right angle
connector but honestly we thought it
made more sense to just carve out this
little area on the bracket right here so
that we could mount the power supply the
other way around this gives it lots of
clearance something that I'm sure will
be fixed by the time you guys deal with
it is the weird coloring for the front
wires this is the kind of stuff we deal
with when it comes to early units
sometimes it's like white black and red
yellow and then which ones positive
negative it's kind of a flipping coin
moving on to the GPU to keep the form
factor low profile enough to maintain
the original computers dimensions we
needed a PCI Express riser for our
graphics card this is another thing that
I would like to see improved in the
final design right now it just kind of
sits here so you kind of slot the bottom
of the card in over here it just doesn't
fit spectacularly well then at the back
you've just got this like two pieces
that you're gonna kind of screw together
to clamp it on there kind of thing it
just kind of hangs there but maybe they
could do some work on that later I mean
overall the looking at it the layouts
not bad let's get it wired up I don't
know what they were thinking with this
cable shroud what's the point of it I
think I think that makes sense yeah
gotta install our SSD we actually had to
remove this mount because we had trouble
closing the case with it in place but
you know there's still time to fix those
kinds of things in future Hardware
revisions ok this wire is a problem how
that's that will reach oh just about
lost my screwdriver bit in there okay
powering it on as expected with the 60
millimeter fans it is a little noisier
than I'd like and that is even without
the included fan controller that made
them louder than just using splitters
and then headers off the motherboard so
let's get a stress test fired app in
summary building in this thing is a lot
easier than finding and then modding an
old Apple - for modern hardware but it's
still kind of a pain and as expected the
60 millimeter fans combined with the
authentic but not super effective slot
design back here means that pretty much
as soon as you start up a 3d load you're
going to be generating a fair bit of
noise so for cooling our CPU hit 74 to
75 degrees under load so you can expect
to see a little bit of boost but our GPU
hit its thermal threshold at 84 degrees
and dialed back its boost clocks now
considering you are using a low profile
CPU cooler with its 120 millimeter fan
removed this isn't too shabby but I have
seen better results in smaller cases
which brings us then neatly to the
conclusion if it wasn't clear from the
start let me spell it out for you here
this is a niche product with niche
appeal absolutely not for everyone and I
guess that's reflected in its small but
enthusiastic community that allowed it
to be funded over on IndieGoGo the
product needs some tweaking before it
hits mass production especially when it
comes to ease of use in acoustics but if
you can live with the cost and the
compromises and there will be some this
is definitely one of the most unique PC
cases
we've ever seen this video is brought to
you by three value-oriented Rosewill
products the Cullinan MX tempered glass
RGB gaming case features four
pre-installed fans with adjustable RGB
via a remote including four
pre-programmed effects the nebula GX 50
gaming headset features built in RGB
rings on leatherette ear cups and
provides strong bass with clear sound
positioning and the fusion c40 keyboard
and mouse combo features vibrant RGB
backlit keys and in the mouse a
switchable up to 4,000 dpi optical
sensor this combo is designed for PC
gamers as a best bang for the buck RGB
bundle and you can check them out at
Newegg or amazon through the links below
