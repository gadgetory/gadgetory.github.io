that different from the two previous
iterations both of which I described as
engineering marvels and one of which one
an Editors Choice Award so when I got
too many requests to ignore to review
this thing I said to myself okay well if
I'm gonna cover the same product again
for the third time I'm gonna do a couple
of things number one is I'm asking razor
for a keeper unit this time and number
two I'm gonna throw the toughest test I
can at it one that the surface pro 3 a
very widely respected device failed
miserably I'm going to leave my XPS 12
behind for a three-week trip to
Southeast Asia and bring only the new
blade to see if it's as suitable as an
ultra portable gaming rig slash
workstation as my previous test drives
would indicate that it would be or if
it'll end up grinding my gears until I'm
forced to just to stop using it since
it's my only choice for a computer
Intel's new 750 series SSDs utilize the
nvm II standard providing speeds never
before seen on consumer storage drives
click this laptop or here to learn more
so I worked on the general overview for
this review in Singapore which I would
describe as Asia with training wheels
for Americans it's hot and humid there's
a lot of Asian people there and the
availability of Burgers and Fries is
pretty limited compared to chicken rice
but all the signs are in English and
most of the toilets I encountered had
seats anyway just like its predecessors
the blade 14 2015 features a hyper thin
aluminum unibody design with only a dual
fan intake hinge exhaust cooling
solution and a couple of long rubber
feet adorning the bottom a simple
illuminated Razer logo on the top and
otherwise a very clean and beautiful
design that is without completely
forgetting functionality so while the
unit is thinner than a dime as razer
loves to say it's still got three USB
3.0 ports and an hdmi 1.4 output to go
along with a headphone / microphone jack
power plug and lock on the sides
front-facing speakers and razor's
trademark solid and satisfying chiclet
style keyboard complete with weird
typeface and unnecessary twenty levels
of green backlight adjustment some of
the stuff about it is not unnecessary
though the Wi-Fi coverage was so spotty
in the house where we were staying in
Singapore that I ended up upgrading
their access point but the good news is
the blade dropped fewer connections than
my other mobile devices from the start
and while the screen could take some
pointers from Apple to be usable in the
car since higher brightness is required
to compensate for the bouncing types of
reflections caused by vehicle movement
it was definitely suitable for
stationary use outdoors near the famous
symbol M square tech ball and while
lounging in the yard with the parrot who
lives there but it's time to move on to
my next part of this video as well as my
next destination Brunei where thanks to
some lazier days when my son got sick I
spent most of my computer time replying
to emails or watching movies the latter
of which led to a couple
observations about the blade on the
subject of the screen I'm still really
not sure how I feel about the 3200 by
1800 resolution it's harder to drive
natively than a theoretical 2560 by 1440
panel would be and requires very
aggressive scaling to be usable for most
people
razor actually sets it to 250 percent
out of the box but viewing angles motion
blur colors and of course smoothness of
on-screen elements without anti-aliasing
are all solid selling points and maid
watching videos on the device really
enjoyable but that didn't impress me
nearly as much as the time I pulled the
HDMI cable out of our hosts satellite
box and plugged it into the blade so
everyone could watch Penguins of
Madagascar and it took me until halfway
through the movie to realize the TV
didn't support audio over HDMI and we
were actually listening to the laptop
speakers the entire time a fact that
made me happy then but continues to
infuriate me actually it turns out razer
does know a thing or two about audio
product engineering which makes it that
much more tragic that they insist on
their gaming tuned headphones and
headsets when it's obvious that they can
do better but I guess this is doomed to
remain a philosophical agree to disagree
point and since Razer is mint and
company and not mine I guess they'll
keep doing it his way until I enter an
agreement with them to do a limited like
Linus Edition run of Kraken forged
headphones that actually sound good or
something actually that'd be kind of
badass then if you're watching we should
do that another thing I noticed in
Brunei since it was the only time on my
trip where I used the blade fairly
extensively without a wall plug I ended
up waiting around an hour during a
ladies trip to the salon and did a fair
bit of writing in the car is that this
aspect of the device has improved a lot
to the point where while on the original
blade 14 battery life was good
considering the other positive points of
the product now I'd actually call it a
fairly strong point I was able to work
in airplane mode for anywhere from four
to up to almost six hours in a light
Productivity setting definitely some
that pleases me gaming well you're still
going to be looking at a little over
that you know our mark unless you're
using some pretty aggressive Nvidia
battery saving features like capping
your FPS at 30 or something along those
lines the good news about which is that
thanks to its 970 GPU it does support
that feature but I still consider it
mostly a mobile workstation and you're
going to want to plug in if you want to
do any kind of extremely long gaming
session in Malaysia
our next stop our host had one of those
four G mobile hotspot internet plans so
I was able to use the blade to get
racket advice with my helper at the mall
then I was able to use it again and oh
wait no I didn't our hosts 4G data cap
got wrecked by having six houseguests so
even though my brother-in-law was giving
me crap about why are you pulling out
your laptop in the you know upside-down
house and this cool castle slash Church
thing in Malacca where there's no Wi-Fi
I persisted in at the very least I got I
hope some neato shots of it sitting on
the stone walls of the church and wow I
sure wish Brandon had been there cuz
with his knack for b-roll I'm sure that
these shots would have been better but
he's just plain too expensive to take
with me on a trip like this so whatever
the last stop of my vacation was
Thailand and while my plan was to
finally find some time to game on the
bloody thing since I finally had decent
or at least consistent internet without
giving too much detail travelers
diarrhea totally sucks and I spent most
of my mere two days in Phuket in bed
sleeping off the wicked headache that
came along with it so I guess all that's
left is the conclusion about this
notebook again there are some small
things that definitely became bigger to
me now that I'm using it as a daily
driver versus when I was just using
review units
I'd like a wider opening hinge full size
up and down arrow keys seriously please
fix this a larger trackpad with larger
buttons that go to the edge of the
laptop so that I can just kind of
casually lean against the bottom of the
laptop rather than like really
intentionally pressing it when I'm using
it two handed and while I'm dreaming how
about a I don't know
lightly more fingerprint-resistant
finish but that's about it they fixed
the crummy RAM capacity the last gen and
they beefed up the graphics what's not
to love it's powerful enough that I can
do any kind of work or gaming I could
want while on the go it's portable
enough to be practical something I value
a lot as someone who used to carry a
thick gaming notebook everywhere and
honestly if you're into that kind of
thing it gets a lot of compliments
people were we were staying with
security checkpoint officers you name it
people kept asking me what that cool
laptop was too bad their jaws all
probably collectively hit the floor when
they looked it up later and saw how much
it costs but that's the price you've
always had to pay to be on the bleeding
edge and in the case of the blade 14 I
know at least some of you will decide
it's worth it even if it has no land
port and I have to carry a dongle with
me all over the place but I guess it's
not like I can travel without a certain
number of extra essentials anyway like
the great bathroom supplies from the
guys at dollarshaveclub.com
for a few bucks a month you can get
high-quality razors straight to your
door so you always look good and okay
I'm not going to focus on the razors on
this spot today too much because one
wipe Charlies need a spotlight here I'm
gonna confess I left for my trip to Asia
with out some of the travel packs of one
wipe Charlies which was a huge and brown
mistake there's no toilet paper at all
in public bathrooms and some of
Southeast Asian countries with the
expectation being that you'll shoot
water from a hose at your butt and hope
you don't manage to make some kind of a
mess a pack or two of one wipe Charlie's
would have been way better
anyway that's dollarshaveclub.com slash
linus during the club now shave time and
shave money and shave your butt I guess
or yeah the whole save sounds like
shaved thing doesn't really work as well
in that instance or maybe it does anyway
