laughed out loud when I first opened up
the box for the Z box Pico from ZOTAC I
mean not a throaty yeah ha ha ha that
might have attracted some unwanted
attention in the office but definitely a
chuckle I just couldn't believe that
they got a whole computer into this
Coolermaster Neptune series CPU coolers
are available in a variety of radiator
sizes to perfectly suit your next build
click now to learn more so this is the Z
box Pico it features a quad-core 22
nanometer until atom Z 37 35 F that runs
at a nominal frequency 1.3 3 gigahertz
but can turbo boost up to 1.8 3
gigahertz it's got 2 gigs of soldered
ddr3 low power memory running in a
single channel config Intel HD graphics
built in Wireless ended Bluetooth and a
32 gig emmc SSD that can be expanded
with the built-in micro SDXC reader for
storage moving along the outside of the
unit aside from that card reader you'll
find a power button that lights up the
top with a very pleasing ZOTAC logo a
ten hundred Ethernet port 2 USB to ports
and a headphone jack and then finally an
HDMI port another USB 2 port and power
in overall I'm mostly pleased with the
specs it's obviously not the most
powerful PC in the world but you get a
full x86 computer in an enclosure the
size of a couple of stacked smartphones
and i/o is ok you get a surprising
number of ports considering the size of
the unit but USB 3 and Gigabit LAN would
have been nice to have and a microphone
input is in my mind a must-have
considering this baby's power efficiency
and included vase a compatible mount
just screams use me as a basic PC for
mom to use for Skype and whatnot a USB
headset is an option but it will add
more cost to this basic setup that could
have been better spent on a more
powerful PC if we were going to spend
more money on it anyway on the other
hand that more powerful PC might be
significantly more expensive than the
zotac ZBOX Pico because this is by
far the least costly computer I've ever
touched that comes preloaded with a
fully licensed copy of Windows 8.1
don't let the with bing bit scare you
away either all it means is that Bing is
the default search engine something you
can easily change on your own in two
seconds
other than that it's the real deal full
windows 8.1 experience unreal you'll
have about 18 gigs of space free on the
boot drive once you set up Windows
install some alternative browsers and
whatnot
so the first thing I decided to do of
course was use up some of that space by
installing 3dmark I mean it's all well
and good if ZOTAC crammed the hardware
in there but especially given that this
baby is passively cooled by a little
strip of aluminum around the outside I
wanted to see what kind of temperatures
we'd see on that heat sink if we started
pushing it not bad I mean the outer
housing we measured it with our IR
thermometer really didn't get that hot
and even more impressively at the wall
that's all the power draw we got I mean
I guess I should have seen the
efficiency coming when I noticed that
the included power brick is a tiny and B
only rated at 5 volts 3 amps or a total
of 15 watts but I guess if you've made
it this far out of the video and you're
kind of suitably impressed by all of
that you might be sitting there nodding
along going oh yea Linus that's cool or
whatever I suspect there's also a good
chance but you're sitting there asking
yourself well on a second who the heck
is this product actually made for to
which I would answer great question as
oh tech has pictures of business people
slipping them into their pockets but I
think the idea of you know jain
businesswoman abandoning her laptop to
carry a pc in her purse that while tiny
on its own also needs to be accompanied
by a battery input devices and a display
to make it even somewhat useful is sorry
ZOTAC frankly ridiculous but that
doesn't mean it's useless either though
a couple much more likely uses for a
silent compact and expensive PC that
comes preloaded with what would normally
be $100 OS on its own would be a basic
PC for our family member who doesn't
need a powerful computer or a media PC
box now arguably a chromecast
or Android stick of some sort would make
more sense for most media streaming
applications but one key feature that
those are missing is steam in-home
streaming support with the built-in
h.264 decoder and a gaming PC somewhere
else in the house you can stream games
to yourself check out this video for a
more in-depth look at steam in-home
streaming it's a really cool technology
and I think that even though this Pico
dropped too many frames for me to really
recommend buying it for this purpose
today a hypothetical Pico - should be
able to handle this kind of streaming
really well and I'm excited for the
future
speaking of streaming by the way guys if
you aren't satisfied with being tied to
your computer or TV to watch your
favorite Network TV shows then Hulu Plus
is our sponsor for today and they could
be the service for you Hulu Plus is the
only streaming service that gives you
access to new currencies and episodes of
shows like American Dad and Bob's
Burgers through your smartphone tablet
Roku chromecast or pretty much any
device you already own you also get
access to every season of shows like
community and Parks and Recreation as
well as kid shows and hundreds of
criterion movies their service is
reasonably priced at only $7.99 a month
but they have a special offer going on
for Linus tech tips viewers or honestly
really anyone else who does Hulu Plus
sponsorship spots so you know you could
use someone else's but we'd really
appreciate a few hours it's crazy you

that's Hulu Plus comm slash Linus to let
them know that we sent you and get in on
