again so we've we've stocked up
everything in our warehouse and we've
got all the open box and refurb stuff
with like crazy markdown prices you can
see that a lot of this is new so it has
like the first tag on it whereas some of
this stuff that didn't sell last time
we've marked it down even further so
let's let's cruise along here and have a
look at some of the stuff that's going
to be available I mean we've got cases
as low as looks like about 25 bucks
we've got of course our 800 deed for a
hundred and eighty dollars moving down
here there's actually a lot of cases not
quite as many monitors as there were
last time but here it is sort of monitor
land so Kara let's just pull out a
couple random things so there's a
23-inch for a hundred and twenty bucks
we've got a 23-inch for a hundred and
nine dollars that's a samsung monitor so
here certain if you want to get the full
scope of all the monitors that are lying
back all the way down here there's old
stuff new stuff all kinds of different
monitors over here's motherboards and
graphics cards so let's see if there's
any sort of cool stuff in here we got
like a saber tooth for a hundred and
forty bucks
tons of P 6 X 58 DS some P 55 boards
lots of graphics cards so there's
actually four fifty nine 70s available
for only $400 which is just ridiculous
although the video cards I think are
limit of one per person there was a sign
here earlier I'm not really sure what
happened to that but so yeah
motherboards video cards I saw a box of
hard drives somewhere but I guess that's
oh it's over there somewhere okay so
over here we got some power supplies we
got let out some coolers just sort of
tons of random neat stuff I mean here
it's even like me nunchucks for 6 bucks
because why not right this table seems
to be quite random like some external is
this an external media player thing from
Lissy moving along to here we got like
photo frames some Windows 7 tablet PC
this is actually the unit that I unboxed
and then did my impressions video on its
v1 so it might even have like my brow
history in it heaven forbid there's a
couple notebooks there wow those are
pretty dusty like what are these so
these are gonna be probably older models
and n 90s V it looks like these don't
have pricing quite yet not everything is
done as of the time of filming this
here's like box o hard drives I mean
we've got pretty cool stuff in here
two terabyte black drive I don't know
re four those are enterprise drives
that's pretty sweet
enterprise storage look at that this
isn't even factory recertified is it Wow
cool so you win if you buy one of those
then okay more hard drives more hard
drives
lots of hard drives as you can plainly
see look at this we've got one terabyte
drives for $39 and these are certain
these are certified prepared but
remember they do still come with a
warranty from Seagate we've got some
shuttle bare-bones pcs here's an Acer
easy store Home Server this is actually
pretty cool comes with a one terabyte
drive I'm a big fan of Windows Home
Server as you guys may or may not be
aware here's some NCIX pre-built pcs so
these were probably cancelled orders or
something like that and these are Wow
Wow like look at this one this one's
like stupid core i7 930
H 50 water cooler six gigs around GTX
480 and Thecla 1200 case for like less
than $900
that is one smoking gaming rig for 900
bucks so yeah whoever comes in and needs
a system buy this pretty much over here
we got printers and lots of printers
actually there's more over on the right
so it's like wall o printers this is all
notebook bags and you'll find out why
there are so many notebook bags in just
a moment because we are going to find
ourselves in notebook land so here there
are tons of notebooks particularly a
bunch of sony ones so there's really
cool stuff here like z series sony vaio
notebooks
pretty cool like that what is this Z no
hold on z520 is the processor you know
these are the P series yes so these are
pretty cool very very low power
consumption high battery life very
compact more Sony so you can see there's
like Sony re lots of Sony refurb
notebooks so let's see what do we got
we've got like $300 notebooks 450 here's
a $450 notebook with a core 2 4 gigs of
ram a blu-ray reader and as well as
dedicated video for 450 bucks so it's
just retarded pricing utterly stupid
here's more notebooks ok lots more
Sony's as well as imma sue some gateway
some lots of other things in here and
then finally moving around to this side
more notebooks so yes there are tons and
tons of crazy price notebooks at the
warehouse clearance event and we also
have some projectors so whoever shows up
go go for these projectors if you need
one this is a w 1000 plus for $4.99
that's a $1,200 projector and yeah the
drawback is that it happens to be open
box there's also a W 1000 if you get
here a little bit after the guy who got
the W 1000 plus and if you don't mind
720p there's a W 600 for only $300 so
yeah that's the that's the warehouse
sale if you do live in the Greater
Vancouver area then yeah come check it
