again so we've we've stocked up
everything in our warehouse and we've
got all the open box and refurb stuff
with like crazy markdown prices you can
see that a lot of this is new so it has
like the first tag on it whereas some of
this stuff that didn't sell last time
we've marked it down even further so
let's let's cruise along here and have a
look at some of the stuff that's going
to be available I mean we've got cases
as low as looks like about 25 bucks
we've got of course our 800 deed for a
hundred and eighty dollars um moving
down here there's actually a lot of
cases not quite as many monitors as
there were last time but here it is sort
of monitor land so care let's just pull
out a couple random things so there's a
23-inch for a hundred and twenty bucks
we've got a 23 inch for 109 dollars
that's a samsung monitor so here so if
you want to get the full scope of all
the monitors that are lying back all the
way down here there's old stuff new
stuff all kinds of different monitors
over here is motherboards and graphics
cards so let's see if there's any sort
of cool stuff in here we got like a
sabertooth for 140 bucks tons of p 6 x
58 DS some p55 boards lots of graphics
cards so there's actually 459 70s
available for only four hundred dollars
which is just ridiculous although the
video cards i think are a limit of one
per person there was a sign here earlier
I'm not really sure what happened to
that but I see I motherboards video
cards i saw a box of hard drive
somewhere but i guess that's oh it's
over there somewhere okay so over here
we got some power supplies we got what
else some coolers just sort of tons of
random neat stuff i mean here's even
like we nunchucks for six bucks because
why not right this table seems to be
quite random like some external is this
an external media player thing from lucy
moving along to hear we got like photo
frames some windows 7 tablet pc this is
actually the unit that i unboxed and
then did my impressions video on its v1
so it might even have like my brow
history in it heaven forbid there's a
couple notebooks there wow those are
pretty dusty like what are these so
these are going to be probably older
models and n 90s V it looks like these
don't have pricing quite yet not
everything is done as of the time of me
filming this here's like box so hard
drives I mean we've got pretty cool
stuff in here two terabyte black drive
um I don't know re for those are
Enterprise drives that's pretty sweet
enterprise storage look at that this
isn't even factory recertified is it Wow
cool so you win if you buy one of those
then okay more hard drives more hard
drives lots of hard drives as you can
plainly see look at this we've got one
terabyte drives for thirty nine dollars
and these are certain these are
certified prepared but remember they do
still come with a warranty from seagate
we've got some shuttle bare-bones pcs
here's an acer easy store home server
this is actually pretty cool comes with
a one terabyte drive I'm a big fan of
windows home server as you guys may or
may not be aware here's some NCIX
pre-built pcs so these were probably
cancelled orders or something like that
and these are wow wow like look at this
one this one's like stupid core i7 930
h50 watercooler six gigs around gtx 480
antec 1200 case for like less than nine
hundred dollars that is one smoking
gaming rig for 900 bucks so yeah whoever
comes in and needs a system by this
pretty much over here we got printers
and lots of printers actually there's
more over on the right so it's like wall
Oh printers this is all notebook bags
and you'll find out why there are so
many notebook bags in just a moment
because we are going to find ourselves
in notebook land so here there are tons
of notebooks particularly a bunch of
sony ones so there's really cool stuff
here like z series sony vaio notebooks
pretty cool like that what is this Zeno
hold on z520 is the processor you know
these are the p-series yes so these are
pretty cool a very very low power
consumption
hi battery life very compact more sony
so you can see there's like sony lots of
sony refurb notebooks so let's see what
do we got we've got like three hundred
dollar notebooks 450 here's a four
hundred and fifty dollar notebook with a
core two four gigs of ram a blu-ray
reader and as well as dedicated video
for 450 bucks so it's just retarded
pricing utterly stupid here's more
notebooks okay lots more Sony's as well
as imma sue some gateway some lots of
other things in here and then finally
moving around to this side more
notebooks so yes there are tons and tons
of crazy price notebooks at the
warehouse clearance event and we also
have some projectors so whoever shows up
go go for these projectors if you need
one this is a w 1000 plus for 499 that's
a twelve hundred dollar projector and
yeah the drawback is that it happens to
be open box there's also a w 1000 if you
get here a little bit after the guy who
got the W 1000 plus and if you don't
mind 720p there's a w 604 only three
hundred dollars so yeah that's the
