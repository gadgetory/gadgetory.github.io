hey hey so welcome to the Wynn show we
have awesome topics that we can
hopefully talk about on a microphone
that is functional this week yeah to
companies that start with V have been
shut down which will be two separate
topics one of them was vine and the
other one was vessel so if you're
starting a company in 2016 maybe do not
name it with a V at the beginning see
Linus Media Group perfect name really of
the naming scheme doesn't start with a V
perfect name for a company there's
actually no V in the whole name nope
what else probably what like really
shows your craftsmanship crash of that
name but after that there was also
announcements from two different
companies that sound like they were
announcements for products from the
other company there was a laptop and an
all-in-one PC announced yeah Microsoft
and Apple and I don't know like which
one was from who yet somehow we'll just
leave the guessing game to you until
later in ciao
parfaits
cable cable bowed down in and in and and
and and and and and and in a cable Maude
huh I'm actually listening to us like
yell out the sponsor names behind the
music right now because I'm actually I'm
actually monitoring the stream which
with the delay on twitch is actually
ought to be a nightmare incredibly
distracting oh um I thought you plugged
into the computer I was like why are we
delaying so much it makes so much more
sense now no I'm listening to it here
cuz I really really need to know if this
cable was the problem and if it turns
out that this USB cable was the problem
I would personally destroy it yep on
stream yep before the show is over him
so a lot of micro USB died in the car
once and Emma was sitting beside me and
I ripped it in half with my hands
because I was so mad that's pretty good
it was so pissed off you're like nedelin
I wrapped one around each hand and then
pulled it apart oh um I can't remember
what it did it like failed me in some
way I'm gonna try it's really different
this is like hard sleeved and stuff yeah
I'm gonna try anyway
I wouldn't mine was like thin and I'm
still gonna try okay I don't mind I
don't mind failing on camera it was good
not a new thing for me
is it still working it's oh yeah oh yeah
it still works probably the cable then
yeah probably the cable I'm gonna turn
our mic down a little bit here cuz I
just grabbed another microphone without
actually like checking any of the
settings whatsoever what is is this the
same mic we just changed the cable not
the mic this was a second oh wait this
was a different mic though yeah and
we're testing you put it over there so
that's probably why it's so we'll go
ahead we'll do that yep
alright so why don't we jump right into
our first topic here umm oh this is am I
am I on the wrong am I on the wrong doc
no no actually this is terrifying just
yeah okay so the original article here
is from the verge oh speaking of
terrifying I have not put in check my
screen share yet
today Donna dentists if it works
I'm excited oh oh ok no it's fine I
thought I thought I thought it was
shutting down oh hey
first time's a charm when a show
something work always works on time is
nice AT&amp;amp;T - by HBO CNN and the rest of
Time Warner for more than 80 billion so
I've got a riddle for you okay what's
the only thing scarier than a ginormous
corporation that owns all the media that
you consume an even more ginormous
corporation running that owns that owns
the delivery media through which you
receive all the media you consume yeah
yeah yeah this might be one of the only
things on planet earth that I and you
and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump all
all agree on yeah this is terrible yeah
this should not happen it's the worst I
love the I love the sub-headline that
deal includes Batman okay thanks deal
includes the one still somewhat relevant
superhero forewarning Oh for Warner okay
yeah I was like what no no no there are
many other ones they're just all Marvel
yeah yeah um so oh not a ton of D we're
not gonna go over a ton of details here
but news of the merger first surfaced
last Friday and actually there are
almost no notes on this whatsoever
Thank You Colton everything that I knew
off the top of my head was more than
what he had actually put into the dog
here but um
yeah there's one kind of funny thing
where the US government summoned the
wrong Time Warner CEO to like talk about
stuff that they summoned Robert Marcus
the former CEO of Time Warner instead of
Jeff Bewkes who is the current CEO of
Time Warner I can't imagine that that
would be hard to figure out so I'm kind
of surprised that that happened but
either way you would think so this comes
on the heels of other ISPs also looking
to expand their their digital media
footprints and I guess that leads us
pretty well into what will be one of our
biggest topics for today yawn even
though the list of people on earth who
care is definitely less than the number
of people who will watch this video this
has a significant impact on us and to a
core group of our viewers yeah that are
legitimately paying a monthly
subscription fee to view our content
which is which is pretty pretty
unbelievable to us and there are many
many more of them than you guys likely
realize so Verizon is buying Jason
killers video startup vessel and
promptly shutting it down so October
26th which was on Wednesday October 26th
the news broke we found about it at
found found about it found out about it
we found it thank you
this is why I like having you because
like sometimes I sense no make so um we
found out about it on the 26th of
October and the deal is done not just
not just done like vessel comm is
shutting down on October 31st that one
two three four five days three of which
are business days it's gotta be one of
the fastest shutdowns after announcement
yeah ever and hold on a second hold on
no no this is posted October 26th at
5:30 p.m. so
like okay one might know that's that's
still right I still I still have the
numbers right numbers right still I had
make sense no yes excellent um so I'll
try to do a sponsor spot like that that
would be terrible for everyone yeah yeah
us sponsored givers no one would win
poor Nick he'd have you'd have like a
brain tumor um all right so vessel
launched about 18 months ago um what
else we got
it's it's it was helpful for us yeah
well here why don't I why don't I kind
of talk about pre shut down and then you
can go through what's going to happen
post shutdown stro so pre shutdown
vessel launched with the promise of
giving creators um kind of like how what
would I compare this to okay so given
creators a way to provide some kind of
benefit to what they called superfans so
some kind of benefit that would drive
super fans to pay a monthly subscription
for the content and support effectively
support the channels that they watch in
a way that is much more financially
beneficial so more money per view than
ad supported platforms like YouTube
remember YouTube read was not a thing at
the time so the idea was that with a 3 a
5 or a 7 day window viewers who's paid 3
bucks a month for the entire vessel
platform would get early access to all
the content on the platform and some
things about this seemed like a pretty
good idea to me at the time and I'll run
you through some of the reasons so
number one is being able to monetize
views more than the fraction of a cent
that we get for a YouTube ad that was a
big one number two the ability to pull
some of the content and some of the some
of the audience off YouTube yeah we're
we are relying on
the goodwill of Google for our continued
existence was a huge one for us like
Ashley really sketchy massive because it
was I had already dismissed joining
vessel I was done I wasn't going to look
into it and then Google pulled a thing
where they were like okay we were gonna
crack down on creators having native
advertising that they baked into their
videos and like it's going to get real
and if they want to have native advert
and logo in their video that brand is
going to have to go through Google to
buy out all of the different ad units on
that video which logistically how does
that even like for how long like you
didn't even make any sense and so we
were like holy crap
we need something so vessel also offered
us that and for the first the other
thing they offered was one free year to
our viewers yeah which was which I
thought was pretty cool because the way
that I looked at it this was a Silicon
Valley startup and I'm not going to say
that I I saw the platform failing coming
at the started actually like I was like
on board I was like ready to ready to do
this thing but it's a Silicon Valley
startup that's signing a one-year
contract with us are sorry it was a it
was an 18-month contract 18-month
contract I think with the potential to
renew for another 18 months as long as
no parties wanted out so it was like a
three-year contract with an 18 month out
the first year of which would be free
yeah for all of our users yeah so I kind
of looked at it Mike I mean and we were
allowed doing simultaneous content when
it came to like show content or timely
content like wine show and stuff like
that so I didn't think it would hurt
anyone so we worked out a deal where you
know and we were at that time also
looking at ways to make ourselves less
reliant on the pace at which new
technology was being released so that
was right around the time that we were
developing concepts like scrapyard Wars
concepts like
moving vlog concepts let concepts that
did not rely on razor or Apple or
Microsoft to deliver us some new shiny
thing that would drive people's interest
in our videos trying to make it more
personality driven more project driven
you know compensator to is right over
there there's going to be a great video
and did not rely on any single hardware
to be released so that we could like go
viral by dunking it in water for an hour
or whatever the case may be so all these
things kind of aligned for us and we
went oh yeah not to mention that wait am
I allowed to say that okay so what I
don't know can you hint No
so okay long story short through vessel
we were able to make a lot more money
per video than we were without it and
right this is the other thing I had just
signed the deal on the warehouse that we
are sitting in today I had just signed
the deal the mortgage deal on it and
YouTube came out with their thing that
was going to significantly affect our
ability to monetize those videos a very
scary time and vessel offered us the
opportunity to better monetize our
videos right at that moment so I had
like a down payment to make I had a
tenant improvement to do I had to build
an office inside this building I don't
know how much you guys know about like
leasing renting or buying commercial
space but like you're lucky if it's an
empty box because then you save the
money that it would cost to rip out
whatever stupid thing the previous
person put in and get it hauled away to
the landfill so um so there you go and
so now in terms of what happens to
people who are already subscribers you
will be provided complimentary access
through the month of October also known
as like a few days three bucks uh yeah
you were given a refund till the
beginning of October yeah if you bought
an annual sub so you will have hopefully
good been given so many good thing yeah
if you were subscribed through iTunes
which I didn't even know was possible
but I'm sure yeah if you were subscribed
to your iTunes you need to contact Apple
customer support for a refund that's
what you get for subscribing through
iTunes yeah and you will apparently be
receiving an email with instructions and
yada yada yada so if you're a vessel
subscriber check your email yeah ah
basically it got people asking what does
this mean for nerd sports great question
I don't think we know yeah so um we have
a call with go ninety next week which is
a subsidiary of Verizon also an online
streaming platform not an early access
platform and my understanding is that if
Verizon owns vessel but did not keep the
content creator contracts like hours to
produce early access content in place
but did keep the employee contract
presumably to move on to another project
because vessel comm is going away then
content creator contracts that are not
the standard ones like the exclusive
content ones seem to be in kind of a
grey zone yeah so we will have to find
out which or how that works what is
going on with that yeah I some people
are asking what is going to happen in
the future for like viewers that weren't
on vessel honestly but probably nothing
noticeable no so I'll tell you this much
we are not planning to take our seven
days of buffered content and dump it
onto YouTube in one day this would be an
enormous disservice to me
Luke and all the other people who work
on those videos because however many of
you go yeah that would be great I'm
going to binge watch the crap out of
that the cold hard truth is that due to
the way the YouTube algorithm works if
we step on our own video releases with
rapid-fire video releases it
significantly decreases the the
propagation of those videos in people
sub boxes suggested video suggested
channels and all that stuff so we would
basically be significantly and like I'm
talking like we could get half as many
1/3 as many a quarter as many views on
those videos we would be significantly
damaging the impact of those videos by
just dumping them all on YouTube at a
time and having a buffer is really
helpful for us anyways because that
could afford us more time to work on
really super cool stuff like can I
reveal a thing behind me yeah yeah this
thing which you can't absolutely see
that one yeah that is a desk PC part two
so that's that's its current state yeah
I'm not kind of stuff can take a little
bit and an eel toast and it's fine it's
like crawling on the floor and it's not
even even going free uh yeah so I don't
know that kind of stuff
could be awesome so um so yeah I guess
should we take Twitter blitz questions
we've got a we've got no I'm falling
into a chat alright yeah we've got we've
got other people in twitch chat asking
if there's any possibility that we would
look into creating our own early access
platform and I won't say no I I think
there's I think even with a fairly
rudimentary system maybe through our
forum or something like that
I think there are tangible benefits but
we could offer people for like a month
some kind of a monthly fee and we
haven't really talked about how much it
would be I was like you're gonna give
examples of the tangible benefits or not
I'm not sure if we should I don't I
don't I don't know okay so on vessel
right now probably or maybe shortly
after when show there's a video where I
talk about these things so I guess I
might as well just it's just like me
sitting at my
that's what I was recording when you
came upstairs oh yeah so are you just
putting your own vessel yeah it's only
going on vessel that's cool so basically
what we're what we're asking people to
do no I don't think that's them no I
don't think patreon is the answer
because patreon we've talked to them
before about building like an API or
working with the api's that exist for
other platforms to more tightly
integrate so if someone was a patron we
could offer them a coupon code on
teespring or something and they have
expressed zero interest it seems insane
developing those kinds of relationships
and those kinds of benefits which to me
is very frustrating because right now
patreon is basically a money collection
platform and not much more yeah in my
mind yeah because everything that the
creator does as a benefit to their
patrons has to be manually done like yes
you can you can upload a small video or
photo or a post other than that but if
you wanted to do like a merch reward or
a coupon
we're not huge fans of exclusive like
actually constantly exclusive stuff we
like share if we're gonna make something
we generally like sharing it with
everybody and generally and and even if
you were to do like the stuff that you
can't do for everyone like if you wanted
to do at a certain tier like a signed
thing patreon doesn't have like a
fulfillment center partner yeah that we
could just fill an entire box full of
sign shirts with and send it to them but
they don't really facilitate your
ability to to to actually execute these
rewards and it's an inherent problem
with the platform because most of the
creators on it are small-time creators
for whom the burden of signing 200 hats
and then packing them addressing them
remember International shipping is a
bitch okay actually shipping them paying
for all that like the good it is
overwhelming it hurts their ability to
create content
is one of the main reasons that Linus
tech tips does not have a patreon it's
something that we tried for channel
super fund and that in my mind has
largely fallen flat given that like if
patreon had the infrastructure so that
you could more easily provide meaningful
rewards like something like a free
vessel membership at a certain patron
level that would have been really cool
one thing that I really liked was the
teespring discount idea yeah I actually
loved that idea make many tons of sense
because if if you're going to contribute
to a patreon yeah in my opinion one of
my favorite things to buy is like a
shirt yep or like like one thing that
I've been interested in is like the CGP
grey sweater
sure because CGP grey is great and his
feather looks cool and I was like maybe
and I might I'm not sure but like that I
like that kind of stuff because I like
the mitten it show support I mean all
the women in the audience have wet
panties over your commitment oh yeah my
bad I'm thinking about it I just I own
like literally 15 sweaters I really
really don't need any more I just love
sweaters anyways
come on you're bang right now thank you
yeah I actually do like this one I've
been writing the videos more because
it's becoming wintertime slowly anyways
but I'm also wearing shorts so I don't
know what's up with that on what who you
are but yeah being able to give
something like that would be cool and
like like we actually genuinely tried
really hard to get the whole vessel
subscription thing going yeah and like
doing doing things and the other thing
too is doing things that are part of a
workflow yeah um where you could do and
out like an exception thing like
assigned hat once in a while yeah but if
you have things that are automatic like
if I just create my videos and I upload
them here and then a few days later
upload them there and just automatically
my patrons get this stuff early things
that happen automatically help small
time creators um so they didn't really
get any of that done and I think you
know I think if vessel had managed to
figure out partnerships like that or if
they had managed to figure out how to
get their creators really on board with
what they were doing maybe they would
have had success they had a lot of big
creator partners yeah
but it didn't seem like they had a lot
of big creator fall
through and yeah there I think that's
perfect I think a lot of the big
creators saw the immediate knee jerk
reaction of viewers not liking have the
idea of having to pay for something that
they used to get for free and when whoa
I'm not touching that with a ten-foot
pole
yeah when the reality of it is viewers
are now paying for something early that
everyone can still get Fergie and I
think most of our audience eventually
did understand that like it didn't it
didn't change almost anything you still
got like embargo date reviews exactly
when they were supposed to go up you'd
still got a video a day like nothing
ever actually can like YouTube platform
there's stuff that people think is due
to the vessel exclusivity period like
the fact that we tweet about projects
that don't get released for a month
but the reality of it was is that you
were going to complain if I tweeted
about it and then it didn't come out for
three weeks the same as you're going to
complain as if it's four weeks like we
just we do work a fair bit ahead we have
a one-week buffer in addition to the
vessel one week buffer yeah for where we
expect to be at for filming video
there's projects that I will finish and
I don't see go up on vessel for like a
while later because they'll just get
pushed back if they're not timely if
they're a review of something like the
like I think there's the Nintendo
controllers yep I did that review that's
not timely those have existed for a
while that doesn't need to come out at
any specific point in time yeah so I
think those kind of saturated shuffle
the schedule a lot yeah so we'll
prioritize new stuff coming in that's
very important yeah we do it all the
time and and sometimes things just take
a long time so to the water-cooled
PlayStation 4 my first email to a table
to uh be bring a pen sorry my first
email to D Brent saying yo this is like
a dope AF idea you want to sponsor it
was on January 25th of 2015 or 2016
rather yeah 10 months no nine months
whatever that works out too many months
before the release of the video so like
I'm sorry for that but some of the
projects we do are large or longer-term
projects and it just does take some time
and some of them like like I'm
currently I've had a lot of questions
about this lately because then like I
looked at my last personal rig update
and looked at the comments and there's a
comment on there from like two weeks ago
being like so where's part three it's
been like so many months like over a
year uh uh yeah it's very close I have
all the computer hardware parts but in
part two I just did like a
theorycrafting thing where I like showed
people what I was thinking of doing and
everyone hated that for very good
reasons because nothing actually like
really happened in the video so this
time I need one of those theories at
this point they're like gone yeah that
test bench is literally in the garbage
can right now
I'm not kidding it's being taken out
like next week I don't want it anymore
it's gone it's going to be gone I guess
so but I have all the new computer
hardware including the case and
everything everything's ready to go
what I'm waiting on is amethyst points
and I'm not going to explain why do you
know why I don't know why but I know I
should
hahaha squarespace.com Squarespace is
the place to go if you want to build
yourself a sick dope AF sleek website
that looks great on any device whether
it's a laptop a cell phone or a big
ginormous projector screen I don't know
that too many people I don't know that
there are too many people who browse the
web on a projector screen but I feel
like I wouldn't be doing my due
diligence if I didn't find out just how
much of our audience oh my god on a
projector screen how many of them browse
it on internet browse web on projector
yes no and no I don't Oh what do I do
you can just do a poll it's actually
fine okay
kuna so you guys you got it you got to
hit us you got to hit us in the twitch
chat let us know sup so so sup so that
should've been the third option this is
up um they've got 24/7 support via live
chat and email it's only twelve bucks a
month to start and you get a free domain
if you by Squarespace for the year and
they've got lots of great features that
take building a website and may
kit so that normal people can do it and
this is awesome
so my dad has been here helping me with
desk PC and they're involved in this
like construction company project or
like shareholders or something anyway so
the guy who runs the company is taking
advice from a bad IT guy okay so my dad
convinced the guy running it that they
should be in charge of like the outward
marketing okay so the website is kind of
under my dad which like my dad's not not
an expert by any stretch of the
imagination when it comes to like
website CSS no no okay so the
woodworking looks great so other than
your with that said my yeah my dad would
have no trouble with it if it was a
Squarespace site for sure like I can
handle that no problem my mom made a
beautiful website Oh squeeze the salty
IT guy that has the ear of the owner is
like real men have scratch coated
websites so basically he's one of those
IT guys that creates work to keep
himself important you know what I'm
talking about like okay okay I can
understand Squarespace is a wonderful
platform but they don't claim to be a
wonderful platform for everything
they're wonderful platform for most
things why don't I explain what the
website needs to do okay it's a simple
company website who are we what do we do
here are some sample floor plans and
some pictures of some homes and here's
how you get in touch with us okay so he
either should have been done that
website in like an hour or two or should
probably just see Squarespace just like
so so so so yeah one of the great things
about Squarespace is that if you don't
have a dedicated IT guy to go in and
update your website for the
ever-evolving web standards or new
browsers or whatever else the case may
be Squarespace deals with all that crap
for you our Lynas Media Group com
website has a sort of this is sort of
embarrassing we give we issue with
updating we should be putting some of
the new employees on it and stuff but
like basically hasn't been touched since
we put it up and it still works exactly
the way I did when we first
did so when you decide to sign up for
Squarespace which my dad should make
sure to use offer code when to save 10%
mine still says aka slick PC I know
anyone mine still says CEO wait no
that's right sometimes I'm not sure
I thought janitor was more accurate yeah
um we have John we have Dennis we do not
have we do not have the latest threat
yeah wait four four one two wait is my
wife even on that is he falling on their
five hahahaha it's pretty bad
oh it's really bad the other four there
is actually four more I'm glad she
doesn't watch when show there there
there and there
right yeah oh yeah
fresh but so fresh books is the easy use
invoicing software that helps small
businesses use the time that they save
not dinking around in complicated
accounting software to update their
websites and do the actual work that
they need to be doing it also helps you
look more professional when you send
like sleek professional invoices in a
timely manner and you've got like all
your expenses tracked and you've got all
your hours together and you've got all
your like mileage and it's all in all
like looks so pro they've got lots of
great functionality including the
ability to accept payment on your terms
so you can take deposits you can accept
credit card payments through the
platform you can even see when your
customers when your clients receive
bills so when you are whether you're
running a small dance studio plumbing
service a small-time IT repair I'm sure
I'm talking right to many other guys in
our audience FreshBooks is a way to make
your accounting life easier even if
you're not a numbers person especially
if you are not a numbers person what
else is there oh yeah and if you have
any questions is fantastic you can reach
out to their support staff where you
will speak to a real human
immediately no return calls no phone
tree no nothing you talk to someone they
help you which like honestly a big deal
for someone who doesn't have a
background in accounting trying to run a
small business is probably worth the
cost of admission right there just
having someone to talk to about how to
use accounting platforms and software
yeah so if all that sounds pretty good
you can try fresh books completely for
free over at freshbooks dot-com /when
and make sure you type when and how did
you hear about us section for our last
featured spot we've got cable Maude
apparently cable Maude wasn't
disappointed in our last featured spot
on the win show and they have decided to
show off some of their dank AF cables
again so cable Maude you may know them
as the guys that offer custom
individually sleeved like like cloth
style so you can't even see the colors
of the wires at all cabling for PCs but
they also have a bunch of other stuff
these days so they are one of the
leading guys when it comes to RGB
lighting strips
they've got adhesive backed ones they've
got magnetic backed ones which are
superior by the way yeah as long as you
have a case with any steel in it even if
you don't I think you'd probably be
better off taking little metal stickers
and like like permanently gluing those
because the problem with the with
sticking adhesive to the material that
lighting strips are made out of is that
it doesn't stick very well yes in heat
so if you just like put metal on and
stuck them at the magnetic lines nice
they're just I don't know they've got
RGB they've got RGB W so they have
actual white LEDs on the strip so you
don't get that weird rainbow effect
they've got RGB UV so you can have UV as
well as RGB lighting but they've got a
new product and that is their sleeved
external cables so now you can get like
sick like Razer Edition fully have to
plug the cities laughter yeah um like
sick power cables Ethernet cables go
check them out they do custom length
SATA cables they do custom lengths of
all their different sleeved cable cables
they've got a configurator that
you individually choose what color every
individual wire is and they're like
super nice guys I've known the guy who
runs it for a really long time going
back to my days at NCIX so he's just
like a super super good
salt-of-the-earth guys so if you want to
just feel nice about supporting a
company that's like cool people then go
use offer code LTT to get 20% off over
at cable mod.com that's actually a
pretty substantial discount on like $100
is a pretty big deal yeah cool all right
vine vine is gone also shutdown also
shutdown wha womp
so twitter has decided that they now
agree with me why did we create a video
sharing platform for six second videos
when we already had twitter they bought
it like just before it was launched so
more or less yes but I I've never I've
never understood or liked vine I've
always had tons of problems because for
some reason the videos just wouldn't
play all the time I never want to have
the app because they're like I don't
care so I try to load the videos in like
a browser which was supported and then
they'd air out and they just I just
why why does it need to be six seconds I
don't understand and I'm just happy it's
gone screw it I don't care so you'll
still be able to access and download
your vines the website will continue to
be online creators will be notified
before the company makes any additional
changes to the website or app but yep
that is that is pretty much it you know
what on the subject of you saying that
you didn't want to install the app do
you think that part of this is due to
and okay I am going to I'm going to make
something up because it's possible that
someone out there has talked about this
or even use the same terminology that
I'm about to use but I haven't looked
into it at all but do you think that
it's due to something that I'm gonna
call app fatigue okay
like it used to be in the early days of
the iPhone you get excited to just like
download everything yes yeah it was like
it was like holy crap there's an
accelerometer I want like a compass act
we're like oh now I can use my phone as
like a level like like there was there
was an app for for every stupid thing
and your phone was just like like I
remember my first iPhone my iPhone for I
had like pages and pages of apps that's
a good product what does my first iPhone
my first life I don't know why it just
does where is now every phone gets
exactly the same load up load out of one
homescreen worth of stuff so that
everything is close together and
organized I've always been very extreme
on that I could only have one page of
icons thing and I usually don't even
like it being my homescreen because I
like my homescreen just being clean I
just have it off to the side and it's
only one page so for me a big part of it
comes from especially on Android
especially on Android random apps
crushing your bad battery life yeah and
not even like due to the all the amazing
cool stuff they're doing in the
background just due to shoddy coding
practices and Google's complete
inability to prevent developers from
sucking up all the power of your device
and especially prevent them from
reporting that they are not prevent them
but not require them to report that
they're sucking the power do you know
how many times I've like had my an
Android phone just like be hot in my
pocket yeah hot in my pocket pull it out
I've lost 30% battery in the last few
hours I'm looking at it going I go into
battery and it's like Android system
Android OS having consumed everything
and like the screens like 2% like I've
hardly touched my phone that day drives
me freaking crazy so do you think that
part of the motivation for this is
Twitter's question of do we need what is
already a weaker brand to distribute
social media
crap do we need to try to get past the
friction that users have with installing
more app more freakin apps on their
phones and finally there was another
reason one interesting thing is that
almost no one even downloads any apps if
you look at like overall actual
statistics in terms of smartphone usage
yeah the majority of people don't
download any apps I've got a straw poll
for you guys though in the meantime
while he keeps talking it's gonna be
argue app fatigued and I want to hear
from you guys and then getting up - I've
been doing I've been doing way too much
research because I'm currently working
on my review for the pixel I know the
back doesn't look normal it's because I
have a skin on it and yeah the majority
of people that have smartphones don't
download any apps you have to realize
that this is the majority of people and
now the majority of people have
smartphone right so like this is this is
everyone this isn't just you guys I'm
sure the majority of people watching the
show download plenty apps but like we
are probably not even necessarily
getting fatigued but we're probably
getting to a point where we don't want
anymore
we're down to download apps we just want
to download the ones that we know that's
a type of fatigue okay I would argue I
would argue that you experience fatigue
yeah kind of deal cuz I don't want any
new apps I know I just want the apps
that I have to work the way that I
expect them to and I'm down for them to
gain functionality yep and every once in
a while I'll throw something unusual on
like oh I need to do a screen recording
or something okay yeah screen recorder
but the women yeah I'll clean it up
after that's exactly like like when
periscope came out I loved the idea so I
downloaded the app but I didn't really
want to you and I never really used it
sounds like a I know now periscope go
next well it's integrated now yeah if
you periscope stream it like does it
through your Twitter anyways I know but
I'd love to see the periscope app just
yeah why no completely because it's
unnecessary yes that's what I'm talking
about I'm down with Twitter gaining
functionality I don't want to download a
new app for the same freakin thing so
this is something this is another thing
that drives me crazy and this was the
other point that I made when I was
wondering about the motivation and why
dilute
a brand yeah you see this over and over
and over again do I
i I think with cars I kind of get it
because an automobile purchase trying to
section things out a little bit is is
such a large purchase and the the
emotion the way you appeal emotionally
to a car buyer is very different from
the way that you appeal to oh I don't
know someone who's buying in my mind
like a wireless access point that's a
very specific rep and the thing about
and the thing about car brands is that
whether we're talking toy ootah
or lexus they don't they don't seem to
UM say so so for the most part for
better or for worse going back to your
acura with that horrible airbag recall
yeah the actual quality of a Honda
engine is pretty much regarded as equal
whether you're buying an Acura or a
Honda and the same goes for a Toyota
like they don't differentiate based on
the core functionality a2b don't break
down they seem to be trying to deliver a
pretty consistent experience regardless
of whether we're talking about one of
the more premium or a sub-brand the one
that drives me crazy is the brands that
try to differentiate on quality by
having like a main brand like a known
brand and then like a sub brand so a
perfect example of this back to wireless
access points is ruckus if you know
enterprise Wi-Fi you know ruckus ruckus
is like Bond it's probably what you're
using if you have good Wi-Fi reception
in an airport or something and then they
introduced like a lower-end brand aimed
at small businesses called
exclaim I opened up the access point and
it is a ruckus access point with like
one small difference like PCD is the
same most of the internal components are
the same it's basically a firmware
difference and I'm going to looking at
it going why not just have a lower why
try to build a brand from scratch from
nothing why not just have a lower line
like a 100 series and still use the same
brand because you're clearly not
differentiating on quality
if you're trying to have like a
perceived difference because it's the
same product why do this so I'm not
exactly gonna be able to answer this but
fluke 16 says why dilute brands lol but
you have three YouTube channels okay so
really different that's that is that is
more to do with YouTube than it is to do
with us if I could have one channel
called Linus Media Group that people
could subscribe to in one click or I
could have three shows called Linus tech
tips tech quickie and channel super fun
that people could individually subscribe
to that would be perfect yep but YouTube
wasn't designed for that we don't own
the distribution yes of the videos
therefore we need to we got to train to
gain by to control how we can distribute
them as much as we possibly can and the
best way for us to do that is to co
integrate as much as we can if we if you
go to the Linus sex tips channel yeah
and you scroll down a little bit tech
quickie is right there right there you
can watch the videos right there yeah
but the the reality is that the way that
YouTube distributes video to your
subscribers is heavily al algorithm
based such that if you know half of our
viewers weren't interested in channel
superfund let's say every time this this
Linus media group channel dumped a
channel super fun video out it would
increase viewer fatigue and YouTube
would stop distributing our videos and
recommending them to people across the
platform as much yeah the more focused
your channel is the more likely you are
to be picked up by the algorithm and
shared and skyrocket perfect examples of
this that we've seen in the last year
are guys like what's inside every video
is the same formula or the pneumatic
thing yes you crushing things or someone
like techrax
okay you watch a techrax video you watch
a what's inside video you know what
you're gonna get a guy destroying an
iphone in some kind of creative manner
and a guy in his kid cutting something
open and looking at what's inside it and
that allows channels like that to
the kind of explosive growth that we for
better for worse never will because we
try to tackle a broad broad variety but
even then we're limited if we tried to
start doing like pet videos on Linus
tech tips
it would hurt us in a huge way I mean we
experienced recently a big drop in per
video viewership that turned out to be
due to us just having kind of a run of
about five days of videos that were
below viewer expectations in terms of
the interest level and all of a sudden
our new videos as far as we could tell
we're getting delivered to maybe 60% as
many people and so that's why that's why
we do what we do because we have to the
game we're playing what else um okay
multiple lots of people asking about
Dennis so um I got you I I don't know I
don't know how much to say or not say I
guess now that it's over should I just
like be upfront like what happened with
Dennis yeah okay
so Dennis wasn't working here um for a
long period of time actually um
basically what happened and it comes
back to my first conversation with
Dennis where I interviewed him and I
asked him if he had a Canadian work
permit and he said yes and didn't
clarify exactly how long his Canadian
work permit was valid for and anyway so
his Canadian work permit expired so he
had fortunately he still had visitor
visa status so he didn't actually have
to like we permanently leave the country
and go back to Taiwan but Dennis has
been gone while we've been going through
a very very long tedious process that
anyone who wants to hire a foreign
national who doesn't have a work
work visa has to go through and it's
called an lmia it's a labor market
impact assessment and so what we have to
do is we have to demonstrate that the
pivot for the position that we want to
hire in this case we want to hire
dentists that it will not affect
Canadians who are equally qualified who
are also looking for that job or that
those applicants would not be suitable
for us so that whole process took about
six months because we actually began it
long before Dennis's work permit expired
and as of I believe it was as of Friday
last week um I had was it Friday last
week last week I had an interview with
with an agent who was reviewing finally
like it took months after it was
submitted for anyone to even look at it
but I had an interview with the agent
and it really did not look very good but
thanks to Yvonne's diligence because she
documented freaking everything like the
agent was like why didn't you hire this
guy who applied and Yvonne was like Papa
buh-buh-buh okay we emailed him on this
date he emailed back on this date he got
a job somewhere else
the agents like okay moving on to the
next one Lake they dug deep yeah and
thanks to Yvonne's diligence effective
november 1st i believe yeah i dennis is
back yet linus media group oh so there
you have it it has been extraordinarily
stressful for us because dennis is as
you guys know and i'm sure can
appreciate an extremely valuable member
of our team here we take a very you know
no man left behind sort of approach to
things I'm not gonna I'm not going to
like I'm not bragging or anything but
like to me this kind of thing is very
important it cost us many thousands of
dollars to go through this process
in order to make sure that Dennis could
not only get his work permit to work
here but it's also probably the last one
of the last steps for him to get his
permanent residence and officially
become a Canadian so yeah um that's
that's been that's been really exciting
for for me and one and for him so yeah
there you go that is what we have been
the journey of dennis has been very
interesting very quiet about and that's
actually it feels good to get it out
there yes like oh I've addressed on like
my thing but the only thing I've said
the whole time is that he's not working
here right now yeah oh we're allowed to
really say so there you go it it was
really close oh man was it close um what
else we got for topics today oh wow nice
Oh Microsoft janilla oh yeah we haven't
even talked about the Microsoft and
Apple things and it's six makes a
pornhub offers to buy vine six seconds
is more than enough and you know what
considering vines auto loop that might
be true yeah there could be some pretty
creative uh pretty creative x-rated
vines I'm sure yeah I mean money banner
ads for pornographic sites are basically
vines really about it
pornhub has promised to restore vine -
it's not safe for work glory was there
like Nazi for work stuff on vine yeah
okay yeah yeah and then they tried to
clean it up and make it advertiser
friendly and then now they're closing it
hahahaha three in five seconds or less
oh man that's funny all right let's talk
about the MacBook Pro so the original
source here is oh hold on no I want to
do those straw polls before I totally
forget yeah so browse web on projector
you guys are full of crap yeah twenty
two percent twenty two percent projector
sales go through the roof that is
everyone starts making them gigantic
load of garbage everyone watches my dorm
room tech video and they're like wow
yeah every
this video makes sense now okay are you
at fatigued 78 percent of you saying yes
so I have to take these results with a
grain of salt because you guys are a
bunch of freaking liars
no dude 22 percent are not app fatigued
and are watching this on a projector
well projectors you can't install apps
on projectors bogus unless you had an LG
smart projector oh dang alright so
moving on to the new MacBook Pro this
far and with a touch strip along the top
that replaces the function bar I got to
say good move I mean it's not the first
time this ideas ever come up the art
lemma dev optimist keyboard was the
first one to have the same OLED displays
behind every key and you could probably
do that did anyone ever get one I don't
think I ever saw it outside of concept
art but that's like what got me
interested in keyboards yeah so I guess
we got a lot of people interested in
people so so they officially give a crap
about laptops again but they don't seem
to know who they're making them for
because it says right here MacBook Pro
and it's not for professionals as far as
I can tell but this this raises a lot of
questions for me this here because the
13-inch model unless you dock it the
13-inch model I'm docking marks from
Apple that's what's getting docked right
now dang dang ah my egg roll isn't worth
a laptop dock is my scroll considering
the USB sea ports of this thing has wow
those are expensive oh man
every 13-inch MacBook Pro has no
dedicated GPU I'm sorry are you kidding
me 20:25 54 no dead EGP you know I'm
down I get it so you got sold I mean
this is the thing holding now Apple is
the company pre-or that whips out the
GPU performance slide piriform
every time they release a new iPad or an
iPhone and talks about the importance of
GPU heterogeneous compute
for for for the performance of future
computing devices I mean this can
produce graphics and then Intel iris
graphics 550 and then builds a
professional product that goes all the
way up to twenty five hundred US dollars
hold on nowhere on CA ronzi a so let's
be cognizant of that let's try to go to
us and see if that works okay so let's
bring it up with with the u.s. prices
all the way up to dreams thousand US
dollars with eight gigs of RAM and no
graphics card and not a single type a
USB port I'm sold no one will ever need
more than eight gigs of RAM I mean to be
clear you can configure it with more
memory oh but you wouldn't need to so
let's look at the 15 inch which you
could make the argument is more of a is
more of a professional grade do they
even have quad cores holy crap no I've
missed that they don't even have their
drill course they don't even have quad
core processors no one needs more than 2
cores 2 cores 8 gigs of RAM like
anything above that is you're just
compensating I don't even understand
what this product is compensator call it
watch the video is coming out this is
like this is like MacBook Pro for
students and I understand that it's like
lots of students go buy a MacBook Pro so
so basically Apple's given up on because
my whole thing with Apple is that so
much of their marketing in the past has
been around selling what people want to
be and selling what people want to do
versus what they are and what they can
do so like an apple commercial is full
of like all the amazing like videos that
you create when the reality of it is is
it's a very small subset of the
population yep that creates any kind of
video that anyone anywhere would want to
watch also no birds I'm sorry Austin
Evan yeah sure I'm actually like looking
for I guess are you doing a review of
yes I am you are ok yeah I'll look
forward to your video - Wow I'm ready to
see what you guys say about it because
the USB type-c stuff it's actually kind
of interesting losing type a is gonna
suck but I like seeing how many types
sees they
I can disappointed with the fact that
there's no Taipei's what I'll tell you
right now is that I Without Really
realizing what I had done because I
didn't watch the event and I didn't look
that closely at the specs do you order
do a court I ordered a dual-core 13-inch
MacBook Pro so I can tell you right now
my review will contain a a concise but a
spirited rant about how Apple could
possibly believe that dual core is Pro
for anything um yeah so there's that I
forget where I was going with whatever I
was talking about before but for
Thunderbolt 3 ports Babel - what could I
possibly need for Thunderbolt 2 ports
for that I can run with a dual you you
could charge 4 pixels at a time not an
iPhone you can't plug that it don't buy
one first that's my favorite thing oh
man they don't have a first-party cable
I I don't think I well ok there's
probably an adaptor or something like
that but you have to buy it after the
fact I do not believe the iPhone comes
with a lightning to USB C connector no
it doesn't so you you can literally walk
out of an Apple store without being able
to plug your iPhone into yeah but
remember apples vision Apple has the
courage to do away with wires but not
but not the courage to have wireless
charging or the ability to plug their
own products into each other what
happened to like the insanely cohesive
hard to get outta of Mac ecosystem I've
heard it's still hard to get out of but
like they don't even work well properly
you have to get an adapter to plug your
phone into your own Mac laptops wireless
wireless is the future but but it's not
Airport why does he call it Airport are
there planes do you duh I don't know I
don't know gonna say to you dock then I
was like wait nope that's that star
citizen or Eve nope nope nope
umm what are we even talking about right
now okay so Mac right right I wanted to
talk I wanted to talk about the specs of
the 15-inch I I'm like I'm screwed
I can't believe I just ordered a do
that's what for like $3,000 Chancellor
debrand ordered it
oh they're sending it skin like I I
might have to I might have to get in
touch with deer and be like yo well hold
on hold on to it hold on um hold on okay
so dude you can get 16 gigs of memory
that's 2 times the amount that Union
gets even worse okay so the 15 inch has
whopping Radeon Pro 450 graphics oh dang
for 2400 to 2800 US dollars dang two
gigs of VRAM hell yeah I mean this is
realest you don't even get any more
ports I thought they'd give you you know
five at least five thundercutter book
reports you need that fifth one dude you
got to have it I wonder if you could
okay yeah I'm not even gonna bring that
up
do you like okay no I'm interested now
fear it I doubt it because the powers
there's no way the power supply would be
able to take this but could you like
plug it in through all of those ports to
charge us has got to be the stupidest
thing I've ever said but like does it
dynamically know if one of them is
receiving power an alternative receiving
power off on all the other ports I'll be
perfectly honest with you like I said I
did not watch the keynote okay so it's
possible there's like one there's
actually a dedicated charging part yeah
okay sure okay I'll have to look again
like I don't I am wondering if you if
you plug in a bunch of type C devices
and put them all to like charge the
other device is that gonna like screw
the MacBook up or how does that even I
don't think so I've never tried you
should be correctly should be correctly
managed um so yeah I Color Me not
impressed I do not agree that it's a
touch of genius I love the huge trackpad
I love the idea of the dynamically
reconfigurable function row I think that
is a step forward and is a great move I
am NOT a fan of the i/o but hey oh ya
know they do charge via the USB type-c
port so there you go I knew it charged
through that I was wondering how to deal
with the multiple ports yeah um so it
does have a headphone jack at least it
has that going for it yeah it looks
great
it's really thin but I don't I can't
think of a reason why it should be
is thin and give up having a decent GPU
and in the case of the 13-inch a GPU at
all and a proper CPU can I help you at
ICAO titled 8a oh thank you single type
a have you seen his hair whose have you
seen his hair yes sir yes I don't think
you even notice that brief only to come
no no no I don't I don't I don't notice
I don't notice if you get a haircut I
notice if you haven't had one in like
four months and my money's worth when I
get hurt yeah oh is it are you bald no
oh yeah that's good that's good yeah all
right number one so uh what by the way
you guys were right we haven't even made
it through the four topics yet for topic
when show okay let's talk about talk
surface studio all right so we didn't
get to see this so we wanted to go to
the launch for this but we had what like
three days notice us way more notice
than that okay we were just in a
situation where you were right you were
out I had pneumonia yeah so we didn't
have someone to send and we didn't know
what it was gonna be we didn't know that
it was gonna be like other fallen like
machine super and II am sure it was they
were like you should really go it's like
right up your alley but then the only
picture that I had about it said like an
update for Windows or something or like
the future of Windows I think was the
future of Windows and then yeah and then
there was a rumor at the exact same time
that was about another just software
update to Windows so I was like okay so
evidence that Microsoft understands what
the word professional means yeah even
though they didn't even use it but they
are that they have Pro in creative
process
so there's that okay um this is a ball
and machine this thing is super cool
it's expensive yeah to be clear I wasn't
complaining about the price since it
than that group of the MacBook Pro yeah
I wasn't complaining about the price of
the MacBook Pro what I was complaining
about was that has the word pro in the
name if you just called it MacBook and
you just made it like a MacBook for like
people who like MacBook spend sure great
charge as much as you want for it what I
don't like is calling it pro when it
doesn't even have a discrete GPU in it
and it has eight gigs of ram and a dual
core that is not pro that is consumer
that is very consumer grade so anyway
the surface studio twenty eight inch
high-resolution display quad core Core
i7 processor comes with a pen so you can
draw which is freaking cool you can have
up to a four gig gtx 980m GPU which I'm
guessing is only because of the long
development cycle for a product like
this I would expect a refresh at some
point with some kind of Pascal based GPU
to get a 1060 in their GDP wise no
problem up to 32 gigs of ram Thank You
980m I think they could fit a TDP wise
1070 convey no not quite I'm pretty sure
we'd be looking at 1060 okay cuz that's
what we got on blade 14 which had a 970
m but I think 1070 is too much more kind
of thing like it's okay cuz what the
understanding I had was that it was one
down you might be right maybe I'm not
sure though but then like you also said
that the configurability of the tvp's
and those things yeah same so like who
knows yeah so um 4500 by 3000 resolution
display it can handle srgb DCI p3 and
vivid color profiles it's a 10-point
multi-touch it's a three by two aspect
ratio like again people who understand
Pro know that the square display is
actually
pretty badass I would like to see them
have an accompanying display so that I
could have a dual dual display setup
that you can use in the same way yeah
yeah so I could have two three by two
because if that's something you can't
expand the displays with something else
but you can't do the same format you
can't get the same there's some special
functionality that comes with it one
thing that is missing that I would have
liked to see and I know that it's like
not the hugest thing on for PC as I
would have liked to see Thunderbolt
because it is becoming more of a thing
on especially mobile PCs but I still
feel pretty darn good about this and I
love that at least if they're golfing at
least if they're gonna charge a bunch of
money for do something real nice they've
got this really cool like full down
fantastic beautiful display powerful
thing that kind of excites me xbox
wireless built in the fact that it
doesn't include office it's kind of
frustrating I think that that's an
opportunity that Microsoft has to offer
value on their hardware products that in
my mind shouldn't cannibalize I
shouldn't cannibalize standalone office
sales really that much they did it with
the surface RT for example where they're
like this is an awful product what could
we possibly do to move a few units you
get office the one the one app that was
ever made for like arm windows that
matters yeah yeah um so yeah I'm really
dialed forward to checking this out have
we liked the dial thing here are we
getting one we're getting one I haven't
ordered one but we are getting one okay
good yeah all right
just making sure about had a like panic
moment there for the dial thing
oh sorry does it show the dial thing
anywhere is it doubting how does it not
show the dial thing yeh this thing is so
cool yeah have you seen it in the video
so like they put it on the screen
straight up on the screen I don't know
how it fixes itself there I'm assuming
there's a type of like rubbery something
on the bottom because I'm sure it's not
magnets through the screen
I don't know how it works Vegas don't
affect LCDs the way that they did affect
CRT is like it I don't know yeah but I
just I just I doubt it
yeah I don't think so anyways and it can
be used for different things so in one
situation they turn the dial and it
rotates the image another situation it's
a color wheel and you're able to turn
and change the color wheel with one hand
while you like stroke paint with the
other hand so they had gradient paint
going through as the person's changing
it that's really cool very cool
I don't do the art stuff but I like
physical control of things so being able
to turn that to select your color would
actually be pretty awesome
I don't do the art stuff lukla friend
yeah 2060 yeah yeah it's probably pretty
accurate have you seen me trying to do
anything that's artistic yes it's pretty
bad I know I can manage cables pretty
well that's good yeah alright so
speaking of things that we do well
ending the show by rolling the intro

a pretty good track record late yeah
