comparing the camera man's car to my car
I think the camera man wins but that's
neither here nor there actually what
we're going to be talking about is the
gigabyte x58 ud9 this is a very exciting
board which I've received endless
requests to unbox and have a look at it
so let's start with the front of the box
unlocked power with electricity and
lightning bolts all over the place
and for some reason the cameraman wants
me to hold this alright maybe he wants
me to hold it next to the iPhone that's
here all in off charge that's another
really cool feature that we've seen on
some of gigabytes newest boards on/off
charge allows you to charge things via
the USB ports whether your computer is
on or off hence the name on/off charge
so including iPhones iPods whatever else
charges by USB let's have a look what
else do we got here delivers maximum CPU
power with 24 phase CPU power built into
this board we have support for four-way
crossfire X four-way SLI it has a three
year warranty in the US and Canada
supports intel's extreme edition six
core cpus as well as having their three
three three onboard acceleration USB 3.0
three times USB power so that means if
you're using a hub you can power three
times as many devices without plugging
in an additional power adapter as well
as ultra durable three SATA 3 and any of
any other number three three year
warranty there's got to be three of
something else supports i7 i7 extreme
and it's x58 that's three more things
okay I don't know where I was going with
that let's take this piece of cardboard
off and have a look at the board so this
is all basically the same stuff that we
saw on the front it has smart dual lan
so you've got LAN port automatic
switching between the two physical
gigabit lan chips offering hassle-free
zero downtime high-speed network
connectivity hybrid silent pipe - so
that means you can either hook up water
cooling or you can hook up this huge air
cooling heat sink to your board
depending on which route you want to go
more unlocked powered okay and then
we'll run have a look at the back of the
box which is exactly the same stuff
again okay why don't we just open it up
and have a look at this sweet board then
and we'll stop looking at the box
although it is a fairly nice box I'll
definitely give give it like that it's a
very snazzy looking box very shiny I
don't know if you can see this in the
Sun but you see how like shiny it is can
you can you see those reflective little
dot sort of oh that's not what I want
you to like that okay let's open up the
board alright so the first thing we're
gonna find inside here is oh that was
just a teaser the first thing we're
gonna look at is the accessories so in
terms of accessories we should find a
fairly fully loaded package here we have
a 3-way SLI bridge you have a four-way
SLI bridge because both of those
configurations are supported we have the
user's manual as well as the driver DVD
don't use this download the latest off
the gigabyte website we have oh hold on
hold on
congratulations on your Oh neat okay we
have a gigabyte VIP card okay what do
you get register today for a chance to
win an Apple iPad cool okay we have a
gigabyte sticker some extra motherboard
standoffs and I'll explain why we need
those in a minute we have a smart six
users manual as well as a multilingual
installation guide but then on the other
side we have some SATA 6 gigabits per
second cables four of them to be precise
oh wow yeah four okay and then we have
an IDE cable we have two long crossfire
bridges we have an eSATA bracket so this
includes power to eSATA ports and that
all plugs in internally and then a
couple of molex r1 molex to SATA power
adapter so that means you can just plug
in bare drives very convenient for
storage as well as to eSATA
to SATA cables we have an IO shield and
a third crossfire bridge no that's an
esse oh okay that's a straight SLI
bridge these are to crossfire bridges
and then we have three-way and four-way
SLI bridge
so that pretty much takes care of the
entire accessory package for this
particular board and now we will have a
look
finally at the board itself no I'm lying
again okay we're gonna have a look at
the extreme cooler that you can actually
put on top of the hybrid silent pipe
that you can put on top of it this is
the same one that we've seen included
ever since the x58
extreme a sticker that fell off here
okay it supports an extra u connector so
the first thing that you should notice
about this board if you're a very
observant viewer is that it is not a
standard ATX board so right here you can
see a gap between where normally you'd
have the first slot and where the first
slot actually is on this boards okay I'm
just gonna grab a board my ghetto
ancient motherboard that I use to
compare size every once in a while so
we're gonna just put that over top of
the gigabyte ud9 and you can see it's
quite a bit longer on the bottom and
also quite a bit wider so this is sort
of an XL ATX ei TX sort of hybrid form
factor board and yeah so that's the
first thing that you'll notice you'll
also notice it has seven PCI Express 16x
slots although they're not all
electrical 16x so this one this one this
one and this one are all actually wired
for 16x while this one this one and this
one are only wired for 8x next we have
hmm yeah that's pretty cool so that's
the cooler that is going to be cooling
the the Southbridge as well as the nf
200 chips that power this particular
board that's the way that gigabyte was
able to achieve so many PCI Express
slots you can actually populate every
single slot I believe they'll all run at
8x and I don't recall whether it's using
1nf 200 chip or 2nf 200 chips
so if you know the answer to that please
post it in the comments under the video
and I would be eternally grateful so why
don't we start at the CPU socket I'll
start over again this is an LGA 1366
sockets fairly bog-standard as far as
that goes it is a load socket so you
don't have to worry about any problems
with the CPU contacting the pins
correctly if you are concerned about
that sort of thing to the left of the
socket we have two eight pin EPS
connectors so that means you can deliver
a whole lot of power to that CPU through
this motherboard although you only need
to plug in one of them you can see this
little sticker S here supports an extra
CPU eight pin power connector next we
have six ddr3 module slots they are
running in triple channel so the first
ones you're gonna populate are going to
be the white ones and then you'd
populate the blue ones it supports up to
24 gigs of memory our 24 pin connectors
and it's ideal location along the
right-hand edge of the board and also
along the right-hand edge of the board
and I love this you've got your power
and reset switches this is where they
belong
not at the bottom of the board because
whether you're on a test bench or
whether you're in a case it's hard to
get at switches that are down at the
very bottom right of the board this is
always easy to access because it's next
to your RAM where there won't be a video
card or a CPU heatsink overhanging it
perfect Thank You gigabyte good work
next we have yes four SATA three six
gigabit per second ports so the white
ones are color-coded four SATA 6
gigabits per second we have an IDE port
in between them and then we have six
SATA to three gigabit per second ports
running off of the Intel Southbridge we
have an LED diagnostic the display right
here we have our front panel connectors
front USB front USB front USB front
firewire a floppy connector just in case
you are still have a floppy drive and
then we have two additional molex
connectors so one here at the very
bottom left and then one up above the
PCI Express slots and those are going to
be to provide auxiliary power to a super
beefy graphics card configuration that
you might want to plug into a board like
this so let's have a bit of a closer
look at the cool
solution I know we looked at the
Southbridge cooling before I'm not
talking about that chip camera man okay
we had a closer look at the Southbridge
solution before so that's here that's
just a big block of metal basically and
then we're gonna be relying on because
there isn't actually a whole lot of
cooling potential here so if your water
cooling this board only the CPU I'd be a
little bit concerned because there's a
whole lot of stuff here to cool you've
got your SATA six could save the six
chips up down here you got your South
Bridge you got your North Bridge you got
an end f200 or two don't forget to write
a comment if you know you've got your
MOSFETs and that's a whole lot of stuff
and you've only got these heat sinks
right here and that's pretty much it I
mean this doesn't really have any air
cooling potential to it it's got like a
little tiny heatsink in there but that's
not getting any airflow and then this is
just a big block of metal so you either
need to connect the hybrid silent pipe
or you need to connect water cooling to
the Northbridge block right here and
that's what's going to take care of
cooling all of this stuff because it is
all connected via heat pipes so as long
as you cool this spot right here you
make sure you take care of your MOSFETs
as well as all of your chipsets on a
board like this front audio connector is
here and let's have a look at the back
connectivity on this motherboard so
first of all we've got two ps2 ports
personally I think that's necessary
I like ps2 ports they're useful yeah
it's legacy but I don't think it's that
big of a deal next we've got can't
remember once it at this angle for some
reason alright next we've got digital
audio out so we have optical as well as
coaxial we have a clear CMOS switch in
its absolutely idealist possible
location on the back panel you can
always reach that no matter what is
installed on the board we have two
firewire ports we have two USB 2.0 ports
two USB 2.0 eSATA combo ports let me
just double check that that is indeed
what those are yes it is we have two
more USB 2.0 ports two USB 3.0 ports two
Gigabit LAN as well as 7.1 audio out so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the gigabyte X 58 a
ud9
just for scale I'm gonna take the camera
man's eye then again and show you just
how huge this board is yeah that's right
the Southbridge heatsink is like the
size of an iPhone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
