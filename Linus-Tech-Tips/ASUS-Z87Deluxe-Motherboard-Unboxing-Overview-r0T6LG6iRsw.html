usa.com welcome to my unboxing and first
look at the a soos z87 deluxe this is
from their channel series of boards
where you find models like pro and Evo
and deluxe and all those kinds of things
traditionally and they have done a lot
of things differently with this
generation of product on the LGA 1150
platform so these support the latest
fourth generation intel core i3 i5 and
i7 processors code-named has well you've
got full support for nvidia sli and you
crossfire as well as DTS audio so that's
a license that they definitely did have
to pay for I'm also going to talk a fair
bit about the 4 way optimizations
enabled by their dual intelligent
processors generation 4 technology on
the rest of the outside of the box you
know what we're not going to worry too
much about that let's get this thing
opened up so the first thing we see once
we get her open is the motherboard
itself an asus has gone with a serious
departure from their traditional color
scheme on these boards which has been
black and blue for quite some time
now we have a black and yellow and gold
color scheme that looks quite striking
so without further ado let's put that
away next we're gonna get into more I do
which is all this other stuff in here so
we've got an i/o shield Q connectors for
easily connecting your front panel
connectors saw our soft flexible SLI
bridge this is interesting so you guys
are you guys are gonna like this this is
a wireless AC dual band antenna and I've
actually seen a live demo of this
running at in excess of 850 megabit per
second which is very very cool 6 SATA 3
6-game bit per second cables including 3
right angle and three straight cables as
well as a user guide with vented intent
driver disk which you probably won't
need because you're gonna download the
latest from the issues website round out
the accessory package so not as rich as
what you might find on something like an
ROG board but I think that
is expected given that this is a lower
tier of product so I want to clarify
something right from the start this is a
channel board this is not necessarily a
gaming oriented board but that I mean
you he was gonna be an rog board for
that but you're still gonna find great
performance and gaming great performance
and overclocking and all that stuff but
it means that the features particularly
what asus is talking about these boards
are more focused on other things and
that starts right with the power so
you've got your 8 pin CPU power
connector up here at the top left in its
ideal location and you've got a nice
beefy heatsink arrangement with a heat
pipe on the chipset as well as the power
delivery system which is quite beefy as
well next up you're gonna find this
little guy right here this is an e pu
chip and this is where their dual
intelligent processors for really come
into play so it allows you to do a
number of really cool things through the
software you can control things like fan
speed you can control how much power
your system is consuming you can even
set a TDP target so you can set a power
consumption target for your CPU set it
and forget it and the EP you will
automatically go okay yet we'll make
sure that CPU never goes over that power
consumption so you can make your system
more efficient you can do a number of
other cool things with this including
turning off or on certain USB ports when
the system is powered off remember guys
on/off charging has been a feature on
motherboards for a couple generations
now but what if you didn't want all the
ports powered on while the system isn't
turned on what if you had things like
LED lighting as an under global
well now you can actually selectively do
that which is really really cool the epu
also allows you to control a well the
epu combined with the TPU also allows
you to control performance profiles with
the TPU giving you two different tiers
of of overclock performance one of which
is more like a more aggressive turbo
boost and the second of which enables
XMP and starts overclocking all of the
cores concurrently all of this is
enabled by a Seuss's fully digital power
delivery system as well as some of the
other cool things they're doing like
building in only 4 pin fan connectors
which is really neat because it allows
you to take full control of these fans
which can also be
configured as part of that whole system
control so you can control performance
power consumption as well as cooling and
not only that but it has a special away
mode that's going to be able to reduce
your CPU power consumption and detect
when you're not at the computer so that
it doesn't take as much power but what
it does do is allows you to still do
passive things like download or access
files remotely and all that kind of cool
stuff
so speaking of 4-pin fan connectors
there's a special CPU fan connector
that's built into their new generation
of boards that automatically detects
whether you have a three pin or a four
pin fan connected so that it can use
either analog or PWM control for your
CPU fan you've got full support for four
dims of ddr3 running in dual channel and
higher memory speeds are supported the
board supports natively up to ddr3 2800
megahertz which is incredibly cool the
24 pin connectors in its ideal location
along the right-hand edge of the board
and I like to see this more for pins
over on the right-hand edge of the board
so many boards hide all of their fan
connectors like back here and I'm
sitting here going mul who has all of
their fans on the back of their case
nobody there's usually like one there
whereas you often will have a couple
fans on the front of the case and these
can reach them easily your front USB 3
connectors and it's ideal location along
the right-hand edge and you've got 10
say the 3 6 gigabit per second
connectors six of which are powered by
the Intel chipset you've got hardware
buttons built in for your TPU and epu
modes so that's for your energy
efficient processor the EP you and your
TPU
which has one and two so it's actually
got three positions so TPU off TPU one
TPU 2 so those are those multiple
profiles I talked about before you've
got your USB to front panel connectors
two LED post readouts so the potential
here is endless there's all kinds of
four-letter words I wouldn't mind
putting on my motherboard if given the
opportunity as well as a clear CMOS
button allowing you to well clear the C
Mo's you've got built-in power and reset
boards which belong on a high-end board
but are not necessarily you know colored
cool like on the ROG board and located
in a more prominent location because
fewer people are going to be using this
in an out of case sort of environment 7
expansion slots total with 4 PCIe 1
slots and three PCIe 16x slots however
it should be noted that two of them are
going to run in either 16 X or 8 X 8 X
and one of them runs in 4 X so this
board supports two-way SLI or up to
3-way crossfire with a potentially a
performance hit because that 4/3 card is
only going to run at PCIe 4x now this
brings me to one of the things that I
think is coolest about this board so
this Wi-Fi go guy right here it has
built-in wireless AC and I just think
that is really really cool especially
with some of these software things that
Asus has done so they allow you to use
your computer as a Wi-Fi hotspot they
allow you to easily take remote control
of your computer and they allow you to
use the software as a DLNA server and it
enables easy file transfer so this is
all cool stuff that is important to your
your main stream or your channel
customer also on the back of the board
we find that someone put these stickers
on the wrong spots these stickers are
supposed to be up here give me a moment
and we're ready to have a look at the
rear i/o so we've got a multitude of
display outputs including mini
DisplayPort full-size DisplayPort and
HDMI so we've moved away completely from
DVI and VGA and remember guys what's
cool about Haswell chips is they do
support multi display outputs meaning
that from a Productivity standpoint so
sure you're not gonna be gaming on a
surround setup but from a Productivity
standpoint that's really really cool
we've got 6 USB 3.0 ports with full
support on the as media controller for
you asp which does improve USB 3
performance with supported devices we've
got an optical audio out a a USB BIOS
flash back button and I have used this
and it does work if you brick your board
you can use this to reset it as long as
you follow the instructions that you
find online we've got 4 USB 2.0 ports
and I think the point of this was to say
hey plug your keyboard and mouse in here
because some USB 3 ports still have some
compatibility weirdness with some
keyboards and mice there's nothing a
soos can do about it it's not really
their fault I think it's gonna be a long
time before we see any motherboards with
no USB 2 or at least it'll be a long
time before we should we've got an Intel
gigabit network controller as well as a
different one use this one because it
supports a Seuss's eye control software
which allows you to set network
prioritization and cool stuff like that
with an AI suite and last but not least
we've got 7.1 Audio out now a lot of the
improvements that isus has made go
beyond the hardware such as in the UEFI
bios and i call it a ua 5 io size even
though I know it's not correct it's
called the UEFI so they've got a bunch
of really cool stuff including ways that
you can segment away sort of your most
frequently used settings they've got the
simple mode much expanded so it includes
some of the more frequently used things
where people were just not even
bothering to use it because it didn't
allow you to do the things you needed to
do they've got full control of every fan
in the system now which is very very
cool and they actually ran a demo for us
showing how quickly the system can
actually set itself up to do things like
figure out the RPMs of all your fans
figure out the cooling that it all needs
and it'll just self optimize itself
which is very very neat you can also
make notes within the BIOS which is cool
now I've always liked features like BIOS
profiles
because they allow you to kind of you
know say oh well this is my aggressive
overclock this is my safe one that I
know works if that one bugs out or
whatever else but you could never really
label them all I could do was put like 4
gigahertz stable and that was all I
could really do now you can make notes
within the BIOS and it even keeps a log
of the last thing you change so when
you're tweaking and overclocking you can
be like oh well it was working before
and now it's not what did I actually
change and you can go back and fix it
quite easily the main information is
pinned to the bottom and from the demos
that I've seen I haven't actually fired
one of these up for myself yet it looks
much more efficient to navigate which is
really saying something because it was
already quite strong thank you for
