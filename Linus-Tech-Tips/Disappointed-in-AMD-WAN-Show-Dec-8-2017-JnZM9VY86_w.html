we um are late and for that we are sorry
only by 19 minutes need 981 at 9:00
depending on how you count it we don't
technically have a new start time five
o'clock but I don't know if we ever
officially announced that Colton changed
it because we were never on time anyway
the point is this time we were learning
while I was learning Luke was showing me
a different streaming software yeah so
this would be the first win show
streamed on OBS yeah not necessarily
because we think OBS is unequivocably
better than xsplit no which it isn't
but because xsplit has had an utterly
game-breaking bugs for us for the last
couple of weeks that has made it take
about half an hour at a forty-five
minutes of extra time after the show to
D corrupt if I the corrupted video
output and then upload it to YouTube so
it's been kind of a pain in the arse
which has mostly resulted in us like
downloading the vaad off of twitch so
that we can mess with it which takes a
while because it's an hour plus long
stream sometimes twitch takes a while to
process that then you have to down which
all makes sense which sense and is fine
it's just a pain in the butt and we
don't want to do that anymore so yeah
the LAN show to be very clear there's
pros and cons with both on OBS what else
do we have this week oh yeah rate the
news so Nvidia announced the Titan V and
you can have one for the value price of
only three thousand dollars we'll talk
about what exactly you get for your
money AMD and Qualcomm join forces for
always connected pcs else we got nice
hash was breached 64 million dollars of
Bitcoin was stolen that valuation is
going to constantly change so
about 4,700 coins and this is in
rapid-fire Ashley but damn
AMD silently lowers Radeon rx 560 specs
wah-wah
start with the interesting news and with
the super bad news
alright hold on I'm updating I'm
updating that nice hash number was 4700
coins stolen right so that is now
seventy six point six million because
Bitcoin has been like whoa lately it
does that alright let's roll that intro
ready
that work
like I knew it
like that you like yeah you let you like
those indicators maybe show me your
indicators I almost made a very specific
way too far joke but no it's good let's
move on Titan V oh yeah let's talk about
the Titan V V as compare we just you
know what I've got a given video a lot
of credit here for doing the right thing
with this graphics card now this was
supposed to buy max okay this is posted
by max settings on the forum and hold on
a second and the original article here
is from a non tech I think it's kind of
neat that max settings shared a post
about $3,000 graphics card so Nvidia did
the right thing here rather than confuse
consumers by calling their product
iPhone X but then 10 Nvidia called it
Titan V instead of like Titan 5 which
incidentally would it isn't the fifth
Titan hold on a second now you got the
Titan you got the Titan black it's gonna
depend you've got the Titan X you've got
the Titan XP and the XP PC and the X P P
so no technically it is the six Titan
now if they hadn't screwed up and had
both a Titan XP which was you know what
if you count what it actually says on
the shroud yeah there you yes cuz the
Titan didn't have the black filled in on
the Titan word the Titan black did but
it was the same same silver shroud then
weight the Titan you know hey which one
had the actual black shroud hold on we
might be missing one here kepler maxwell
pass gal Titan Titan yeah what was a
Titan loves a Titan black boy which one
actually got ya able to see a picture
though which one actually got like a
black shroud no so it was after it was
the Titan X that got a black shroud yes
okay okay cool so if we
nor the one that didn't get a pee on the
end of it the Titan acts Pascal which I
basically did ignore so I think I could
I can stick with that did we make a
video for that or do we just rant about
our way I don't think we did yeah I
don't think so if we agree that only
graphics cards that we do a review video
of count then this is the fifth Titan
okay okay that only we do it the ordered
one what a way to yeah I heard yeah
Wow I so I reached out to Nvidia yo are
you guys providing review samples of
this thing and they said I'm not
surprised at all I'm not even remotely
they said literally nothing that's the
joke um and so I'm kind of sitting here
going well okay I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna wait around and find out what
Titan Z I don't count the Titans either
we didn't review it okay this is very
convenient definition where if I don't
decide that something counts it doesn't
count
this is a fun way to live the world live
the world also it's live my life it also
wasn't a different GPU perceive the
world interpret the world
yeah that's true is it was two GPUs yeah
there see it mind you Titan black isn't
the difference and it's not even that
much blacker it's just black text oh
yeah
minor details um okay so right what do
we have to say about the Titan V last
night I love that the place they
announced it was the NIP sconce
conference because you know this is a
pretty hot announcement you know anyway
so they announced the Titan vide has a
golden shroud now which is just Oh
beautiful perfect why pick another color
thank you
you know it was like a few generations
ago that I su stood their golden stuff
so you can take a few generations old
bored pair it with your new $3,000
graphics card that was like 67 no it's
been more reason than that no no no a
soos hold on a second a soos gold board
we're making fun of this stuff on the
couch at the old house you're drunk
no no you're drunk yeah but they were
old boards by then okay hold on here
here's one of their stupid gold boards
was it okay z87 all right all right all
right okay z87 still that's how old is
that no it's perfect $3,000 grafts card
that board boom put it together best
combination I mean what is it is this
like isn't everything kind of going gold
these days like is this just because of
the iPhone do I have Apple to blame for
this a graphic let everybody else the
entire rest of the computer industry is
like okay fine we give up
everything's gonna be grayscale so black
gray or white yeah and we'll put RGB
lighting on so everything matches
everything else maybe that's why
actually because a very minor amount
I don't like gold but a very adamantly
gold jewelry I don't like whatever but a
very minor amount of gold accent on
something that's like blacked out looks
pretty sharp a ginormous graphics card
though is not like a small gold actually
go with the monochrome computer which is
like popular these days and then have
your black and gold Titan yeah what are
we actually going to see is there a
picture of the backplate ah no because
you only really see this side in the
backplate unless you're going with like
one of those vertical mount systems
which was like I'm gonna assume that is
black I'm gonna assume it's black this
thing looks so I'm probably gonna be
just a minor amount of accenting of gold
on the side that you're actually having
I'm gonna have to redo my how to paint
your graphics card tutorial with the new
Titan shroud because I can't imagine
anyone you should be with it like real
silver paint nothing I'm sure that's the
thing
sounds like poisonous or something I
don't know probably it's alright so
anyway what else can we say about this
thing or paint available for purchase
today three grand so that's almost four
thousand Canadian rupees which sucks but
like realistically
soin videos policy on cards that are not
intended for gamers is that they don't
generally seed them to gaming press but
gaming press wants to know how this
thing performs for games and gamers want
to know how this thing performs in games
so the way that we see it we're kind of
taking one for the team here we
absolutely have to get one and run some
games on it and see how it goes from
there cuz the specs on this thing are
ridiculous this is the same GPU as the
Tesla V 100 which is apparently a
$10,000 graphics so really we should all
stop complaining because you're giving a
$7,000 discount beautiful no no no no
complaints here give me four this is
targeted at machine learning scientists
who want to simply install the card in
their desktop PCs and not rely on a
special server or storage or networking
so it keeps the Titan branding as
opposed to geforce titan and it'll have
massive memory bandwidth yes it's using
HP m2 memory 12 gigs freakin gigs of it
and it has whistles HBM 2 to be clear a
hundred and ten it says dl in here but
I'm sure that means dual precision
teraflops so that's 9 times Oh deep
learning teraflops sorry
that's 9 times the deep learning
computing horse power of its predecessor
1450 5 megahertz boost clock this is a
massive 815 millimeter squared I believe
this was the largest of all time like
single monolithic die I don't remember
if it actually was but it is it is very
close a tsm's
did I already say 5120 CUDA cores holy
crap so one side for Titan vs Li for
compensator ah no no so that's really
interesting
guess Lionel um so so this is so the
previous Titan XP was 38 40 CUDA course
so this is a new architecture this is
Volta and it has many many more CUDA
cores and it has envy link connectors at
the top but this was actually a
developing story right as we were
starting the LAN show there's a thread
over on the Linus tech tips forum where
people are talking about this apparently
NVIDIA has come out and said it not only
does not support us Ally because it
doesn't have SLI fingers yeah it does
not support Indy link so the fingers are
there but Envy link is I guess
considered to be a data center feature
and not something that you would need in
a single system so Nvidia is coming
right out and making dual card
configurations for gaming and then also
for to be clear it doesn't matter how
they market this people are going to use
it for gaming yeah
so now dual card configurations will
still work for some workloads like
something like SolidWorks doesn't
require an v link or an SLI connector
you can just have more GPUs in and it'll
just you use more compute but where the
cards need to communicate with each
other
not having NV link will be a
disadvantage and for gaming they're just
like nope
you know last generation on generations
ago we took away three-way and four-way
on this stuff now we're taking away
two-way this is just one card persistent
boob done ha vapor chamber cooler 16
power phases 250 watt TDP and Wow
it gets the GV 100's full unrestricted
FP 64 compute and tensor core
performance and the only real thing that
differentiates it from Tesla is memory
capacity memory bandwidth and the lack
of nd link functionality it uses the
standard geforce driver stack freaking
cool
huh okay well I'm excited to see how
this goes interviewer writes there is no
gaming information at all yeah we're on
the Titan V page this is not like what
in videos done in the past year they've
gone like Titan Titan Z was a perfect
example of this where they're like this
thing is was it that one three grand - I
think so
Titan Z was really like this thing is
thousands of dollars because it's a
professional product not for gamers and
they need to go on legree grand yeah
retailer websites you go on NCIX or
Newegg or whatever and there'd be banner
ads using like nvidia assets that are
like titan z the ultimate gaming
performance yes like okay is it or is it
not well this one there is absolutely
nothing in there that's cool because
it's cool because if they want this to
be the non gaming thing that they keep
on saying that they are original Titan
was supposed to be yeah so this is just
kind of coming back to its roots a
little bit yeah cuz it's strayed pretty
hard um all right AMD and Qualcomm this
was posted on the forum by username the
linus portal i don't know what a linus
portal is i'm gonna try not to be
weirded out by it
I'm sure it's I'm sure it might not be
your portal yeah yeah different would be
a different linus like it's confusing
anyway the original post here was from
Engadget Boop aimed um Qualcomm join
forces to power higher end connected pcs
so they're going up against Intel's
isom compatible systems so in a nutshell
they're teaming up to make all these
connected pcs on AMD's rise in mobile
platform using Snapdragon LTE modems to
enable gigabit connection speeds okay so
apparently the pair of the processor and
this like always connected chip will
make it so that you can play something
like League of Legends anywhere without
Wi-Fi yeah
okay I mean this is actually something
we're talking about like just last week
on the way show yeah yeah I mean more
connectivity for these devices that now
I mean a device like the LG Graham the
last generation one not the one with the
8th gen processor that one's battery
life is not as much but something like a
last gen LG Graham is getting 9 plus
hours in like a battery life test and in
real usage can get well over that like
sometimes 10 even 12 hours so having a
device like that just be able to be
connected literally all the time is
obviously desirable so and you could
theoretically have a laptop that was
more performance
it wasn't the performance of the laptop
that was hampering the game you could
play it's just this chip in particular
that we're talking about so you could
get a higher-end laptop that also has
this Snapdragon x16 LTE modem and would
be able to game other things just on
that powerful system probably gonna be
plugged in so we have our first all AMD
laptop like not of all time like I'd
probably at some point like eight years
ago of moderner like - tech tips covered
one like I don't remember it there's a
long time ago
Asus sent us over a gaming laptop that's
got pull air a Polaris GPU and a rise in
CPU so we're gonna be checking that out
pretty soon cool AMD is finally relevant
in laptops again or maybe they're not I
don't know we haven't tested it yet but
they're are they got design wins and
that's a lot more than they could say
over the last couple of years
oh boy so I lost about three hundred
dollars okay okay I'll say that the
original article here is from Reuters
which I will confess I did not know how
this was pronounced until like less than
a year ago I thought it was like Reuters
goods yeah and like whenever I heard
people say Reuters like just kind of you
know on the periphery I thought they
were talking about like steroids close
attention that's funny I don't think
I've ever attempted to pronounce it like
with no pre-knowledge yeah I heard the
name before I read the name yeah well
you know what I've had enough of your
I've had enough of your comments twitch
chat which I don't even have to look at
the twitch chat to know that I'm gay
like skinned alive over there yeah so
nice hash which this puts me in a bit of
an awkward position because we didn't go
as far as to recommend it Oh in our
recent video part 1 of our Bitcoin /
cryptocurrency mining exploration but we
did show it we did talk about what the
service does and it was cool and we were
using it yeah which means that when they
got hacked earlier this week we lost
about 300 bucks but I'm not gonna
complain because the total amount of
money lost is tens of millions of
dollars
the headline is 64 million because
that's based on what the value was right
around the time that this news broke but
it went up last night was huge I believe
was the last night or the night before
um it was yesterday morning or like
yesterday yesterday your early morning I
think it spiked up to like 1800 or
something like that it was crazy
do you mean early morning isn't like
2:00 in the morning um well I don't know
I was at a shoot and it was like 11 a.m.
my time 10:00 a.m. my time okay so it
was like whenever it was a very recent
that it spiked up and the value of this
down yeah and even now it's like Tamale
and more ya bout than it was when it
first happened so this isn't the first
time this has happened there's been so
in this one put in particular there's
about 4,700 coins stolen bitcoins stolen
in in all there's been nine hundred and
eighty thousand bitcoins that have been
stolen from exchanges alone that total
is worth more than fifteen billion
dollars at current exchange rates and
that is when they calculated it before
so it's actually worth more now so
here's the thing that we should probably
do because there's over eight so there's
been at least three dozen of these
thefts on digital currency exchanges
since 2011 including the one that led to
the collapse of Mount GOx which was the
largest Bitcoin exchange at the
time so what I'm kind of thinking is
everyone who wants to get into Bitcoin
seems to figure out how to buy it or how
to mine it and then I feel like it's
really easy to get lazy about the other
stuff you want to get into like cold
storage how to store it how to dump it
because the literally the only way to be
100% certain that your Bitcoin will not
be vulnerable to a hack is to store it
completely offline whether that's a
hardware wallet
yeah or whether that's a cold computer
but by that I mean like a computer
that's not on a network yeah so some
people will even go as far as to store
handwritten notes in safety deposit
boxes in traditional banks and I think
that's really something that is worth
discussing because a lot of people are
going into this whole bitcoin slash
altcoin cryptocurrency thing thinking
that once they Google a little bit and
they find you know who the reputable
exchanges are or the reputable wallets
are once they find that they've got the
equivalent of a banks type of security
and to be clear if banks are not perfect
either by the way but in traditional
finance usually if a bank gets heisted
depends depends how much money is in the
account for example yeah I don't know
all the details I just know I've had
forever ago my like debit card got
ripped off yeah and a few thousand
dollars where the transactions went
through it and I got my money back
pretty quick so that is heavily
dependent on your account you're a
financial institution you use a credit
union which back then may have actually
been an advantage but maybe no longer is
oh we could talk about it more offline
anyway the point is people Google around
they find something that looks for
putable yeah you know everyone on reddit
up voted or whatever else and then they
kind of go okay yeah my money is safe
there but in truth there is so much more
to it and like as much fun as it is to
buy some Bitcoin at 70 70 150 is I think
what I got in at a little while ago and
I
I had I had abstained for the longest
time and finally I was like you know
what forget it I'm just gonna I'm gonna
buy some as much as much fun as it is to
look at that and go whoo I doubled my
money over the last three weeks which I
did and I'm feeling pretty good about it
unless you actually know how to get it
out and convert it into a fiat currency
right now with the volatility of Bitcoin
and for that matter real currency in
general people gonna be pissed that
we're saying this but like even just
looking at charts and stuff it is so
it's not even just necessarily fall a
tile because volatile means that it dies
right
no it means it varies okay yeah so it is
extremely freaking valen it's extremely
volatile and to me currency is not
currency unless it can be exchanged for
goods and services and right now you
cannot buy a car with bitcoins at the
local dealer that's right yeah there's
gonna be like some person yeah some
dealerships somewhere I don't care that
is not the point the point is that if
you wanted it let's say let's say I
bought $1,000 of Bitcoin and it went up
10x and all of a sudden I had $10,000 I
wanted to go to like Joe's used auto
auto lot or whatever and I was like yo I
invested $1,000 in Bitcoin I'm gonna buy
a car I cannot do that unless I cash out
today so that's what I mean when I say
as much fun as it is to have this money
until you can actually exchange it for
goods and services
it's just paper and I kind of slurred my
words there which was funny because I
kind of said surfaces you could buy
surfaces if you whatever you're into
cars surfaces razor blades I don't care
so I mean is that something that we
should be starting to maybe do like a
maybe make part of that multi-part
Bitcoin series I think so looking into
videos online about this kind of yeah
one of the least documented processes is
wallets and storage of your coins and
one of the most important parts about it
is wallets and storage of your coins and
when this nice hash thing
and people weren't saying cuz you're
talking about the Bitcoin community
right so people weren't coming at it
from the angle you were yeah it is like
you need to bring it into fiat
currencies people were going at it from
the angle if you need to secure your
Bitcoin people don't understand okay
loll I'm a duckie is paypal currency
then or not yes because it's in a real
currency it's just stored with PayPal
Bitcoin is a real currency and by real I
mean fiat currency I mean a recognized
currency so yeah to be clear on the
volatile thing I looked it up it does
have a negative connotation sure it can
have whatever connotation it wants but
that doesn't change that it's a very
volatile but it is but it's going up so
volatiles like apparently not entirely
both how specifically a negative thing
okay so Radek in a bad way which it is
it can it has mostly been erratic in a
good way yes when it's not except when
it's not which does happen and you might
get screwed on a trade because I'm like
oh ho but like so far holding has been a
very good strategy like someone bought
real estate with it recently right we
actually specifically said that yes
someone somewhere is taking it but
there's coffee shops that take it
there's there are sites that take it
we're looking into trying to take it for
floatplane subscriptions it's a thing
there's there's certain areas there's a
cruise that you go on that you can go on
that you pay for with Bitcoin and I
think all the transactions while you're
on the cruise are done in Bitcoin
there's some stuff but it would be it's
not it's not the norm is what we're
trying to say yeah so essentially taking
it out of Bitcoin putting into USD is a
generally safer way to deal with it but
your USD you can still get stolen
everything can still get stolen that's
kind of an important thing to understand
but stuff like cold wallets holding your
storage and offline computers the effort
types of wallets using Hardware while
it's all this kind of stuff isn't as
well-documented as most other things in
the Bitcoin world and when something
like this nice hash thing happens all
the smug commenters are going you will
you can't have it
in a hardware wallet or an offline
wallet like
most people responding or like what is
that how do you do that yeah and there
there there is some resources on it but
not a ton yeah yeah well let's uh we'll
have a look at that we'll figure out a
plan I think part two is gonna be the
more optimized mining machine okay so
that's mostly done we actually would
have had the motherboard today but it
got sent to North Carolina for some
reason yeah long story okay
um or Connecticut I don't know it was a
us something and it had a C in it so
okay it was a city or a state and it had
a C at the beginning was in California I
know that much
anyway so so we would have had a ceases
nineteen GPU board even though we're not
actually gonna be using all nineteen
slots so the reason for that get this is
in order to run ninety why well Bitcoin
what do you think
no I but but even for Bitcoin why would
you get that board because then you
don't have to have more boards and more
RAM sticks and more CPUs how expensive
is that board two hundred bucks hmm yeah
yeah so you save you because I mean that
the cheapest the cheapest CPU is like
forty bucks from Intel anyway but are
you putting them all next to each other
no the way that it works is you use use
extenders yeah yeah so the slots are
it's it's like this thing's hilarious
I'll bring it up I haven't the b250
mining expert it's literally cut okay I
thought you were just buying some like
crazy server board not like dude this is
like this is all wall yeah look at this
thing is ridiculous there's all the
slots it's like that's amazing so anyway
the funny thing about it is that in
order to actually use all nineteen six
of them have to be Nvidia sgp 1:06 based
mining specific card okay exactly six I
think like the manual for this thing is
HIGHlarious because check out these oh
so these power like different slots and
there's like a whole diagram and stuff
and then there's like this diagram for
like what types of cards you can install
in what ratios in what slots in order to
actually populate all 19 of them so
these guys have to come up the same
power supply as this one in case you
were wondering and don't quote me on
that I looked at the manual a couple
hours ago actually there's two - RAM
slots - RAM slots I'm even surprised
there's four SATA ports ah yeah yeah
what would you need that for it I would
have expected he's got a USB 3 header -
or one yeah yeah so so yeah so that's
gonna be part 2 part 3 we're gonna take
a look at a sick miners and then maybe
part four will start to get into storage
how to sell maybe like a part 5 it would
be cool to take a look at some of the
tools that people are using like crack
into not just like Google not not just
like googling what's the USD to Bitcoin
conversion but like cracking has been
terrible but yeah okay but some of
there's a lot of different tools that PD
are using taking a look at a handful of
them and kind of going okay well here's
some of the advantages and drawbacks of
each of them yeah yeah I mean I think I
think it would be something that would
be very beneficial to the community at
large
like Krakens charts are super nice and
really rapidly updated yeah but which is
well half the time the site doesn't work
well that's a problem which is you know
a pro and con yes yeah speaking of
conversations we want to have let's talk
about I think no thing yeah so you don't
drag stuff I know I realize that okay so
I want to talk about that we actually
thought for the longest time that don't
know that well we thought and we might
still think we might not be sure what we
think okay but we thought that you
weren't allowed to show man nips on
Twitter are we doing it so I'm gonna
find out once and for all hold on I'm
gonna find out cuz we actually like
fairly regularly have twitch staff
watching our stream so we're we're doing
our Mac Weldon's one today no no no we
are going now normally Luke jumps in
with the hands and covers the nips
yeah and to be clear I'm not gonna do
anything sexual because that's clearly
in their terms of certain which I have
wondered about K cuz if there's a girl
on stream yeah and some dude puts his
hands in front and it doesn't show her
nips I bet you that would still be
banner bull even though that's exactly
what we did just with - what if he
hasn't like an 8 inch or like a 12 inch
buffer cuz that's often what I yeah like
yeah like a 12 inch buffer like
this yeah could be sexual yeah but maybe
this isn't you know maybe okay so here
it goes are we gonna get banned sorry
apologies headphone users because that
was probably terrible I didn't see any
staff in check oh oh what's going on now
oh I thought I thought the page actually
like disappeared I was like whoa that's
free we wrote the twitch Internet
okay so Mac Weldon makers are the shirts
that we're wearing believes in smart
design premium fabrics and simple
shopping Mac Weldon makes super
comfortable clothes whether it's
underwear socks shirts under shirts
hoodies or sweatpants and this is
awesome they have a line of silver
underwear and shirts that are naturally
antimicrobial which I'm very comfortable
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get judgy
okay you know I'm not saying anything
about you know our audience and you know
or like twitch in general and what are
the odds that you might benefit from an
antimicrobial shirt see we're not going
there but antimicrobial means that it'll
help eliminate odor and if you've ever
been to a land party I'm not gonna
generalize but I will say that there are
certain people you'll find someone at
any land party who should probably be
wearing an NG microbial shirt it's got a
little bit over that's what I'll say
yeah that's what I'll say so they want
you to be comfortable and not smell and
if you don't like your first pair you
can keep them and they will still refund
you no questions asked so go check them
out at Mac welcome calm and get 20% off
your Mac Wheldon purchases at Jeannie
dot us slash small D small V big G big Y
big I or small L I don't know which it
is so I'm gonna paste it in the twitch
chat slash it'll be under the video
and you guys can click it because that's
a better way to handle that right now is
fantastic oh are they are they are they
upset about me oh no they're just
they're just making jokes about it Oh
excellent good I'm never sure if I'm
gonna make people mad when I'm like what
cuz here's the thing is like the culture
today is one of not being able to say
things that are true sometimes and like
I'd like to think that most gamers like
back when I was going to Land's and
you're there for like sometimes 48 hours
at a time nobody leaves so you clearly
haven't showered in two days and we've
been sitting at your computer and here's
the thing when you're gaming when
competitively gaming the odds of you
sweating in a stinky way are actually
higher than if you were working out
because stress sweat stinks more than
exercise sweat so you're sitting there
gaming you're like stressed out for two
days you're probably gonna smell and I
mean I'm not some people forget there ll
say forget some people are bound to
forget their deodorant that they
definitely do own so but you never know
like sometimes Mambo people are gonna
get upset about these things and it's
just like you know you never know what
you can what you can actually say okay I
mean this for a quick second alright
this is where I don't know because we
are in a little bit of like outrage II
kind of culture yeah yeah sure but then
we're also getting older yeah so is this
like the old people say offensive things
kind of situation like are we becoming
the racist grandpa exactly except about
like people who smell yeah like totally
different category of stuff yeah but is
that bar lighten up are people who smell
becoming a subculture that you can't
discriminate against TV because here's
the thing all sniffs are equal I'm not
gonna name any names but we had a
situation at Lynas media group where I
had to speak to an employee about his or
her hygiene
and I'm really not gonna name any names
I'm not gonna give any hints as me no
wasn't it oh I thought it was me
oh no that was pajamas yeah it was a
separate issue that was professionalism
/ I've probably given you crap about
being sweaty at some time or another but
yeah but no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
say who it was no I don't even know who
this is okay no because that's because
it's private well you did a good job
yeah thank you um so I actually did have
to speak to an employee about hygiene at
one point and I really wasn't sure how
to do it because is that discriminatory
it's a difficult yeah because it's a
difficult thing work they weren't
showing up like in an in an indecent
garb like they weren't showing up in an
in a thong and no pants like something
that's like clearly you know sexually
inappropriate how's that yeah and and so
I can I can tell you my solution in a
way that will make it very difficult for
you to track down who it would have been
okay but at some point in our process of
doing annual reviews I added a field
about professionalism and about
maintaining appropriate personal hygiene
for the sake of the comfort in the
workplace of your colleagues because I
dunno about that field because I've been
in there because I wore pajamas to work
that was the professionalism oh yeah
yeah yeah and so out of the way yes
shorts yeah the short side I've never
cared about the shorts have never
bothered me it was it was when you would
literally like roll out of bed go to
work and be like wearing a shirt that's
like stained and like pj pants that are
ripped to hell like to the point where
yeah to the point where it was a little
indecent yeah every single pair of
pajamas that I have as a hole in the
crotch so anyone why new pajamas so so
these are things that I've actually had
to worry about like am I being the the
the
the the anti deodorant issed you know
grandpa yeah it's like you shouldn't
smell bad
who knows that's it like I'm running
into these situations that is a cultural
thing like there's people who are anti
anything that's unnatural shaving
deodorant that kind of thing and you
know maybe I'm crossing a you know a
personal boundary by being like yo you
smell in a manner that is my discomfort
level is about here right now you know
yeah I have no I have no idea so there
you go anyways next sponsor they're like
no this is irrelevant old people don't
care about bad smell which is you know
what no I'm not gonna get into it
because maybe some of the best like
groomed people that I know and I think
it gets to a certain point where it
becomes it becomes it's not that they
don't care I think well okay some of
them probably don't care like some
people okay so there's two things
there's actually a number of factors
here I think some people get old and
give zero FS about anything yeah and
they're just like Yolo also I'm close to
the end of it so I'm just not gonna
stress about this stuff other people get
to the point where they can't really
care for themselves properly and like
that makes them unhappy actually or it
would be extremely tedious to do so so
Steve Jobs apparently didn't shower I do
know that that is a thing
like not showering and letting your
body's natural flora like take care of
itself is apparently theoretically a
thing
I haven't actually like smelled someone
when you do about grime in that case I
don't know like what if you get dirty
like a file you know that's my finger I
smell like I know how this works
not that kind I guess he smell fine he's
no neutral no I didn't actually notice
any smell different if I can walk into
the room and nobody notices I consider
that optimal yeah okay okay sorry let's
just jump into our next thing
savage jerky I'm going for delicious
turkey the sirs
yeah it's already I'm going for a mohawk
that is so nice you had the Moho ready
for me good out of the box yeah so
savage jerky was created with the intent
of making a delicious snack that is also
not bad for you so it's made without
nitrates or preservatives and they've
got 15 that's 15 13 different flavors of
jerky some of our favorites are the Moho
and the the maple the maple bacon I love
the maple bacon also the traditional is
really really good and then if you're
the kind of person who's into the melt
your face off jerky I'm like salivating
just looking at this it happens every
week for me then they've got Carolina
Reaper like ghost pepper jerky and then
because they're experts in making your
face melt off with peppers they've also
got hot sauces and barbecue sauces and a
spice rub if you're pretty into spice
but don't want to face melt I would
recommend moho habanero that's a good
one
so use all four code LTT to save 10%

corporate shoppers on that list or
something I am going to talk really fast
I am going to confess that I had never
heard of this before before this moment
right now I have okay cool yeah I'm
gonna go get it because I only have one
browser extension installed right now so
I don't have like a super loaded up
browser yeah
yeah so that seems like a pretty good
one I have for I think not a crazy man
all right got a couple more topics here
there's a leaked Intel sorry for point
at some point yes there is a leaked
Intel roadmap that's on wucf tech so we
take it with a grain of salt this was
posted on the forum by none lock 21 and
apparently until cascade Lake X is
confirmed for a TD T it'll be arriving
on X 299 /lg a 20 66 in late 28 team so
none of this is surprising at all
because that's what Intel does every
generation they want you chipset with
CPUs then they do a CPU refresh then you
get a new chipset then you get nuts okay
um
also this is groundbreaking news coffee
like X s s not X will apparently get
dual-core processors and there'll be
more processor updates in 2018 along
with Z 390 and B 360 chipsets
blah blah blah blah blah blah no mention
of eight core processors so those have
been rumored and Gemini Lake goes in n
series processors features ten watt TDP
and four slash two core variants so
these are 14 nanometer gold montt cores
and those are apparently coming in the
52nd week of 2018 so end of next year ok
neat now let's talk about stuff that's
coming a little bit sooner this display
post posted by aluminium tech on the
forum and the original article here is
from Qualcomm comm they've got a new CPU
cutting watt wall the 845 mobile
platform
um yeah your next phone your next phone
will have one of these unless you buy a
phone right now
yeah and then we're like Oh jeepers one
or an iPhone and it will be a little bit
better um how much better you say 25 to
35 percent faster than current
Snapdragon 835 it can apparently record
480 FPS video at 720p or 240 FPS at 1080
that's pretty cool mind you like most
phones absolutely kill their image
quality yeah when you're recording at
high frame rates so even though it is
1920 pixels by 1080 pixels it looks
blocky and like trash yeah so yeah
although the 25 to 30% faster thing is
gonna be interesting
to check out yeah this is the first
qualcomm SOC to have a secure processing
unit so this is a new subsystem to
protect data like your fingerprints iris
mobile payments sim and more that's
interesting but it's probably like a
super cracked already why would it be if
it stores everything locally yeah but
there's get their name right now
American government thing oh I have to
FCC in my head that's obviously not it
yeah and I say NSA has NSA tools or
whatever
those of leaked repeatedly and
considering how delayed this is compared
to apples I wouldn't be surprised if it
was like developed in cohorts with them
I know it's like tinfoil Hattie but
these things keep coming true so I don't
know
and those NSA tools keep leaking so like
random pirate groups keep getting access
to them and that it's super not secure
so I don't know I wouldn't absolutely
trust it but hey cool uh in other news
this was originally posted on a non tech
comm AMD has apparently silently lowered
the spec of their rx 560 yeah to
basically a previous generation spec
update an AMD statement given to our
sister site Tom's Hardware confirms the
two rx 560 variants and AMD also noted
that AIB partners so like sapphire Emma
sighs whose etc would be responsible for
communicating a given rx 560 models
specifications Wow so you can either get
14 compute units or 16 compute units
buying an Rx 560 this is trash and AMD
should feel terrible and they should not
do this so with an Rx 560 let's go with
the 14 compute unit model you can get 14
C use and 896 espies now comparing to an
Rx 460 which has 14 C use and 896 SPS
what are the big reasons why people are
pissed off is because it's essentially a
460 like if you want to sell slightly
disabled 5 6 with less room why don't
you just sell for 60s how complicated is
that yeah Wow it's Polaris 11
like honestly it's the last time that
like this is not the first time for AMD
I don't know if you know this but I
still remember one of the most pissed
off that I have ever been about a
technology purchase was when I bought a
Sapphire Radeon 9600 non-pro and this
was back like almost 15 years ago like
back when that was a somewhat
respectable card but nearing the end of
its lifecycle so it was like a it was
like a value gaming card so I already
had my own gaming rig but I was
upgrading my parents computer so that my
siblings could play like Sims or
whatever and what happened was sapphire
called the card Radeon I ended up on the
phone for literally hours with both
sapphire and AMD support over this when
I found out that this 9600 and in this
case it was not marked in any way on the
box that this 9600 was different from a
normal 9600 when this 9600 had I forget
what the difference was I think it had a
narrower memory bus or something like
that like it had a like a 64 versus a
128-bit bus or something along those
lines and there were no specs on line
other than the specific product page for
this sapphire card which was like hard
to find on their site that made it clear
that it was not a normal 9600 I thought
we were past this I don't really get why
tech companies feel the need to rebadge
especially in this manner when they
already had a product that they could
have just sold as this now there are
some differences the new one compared to
the 460 can go down to a lower TDP so as
low as 60 watts versus approximately 75
watts and it's available with just two
gigs of ram instead of just being a four
gig part but I feel like it would have
been a lot less misleading to just call
this a two gig 460 and just make it
available
especially because like in their update
statement to be clear they said we're
working with all we're taking immediate
steps to remedy to this we're working
with all Adam board and channel partners
to make sure product descriptions and
names clarify the Cu count so the gamers
consumers know exactly what they're
buying that's not going to work we
apologize for the confusion this may
have caused that was intentional that's
BS the reason why it's not gonna work is
the vast majority of consumers don't
know what a freaking Cu is yeah of
course not we're looking at a model
number our model names all they had to
do and they've even done stuff like this
in the past all they had to do if they
were gonna do a cut-down one is call it
le or Excel or something along those
lines like there's plenty of precedent
that already exists for how to do this
properly and they just decided not to
this is really bad for AMD because AMD
was very much in the for the people yeah
they're supposed to be like you know the
good guy underdog like that's their
brand image that ain't reject the last
like major controversy that I know of on
what this scale should be but this
doesn't seem to be blowing up as much
probably because not an insane amount of
people are buying 5 60s and a lot more
people had purchased nine 70s was the
RAM issue on nine seventies that was the
last big time that it was like this is
essentially being lied about yeah
all right I'm good man sneekybeeky stuff
not cool what else we got here okay um
oh yeah sure why not
Oh steam no longer accepts Bitcoin oh I
actually didn't even know that they
accepted Bitcoin as payment didn't he
the original poster here was vegetable
stew we'll go ahead and pull up okay so
first of all anyone who was giving me
crap about using the word volatile to
describe Bitcoin you can go ahead and
give valve a bunch of crap for it too
because there's all the instances of
volatile or volatility in the first
three paragraphs of their statement on
why they are no longer I don't think
it's completely invalid to use it's just
gonna trigger some people yeah so yeah
there you go so go ahead and get
triggered by valve two I actually yeah I
had no idea that they didn't accept it
so when they first added Bitcoin as a
method of payment transaction fees were
as low as 20 cents
now they've crept up as high as $20 per
transaction these fees are passed on to
the consumer and they result in
unreasonably high cost for games also
the value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed
for a certain period of time so if the
transaction doesn't complete within that
window the amount of Bitcoin needed to
cover the transaction can change well
the normal solution is either to refund
the original payment or the user or ask
the user to transfer additional funds
but both in both of these cases the
users hit with the transaction fee again
not to mention that this is like a
customer service overhead nightmare for
any retailer or a tailor they've said
they'll reevaluate it at a later date
and I don't blame them at all with all
of that said are we planning to support
Bitcoin on floatplane we want to and
what are the obstacles right now you can
if you can talk about it so okay the
main obstacles right now to be
completely honest is everything else
essentially is a higher priority the
site's not up payments for the current
payment system the forum is atrocious
and we need payments for credit card to
work and we need the new implementation
for payments for PayPal which will be
Braintree to work and I want essentially
I want the MVP of the site to be up I
want
able to be using the proper domain not
going through the forum I want all that
other kind of stuff done and then we'll
look into supporting Bitcoin but there
is going to be more issues once we start
doing that how do we deal with fraud
okay I literally don't know like on
Bitcoin you mean yeah right I have no
clue yeah that's fine like what if
there's fraudulent transactions there's
no I can't go contact someone's bank
contacting the it's their wallet like I
can't do anything like that
I'm not entirely sure how refunds work I
think we would be on the hook for the
transaction fee for refunds right we're
with most services you've got a refund
of the transaction fee yeah and if
that's if it's a $20 transaction for you
that could drive us under pretty fast if
yeah like there is a lot of potential
issues we're gonna look into it I
haven't looked into any of those issues
I don't know so yeah maybe I don't know
it's just not very high on the priority
tier we just need to know can I do this
no can I try I would really prefer not
then literally working on it right now
is it worth a shot come on let's try it
you only live once
whoa what's bad okay
I even want to put a giant disclaimer
here last time a whole bunch of people
signed up for floatplane on the forum
and paid for their access and then we're
very upset when they couldn't log in to
this site to access it yes just like
last time this is not the site that is
working right now at all to access
floatplane it's the front page of the
forum and then if you are subscribed it
is at the top of the forum there's a
floatplane section yeah I'm not logged
in yet right now that that's normally
how you access it yeah but you know I
mean hey come on you only live only live
once right baby
oh that's weird I don't I didn't did
whoo oh when did that happen can you use
your thing
no why I don't know can i that things
being used by swedish bros for
development oh okay so now what i can
make you one dang it
David you why are you what is this what
are you doing well I know he's your
counter usually do that and then just
cover it with the camera right no I
usually use the other one oh yeah okay
well do it do a news topic okay or we
can switch and I can set up a different
account that you can use no it's fine
just uh just do a news topic in the
meantime it's not in the doc but you
might even be able to talk about this
while you're covering that and Nick has
a link for me
apparently Apple is acquiring the music
recognition app Shazam interesting I
actually did already read about this
apparently it's some amount less than a
billion dollars so that's good if you're
Apple I guess cuz I don't know if I
would pay a billion dollars for Shazam
but I mean I don't know if this is
reactionary or if this is something that
they already had planned but this
definitely helps Apple address Google's
implementation on the pixel on the pixel
to rather anywhere where the device is
always listening to music around you as
creepy as that is and will just display
passively on the screen of your phone
what what song is playing so other than
helping Siri better recognize songs I
don't really know what the benefit of
this is for Apple but it goes to show
you that they are they are sure willing
to spend a lot of money to have it be
slightly easier to find out what song
and also I guess you could have just
used Shazam but not do that for a
billion dollars
that's less than a billion dollars yeah
so yeah
okay why are you why are you trying to
show that my blog wanna I wanted to I
wanted to try it I was gonna link it to
the other one and then I was gonna like
go through and I was gonna you know but
yeah there's nothing to use right now oh
good like the videos aren't there yet no
oh okay I thought they were no okay so
we're making that part just work for
live streaming oh no oh right
live-streaming is gonna be a thing soon
yeah yeah alright so right now on
floatplane we've got the porsche designs
making make sure that you're covering up
we've got the porsche design book 1c
look I'm driving a laptop oh I actually
didn't put that together right away oh
oh my goodness we've got our review of
the arrow 15 X this is a thin and light
with a gtx 1070 Wow it's pretty
impressive and they managed to do it
with the touchpad in not a stupid
location does it can we can we get a
little spoiler does it throttle um it's
really good okay yeah it's like really
impressive
we finally yeah pretty much every laptop
throttles under combined load though
yeah so we finally released a video on
Vega frontier edition the teaser for
this is amazing yeah this is this was a
freaking saga
Brandon's smartphone camera showdown
which we promised in the next week or
two after whatever video I was recording
when I was like yo Brandon why don't you
do your the smartphone camera showdown
is finally up on floatplane so he
compares the iPhone 8 plus with the no
date with the V 30 with the pixel to
excel so we don't have the iPhone 10 in
there but my understanding is a is that
it is a pretty similar camera to the
iPhone 8 plus so I'm not too worried
about it
we've got the eve V the crowd-sourced
surface competitor and then I don't
think this handy tech has made it onto
YouTube yet either handy tech old is new
again so we've actually got a lot of
stuff on there including a couple tech
quickies
there's overclocking void your warranty
for example so if you
cannot wait to find out then you can
sign up for floatplane where you'll get
one week ish of early access one week
ish it's ish don't worry about it
yeah all right honestly I don't know
what else we got
Oh Nintendo games are coming to the
