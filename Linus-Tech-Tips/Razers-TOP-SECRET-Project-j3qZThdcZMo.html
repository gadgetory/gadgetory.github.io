coverage this year check out their
awesome skins at the link below so I
like raiser and for the most part I like
what they do with their notebook line of
products the blade 14 is my current
daily driver late 2016 Edition 1060
whatever it is they're calling it these
days but I have to confess that I was
pretty taken aback when they showed me
this this is to be clear not a product
even though it kind of looks like a
product but razors good at that
showing up at these trade shows was
something that kind of like actually
from the outside come looks like oh yeah
I like that could kind of work except oh
wait the technology won't be there for I
don't know 10 years so yeah good for you
so what we're looking at right now is
called Project Valerie and you'd be
forgiven for thinking that it looks an
awful lot like a razor blade Pro you
know the one that I reviewed over here
and I liked some things like the fact
that it's slimmer than any other GT X
1080 equipped notebook but didn't like
other things like the mechanical
keyboard you'd be forgiven for thinking
gee it looks an awful lot like that but
with two extra screens glued to the side
but that's not what it is so it's
important to understand that while this
concept does bear a strong resemblance
to the blade pro it is in fact not what
Razer wants to know I guess is whether
there's someone out there anyone out
there are you out there
leave a comment who wants to roll up at
the Tim hijos or if you're American I
guess Dunkin Dunkin Donuts would be the
equivalent roll up at the Tim hijos and
effectively have your slash are slash
battle stations rig on the table in
front of you now my response to that
would be G razor
it's got competition at least in its
current form from a lot of places the
spud pop-up display those USB
external displays by the time something
like this were to make it to market even
lightweight VR headsets that are very
high-resolution so you could use a
virtual desktop or my personal favorite
for something that could be done in a
reasonable timeframe like a thunderbolt
add-on for the existing blade that would
clip on and just have one cable to power
a couple external displays you just kind
of fold it up put it in your bag
separately that way you don't have to
carry it around all the time but I think
these are the kinds of conversations
that they're trying to inspire with this
product not necessarily bring three by
4k eggs so surround gaming machine to
market though they were quick to point
out that they have a prototype that
works a little more than this one it
only slides like it's got a bit of a
different mechanism that was running
battlefield one at I would say thanks to
gsync somewhat acceptable frame rates so
I think what it comes down to is this I
have my skepticism I presented four
options at least two to three of which I
think might make more sense than this
one at least in his current form but I
want to hear from you guys in the
comments is Razer on the right track for
who who are you and why do you think
they're on the right track or you create
a professional are you a gamer or are
they completely off their gourd and this
will never fly let me know down below
thanks for checking out this video guys
don't miss any of our CES 2017 coverage
brought to you by the D brand I don't
have my razor blade on me which is sort
of embarrassing for two reasons I'm in
the razor suite and it has a D brand
skin on it and I'm talking about D brand
but but D Brad makes precision fitted
vinyl skins for your devices that make
them look sick AF and protects them from
incidental scratches and scrapes you can
check them out at the link in the video
description they do phones laptops
including blades they do game consoles
game controllers all kinds of good stuff
check it out below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
