today it's a p55 GD 65 motherboard from
MSI let's do a quick unboxing here and
show you all the cool accessories it
comes with mostly boring accessories we
got an i/o shield okay we have those
little things that help you plug in your
USB if you have a really old case we
have four SATA cables a couple SATA to
molex power adapters some ribbon cable
or two floppy and IDE I don't have a lot
of space on my SD card so we're gonna
have to go fast drivers and utilities
MSI extras I think it's like Norton and
something hard drive backup user guide
quick installation guide which looks
absolutely huge and complicated
we'll figure that out later SLI
crossfire bridges MSI winkie I don't
know what this is but yeah MSI winky p55
GB 65 user guide then we have a little
USB backplate thing okay so let's get
the environmentally friendly packaging
out of here and let's get this board up
cuz that's the that's the interesting
part so on the board we've got the OC
button which is like a one button
overclocking utility it's a pretty
nice-looking PCB OC Genie there that's
what it's called just a little button
right here and then you can change your
base clock with the plus and minus
buttons kind of cool for such an
inexpensive board you've got seven SATA
ports right here along with oh let's
show that back the back slot so this is
at 11:56 port so we've got ps2 digital
audio eight USB ports two Ethernet one
eSATA no no eSATA we have firewire okay
so there's no lis SATA that's okay
so it supports crossfire and SLI now
I've ripped the sticker so we have to do
it in one shot now and then you've got a
super pipe dr. Moss which is MSI is a
mosfet solution it uses two your phasers
phases but the switching frequency is
faster so they're saying it's quite a
bit better than what other people are
using and then here we have our 1156 pin
socket which I have never opened one
before but yeah okay that's not working
at all there we go
so that's socket 1156 now I'll get the
cameraman to have a look at it so there
you have it you've got dual channel
memory all the appropriate power adaptor
oh here's a cool feature you can read
your voltages using this little
interface right here very cool so this
is the Veatch
points awesome awesome feature so thank
you for checking out my blog on the msi
p55 GD 65 oh yeah and this is like the
coolest thing ever
Intel Core i7 lunch box we'll be giving
these away in some kind of promotion
over the next little bit but I thought
it was pretty neat and inside oh yeah
check it out
we got tea whatever chips for this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
