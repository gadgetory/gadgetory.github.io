mark 3 series of power supply i mean i'm
not going to i'm not going to do them
all this is the 600 watt but it's
actually available in a number of
different wattages this is sort of meant
to be an entry level and based on the
fact that the him ocz technology group
is using the pc power branding the
positioning of this is that it is a
value sort of low to medium wattage I
mean 600 watt I remember back when I go
into computers was like unheard of high
but a low to medium wattage quality
power supply it has a five year warranty
which is in line with what we expect
from the pc power and cooling brand here
are the connectors that are included the
non-modular and the flat black modular
cable double look at those once we open
it up what else we got on here look at
that true to form a pc power power
supply has a single 12 volt rail so a
single strong 12 volt rail means you
don't have to worry about what you
connect to what cable meticulous dizzily
designed with only premium components
including 105 degree capacitors so it
should provide its entire rated output
even at 50 degree ambient temperatures
which is pretty absurd that's a little
bit on the high side for what you'd
expect 80 plus bronze efficiency means
that while it's better than the standard
80 plus it's not going to be as
expensive as some of the 80 plus silver
and 80 plus gold power supplies in this
wattage range which haven't been that
popular just due to the price increase
engineered for you modular power cables
yep he's mine with the five year
warranty and engineering experience
dating back over 25 years okay what else
we got here technical specifications
continued output rated yet okay large
temperature controlled 120ml double ball
bearing fan compliant all your usual
protective circuitry including over
voltage over power over short circuit
hmm that's funny no over current I mean
maybe that's what they need about over
power but maybe you know some of the
electrical engineers in the audience can
post a comment and let me know what they
think does overpower
overcurrent protection alright modular
cables included not all of them are flat
black you can see there are some rated
ones so our modular PCI Express
connectors are braided and then the
modular peripheral connectors are not
braided we've got an instruction manual
which presumably shows you how to plug
the power supply into various things yes
it does okay we've got some included
black zip ties for included screws for
mounting the power supply we've got the
usual closed cell nice high durability
foam here and then we've got a great
look to this particular power supply
that would actually make it go very well
with one of the other things that I have
here that's behind me the phantom 410
which I'll be unboxing soon so we have a
white and black finish that feels
already incredibly durable so it's a bit
of a textured finish that is going to be
about a scratch proof as I think the
power supply finish is going to get and
then you've got kind of silver accents
so white black silver color scheme and
let's have a look at the included cables
before we look too closely at the power
supply unit itself so let me just undo
this so we can check the lengths here
alright so our 24-pin connector is a non
modular cable as as we expected and it
is about one Linus arm in length just a
little bit less okay and then we've got
one in okay this is interesting so this
is a sort of a different mix of
reconnected cables than what I've seen
in the past so we have a single pcie 6
plus 2 pin included and this goes on
yeah that side right there so that's a 6
or an 8 pin and then we have a single
included four plus four so that's your
8-pin eps connector oh not one is about
yay long so unless you have a tall case
you're probably not going to have to get
an extension although if you do have a
tall case you probably will have to get
an extension with this guy then we have
aha okay so we have another included for
another four plus for this is a modular
one so that would go there and then we
have another six plus two so you have up
to
28 pins and two PCI Express connectors
with this power supply and then I would
have normally like to see a few more
modular peripheral connectors but let's
see what they've included here okay so
we have three molex we have a three sada
and then we have a three SATA and yeah
like I said I would normally like to see
more peripheral connectors included in
fact in this case with this power supply
they have included actually for
peripheral connections on the power
supply unit itself but only three actual
cable harnesses to go on them so you're
left with one additional one I guess if
you find another one that happens to be
compatible than you could use that
normally ok modular power supplies to be
the point of the modular power supply
and why they originally came out was
cable management so that was one and
then the second generation of modular
power supplies was more about options so
that was back when a lot of the
standards were really changing sometimes
we had molex connectors on the backs of
video cards sometimes we had PCI Express
sometimes we had a 20 pin sometimes we
had a 24-pin connector on the
motherboard sometimes we had a four pin
or an eight pin at the top sometimes you
had ide drives using your four pin
standard molex and sometimes you had
SATA drives using the SATA power
connector so that was why modular power
supplies were so important because it
gave you the option of which cables to
install so I always used to get a bit of
a chuckle out of modular power supplies
that only included exactly as many
cables as fit in the in the sockets on
the power supply itself because I was
like oh well then you're not really
having any options at all you're just
plugging in whatever you need so it sort
of gets the one point where you get
improved cable management and better
internal appearance but if this is the
other point which is giving you options
in terms of what you want to install and
I've never seen one that comes with
fewer cables than actual sockets so it's
possible if someone bought one of these
already and it does normally come with
more cables this was a review unit so
it's possible they made a mistake so let
post a comment and let us know but there
you go there's my little spiel about
that so on the top of the unit we find
the general specs again which we already
saw on the outside so it's up to 550 550
to watts on the 12 volt rail total power
600 watts continuous so some power
supplies are not rated for continuous
waters this particular one is and it
better be any good quality power supply
is rated for continuous wattage on the
side here you see the silencer MK 3
branding on the bottom we've got a nice
little silencer MK 3 badge with our 120
ml cooling fan on the side we find also
right side up again I love seeing this
because for the longest time some
manufacturers we're putting them right
side up and right side up which means
that when you actually go and install it
in the case it would be upside down if
you wanted your fan side up which I
usually prefer so there you have it and
then on the back we find when has become
standard honeycomb mesh and on/off
switch and our power port I don't think
I showed you but it does include a power
cable as well so thank you for checking
out my unboxing your first look at the
