our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
linksys this is it guys Intel is finally
serious business about smartphones so
they have not only Medfield on display
which is running at 1.6 gigahertz here
and is actually running at 2 gigahertz
on the motorola razr I over there she's
a very very cool so it's the first
smartphone to run it 2 gigahertz they
are also introducing their Lexington
platform which runs at one point two
gigahertz now both of these platforms
are single course but they both run
hyper-threading technology which means
that while the processor is waiting for
data from the memory can go do other
stuff and from the word on the street
we're hearing that it is competitive
particularly the Medfield platform with
first-generation quad core processors in
a lot of different areas not only
performance but also in terms of battery
life now check this out this guy behind
me has actually been running that phone
all day it's still got about seventy
percent battery he's streaming over HDMI
playing a game while he was playing a
game until he started talking to that
gentleman so he's been playing a game at
1080p on the TV right here that is the
1.6 gigahertz platform which is not even
the premium one now that lower and
Lexington one is actually targeted
smarted phones under two hundred dollars
which is extremely exciting especially
in regions outside of north america
where things are still more developing
the economy is developing and people are
looking for a cheaper platform that
doesn't necessarily compromise in terms
of the functionality in the performance
