essentially a mini version of the
carbide air 540 there are 240 is about
40% smaller than its bigger brother and
designed for em ATX and mitx
motherboards while maintaining the dual
chamber design with the purchase of a
qualifying Intel processor SSD or nook
you could instantly win and Intel gaming
Jersey and be entered in the draw for
the ultimate system click now to learn
more once you get it out of the box
you'll notice the packing material which
is well hard foam and bad in terms of
the actual case we'll start from the
front of the aggressively stylized
housing where you'll be greeted by a
pair of power and reset buttons that
feel fantastic and have great audible
and tactile feedback along with these
two buttons you'll find a storage usage
led audio jacks and dual USB 3.0 ports
once we come around to the back of the
unit we see a glorious amount of thumb
screws which is the result of the remove
ability of the top bottom and both side
panels the left side panel has a very
large polycarbonate window which will
allow you to show off all of your main
components I'm very happy then with a
large window here as with even very
minimal cable management it is quite
easy to make your rig look pretty
amazing due to the decluttered dual
chamber design next up is the right side
panel where an externally mounted fan
filter is found which is actually quite
well secured by its magnets and even
shaking the case like a crazy man didn't
dislodge it which is nice to see as I
was worried about it falling off the
second I laid eyes on both the left and
right side panels featured these nice
thumb screws that stayed attached to the
side panels when you removed them but
courser didn't bother to include this
feature on the bottom and top panels
which is quite unfortunate as you will
be needing to remove them from time to
time first we have the bottom panel
which will need to be removed in order
to access the filter which is built into
the bottom panel that filter will be
filtering the three potential fans which
can be mounted in the bottom of the case
and your lowest mounted graphics card
unit the bottom panel also doesn't come
with any feet installed but in the
accessories bag you'll find for 3m
rubber feet which you can install
yourself a fairly odd choice from
Corsair not to just pre install them but
I guess it would be really nice if you
want to have the case in a different
orientation secondly we have the top
panel which will also need to be removed
due to its built-in fan filter which
will filter your top three potential
other than that the top panel is also
used to house the SSD cage as these are
quite easy to install in this cage due
to its bendable tray system but I would
have really liked to see a hot swab
plate on the other side due to the
drives being installed somewhat
externally it would have made the
installation of them much more elegant
before we head on inside we have to
check out the hard drive cage which is
accessed from the back of the unit just
above the power supply I was happy to
see that the thumb screw of this little
door with stayed attached to the door
once you removed it although I do think
it would be kind of cool if the door was
on hinge
instead of needing to be completely
removed whenever you want to open it the
hard drives are installed in the same
style as the SSDs with the bendable tray
solution and just like the SSDs I would
have liked to see a hotspot plate on the
other side and yet again it would have
made a much more elegant process inside
the back of the case we get to see the
internal views of those storage bays the
installed SSDs aren't the easiest things
to plug cables into needing to come up
from the bottom it doesn't really make
it that much better but it's generally
ok the hard drive cage is easy enough to
use for hard drives but also stands
directly in the way of your CPU power
cable and your CPU cut out on the back
of your motherboard Corsairs solution
for this is a thumb screw which is
included with the hard drive k making it
removable and this makes the CPU cutout
very easy to access but doesn't solve
the problem for the CPU power run issue
I was able to run the CPU power cable
for my Coursera RM 850 behind the cage
and mash the cage back into its spot
while pinning it down with one hand and
installing the thumb screw which
ultimately held it in place with the
other this works but only because the
cable was flat and I would never
actually recommend you do this what I
would have liked to see Corsair do was
cut a hole in the hard drive cage that
lines up with the CPU power cut out this
would allow you to opt out of installing
a third hard drive in exchange for a
clean and easy CPU power cable run
instead of the current solutions which
are messy power cable run and a hard
drive bay or clean power cable run and
no hard drive bay neither of those
solutions sound like a very fun
compromise to me there are plenty of
people management loops on the back but
I didn't bother use them I'm not super
worried about having a cable nest back
there as it isn't exactly blocking any
crucial airflow and you won't really
have to look at it due to the awesome
dual chamber design then we finally come
to the inside of the main check
we're again due to the dual chamber
design we see very clean and
great-looking aesthetic especially when
viewed through the side panel window it
would be hard to make this build not
look fantastic
due to how naturally clean the case
appears if you opted to go with an al
liquid cooling unit you will be likely
installing it in the front due to
restricted space above the motherboard
limiting you to just fans load a
radiator or just a radiator without fans
that being said the front of the case is
close enough to your CPU socket that
pretty much any cooler should work and
while it's possible to install a liquid
cooler with tubes on the bottom making
it work would kind of sacrifice
aesthetic a lot and it wouldn't really
fit very well either this is what led me
to notice something with an M ATX
motherboard which is what I expect a lot
of people to install in this case due to
its size and an air liquide cooler in
the optimal position having the tubes at
the top
you really can't access as many fan
spots as I'd hoped you're able to
install one fan of the top with the rest
being obstructed by your AAA O liquid
coolers tubing and it's likely that none
of your bottom fans can be installed to
either the radiator or the headers on
the motherboard instructing those next
up we have the 280 millimeter fans in
the back which I don't expect many
people to be rushing to fill 80
millimeter fans are notorious for being
audibly annoying of course there are
exceptions to that but because of this I
very rarely see them being implemented
that leaves us with the 120 millimeter
case fan in the back of the unit
which is going to essentially mostly
cool your cables so effectively with a
dual rad a i/o liquid cooler and an M
ATX board you will likely have your
radiator fans and one fan in the top of
the case but this thing is called an air
240 and if you installed an air cooler
you can avoid some of these issues and
be able to fill the top of the case with
fans
another thing that deserves its time in
the spotlight is the graphics card
installation system which is very easy
to use due to its hinge mechanism and
the fact that it doesn't require any
screws at all due to the ability to
install an M ATX motherboard and the
fact that the case is quite long you'll
be able to use this installation system
to plug in up to two graphics cards at a
maximum length of 290 millimeters and
last but not least is the case blackout
the HD audio does have a little bit of
color on the end but all of the other
included cables are completely black and
the rest of the case is completely
as well including the soft rubber
grommets this will allow the case to
suit virtually any color scheme you
throw at it and this yet again caters to
be great aesthetic of the air to 40
speaking of great aesthetics today's
