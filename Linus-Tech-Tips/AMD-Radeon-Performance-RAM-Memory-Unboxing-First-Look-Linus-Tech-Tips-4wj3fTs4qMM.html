AMD doesn't make memory you might say to
which I would reply AMD also doesn't
technically make CPUs now that they
don't have their own fabs however that
does not prevent AMD from qualifying and
validating and marketing memory with the
right partner so in the case of their
CPUs their partners are guys like Global
Foundries which is actually a spin-off
of AMD's old old fats in this case I am
not going to tell you who the partner is
for the memory but I think you'll be
able to figure it out by the time I'm
done with the video so I'm not gonna
take a look at the oh shoot what are
they called
right entertainment performance and
radio and great memories separately this
is going to be more of an overview of
what doesn't what is an AMD memory in
general rather than looking at every
single grain but entertainment is the
lowest end performances the mid grade
and then Radeon is the high end so this
is performance this is CL 8 1.5 volt
1333 megahertz
Ram it says 2 by 4 gig kit you're not
gonna find any triple or quantity C PS
are all using dual channel controllers
from the a sixes and eights the AP use
of the world that is combination CPU
GPUs on one chip all the way up to their
Black Edition FX chips so AMD prefer
let's see what they have to say for
themselves AMD performance addition DDI
ddr3 memory kits are specifically
designed for the latest generation AMD
processors they utilize the profile heat
spreaders for enhanced cooling
performance but using high quality
pre-screened ICS
and vigorously tested these AMD
performance additional modules are a
hundred percent hand tested for quality
assurance backed by a lifetime warranty
an industry leading customer support so
here's something interesting for you
guys I actually do know for a fact that
they do use pre-screened ICS and they
actually lock it down to a particular
build that is to say a bomb bill Bill of
Materials so what that means is that
every AMD performance 13:33 CLA kit
is using pretty much the same components
as every other one now okay yeah isn't
it always like that you might ask to
which I would reply absolutely not you
know look at a performance memory brands
such as Corsair on the side of their
memory you'll often see revision 1.1 1.2
2.1 2.2 2.3 all the way up to I've seen
revision numbers as high as double
digits on Corsair memory so they are
often changing the components which
isn't to say that's a bad thing because
particularly for high grade memory chips
especially back in the ddr2 days it was
often necessary to change the components
in order to get the yields they needed
to hit those high speeds what does that
mean if for the end user it means that
if you're upgrading you're exactly the
same part number might not necessarily
even work and dual-channel with your
other exactly the same part number but
different revision ram it also means if
you're building 10 systems at a time and
you have five that are one revision and
five that are another revision you right
mike run into issues where one doesn't
work with another which brings us to the
point of all of this AMD released memory
so that they would be sure that any AMD
memory would work in any AMD motherboard
without any fuss hold on a second okay
miss generation okay built and supported
by picture of memory LLC so there you go
so yes it is a very very well known
lifetime warranty actually still builds
modules in north america brand that is
building and supporting these for AMD
they have black PCBs which i think is a
must on anything that you're gonna call
performance Edition which is on the
other side and then you got your sort of
standard part number built by Patriots
II it's not really a secret really
warranty void if remove you don't take
this off there's a little profile he'd
saying I think that pretty much wraps it
up thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at AMD memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
