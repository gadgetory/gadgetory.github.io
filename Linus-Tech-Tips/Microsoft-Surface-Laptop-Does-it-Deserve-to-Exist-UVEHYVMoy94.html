something that is flat but unlike every
other product in the surface line up the
surface laptop cannot be laid down flat
so then with the ease of drawing and
note-taking removed can the surface
laptop stand out among the other
plain-jane thin and light laptops on the
market we're not sure maybe you can help
us decide
rockettes sq+ Force FX features
pressure-sensitive qwe a si D keys which
can be configured in three different
modes for multiple functions check it
out now at the link below so there are a
handful of different colors surface
laptops available but unexpectedly we
actually really like our burgundy one I
wouldn't say that its design screams
professional but when you first meet it
it definitely gives you a clear plastic
binder with the arguments for its
professionalism laid out in a clear and
convincing manner and after the
interview every interaction with the
surface laptop feels premium with
virtually zero chassis flex and a solid
screen hinge both of which are made even
more impressive by the fact that they
were achieved in a device that weighs in
at only 2.76 pounds the battery life is
also what I would describe as very
respectable managing over six hours in
our work battery test although it should
be noted that won't be quite enough to
completely free you from the charger
like the over nine hours recorded with
the second gen LG Graham specs wise our
model packs just enough punch to make
not doing a whole lot feel nice and
snappy so don't expect to run games or
edit epic videos with the integrated
graphics but this middle-of-the-road
core i5 with eight gigs of ram and an
entry-level 256 gig nvme SSD is
well-suited to surfing the internet or
writing up documents in office as well
as light multitasking a word of warning
though make sure when you spec out your
surface laptop you've got enough storage
and RAM when you buy since there is no
obvious way to open up the sealed
chassis and therefore no easy way to
upgrade this thing once it leaves the
factory the screen continues to be a
really strong point for the entire
surface lineup avid movie watchers may
not appreciate the black bars that come
along with the three by two aspect ratio
but the surface laptops
high resolution and factory color
calibrated IPS display make it a treat
to use for daily tasks and even suitable
for some light photo work on the go the
touch capabilities are excellent and the
top mounted infrared equipped webcam is
great for Windows hello
and while not the most amazing looking
or sounding on a business call or in an
emergency it would surely do you fine as
or a bomb look come on look at this
thing what do i do how do I get rid of
this thing alright calm down how come I
told those with jealousy clear view of
this bomb and you're gonna have to snip
the glue stick
snip the glue stick where did you go to
ordnance disposal school what are the
bomb is this anyway
red wire or blue wire red wire blue wire
I can see that there is no red wire
there there the day is saved but with
that said fans of the surface product
line expecting a great stylist
experience are going to be how you say
majorly bummed out because the
usefulness of the screen is hampered by
not being able to fold the surface
laptop flat it's compatible with the
surface pen and dial for that matter but
while the hinge is easily strong enough
to prevent screen wobble during regular
use it is not strong enough that I'd be
comfortable drawing on it and unlike the
surface book
it can't be flipped all the way around
the good news is that lots of people who
weren't fans of Microsoft's existing
devices won't care about that at all and
for them a touchpad is a perfectly good
alternative and perfectly good it is
it's glass topped with a very satisfying
click and almost no weird behavior
during our testing in fact it's so good
that if it was between the touchpad and
the arc mouse that Microsoft also sent
over I'd stick with the touchpad the
idea of having a mouse with built-in
touch on the top for scrolling that
folds flat for portability is pretty
appealing but it's a
how you say shockingly uncomfortable
back to good stuff though and boy is it
good this keyboard has inspired us to
start a laptop keyboard hall-of-fame and
put this in it I don't know how they
managed to make a keyboard this thin
feel so darn good but it's freaking
amazing once I finished writing up this
review on it I just wanted to keep on
typing to feel the keys they're smooth
but tactile feel accentuated by the soft
Alcantara palm rest and the better
weight distribution for easy in lap
operation make this machine with its
keyboard possibly the best word on the
go device that I've yet encountered but
what if you want to use programs other
than word well haha funny story the
surface laptop comes pre-loaded with
Windows 10 s so as long as those other
programs are either the edge internet
browser or available in the Windows
Store then you're good to go because
that's all that runs on Windows 10 s but
hold on before you power users out there
freak out Windows 10 Pro is a free
upgrade that only takes a few seconds so
we did that on the subject of freaking
out the surface laptop stayed calm cool
and quiet avoiding any sort of thermal
throttling even under synthetic loads a
feat again made all the more impressive
by the fact that we had a heck of a time
even figuring out where the darn air
intake was and to round out the good
stuff the stereo speakers which are
positioned under the keyboard are great
I mean they're not gonna floor you but
given how thin this guy is it's
impressive how much sound Microsoft was
able to pack into it okay so up until
now this has been a really positive
review of the surface laptop because
it's mostly pretty sick but
unfortunately there is one subjectively
massive blemish the i/o IMO really
misses the mark then flies across a
field and get stuck in your great-aunts
horrible
I do with only a single USB type a one
mini-display port and a headphone jack
don't expect to be connecting much to it
at a time and Microsoft if you're
watching guys if you're going to force
people to dongle their way through life
at least have the courtesy to include a
non-proprietary USB C or Thunderbolt
port the surface dock that connects to
the power connector of the surface
laptop does greatly expand its i/o but
it costs a whopping 200 u.s. dollars
money that could be spent on a thin and
light notebook with more i/o or faster
Hardware or both but with that said you
would be making other sacrifices the LG
gram 2017 might be more easily
upgradable and lighter with a bigger
battery and more ports but its build
quality is vastly inferior at the same
price for the same spec so bottom line
then the surface laptop is a great
notebook that with the addition of a
Thunderbolt 3 port would be nearly
perfect as long as you can afford it I
cannot say enough good things about the
iFixit pro tech tool kit it's super easy
to use the tools are quick enough to
access that even when you're on a
crowded show floor you can whip that
thing out and start disassembling
laptops and monitors and all in ones and
pretty much you name it and I fix this
site is the resource you need to use
your iFixit pro tech tool kit to fix and
or upgrade your devices because gosh
darn it you own them so why shouldn't
you be able to do that it's got all
kinds of great tools like their suction
cups their prying tools their
screwdrivers and an esd-safe strap and
the best part is it's backed by I fix
its lifetime warranty so head over to
ifixit.com slash Linus and use code
Linus at checkout to save five bucks
on your purchase of $10 or more oh and
if you're in Canada you can check them
out at amazon.ca for cheaper shipping so
