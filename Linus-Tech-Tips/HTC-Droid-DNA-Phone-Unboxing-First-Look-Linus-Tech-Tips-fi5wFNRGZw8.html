the droid DNA from HTC this is called in
other regions the butterfly J but there
are a couple of changes that have been
made most notably the removal of the
microSD expansion slot so this is
something that has caused a little bit
of ire but if you're like me and you've
never actually gone over the 16 gigs of
space on your iPhone then it's probably
less of an issue for you so for starters
we are going to go ahead and open the
box because that's apparently what we do
on this channel now you'll notice we've
got our dual cam setup but we've made
some improvements so we're hoping that
you guys will appreciate them number one
is there's no audio clicking that is
something that we did figure out a way
to resolve number two is we've got the
colors matching better on the cameras
and number three is you shouldn't see
any weird motion blur as I'm opening up
the box here the box is extremely tight
so you can tell this is a fresh non
deflowered phone that has never been
used before in a way that would be
undesirable to the upcoming owner of it
so here we go just pull a little tab
open here the phone comes out the first
thing you'll notice about the droid DNA
is it's absolutely huge the second thing
you might notice if you did any reading
about it whatsoever is that the screen
is actually not 720p like most phones
these days yes it is a 1080p screen that
is actually in an area that is smaller
than a galaxy note 2 so that's the one
that I have here for comparison that
means you have a massive 440 pixels per
inch of pixel density which actually
just well demolishes pretty much
everything else for comparison and
iPhone 5 is 326 pixels per inch so let's
go ahead and open up some more stuff
here there's a Verizon start here
there's a sim tray removal tool handy
dandy I'm not really much of a phone guy
but I'd imagine you need that if you're
going to change your SIM card which has
something to do with connecting to the
interwebs or something like that start
here guide aha
Spanish because this is not a Canadians
phone global support information in
calling card consumer holy crap
look wasn't it look at this it's like
the end it's like a clown car of stuff
so there's a SIM card that presumably
would be included if you were an actual
Verizon customer which I'm not and
finally a couple of HTC stickers let's
go ahead and pull this out like the
packaging very plain black which of
course makes it easy for us to show you
all the black products against the black
packaging on the black table includes a
charging cable so there's your mini I
rather micro USB charging cable okay
also includes a wall wart and that is
pretty much it once we power up the
phone obviously the first thing you're
going to notice about it is that 1080
screen another thing you might notice is
that HTC has altered the UI the stock UI
for Android a little bit so they're
calling it their sense 4 plus UI some
people are familiar with this some
people aren't I am not so I don't really
have any comments on it right now in
terms of the overall layout of the phone
on the top you've got actually look at
that everything is labeled on this
handy-dandy little thing that I pulled
off without actually looking at it more
than once so this is a power and lock
key on the top you've also got your
headphone jack here that's how you get
access to the SIM tray on this side
you've got volume up and volume down as
well as a gorgeous-looking red accented
speaker grille so this is actually look
at that that's a metal button it feels
very nice on the bottom you find a USB
oh there we go
USB charging port and that is pretty
much it so there's not much in terms of
buttons on the other side you find
another red accented speaker grille on
the back you find the camera so the rear
camera is 8 megapixel the front camera
is 2.1 megapixel the rear camera will
take 1080p video and the front camera
will take 720p video there's an included
LED flash one other thing that you guys
might care about about this particular
phone is that it actually has two
indicator lights on it so there's one on
the front of the phone as well as one on
the back so that just means that if I
were getting some choppy framerate there
but we're not so that just means that no
matter how you put the phone down on
your nightstand if you have a missed
notification or whatever else then
you're going to be able to check it out
and make sure that you don't well not
being able to check it out so other
things that are included oh right
actually I should talk about this so HTC
has acquired the rights for the whole
Beats Audio thing so that's no longer
going to be that's no longer gonna be
available on sort of such a weird
variety of products HTC owns that so
this phone as well as the Windows Phone
8x which will be checking out soon
actually have Beats Audio so what does
that mean Beats Audio inherently doesn't
necessarily mean anything because dr.
Dre does not actually use beats by dre
headphones when he's recording in the
studio I hope you guys know this I
really hope you know this but what it
does mean in the case of this particular
phone the Droid DNA is that it does have
a headphone amp built into it so if
nothing else if you are using headphones
or earbuds that are higher impedance
than normal you're going to actually be
able to drive those at a reasonable
volume compared to phones that do not
have a headphone amp built-in so
hopefully once I've had a chance to
actually try it out a little bit I'll be
able to say a bit more about that
looking closer at the screen again I
just want to take a moment to talk about
the difference between Super LCD 3 &amp;amp;
Ammo LEDs such as what's used on popular
phones like say for example that one
that everyone buys the galaxy s3 from
Samsung so amo LED has the advantage of
giving you deeper blacks because you can
actually turn the pixels off they can
stop emitting light however the
disadvantage is sometimes text can be
not quite as sharp and not quite as
crisp because it doesn't use dedicated
sub pixels so it's just a slightly
different display technology I also
suspect that the availability of screens
that are capable of running out of 440
pixels per inch density and at 1080p
resolution for mo LED would be less and
that that would also be a significant
expense to add to the overall phone
because at the end of the day you can
produce as exciting a piece of
technology as you want but if absolutely
no one or their dog or their dogs fetch
etai or whoever else if no one can
afford it then it's kind of a nonce
non-starter as far as that's concerned
so other cool cool features it's got
wireless charging which I personally
think is freaking awesome because the
first thing I would have complained
about on a phone like this is the fact
that it has micro USB like all other
Android phones seem to have an
hate micro-usb it just breaks all the
time it does support 4G LTE but not for
me see there's that 4G LTE logo on the
back not supported here in Canada with
this particular phone I think I'd have
to get a different version
oh yeah right so the hardware that's
running on this guy s4 pro the s4 pro
platform so that's a crate s4 pro is
actually the most powerful mobile
capable platform so normally you would
actually see one of the lower end
chipsets in a phone because of power
draw concerns but they've gone with not
only the s4 pro but also the fastest
Adreno 320 GPU to pair with it partly I
think because a it's a multimedia style
device it's a larger phone so if you
look at it in my hands you're gonna
notice that it's actually probably a
little bit too big for me I can only
reach about here to here but this phone
is going to be used by my wife anyway
and then the other thing is because of
the 1080p resolution you're gonna need a
powerful GPU just to draw basic things
like Android animated effects and have
them not lag out at all so it's running
jellybean which means that you do have
the project butter experience with
everything being smoother but without a
decent GPU even that could potentially
be compromised so let's go ahead and
just kind of check it I don't know if I
ever showed you guys the back in detail
so it's just I got a matte soft touch
finish on it looks great feels really
good what else am I missing here ah yes
back here 2.0 aperture lens so that just
basically means it lets in more light a
lower aperture is better it means less
light is lost through the lens which
means that in regardless of because you
can only put so big of a sensor inside a
device like this you can only put in so
much processing power before it just
doesn't start to make a difference at
all so you have to have excellent
clarity to the optics in order to
deliver as much light as possible
through the lens and onto the sensor
itself so that's actually part of HTC's
entire platform on this guy that is
called image sense so that is quick
image readiness so they're claiming 0.7
seconds from nothing to being ready to
take a photo
they're also they've also added things
like burst shot subject tracking you can
record a video
and then you can actually record still
images while you're recording a video
and have them saved separately which I
also think is kind of cool and they're
basically just saying it's kind of one
of those beats by audio beats by dre
audio beats branding things where
they're going okay we don't we can't
just list all of these features on the
phone so we're gonna call it image sense
and it's going to include the 2.0
aperture lens as well as all that extra
functionality in the photo taking
software itself I don't think we've
actually missed anything this particular
phone has two gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of
storage space unfortunately like I said
before it is not upgradable with micro
sd it does support NFC which is great as
more devices support NFC you might be
able to do things like whip your phone
out and unlock your door or I mean if
you're like me and you're lazy you could
just have the phone in your pocket just
be like yeah I just kind of jump up to
the door like that trying to unlock it
that way again I can't emphasize enough
how gorgeous the screen is the the text
that's overlaid right now that's showing
sort of pull down to see notifications
press and hold an empty space to add
widgets and shortcuts drag an app over
another to create a folder and drag your
favorite apps to the launch bar to
customize it it almost looks like like a
Inc over top of continue to show quick
tips sure why not continue to show quick
tips so let's go ahead and see if we can
see if we can get the brightness turned
up a little bit here Beats Audio it's
not available on the phone speaker okay
well that's interesting
makes sense I suppose brightness there
we go nope no automatic brightness I
want to crank it
aha there we are so it probably doesn't
help that it's kind of a dark background
there but you can see it's extremely
bright I'm gonna go ahead and have you
look at it from the side so the colors
do not change at all from the side and
in terms of just sort of whipping around
inside the UI here it's extremely snappy
I guess if we wanted to zoom or do
whatever else
okay so there's Google ringtone oh okay
I bump the ringtone there we go so we
want to sort of zoom around maybe let's
go to I don't know NCI XCOM and it would
help a lot if I hit the X correctly
never liked the Android the stock
Android keyboard as much as I like the
iOS keyboard button since there's lots
of options that you can change it to the
it should be fine so absolutely gorgeous
quick scrolling there we go
I think that pretty much concludes our
