something that I have been planning to
do for quite some time with this dead
gtx 780 Ti II see nothing not a dead no
signal boom done but had my hand forced
a little bit by the death of the intel
750 series SSD in personal rig update
2015 yes my friends while I was fixing
this lovely ek waterblock or more likely
while I was removing the stock heatsink
the 750 series SSD died so we are going
to use a tried-and-true well that
definitely tried and hopefully true
method of bringing it back to life
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more alright so I
know technically you're not supposed to
run it with no heatsink no that is not
how it died I am only running it for a
couple seconds to demonstrate that it is
in fact not working before we get
started here this is a lot faster than
putting the stock heatsink back on it
since I'm going to have to remove that
to attempt my resurrection anyway and
give me configuration nothing
also this monitor does that sometimes
boom dead drive here we go so the
science behind this resurrection method
is actually fairly simple whether due to
heating and cooling therefore expanding
contracting or some other type of
physical stress the theory is that some
of the solder joints on the board
between the chips and the PCB could have
become broken over time and by heating
up the component to the melting
temperature of that solder you could
allow it to reflow and reconnect
becoming fully functional again but
before we get into all the stuff you'll
need to perform this particular little
miracle I want to start with a hefty
disclaimer this will void the crap out
of any warranty you may still have so if
your product is covered by the retailer
or manufacturer warranty do not do this
instead go through the proper warranty
channels in my case both my video card
and my SSD are review samples with
therefore no warranty coverage
whatsoever so we have pretty much
nothing to lose at this point
except our time and if you're going to
watch this video I guess yours as well
so let's run through we got here we have
ourselves a Wolfgang Puck oven that was
generously donated by Luc to Linus media
group because Linus Media Group's
employees made it so filthy and
disgusting that he pretty much doesn't
want it anymore so I'll be cleaning this
out before trying to repair any video
cards in it it's important to use an
oven that can reach three hundred and
eighty-five degrees
tight-end that you never intend to cook
food in ever again because as the guide
that I'm following on overclockers from
like 2009 pointed out if you are
reheating stuff like this in an oven
there can be gases and materials LED off
that can contaminate future food that to
cook inside it the next thing we'll need
is screwdrivers for taking apart our
components our SSD is conveniently
already disassembled but the video card
will need its heatsink removed then we
will need aluminum foil this will be to
wrap the oven tray as well as to
separate the PCB from the oven tray
we'll show you guys how to do this later
on and we will need some replacement
thermal compound for our hardware for
when we reassemble it assuming that it
survives the baking process alright so
let's get to cleaning then you oh that's
gross all right we haven't those ah cuz
Yvan wouldn't let us get one and asked
why we don't have a hose see she doesn't
deny it
that's why isn't it I wanted a hose I
also wanted like a utility sink out
there I don't think it the large ones
it's like whoever bought these forgot
that I work here swimming in there
one for that and I take good one
here's a funny idea
anyone who leads their dishes in the
sink on washed I'll wash it with this
look at that it's like wearing right
through the scouring pad yeah I've never
used it either
I suspect Brandon and Terry you look at
this one there's like a hanger in here
oh gotta be cheese
okay so this is a really short cord but
that's okay because that's why extension
cords exist they're not a huge fan of
running like an oven off an extension
cord
okay here we go
standard baked convection bake slow cook
roast royal patisserie was - standard
bake temperature 385 or 375 it doesn't
make a sound when it reaches the I would
think so should go deep so we can use
the time while our oven is preheating to
strip down our video card that
definitely stinks that is gross oh and
it smells like cancer yeah it smells
like an oven that hasn't been turned on
any year and that was disgusting the
last time it was turned on now this is
one key difference between stripping
down a card for water cooling for
example and stripping down a card for
baking is that you're actually going to
want to remove as many of the plastic
housings on things like fan or LED
connectors as you can make sure you note
the orientation as you pull them off
otherwise you're going to have a bad
time putting them back together don't
try to take off stuff like the PCI
Express power connector housings those
will survive the bake just fine oh shoot
oh I'm an idiot
oh wow oh that smoke that is so gross
okay well I have to pull the tray out
because you're supposed to wrap it okay
damnit Oh weird it's like curling can
you not do that mr. Trey thank you so
this yeah this is cool enough now so
let's wrap this baby up now the guy
doesn't say shiny side out or shiny side
in but that looks like the shiny side
out
it's amazing how how many like non
baking people will not realize that
aluminum has a reflective side and on
that side for not reflecting as much yep
you'll learn something every day every
day that you watch this show it should
be every day you have videos every day
now the next step is to create little
aluminum balls just like that we're
going to use these to keep the PCB of
our SSD or graphics card off of the tray
itself it's important not to position
them on top of one of the components
that we want to resolder so you want
this just touching the bare PCB which
might make it a little tricky just be
careful and go slow I think this side is
probably my best bet but then this is
probably the side I think was most
likely damaged by removing it so maybe I
want hmm okay I went like this
I wish I had smaller balls aluminum
balls so let's make sure we're not
making contact with anything we
shouldn't be any surface mount
components or anything like that looks
like we're good that's at 385 standard
bake okay
let's get baked okay timer start start
start timer
I don't know well okay it's 4:33 so at
4:41 we pull it out and hope for the
best
we should never for that hope for the
best
that's why you only need one glove
because it can do up to five at a time
although that might be a bit of a
bottleneck I'm pretty sure it's working
it's hot until now okay this is a
terrible terrible situation because oh
no wait wait you don't mean it's okay ah
okay I need it to come out a little bit
further I don't want it to shift on
those balls valve okay here we go I got
to be dexterous with this glove okay now
we let it cool to room temperature it's
very cold in here maybe I'll cool it to
room temperature near the oven or on top
of the oven or well okay yeah I don't
want to put it down I don't to do is I
don't want to hold it the whole time
okay well I want to start baking the
video card here at some point yeah
no it's okay I'll just hold it actually
I think I can probably I can probably do
this without yeah there's like nothing
on in here so I'll just put one there
you out you okay
fulfill peril I had a gloved hand
okay I forgive you all right okay so the
video card is done now to definitely
warm ouch I'm just going to put this
here for now let's try the SSD come on
well there's lights on on it I don't
remember if it had those before oh I
don't see it in the boot priority thing
I don't know if it works
crap well I guess I might as well try
baking it one more time I don't have
anything to lose maybe I'll try flipping
it the other way this time the black
like under part of the sticker is still
there it's like the key but the barcode
is completely done by contrast our stick
there that we put in it is just fine
it's not the outcome I wanted but if the
GTX 780 Ti works then at least this is
for something because I can use this for
a new render server concept that I have
that I'll be building out pretty soon
with that sad I'm not going to count my
chickens at this stage in the game
anyway but let's see how it goes
come on baby let's get something out of
this exercise I'm pretty sure we should
have a display by now wait wait hey all
right so the video card is back from the
dead
rock on that's fantastic
alright let's take another crack at the
SS Steven oh crap I don't know how long
this has been done well what are we
going to do kill it more at this point
shut up Brandon oh wow
we overcooked it it looks dark I can't
tell I thought I saw steam rising oh you
know what is probably from actually oh
my goodness ow
oh my fingers no I think this team is
like accidentally spat a bit I think it
like well okay I'm not trying to just
spit all of it shut up
everyone just shut up one of the tricky
things is that different boards will use
different soldering techniques and
different solder materials so just
because something works well on a
graphics card made by Nvidia doesn't
mean that it works well on an SSD made
by Intel unfortunately I don't have like
special guidelines for 750 series SSDs
oh well you should use this temperature
for this long so we just have to kind of
hope for the best here the good news is
our 780 Ti is running the heav'n
benchmark with no issues whatsoever so
yeah take another crack at it eh
speaking of which mass drop if you guys
haven't heard of mass drop well I'm
sorry that you live in a hole because it
is pretty freakin cool all you got to do
is head over to master opcom sign up and
they've got all kinds of great deals
