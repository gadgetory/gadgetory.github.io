guys will make about max is number one
they're really expensive and number two
they're very difficult to upgrade so
I've actually been using the Mac for
over a month now as my daily driver and
quite frankly from a hardware
perspective the iMac 5k 27-inch retina
blah-de-blah this thing actually not
that bad especially if you look at the
projected price of other 5k displays and
the hardware that's included with it but
that's not the subject of today's video
for today's video we are going to be
cracking this bad boy open and talking
about the experience of upgrading the
hardware versus the experience of
upgrading the hardware on a typical PC
where in theory although I've never done
this before it is much easier so I
intentionally ordered a Mac that didn't
have a ton of storage didn't have a hard
drive so that I could add an SSD for
more storage in our case a one terabyte
class SSD now v3 10 from Kingston and I
ordered one with only eight gigs of ram
a to see how OS 10 handled the more you
know down-to-earth configuration and
be-because upgrade ram is so expensive
when you order the mac in the first
place that i wanted to instead throw in
some mac compatible ram in this case
we're going to be throwing in 32 gigs of
it also courtesy of kingston so come
along for the ride then guys we're going
to upgrade the iMac
ensure swift victory with Corsairs
highly responsive lightweight Gaming
Mouse the Sabre RGB click now to learn
more so I want to begin this adventure
with a couple of shout outs to our
buddies at Kingston who provided an SSD
for us to use in the hard drive slot of
our SSD on the iMac to add some not
quite PCIe fast but still very fast
solid-state storage and 32 gigs of there
Apple compatible so dim memory as well
as I fix it whose excellent guide and
tools we use throughout the
deconstruction process speaking of which
the first thing I noticed as I begun
this process was the tools required on a
typical PC I'd expect to be able to do
everything I needed with a standard
multi bit screwdriver from the local
hardware store and in most cases I'd
never use anything but the Philips head
on the Mac the process starts with a
special little pizza cutter tool and
requires credit cards a spudger Torx
screws throughout and finally some
custom cut adhesive strips for
reassembly so because you can't just up
and decide you're going to open it one
day for giggles the locals you know
store is unlikely to carry all that
stuff and the Mac uses non-standard
internals so you'll need to order any
replacement parts you need online anyway
there is a significant time barrier to
DIY Mac upgrades and repairs that will
deter a great many people from ever
attempting something like this
especially if their Mac is the only
computer they have and they need it back
up and running quickly the next thing I
noticed was the difficulty level
compared to a PC and I'm a cup grade is
much less friendly to newcomers
there's no remove the side panel realize
you're in over your head and bail I mean
once you cut the adhesive strips it's
basically point of no return
most of the connectors are these thin
fragile ribbon cables with tiny contact
pins on the ends that make even status
laughable 50 insertion rating look
robust and the internal guts need to be
handled with extreme care to avoid
damaging them and to avoid damaging
yourself the power
like contacts on the back of the PCB are
completely exposed but should not be
touched under any circumstances this
could severely injure or even kill you
disassembling the iMac was honestly
pretty nerve-wracking for me since I've
never done it before and the only time
I've done something even similarly
delicate was when I replaced the broken
screen on my wife's droid DNA phone
which was even then comparatively no big
deal since I was working with something
that was already broken in that case
with the iMac one slip-up could turn
into a $3,000 paperweight I'm
exaggerating a little bit you could
replace the dead components but still
very expensive so most people even with
an excellent written or video guide will
not be comfortable tackling this and the
final thing I noticed about the process
was the actual upgrade or modification
possibilities frankly there's just not a
lot you can do to the iMac once you've
finally got it open I was only about 30
minutes into my teardown and almost at
the part where I was ready to install my
shiny 960 gig SSD when I got to the step
in the guide that said to remove the
hard drive cable from the hard drive I
bought an SS the only iMac instead of a
fusion drive one so mine doesn't have a
hard drive or a hard drive cable I
called up I fix it to find out if we
could get a replacement cable
overnighted to us only to have them tell
me that because this model is so new
replacement cables are not available yet
the data connection is a standard one so
I actually considered just soldering a
standard SATA power lead on to the
proprietary header after checking the
voltages but upon further reading online
I discovered that even if we did find
one and put in an ad in Drive and solder
it together it's possible that the imax
fan would spin at full speed all the
time thanks to the hard drive
temperature detection not working
correctly
so I was defeated as far as the hard
drive upgrade was concerned but I
decided to finish the teardown for fun
and see what else we can change while
we're in here removing the power supply
speakers and logic board was all
surprisingly
okay pretty easy once we've made it this
far but honestly even stripping it down
that far reveals very few user swappable
components the hinge at the back could
be replaced with a vase a compatible one
if it was available separately but as it
is Apple requires you to decide at the
time of ordering the iMac which version
you want the SSD could be replaced if
Apple was allowing third-party vendors
to make replacement drives yet the
wireless module could be upgraded if it
wasn't already a top-of-the-line three
spatial stream AC module the graphics
card could be upgraded if it wasn't on
mobile GPU soldered to the motherboard I
mean I think you're starting to see a
pattern here
it basically leaves the CPU although
ours already has a 4790k in there so
there's nothing better to put in that
socket and the RAM which could just as
easily be accessed by pressing the
little release on the hatch at the back
of the Mac and doesn't require any sort
of teardown in order to swap at least
until our Apple overlords decide that we
are worthy of being allowed to upgrade
the other things inside so I guess all
that's left is the conclusion at this
point are the trade-offs that Apple
makes on the iMac 5k 27 inch with
respect to design function cost and
performance right or what I prefer they
did it differently as far as performance
is concerned I actually think for most
people this is a pretty good sweet spot
it uses a full desktop CPU although
we'll investigate thermal throttling in
an upcoming video
and while gamers might be mone the r9 to
95 m GPU I will remind them that this is
not a gaming machine and frankly even a
gaming GPU won't be playing triple-a
titles at 5k anyway the cost is almost
justifiable in my mind for the hardware
that you're getting and if the 5k
display could be recycled for another
computer afterwards and that would be a
slam dunk for me and the design is
subjectively beautiful but where the Mac
really let me down was in terms of the
upgrade ability not because it can't be
upgraded well enough it's actually more
easily modifiable than many other super
slim devices mostly notebooks and
especially tablets but because Apple
locks down what few choices I had for
hardware changes forcing me other than
RAM to pay far too much for upgrades to
what is also a very expensive machine in
the first place at the checkout as a
tinkerer and a hardware geek the iMac
27-inch 5k Retina just doesn't make
sense to me but I can hope that that
will change over time as it becomes
slightly less shiny and slightly less
new and we're allowed to put slightly
other more different things inside
speaking of things that I hope will
change over time the way that mobile
carriers operate I'd love to see more of
them work the same way as today's
episode sponsor ting comm ting lets you
pay for only the talk text and data that
you use they use the Sprint network as
their backbone rather than a janky small
one and with the rates that they offer
over 90% of the US customers that they
pulled would save money by switching to
ting so to find out if you would save
money just go ahead over to the link in
the video description and use their
savings calculator and if you like what
you see until January 5th 2015
ting will even pitch in up to 50% of the
cost to terminate your current contract
up to a hundred and fifty bucks then
starting in February any GSM compatible
devices that's like 80% of smartphones
out there in the US will be able to be
used on the Tang Network including the
iPhone 6 and 6-plus
whoo so head over to ting calm / - to
get 25 bucks in device or service credit
