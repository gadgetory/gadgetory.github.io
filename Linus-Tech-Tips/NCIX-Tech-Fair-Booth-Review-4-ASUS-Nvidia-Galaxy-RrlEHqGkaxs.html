preview I said he Sue's had a wide
variety of products here but I only
showed like one motherboard no no they
have more stuff than that a sous is
involved in everything monitors
all-in-one PCs notebooks tablets
motherboards video cards networking even
cases I think although not really in
North America so let's have a look at
what they got here number one they have
a g54 yet so this is part of the gaming
series that is also populated by the g74
which is the seventh er grounders yeah
the 17 inch version this is the 15 inch
version these are I've actually done an
unboxing of a g-53 at one point so these
are super beefy gaming machines with
huge cooling vents at the back and
basically the republic of gamers edition
of what a notebook would be next we've
got the asuste transformer pad tf300 so
this is kind of a lower-cost version of
the transformer prime it uses a plastic
back instead of the metal back and
personally I actually prefer this I've
talked about the galaxy tab 10.1 how I
like the plastic back because you don't
worry about scratching it or like
staining it with your fingerprints
this makes sense to me
alright moving object goes with it so
the robot walk adds not only a keyboard
and additional expansion including not
that way USB as well as an SD slot but
it also adds additional battery life so
when you dock you can have up to 15
hours of battery life between the
battery that's in here and the battery
that's in here together and also have a
touchpad which you can use to navigate
the android OS has on it finally the
zenbook so the zenbook is one that i
actually did a full NCIX tech geeks
episode on and at that time the zenbook
had a bit of a quirk we're down here the
touchpad was non-responsive you can see
with the latest n book the mouse cursor
is moving can you see the movie even
though I'm touching all of the touchpad
it continues to move the spine so the
zenbook the one problem that I might
have had with it gone let's move around
to the other side of the sister
here we brought one of their all in ones
this is also something that I've done
video coverage of in the past although I
had windows 8 preview running on and it
looks like they've only got windows
seven so my video is definitely cooler
from last time than this one but it's a
pretty neat little all-in-one machine
it's owned by NCIX detectives Jenna
we've also got a couple of their of
their high-end networking products
including a wireless router here as well
as another other more different wireless
router here so this is the rtn 66u Dark
Knight this is a phenomenally popular
router at NCIX right now I actually
don't know too much about it myself but
i can tell you we're selling a lot of
them and they aren't coming back so
that's as strong an endorsement as their
candy on the other side of the ACS bored
bored booth we have their motherboards
so we have everything from their rampant
our republic of gamers maximus five gene
so this is basically all of the features
that you would find in a full-size ATX
gaming machine except in a mini eight
our micro ATX form factor so that is sli
and crossfire compatible compatibility
awesome cooling all the i/o that you
could possibly need except for that
additional three expansion slots we've
also got the sabertooth z77 which i
think I've covered pretty thoroughly
already it looks like some of the dust
covers have walked off but yeah one of
them still on here that's where one of
the fan skills that's where the other
fan goes so it's got their thermal armor
which allows you to basically keep all
the components cool and free of dust
we've also got excuses
series 27-inch life is compatible 3d
display as you guys probably know if you
watch my show I pretty much don't
believe you should be buying a 3d
display unless you get one with like
this it makes an enormous difference in
terms of the crockpot between the images
as well as the headache inducing this
personally I get a headache from 3d
vision one no headache 3d vision to last
but not least we've got a gaming machine
over here that apparently antec got
their little paws on this one too
because it's all intact out as well as
they see stuff so this is one of their
director you see you two cards asus is
actually one of the few vendors that
does triple slot graphics cards now
while this may not be ideal for users
who are running SLI especially if you
want like 3-way SLI or through the
crossfire because they won't all fit in
a board it is ideal if you're running a
single part because it means that you
got that much more metal strap to your
card keeping it cool so if you can see
from the bottom okay you know what I
can't see from the bottom this guy's
actually got two cooling fans Milton and
the rest of the system is pretty neat
too this is a really neat power supply
there aren't many 80 plus platinum power
supplies and not many low wattage ones
so what you'll discover is that most
power supplies peak at around fifty to
sixty percent load in terms of their
efficiency that's where they're going to
hit their maximum efficiency
and with the highly efficient gaming
parts that we had these days like gtx
680 radeon HD 7970 as well as new Ivy
Bridge processors what we need in terms
of high-end power supplies he has low
wattage extremely efficient power
supplies in order to get the most out of
them Kingston also about their grubby
paws on his boots with some hyperx
memory going on in here as well as a
hyperx SSD welcome to the nvidia booth
nvidia i mean these guys are doing so
much amazing stuff these days not just
with geforce on the desktop but also
with pegre on the mobile side so for
their actually got you can use
these but personally i prefer the
concrete information they have a new
sous tablet powered by an nvidia tegra
chip that is outputting to here which
looks really good it looks very
impressive all that stuff but what is
even more impressive is the fact that
cutter move there we go if the fact that
they have this going on the full-size
1080p that TV right in front of me
you can play with your tablet you can
play with the remote controller whatever
you want we are experiencing HD gaming
at its finest in spite of the fact that
this device is thinner than a phone
which is pretty cool so let's keep
moving right along here we've got a
couple of other things including the
issues transformer prime so I've covered
this one in the past already this is
running the Tegra 3 processor which is a
five core processor it has four main
course and one auxiliary port for power
saving and you can check out my unboxing
on my Linus tech tips channel if you
want any more details on it Tegra 3
basically turns Android into the
experience that I thought it should have
been peg or two is fast especially for
things like gaming but in terms of the
overall snappiness and responsiveness of
the platform Tegra 3 really kicks it up
a notch remember Tegra 3 is a quad-core
effective versus two fours effective for
tegra 2 you've only got a couple pretty
neat gaming notebooks here 7676 70s and
six a key so these are for ms tiny sous
this and the side model is actually the
one that I'm more familiar with this
uses their custom steel series designed
by steelseries backlit keyboard as well
as their dynaudio on the solution both
of these are really a couple steps ahead
of the competition in terms of what
they're doing to make the tactile
experience of your notebook gaming
notebook excellent as well as the audio
experience now these are not for the
faint at heart these are thick notebooks
they're heavy however if you want the
ultimate gaming experience on the go
with a quad-core processor a high-end
nvidia graphics card then that's pretty
much what you're going to want to go
75 and this is the new v75 so this is a
brand-new design the g74 saw several
revisions of CPUs as well as GPUs go
into it before it looks like they have
finally redesigned this notebook I
actually haven't seen this one yet you
can see remnants of the original g74
design like the way the hinges are
position here however they've looks like
it completely redone the interior design
so they've got a great soft touch feel
here this is actually a bit rougher than
most soft touch which i think is a good
thing because it will keep it from
wearing out as quickly as most soft
touch finishes do in terms of i/o we've
also got an upgrade here we've got
blu-ray SD to USB 3 SuperSpeed ports and
on the other side we have a wide variety
of things actually we've got more
SuperSpeed USB two more of those we've
actually got HDMI gigabit ethernet as
well as what the heck is that with a SAP
thunderbolt
looks like it's wonderful correct me if
I'm wrong here guys but I think that's
Thunderbolt leave a comment under the
video if I'm wrong and coupled together
with the nvidia booth one of their board
partners decided to come to the tech
fair as well galaxy has got a be sleep
gaming machine going in here with one of
their custom non-reference video cards
that it looks like a gtx 670 GC with the
dual fan cooling solution so they've got
that running a 3d vision devil
oh no they don't have to be vision sorry
they have treaty vision stuff here but
they bought it running unigine heaven
just so you can see how absolutely
beastly it is also if you can't check
out the galaxy goop make sure you bug
them for one of these I've got one these
are these are dead GPUs from RMA's over
the years so these are older GPUs and
they cut them in plastic and it makes
for like a really cool little keychain
finally they've got their lineup of
graphics cards unfortunately they don't
have the gtx 670 or 680 here because
they're rarer than hen's teeth however
as a show deal we do have the gtx 670
for 369 dot 99 that the galaxy reference
card which is pretty cool however
remember the gtx 670 and 680 are great
for surround gaming but so is the MDT
serious brown galaxy so they've got a 5
65 75 80 that are all capable of three
monitors surround gaming we actually did
an NCIX tech tips on that not that long
ago on the NCIX comm channel so thank
you for checking out our coverage on all
of the booths at the NCIX tech fair and
