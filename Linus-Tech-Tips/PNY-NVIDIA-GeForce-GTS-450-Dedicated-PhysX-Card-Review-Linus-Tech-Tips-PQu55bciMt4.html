thought it would be interesting to test
this card because it is coming in at
around a hundred US dollar price point I
wanted to test it as a dedicated PhysX
card so you can see I've got it
configured here right now with the GTX
480 and then the GTS 450 because this is
for physics and not for SLI there's no
need to install any SLI bridges or
anything like that and I am using a
motherboard that has two PCIe 16x slots
so that's all you really need for
physics now when you want to configure a
dedicated PhysX card all you do is go
into the Nvidia control panel okay so
you go into set physics configuration
and then you select your physics
processor so auto select would probably
select the 450 but I've gone ahead and
selected the 450 anyway you can see the
other options would be to run physics on
the 480 run it on the CPU which is low
or run it on the 450 so then all you do
is click apply and that's all there is
to it so you can see here it says yeah
this X is running here and then the
display is running here so that's fairly
straightforward so what I'm going to do
is I'll do up a little graph with some
benchmark results this is the same test
bench I used for my GTS 450 review as
well as my GTS 450 SLI review review and
so I'm just going to go ahead and
compare the 480 numbers I got without a
dedicated PhysX card so while I was
running physics on the on the 480 itself
with adding the 450 to take a little bit
of the load off it
well I think based on the numbers the
conclusion for this video is quite
simple because you can see that a GTX
480 is a little over $500 after rebate
I'm the NCIX site and then a GTS 450 is
gonna run you about 120 $9.99 so you're
adding about 25% more cost to your setup
by adding a GTS 450 on top of the GTX
480 that in theory you already own but
you also get about on average a twenty
four point five percent improvement in
performance so it's not actually very
often on premium parts that you can pay
an extra dollar to get an extra
proportional amount of performance like
usually you see a point of diminishing
returns where you're spending you know
twice as much but you're only getting
you know one point five times the amount
of performance so it's actually a pretty
good value from that perspective but the
drawback is that out of all of the games
that I have here on my Steam account to
do to do to do to do to do to do to do
to do I only have like two that support
PhysX so it's one of those situations
where yes as a best-case scenario
a dedicated GTS 450 looks like a great
value if you play games that are going
to take advantage of it but if you don't
play physics enabled games then you'd
probably be better off saving your
pennies to grab another 480 to run in
SLI or finding some other way to
increase the performance of your system
so thanks for checking out my little
mini review on using the GTS 450 as a
dedicated PhysX processor</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
