of AMD presentations and what do I have
to show for it well we know it'll be
available starting 2:22 2017 which is
today and that performance will be
competitive with Intel's Core i7 lineup
but as we've been saying for so long
that means nothing if it's priced the
same so is it well as it stands today
AMD Rison looks poised to deliver
top-shelf performance and do so at an
incredibly disruptive price so let's
have a closer look
so we'll start by talking about the
lineup all the general stuff we confirm
back at CES is still true dual channel
memory overclockable across the board
assuming you've got a motherboard
chipset that supports it and 24 PCIe
lanes but we have a ton more details now
so at the top of the product stack is
the Rison 7 1800 x this is an 8 core 16
thread processor ok that we knew before
but now we know clock speeds it runs at
3.6 to 4 gigahertz though it'll actually
boost up to 4.1 with what they're
calling XFR or extended frequency range
assuming you've got the cooling horses
for it and it is coming in at a tiny
well okay it's still expensive but $4.99
AMD is positioning this a 95 watt $500
part up against intel's 130 watt $1,000
6900 k though as usual the
top-of-the-line part isn't necessarily
the most compelling and things get even
more interesting as we work our way down
the stack so behind me here is the 1700
X it still gets the x4 like X Factor so
it's a 95 watt part you should expect
better overclocking out of it compared
to a non X part and it still features
their extended frequency range so it
runs from three point four to three
point eight or three point nine with
appropriate cooling it's still got eight
cores it still got 16 threads and it
does all of this
priced at 399 which puts it competitive
with the 6800 K which is actually the
demo that they have behind us before we
do the demos we've got to introduce the
good member of this good better best
product stack this is the risin 7 1700
this guy is a little bit unique you
still get a coarse you still get 16
threads but now we're talking
significantly lower clock speeds
gigahertz base up to 3.7 gigahertz boost
and you get a significantly lower TDP 65
watts making this the lowest rated eight
core desktop processor on the market and
you will be doing this at a slightly
lower price
3:29 compared to a 7700 K so that would
be a quad core a thread processor that
it's going up again but come on line is
enough spreadsheets show us show us so
they gave us access to their Cinebench
demo unsupervised which was unwise of
them let's go ahead and run that while I
explain what's going on behind me so we
have a rise in seven 1800 X remember
that's the top of the line 1 499 with 16
gigs of RAM on some validation board
then over on the other side they've got
the hardware right here we can see it
we've got a 69 hundred K running with 32
gigs of corsair dominator platinum on an
asus rog board so they really couldn't
give it much more of an advantage and
then we're running Cinebench with
multi-threading enabled and the results
are in
so right here here's the 69 hundred K
actually see okay nothing's disabled
1479 and over here is the Rison 7z 3601
d and it has an engineering example but
whatever was Verizon seven 1800 X 1600
marks at half the price now obviously
this isn't the whole story when it comes
to CPU performance but it is definitely
an impressive demo though not as
impressive as this one I'm going to
press this big red button which has been
beckoning at me since I pressed it five
minutes ago ooh and I'm starting what
Andy is calling their mega tasking demo
which is a combination of blender and
handbrake designed to test the
multitasking all of these CPUs although
I believe mega tasking was like an AMD
TM thing that they were using back when
they were marketing I think it was try
cores or six cores or something like
that against intel's quad cores and dual
course anyway all of that tension has
at this point the point of the demo is
that we are timing how long it takes to
run this octane demo and this hand
braking code that you can see here is
running in the background all needs to
systems so they've put the 1700 X
remember this is the 399 8 core 16
thread up against Intel's Core i7 6800 K
once again the systems are similar
though AMD has for whatever reason
kneecaps themselves with 16 gigs of DDR
4 vs. Intel's 32 gigs of DDR 4 and now I
just have an awful lot of time to kill
so I will use this opportunity to talk
about how they have a lot of cool
systems here on display from all of
their partners this could be one of the
most complete AMD ecosystem launches
that that we have ever seen I think
they're saying something along the lines
of 82 motherboards available at launch
with more to come and I think it was 18
system integrators that are going to
have systems ready to go at launch it
seems like there's a lot of confidence
in the a m4 platform while the a and
these systems done I think we could just
like time lapse through this so people
know we aren't faking it there we go
okay so ninety 1.6 seconds versus a
hundred and twelve point one seconds I
mean none of this should be that
surprising from a pure performance
numbers standpoint I mean we're looking
at an eight core 16 thread processor
versus a six core 12 thread processor
but Andy's not designing this test to be
fair in terms of core count to core
count they're designing it around
pricing this chip on the right costs
less than this chip on the left really
yeah way old you were in the same
presentation I was leading us finally to
what may be the most disruptive skew of
all the 1700s so this one is as I said
before 329 putting it around the same
price as a 7700 K and you can see right
here they've got two general systems
running again side by side with a risin
seven 1708 core and a core i7 7700 k and
they're playing dota 2 while streaming
using OBS at the same settings they
really let us get a lot closer to the
demos here so we're able to validate all
of the stuff ourselves and demonstrating
how and I had been asking for this for
many generations why is the mainstream
still limited to quad core so they're
showing us how more cores can benefit a
multi-threaded workload even for gamers
so the core i7 7700 case screen drops
frames while the 1700 stream does not
this last demo battlefield 1 at 4k is
actually one we've seen before sort of
we've had some of the blanks filled in
this time so we already knew that
Rison unnamed was up against the 6800 k
with ddr4 memory and dual Titan XPS and
sli but what we didn't know was exactly
what that risin ship was or what speed
it was running at so now we know it is
actually their lowest tier risers have
been 1700 that's the 65 watt part and we
know that it runs at anywhere from 3
gigahertz to 3.7 gigahertz in this case
it's running at about 3.6 5 which might
tell us something interesting about the
granularity of the way that rise in
boost
anyway back to the game the other key
difference between then and now is that
AMD has their Boost Technology working
so while at CES brain rates were the
same to within a framer 3 now here we
are looking at exactly the same starting
scene driving our tank exactly the same
way and
Rison 7 1700 has a clear performance
advantage and a significant one now to
be fair AMD is picking their battle
somewhat here they could have put it up
against the much more similarly priced
7700 K which due to its higher frequency
is in most cases a better gaming CPU
then a core i7 6800 K but there's no
denying here that there's a compelling
value case to be made for this chip that
outperforms a 6800 K at about $100 less
so oh that's fine and good line is this
is the kind of CPU that we can have 4.8
billion transistors 2 kilometres of
signal wiring if we're not concerned
about putting graphics processors inside
them but you have left those the most
important part does it have RGB and the
answer is yes you are looking at an RGB
AMD stock cooler so thanks for watching
guys dislike this video you can hit that
button if you liked it hit the like
button get subscribed maybe consider
