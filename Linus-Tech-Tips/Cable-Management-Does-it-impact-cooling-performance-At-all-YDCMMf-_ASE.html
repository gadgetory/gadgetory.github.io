we were here testing something I believe
it was
how many case fans do you need and in
what position today we're going to be
doing another cooling investigation
video this one is going to be based on
cable management so we're going to look
into how much it actually affects your
cooling now there's a little bit of a
problem here which is where most cases
these days are actually pretty damn good
and have a lot of space behind the
motherboard and have like very clear
ways that you're supposed to route the
cables which isn't in places that would
affect the cooling so you're probably
fine but this is more of an
investigation as a whole sometimes
you'll see comments online where someone
will be like ah your cooling is going to
be terrible because you left a few
cables going in front of those fans so
we're going to check that out I don't
know the answer yet let's test
everything live
intel brings ddr4 to the mainstream with
their new core i7 6700 K and Core i5
6600 K processors check out the link in
the video description to learn more
ok so test one is going to be well
pretty good in terms of cable management
like this should be our benchmark for
clean cable management it's not the best
that has ever been done but it's at the
point where I think it's not going to
affect the cooling in any way so this is
pretty bare in terms of setup for
cooling we have a hyper 212 Evo finally
I'm not putting in a t4 and pretending
it's a 212 Evo thank you at Matt Grimes
5:00 on Twitter for sending this to me
by the way he mailed it to me directly
because he's tired of me complaining
about not having one so there's one fan
on there there's one 140 millimeter fan
in the front there's a 140 millimeter
fan in the back and there's two 120
millimeter fans in the top so this will
be our base benchmark for how this
computer is able to perform with pretty
good cable management will we will then
record its numbers and then I'll start
messing with the cables more and making
it Messier and Messier and just see how
far the rabbit hole goes so I've got the
case all closed up and now I'm doing
some testing so this is going to be run
for about 10 minutes total I'm running
per mark on the GPU and recording
temperatures of the GPU using msi
afterburner and then I'm doing a system
stability test with I 264 in order to
push the CPU so this should feed
everything up and get us to a relatively
hopefully high number although this
isn't a particularly hot graphics card
and the hyper 212 Evo is probably going
to do fine because nothing's actually
overclocked and then I will start
throwing more cables in there and
messing around okay so results of the
first tests are in again this is more
just a benchmark for the rest of the
benchmarks this is where like okay
there's no real cable obstructions going
on so our CPU is at about 50 degrees and
our GPU is at about 82 degrees so we're
going to document that make the cables a
little bit worse and move on okay so
I've added some cables I haven't added
an insane amount of cable
I have three big thick ones going across
the front I have one going kind of
through the middle and then I have one
placed as a pseudo not very well-managed
8-pin going like across over the power
supply by the back of the CPU cooler and
then up to where the eight pin placement
would be I don't expect this is going to
affect much but I haven't tried it yet
so let's figure it out okay so this
one's good to go well okay let's be
clear if you're building your own system
don't leave your cable management that
crappy but it's good to go for this test
for what I need it to do right now so
walking over to this screen I'm now
going to set the test back up so yet
again per mark for the GPU stress test
and then starting i-264
for the CPU another 10 minutes will
record the numbers and see how it did
see if it actually affected anything I'm
kind of thinking it won't or at least
not very much so that did absolutely
nothing 50 degrees on the CPU still 82
degrees on the GPU we're gonna have to
make this cable management a lot worse
that's going to be the next step I'm
gonna add like maybe most of this and
we'll see what happens
side panels on fur mark is set up I 264
is already running this test is a go I
know I've said this a few times already
but if this doesn't produce a result
there's probably not a ton that I can
even do to be completely honest and one
of the results from this video might be
if you have a standard kind of Tower the
cable management probably isn't that
important if you have something like a
no 202 or you have that bomb that I
built for the fallout build check that
video it up here then it probably
matters because if you're completely
blocking off all of the inputs that'll
be an issue but on a big case like this
there's enough just open areas that the
air is probably going to flow but who
knows we'll see you soon
ten minute test okay so no change at all
CPUs at fifty graphics cards at 82 so
yeah seems like if you have a mid tower
you're probably fine in terms of cable
management so we're just gonna
some fun I'm going to put a Snoopy in
there at which t-shirt a roll of tape
and iron and a Santa hat and maybe
that'll do something God we're going to
put all this stuff look now if your
cable management is so bad that you put
a Snoopy of Santa hat and iron and a
twitch t-shirt in your case we'll see
how much that will affect your airflow
system stability oh I forgot the tape
it's okay while the tests are running
I'm going to add the last part and I
forgot to add which was the roll of tape
I'm sure Linus is totally okay with all
the things I'm doing right now
nice I don't know where I can put it
that's probably fun that's okay that's
probably okay now we're rocking roll a
tape Snoopy iron santahat twitch t-shirt
let's do this
tests are currently running let's see
how they're going the CPU is currently
at 50 degrees and the GPU is currently
at 74
what the hell what okay okay so it's
actually doing fine right now which is
really concerning I guess we're going to
leave it for 10 minutes and then we'll
be back 50 degrees on the CPU 82 degrees
on the GPU I put a shirt a Santa hat a
Snoopy and iron and a giant roll of tape
along with every single cable that came
with a 1200 I into a case and it didn't
affect anything next up is boxes I'm
gonna take all this stuff out maybe put
some of it back in but use a lot of
solid boxes to try to completely block
off air flow pathways I want some
numbers to go up okay so we use the box
for the CPU cooler and we use boxes for
a bunch of water coolers there's one
under here our water blocks there's one
under here there's one to support that
and keep it where it is there's one
blocking the top fans there's one
blocking the black back fans so
basically every single fan has a box
currently trying to stop it from being
able to work properly except for I guess
this one there now there's a Santa hat
screwing with that one now we've done
all of this I'm going to put the case
panel but wait hold up hold up hold up
you move that out of the way all right
I'm going to put the case panel back on
I'm going to close this up I'm already
running the tests
I don't even stop them because nothing's
changed this whole freaking time so
we're currently running fur mark and
currently running itis
sixty-four I'm going to come over here
and see if there's been any immediate
changes the GPU has not increased in
temperature to bite despite having a
shirt shoved into it and a box under it
but it looks like we have a slight
increase in CPU temperatures oh good
I'll check back in ten minutes we did it
by adding four boxes for water blocks
one box for a hyper 212 Evo a t-shirt
and a Santa hat effectively putting crap
directly in front of every single fan
there is we have gotten the CPU to about
77 degrees and we've gotten the GPU to
86 degrees done so yes in the end it
took four boxes for water blocks it took
one box for a CPU cooler it took a
t-shirt a Santa hat and all of these
cables in addition to the cables that
were already inside which totals a pile
that looks something like this
placed into the computer in addition to
the required components to heat it up so
your bad cable management in your mid
tower it's probably fine this didn't
include tests for things like really
really small cases or very specific
builds like the bomb we have or
something like a no 202 or like an RV
zero one Silverstone but yeah it's
probably fine for keel measurements bad
but like I don't know how to word this
because don't just use that as an excuse
to have bad fuel management we don't
want ugly computers it's not a good idea
don't post a build log on the forum go
like lol Luke told me it was okay to
have terrible cable management because
it's not gonna increase my thermals very
much just do it properly everything will
be a fine a pacer is giving away 5 a
pacer a s 330 Panther 240 gigabyte SSDs
for a chance to win check out the link
in the video description down below on
the Linus tech tips forum also they'd
like me to call out their Knox ddr4
so-dimm memory design for gaming
enthusiast graphics designers and
business users their energy-efficient
zooming 1.2 volts and can go up to 64
gigabytes in their total kit capacity
also they want me to call it the AS 720
SSD its dual interface so you use it
internally or externally it's a 120
gigabytes or 240 gigabytes that's USB
type-c or SATA internally if you want to
do it that way thanks for watching this
video didn't really come out as I
expected and I don't think the
conclusion or what I had to do to get to
the conclusion was necessarily what
anyone expected but I hope you liked
watching consider supporting like the
video if you liked it dislike if you
disliked it get subscribed consider
supporting us through Amazon he's going
to affiliate code buy an awesome t-shirt
or sweater wherever I ended up putting
that and yeah we have other videos if
you want to see the previous video which
was how many case fans do you need click
that it's up there I'll see you next
