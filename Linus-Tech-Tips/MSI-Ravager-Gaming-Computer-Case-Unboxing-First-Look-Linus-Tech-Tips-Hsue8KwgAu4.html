ravaged or unboxing this is a case from
msi which is something that you might
not be accustomed to seeing more along
the lines of like motherboards and
graphics cards and like even networking
gear and stuff like that but never cases
before so we see a few different
features outlined on the front of the
case one is super speed USB 3.2 lyst
drive bay design solid-state drive
support three year warranty advanced
thermal design custom lacerated imprint
so that's kind of like a cool like claw
like effect going on over here
protecting your vital gear I don't know
about you guys but when it comes to my
vital gear I would not put it anywhere
near something called a Ravager just
throwing that out there however I pretty
sure what they mean is computer gear
which is probably fun okay moving right
along custom lacerated imprint and
advanced thermal design includes two
high-quality fans cable camouflage
system so cable routing ok removable
three and a half inch red big cages full
size vga cards part up to three hundred
and ten millimeters screwless easy
snapping a hard drive tray okay to the
out supports two and a half inch as well
tool is five and a quarter water-cooling
ready although this is very debatable i
personally don't believe these grommets
make it water cooling ready i'd rather
see spacing for our natively mounted
radiator extra spacing for cable
management and pre-installed with 120
millimeter front blue LED fan with dust
filter let's go ahead and open this bad
boy shall we commenting breaking some
seals cuz that's what we do
hey soft foam as you guys may or may not
know if you've been watching my channel
for a little while I prefer soft foam to
hard foam because it stands up against
multiple impacts better than heart phone
this is however quite thin soft foam in
some places considering the size and
weight of a fully load system but I
guess I'm gonna have to compromise on
this particular one alright there we
have the rubbed raksha it looks not bad
this looks better in person than it does
in pictures i mean d ouch shocked me and
I mean the the laceration like tattoo
thing that they got going on here so
this is a fairly high quality paint that
they're using it's not something that's
just like a sticker that's gonna come
off this is painted right on it looks
now actually what's kind of nice and not
just the overall color scheme of the
case so you can see the internals are
using msi branded fans as well as blue
pci slot covers a blue motherboard back
plate as well as more tattoos over here
on the other side and i got an
interceptor series ravager this one
looks like it's a sticker but it's no no
it's not it's not Matt's actually
painted right on there that looks really
sharp we've got support for actually no
let's finish with the tattoos and then
we'll move on okay so last set of
tattoos right here 35 and a quarter inch
Bay's big old power button as well as an
LED at the front we've got our intakes
here at the front as well and let's move
around to the rest of the outside so
front USB 2.0 phone front USB 3.0 sets
which and hard drive indicator LED we've
got more fangirls up here we're going to
open it up to find out exactly what's
inside there on this side we've got
support for up to 2 140 millimeter fans
all of this spacing is also compatible
with 2 120 millimeter fans on the back
we find another 120 millimeter fan or a
92 millimeter fan whichever you prefer
and 7 pci slots so this is going to fit
standard ATX boards or micro ATX ports
or mini ITX boards but not XL 80 exports
to filter in takes on the bottom one of
these
your power supply one of these is for an
additional 120 millimeter fan now let's
go ahead and use the thumb screws here
to open up the case well look at that
they're not too tight from the factory a
lot of the time these thumb screws are
so tight at the factory that I can't get
them off with my fingers and I have to
actually use a screwdriver heaven forbid
hey mr. Cruz driver in this day and age
everything should be tulus actually no
I'm not sure that I'm not much of a
tool-less guy myself I prefer things
that are securely mounted to things that
are too low so if you can securely not
something to lessly that's pretty good
too not too much flex on the panel
although this isn't exactly a premium
case by any stretch of the imagination
and the price tag would dictate that
it's that it's not i mean when i say
premium case i mean like it's not you
know $300 case like a corsair 800d where
my expectation would be that it's meal
built out of tank armor but um Jeff
moving on lips that filter came off go
ahead and throw that filter back in
there so these filters are basically
just mounted with little little clips
actually here you can have a look so
they're mounted with little clips
they're effective if not the most you
know elegant possible solution but
they're easy to clean not made of metal
so they're not going to like rust or
anything after you clean them I've
actually run into that very recently
that's why I brought it out like not
impressed so here we are on the inside
okay so here's our hard drive sled so
you can see the two and a half inch
mounting holes as well as the three and
a half inch mounting holes so the three
and a half inch our tool this however
you will need tools for two and a half
inch drives you can also see that these
are completely removable groups
hypothetical there you go these are
completely removable and also to Lestat
oh so not only could you mount a 310
millimeter graphics card you could mount
like 400 plus millimeter graphics card
and this also gives you away to install
an additional 120 millimeter fan without
too much muss or fuss so you can see
there's one installed right there that's
a blue LED fan can you see that he says
so so okay well it's in there enough to
trust me on this one and then there's
another blue and black 120 millimeter
fan at the back of the case this one
with MSI branding
so this guy doesn't come out this one's
riveted in however you'll probably need
at least a few hard drives at any rate
so this is your optical drive mounting
basically you just hums this work push
oh cool there you go so they pop out or
they pop in good stuff Wells is there to
really say here let's have a look at the
internal connectors so nothing really
out of the ordinary here we've got power
as well as USB 3 USB 2 and front HD
audio we've got your usual internal
connectors for you know your power
switch your reset switched and your
various LEDs that you're going to need I
prefer if these are black but it's not
the end of the world because you do have
space for managing your cables so
everything from your power supply it's
going to come through this one and
you'll be writing them out here here and
here is where you're a pin or not yeah
here too you could potentially put an
8-pin through there and wrote that to
your motherboard depending on the
positioning of the a pin you can also
route a bunch of stuff up through here
at the top let's have a look at the
spacing in the top here so you can do up
to 2 140 millimeter fans or 2 120
millimeter fans I would have preferred
to see just straight to buy 120 with
support for a radiator but it's not the
end of the world one way or the other I
didn't actually mention at any point
during this video that this is a bottom
mounted power supply you got rubber
mounts right here so it's not going to
scratch itself out on the bottom of the
case and in terms on the room for
routing cables behind actually that's
not bad so we've got enough room back
here to easily do a 24 pin cable without
warping out the other side of the case
from the back it doesn't really look
like there's anything in particular
going on I think that pretty much covers
it other than checking out what's in
here so hopefully there's like some bank
I Messiah customer survival pack I
guarantee I know who at msi came up with
that idea and I know he's going to watch
this video I'm looking at you your
initials r RK and that is hilarious okay
I also know who's responsible for these
dog tags oh that's cool okay so it comes
with some black zip ties happy to see
long zip ties because how many times
have you seen cases that come with those
little short supplies like this but
actually like aren't big enough to hold
anything so these are handy you've also
got ah yes they've built in lots of
space to use them so these helped a lot
when you're routing cables having all
these little loops on the back of the
motherboard tray allows you to keep
everything flat and keep everything
cabled really tightly whether it's data
cables that you're running down here or
power cables that you're running up to
various places so that is what those
included zip ties are for we also have
Oh meat okay these are Hannity we also
have a Phillips head to motherboard
standoff adapter so you put the
motherboard standoff in this side then
you screw it in with a Phillips head to
screw it into the back of the
motherboard tray got a bunch of look at
that nice little touches black screws
love to see that very nice and it comes
with a dog tag msi insists on the best
I've actually quite nice very thick cool
i'll put that with my other dog although
this one is customized see this one's
from nvidia gtx 590 squadron so now I
have MS I insist on the best to go with
that although the MSI one feels like
higher quality this one's kind of cheesy
so thank you for checking out my
