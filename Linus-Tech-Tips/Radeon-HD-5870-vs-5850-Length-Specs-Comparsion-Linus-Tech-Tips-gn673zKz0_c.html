realized is that I didn't really go into
enough depth about what are the
differences between these two cards so
first let's talk about the physical
differences okay the most obvious one is
the difference in length so we're gonna
measure the 5870 from the very edge of
the PCI bracket here to the end of the
card is 11 oh it's like 11 and 1/8 of an
inch and then for the 5850 the same
measurement is only 9 and hold just a
hair over 1/2 so it's about 9 and you
know 5/8 of an inch okay but something
that you have to factor in is that
you're gonna need almost another inch or
so maybe 3/4 of an inch for the PCI
Express connector so it actually is more
like more like 10 and a half so you're
only looking at about a 1 inch
difference between these 2 cards when
they're installed in your case now they
both support DirectX 11 and they both
support eye Finity with up to 3 monitors
one DisplayPort and 2 other digital
displays now in terms of the overall
spec I'm gonna cheat a little bit here
and I'm gonna look at the chart on
hardware canucks because it's very very
useful
so the 5870 is clocked at 850 megahertz
on the GPU core and the 5850 is clocked
at 725 the 5870 has faster memory at 4.8
gigahertz whereas the 5850 is clocked at
4000 so just four gigahertz there are a
couple other differences for example the
stream processors are done from 1600
stream processors to 1440 and then
you're also a little bit reduced on the
ro Peas okay so sorry the texture units
the RO peas are the same so what that
means is that with the 5850 based on all
the benchmarks I've seen I haven't had a
chance to test it yet you're looking at
about 10 to 15% slower but at a
significant cost reduction so thank you
for checking out my differences between
the 5870 and the 5850 video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
