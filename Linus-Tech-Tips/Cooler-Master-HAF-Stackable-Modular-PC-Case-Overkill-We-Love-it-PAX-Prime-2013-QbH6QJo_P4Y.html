brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries welcome to the
Coolermaster booth here at pax 2013
they've got a ton of stuff on demo but
it's all kind of one thing this is the
half stacker system and this is what
them I mean this is the most monstrous
computer I think I've seen here at the
show how do you configure one of these
you don't get the whole thing in one box
so you start with a half 9:35 so to be
clear a half 9:35 is kind of a normal
sort of half looking case so it's an ATX
case it supports an ATX motherboard has
got your usual sort of eight expansion
slots and then it has a half 9/15 which
is actually available as a standalone
purchase with either a rear-mounted
power supply or a front-mounted power
supply so it comes with a half 9-15
stacked on top of it they've got little
guide rails so you can actually stack
them on top of well the 9:35 unit that
comes preassembled or you can even buy
multiple 915 s on your own and stack
them together as many times as you
wanted so you can push on there we go
that one you can open up the second one
and it's a standalone MITx case so you
can either have the power supply mounted
in the front by default or in the rear
that's the R SKU and the advantage of
the front mounted power supplies that it
gives you more room for tall tower
coolers where the ITX motherboard would
be or if you don't really care about
front mounted power supply rear mounted
power supply or putting a motherboard in
it at all you can use it as strictly a
storage box so this one right here has
everything pulled out of it with the
stacker system they are trying to avoid
using rivets pretty much entirely and
focus on allowing them to screw together
so you're actually able to pull out all
the mounts for everything and throw nine
hard drives in there hey maybe you don't
want to go that route maybe you want to
go completely different route use it as
a rad box that's where the half nine
forty five comes in so to be clear you
buy a half nine thirty five which has a
regular sort of normal Tower with a nine
fifteen on it you can buy additional
nine 15s you buy an additional
fifteen for your 9:35 you have a 945 and
the way this one's configured with nice
tight screws so I can't open it up and
show you guys if there's actually two
three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiators in the bottom two three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiators
in the top also in the bottom is a pump
and fan controller and all of that is
supporting one beastly water-cooled
system here so there's a 4770k 16 gigs
of dual channel ram from kingston full
liquid cooling from coolants including
two gtx 690 so those are running in Quad
SLI and of course if you have all that
radiator surface area for cooling you're
going to be able to I'm gonna be nice
and I'm not going to touch the back of
their cards but I will tell you they are
definitely running extremely cool so
we're expecting this to be available on
shelves October 15th or so because I
mean you never know these aren't even
finished samples right here but the last
thing I wanted to point out is that the
way that they are going to align is
going to allow you to see that this with
the tubing here or the wiring is going
to give you so much flexibility you want
your power supply in the bottom unit go
for it
you want your radiators in the bottom
unit you need to pass your cables and
your tubes in between them go for it
one other thing I wanted to show off
since we're here at the booth anyway is
they're cherry MX key switch sampler so
it comes with reds greens clears blues
Browns and blacks it costs fifteen bucks
on their store twenty-five twenty-five
bucks on fifteen on the store and you
get a fifteen dollar credit from the CM
storm store to buy a mechanical keyboard
after you buy it so effectively you get
it for free if you're committed to
getting a mechanical keyboard and you
really want to try them out ahead of
time so that pretty much wraps it up for
this booth guys remember our trip to the
show is powered this year by Western
Digital Intel and SteelSeries huge
thanks to you guys for allowing us to be
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
