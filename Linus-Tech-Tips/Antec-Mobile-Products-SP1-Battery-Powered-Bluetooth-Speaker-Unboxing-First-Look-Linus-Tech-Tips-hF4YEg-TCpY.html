the am p that is amp antec mobile
products sp1 so the reason i have a
couple jam box is my jawbone here we'll
leave those aside for later is because
this is sort of a similar style of
device so a couple things stream digital
media wirelessly from booth
bluetooth-enabled devices okay chat to
the built-in microphone lets you pick up
and place calls listen to your favorite
song watch a movie or play games with
big sound okay up to 10 hours of
playback time the sp1 is always ready
when you are and has a range of up to 10
meters with bluetooth or you can also
use the green a half millimeter cable so
let's go ahead and slice open the
packaging here is a very nice packaging
by the way so am p amp antec mobile
products is an a product line from antec
that is all about mobile products and
not cases and not power supplies but
rather different stuff so the first
thing you find inside is a sexy ribbon
three-and-a-half millimeter cable okay
so that's just a three and a half mil
two three and a half mil so you use that
from like say for example your phone to
your speaker okay so we'll put that
aside for now right there then we've
also got mmm ribbon USB charging cable
so there's a microUSB to USB connector
with sort of ribbon cable that's awesome
okay so put that aside for now as well
now we can remove the bottom piece here
and remove the amp sp1 from the
packaging so something probably about
lauren teen whatnot and then something
else here which is a user's manual and
it's very very very short which makes
sense okay so this is a device itself it
has a very sort of that's kind of a
strange shape to it so it's not quite
square you can see there's a bit of
curvature here and here moving it sort
of our like um I don't know different
shape it's also yeah it's let you see
again you from the side you can see it's
not quite square there either so it's
more of a what are they called trapezoid
trapezoid
it from the side here you've got just
your usual plus minus which is an all
likelihood volume and then this is would
be for answering or hanging up calls
there's the built-in microphone and then
you've got kind of a speaker grill that
has a fabric behind it that looks very
nice as well so I'm not sure which way
you put it down you put it down this
road you put it down probably okay this
way but then it sort of that doesn't
really rock it all okay on this side you
find all of your inputs and outputs
there's your on/off switch which seems
to have a little plastic cover on it
that I can't ah there we go sort of
coming off now you've got your three and
a half mil headphone jack and you're
charging port and on the other side you
don't find a whole lot so the only real
way to evaluate something like this is
to take it put it next to the thing that
it's sort of um competing with and find
out which one sounds better so the
answer of which way it's oriented was
answered pretty the answer of the
question of which way to orient it was
answered pretty quickly you can either
put it down like this or up like this
because it's only the narrow side this
side it doesn't really have any sound
coming out of it so we're going to put
it like this it didn't come with a
charge out of the box so we're just
using a mobile USB battery so we'll go
ahead and crank
initial impressions well sorry initial
impressions are very very positive
compared to jam box which when you crank
up all the way sounds sort of brutal so
we'll go ahead and turn that on for you
guys here we go oh let's not charged
either awesome okay hold on let's see if
this one is I don't use them off and so
it sort of makes sense that they aren't
charged but we'll go ahead and do this
and then we will do this and then we'll
do this BAM alright so let's turn this
one up all the way and you guys can kind
of hear the contrast yes you can try
anything so gentle box isn't loud and
when we do actually get it cranked out
it just sort of it gets very distortion
e whereas the sp1 actually doesn't
distort pretty much at all even at full
volume so yeah there you go sp1 portable
bluetooth speaker doodad to chargeable
