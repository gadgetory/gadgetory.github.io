gaming officer and we are going to be
talking about the flux in-ear and the
flux in-ear pro we're going to start
with the pro though welcome to Linus
tech tips at CES 2013 our trip to the
show this year is powered by corsair
maker of quality pc components and
peripherals our trusted storage partner
is seagate technology and our trusted
networking partner is innocence so i
don't know if you guys are familiar with
steelseries but they make a couple of
you know peripherals and audio products
and basically you know if you have a
chief gaming officer on your staff then
I'd say you're sort of a gaming oriented
company what makes these optimal for
gamers or fir let's say not gamers and
it's a balance amateur headset which
means that it's practically distortion
for it it has a really really clear
soundscape for a first person shooter
where you want to have like special
sound and awareness it's super super
good and what makes them very unique
also is that doing our development of
these when we try to sort of like make a
really good product we realized one
thing which was at all in use I really
designed to look pretty and here's an
example yeah these look really pretty
they don't sound great and check out the
way that this is ripped yeah out of here
and we found that in all our testing
actually that they look very very pretty
they're not necessarily like really nice
and comfortable we bought more than 100
different in use we tested them and we
couldn't find that or the favorite
internally which was like an eye opener
so we we actually said looking at
hearing aid since that the hearing aid
is a medical device that's designed to
be in your year and be comfortable all
day right so we designed these after
hearing aids where you just put them in
and you can feel immediately when
they've when they plug in and when
they're comfortable and that's something
you can wear for hours and hours
and it's true you guys you actually can
I now diesel where's uh he'd easily
where's earbuds that do go over and
around his ear and I always kind of
thought that was a little bit weird I've
never actually tried it before it feels
a little weird at first but you were
saying that you actually use this
running for running now yeah um okay
another thing that's cool they come with
an 8-pin connector system here so for a
pc put this in a duplex and for an
iphone or a template or mank it comes
with this it's very easy to use oh
that's awesome yeah that's something we
will be touching a lot more in the
future okay so here should we do like a
non tangled sort of demo here you can do
that sure okay so I'm gonna put it in my
pocket now I've seen a fair number of
non tangled cords I've even seen braided
non tangled cords that are just around
good good it doesn't work you need a
ribbon cable if you want to have an aunt
angle design so you take this out of
your ear it looks out of your ear well
no you take it out of your pocket it's
gonna look like this they're actually
using a slightly wider ribbon cable that
is a little bit thicker as well then
even ribbon non tangled cables that I've
seen in the past this I believe is what
helps to contribute to making it even
more non tangle than what you would
normally see which is sort of I mean
even this this is a non tangle at all so
yeah there you go so tell us about the
pricing of the flux in-ear prone what's
it competing against I think it's
competing against any balanced armature
headset the price of three hundred and
twenty nine dollars we're just
incredibly aggressively priced I think
it's the best sounding yes it under two
hundred dollars okay so there you go
guys as you know i recommend nothing but
steel series seven H's to anyone who
asks me about what headset to buy for
gaming what headset to buy for their
computer basically I think it's the best
sounding headphone under 150 180 dollars
pans down so if they've done the same
thing with the flux in-ear pro that's
great I actually haven't tested it yet
but I brought slick who is more of our
golden ear guy to tell us what do you
thinks about it first to go over
organelle mix and design all I kind of
stuff I usually do not like in your
headphones because they just don't fit
in my ears properly but these ones when
it went around you could really tell
they were designed to fit properly in
your ears you know it's my favorite
thing I should these ones I keep
bringing up these I don't really like
them but look how far they stick out of
your ear yeah how way did they are words
the other so what happens is anyone
there's any pressure on them it pulls
them out and there's that weight on your
ear canal sorry go ahead audio I can't
listen to music while running I guess my
headphones always follow so that's
actually fantastic audio quality was
great a lot of times with gaming stuff
you find that they just pound bass for
no absolute reason and you'll play
something that's like a classical song
but all yours were these had a really
really wide range but we're still able
to pound bass so that was really nice to
hear all right so tell us about the more
entry-level product this is the flux
in-ear yeah so these are the sign
differently okay did we lose our flux in
here they're here we go so you said
designed a little bit differently
they're based on different nights right
cross and have a look and they're
designed to fit into your ear the exit
basically go further into a year and it
is not as distortion-free SD balanced
amateur obviously there's also a
technology difference and but I would
also go on record and say that for $59
that's the best sound $49 that's the
best sounding case that you'll get
period and then because again you guys
are sort of gaming oriented company it
comes with those dual adapters as well
right no not this one not this one oh so
this is only for mobile only for mobile
but it does have a mic you can use it as
a headset yes no problem something to be
aware of guys is you can actually buy
adapters from your dual sockets to these
I think you can get them at a lot of
dollar stores so I wouldn't worry too
much about not having that one included
however I am really excited to try the
in Europe role I was busy shooting a
video about the keyboard and am I
missing out yeah okay i'm getting the
yes i'm missing out thank you very much
for doing this little interview and guys
i am very excited to see more in ear
products i do like the way they sound i
like the fact that you don't have to
wear a big bang and i love steelseries
audio products so there you go good work
thank you thanks for watching linus tech
