is no shortage of ways to transform your
screen into a video stream visible to
potentially millions of people around
the world for the mad ballers among us a
second PC dedicated to that task is the
undisputed king of performance and
quality but how did the rest of us get
our streams going without crossing them
up
AMD claims to have the best solution but
do they welcome to a new episode of
manufacturers say
Brow's privately and securely with
tunnel bear the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description
one of AMD's top marketing points is
that the 16 threads in their rise in
seven CPUs allow gamers to dedicate
ample CPU resources to both gaming and
video streaming coding without impacting
the performance of either since games
won't make use of all 16 threads and
neither will an encoder meanwhile one of
intel selling points for their consumer
level chips is their integrated graphics
processor and its ability to use Quick
Sync video technology to encode a video
stream without impacting the performance
of their CPU well that all sounds great
but with both of them claiming to
achieve the same objective by very
different means well surely one of
them's got to be better right well
predictably enough AMD says that their
way software encoding is superior and
the traditional wisdom would back them
up on this one the software based x264
encoder is well-known to offer higher
image quality and more flexibility in
its setup compared to other solutions
but until now if you cared about
performance you'd almost never use it
while gaming because its consumption of
system resources was pretty much
guaranteed to impact your gameplay
unless you were running an extreme
edition or something like that
but with more processing cores that rise
in sevens disposal it could be that
AMD's onto something meanwhile what are
the other guys doing different here
Intel's Quick Sync video and for that
matter
Nvidia's NV e and c &amp;amp; RT G's Radeon
video codec engine are all what are
known as dedicated hardware based
encoders which present an interesting
conundrum in the
eery you actually stand to lose
virtually no performance which is cool
but you're forced to use the optimized
settings that are baked into the
hardware meaning that you can't really
tune anything beyond their presets
besides simply increasing the raw
bitrate to improve quality
so finally back to the big questions how
much does the encoder matter for quality
is Twitch's new maximum of 6 megabits
per second enough that it won't really
matter anymore are any of these
solutions really able to untether you
from the second PC and let you stream
without impacting performance well we
touched on this from AMD's perspective
in our Rison 7 review which you can
check out here and we asked you guys at
that time if you wanted something more
in depth and since you did ask so nicely
your wish is our command we're going to
focus on two games for our testing first
ashes of the singularity's cpu benchmark
not because it's a hot game on twitch
right now but for technical reasons it
stresses the CPU and has a good mix of
slow-moving terrain with lots of small
fast-moving projectiles that are great
at introducing blocky artifacts during
encoding the second will be the for
honor benchmark with its sweeping
cameras and loads of special effects we
know again most people aren't streaming
these games but canned benches are much
more repeatable across our platforms and
both of these titles represent a
realistic gaming load that is more
demanding than today's popular eSports
titles for our encoders we've used
common twitch streaming bit rates and
resolutions for all of our comparisons
you'll note that 1080p 30 is technically
more data to cram into our lower bit
rates than 720p 60 but the higher frame
rate of 720p 60 should better highlight
motion artifacts in our encoders so any
CPU even one with onboard graph
can use x264 encoding but we observed in
our testing that not all are created
equal in this regard we found that AMD's
Rison 7 managed to hood hmm I just snuck
up on me
managed to avoid dropping frames
throughout our testing at a higher
quality preset than either of Team Blue
solutions in some cases even some of our
Hardware encoders needed lower presets
so to find out how these differences in
encoding settings affect real-world
image quality we captured a lossless
reference recording with our Blackmagic
intensity Pro and used it for comparison
so we can see some subtle differences
here
Rison manages to retain smaller details
that get smeared out on Team Blue at
their very fast and superfast settings
compared to rhizomes faster this not
only translates into better picture
quality overall but also contributes to
better quality when twitch then re
encodes it for its various quality
options moving on here we see our
hardware encoders at 1080 30p at 2500
kilobit per second alongside our Rison
x264 footage of the four x264 on Verizon
appears to be the least likely to lose
small projectiles in ashes of the
benchmark NV and C and quick sync don't
seem half bad here to be clear but they
do block up more often and lose finer
details when a lots going on at once
Artie G's AMF encoder on the other hand
sorry Radeon fans but huh
things get more interesting again at
720p 60 x264 holds up best once more
although the shimmering of compression
artifacts on the cobblestones as the
camera flies by is pretty noticeable but
not nearly as noticeable as it is with
the rest of our contestants NV NC is
again at the head of the hardware pack
looking decent but our quick say
and amf footage are both abysmal at
times blocking up so badly as to appear
as though they'd been recorded at 240p
instead of 720p
we'll keep our visual comparisons
rolling while we move on to performance
with x264 we see a respectable showing
from our risin 7 1800 X averaging about
a 5 to 10% performance penalty on the
faster and very fast presets over our
baseline reading on the 6900 K meanwhile
we get an average of a roughly 3 to 23
percent performance drop clearly a much
more varied result while our 7700 K
could get as high as a 36 percent hit
both of these ones on the superfast
preset AMD's high-speed Infiniti fabric
interconnect secret sauce for rise ins
video encoding wild gaming performance
looks like it's working so far our
hardware tests meanwhile show rise in
actually taking a wider hit with envy
EMC at roughly 5 to 15 percent on
average while our 6900 k managed a 3 to
10 percent variance and our 7700 k
ranged from 2 to 18%
RTGS amf encoder seemed to hit all of
our chips less with Rison taking our
roughly 7 to 8 percent performance hit
and sitting in between the other two
though as we've seen the AMF encoder is
also far from the highest quality for
streaming but we have one final encoder
one that we can't directly compare with
any other CPU and that's Intel's Quick
Sync video compared to the 7700 k's
baseline it caused a three to twelve
percent performance drop about in line
with the rest of our hardware encoder z'
so finally then lining all our encoders
up next to each other we can see that
actually rise in running x264 blows the
doors off every other
CPU and coder combination it has a tight
variation in its performance impact over
our baseline numbers and it handles a
higher quality CPU preset meaning that
when twitch Rhian codes you lose less
detail overall so taken together it
looks like AMD's marketing department
