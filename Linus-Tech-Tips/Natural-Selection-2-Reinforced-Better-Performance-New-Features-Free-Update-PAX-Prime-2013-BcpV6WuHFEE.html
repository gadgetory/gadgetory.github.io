brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries so we're here with Hugh
Jeremy who refuses to tell us his job
title and insists that they do not have
them but is extremely excited to talk to
you guys about the new expansion natural
selection reinforced so um okay I guess
let's start with a really difficult
question first and foremost what have
you done about the performance issues
Linus you ask the right questions first
it's a fact that when natural selection
to launch the performance wasn't quite
where it needed to be especially on
lower-end machines and on hiring
machines people would walk out of a game
of battlefield 3 with tanks exploding
and planes flying class and they go why
don't I get the same frame rate in
natural selection too well in natural
selection to reinforce we have addressed
this at the low level we've changed the
way that natural section 2 uses its
scripting language lure in such a way
that the frame rate is now a lot higher
and more consistent so not only are you
running it's a 60 instead of 40 but
you're not dipping down to 30 all the
time like used to happen guys there are
some great articles on PC perspective
about the whole frame latency or frame
rating or frame timing issue and it
really does affect the gaming experience
in a way that the aisle is the sheer
time it takes to draw each individual
frame does not so with that said you
guys okay so run smoothly on Windows but
you told me there were some other cool
stuff come on come on very cool stuff
you open up the options menu in natural
selection 2 now on Windows you might
notice an option to change between d3d11
d3d 9 and OpenGL and that's again why
would we be running OpenGL the reason is
that Linux uses OpenGL to draw graphics
in 3d games natural selection to
reinforce runs on Linux you can go to
the the lit the steam Linux store and by
natural selection tool around if you
already own it on windows it'll run on
Linux right now so you don't need to buy
a separate key that's fantastic now I'm
going to confess that I had a co-worker
his name's Ivan he's Russian he's a an
avid gamer hardcore guy and he was
telling me about natural selection
telling me it was the greatest thing
since the invention of the wheel and he
spent about 10 minutes explaining the
gameplay mechanic to me and I kind of by
the end of it I had kind of glazed over
and I was like wha
it didn't feel that accessible to
someone who doesn't know how the game
works 100% already what have you done
what have we done we've we released a
game that does have a lot of depth to it
the rewarding experiences that people
have in natural selection to being led
by a commander leading as the commander
having complex realtime strategy battles
cloaked in a first-person shooters shell
they come with time they come with
learning and when we initially release
the game the learning was too hard there
was no scripted single-player tutorial
there were a bunch of tutorial videos we
admit it they weren't good enough the
reviewers said so in natural selection
to reinforce there is now a full
single-player tutorial you can play
through it it is scripted will introduce
you to the basic game mechanics for both
a marine and an alien and the commander
now has a contextual help system during
play that will hint you what upgrades
are needed where you should place
buildings etc to ease you into the
process because as you say it's a deep
game there's a lot going on when you
take a real-time strategy game which is
what natural section 2 is and you plate
replace all those units on the ground
with real people you get a little bit of
complexity but is that complexity that
breeds rewarding gameplay and now that
we have these tutorial systems we hope
that game players more accessible now
we've managed to get this far without
actually talking about any of the
gameplay improvements that have been
made in reinforced um I mean it's great
for the techy audience that we happen to
have but if you had to you know want
them to buy the game what would you tell
them they're going to get with
reinforced well they're firstly going to
get everything it was in natural
selection 2 it's a free update so anyone
that owns and it's through gets
reinforced for free and if you buy an s2
now you get reinforced and gorgeous
which is our previous expansion some of
the headline features that have gone
into reinforced include biodome which
you might be able to see behind us right
now completely new art set and that's
important because all our previous maps
used variations of the refinery art set
biodome ism completely new look for
natural section 2 female marines are now
in you can select your sex in the menu
and that includes all the customers the
three different types of armors we've
added the reinforcement program which
allows you to play as a black skulk with
red spines and various other armor types
as well in there to voluntarily support
development of natural section 2 we have
added the tutorial system we've had a
Linux support we've added cluster
grenades nerve gas grenades pulse
grenades the onus can now use bone
shield which has been an ability that's
been requested for so long there's been
graphical improvements we can now rent a
gloss a lot better which is essential
for buy them because there's so many
glossy areas i'm going to run out of
breath right now there's a huge change
log on unknown worlds calm / ns2 now i
lost track when you said that I could
choose sex so the options are yes no and
the options are definitely male and
female was there a dog there is a
present everyone everyone's adding like
female soldiers and dogs well you gotta
kick you got to keep up to I'm gonna
keep doing this to him well firstly will
definitely admit that the addition of
the female marine was not held up for
technical reasons there's nothing in the
spark engine that stops you adding
former Marines at launch what stopped us
was budget and time so now that we've
got that we've managed to put her in and
that's very important to us with dogs we
do have a dog but it's not a new feature
it's been in there from the start the
skulk has four legs except instead of
pores it's got spikes that allowed to
stick to walls and ceilings the only
time it makes a barking noises when it
bites someone in the face fact the sound
designer by natural selection to Simon
kamikaze he's a genius and when he was
recording the sound for the scope biting
he was literally sitting under a dinner
with a microphone going oh that he's a
fact that's awesome so thank you very
much for taking the time to chat with us
guys this is Hugh and don't forget our
power ours trip to the show is powered
by Western Digital Intel and steel
series don't miss any of our coverage of
