simple password and their websites
database was dumped you can buy it for
five bucks only one of those four rumors
is true and even then only in a fairly
loose sense more on that later welcome
to an impromptu episode of honest
answers that I'm calling wTF is going on
over there I'll be addressing the abrupt
shift in branding of the at line is tech
Twitter handle the recent banning of our
Amazon Associates account and of course
the hack the AKG K 7 xx headphones are
back on mass drop check out my review of
them up here and check out the drop at
the link in the video description so on
June 14th 2016 Amazon sent me an email
warning me that my amazon associates
account was not in compliance with the
operating agreement specifically the
part where associates are not permitted
to disclose how their referral fees will
be used I was instructed to make any and
all necessary modifications to my site
and processes within five business days
and notify them when I was done one
small problem my call-out for Amazon was
baked into the tail end of nearly 500
Linus tech tips videos dating back a
couple of years with no way at least
what I was aware of to alter previously
uploaded YouTube videos my efforts to
reach anyone by phone or by email
basically resulted in a second email to
which there was no way for me to even
reply
three days later informing me that my
business model wasn't a good fit for the
program and that my account had been
terminated effective immediately long
story short I'm not revealing names so
they don't get flooded with requests to
help with Amazon Associates issues but
this right now is a huge shout-out to
some industry folks who helped me get in
touch giving me an opportunity to
discuss the situation and plead my case
over the phone on June 22nd you guys
Rock the result though was not as some
have speck
related a green light to reactivate our
account but rather an opportunity to
reapply for a new account which has been
approved so in summary our old
associates ID and all the tracked links
under our old non-compliant videos are
inactive though we are pursuing an
interesting method that we could use to
update those old videos and reactivate
the associated links under the new
tracking ID so we'll see how that goes
but in the meantime because as many of
you who watched how does Elam do make
money no the Amazon Associates Program
has been a significant source of our
revenue we are coming back strong
speaking of which Prime Day is coming up
so you might want to go shop on Amazon
or sign up for a Prime membership using
the link in our description let's move
on to the compromised at Linus tech
Twitter handle generally speaking we
don't acknowledge attacks on our persons
or business for what I'd hope are pretty
obvious reasons but in this case it's
part of a much larger problem that's
affecting other youtubers and even more
importantly could also affect you the
manner in which the Linus tech Twitter
handle and my personal Hotmail and Gmail
then by extension my domain name
registrar account were compromised had
almost nothing to do with poor security
practices on our part yes my registrar
login email account should not have been
a personal one that was just a legacy
thing from before I even registered a
corporate domain name and that has since
been rectified along with some other new
security measures that again I hope you
can understand this I won't be
discussing publicly but other than that
there was nothing I could have done to
prevent this an individual right now
it's not clear whether it was over the
phone or by actually walking into a
physical location committed identity
fraud and was able to convince Bell
Canada to activate a SIM card in my name
which deactivated my own SIM card and
began immediately forwarding all phone
calls and text messages to that
individuals phone my mother-in-law's
first reaction when I told her about
this was did they place any
long-distance phone calls different
generation right
so I explained to her and I guess in
recounting the story also you but it's
much more serious than that with access
to my incoming calls and texts this
person can break into any account where
theoretically SMS account verifcation
acts as a a pseudo physical
authentication factor if you want more
information about multi-factor
authentication check out this video and
in some cases it can even act as a
single authentication factor for lost
password requests now as a rule I don't
do YouTube drama go subscribe to h3h3
productions or something if you're into
that stuff
I'll stay focused on tech but even
inside my bubble I've managed to catch
wind a similar attacks being used on
boogie and leafy with the same group
claiming responsibility for stealing
Lilly Singh's account and a handful of
others so I felt the need to address it
fortunately for us even though I was in
the middle of an on location video shoot
picking blueberries of all things when
my cell phone service turned off which
also made it harder for me to notice the
army of loyal followers who were
messaging me to inform me of the problem
thank you very much guys Nick and Yvonne
great work to them to very quickly
figured out the method of attack
deactivated my mobile account
deactivated our Twitter account and
called me back into the office to start
locking everything down the hijackers
never got into the YouTube channels so
all they pretty much managed to do was
vandalize my Twitter and use our
registrar dashboard to redirect website
traffic from Linus tech tips comm and
incoming mail heading to the at Linus
Media Group comm domain both of which
were happening for under an hour and
probably are where the worries about our
forum users data comes from rest easy
this was a simple social engineering
exploit and they were nowhere near any
of our servers let alone harvesting any
data from them however even if this is a
social engineering trick and it has to
be executed on a one-by-one basis
because this method of attack has been
demonstrated to be so successful I feel
like it's important to recommend to our
viewers that they do a security audit
ensuring that their accounts do not have
a single point of entry including
through their phone and that they call a
provider to check who is authorized to
make changes to the account and what the
process is for validating that person's
identity those guys aren't going to
understand how serious this problem is
until it starts increasing their call
volumes and affecting their bottom lines
anyway make lemons out of lemonade right
since I had to reset my profile picture
anyhow I figured it was as good a time
as any to finally make the transition
the outline is tech Twitter handle
moving forward will be the official
Twitter for the Linus tech tips video
publication and I will be starting a new
personal Twitter account
Linus G Sebastian a similar transition
will likely occur on Instagram very
shortly the reason for this being that I
feel like I am under utilizing the huge
team of social media experts here at
Linus Media Group and that by having
everyone posting content and replies to
these accounts we can provide you guys
with much more behind the scenes more
timely updates and more sexy shots of
products and/or Dennis last order of
business congratulations to the tech
quickie team which throughout its
history has involved every single member
of the company but currently is mostly
the John and Dennis show with me and
Luke hosting and also thanks to all of
you for your support they just broke a
million subscribers making us double
gold channel super fund next right well
might take a while but it's gonna happen
well that's probably going to be a while
but in the meantime if you have to fix
any electronics ifixit.com is your go-to
place from there 19,000 free
step-by-step repair guides to their huge
inventory of replacement parts to their
tools with lifetime warranties I fix it
as got your repair needs covered we use
their stuff all the time but my go-to is
the pro Tech tool kit which has actually
been upgraded in the time that we have
been advertising for it and also since I
bought my first one over three years ago
so instead of 54
bit's it includes 64 bits you know sixty
four-bit am i right it's like better
more ram no there's no ram in it but
there's all kinds of stuff like their
redesign screwdriver their flex
extension there
ESD tweezers including a pair of reverse
tweezers their plastic opening tools
their suction cups the metal spudger is
the jimmy pride tool and you've got an
ESD bracelet that you can wear to make
sure you're not zapping the components
you're working at it's priced at $69
code which is linked in the video
description so that's code Linus in the
check out to save $5 on any purchase of
$10 or more so thanks for watching guys
