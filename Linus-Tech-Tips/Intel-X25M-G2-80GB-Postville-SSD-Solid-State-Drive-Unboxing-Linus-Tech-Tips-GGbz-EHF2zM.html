unboxing the Intel Gen 2 X 25 M so this
is their post fill version so basically
the biggest difference between this and
the Gen 1 is that it is a little bit
faster just to touch faster but it's
also managed to decrease the cost of
manufacturing to the point where they're
much more affordable than the genuine
drives so here's an installation guide
getting started handling precautions
blah blah blah how to install a notebook
most people are actually using these in
desktops despite the fact that it uses a
notebook form factor so here's a my SSD
rocks sticker that you can put on your
notebook or your case and then let's get
the drive itself open so we've got a
little electrostatic sensitive device
the stickers here get this open so
unlike the gen 1 drives which were all
black you can see that the gen 2 Drive
is actually black and silver
now this little adapter ring here the
black thing around the edge can actually
be removed so you can either install it
in a slim spot or in a full-size tuna
1/2 inch drive slot now for people who
are gonna be installing these I just
want to show you if it's gonna be in a
desktop you're just going to use a
standard SATA power and a standard say
that data cable just like that so it's
fairly straightforward but it won't fit
in a regular case so what you'll need is
an adaptor and we've actually got a
Silverstone three and a half inch to two
and a half inch Bay converter here this
is the can never remember this the SD
p08 and this is widely regarded to be
one of the better adapters out there
just because it's got a very solid steel
construction and you can actually mount
two SSDs in here so you mount one at the
bottom and you can kind of see the
screws there so we can line it up like
that and then you can stack another one
right on top of it so you can do two
SSDs in the space where you would
normally do one normal harddrive so we
can just have a quick look at this comes
with all the mounting screws you need
one other tremendously important feature
of the new gen 2 SSDs from Intel is that
it supports trim so if you're using
Windows 7 and a Gen 2 SSD it means it
automatically cleans up data and make
sure that it's always running at its
peak thanks for checking out my video
blog on the intel gen 2 SSD</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
