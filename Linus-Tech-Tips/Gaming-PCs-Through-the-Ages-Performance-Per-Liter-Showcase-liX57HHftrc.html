a sponsored piece on the Chronos a
desktop PC that Origen brags is the most
powerful and customizable small form
factor desktop a very bold claim but as
a bit of a small form-factor enthusiast
the idea of cramming unbelievable
Hardware into a tiny enclosure isn't
exactly new to me so I wanted to go a
totally different route with it and look
at how changes in hardware have
fundamentally changed the kind of
performance we can get out of tiny
gaming PC's over the last 10 years
welcome to performance per liter through
the ages
so at about ten point six liters the
origin Chronos is bigger than some of
the NDS FF cases that I've seen the Dan
case a for SFX that we featured recently
is a mere seven point two five litres
but the extra three litres seems to have
been put to good use at the front is an
LED lit logo and a much more reasonable
front IO configuration than the a4 sfx's
single USB 3 and power button two USB 3
front audio power and reset switches
most of the panels are vented and the
internals are laid out so the four
included magnetic feet can be used to
flip Chronos on its side depending on
your space requirements then over on the
left above the video card window is its
biggest advantage a single water cooling
radiator with a slim 120 millimeter fan
that's responsible for keeping the CPU
and the socket area cool even with some
overclocking moving to the inside we
find our decked out hardware config
core 16 gigs of DDR 4 memory a Titan X
Pascal a one terabyte Samsung SSD with
an additional hard drive for storage a
600 watt power supply and an 80
millimeter cooling fan so that's where
some of the internal space went up to
and some extra airflow for those drives
so let's take a look then at what we're
putting it up against we went back in
time or at least we went to free gig
Vancouver those guys are awesome and
have been keeping us supplied with old
hardware for our projects for a little
while now and we scrounged up these
gaming enthusiasts configs from 10 6 &amp;amp; 3
years ago each build should represent a
common enthusiast DIY case at the time
in spite of Intel's best efforts ATX is
still with us so they're actually pretty
similar in size the best of the best
single CPU and a top-tier GPU
unfortunately we couldn't get a working
8800 GTX in time for testing but we can
extrapolate values based on our 8800
yes and it's based on the same dat chip
so we'll start with pure CPU performance
in the last 10 years enthusiasts have
gone from quad-core machines that churn
out about 3500 points in CPU mark and
250 points in Cinebench to 10 core
monsters that can do anywhere from five
to nine times that performance in
multi-threaded workloads though it
should be noted that when it comes to
single threaded performance the gains
aren't quite as impressive at a little
over double our only real mixed CPU GPU
benchmark a 4k video export of Adobe's
test project at our usual LTT presets
yields much smaller improvements a fermi
or greater CUDA GPU with a fast enough
CPU is still a great video editing
solution with most of the perf per liter
improvements coming from Chronos is
sighs moving on to gaming we see
impressive improvements on the
performance side of things with an older
game like half-life 2 ending up CPU
bottlenecked a few years ago at around
700 frames per second and a newer title
like Metro last light scaling
beautifully to the point where today's
system is 20 times faster making it
nearly 100 times faster per unit volume
so how then did all of this happen well
part of it is the ever shrinking
manufacturing processes on which these
components are built but that accounts
only for the improved performance not
for the shrinking of the system's so is
it then that older systems consumed much
more power and therefore output more
heat so they needed these big enclosures
actually not really going back to 2006
our system consumed only about 250 watts
from the wall compared to 385 for our
Kronos so a big part of the story here
seems to be thermal management these CPU
temps that you're looking at are
interesting only from an academic
perspective since we're using Intel
designed thermal solutions on all the
older machines
than something aftermarket or a
consistent cooler across the board but
what it does tell us is that Intel went
from considering nearly 70 degrees
acceptable back in 2006 all the way down
to targeting about 60 degrees which
happens to be the load temp of our 10
core Extreme Edition GPUs clearly
underwent a similar change Nvidia
thought 90 degrees was cool back in 2011
then dialed that back with GPU boost
limiting the more modern chips to adn
change the other big part of the story
seems to be fashion engineers are driven
by a demand from their management and
ultimately consumers to create solutions
and the availability of smaller and
smaller gaming machines has increased
dramatically in recent years
presumably because people want them
though with that said back to origins
claim about the Chronos being the most
powerful and customizable SFF gaming
system even if we substitute the volume
of small form-factor cases that were
available at the times of our older
systems Silverstone's
sto 1 + sto 2 and fractal designs node
304 ignoring though that the node 304 is
a mini ITX case and there were no mini
ITX x79 boards thanks to the latest
components today it still stacks up very
well no matter how far back you go so
thanks again to Origen and Intel for
sending us the Chronos and sponsoring us
to lock Jake in the warehouse last
weekend to complete all of these
benchmarks for our through the ages
investigation if you're looking for a
new PC check out the link to Origin PC
in the video description they've got a
ton of Black Friday and Cyber Monday
weekend deals including up to five
hundred and seventy-eight dollars in
savings on all Aeon 9 Series custom
desktop replacement laptops with the gtx
980m with free shipping and a ton of
promotions on their desktops including
free shipping free gift cards free SSDs
free backpacks or headsets and free
games so check that out below thanks for
watching guys get subscribed like
dislike all that good stuff and we will
see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
