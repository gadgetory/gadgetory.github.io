learn more welcome to my much requested
unboxing an overview of the NZXT h2 30
this is a quiet optimized case from each
from age to 30 called the age to 30 from
NZXT and it is the follow-up to their h2
something like that is what it was glad
anyway the point is it's more better and
more optimized and just generally
changed so let's go ahead and get out of
the case now you can see they are using
a hard phone which makes sense given the
more value optimized price point of this
particular case compared to some of them
were high-end stuff that they've done in
the past and I can't get this box open
because of ah yes my enemy and yet my
friend punch through handles never quite
sure what to think of them I got zapped
knew that was coming too I could feel
the static feel the burn feel the burn
of the styrofoam and the other more
different styrofoam alright so there's
not as much padding as I would have
liked to see on the corners but the good
news is that it's a fairly lightweight
case so it's going to be less of an
issue than if it were a very heavy case
but with that said even lightweight
cases once you fill them up with
hardware can tend to get quite heavy so
if I was ordering from someone like a
system integrator and I was ordering an
h2 30 I might you know opt for like a
heavy duty shipping box or something
along those lines so it comes with
plastic on the front which reveals a
glossy front panel that you can see is
probably about reflective enough for me
to catch b-roll operating the camera
there sure you can see that not too bad
but overall a very clean aesthetics so
on the right we find not a whole lot on
the left we find not a whole lot and on
the top we find not a whole lot except
for IO it actually kind of reminds me of
like antics old Sonata concept where
it's got like what they were calling at
the time piano black
and then just a very very clean overall
aesthetic so let's go ahead and open up
this front door here and have a look at
what's inside so no noise dampening
material again this is a more value a
budget-conscious case as you know us you
know folks who don't like to use the
word cheap might say so there's three
five and a quarter inch bays as well as
a fan filter here that actually looks
like it's not removable you're going to
want to pull off the entire front piece
in order to gain access to that
cleanable filter so then all you have to
do is pop these off however those work
and then you can yeah there we go there
we go
so it pops off like that just pull it
off that way all right which reveals the
single 120 millimeter quiet fan in the
front as well as another spot for an
additional 120 millimeter fan on the top
of the case we find our i/o so there's
your power switch which has an
integrated led microphone headphone USB
3 as well as a reset switch then on the
back of the case we find not a whole lot
to write home about a 120 millimeter fan
io 7 PCI slots additional ventilation
and a bottom mounted power supply so I'm
going to go ahead and throw this back on
we're going to open it up with back a
moment one thing NZXT is good about is
typically they're cases the thumb screws
aren't over torqued at the factories are
able to get them off with your hand
which is kind of nice we open it up to
find noise dampening foam so the front
relies simply on layers of material in
order to block noise from reaching the
user whereas the side panels do use a
like a soft foam that's glued to the
inside of both side panels the right and
the left so we're going to go ahead and
pull both of those off there you go you
can see more noise dampening foam over
there and that leads us to the interior
where we don't really find too much
that's that different although on a
budget oriented case haha see I'm
avoiding that word again
it's nice to see this removable hard
drive cage so you can install pretty
much whatever graphics card you could
possibly want and those front intake
fans so if you were to put a very
high-end graphics card in here I'd
probably throw another fan in that top
slot they're not going to be starved
because they're going to draw air in
from
these vents that are positioned on the
right and on the well on the one side
anyway so there you go it accepts six
three and a half inch or two and a half
inch drives and it's got hard drive
sleds that are actually accessible from
the backside on this particular case
this is something NZXT s has started
doing recently so you can see the three
and a half inch drive mechanism is
tooless whereas the two and a half inch
drives get screwed into the plastic
retention sleds there we go so those
clip in just like that on the back we
find all of our cable management room so
you can see that what they've done is
they've actually punched out the space
near the power supply and along the path
of the 24 pin to provide just enough
room for a 24 pin cable here whereas on
the bulk of the back of the motherboard
tray we see things like reinforcements
punched into it as well as lots of
little hooks this is another thing NZXT
is great for is lots of little cable
management hooks all over the freaking
place like they are just like all over
the back of this motherboard tray it's
great because it allows you to keep your
cables flat and get your side panel on
without it like warping out away from it
and there's not a whole ton of room back
here for cable management so I do like
to see that very large CPU cut out so
you're going to be able to swap your CPU
cooler regardless of whether you feel
like taking your motherboard out or not
and the interior cables even though it's
not a windowed case I still like to see
this happen to be black so there's your
front USB 3 there's your front HD audio
as well as your front panel connectors
and finally a molex connector and I will
have to figure out what the devil that
is for my guess would be a fan
controller but I didn't see one just a
moment and the last thing here is a
4-pin molex connector or 3 pin fan
connector so that's for that front fan
other than that we've got full to a list
for the five and a quarter inch base so
that's internal to lists as well as a to
list mechanism for actually removing the
things here so you just pull in these
little clips and you can pull them out
just a little something like oh you
could drop them inside the case could
also do that and then last but not least
we've got a removable filter down here
in the bottom so that's going to keep
that air coming in to your power supply
filtered and these feet are going to
keep the case up
off the floor enough that is not going
to suffocate even if you put it on a
carpeted surface which I've actually had
happen with a computer before that was a
that was very unfortunate thank you for
