in year started on what was either a
very promising or very ominous note you
see when manufacturers with whom I have
a long-standing relationship simply drop
something in the mail to me rather than
asking if I want to review it first it
either indicates that it's junk that
they know no one will want but they have
to send out a certain number of review
units and they figure once it's in my
hands I kind of have to review it or it
indicates that they're certain it's
gonna blow my socks off so they want to
get it in the mail rather than wait for
me to confirm that my socks are on and
ready to be blown off but which one is
this if you're into earphones I guess
watch on to find out and if you're into
gaming PC's make sure you're subscribed
because this video isn't about that but
our 2014 holiday PC buyers guide is
coming next week Corsair gaming RGB
keyboards feature precision Cherry MX
RGB key switches for sixteen point eight
million color / key backlighting for
virtually unlimited customization click
now to learn more it starts with the
package it always does doesn't it the
momentum in years come with four sizes
of ear tips
I used the extra small ones because the
size of your ear canals obviously has
nothing to do with other things my wife
can back me up on this and this super
amazing carrying case that I immediately
discarded because any ie I'm not rugged
enough to be coiled up and thrown in my
pocket is not worth buying to me I mean
the thing is called momentum so if I
can't keep it in my pants then I guess
that's just nature for you right my wife
can back me up on this to talking about
right earphones so let's do the whole
physical overview thing shall we
we'll start with the bottom I guess
where we find a four pole
three-and-a-half millimeter right angle
Jack attached to a one-and-a-half meter
long oval elliptical cable thing that
manages to not be bulky but also being
surprisingly tangle resistant for how
light and thin it is moving up we've got
a tasteful plastic accent where the
black cable splits into a striking black
and red color scheme that I think works
really well a strong wire management
slider
the inline microphone and remote one of
the biggest points of differentiation
for this headset you see most
manufacturers sit on either the Android
or Apple side of the fence so while the
mic will work and volume control should
work single pressing the middle button
to play and pause audio might work and
double or triple pressing for additional
functionality probably won't if you
don't have a compatible device because
everyone handles the signaling on the
phone and a little bit differently
Sennheiser is partially getting around
this by maintaining two completely
separate models of this in year one for
Apple users and one for Samsung Galaxy
or Android users now this solution isn't
perfect and many Android phones
including at z2 and Luke's Moto X still
won't work with the Galaxy version but
my HTC One m8 worked and Brandon's Nexus
5 works just fine they have a
compatibility list on their site so
while it's not perfect at least as a
step in the right direction and kudos to
Sennheiser for this now let's have a
look at the in-ears themselves well I
don't consider if one earbud is slightly
more fashionable than the next one as a
top priority when shopping for something
you're planning to wear outside of the
house it can't be completely ignored
either and I think Sennheiser's done a
good job here their logo is grid
engraved in a shiny multicolored plastic
end cap that's set into a black strain
relieving wire loop thing and the rest
of the housing is this shiny red plastic
that might not go perfectly with my eye
color but it's certainly eye catching
the ear tips are installed on a metal
nozzle that Sennheiser and I'm not sure
if they're joking here calls a sound
tunnel that sits at a 15 degree angle to
the rest of the housing for
theoretically improved comfort and they
are your run-of-the-mill silicone type
with unfortunately no included memory
foam tips although comply loggers need
not despair as they should be compatible
with aftermarket tips that work with the
Sennheiser ie8 now moving into the
actual use of the momentum in years I
think I should start with my biggest
gripe about these in years they stay in
my ears fine but I just didn't find them
that comfortable your mileage may vary
but having used ie 80s for so long
very accustomed to using my ears as
cable strain relief and I found that in
spite of the lightweight cable having
their anchor point sticking so far out
of my ears paused more pull than I'd
like while I was wearing them user
reports on comfort seem to fly directly
in the face of my experience though so
it's possible that my ear shape simply
doesn't work that well with them when it
comes to comfort but the sound quality
is a different story
I did not listening with my usual mix of
top 40 garbage music on an iPhone 6 and
an Xperia z2 and initially I have to say
I wasn't that impressed because I was
comparing against my daily drivers the
IE eighties and next to lows with the
bass ports dialed to 4 like I've been
doing lately
the base is unexceptional in the mids
lacks strength but I realized after
having already started writing my notes
for this review what a stupid comparison
that was because they cost a third as
much as the IE eighties so I picked up
the similarly affordable and very very
well-regarded shure se215 specifically
to have a reasonable head-to-head get it
contender for the momentum in years and
listening to those side by side gave me
a completely new appreciation for the
sound of these earphones they do have a
v-shaped sound signature with more
emphasis on the lows and highs but bass
is well controlled and doesn't overpower
the slightly recessed mids meaning that
vocalists won't have that far away or
tinny sound that you get with many beats
generation tuned audio products highs
are clear and detailed without any of
the fatiguing harshness that I find so
unappealing with headphones that have a
lot of sparkle and the highs and overall
I guess I would just say compared to the
shirts they sound richer warmer and much
more fun the sub-base Rumble that you
get from a really nice bass guitar in
the background is powerful enough to
make you really pay attention to it you
can actually hear it but it doesn't
muddy up the rest of the track they're a
pleasure to listen to but like any
hundred dollar product there are
trade-offs and where the shares come
away as clear winners is in noise
isolation and comfort for me the first
one I guess is justifiable if the idea
is to wear the well
can you round on train tracks and not
get hit by a train that you don't hear
coming
but while the sure flexible wire
over-the-air system might be a little
bit cumbersome to put on and might look
a little bit doofy as someone who
doesn't need inline controls and likes
his IEM so comfortable he can sleep in
them without a special pillow the se215
s hold a lot of Appeal but the missing
piece of the puzzle here is long-term
durability and one of our moderators on
the forum has shared a horror story with
me about the not very robust looking
earphone connector failing multiple
times within a few months until his
warranty expired and with my experience
with removable IEM cables I don't find
it terribly hard to believe so the
conclusion is this solid product worthy
of the momentum named comfort was a weak
point for me but I seem to be in the
minority here and gosh are they ever fun
to listen to for a hundred bucks
speaking of fun yeah who's a v8 launcher
is launching in Canada and as someone
who's never used a third-party launcher
using it was a pretty different
experience for me some stuff like the
way it automatically categorizes your
apps
I was already able to do lb it manually
with folders but the swipe up quick
dialer is fast and intuitive the
replacement app tray is much better to
navigate from the ones in many Android
skins the way it prompts you when
relevant events occur like asking if you
want to launch a music player when you
plug in your headphones and app
suggestions on the different spaces make
the Android experience easier more than
anything else especially for new users I
mean I was expecting it to just kind of
be full of yahoo apps to install but
while some stuff like the news widget
that sends you stories in the morning
and after work are can be powered by
Yahoo a lot of the rest of it was just
useful stuff that I hadn't thought of
putting on my phone before so guys if
any of that looked interesting to you
check out Yahoo a v8 on the Google Play
Store there's a link in the video
description and a big thanks to Yahoo
