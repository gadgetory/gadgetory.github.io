was actually a pretty good chance that
someone shopping for a PC was buying one
for the first time maybe to check out
that newfangled internet these days
though not only does pretty much every
household in the u.s. already have a
computer but with the slow iterative
improvement that Intel has been making
over the last 5 years unless it's a
pretty darn old one it probably does
everything they really need it to do and
an upgrade to the latest hardware would
be unlikely to bring about a worthwhile
increase in performance but AMD's Rison
promised to give people a reason to
upgrade again bringing more processing
cores than ever before
to lower price points than ever before
so now that the whole lineup is
available is it actually worth the
upgrade for you we've got the answer and
you can watch the video for it or you
can just click
shade-tree sunglasses are handmade from
hardwood feature polarized lenses and
come with soft and hard carrying cases
use offer code Lynas to get five bucks
off below performance aside Bryson's
early bugs prevented us from issuing a
full-on recommendation but the good news
today is that many of the issues present
at Rison seventh launch have now been
fixed as long as you don't try using ram
faster than 3200 megahertz which we've
tested to be the point of greatly
diminishing returns anyway and this is
great because there are reasons to
upgrade to a new system beyond raw cpu
speed both mechanical and solid-state
drives
slow down over time maybe you've got a
bad capacitor somewhere causing weird
stability issues or maybe you just want
more modern features like MDOT to drive
support and native USB 3.1 10 gigabit
the last of which is actually unique to
AMD's platform at this time now our
initial testing of each Rison product
has consistently put AMD's offerings in
the same general ballpark as the blue
team's similarly priced modern
counterparts typically trading off per
thread performance for sometimes vastly
superior multi-threaded performance with
background tasks like encoding and
streaming gameplay simultaneously
benefitting dramatically you can see
just how much in our stream quality
investigation here
so AMD likes to think that all of this
makes for a very compelling deal but how
does rise and stack up against your old
battle station we've grabbed four common
cpus off-the-shelf
since the turn of the decade to answer
this question once and for all now as we
dive in with gaming and single threaded
workloads we can already see how the
trade-off between per thread and
multi-threading impacts Rison it
generally trails behind even intel's
older hardware and games but beats even
Intel's newest offerings in
multi-threaded workloads
so if you're a gamer running an older
core i5 or Core i7 and you are into
streamer and you're not interested in
any of the platform improvements
honestly you might be better off
investing in some more cool games to
play or like a new wireless mouse or
something with that said if you're in
the never Intel camp and during AMD user
who's been waiting and waiting for a
compelling upgrade go ahead pull the
trigger and feel good about it now let's
look at the productivity and creative
workloads Wow if your use case isn't
purely gaming it's pretty much a sure
thing that you're gonna realize some
kind of noticeable performance benefit
from an upgrade to Rison as we observed
in our launch reviews even compared to
Intel's latest and greatest in today's
multitasking world especially risin 5
and rise in seven are an absolute breath
of fresh air Rison delivers a strong
value for multitaskers and content
creators pretty much across the board
now we could have just left our
comparison there but it's pretty common
practice as a system nears its best
before date to try to squeeze a little
more life out of it through overclocking
so we decided to take advantage of Ryze
ins across the board overclocking
support and run all the tests again
against the older CPUs also overclocked
overall the story here is actually
pretty similar to be honest Intel CPUs
even going back five years are great for
gaming and turning up the juice on them
wasn't going to change that
with that said for the folks with mixed
workloads you know 3d animator by day
gamer by night those guys will be really
happy to see rise and continue to
dominate the workloads that they need to
make money and close the gap somewhat in
games pushing more of the system
bottleneck onto the GPU so it comes down
then to what matters most to you
Intel is the undisputed game
King and even folks with 2nd or 3rd gen
core i5s and i7s wouldn't see enough
performance benefit to justify an
upgrade to rise in and sadly outside of
some edge cases like high refresh rate
1080p gaming that kind of applies to
Intel's latest - but if you're an AMD
user or your work relies on
multi-threading or heavy multitasking
then you'll find that Rison has a lot to
offer and without unforgivable
sacrifices in gaming especially if you
pair it with a B or x-series motherboard
and a decent cooler so you can take
advantage of XFR and overclocking to get
the most out of it so then as I
mentioned before you'll find some good
better best combo recommendations for
your shopping convenience links below
and enjoy your new CPU in collaboration
with JBL mass drop is bringing us the
LSR 30x based on the best five inch
powered reference monitor in its price
range it's powered by two 41 watt Class
D amplifiers and the LS are 30x delivers
strong base smooth highs and even this
throughout the frequency response you
can use the low and high frequency trim
switches to fine tune the amount of bass
and treble to compensate for the room
you're in and it features XLR and TRS
inputs so you can connect your speakers
to many different sources they come with
rubber isolation feet and you can check
