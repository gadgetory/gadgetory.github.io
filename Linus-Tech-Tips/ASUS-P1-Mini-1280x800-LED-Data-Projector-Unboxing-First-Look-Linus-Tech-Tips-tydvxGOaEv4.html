first projector in the north american
market now they've been doing projectors
for a while but this is you guessed it
they're first in the North American
market which means this is my first look
at an asus projector so this is the p1
it is a portable LED DLP pocket
projector which basically means it's got
low power consumption it's got a good
small form factor for traveling business
presentations in particular are one of
these sort of intended uses for this
particular product I'm going to just
sort of start opening it up and then
we'll get a little bit further into the
details that asus has on the outside of
the box once I've got the accessories
unpacked this particular one is a if not
a retail not a retail sample so that
means that it is was already opened
before I got a chance to open it so
let's have a closer look at the
packaging itself to see what Asus
figures is special about this guy so LED
means up to 30,000 hours of lifetime it
also means instant on and off so there's
no waiting for cooldown times and warmup
times HD resolution so that's not full
HD but it's 1280 by 800 it's plenty for
a PowerPoint or a spreadsheet Auto
Keystone correction is gonna be handy
because I'll show you guys all okay I'll
show you guys after but it's got instant
height adjustment which means that you
instead of using a little screw on the
bottom that you often use to adjust the
angle of the projector just has a little
flip out stand it is a short throw
projector so at a distance of one meter
so that is about the distance from here
to the wall I can actually project a 40
inch image so I'm going to show you guys
that afterwards as well ultra
lightweight sure got it and I think that
pretty much covers everything that we've
got on the box itself 200 lumens
brightness okay so that's pretty that's
pretty possible from other products in
this
the product class now this is a cool
thing as well check this out so the
included adapter I don't know if you
you've no notice or not but that is the
same adapter that gets used on the
majority of isus notebooks so you have
to make sure that the particular Asus
notebook is capable of providing enough
power so in this case you want to make
sure that it's at least a three point
four two amp adapter but as long as it's
capable of providing enough power the
actual plug will be compatible so that's
pretty cool right we've also got a VGA
to appears to be no nothing iPhone
adapter only one way to find out for
sure huh No hold on a minute guys all I
hardcore failed there guys this is an
input on the projector and then these
are inputs you've got composite as well
as VGA input to the projector with this
particular cable so the other things we
see included here are your Quick Start
Guide as well as your disk whatever you
could possibly need that for as well as
a carrying case also included in the
package there you go it's got your
zipper on one side throw the projector
in there it's got your zipper on the
other side to throw your cables and
whatnot in there so that's pretty cool
now let's have a look at the projector
unit itself so it's very very small
about the same dimensions as like as a
CD disc case so that means here let's go
ahead and I'll throw it in the case you
guys can see that it's gonna look like
once it goes in there so it's this big
and then if you're not carrying around
any accessories like maybe you have your
laptop and you're traveling you got your
laptop power adapter you make sure your
laptops charged before the meeting you
can just carry the one power adapter
plug that into the projector once you
get all set up and then run the laptop
off battery so you won't even have to
carry around anything extra you can just
fold up the excess and it'll be about
yay big
very very nice it actually uses a
magnesium alloy case which means that
without any fans at all it would appear
that's cool oh no wait we got one
we got one but it should operate fairly
cool and fairly quiet especially because
it is using an LED light which means
that there's less heat output from that
source as well as the fact that it has a
heat conductive casing so let's look at
the physical aspects of it for a little
bit here so we've got our focus okay
we've got our navigation buttons on here
you know what I actually have a cheat
sheet for all of this so yeah there's
your function keys let's see what they
all do menu source and power button okay
that's all there and then we've got on
the bottom view you can see this is a
sample not for sale we have a tripod
socket as well as the supporting stand
which I'll show you in a minute
from the front we've got the projection
lens no lens cover that's kind of an
interesting thing I wonder if the retail
unit comes with a lens cover probably
wouldn't be a bad idea throw that back
to a soos although if you're keeping it
in the case which you probably should
it's got a nice soft velvety sort of
internal so as long as nobody walks up
to your projector while you're using it
and like goes like that with a quarter
or whatever then you should be in pretty
good shape and then from the back you
got your Kensington lock as well as your
power adapter on this side we've also
got our input so that was for VGA and
pomp is it so I can show you guys how
that works you can see it's labeled with
this side up there we go
and aside from the fairly limited inputs
I'd say this is more of a convenience
product than anything else so no you're
not going to be gaming on it you're not
going to be you know watching HD movies
in a home feeder this is a very more
travel friendly practical type of
product so you go ahead you flip out the
stand like that because a lot of the
time when you aim the projector right on
the table you end up with an image
that's cut off by the table itself or
too low to really be useful to anybody
so you go ahead you flip out the stand
you put it up like that and then one
meter away from the wall you should be
able to project a 40 40 inch image so
we're going to try that in a minute
and oh yeah has Auto Keystone which
means that it'll just adjust using a
sensor in the projector unit itself for
how much of an angle it's at and make
sure
that it is projecting a flat image at
the wall so that's pretty cool give me a
sec here guys we're gonna show you the
short throw lens that's going on here so
here we are testing out a Seuss's claim
that a mere one meter away from the wall
that's three feet for you Yanks one
meter away from the wall which is what
we are we can achieve a 40 inch that is
however many centimeters that is because
even here in Canada we do TVs in inches
a 40 inch diagonal image we have 41
inches so we have met or beaten the
specification however as are you kidding
me no I'm not paying attention to you
right now so sorry a little flustered
now so as you can see the image is quite
washed out although if you take a look
at the lights that we have pointing at
it that is fairly obvious why that would
be so let's try killing one of the
lights here you can see now we end up
with a fairly usable image so even in a
fairly lit presentation room we should
be able to bring out some kind of
document and okay apparently Firefox's
not real happy sorry my netbooks pretty
slow so it takes a while to load this is
like a first generation netbook I only
really use it when I go somewhere where
I can't bring a real computer so
google.ca so you can see what sort of
text is going on the filing will
keyboard table whatever the price was
right at the time this was as cheap as a
computer God so there we go so in a
fairly lit environment this is what we
can expect so even at our 40 inch size
it looks pretty darn good however if
you're able to dim the lights
it looks significantly better and
supposing you were using the p1 in a
scenario where you actually can
eliminate the lights all of a sudden you
end up with a pretty darn bright image
considering the form factor of this
projector and the fact that even though
we're not in Eco mode so you're not
going to get the 30,000 hours of battery
life you'll still get like well over
10,000 hours of
your life so that's very very impressive
for the kind of brightness for getting
out of it in fact I mean moving further
away from the wall I'd say with
reasonable usability you can get a
pretty darn huge image out of this thing
it starts to get it starts to lose a
little bit of the color here you can
also see the Auto Keystone working as I
tilt it up and down you see that see
making the adjustments so that's just me
angling the projector more or less and I
see how it retains somewhat straight
edges no matter what I do to it so I'm
just gonna go ahead and turn the lights
back on for a minute here and I think
that pretty much wraps it up I mean
there's the actually there's a couple of
menu options that there's someone
interesting so if you go in here the
menu is actually very easy to navigate
you've just got your navigation buttons
and then your enter button so we'll go
ahead and check out some of the splendid
video options so you got standard black
board white board dynamic mode dynamic
mode doesn't seem to be that great the
game mode looks pretty sharp scenery
mode theater mode I wouldn't mind if
they had a yellow wall mode because a
lot of presentations are done on walls
that are not 100% white so that would
have been pretty nice to see included
you can also adjust things like the
image setting there you go so you can
help nope that's not the right one where
is it it's in setup maybe yeah setup so
you can set the AHA the lamp are so high
or low there you go so that's the
difference between high and low actually
I should let you see that with the with
the lights more off here so low and high
looks just like that and I think that
pretty much wraps it up here guys press
the power button again to shut off look
at that instant off oh and hey if I
wanted to turn it on again I never
showed you guys the instant on
functionality it turns on pretty much
instantly it takes about I think a
Seuss's spec is five seconds to warm up
so there you go thank you for checking
