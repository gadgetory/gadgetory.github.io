are used to getting a whole new
generation of graphics cards with
noticeably better performance that they
can easily slot into their existing
system for a quick upgrade console fans
though are usually forced to wait long
periods for a new generation of tech for
example it was eight freaking years
between the release date of the Xbox 360
and the Xbox one so to alleviate this
problem somewhat console makers have
been releasing incremental updates to
existing platforms just like the new
Xbox one s from Microsoft with improved
performance and functionality beyond
just being smaller
can it trade blows with a modern gaming
PC let's find out mass drop is featuring
the AKG K 5 5 3 Pro Studio Headphones
featuring over-ear closed-back
construction check the mote in the link
in the description down below with past
console generations refreshes of the
same platform usually took the form of
adding enhanced connectivity such as
Wi-Fi and some additional storage space
but the Xbox one ass has taken a bit of
a different approach to console redesign
although there is now a 2 terabyte
option doubling the capacity of the
previous largest Xbox one model the
other improvements are quite a bit more
interesting not only is the Xbox 1s 40
percent smaller than the original
behemoth microsoft also ditched the
massive external power brick in favour
for an internal power supply you now
only need to use one rather small power
cord to plug it into the wall despite
this the 1s remains surprisingly light
and easy enough to move around when you
need to so points to Microsoft for that
the standard edition comes in a white
color scheme with black trim which in my
opinion is pretty slick especially
compared to the original Xbox one which
some folks myself included said looked a
little drab in the box you'll find an
updated controller which is very similar
to the original but with bluetooth for
connecting to PCs some improved range
and a textured grip so it won't go
squirting out of your hand in a tense
moment also this new IR blaster which
can accept inputs for multiple
devices so you can control things like
your TV and one of the big selling
points here is 4k support which is
completely absent from the original Xbox
one but there's a caveat perhaps
unsurprisingly this doesn't mean you can
render games at 4k if you want this
you'll have to wait for yet another Xbox
update codenamed project Scorpio due in
late 2017 what the Xbox 1's does instead
is upscale 1080p games to 4k so the Xbox
will play nicely with your 4k TV in your
living room if you have one but do note
that your TV or monitor will need to be
hdmi 2.0 compliant for this upscaling to
work at all but if you can live without
true 4k gaming and are mainly interested
in using 4k to watch movies and TV shows
the good news is that the Xbox 1s can
not only handle 4k streaming from
services like Netflix but also supports
4k blu-ray discs natively a very nice
feature for home theater enthusiasts who
want the superior sound quality of a
physical disc and folks who don't have
good enough internet connection to
stream 4k by comparison the Xbox 1s is
closest competitor the
soon-to-be-released PlayStation 4 Pro
only supports HD blu-ray the 1s also
features HDR or high dynamic range
support which will give you nicer colors
and more realistic contrast if you have
a TV that supports it but what's going
on inside the internals are mostly the
same as you can see from these teardown
photos from our friends over at I fix it
but one very interesting difference is
the SOC has undergone a die shrink using
a 16 nanometer process as opposed to the
28 present in the original Xbox one this
allows it to use less power probably the
reason Microsoft was able to fit the PSU
inside the chassis and to be clocked
significantly faster
indeed the Xbox 1's supports 914
megahertz on the GPU
61 more than the original model and that
leads into the $64,000 question how well
does it gain a common point made by PC
gamers who eschew consoles is that even
a mid-range GPU will easily outperform
the latest consoles so we put the Xbox
1s up
against the moderately priced ambi
radeon RX 470 as well as the more
premium nvidia geforce gtx 1070 to see
how close the console can get to pc
quality visuals in three different
titles the system we use with our RX 470
came in just at about 500 US dollars on
pc part picker while our more
performance oriented gtx 1070 system
came in at just a little bit under
twelve hundred and fifty dollars
Microsoft has been pushing pretty hard
how the Xbox one s apparently functions
very well during intense sequences in
Gears of War 4 so let's start with that
make sure you have the cogwheel on
youtube set to 1080p 60 so that you can
see the differences here now to
microsoft's credit the game remained
perfectly playable even during combat
situations and the game looked quite
nice overall but it's rather easy to
tell here that both our mid-range and
higher-end pcs ran the game a lot more
smoothly even on ultra settings our pcs
GPUs also enabled slightly nicer looking
textures across the board
moving on to forza horizons 3 the
results were rather similar the RX 470
and the gtx 1070 gave us smoother
gameplay as well as better detail on
things like bodies of water and
environmental elements such as the sides
of these canyons draw distances also
appear to be quite a bit better on PC
although it must be noted if the problem
was not removed entirely just kind of
moved back to a hopefully less focused
on area there was also less aliasing
noticeable on things like guardrails and
foliage however we did run into some
stuttering issues on PC that we didn't
have to deal with on the Xbox which
Microsoft should be addressing with a
patch but nevertheless image quality was
a bit better on PC with smoother
gameplay even though we were running
things on Ultra settings it's just
unfortunate that we had yet another case
of a less polished PC version of a game
finally rise of the Tomb Raider this
game also looked actually quite good on
the Xbox 1s though once again it was a
lot less smooth and it was on either of
our PCs GPUs which were running the game
at the very high preset although the
Xbox 1s came in a lot closer to matching
our PC in the image quality department
than
the two previous games there were still
some noticeable differences on things
like these vertical sheets of ice Laura
Croft has to climb now moving on
unfortunately the X boxes for K output
did not want to play nicely with our
capture equipment so we don't have
footage for you but what I can tell you
is that the upscaling was quite good in
all of our test titles although it's
still light behind PC in terms of
smoothness of play and image quality and
in no way does this upscaling substitute
for actual native 4k rendering our game
still looks pretty darn good without any
significant slowdowns from the 1080p
mode or excessive blurriness or any of
that stuff so if you happen to have a 4k
TV I definitely recommend enabling this
feature and at least trying it out now
this performance section may have come
across rather negative to the 1s but put
into perspective of price it actually
shouldn't there are obvious and major
trade-offs like the upgrade ability of a
PC the versatility of a keyboard and
mouse for input the expandability the
option to do other things etc etc I'm
sure you're all well-versed in this but
despite all of that and despite my
preference definitely being on the PC
side of things getting for 300 US
dollars 4k blu-ray support which is
nearly impossible to find on PCs right
now and some actually pretty decent
performance was impressive personally of
course I would choose a PC any day for a
huge amount of reasons like the agility
of an SSD for the wide variety of tasks
that I perform on a computer at a time
to actually being able to get work done
in an optimal setting but what do you
choose let me know on the comments down
below and try not to kill each other
while you're at it that would be
wonderful
