about but today's test is going to be in
my opinion pretty interesting because I
recently have a say the cable died on me
it was one of these ancient dfi LAN
party ones that I've kept around because
they're awesome and they're UV yellow
and stuff not this one it was a
different one so it occurred to me that
there's probably different stages of
failure nests in a particular cable
maybe there is maybe there hasn't kind
of DVI cables there's they work or they
don't
whereas VGA cables there's a wide
spectrum of quality in terms of the the
signal that they can transmit so what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to take four
different SATA cables including this is
an Intel one right here with proper
locking connectors on you go on whoops
both sides now you go locking connectors
both sides I'm gonna take an older-style
one with no locking connectors I'm gonna
take a long cable there you go so that's
a significantly longer cable I'm gonna
take another Intel one although a
different style without locking
connectors and then I'm gonna just take
like some random like the cheapest
feeling one I could find and then what
I'm going to do is run the as SSD a s
SSD benchmark a number of times on the
drive first with the original cable
which I'm going to use as my sort of
assumed fine cable it's an Intel cable
made by is link there you go there's
link something like that you can see
that there you go and then I've so I'll
run it a few times to make sure I get
consistent results and then I'm going to
go ahead and start swapping cables and
see what kind of results I get stay
tuned guys my control tests are all run
so this is this is pretty representative
of what we get with the Intel cable now
let's start running some of the other
cables I'm gonna start with the long
Foxconn cable I've been asked any number
of times to explain the difference
especially when they're included with
motherboards between SATA 6 gigabits per
second cables really not sure if you
guys can read that
well it says say 260 bit per second and
the say that - 3 gigabit per second
cables that are included with
motherboards and based on the results
that I'm getting with this particular
cable compared to the ones that I've
already run which are the Intel cable
the Foxconn long cable and the old
crappy dfi cable it looks like the
answer is what I suspected all along but
never had any empirical data to prove
looks like we're gonna end up with
pretty much identical results so I'll
show you guys the the final ones but yet
this is an unexpected addition to the
test
that I hadn't thought of doing before
well I finished my last test so this
means that the results that I have are
pretty much final so like I said it's
pretty much what I figured would happen
these first four are actually all the
Intel cable just two for me to run some
tests back to back to figure out what
the what the consistency of results was
going to be like so you can see the
overall benchmark score so we're gonna
call these four scores sort of our
margin of our margin of error so
anywhere from 470 to 464 will be
considered to be a sort of consistent
benchmark score with our with our
control group so here's the long cable
the first run the long cable the second
run so I stopped doing two runs per
cable when I realized how close together
results were going to be here's the old
crappy deify cable here is the asus six
gigabit per second specific cable here
is the red generic cable so what did we
learn today folks as long as your SATA
cable works it seems to pretty much work
that is not to say that cables cannot be
defective
I do have defective SATA cables that
don't work at all and cause glitchy
behavior but that's pretty rare I've
only had about two or three SATA cables
died on me in the years that say there's
been a relevant standard so I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
