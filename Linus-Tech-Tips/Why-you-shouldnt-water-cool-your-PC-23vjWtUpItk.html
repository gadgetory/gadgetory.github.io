it's time to choose a cooler for your
CPU there are so many options out there
but before you even really get into the
weeds you've got to make one choice do
you cool your PC with a large air cooler
or with an all-in-one liquid cooler now
if we can trust the marketing a iOS are
the clear choice water transfers heat so
much better than air right but is that
the entire story maybe actually I don't
know alex has been working on this in
isolation and I don't know the test
results so I'm just as eager to find out
as you guys are massive thanks to world
of tanks for sponsoring this video
World of Tanks is the free to play epic
online multiplayer game that features
authentic tanks from the mid 20th
century use invite code tank tastic at
the link below to get some great bonuses
now before you run out and buy a new CPU
cooler you need to first figure out if
your CPU is gonna get any benefit from
additional cooling now in the old days
inadequate cooling was a recipe for
instant catastrophic failure because the
modern protection or throttling
mechanisms that prevent them from
exceeding that generally accepted
maximum of a hundred degrees Celsius
didn't exist yet
but just because both Intel and AMD
seemed to agree that their processors
will last at least through their
warranty period at that temperature
doesn't mean having it there is a great
idea the hotter in integrated circuit
runs the more power it will consume and
the shorter its lifespan will be and
furthermore when your CPU does approach
its limit you can experience greatly
reduced performance that throttling
mechanism that I alluded to before so if
your only goal is not sacrificing
performance then temperatures that don't
exceed 90 degrees it's honestly a good
spot to start with 65 to 75 under full
load being the conventional wisdom
target as well as contributing to a
quieter computing experience overall so
finally getting to our PC then in here
we've got an RT X 27 T and an Intel Core
i7 9700 K but since any decent cooler
can keep the stock 95 watt 9700 K at bay
provided you don't live in the Sahara of
course we cranked it up to a blistering
5 gigahertz on all eight cores at a
voltage of one point three three volts
bringing it up to a hundred and sixty
watts now we definitely need something a
bit more robust or do we
this overclock was actually achieved
using just a Noctua NF u 12s a mid range
air cooler coming in at just $60 and
with just one fan it was able to keep us
at a max of 84 degrees now that is a
little toasty and with our fan at full
blast it was a little loud at least by
Noctua standards at 45 decibels so well
now it's time to go water cooling then
right
maybe but not until we've adjusted our
test setup the thing is 43 decibels is
clearly audible and bordering on
annoying to have right next to your head
but for context the average office is 50
decibels so because noise is just as
important as cooling performance we had
to create an environment where we could
properly evaluate both okay so why don't
you show me what you've done here yes
welcome to my room of quietness this
used to be an office you know yes but
now it's uncomfortably silent so we know
this is kind of ghetto but it works via
the same principles as our recent server
room sound deadening video basically if
you take a bunch of loosely packed
permeable mass and you put it all around
where you're trying to block the sound
you don't get any standing waves it ends
up absorbing a lot of the sound that's
trying to come in and preventing any
reflections and bouncing so basically
because we can easily control the HVAC
this room has its own dedicated
thermostat and because we've got all
these beanbags set up we're able to
achieve what was it 20 success Abel's a
26 decibel noise floor in here that
means that we can comfortably measure
devices like this computer that are not
much above 30 now this computer has been
modified from our original configuration
a little bit so it's running four of
naktu as nf a 12 X 25 FLX fans with
their ultra-low noise adapter coming off
the power supply so these are at just
900 rpm that power supply is a prime
fanless titanium from see sonic unit so
it's not making any noise the graphics
card there's not much we can do your
systems gonna have a graphics card in it
but it does have a silent mode it does
have doesn't fans are off it has a
switch on it perfect thank you ROG Strix
so what this means then is that our only
variable is our CPU cooler now some of
you have probably noticed that the spot
were remanded the
radiators is in the top because we've
got case fans in the front here and that
was for a reason so on the one hand yes
drawing in fresh air for your radiator
is going to give it an advantage versus
drawing in warmed up air and exhausting
it out the top of the system however
what we found was that the disadvantage
from an acoustic standpoint of having it
right there in the front of the case was
much greater than the advantage it
gained from having access to fresh air
flow especially because you guys got to
consider this is not exactly a little
tiny mid tower chassis we've got three
intake fans so the ambient temperature
inside the case so to keep things as
real-world as possible we're using the
blender classroom test so that takes
about 17 minutes and that's enough time
to heat up most a iOS and we were having
issues where the whole room was heating
up two to three degrees and given that's
more than the variation between all of
our coolers we had to have HVAC on and
the door open and then run in at about
16 minutes turn the HVAC off measure the
acoustics and boom so with that out of
the way we're ready for the results that
we are are you excited
I actually am which one of these do you
think is the best cooling purely cooling
am I supposed to play devil's advocate
or am I actually guess actually guess I
would guess that it's gonna be the
triple 120 millimeter read from a sheer
mass and surface area perspective not
even in second this guy here really yep
which one do you think so hold on we're
talking raw performance at a given noise
level just raw performance straight-up
raw performance yep
this beats this 78 degrees 81 wow that's
not even that close no okay guess what
guess what sound level they're both at
then okay this one right here was at 36
okay 36 decibels
okay I would say this with only two fans
is gonna have to be a little louder 3834
really it's quieter too yeah and and the
worst part is that this right here yeah
it performs the 360 and isn't the 360
the one that comes with their new
redesigned cold plate yep
so the ASA Tech one it's only a two
degree difference but also like 79 81 so
so it's quieter as well yeah and this
right here garbage 86 degrees
this guy fared pretty well so ok well
now let's talk price to performance then
so we know this is our least expensive
offering this was like our mid tier air
cooler yeah this is probably more like
80 bucks right 70 bucks the one that I
really don't understand is how this
performs so well I guess this is really
a testament to how well heat pipes
perform then and also just Noctua like
they they just kill it they know they're
shiz but if you think about it like yes
water transfers heat very quickly but
heat pipes are also fluid heat transfer
so this is actually phase change cooling
on a certain level so then one point of
clarification though do you think this
is unique to Corsair the iOS like are
they just bad no I think they're pretty
good they're just like the largest
company for a iOS and they all use
basically the same design so it's the
most representative right because that's
what people are probably gonna buy I'm
gonna get you to take these two away
since they're done so things don't look
great for our water coolers but there is
more to the story than performance noise
levels and price to performance let's
run through some more pros and cons so
one big problem an additional problem
for water coolers is actually the pump
not only does that add additional noise
and cost it also adds a point of failure
and a nasty one too
since not only are pumps more likely to
fail than a fan but when they do it's
more catastrophic for your cooling
and it's harder to detect now if your
CPU fan dies then you can probably see
that it isn't spinning and then slap a
case fan on there until a new one
arrives with a pump you better hope that
you have your software monitoring
enabled and then when it does bite the
bullet you pretty much just need to pony
up for an entire new unit an
unattractive prospect since a iOS like I
said extra components tend to be more
expensive than heat sinks with similar
performance but that doesn't mean that a
iOS don't have some advantages because
it's full of water
na io has greater thermal mass than a
heat sink that means that even though
after a long load its performance might
not be as impressive during short bursts
like while your CPU is tur bowling up
that extra heat can be absorbed then
dissipated later without such stark
swings in temperatures also if you
regularly move your PC like to land
parties in search transportation is
arguably much safer with an AI oh I mean
we are talking for this guy
12 points of contact versus just 2 for
this big bulky air coolers have a lot of
weight hanging directly off of your CPU
socket which in some extreme cases can
actually lead to motherboards bending or
even breaking now this isn't as much of
an issue with brands that have good
mounting hardware which is one of the
reasons that we so strongly recommend
not to a but even with not to a mounting
if I needed to entrust my PC to an
airline or a parcel carrier I would
equip it with an AI oh another good
point for a iOS is the coolness factor
not not coolness for your CPU or even
for your motherboards vrm which can
benefit from incidental airflow that
bleeds away from the heatsink but I mean
coolness for showing off your PC now
naturally this comes down to personal
preference some people really like the
look of big air coolers yeah Thank You
Ellis but most of the time it's easier
to get a clue
overall look to your build with water
now one thing we haven't mentioned yet
is custom liquid cooling with a
top-of-the-line block from ek or alpha
cool a huge radiator and a d5 pump you
can get measurably better performance
than what is possible even with the
beefiest of air coolers the thing is at
that point it isn't really a fair
comparison anymore since a custom water
cooling setup is only for very advanced
users requires regular maintenance and
is incredibly expensive like just the
CPU block alone can cost more than our
Nhu 12a that's not to say custom water
cooling isn't awesome and that we don't
love it for ourselves it's just not the
kind of thing that we're comfortable

nope you know what's funny is I remember
back when these one 120-millimeter ASA
tech units first launched like 10 years
ago or whatever it was the initial
reviews for the ASA tech Elsie Elsie
go find reviews for it overwhelmingly
negative but then when the Corsair h50
turned up which was literally exactly
the same product with a different fan on
it the reviews get positive and I'm not
accusing III know the people of course
are very well I know for a fact they
didn't pay off anybody but like it's
just funny how a brand can like the
brand name and brand loyalty might
subliminally influence people like what
the ASA tech wants people be like yeah
it's not great and of course I would be
like yeah it's like it didn't perform as
good but like here's all these other
benefits I don't know it's a funny thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
