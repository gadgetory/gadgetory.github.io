uncomfortable desk chairs do you long
for the freedom and comfort of couch
gaming but are you plagued by uneven
surfaces for your mouse and keyboard do
the current solutions either provide you
with diminutive peripherals obviously
designed by smaller than average gnomes
that are unusable for your large meeting
man pause or come with a price tag so
exorbitant that you'd have to sell a
kidney to purchase it
well LPT has your back plucky consumer
in this short video we'll teach you
fabrication secrets that the big gaming
companies don't want you to know and
help you build a gaming platform that
will let you dominate noobs in comfort
while retaining each and every one of
your sweet juicy organs
if you haven't seen nerd sports yet
check it out all the episodes are
available now for free over at
youtube.com slash channel super fun let
me introduce what our team of
uncertified engineers is referring to as
the marks for knee base
peripheral support system or couch wood
it features a conveniently located 10
keyless mechanical keyboard a large
mousepad for enhanced FPS gameplay a
phone charging dock and a built-in
beverage holder if you'd like to
download the plans for this gaming
platform or see a detailed step-by-step
check it out at the link to the forum in
the video description so the first step
of constructing this marvel was to
measure and cut out the top surface we
wanted to ensure that we had a large
enough play area for even low
sensitivity gamers since one of the
objectives in building our own couch
gaming platform was not just to save
some money but also to fill some of the
gaps that we saw in the design of the
commercial products that we've reviewed
there's a slightly smaller bridge
portion across your knees and then an
equally large surface on the other side
that serves as a counterweight and a
convenient snack holder with that
finished we immediately went into
cutting and attaching the small wooden
components that will hold your keyboard
phone and beverage in place we chose to
attach these fixtures right away for
very technical reasons that I'm not
going to bore you with and certainly not
because long-term planning is one of the
DIY team leaders personal development
goals for 2017 that being said those of
you at home who want to put this
together might go for the coward's route
of doing this step last so that you
don't potentially damage the extruding
pieces while attaching bulkier bottom
components the exact positioning of the
keyboard on the platform is pretty
flexible it's totally up to you and this
is by design so you can arrange its
location to be whatever is most
comfortable for your right hand the
large dangly
the lead designer on this project
dictated its current placement here but
for the more fun-sized members of our
staff you might prefer to have the
keyboard and mouse a little bit closer
together the two bottom boxes on either
side exist to hide cabling and provide a
measure of stability so that the surface
doesn't tip around while you're using it
we built these out of two by fours for a
solid weighty body but if you're afraid
that you're frail and feeble thighs
can't handle that sort of intensity you
can really choose any materials you want
a one by three would work just as well
once all the wood construction is
complete make it beautiful we went with
a dark dusky hue applied in smooth even
tones to accentuate the natural beauty
of the plywood but top just make sure
that you drill your holes for your
cables before you apply your wood stain
or you will be forced to go back again
and do touch-ups again thinking we're
pretty good at shrinking ahead
well there's a reason they call them
smart goals right once your wood stain
is dried you can lock down your
peripheral the mouse pad is attached
firmly to the surface and to avoid the
aggravation of the bumpiness that would
normally result from gluing it down we
opted to use screws and washers in the
corners our keyboard of choice with a
Corsair k-6 t5 but the couch wood is
also capable of accommodating larger
models if that's what you're into or
really pretty much anything by gluing
the wrist rest in place you'll not only
stave off the eventual onset of carpal
tunnel syndrome and maybe splinters in
your wrist but you'll also stop the
keyboard itself from sliding around a
USB hub on the underside of the surface
provides connections for the keyboard
mouse and phone charger and once you
have the cabling all locked into place
you can screw the bottom boxes into the
top surface to keep all that nonsense
out of sight now naturally you wouldn't
want to rest this on your knees for an
extended period of time as is so you'll
want to add some sort of cushioning to
the underside anything goes here but we
opted to attach a hassle
triple foam exercise roller as it
provided the gentle firmness and soft
support of a compassionate lover okay
Tyler we're gonna have to talk about
your scripts and if you've had a passing
flirtation with yoga the odds of you
having one of these lying around or
something like it are pretty good
although if the only downward-facing dog
that you know about if Snoopy then you
can order one off Amazon at the link in
the video description so at this point
then it's time for us to attach a
10-foot USB cord to the platform and get
to gaming so in the end the couch would
cost us a hundred and thirty-eight
dollars in materials to put together
though it should be noted that 75 of it
went directly towards the K 65
mechanical gaming keyboard so by using a
budget keyboard or simply one that you
already own
the cost of this project can be
comfortably kept under 70 bucks in
comparison the silver retails at 185 the
lap dog at 135 with no keyboard and the
Razer turret at 120 with a keyboard and
mouse I wouldn't consider acceptable for
gaming either of them so all told then
the construction process took just under
four hours split into two days to allow
for the wood stain to dry and while its
weighty the couch wood sits comfortably
on your knees and the large surface
provided a full range of Mouse movement
as well as a lot of flexibility because
building it yourself you don't have to
do it this way you can put the keyboard
over here which is probably what I would
do you could shorten the drink holder in
the snack holder you could make the
mousepad smaller and that's something
that an off-the-shelf solution just
can't do while it lacks the ability to
be tucked you know neatly out of sight
for a more discreet look in the living
room all told it's a sturdy enough
battleship of a platform that can
accommodate a full gaming experience so
if that's what you're after well it can
be done for just a few bucks have you
heard of using a VPN to browse the
Internet but never really gotten around
to looking into it well you don't
have to because with tunnel they're
using a VPN is as simple as heading over
to tunnel bears website linked in the
video description the download evenlike
starts automatically so you just install
it and boom that's it with tunnel bear
turned on once you press the little
button your internet connection is
secured and to the websites and services
that you use online you appear as though
you are a different person from an
entirely different country tunnel there
also has a top-rated privacy policy and
does not log your activity and if you
kind of want to go on you know could
this possibly be as simple as you said
you don't quite take my word for it
that's fine because all you got to do is
head over to tunnel bear comm /l PT and
try it with the first 500 megabytes for
free then you can save 10% if you decide
to go unlimited at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
if this video sucked you know what to do
but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button or check out the link
to where to buy the stuff that we
featured at Amazon in the video
description also linked down there is
our merch store which has full shirts
like this one and our community forum
which is water which you should totally
join now that you're done doing all that
stuff you're probably wondering what to
watch next so maybe check out the
reviews on the commercial lap board
products that we'll have linked up there
