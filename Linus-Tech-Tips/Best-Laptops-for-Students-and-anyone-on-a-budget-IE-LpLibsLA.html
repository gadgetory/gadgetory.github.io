school here at Linus media group it's
that things should be left until the
very last second so here is a laptop
roundup for back-to-school that is
dropping days before school starts
speaking of that the last minute if you
wanted to instantly see your current and
past Network activity you should check
out glasswire you can detect malware
block badly behaving apps on your PC or
Android device and you can use offer
code Linus to get 25 percent off at the
link below
so our first category for our top five
sort of here is the budget machine being
a student is pretty much synonymous with
not having disposable income or at least
not having any leftover after your
shopping carts full of ramen noodles and
your binge drinking so what's the best
way then to get something that is
functional enough on the cheap you might
think that you want a Chromebook but you
don't yes 90% or even 95% of the time
it'll work fine but that other five to
ten percent well let's just say that no
one is going to be clamoring to be in a
study group with you like having to use
the online version of Microsoft Office
or MATLAB
is functional for the most part but in
the end you'll have wasted a lot of time
just getting to where everyone else
started so with that out of the way
let's talk about what you should look
for to get the best value we can't be
too picky about the exact model but
eight gigs of ram and an SSD are both
musts these days and as for the CPU well
per core performance hasn't changed much
in the last couple of years so any dual
core is gonna do us pretty nicely but
power efficiency has so look for a sixth
or seventh generation intel on sale we
ended up finding a dell inspiron 15.6
inch that met our requirements for 95
bucks off at Best Buy that's under $300
so if we were to grab that and slap this
$35 SSD in it we're sitting pretty if
you've got a bit more to spend though
we'd recommend the surface go it's super
small and unlike previous costs down
surfaces like the RT it runs full-fat
Windows 10 for when you need it now it
isn't the fastest little laptop or the
cheapest but for $600 including their
touch cover keyboard the surface go is
hard to beat it's got an excellent
screen it's got a touch screen it's got
solid battery life and it's got a pretty
good little keyboard on it with little
of course being the operative word so
it's got everything is
NEADS and if you grab an optional stylus
for it it is fantastic for taking notes
in tablet mode the next step up from
there is to go from the small and
portable surface go to the slightly
larger but also very portable LG Graham
with a great IPS display for watching
movies a decent amount of power coming
from its quad-core processor and heaps a
battery life you can leave your power
brick at home without worrying about
locating a plug later on in the day the
socking lightness of the ground will
also have your back thanking you for not
getting that gaming laptop though with
that said if you are a hardcore gamer
and you can't rely on a secondary cheap
desktop for your fix we do still have
some options for you here first up then
is the Acer nitro 5 coming in at $800
this guy packs some serious punch with a
4 core Core i5 that goes up to 4
gigahertz and a gtx 1050 TI this thing
can handle basically any game on the
market as long as you don't expect to
crank up the in-game settings
alongside this one is also the Dell g3
which has pretty much the same specs but
it'll cost a bit more with the benefit
being that you don't have to go to
meetings carrying around the flashy er
nitro 5 which is probably enough to sell
this thing to a lot of people finally if
the 1050 Ti
doesn't quite have the grunt that you're
looking for then the GTX 1060 in the
predator Helios 300 is available for not
much more than those - all three of
these devices are highly recommended
assuming though that you don't mind
trading some battery life for
performance now everything up until now
has had its nice little niche carved out
for it but what if you're looking for
the all-rounder laptop power portability
battery life and style well my friend
then you are looking for the Dell XPS 15
with a quad-core CPU a gtx 1050 one of
the best keyboards in the biz not to
mention an awesome screen the XPS 15 is
maybe the most
laptop e laptop ever like there isn't a
whole lot that you can point at and say
is really special about it unless you
opt for the two-in-one version but
everything that it does it does to near
perfection that is as long as you don't
need to be on lots of conference calls
because the webcam kind of looks up your
nose so that's it for what's in front of
me but in response before you say the
Linus the only way to get laid in
college is with an Apple logo first of
all that's not entirely correct but if
you have to have an Apple laptop we will
still tell you which one's the best one
to pick in our opinion frankly you're an
idiot if you buy the MacBook Air before
it gets it's rumored refresh because it
currently rocks a 5th gen processor when
almost everything else on the market has
moved on to 8th gen the MacBook isn't
too bad but it is still a processor
generation behind and as for the MacBook
Pro well the one without the touch bar
is behind the times meaning that if you
must have a Mac we're gonna recommend
the MacBook Pro 13-inch with an 8th gen
Intel chip it's got the best touchpad
around and it's got a great screen
though we are still annoyed that you're
paying that much money for a laptop
without a touchscreen I personally find
that a touchscreen makes a much bigger
difference than you might expect
