decent movie and TV watching setup but
one of the biggest problems with it is
the girlfriend appeal factor he's just
using like standard monitors instead of
something a little classier for those of
you who don't know monitors means
powered speakers not just this kind of
monitor speaking of class thank you for
being the classy guy and leaving the
gigantic heavy box for me to deal with
by myself here so Sony sponsored this
video where we're gonna be upgrading his
setup with the HT z 9f this is a Dolby
Atmos surround capable speaker bar that
apparently doesn't care what size or
what shape your room is in order to
achieve its virtual surround and top
firing speakers and they also threw in
one of their X 900 ft V's for good
measure so let's go see if we can fix
things up a little shall we all right
kind of wish we'd brought a dolly oh how
nice of you to catch up you know I've
kind of got the heavier load here
today's gonna be an interesting lesson
on both the benefits and the drawbacks
of kind of like standards-based
marketing because we're gonna see that
you know when you have a dose that's
better than not having Atmos Oh
oh boy so this is the setup then I see
you've got all the features you've got
the Egyptian guy on the front I actually
don't really know what brand that is
you've got your convenient aux cable for
plugging it you use the three phone you
use it for the laptop actually so I'm
guessing you were getting some some
vibration transfer issues here and this
this is a not really that came with
wonderful shut up yeah that came with
them shut up I can't tell if you're
joking or not right now no 100% cuz they
sound really great like right here so
then as long as we're watching TV like
this then everyone is all very
comfortable near-field - good time very
very comfortable
Oh a little this very professional high
grade speaker wire we've got going on
here convenient red and black coloring
do you need a hand with this I think
you're supposed to carry these with two
people
well I'm carrying it is that a 55 inch
yeah
oh so the one we're putting in is a lot
bigger yeah sixty-five I hope it doesn't
like take over the space so very first
world problems we're gonna just put this
in here dude can I help you with this
this is just totally fine what the hell
is this I forgot about that oh good it
lights up right why would you put that
on there I've always gotten such a kick
out of the boxes for sound bars cuz like
it looks really stupid I guess sound
birthers
yeah I'm taking up a simple for now so
part of the the fancy magic tech in this
guy is that unlike other Dolby Atmos
sound bars which rely on upward firing
speakers this one achieves the virtual
overhead surround effect that it has
with only three forward firing speakers
yeah I have no clue how they do that and
then that's part also of what makes it
not care what kind of room you're in
because it's not actually bouncing the
signals so it must just be something to
do with some kind of fancy engineering
of like a delay of some sort yeah
there's like delays so you hear it like
sound is freakin complicated because
there's a lot more to it than just doing
this one earlier and like this one later
because if you think about it how would
you have three dimensional perception of
sound how would you know if something is
over top of you well it actually has to
do with like the way the sound waves
like bounce inside the shape of your ear
and like your brain learns to understand
that and the and the the way that the
volume changes is it has to kind of like
bounce around in there so it's like not
trivial to do something like hey TV's on
but what speaker is Izzie wait do we
even have it plugged into the sound bar
yet no do you have the Quick Start Guide
so I'm plugged into the TV arc yeah
awesome
switching audio to external Wow yeah
getting started searching for devices
bravia 4k connecting to you did Wow is
that all that I have to do
are you a grill guy or a naked guy I'm
thinking grill really if the whole point
of this is like better girlfriend appeal
yeah where we're putting the grill on
all right that's fair don't forget we
need room for the sub yep
where do you want to put that I think
that side personally that you can go
whichever room oh I was planning on
plenty like way over here all right it's
wireless yeah it's a wireless sub so
like that's one of the reasons why I was
like I didn't really want to get a sound
bar because you have to like put the sub
yeah so it's kind of thinking just like
stealth mode behind it yeah we go behind
the plant no one knows it's there also
one really great feature that I get with
this is the ability to turn the bass
down right that wasn't that wasn't a
thing with the monitors which is a
problem if you want to watch a movie at
like 1:00 in the morning do we want to
do the wireless speakers now or should
we do this later I kind of want to try
it without first yeah I was thinking so
- okay cool so before connected wow that
was easy
really yeah probably should Wi-Fi is
probably fine from here yeah it is okay
it's fine is that concrete wall no I'll
read it to you I'll read it to you is it
two three seven puh yep okay
why no six six just would you wait wait
what was that
do you know what HTMI we plugged in -
thank you - okay I just click on one
sorry yep yes 4k all right so we can
launch blu-ray discs Claire
oh man we have planet Earth - in here oh
that's way better
oh yeah all right we should do the demo
disc anyway just so we can hear the
Admiral stuff
this little sounds like it's kind of
coming from the front yeah it really
does oh there we go
I was like are we supposed to be
impressed right now let's try that again
shall we
yeah that's that's much water now
suppose it's just like a make it good
button yeah there's a big ol button it's
just vertical surround okay
now I'm getting some yeah definite stuff
going on around me these are pretty
cheesy demo animations though yeah I
mean the sound is Sony honestly it's
kind of idiot proof there's not really a
lot to change in here is there yeah
where's the how far away you are setting
speaker settings oh here we go wow that
is quite the measuring tape you've got
yourself there sir
so we're gonna call that 9 feet yeah and
we can really see the subwoofers what 11
all right well do you want to add the
satellites yeah all right how do we know
Mom I think that we just hit link on
those and maybe it'll just find them
okay not connected connected was the
subwoofer oh I guess we got to do the
subwoofer since we did manual linking
well so cool has chromecast built in
yeah it's just a nice whoa hello oh damn
not bad yeah it's a good thing you guys
have concrete walls here
I could be sold on that being us sitting
in a rainstorm yeah I also like if I was
blindfolded and he told me that there
are speakers there I'd probably believe
you yeah it really gives you the 360
with it yeah so there it is the sony HT
z 9f sitting pretty taking what once was
quite a cluttered set up to a very clean
one it's super impressive how they were
able to create that much of a surround
sound effect using just the three
front-facing speakers not just
horizontally but also vertically with
Dolby Atmos and it's made all the better
adding the two dedicated rear speakers
creating a particularly immersive movie
and TV watching experience yeah I'm
impressed well enjoy yeah I will so
thanks to Sony thanks to you guys for
watching if you just liked this video
that I guess you just hate Alex and you
don't you don't want to do that and you
don't want them to have nice things if
you liked it though hit like get
