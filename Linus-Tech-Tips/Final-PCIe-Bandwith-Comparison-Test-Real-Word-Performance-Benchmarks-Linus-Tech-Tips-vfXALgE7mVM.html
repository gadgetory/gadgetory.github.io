my PCIe 16x versus 8x versus 4x testing
this time I'm going to use a couple of
games that I've benchmarked quite a bit
in the past we're gonna go with
Battlefield Bad Company 2 as well as
Metro 2033 since I had people asking for
not a purely synthetic test so I'm going
to use the 6990 again single card gonna
run at 16 X 8 X + 4 X PCIe bandwidth and
see what kind of performance differences
we see at 1080p running in these games
so this was interesting not only did I
test that'll feel bad company 2 and
metro 2033 actually I've got my fraps
one of my fresh results up here right
now apparently I have a lot of them up
here right now
ok so I also added Crysis 2 to the
testing methodology so here you go here
my results in a very tiny little graph
that I have made on a piece of paper
along with a list of stuff that I had to
do the other day ok so here we are
oh please focus come on you're kidding
me ok yeah okay so Crysis 2 from 16x to
8x we're looking at pretty much within
margin of error but then as soon as we
drop down to 4x PCIe band width we lose
about 6 - well 6 to 8 FPS so that's
going to be about 10% so we do see a
tangible real-world performance decrease
on a very high performance card in
Crysis 2 going down to 4x that'll feel
bad company 2 once again we see cut it
within the margin of error and then as
soon as we go down to 4x we see a very
dramatic decrease in performance about
30% so metro 2033 is same story this is
margin of error right here and then
moving down to 4x we see a 12%
performance dropped so basically this
goes against the findings that I found
before and I believe I know the reason
so running the extreme preset on 3d mark
11 basically meant that the processors
on the radio on 69
you were completely taxed so we were
creating a processor bottleneck which
meant that there didn't have to be as
much communication between the card and
the rest of the system because we
weren't able to actually we were we were
limited by how much rendering these
cores could do rather than by how
quickly the card could communicate with
the system so running at 1080p with some
modern games we were able to create a
scenario whereby new card was not
actually the bottleneck in the
performance of the system in that
particular game so the processors were
able to do more than the PCI Express
bandwidth was capable of communicating
so basically what we see here then is
that as soon as pcie 3.0 comes out we're
probably looking at a scenario remember
PCI Express is doubling in bandwidth
every time we see a new iteration but
we're probably looking at a scenario
where any modern card will perform about
like this at pcie 3.0 for X and will
perform about like this at PCIe pcie 3.0
8 X and then there will be a
hypothetical probably like incremental
0.2 fps beyond that so for any modern
card and remember this is two modern
high-end GPUs those are each 69 70s on
there for any two modern high-end GPUs
PCIe 8 X is pretty much enough and 16 X
is definitely enough based on how little
improvement we see by doubling the
bandwidth from PCIe 8x slot to 16x slot
