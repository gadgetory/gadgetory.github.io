gaming laptops that I get personally
excited about the massive power-hungry
mind-blowing ly fast super car class
ones like this dual DT X 1080 monster
from Sager that I reviewed recently and
the lightweight thin but still potent
class that seems to have emerged as a
direct response to the original razor
blade back in 2013 and this one is part
of the latter family meet the msi
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
at the link in the video description to
try it for free ok specification time
the GS 63 VR as MSI not so subtly
implied right in the name Rox on VR
ready enthusiasts grade configuration
including and Intel Core i7 6700 HQ quad
core processor 16 gigs of DDR 4 memory a
128 gig nvme SSD and a GeForce GTX 1060
with 6 gigs of gddr5 vram and as
expected they crammed all of this into
the same chassis as the GS 63 VRS gtx
970m equipped predecessor that means a
1080p 60 hertz IPS display whose deep
black levels look good but failed to
help it stand out from the crowd with
any wow features like touch higher
refresh rates or g-sync
a large speaker grille with a bottom
mounted subwoofer that both sound
decidedly ok and a 720p 30fps webcam
that falls squarely in unexceptional
territory
let's talk i/o now and I'll be making a
lot of comparisons here to my daily
driver razor blade the GS 63 VR has a
bigger screen so it's both larger though
not as much as you might think thanks to
its smaller bezels and thicker than the
razor blade but while this slightly
greater Z height means that MSI can't
take
sexy pictures of it next to dimes it
does allow it to have a built-in
Ethernet port that's one less accessory
to buy and carry around to go along with
its otherwise also fairly complete load
out including standalone the hemic 2
powered headphone and microphone jacks 3
USB 3 5 gigabit ports an SD card reader
and killer Gigabit Ethernet on the left
with a power button USB 2 weird right
USB type-c Thunderbolt HDMI 2.0 and mini
DisplayPort 1.2 on the right which I
guess leads to my first complaint I get
that MSI is dedicating
pretty much the entire back third of
this notebook two cooling vents but the
effect that this has on mousing space is
not a desirable one the power brick
thankfully terminates in a right angle
connector but if you were to plug in oh
I don't know an external Thunderbolt
Drive or an external monitor of some
sort expecting to use the included
keyboard you'd likely find yourself
pretty annoyed by how much room you have
for your mouse which leads then to
complete number two the GS 63 VRS power
brick delivers 10 percent more power
than razor's brick while being way
bigger this isn't important on massive
gaming beasts where I generally don't
even mention them unless they come with
2 or something like that but it's the
kind of thing for a machine that you
expect to carry around every day maybe
in a briefcase that actually matters
because the must-carry accessories are
part of the whole package and since I'm
on a bit of a complained roll here let's
talk bloatware why is winzip on here
Norton really and what the hell is
magics there was so much junk pre-loaded
on this thing that I had no idea to whom
my super angry letter about the 100% CPU
usage reporting bug should be addressed
I thought maybe the culprit was the
killer networking suite but removing
that didn't help the Windows 10
anniversary update didn't help and even
after a factory reset the behavior
persisted so I emailed the manufacturer
turns out it is a feature of dragon
suite that fools Windows intentionally
to keep it from entering a lower power
state to speed up data transfers over
SATA and dot 2 and USB I am oh that
should be disabled by default and come
with a warning when you turn it on
because I spent about an hour tearing my
hair out trying to fix it anyway though
the good news is that was a simple
software toggle and the rest of that
stuff can be fixed with a good old
fashioned add/remove programs purged so
I'm going to get back into the hardware
now the keyboard is RGB with three
lighting zones and SteelSeries engine
software to handle your macro and key
rebinding needs
having a number pad again is
but I'm still going to give the keyboard
of B it is quiet but I personally prefer
a sharper tactile bump even so though
with a little less deck flex and
function up/down arrow reassigned to
page up and page down instead of
brightness up and brightness down I
would increase that to a B+ with the
touchpad falling into a pretty similar
category two-handed operation works like
a charm and the surface feels good but I
really don't like their acceleration
algorithm and the Elan software doesn't
offer much in the way of tuning options
out of the box let's move on to
performance when Luke said at the GTX 10
series notebook GPU launch event that he
was disappointed they wouldn't let him
benchmark the 1060 which he thought was
the most interesting of the bunch I
think he nailed it my points of
comparison for this video since this is
my first 10 series single GPU notebook
are the gtx 970m in my daily driver
blade 14 the last gen thin gaming GPU of
choice and the GTX 980 desktop version
in MSI gt70 2's anniversary edition and
the performance here blows me away and
it should do the same to you that in a
single generation we've cut the
difference between this and this in half
and this is all while showing off some
very impressive thermal performance it's
hard to say how much of this is thanks
to the gtx 1060 until I get some more
samples and how much is thanks to MSI's
approach to cooling which you can see
with our internal shot has them really
taking advantage of the extra area
inside the GS 63 VR with three fans and
many heat pipes on an unusual
upside-down motherboard configuration
but it works and MSI even managed to
squeeze user upgradeable sodium slots in
there they aren't easy to get at but
they're in there so this machine is
quieter than most and much cooler to the
touch than any other thin and light
gaming machine that I've used yet the
weird moleskin covering on the bottom
actually seems to help too it slows heat
transfer to your skin when you have it
resting on your laps kind of a nice
touch
and the positives keep coming battery
life ain't too shabby either one and a
half hours while running Christ
three is nothing to sneeze at
considering I didn't even crank the
brightness down so bottom line then
while Emma sighs GS 63 VR might not be
the thinnest or the smallest thin and
light gaming machine it utilizes its
extra size very well to deliver more i/o
including Thunderbolt 3 a bigger display
beefy cooling and a number pad for folks
who work as well as play and thanks to
its magnesium lithium alloy chassis it's
slightly lighter even than the razor
blade that is to say if we ignore the
obnoxious power brick while also costing
less I'm not a huge fan of the 120 gig
SSD one terabyte hard drive config in
this particular unit larger SSDs not
only hold more but they also perform
better substantially better like I
noticed it but throw a bigger SSD in
there and the GS 63 VR is a really solid
platform that will make a lot of gamers
happy but you know what isn't bloatware
