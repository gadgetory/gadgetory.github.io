yep cuz Romania giant flavor Oh giant
play buttons go in here yeah smaller
items this room is looking pretty snazzy
let's go find out definitely think I'm
stupid
let me tell you what's upstairs upstairs
we've made the biggest improvements yeah
check this out this my friends is an
Ethernet jack right there in the floor
it's like mother can magic is it yeah
the upstairs uh could have you know
cubicles or something along those lines
at some point cubicles so we've got
power internet then it finally actually
been installed at three separate points
up here other than that I think the only
change is the cushion ah which I'm going
to not put my feet on Colton is this
right on this whiteboard next to your
desk is this your plan this is my plan a
and B so there is point A to point B but
there's no line between them there's
just because they go to the company
that's because that's that's it it's
it's all open it it's whatever you want
it to be you know it's what I don't want
a 1-up box on the shelf counter window
so that's the word I was looking for -
there's no shelves where's he supposed
to put it there's nothing here Koster
requested shel Oh for heaven's sakes
well it doesn't have to eat has a
windowsill sure legs play the floor is
not storage the floor is especially not
storage what do I do the extras max and
almond cushions I don't need 300 sauce
my feet get warm happy fun day why are
you filming my feet you perv so it's
been quite a journey but I think it's
time to bid the moving vlog series idea
not to say that we will never bring back
some type of log style content since we
have definitely seen you guys asking us
for it but at this point the movie is
mostly done so we don't want to drag
this out any longer than we absolutely
have to because that generates a whole
other sort of comment on our videos I do
want to show you guys a couple little
things that we have added since the last
updates though we now have a lighting
grid hanging from the ceiling in the
warehouse so we've actually got four one
above Brandon's b-roll set which he has
yet to use as far as I can tell one
above the line is tech tip set one above
the green screen and another above the
LAN show set and the workshop and ah
I actually don't know I mean is that it
oh yeah the land show set has been
dramatically improved by adding actual
set pieces in the back same goes for the
workshop so we have actually hung things
on our on our workshop walls but you
guys have probably seen this in a
variety of videos including Luke's
fallout 4 themed you know bomb build and
all that kind of stuff we've had a lot
of people suggest that we add dedicated
streaming hardware to the land show so
that we don't have to be fumbling around
with it every week we do that's why I
get so mad because we have dedicated
hardware just breaks every week and on
that subject crunchyroll the site
designed by anime fans for anime fans it
got tons of great content over there
with some featured winter shows being
the asterisk war anti-magic Academy the
35th test platoon Mobile Suit Gundam
iron blooded orphans and haikyuu season
