up here for a big old-fashioned
Cinebench run which is pretty much the
CPU equivalent of a drag race we've got
the top performers from Intel over on
this side couple of core i7s their
latest and greatest mobile core i9 and
then this weird one from Alienware with
a desktop eight core processor that's
our current king of the hill and then
over here we've got AMD's desktop eight
core muscle car equivalent this was only
dethroned very recently along with
something really really special the asus
rog Zephyrus GA 502 is the first laptop
to hit our studio that features an AMD
mobile Rison processor the Rison 737 58
to be exact meaning that was actually
made to be used in a laptop unlike this
one so without further ado gentlemen
let's hit it and see if team red is able
to regain its place at the top of the
Cinebench leaderboard three two one go
this video is brought to you by glass
wire with glass where you can instantly
see your current and past Network

okay so our to eight core Intel's are
done our eight core AMD is done our
first core i7 is done over their second
core i7s done everyone's done but then
oh boy
is this supposed to happen yeah okay
it's not about finishing first it's
about finishing together so the GA 502
isn't super fast but that doesn't mean
that you shouldn't consider it for your
next gaming notebook because it has two
really big things going for it power
consumption and price let's dig into the
specs a little the Rison 737 50 h only
features four cores and eight threads
with a maximum speed of four gigahertz
that's kind of surprising given the way
that Intel has been pushing up mobile
core counts recently I thought that was
kind of AMD's Jam the thing is though
for a gaming machine there's actually
very little benefit to going beyond four
cores so AMD's approach ends up giving
us way more bang for the buck so this
laptop that we've got right here
equipped with a gtx 1660 TI max-q
and 16 gigs of ram comes in at only
$1,200 dang and in our testing the cpu
performed admirably i mean by admirably
I mean I wouldn't have paired it with a
more powerful graphics card or anything
but we still managed to get Triple A
games above 60 FPS at high details and
we comfortably reached 120 FPS which
matches our 120 Hertz refresh rate in
lighter and eSports titles as for use
outside of gaming we generally saw
similar performance to the Intel Core i5
8300 H so nothing amazing but our
Zephyrus GA 502 stayed cool and quiet
even when it was under full synthetic
load that doesn't mean a soos didn't
make some compromises though moving from
the inside to the outside compared to
the others emphases is that force AI
doesn't matter the Dino 502 doesn't
quite
have the same build quality not that it
needs it
it lacks visual accents like an RGB
keyboard and the chassis has a slightly
plastic ear feel but all of that is
pretty easy to forgive
since most zephyr as's cost two to three
times as much also when compared to
similarly priced competition like the
Dell g5 the GA 502 easily takes the cake
for overall look and feel like there's
basically no chassis flex furthermore
it's impressively thin for a gaming
laptop and the metal on the back of the
screen and the really thin bezels give
it a very modern look
now the screen itself is merely pretty
good but once again for the price it's
more like pretty darn good it's of the
1080p IPS variety so no fancy retina
branding here but it gets bright enough
for comfortable use in a well-lit office
and it sports a 120 Hertz refresh rate
making it generally very enjoyable to
game on and even acceptable for watching
movies and shows with the above-average
speakers adding to the experience as
well as far as connectivity goes the
Zephyrus has four USB ports one of which
is Type C along with full-sized HDMI
headphones and Ethernet which is better
than most modern devices there's no
Thunderbolt 3 mind you but you're not
gonna see that on any AMD devices for a
little while while Thunderbolt 3 makes
the transition to becoming USB for one
shortfall here though is the Wi-Fi with
just a one by one Wi-Fi five card this
thing chugs during large downloads like
it's its kind of thing you wouldn't
think would be noticeable but it
definitely is and you're gonna want to
plug into the wall whenever you're
installing a game or copying files over
the network now so far the GA 502
has been faring pretty well but where
most gaming laptops faceplant is the
trackpad and this one actually seemed
like it was going to at first like for
whatever reason
my finger kept kind of getting stuck on
it and skipping around but then after
using it for a day my hand grease
actually made it pretty nice and smooth
to use so so that's pretty gross but I
guess it also goes to show that a little
lubrication is never a bad thing and the
usability score keeps getting better the
keyboard is downright excellent no
finger Lube required it's got a snappy
short throw that easily beats out the
Dell g5 and Asus Helios 300 while still
being both comfortable and quiet now as
I mentioned before it doesn't have an
RGB backlight but it is still backlit
which is a lot of help if you're working
on assignments at night and you're not a
comfortable touch typist and there's
more good news for the slow typists out
there the 76 watt hour battery gave us
close to five hours on a single charge
in our standard test now that's not an
amazing result compared to a low-power
ultrabook but it's way better than
similar gaming laptops and well beyond
the threshold of usable so I can't
really complain what I will complain
about though asus is where the holy hell
is the webcam i really hope that you
guys figure out how to get a webcam in a
small bezel laptop sooner rather than
later
I mean Dell did it I'm gonna get real
sick of telling you guys that
no webcam at all is in fact worse than
having a bad or even a poorly positioned
webcam the thing that makes this really
difficult though
is that you guys are never going to
learn if I don't stop recommending your
bloody devices like honestly even even
this would be better I think actually no
I'm not sure that that would be better
back to the recommendation there's no
getting around it for me if you guys are
looking for a somewhat budget oriented
gaming laptop you should go grab a
zephyrus GA 502 so that's all there is
to it and a video right no not quite yet
cuz here's a big question why is it that
AMD was able to so effectively crush the
Intel competition in this market segment
well as it turns out this is less of a
win for AMD and more of a colossal screw
up from Intel
so when OEMs are specking out their
systems Intel will offer kickbacks if
one of their higher-end processors like
a core i7 gets used even if that
processor doesn't make a ton of sense
for the rest of the configuration so if
you were ever wondering what is up with
those weird laptops where the CPU power
vastly outstrips the GPU that's what's
been going on here because in many cases
a quad core Core i5 is gonna keep up
with a 16-6 TTI or even up to a 20 70
max Q and it'll do it at a lower price
but Intel's branding strategy is leaving
this giant hole in the market that AMD
has filled quite tightly here simply by
allowing laptops with their processors
in them to be Specht in a way that makes
sense for gamers this just in at
Computex 2019 laptops are revealed from
Dell and Lenovo featuring I 5 processors
and 1660 T is seemingly in response to
an B's pressure at this price point now
this news does not change a
recommendation of the GA 502 but it's
still very exciting and gives consumers
extra options now back to you Linus so
once again
AMD's return to competitiveness is a win
for consumers so I say why not celebrate
by picking up a sensible gaming laptop
at the link in the video description and
while you're down there why not check
out this plate this plate is a magnet
mounted metal print that's durable and
doesn't require any power tools to hang
it they've got over 26 tens of thousands
just over a quarter million different
arts spanning a bunch of different
styles and influences and with their
easy magnetic mounting there are no
holes in the wall and it's easily
replaceable they plant 10 trees for
every display purchased and you can use
code LTT to save 15% at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
guys if you disliked you know where that
