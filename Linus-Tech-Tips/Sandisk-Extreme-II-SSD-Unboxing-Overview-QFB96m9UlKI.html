unboxings anymore they're pretty much
the same as far as this thing that's
inside the box and what it looks like
but I've had at least a few people
asking me about SanDisk SSDs for quite
some time and I was mildly curious about
whether a nonce and force based SSD
would work in the Blackmagic Cinema
Camera that we're planning to purchase
in spite of there not being any nonce
and four-faced SSDs on the validated
list so first let's start with ten disk
SSDs in general they're not exactly you
know an enthusiast type brand from me
from a gamers a typical gamers
perspective you might look at Santa's
can go okay well that stuff that like
you know camera people use whereas you
know I'm going for like ocz or whatever
else but for professional users speaking
of what camera people might use they are
definitely an enthusiast grade brands so
their SD cards and compact flash cards
traditionally have been among the
fastest in fact they have the fastest SD
card available in terms of sustained
write speeds at the moment with
Blackmagic specifically recommending
their Extreme Pro Series for raw
recording on the Blackmagic pocket
camera so there you go they own fabs
which gives them the luxury of being
able to handpick the absolute best flash
for themselves this equates to both an
endurance and a performance advantage
and aside from using their own flash on
here which is an advantage they're using
a Marga very fast Marvel controller and
their own custom firmware to achieve
performance that is at or near the top
of pretty much every performance
benchmark you can possibly find inside
the box I guess I should have mentioned
that there's an ESD bag there's the SSD
that itself it's a seven millimeter SSD
and it comes with a spacer so you can
space it out to nine millimeters if your
particular notebook supports that form
factor as opposed to the slimmer one and
I guess that's all there is to really
say about it of course you'll pay a
premium for this and any extreme
performance I mean it says extreme like
right on the box this and any extreme
performance SSD but whether or not it's
worth the extra cost to you these days
particularly if you're coming from a
hard drive which is so much
lower than even the slowest SSD is
probably open for debate if you are a
professional user and you do need very
good longevity it comes with a five year
warranty and you need extreme supreme
performance and all that stuff then I
guess it's not really that debatable
you're probably gonna want to go for
something like this at any rate it's
available in 120 gig 240 gig and 40 gig
configurations as usual this is
something I should probably mention just
because nobody seems to know this you
can find the pricing of pretty much
anything I unbox by checking out the
pricing and availability link and the
video description I think that's pretty
much it guys like the video if you liked
it dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment and let me know your thoughts on
the video if they're more complicated
than this or this and as always don't
