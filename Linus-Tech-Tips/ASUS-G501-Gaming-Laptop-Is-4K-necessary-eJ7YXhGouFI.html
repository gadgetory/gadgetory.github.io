notebooks around here everything from a
Seuss's monster gee 750 series gaming
beasts to our upcoming MacBook 2015
video but today's gaming laptop the g5
oh one is not about extremes but rather
balanced trying to find the perfect
middle ground has a soos done it well I
guess we'll find out
Kingston kc3 ten series business great
SSDs feature firmware based power loss
protection massive capacities and
performance to spare in fact we're using
them for our new production server click
right here to learn more about them so
if I'm going to make a statement like
this is a you know balanced laptop I
guess I'd better back it up objectively
right under the hood our machine is
kitted out with the core i7 4720 HQ
that's typical of mobile gaming rigs
these days 16 gigs of ram so plenty but
not overkill a 15.6 inch display size
squarely between the 14 inch blade 14
and a 17 inch monster like the GS 70
from msi a gtx 960m with 4 gigs of VRAM
that lives squarely between entry-level
discrete graphics and the legitimately
high-end 970 and 980 and I guess I
probably sound like a broken record by
now which like a broken record by now
which like a broken record by now which
like a broken record by now which but I
digress the G 501 does have some things
that really set it apart from the crowd
first and foremost the config I have in
front of me is equipped with a 512 gig
PCIe 4x based SSD that I've nicknamed
the wrecker next up is the i/o on the
front we've got these kind of neato
indicator LEDs on the back is just
ventilation on the right we find nothing
of note a three-and-a-half millimeter
combo Jack an SD card reader and two USB
3.0 ports then on the Left we find
nothing of note again will it on a
second line is why did you say the i/o
was exceptional ah there's a mislabeled
port here that's a USB 3.0 port an HDMI
port a standard power in and a
Thunderbolt 20 gigabit per second port
disguised as a mini DisplayPort port
it's a feature with very little
relevance to many users but one that
could be a key selling point for
creative pros who use Thunderbolt in
their daily lives and finally we've got
the display I mentioned the size but I
specifically didn't mention anything
else at the beginning of the video now
it wasn't long ago that every gaming
laptop had some
of poop tastic 1080p TN panel in it not
today
and while maximum brightness is not as
high as I personally like to see the IPS
display in the G 501 manages the higher
contrast and great viewing angles that
I've come to expect with a 3840 by 2160
Ultra HD native resolution to boot so
let's take the rest of the physical tour
then shall we build qualities again what
I would describe as high to mid-range
although a couple of years ago it would
be somewhere between very good and
exemplary which goes to show how far
we've come with a brushed aluminum top
cover sporting a shiny ASIS and slightly
less shiny but definitely more red our
og logo a similar brushed aluminum base
that can be removed to reveal the single
upgradable BIM slot to complement the
four or eight gigs of solder DRAM and a
solid blasted anodized aluminum unibody
style keyboard and touchpad surface that
would have combined with a bezel made of
anything other than plastic pushed the
device into outstanding craftsmanship
territory if it didn't have quite so
much give to it when I press down or
rest my wrists on it the trackpad is
again average it's unfortunately not
blast which is what makes it sort of not
premium but the good news is it does
feature a pretty satisfying plastic
surface and on the keyboard travel
distance is good although that is
something that's admittedly easier on a
laptop like this rather than on a super
hyper slim one like that you know 2015
MacBook but I did find the backlight
brightness a little low and the tactile
bump could be less mushy the really good
news though is that there were no
cardinal sins committed in the layout
and while I personally prefer home end
page up and page down to be bound to
function in the arrow keys versus their
slightly inconvenient or altogether
absent location in the top right the
inclusion of a number pad and proper up
and down arrow keys at all is great if
you're a Productivity minded person who
also wants to game a bit but this is
where we get into the first unbalanced
aspect of the G 501s configuration
the gtx 960m GPU is just plain not
suitable for gaming at 4k like at all
it's very unusual for me to say in this
case I think downgrading the spec would
have been just plain better but a 1080p
IPS panel with great contrast and a bit
more brightness would have actually been
preferable for me in this case now you
can simply run it at 1080p in games as I
did in these comparative benchmarks
versus the Razer Blade 14 2015 which
gives us an idea of how the 960m
compares to the 970m but if you're going
to do all your gaming at 1080p in the
first place then the question is why not
just use an HD display anyway which I
guess leads pretty well onto the whole
who is the g5 oh one made for
conversation as a gaming device it
delivers a good experience better than
the vast majority of last generation
gaming laptops even ones with much
thicker profiles but actually it's its
general-purpose mobile computer utility
that's more likely to sell it to folks
who are shopping for a new laptop since
its battery life for productivity was
great compared to most gaming machines
and it can actually game a bit so the
bottom line is this I compared it to the
Razer Blade 14 2015 for a couple of
reasons number one is that I happen to
use that as my daily driver so the
comparison is convenient and number two
is that at its old price of $2000 the g5
oh one was actually somewhat price
competitive with the blade 14 making it
a pretty tough sell from a performance
and construction perspective but at the
new price not to mention the included
Mouse and headset the conclusion
actually changes a lot and now for
someone looking for a good looking
laptop that delivers great usability for
productivity and a good if not exemplary
gaming experience the g5 oh one becomes
a quiet cool running compelling value as
long as you don't mind spending 20
minutes removing the unnecessary
bloatware seriously a Seuss I just
bought your laptop I don't need like an
A Seuss gift box like deals app are you
real look at this thing
takes forever to load alright so that's
pretty much it guys like the video if
you liked it dislike it if you thought
it sucked leave a comment preferably at
