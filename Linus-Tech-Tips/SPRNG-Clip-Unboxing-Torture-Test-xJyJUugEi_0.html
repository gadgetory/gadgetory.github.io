blogs the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it so Linus is away for a while and
while he was gone he wanted us to do a
video about the spring clip he wants to
do an unboxing and while this won't be a
traditional unboxing because to be
honest I've lost the box and in addition
to not having the box we decided to do
tests to them as well so essentially the
spring clip is an add-on to your Apple
earpods which helps it sit inside your
ear without moving so it just goes into
ear right like that and then basically
while you're out and about it won't
really jostle around in your ear at all
and it'll keep its position much better
so we decided to do with them to see if
their claims were true was actually
benchmark them in a sense so what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna go for a run then
we're gonna roll down a hill and then
I'm gonna get tackled really really hard
by my roommate in this benchmark of
sorts we're gonna have three different
contestants the first is going to be a
random generic pair of earbuds the
second will be Apple's ear pod by
themself and the third will be Apple's
ear pod with the spring clip for the
running tests the results were a little
bit expected so the black ones jostled a
little bit and if I ran for much longer
would have came completely out I have
this problem fairly regularly it's one
of the reasons why I don't like earbuds
the Apple earpods stayed in fairly well
but did move a little bit and the ear
pods with spring didn't really seem to
move at all now the rolling test well
maybe not realistic some people might be
rolling down hills all the time the
random generic black in ears completely
failed and we're both out of my ear by
the end of the test the Apple earpods
had moved a lot but we're both still in
my ears for sure and the Apple earpods
was spring moved a very small amount and
we're still definitely in my ears the
tackle test surprised me a little bit I
expected pretty much everything to fail
this and I expected the spring to maybe
make it and but probably still fail and
that wasn't the result at all they
actually all stayed in my ear including
the generic ones they just moved quite a
bit the generic ones were barely still
in my ear and would have fallen out
they actually one of them fell out as I
stood up the ear pods moved a lot but
stayed in my ear and the spring moved a
little bit but still did stay in my ear
now our testing wasn't exactly
scientific but I wanted to show you guys
some sort of tangible result and I hope
my comments after each test helped
you have an informed decision on buying
these products now it's it's not
necessarily for me I'm not going to use
your paw I don't have ear pods but if I
did have ear pods I wouldn't be using
them that much so it wouldn't be
something I'd necessarily be that
interested in but if you're gonna use
them all the time and it's something
you're interested in that's great if
you've liked the video like it if you
dislike the video dislike it that's no
problem and please comment on the video
