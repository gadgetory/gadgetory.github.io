Bluetooth headphones created a hole that
most consumers didn't know they needed
filled and as always spawned a plethora
of imitators who promised to do the same
thing without being overpriced but are
the air pods overpriced or compared to
the other products in the market are
they better enough to justify the Apple
tax well folks I've got eight pairs of
Bluetooth headphones with me to help us
get to the bottom of this
the new master keys proem RGB and pro s
white from coolermaster are coming soon
check out their lineup at the link below
let's meet our contestants shall we
wow that's a lot protip by the way you
can watch videos at half speed with the
button down there the air pods are going
to be our baseline so we'll start with
them they've got a striking look that
for better or for worse lets everybody
know just how much you love Apple they
come in a lightweight charging case that
feels fantastic in the hand and they
pair effortlessly with your iPhone or
even other devices with a couple more
steps I would put their sound on the
tinny side and the sound stage is a bit
narrow but the articulation is good and
there's enough bass present that most
people honestly will be happy with them
battery life comes in at 5 hours of
continuous listening plus four to five
quick charges from the included dock
compare all of that to the dash from
braggy
the only earphones in our lineup that
are actually more expensive than Apple's
but should they be they're comfortable
they're reasonably light and
subjectively they look a little cooler
than the air pods - and the sound is
better as well with big bass and a full
sound and they even pack some cool extra
tech in like the air pods they can pause
when you pull them out but wait there's
more they have onboard storage and our
waterproof so you can swim with them
while listening to music they have a
touch interface for taking calls and
controlling media playback and they even
function as a fitness tracker though
especially those last two don't work
particularly well leading us into the
cons the big two our range James didn't
experience it but I've had issues with
signal drops while holding my phone in
my pocket and the high noise floor it
sounds like I in the background and it's
a big issue if you listen at relatively
low volumes battery life is also kind of
met
three to four hours+ four to five
charges from the case sounds okay on
paper but in practice the bulky and
heavy charging case is much less
convenient to carry around than Apple's
Jaybirds freedom sound quality beats
most of the competitors in this review
pretty soundly bass is strong and you'll
hear things you wouldn't if you were
listening to the same song with the air
pods they're lightweight and while you
might think that having your phones
connected by a wire is maybe less
premium I don't personally mind it with
the wire behind your neck it's very
unlikely to get in the way and you'll
get to keep in line controls which can
plug into a little charging clip to
extend freedoms battery life from an
advertised four hours to eight it's easy
to pop in you're out and there's no way
to lose one of the earphones the only
real drawback is that they're pretty
pricey as well the actio atom gets some
style marks for the ability to offer
your friends an earphone like it's the
1930s and smoking is still cool but
while it's fully wireless which is neat
it gets some significant points against
it two and a half hours is too often to
be recharging in my opinion even if you
can do it up to 18 times in a row and
the case also functions as a battery
bank just cool the pairing process is
relatively complicated and the
multi-purpose button doesn't work for
track skipping play pause and phone
calls only with that said they are
reasonably comfortable as long as the
ear tips don't stay stuck in your canals
and actually sound pretty decent I'm
tempted to say they sound better than
the air pods because of their deeper
bass expanded soundstage and reduced
tininess but your mileage may vary
because the hi-hats in one of our metal
test songs sounded absolutely abominable
I was actually embarrassed to wear the
boots by smart homie or as I'll be
calling them the Shrek ears in public
they are lightweight and reasonably
comfortable but never felt quite right
due to their size I would rate their
sound as may be comparable to the air
pods but a little distant sounding and
turning the volume loud can actually
make you wince the hallmark of bad
earphones so what do they have going for
them then well you can access Siri by
double tapping the onboard buttons and
the battery life is solid there's no
charging case but they lasted a full
five and a half hours in my test not too
shabby
but I can't say the same about these
they're the worst ones of the bunch the
Apple err Twinkies also known as the day
comes from tws again I did not leave my
house with these on during testing
because they actually look like an
intentionally comical parody of the real
thing and not only do they look like hot
dogs coming out of your ears they pretty
much sound and feel like it too
they have no punch no bass
over-pronounce ties they have a horrible
pairing process the positions in the
charge case are reversed from when you
take them out of your ears and they
never really felt like they were in your
ears so I didn't wear them long enough
to find out how long the battery lasts
because I don't care they're awful
fortunately the downward price/quality
spiral ends here the $50.00 axe geo -
earphones are my favorite budget pair of
the bunch
I even like them more than the $99 Axio
Adams they pair more easily had physical
buttons for pausing track skipping and
even volume control and even have longer
battery life at three hours meanwhile
the sound quality is just as good as the
Adams but with arguably more bass and I
would rather listen to these than the
air pods and although I thought they
would be heavy and look stupid they're
not and I don't think they do if you're
on a tight budget and don't need a
charge in case the Axio - are worth a
look and would be my undisputed budget
pick if it weren't for the aki EP B
force so cheap they don't even seem to
appear on LG's website they're light
they're comfortable and believe it or
not they sound comparable to the air
pods but with strikingly bigger bass the
poor build quality can make the volume
rocker and other
a little difficult to use but hey the
functionality is there my only gripe is
the L Dante pasta noodle connecting the
two phones that makes you look and feel
a bit like a dad on a safari
but aesthetics aside these things punch
way above their weight class their low
price and five hour battery life makes
them a perfect pick to throw in the gym
bag or ski jacket so trophy time if you
want great sounding wireless earphones
that you can listen to all day it's hard
to go wrong with something from j-bird
the freedoms we covered here or they're
blue buds line which we've covered in
more detail before if you want to ball
on a budget then go for the axe geo - or
the Aki EPB force but if you want a
polished experience and I am Oh
fantastic industrial design with
seamless switching between your Apple
devices the air pods are there for you
considering what else is out there
they're not that bad just for the love
of all that is good don't don't get the
err Twinkies look at these things can
you think of a cool product or online
service that would make sense to

out of them all right let's do it nice
look at he's not even he's gonna be
stuck in that hole nope let's go or we
go
let us know what do you guys want to see
advertised online is tech tips so thanks
for watching guys if you liked like if
you dislike dislike if you really liked
get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured in the video description also
down there is our community forum at a
place where you can buy cool merch and
