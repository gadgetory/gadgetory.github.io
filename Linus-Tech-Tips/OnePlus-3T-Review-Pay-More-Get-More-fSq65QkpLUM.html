videos I put my sim in the latest shiny
gadget fire it up and I start taking
notes on all the little things that jump
out of the screen and make me sit up and
take notice a strategy that really
doesn't work as well when you're
basically reviewing the same phone for
the second time
but is the one plus 3t the same phone
but at a higher price or like an Apple S
refresh have they added enough to make
it worth sitting through my video again
well there's only one way to find out by
sitting through my video again
are you looking for a new gaming desktop
or laptop check out I by powers Black
Friday deals which include dozens of
free upgrades at the link in the video
description physical tour time if you've
never seen a one plus three the t other
than replacing the graphite color with
gunmetal looks identical from the
outside at the back is the oneplus logo
a flash a camera bump a noise cancelling
mic and a couple of racing stripe I mean
antenna lines on the right is the dual
SIM tray and one of my biggest
complaints about the three T the easy to
accidentally press lock button directly
opposing the on the right volume rocker
and notification mode switch that I
didn't use much my first time around
with the three but actually started to
really like this time I don't know if
it's a new feature of Android wear but
my watch actually tells me what mode
it's in in real time on the top of the
screen so I never forget that I'm in
silent mode anymore one of the reasons I
never use silent mode then on the bottom
is the USB to speed - charging type-c
connector a grill for the single speaker
though now that Apple has implemented
dual speakers through the earpiece
hopefully that'll show up in the four
and every other phone from now on and I
had phone jack which I hope doesn't go
away for that same industry follows
Apple reason then around front are a
couple of my favorite things about the
three T but also the three no changes
here the Gorilla Glass 4 covered 1080p
AMOLED display it's bright performs
admirably in direct sunlight doesn't
waste GPU power on pixels that no one
will be able to see from further than
four inches away and comes calibrated
for a neutral natural look rather than
an oversaturated one and the
lightning-fast fingerprint reading touch
home button flanked by built-in
capacitive buttons which can easily be
swapped in software if you prefer back
on the right side or on the left or
disabled outright if you prefer
on-screen buttons which I am pretty much
a
over at this point but your mileage may
vary internally more though it's still
not much has changed the Snapdragon 820
CPU has been replaced by an 821 also
with an Adreno 530 GPU this is not an
architectural or manufacturing process
update just a clock speed bump then for
the heavy users oneplus has stuffed a
3400 milliamp hour battery into the same
size chassis without adding any weight
very nice the camera is the same which
is actually a good thing it's low light
performance is excellent so is its high
light performance shutter speed launch
time by the way everyone should have
double-click to launch because it is
freaking awesome and it's under the hood
options are great with raw capture
available for the shutter bugs and
tweakers then you've got 6 gigs of
lpddr4 memory a 128 gig non expandable
option instead of just 64 and it's all
running on a slightly updated android
marshmallow though it should be noted
that most if not all of the enhancements
here are also coming to the 3 this
includes the updated quick access icons
in the status bar a way to fingerprint
protect apps though it didn't really
come up for me a call blocker blacklist
is bewildering to me that this is a day
base Android feature with cloud
synchronization at this point and a
nuclear all mode that wipes out
background processes to they'll use it
with caution because sure your CPU usage
will go down but you might stop getting
notifications and stuff so what isn't
coming to the three good question a
higher price for one the 3t is being
sold alongside the three as a more
premium model for four hundred and forty
bucks for a 64 gig or 480 if you want
the 128 this is basically oneplus bowing
to the realities of competing in the
flagship smartphone market by hiking
prices again just like they've done
every generation to cover presumably the
costs of extra marketing customer
support supporting more colors and
capacities and the like also you get the
better 16
pixal selfie camera I mean I don't
personally take a lot of selfies but
it's performance is noticeably better
very good and the smile to capture mode
would probably work really well if you
were trying to take selfies not with
your children for whom waiting three
seconds for a countdown timer would be
some kind of Christmas miracle which
leaves us pretty well into customization
some stuff oneplus does really well here
being able to make my Google bar clear
or white being able to nickname apps on
the homescreen three-finger swipe
screenshots so cool and having better
control over power saver features all
resulted in real experiential
improvements battery life on the 3t is
excellent even with all my crap loaded
on it I couldn't burn it in a single day
but they still miss some basic stuff
digging deep enough I found some poorly
translated English in the settings menu
and some more customization options are
still needed why can I turn on the
flashlight or pause media by drawing on
the blank screen but I can't bind those
functions to a double press of a button
like I can with other functions and why
can't I launch an app via either of
these means finally why oh why can't I
set up a five wide grid of home screen
icons with the default launcher which I
like and want to use I don't know but
these are minor complaints and the one
plus 3t thanks to Google's decision to
abandon their low price strategy way
back with the Nexus 5 and price the
pixel like an iPhone means that even at
a slightly higher price it is still very
competitive
it's a shockingly easy to hold five and
a half inch phone that performs well
here's a real world look at their
supposed faster app launch speed
compared to the s7 by the way and just
feels quality in the hand highly
recommended just like last time and it's
time for another mass drop spa mass drop
they take lots of buyers and they take
lots of sellers and they put them
together they sell whoo
or you buy for cheaper everybody gets a
good deal and today's feature drop is
the monk plus blue from venture
electronics really they actually sound
surprisingly good like shockingly good
for the price just the thing that's
confusing to me is that they're only 5
bucks so I'm really not sure how mass
drop is going to recoup the money
they're spending on this advertising
spot that they're buying right now but I
guess that's not my problem and it's not
yours either so check them out at the
link in the video description to get
your hands on a pair of earbuds that
sound far better than what you get at
the dollar store but are cheap enough
that you can basically treat them like
they're disposable if you're one of
those scatterbrain people who often
loses your earbuds so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
check out the link to where to buy the
stuff we featured it down there's a do
they have this at Amazon well whatever
we'll have a link to where to buy in the
video description also linked down
there's our merch store which has closed
shirts like this one in our community
forum which you should totally join now
that you're done doing all that stuff
you're probably wondering gee which I've
watched next oh maybe that video rate up
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
