it's time for another ultimate build
guide this time it's going to be the
ultimate video editing workstation so
we're going to be walking you through
the mechanics of putting the system
together but more importantly we're
going to be talking about the rationale
behind each of the parts we chose as
well as giving you a couple of other
options because for professional use
there are often at least a half a dozen
options that would all be valid for any
given part depending on your particular
needs
like most rigs a professional video
editing machine starts at the cpu now
our cpu choice is not the only choice we
went with the 49 30 K on the LGA 2011
platform and we did this for a number of
reasons we found the 49 30 K to be a
good sweet spot it's the lowest end six
core processor that's available from the
core i7 family we could step down to a
48 20k but then we'd be losing a couple
of cores even though it is less
expensive or we could step up to a 49 60
X Extreme Edition but we wouldn't be
getting a lot more performance and we'd
be paying quite a bit more for it Zeon's
are also options but from a price to
performance standpoint we didn't find
that for our rig bearing in mind that
Adobe can be easily offloaded without
even buying additional licenses to a
render farm we didn't find we needed
even more processing cores or more than
64 gigs of ram which would be another
benefit of a xeon processor support for
ECC memory now benefit number two beyond
having more cores of choosing the LGA
2011 platform is more PCI Express Lanes
these are pcie 3.0 lanes and it has
about double the lane support of the
consumer-grade platform meaning that as
you add in bandwidth hungry expansion
cards like accelerator cards and raid
cards and Knick cards and graphics cards
and anything that you want compute cards
whatever kind of crazy stuff you might
want to put on here you need to make
sure that band what's available and only
a professional-grade platform will have
that benefit number three is more RAM
support even using consumer grade
modules such as these corsair dominator
Platinum's these are clocked at 21 33
megahertz we can get up to 64 gigs of
ram in this board which is more
we need for our application although
it'll be up to you guys to decide
whether you need more than that that you
might end up with something like a dual
socket board with even more memory slots
or high-density ECC modules now let's
talk a little bit more about the memory
we went with ddr3 2133 modules so
remember we did a showcase a little
while ago where we demonstrated that
anything of round 1333 or higher doesn't
benefit gaming applications however with
pro applications where you're swapping
massive amounts of data in and out of
the memory that can be a bit of a
different scenario with that said you
still want to find a sweet spot and you
don't necessarily want to spring for
ddr3 3,000 megahertz or anything like
that so we found 2133 was a good balance
now why did we go with this particular
kitten really a big part of the answer
is not all memory kits are available in
8 way configurations so first of all you
have to be able to get a quad channel
kit of whatever memory it is there's a
chance that two dual channel kits will
work together in quad channel but if you
want maximum compatibility buying quad
channel kits is the way to go remember
LGA 2011 not only supports more memory
but also about double the theoretical
bandwidth of LGA 1150 so we had to find
a quad channel kit then we wanted to
find a quad channel kit that actually
has all eight modules in one kit all
validated together because this again
improves compatibility with your
motherboard and CPU and is makes it less
likely that you're going to run into any
issues down the road you want a 6 core
processor and 64 gigs of RAM you're
going to need a board that supports that
this is the p9 X 79 EWS from a soos and
don't let the ws fool you it's not just
suitable for workstation use guys so if
you want to overclock or game on this
board yeah that'll be just fine don't
worry but what makes it ws well number
one is there's the pure quality of the
components it is an extremely well-built
board it is designed to be used in a
professional environment and yes those
components do cost more and they do last
longer next up is the expansion so check
this out
seven PCI Express 16x physical slots
three of them are wired for 8x four of
them are wired for PCIe six
neck's 3.0 that's supported by that ivy
bridge-e processor Wow lots of expansion
you've also got eight ddr3 module slots
so that will support up to 64 gigs a
regular non-ecc memory with a normal
core series processor or you can support
even more if you step up to a Xeon
processor which will cost you a little
bit more and then you'll spend a little
bit more on the memory as well to get
even more rock-solid stability and even
better performance now it's got other
workstation oriented features as well
such as the dual Intel NICs at the back
that increases throughput and decreases
CPU utilization when you're working off
of network resources but that is not
actually where it really shows its value
compatibility is where this board shows
its value you could spend half as much
less than half as much on a motherboard
that would give you the same performance
yes I'm gonna let that sink in for a
moment
less than half as much so why doesn't
everyone just do that because when
you're buying a professional-grade
product you expect zero downtime when
you buy a new red rocket accelerator
card and throw it into your board you
expect it to work you don't expect to
find out that there's a compatibility
issue and you've got to pull that
motherboard eBay it flip it somehow buy
a new one and replace it you can't
afford that if you want something that
you know is going to work this is it
friends WS Series boards are validated
to a much higher standard with
aftermarket parts than other boards
whether it is the aforementioned red
rocket card RAID cards multi-channel
NICs or whatever else you can fill up
these PCI Express slots Xeon Phi's
cuadros Tesla's it's all validated in
this board so if you can't afford the
downtime and you're willing to pay an
extra premium for that and you just want
what I generally consider to be the best
single socket board on the market P 9x
79 EWS my friends we went with a pro
grade product for the motherboard but
for the power supply we're going with a
bit of more of a gaming branded product
why would that be well for one thing the
Corsair ax I Series comes with a seven
year warranty so if you had any doubts
as to how well-built they are there's
that you can also check out the reviews
on Johnny guru con these are extremely
well-built power supplies right up there
with a workstation grade power supply
and make
with a seven-year warranty and they come
with course our link which allows you to
monitor its usage as well as its
efficiency as well as your voltage
levels and all that crazy stuff so we
kind of went well what's the real
difference between this and a
workstation power supply well there's
the brand name on the front which isn't
terribly important to us and there's the
fact that it doesn't look like an
industrial piece of equipment and sound
like an industrial piece of equipment
it's very very quiet to go along with
that 80-plus platinum efficiency so
there doesn't appear to be a downside we
went with the ax 860 I now there's a
million different options in terms of
storage there really are literally a
million but we're going to walk you
through what we went with SSD boot drive
I still feel is the most important thing
to have in any machine gaming
workstation it doesn't really matter
and for us we went with the Intel 530
series 240 gig drive it's got a
five-year warranty so they're standing
behind it in terms of the reliability
the durability of the flash you could
spend a lot more and get something like
a 3500 series drive that would be an
option but because we're not going to be
using this drive for any of the real
work we're not using it as a scratch
disc we're not using it to actually
store any HD footage on it we're just
basically reading off of it we did not
feel it was necessary to go with a probe
raid component in this case when working
with HD video files or even Ultra HD
video files you will need a ton of space
we wanted to try and keep our storage
internal to make this workstation as as
portable as possible without tying us
down to an external storage array so we
went with 4 WD black 4 terabyte drives
we're going to be running them in raid
10 we're going to be running them off
the on-board raid these are not
necessarily the only options available
to you adding in a high end raid card so
that you can run something like raid 5
very quickly or some kind of an unread
or some kind of a raid 6 these are
definitely options but by the time you
buy a raid card that's capable of
running those types of raid fast enough
for professional usage you're probably
looking at adding another 500 to a
thousand dollars to the cost of the
build so I wanted to present that option
but that
not something that we went with raid10
allows us to take our 4 4 terabyte
drives and get a total of 8 terabytes of
fast safe storage we get the benefits of
raid 0 so that is double the sequential
throughput and we get the benefits of
raid 1 which means that we can have any
one of the drives in the system fail and
up to 2 of the drives in the system fail
before any data losses incurred this is
so important for professional work
whether you're running a raid card
whether you're running raid off of your
on board or whether you're running some
kind of an external enclosure whether
that's network or USB 3 or eSATA or
whatever the case may be
redundancy is key it is not a substitute
for backing up preferably off-site but
redundancy will save you from a hardware
failure choosing a graphics card for a
professional rig is a very personal
choice and I just want you guys to maybe
be able to make a better educated one
even if I can't tell you exactly what's
right for you now graphics cards in
general have always had the hardware
oomph to be great for applications like
video editing but the software is still
catching up so prior to Adobe cs5 for
example if you're a premiere editor
anyone telling you you needed a great
workstation graphics card for better
video editing performance was probably
trying to sell you a great workstation
graphics card that ultimately wasn't
going to be doing a whole lot for you in
terms of performance anyway with cs5
that all changed so we're able to
leverage that highly parallelized
processor the onboard memory the fast
interconnects to the rest of the system
for wholesale changes to individual
pixels imagine a graphics card being
good for that such as a color correction
scaling or compositing so that was with
cs5 now we're actually continuing to
improve so for example in After Effects
in cs6 the optics ray-tracing engine was
added that's GPU accelerated as well so
that instead of fake kludge III D FX and
After Effects now editors can work in
real 3d with real depth values now on
the Nvidia side alone you've actually
got options in terms of you've got two
whole different lines of graphics cards
to choose from so there's quad rose
which I was waving around before the
workstation grade cards
then there's also the consumer-grade
geforce cards now what geforce cards do
is they offer a great price to
performance ratio if you're looking for
sheer CUDA cores and CUDA performance if
the application that you're running
doesn't call for a specifically
validated GPU or there's no easy hack
geforce cards offer great bang for the
buck now with that said they don't
undergo the same degree of validation
because there's a whole lot of variety
in the implementations from different
manufacturers so that means that you've
got to make a pretty careful choice for
which one you don't want to go with the
Asus direct Cu 2 GTX 780 that we've got
for our rig is an over build card
it's overclocked but you know not crazy
like it's going to die immediately or
anything like that and it has a
fantastic cooler on it so we'd expect it
to have a very long life cycle even
though it's not rated for 24/7 operation
the same way that something like a
Quadro is with Quadro cards on the other
hand performance takes a definite
backseat to validation and reliability
the things that workstation users value
the most these cards are all built by
Nvidia with exactly the same components
every time allowing large corporations
to validate particular workloads of
particular machines with this particular
card and no that is going to be
available in exactly that configuration
over a long period of time this is
important in a corporate environment but
not necessarily something that
individual users value now that goes for
software makers as well this is less of
an issue with Adobe software where they
actually do validate some geforce chips
and configurations in addition to Quadro
configurations but avid for example only
certifies workstation grade cards for
their avid software now with that said
there are hacks there are text file
hacks for both adobe applications and
for avid that allow you to you know plug
in geforce cards and and allow them to
be recognized as validated cards but
this is a very a very homebrew way of
approaching it and not everyone is
comfortable with that now for the
multi-talented Video Editor who also
does some 3d rendering work as well
you'll probably just plain-old need a
Quadro card professional 3d rendering
applique
such as 3ds Max and Maya are often only
going to work with GPU acceleration with
Quadro cards this is because of the way
that the Quadro driver is architected to
specifically enable performance profiles
and compatibility settings even down to
if that particular rendering application
is the active window on the screen it's
making optimizations in the background
for the utmost compatibility and the
GeForce drivers just aren't tuned to
operate that way they're going for balls
to the walls performance rather than
that stability and validation that
Quadro brings to the table so basically
if it comes down to choices if you're a
tinkerer and you're willing to spend the
time you know hacking things a little
bit and you don't mind if if a card
isn't validated for 24/7 operation and
if it dies you kind of go to yourself oh
I spent half as much on this card as I
would have on the workstation one I'll
just buy another one and it'll probably
be higher performance by that time
anyway if you're one of those kinds of
folks GeForce can be a great option if
you're building workstations that just
need to work and you don't want to ever
touch them again then maybe there's a
value to you for the additional
stability that something like a Quadro
brings to the table I mean another
example is if you're building a system
for someone else where frankly it's not
your money anyway and you want them to
have a great experience with your system
maybe you just go for the hassle-free
solution that doesn't have the hack that
you implemented and validated by a
driver update that comes down through
GeForce experience you're kind of
sitting there going well dad wouldn't be
dealing with that if it was a Quadro
then you might find that to be a better
option as well now with that said you
can't just swap out Quadros for g-forces
and get all of the same functionality
some of it is just plain hardware so if
you're doing any kind of stereo 3d video
editing and you want to use a pro grade
3d solution that runs off of a DIN
connector Quadro is going to be the way
to go if you wanted to take advantage of
is deep color so 10 bit panels more on
this PA 279 Q in a moment for any kind
of serious color work during your video
editing process you are going to need a
Quadro because that's the only thing
that is going to support the 10 bit
output that that monitor can then
interpret and finally they come in form
factors that geforce cards
just don't come in this quadric a 4000
is a single slot card giving you a ton
of flexibility in systems where you
might also have you know a red rocket
accelerator and all those other things
where you can run out of expansion cards
pretty quickly and I mean for us it's
great because we were able to put a two
slot geforce card in sneak a single slot
quad row card in and still have a lot of
expansion for other things as well so
that's yet another advantage of quad
room for peripherals particularly for
keyboards and mice we've moved almost
completely towards gaming peripherals
not because gaming peripherals are you
know more professional-looking in fact
they're not
but because the functionality and the
build quality of them tends to be well
designed for more wear and tear than
your typical Mouser keyboard so this
right here my friends is the g6o 2 and
this gets my recommendation it lasts for
weeks and performance mode and much
longer than that in its endurance mode
it has very good precision and it has a
ton of fully programmable buttons which
can be great not just for gaming and
binding to your voice chat application
or whatever else but also for
programming in things like keyboard
shortcuts it's comfortable it's wireless
it's hard to go wrong for our keyboard
same thing we've started moving towards
gaming keyboards because features like
lighting up in the dark having
programmable keys on the sides having
built-in media controls in a volume
wheel well these are useful for
professionals as well as for gamers so
the g7 10 plus gets my vote it has
excellent software it comes with Cherry
MX brown key switches with oring x'
meaning that it's not that loud so
you're not going to be bugging your
neighbor again the loud system thing and
it's Logitech so it's extremely well
built and if anything goes wrong with it
you will definitely get a replacement
it's also very well priced for a
mechanical keyboard with those features
now when it comes to audio that's where
the gaming thing goes completely out the
window most of our guys here use IEM so
something like Sennheiser's ie8 would be
an excellent option although any kind of
closed monitoring or reference sounding
headphones from the likes of AKG Bayer
dynamic Sennheiser or Denon would be
great choices ASIS originally told us
they were going to send us a
new PB 27-inch monitor for this showcase
and I kind of went okay yeah I can dig
it PB is is a good value option if you
want you know great monitors that are
not factory pre-calibrated like the PA
series the pro art series is and if you
want me a little bit more value that's
not what they sent they ended up sending
a PA 279 q which is one that I can
wholeheartedly recommend for use with
this video editing rig or pretty much
any video editing rig yeah it's
expensive if you look at it from like a
gamers perspective you go pro art
monitors those are really expensive but
when you look at it from a professional
users perspective and you consider the
features you're getting you compare it
to something like an HP dream color and
it starts to look a lot more attractive
this right here is a 27-inch 2560 by
1440 monitor it has a 10 bit aah IPS
panel so for those of you who understand
what that means
great for those of you who don't that
means a much much tighter level of
granularity in the colors that it can
display so on your monitor when you see
blocking or bending between similar
colors that will not be present on this
monitor as long as you are using a
supported graphics card so in our case
of Quadra with a supported driver Quadro
and a supported application such as
adobe premiere now you are taking full
advantage of deep color it also has a 14
bit lookup table so it can actually
understand even more than it can
actually display to you giving it an
even better approximate those colors and
it's got more features as well so it's a
professional monitor meaning that the
on-screen display has an updated
navigation menu with a little four-way
switch it's highly ergonomic so you got
your height adjust yours tilt your
swivel your pivot all that stuff that
you could possibly want it comes
pre-calibrated like all PA monitors and
this time asus is going for gold because
they're promising a delta ii of less
than 2 and they actually ship a little
certificate inside the box that shows
you how your individual monitor tested
it supports six axis individual color
adjustment so that's on RGB cyan magenta
and yellow so you can adjust
the dual colors without affecting the
other ones it has uniformity
compensation which is one of the big
issues with even many pro-grade monitors
and that is to say that the backlight
isn't always uniform so as much as the
color reproduction might be perfect you
might still have issues with this corner
being a little bit different looking
than this corner and you want it to be
as uniform as possible comes with
compensation for that of course with you
know 10 bit panel and all of these fancy
features it has 99% Adobe RGB color
support and 100% sRGB color space
support and 120 percent NTSC color space
support and I think I've probably gushed
about it enough but guys this is a
fantastic choice if you're looking for a
great monitor for color work and you
don't necessarily want to spend several
thousand dollars on it choosing a case
for this was actually a bit of a
challenge because what's a professional
case I mean you don't want to go and
spend $300 on a case for a video editing
rig unless there's some kind of a
compelling reason like you need support
for 12 hard drives or something like
that you want something that's
reasonably portable if you ever had to
move it around or you know take it
somewhere else in order to work on it I
mean we do that from time to time when
we go to shows for example you don't
want it to be like you know covered in
like flames and plastic or all that
unless you don't mind people seeing that
when they come into your office for a
meeting or whatever else um so we ended
up with the silverstone TJ o4e it's
clean looking metal construction it has
great features it's around 150 dollars
which is reasonable although it's
certainly not inexpensive and it's easy
to build in I like this case I've been
using it for years actually back to the
old TJ o4 model I don't think
Silverstone gets enough attention for
how high-quality their products are and
how reasonably priced they are
especially we can when you consider how
much better built they are than some of
the other really really popular options
that are out there now if I didn't want
to spend 150 bucks and I didn't mind
stepping down to something that has a
little bit more of a plastic
construction the fractal design define
our four is a great option one of the
reasons we didn't go with the define r4
for this build guide is that we've
already done a build guide in the define
our four so I didn't really see much of
a value to doing another build guide in
the define our for the first step as
always is to prepare yourself that an
anti-static workstation not working on a
carpet preferably using an anti-static
strap whether it's on your wrist or like
I prefer to wear it on my ankle you're
also going to need a Phillips head
screwdriver which should be pretty much
all we need in terms of tools for this
particular build I always start with
building the system outside of the box
as much as possible and by box I of
course mean the case not the box but I'm
not going to kill the shot just for that
so I've got the motherboard the CPU the
CPU cooler on previous build guides when
we've used liquid cooling installing the
CPU cooler prior to putting the board
into the case has not been an option but
this time we're going to do that and if
you PS would hurry up and bring the RAM
to us I would have the RAM here as well
Intel uses simple eco-friendly packaging
for their 2011 processors it does not
come with a heatsink so it's a good
thing we have an aftermarket heatsink to
use they expect professional and
enthusiast users to have their own
cooling solution we open up the plastic
clamshell and find the little golden
triangle on the corner of the CPU that's
important so we're going to put it down
on our motherboard oriented correctly
relative to the little triangle on the
corner of the socket itself then with
LGA 2011 there are two retention arms
first we lift the one with the hook at
the end then we lift the one with the
kink in the middle and the straight end
once that's done we can lift up the hold
down plate position the CPU carefully in
the socket without putting any force on
it while we're putting it down if you
bend those pins you will likely be Sol
guys because no motherboard manufacturer
will warranty physical damage and
they're extremely difficult to repair
now we lower the hold down plate lower
the kinked arm and lower the hooked arm
then pull off the plastic plate and the
CPUs installed if you follow naktu as
instructions carefully mounting the Nhu
14's isn't going to be too complicated
you'll need all the hardware from inside
the intel mounting hardware box other
than the back
plate for LGA 2011 that's not needed and
then you'll need some stuff from the
accessories box so it does come with a
screwdriver which is pretty handy you'll
also need the extra fan clips the extra
fan grommets as well as the thermal
compound the only thing we're not going
to use from inside here is the case
badge which is totally optional and the
low-noise adapter because this
motherboard includes excellent software
fan control now that we've got
everything together it's pretty
straightforward
get the four little pieces with threads
on either side and the thicker thread
goes into the four holes around the LGA
2011 socket next up take the two
mounting bars and position them on
either side just like this you've got
four more nuts that then go over top I
recommend using a screw driver to
tighten these ones into place because
this is what's giving you the security
and firmness for that large heatsink
next up is applying thermal compound
I recommend the line method on LGA 2011
processors use a little bit more than
you'd use on a smaller LGA 1150
processor now you have to pull the
original fan which comes pre mounted to
your heatsink off because otherwise you
won't actually be able to mount it then
position it centered on top of the CPU
so that both of the pre-installed
tensioned screws are positioned over top
of the threads that are on that mounting
plate now alternating sides make sure
first that the threads catch then switch
back and forth until they stop and you
can't screw them in any further put the
original fan back on then for your
secondary fan which is totally optional
and is only if you buy an additional fan
what you're going to want to do is take
the thicker spacers that are included in
the box with your heatsink swap off the
four spacers that are on the side where
okay that are on the side bit is pulling
air into the fan so you can tell from
the label of the fan guys so here you go
the label should be facing away from the
CPU heatsink on that other side then
swap on the thicker spacers that are
included it's a little bit tricky you
got to kind of pull the little nubs
through the corners but this will
generate a little bit less turbulence
when the air is passing first from the
push fan through
the heatsink and then is being drawn
away by the pull position fan when
you're done it should look a little
something like this nice massive
heatsink
lots of cooling fans plenty of space for
64 gigs of ram now something you might
have noticed about this board is in
order to achieve its massive 7 PCI
Express slots there wasn't a lot of
clearance between the RAM slots and the
PCIe slots of a soos has done the only
natural thing which is to remove the
moveable clips from one side so you can
see here on the one side we have clips
that snap bore forwards and back and on
the other side we have no clips due to
the fact that there's no clearance there
so this makes installing Ram a little
bit different in this board from most
also if you were installing only four
modules please note that you would
install them in the blue slots because
we're installing eight modules we're
just going to go to town fill them up on
one side fill them up on the other side
now you might have noticed that on the
side where we put in the additional
spacer on the fan that is a very tight
fit for that first memory module so it's
up to you whether you want to opt for
the slightly less turbulence and
slightly lower noise operation or if you
want to opt for having a little bit more
clearance for your memory so the first
thing is to open up the case by removing
the two thumb screws then getting the
insides basically prepared so we're
going to remove that SSD mounting
bracket that's down here in the bottom
of the case we're also going to put our
power supply right in so if you look at
these these are the types of screws that
we use for power supply mounting for
screws there's a bit of a decision to be
made when you're deciding whether to
have your fan mounted up or down for
your power supply fan up has the benefit
of pulling air away from your graphics
cards and helping cool your graphics
cards but the drawback of drawing hot
air into your power supply making your
power supplies cooling less efficient so
we opted instead to go for drawing air
in through the bottom of the case this
case conveniently has an air filter down
here that you can easily remove and
clean whenever you need to this isolates
the heat from your graphics cards away
from your power supply and will make it
run cooler in the long term when
installing the i/o shield into the
KACE do a quick sanity check and make
sure you're putting it in right side up
just align the i/o shield with the back
of the motherboard make sure all the
ports stick through then align it with
the back of the case and press firmly on
all four corners this might require some
pressure in order to get it to work
properly and it's not in correctly until
it snaps into place and you can put some
pressure on it from behind without it
falling back inside the case now to
continue preparing the case we're going
to replace those stock fans and filler
all up with better fans for awesome
cooling so Silverstone includes okay
fans with their cases but that's exactly
what they are they're okay in the back
we're going to take that okay fan we're
going to take out all four screws and
replace it with an n F f12 now we don't
have to use the same stock screws to
install that in ff12 back there because
premium fans also come with some premium
mounting options so instead we're going
to use these little rubber Isolators to
have what is what is a very vibration
resistant mount so the way that it's
done is you position the fan then push
the little rubber spacers through as
much as you can you won't be able to
completely mount them this way then if
you have room for your fingers you can
pull them through to the point where the
fan now is locked into place and if you
don't have room for your fingers and you
can make your life a lot easier by using
a pair of needle nose pliers once you're
done with that check it out very little
vibration if any can be passed now from
the fan with its spinning blades to the
case on the top there's a top piece that
actually acts as both an aesthetic cover
for our fans and as an easily removable
and cleanable fan filter we have a bit
of a unique configuration for the top of
this case it accepts one 140 millimeter
fan and one 120 millimeter fan in the
top there is not enough room for us to
use those rubber spacers unless we were
really determined so in this case we
just went for the old hard mount with
screws it should be noted that again
premium fan features these fans have
little rubber Isolators built into them
as well so they're still not making
direct plastic to metal contact with the
case which
will reduce vibration we want to pay
special attention when installing all
case fans to the position of the cables
that are coming out of them with respect
to where we expect them to plug into the
motherboard or any other kind of power
solution that we have planned in this
case because we're one motherboard fan
header short on this board for the
number of fans we're going to have in
the system I'm going to be using a
splitter off of this top connector right
here into these two top fans so I want
them positioned near the back so I can
route them cleanly up there without any
additional wire clutter the last fans
that we're going to swap out are going
to require us to take off the other side
panel and there we go two more n FF
twelves these are going to be used to
directly cool our hard drive raid 10
array now I want to take a moment here
okay so yeah we use slightly different
hardware here it includes more of it but
just to save time because we're just
doing a build guide here this isn't a
permanent build I'm just doing two
screws per fan and at diagonals okay so
maintain the cable management that's
there and I want to take a moment to
talk about why I love n FF 12s and other
pressure optimized fans manufacturers
will often make the argument you should
use an airflow optimized fan for
something like a case intake or rear
exhaust or whatever else the negligible
performance improvement that you get
with an airflow optimized fan versus a
pressure optimized fan I feel is offset
by the versatility of pressure optimized
fans because you can do all the planning
in the world and if you go and buy an
airflow optimized fan that's going to
end up being a case intake that sits
next to hard drives pulls air through a
honeycomb mesh and pulls air through a
fine-mesh fan filter I would make the
argument that's more of a static
pressure optimized to application anyway
and you run into that a whole lot so I
love the versatility of pressure
optimized fans I find them more useful
in a wider variety of scenarios every
manufacturer takes a slightly different
approach to which motherboard standoffs
come pre-installed Silverstone has opted
for the skinny but full length ATX
configuration so that is six screws to
at the top two in the middle and two at
the bottom in order to put a standard
ATX motherboard or in this case a
slightly EA TX motherboard so
standard holes but it is a little bit
wider we're going to need three more
screws or standoffs rather so standoffs
look a little something like this and
they screw into the back of the
motherboard tray you're going to also
find another piece that has a Phillips
head on one side and then a socket on
the other side you can use that piece to
screw your standoffs into the
motherboard tray so we're going to
install three more one in line with the
two bottom ones one in line with the two
middle ones and one in line with the two
top ones so we end up with a total of
nine here here here here here here here
here and here now positioning the
motherboard it's important to be
extremely careful the last thing you
want to do is scratch the back yard on
those fancy new standoffs that you just
put into the motherboard tray so what I
recommend is going in at a bit of an
angle and positioning the rear i/o so
that it sticks through the back of your
i/o shield back here before you actually
lay the mother down more down flat on
the standoffs now holding the
motherboard in place put in at least one
screw in this case we're using the same
coarsely threaded screws that we used
for the power supply although this
varies from manufacturer to manufacturer
and even from case to case so always do
a test fit before you start installing
screws into your standoff so you might
cross thread something then proceed to
tighten in the other eight screws now
once you've done that is easier to
install your motherboard connectors
before we move on so we're going to
start with the front panel connectors
for the power reset and as well as our
LEDs so first up is power and reset for
these ones the orientation doesn't
matter so just follow the clearly
labeled connectors and clearly labeled
pins on the motherboard itself if you
have a little bit of trouble reading
those grab out the old magnifying glass
or better yet just consult the manual
because it'll tell you exactly where
they are next up are your power LED and
your hard drive activity LED for these
ones the orientation of the cables does
matter you want the colored wires
towards the back of the motherboard or
where the i/o and the PCI Express slots
are on all the suits motherboards that
way you're going to have your positive
and negative wires in the right
if you do get them wrong don't stress
out about it it's not going to break
anything just switch them around when
you realize that the light isn't working
next up we've got our front USB 3 for
this one be really careful to install it
in the correct orientation there is a
key on the USB connector itself as well
as on the socket so you shouldn't be
able to install it Corrine correctly but
if you did you would likely Bend all
those very fragile pins the USB 3
connector is very large but the pins
themselves are quite small and delicate
finally we have our front HD audio this
has been simplified so much since 10
years ago and now all you got to do is
figure out which block doesn't have a
pin in it align that with the one on the
motherboard that doesn't have a pin in
it and plug the whole thing in finally
fans we actually have an opportunity
here to show you a multitude of
different ways that you might install
fans our rear fan we have a little bit
of extra slack on that wire so we're
going to do my signature
not before we plug it into the
motherboard fan header next up we've got
our top fans I needed to use a splitter
for these because I don't have enough to
stand are enough headers on the
motherboard in order to install all of
my fans so the splitter plugs directly
into the motherboard this came with my
fans another benefit of buying premium
quality fans then runs around to the
back of the motherboard tray where
because I was thinking cable management
as I was building my motherboard fan
cables are already running so I can plug
those in tuck them away and I'm good to
go which leaves us finally with the
front fans
these ones are both different so one of
them is perfect it's a perfect run to
one of the remaining plugs on the
motherboard that's the top one the
second one the bottom one actually has a
cable that's too short now Noctua
includes very short cables built onto
their fans to allow for shorter cleaner
cable runs without having a lot of extra
wires to tuck away so what they also
include is extension cables so I'm going
to use one of those extensions in order
to make this wire long enough to reach
my final fan header which is down in the
bottom of the chassis next up we're
going to install our SSD and our hard
drive so in order to do any drives we're
going to
have to take out that entire hard drive
cage assembly so four screws two up at
the top and then two up at the bottom
this handle comes out and then you can
pull the whole assembly out of the case
now this is a very strange hard drive
mounting system I've never seen anything
quite like it before but it's also very
versatile so first things first things
first we're going to install our SSD in
the very very bottom here we got two
views screws that are countersunk screw
so that is to say they don't have a head
sticking up above them so we're going to
use anywhere from two to four of those
depending what you prefer it's an SSD so
it's you know not going to be moving or
anything so I usually use just two
screws on them so we're going to go
ahead and mount that down in the bottom
where it's nice and hidden then we're
going to have a look at this hard drive
cage it can accept up to eight drives if
you're willing to stack them right up
next to each other but the way we're
going to install them is we're going to
do 4 WD black drives and we're going to
stagger them out so we're going to leave
spaces in between them for more airflow
in between the drives however how
necessary this is I don't know so we're
going to install one screw into each of
them on this side then flip the whole
cage over and install two more screws on
the other side but wait we're not done
yet this is a very unique feature of
this case that's the kind of thing that
I would expect to see as like a weird
aftermarket option for most cases but
silverstone instead includes what's
probably a couple bucks worth of
aluminum in heatsinks for your hard
drives so you can actually mount these
directly to up to eight drives on the
other side they're going to be taking
air flow directly from those n FF
twelves that are coming in on the side
keeping your hard drives much cooler
than they'd be able to be if you didn't
have heat sinks on them if you wanted to
go crazy you could get some thermal pads
and install those in there or even some
thermal paste if you think you've got a
nice tight mount although you'd have to
check and make sure it's actually
mounted right up against there but this
is a very unique way to keep your hard
drives cool and very unexpected to see
as a stock option on a case so we can go
ahead and put a couple more screws into
each drive with the heat sinks there
then put the whole assembly together
it's quite heavy now and slide it back
into the case this is where silverstone
shows yet another great in
and that is with these SATA cable
splitters so you can see we're able to
wire things up quite cleanly now we
weren't quite able to reach that two and
a half inch SSD down in the bottom
however if this was my own rig I would
either stretch it and see if I could
just barely get there or what I do is
I'd move that SSD take the screws out of
it mount it with double sided tape to
get it a little bit closer and then I'd
be able to use those SATA splitters for
all of my drives and I'd only need two
SATA connectors to power all the drives
in my case very very nice thinking now
I've been using a new technique lately
where instead of pre attaching all of
the cables I want to my power supply in
this case we're using a modular power
supply and then running them to where
they need to go
I've been pre attaching all the cables
to where they need to go and then
running them backwards to the power
supply now if we didn't have a modular
power supply in this case actually I'm
really impressed I've never built in
this case before but check this out
behind the power supply there is a wack
ton of space where you could put all the
cables you need to that you're not using
from a non modular power supply
silverstone has then put the power
supply right up against the side panel
which doesn't matter because it's not
like it needs any extra space on this
side very unique approach I really like
this anyway we started with the 24 pin
plugging that into the motherboard and
then running it behind the motherboard
tray next up is the 8 pin for the CPU up
at the top left this is a no frills no
gimmicks professional grade board so
there's only one 8 pin because the
reality of it is guys you only need one
8 pin unless you're going like crazy
wicked liquid nitrogen which you're not
doing with a board like this now in
order to cable management those cables
we're going to want to install the rest
of the power supply cables so we'll need
to install our graphics cards first the
first stage in installing a graphics
card in this case is to remove this
little cover back here that gives you
access to all the screws that allow you
to remove the PCI slot covers which have
extra ventilation and very nice
silverstone so we're going to go ahead
take those 2 screws off and remove that
now it is time to consult the manual
because regardless of how experienced
you are technically and regardless of
how much you wish you could do things
without the manual this one's important
so the PCI Express slots on this board
they're all 16x physical ok but that
doesn't mean that you just take any card
and install it into any slot and you're
going to get optimal performance it
doesn't necessarily work that way you
want to check the manual where it will
give you recommendations for how many
cards you have installed and which ones
you should use so that you can best take
advantage of native PCI Express Lanes
versus ones that are relying on a PL X
chip for example so in this case we
wanted our cards installed in PCI
Express slot 1 and 5 so we're going to
go ahead and remove those slot covers
then we can install the Quadro into the
very top one we're going to be using
this for our display out the reason for
using the Quadro here was that with the
backplate on the GTX 780 it was too
tight of a fit with this cooler up here
even the Quadro was very very tight and
normally I would recommend using even
something like an on any kind of non
conductive very thin material in between
this heat sink and this graphics card
but in this case there's a chip on the
back that is non conductive that is
causing it to not short out but anyway I
would still recommend slipping something
in there to make sure it doesn't short
out because they're very very close to
these fan clips in particular right here
so we installed the quadrille then next
up is the GTX 780 so once that's done we
go ahead and put the screws back into
each of these cards so it's one screw
for the Quadro two screws for the 780
then we can go ahead and put that back
cover back in place and now we are
pretty much done with those so now we
can do the same thing we did last time
where we are installing our PCI Express
cables backwards so this power supply
the ax 860 I comes with harnesses that
have two plugs and ones that have an
individual plug so we're going to use an
individual plug one for the Quadro and
then we're going to use a dual plug one
for the gtx 780 so we only actually have
to run two cables finally we're going to
use a single four ports a two harness to
plug in our two and a half inch SSD and
then those two splitters that we were
using for power to our hard drives
remember guys we can now easily add
additional hard drives without running
any additional cables do to those
splitters we can fill this bad boy right
up now that we have everything run I
usually find its easiest to take
everything that isn't a power supply
cable and
all that down because they tend to be
relatively low profile so we'll spend a
little bit of time tucking things into
nooks and crannies and tying cables down
you don't necessarily have to have an
anchor point in order to get a cable
tied down satisfactorily you can just
take a zip tie even and you know tie it
to another cable that happens to be
running somewhere useful or tie it to
itself in such a way that you fold it so
that it's not visible anymore but either
way I find that it's you know worth the
time to just kind of play around with
those ones then get started on the power
supply cables so now that everything is
installed we can plug the power supply
cables in to the power supply
so first the 24 pin then the eight pin
and the two PCI Express ones those all
go into the same spots and finally the
one lone peripheral harness that we
ended up using this is one of the
benefits of a modular power supply not
having all those extra cables plugged in
and finally we can take those power
supply cables and now add them to our
cable management system at the back
making sure that we don't stack things
up on each other so much that we're not
going to be able to close the side panel
there is lots of cable management room
in this case but that doesn't mean that
we should you know take it for granted
necessarily either admittedly if I'd
been thinking straight I would have done
this earlier in the assembly process
probably before I installed graphics
cards but SATA data we have to install
our SATA cables that actually deliver
data to the drives so in this case this
motherboard has some interesting options
for how we can plug in the drives the
SSD for sure we needed a straight SATA
cable so unfortunately the board doesn't
come with any of those so we had to go
scrounge one but we plugged in a
straight SATA cable we're going to plug
that into the Intel controller say two
three six gigabit per second ports so
that's the very top state of three ports
alright next we've got four intel say
two to three gigabit per second ports or
four Marvelle say two three six gigabit
per second ports so we could plug these
drives these WD black drives into either
of them they both support the raid 10
that we're going for and it's just a
matter of whether we feel like we need
say two three six gigabit per second or
whether we want the compatibility
Intel raid because if our board ever did
die or for some reason we needed to grab
all these drives and migrate the data
off of them by putting them into another
system if you use Intel raid you'll get
better compatibility however we might
see slightly better performance
particularly in burst operations using
the Marvell controller so we opted for
the Marvell controller but you might opt
instead for the Intel one and that's
that's definitely a good option as well
in terms of cable management we weren't
able to move them back around the back
of the motherboard tray so we just ran
them up the drives cable tied them off
and then plug them into the port's where
they belonged well there you have it
guys we're done and the mystery of
whether or not we can put that six two
and a half inch drive cage back in when
we're done is has been answered the
answer is yes however I think you'd be
hard-pressed to cable managed six more
drives into that spot on top of being
able to have another eight drives here
and you would definitely need to add
some kind of SATA or SAS controller card
to even be able to plug in all of those
drives which I mean it's very cool the
amount of capability this case has when
you consider its size so without further
ado I'm going to hand it off to slick to
walk you guys through some of the
performance we were able to get out of
the machine as well as sort of his
impressions of the overall configuration
all right so we're going to jump into
the BIOS here and our mission is to
change to XMP profiles and to change the
boot drive so we're going to go to is
Advanced Mode and then jump into AI
overclocked tuner and change it to XMP
once that's done we're going to jump
over to the boot menu over here go down
14 times which is ridiculous down to
hard drive BBS priorities don't worry I
know it's not a hard drive just jump in
here change boot option one to your SSD
ours is an Intel 520 press f10 to save
you can review your changes and then
just press ENTER for yes and you're good
to go
so once we get into the controller we
just jump directly into the
configuration wizard and go down and
select all of our drives by pressing
spacebar and down once you've done that
press Enter change to raid 10 which is
just raid 1 and 0
keep 64k stripe size and it's a little
bit faster and then name is something
that probably isn't default and once
you've done that just go next and you
are done that's all it has to do just
press Y to confirm that you actually
want to do this and you'll see right
there under virtual disks that what
you've named is now an actual raid so we
wanted to talk about the PA 279 but
instead of just talking about it and how
ridiculously good it looks we wanted to
show it off so this is a 10 bit image
sample that we're showing on a 10 bit PA
279 panel and an 8 bit panel you can see
on the 10 bit panel that it is extremely
smooth and we mooney move it over to the
8 bit panel you can see vertical lines
running through it so while we can talk
about how good it looks this actually
shows how good it looks so we want to
show off the raw power of the system so
what running is DaVinci Resolve using a
source file that was filmed by Brandon
and then heavily edited by edited by
Etzel
we are currently rendering it using CUDA
although with this system you can use
CPU encoding cuda accelerated encoding
or even h.264 encoders because of all
the options that you have as you can see
we're using both of our GPUs the Quadro
is that fairly low usage and is actually
just being used for GUI for DaVinci
Resolve and the rest of the general
monitor and then GPU to the GTX 780 is
actually being used for its CUDA
performance so it's actually pushing
pretty hard along with the CPU you can
see temps in here right now both the
GPUs are sitting right around 50 degrees
which is totally fine and the CPU is
only going around 40 to 50 degrees tops
which is also totally fine and great for
this system as you can see the CPU is
actually running fairly hard bouncing
between 60 and 70 percent so with all of
that out of the way a big thanks to you
guys for sitting through this entire
video a huge thanks to Intel for making
this video possible these are extremely
time consuming for us to produce and
with their sponsorship we are able to
bring you guys these fantastic build
guides in the ultimate build guide
series and as always guys like the video
