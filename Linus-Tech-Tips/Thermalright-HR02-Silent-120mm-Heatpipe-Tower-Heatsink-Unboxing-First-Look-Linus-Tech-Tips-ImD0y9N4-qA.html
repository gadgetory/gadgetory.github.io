and it is made by thermal right they are
advertising this as a fanless cpu cooler
so they're saying that you can actually
run many of today's modern
high-performance cpus fanless completely
passive as long as you have some case
air flow with this particular heatsink
so let's take a look at it the first
thing we find is a thermal rate sticker
then we have an installation guide which
shows us a view of how to attach all of
the different mounting brackets it does
include mounting for 775 1366 1156 as
well as an to as I recall let me just
double check that when we get to the
actual hardware okay so here's the
included mounting hardware you can see
this is clearly for am too and then this
is clearly a multi installation kit for
Intel all right let's see what we got
for you look at this it comes with a
screwdriver check that out chrome
vanadium okay I don't actually know how
to pronounce that vanadium vanadium date
it's a screwdriver magnetic hey its
magnetic to look at that do we have
anything to test it on around here okay
here here yeah yeah here's a piece that
back plate it's not very magnetic okay
well that's okay you still get a free
screwdriver with your heat sink purchase
that is a compelling bundle offering
okay mounting hardware I'm going to need
my handy-dandy tech tips knife which I
now actually have that is officially
open now so in here you will find a
variety of things you've got some rubber
grommets we have some fan flips you have
some thermal compound cf3 next we have a
wrench you had a wrench and a
screwdriver you get like a toolkit with
this thing and then we have the am to
mounting hardware also a m3 and then we
have the multi back plate for Intel so
there yet 775 1156 and 1366 all right
let's look at the heat sink itself since
that's the most interesting part of this
video
other than me of course non fitting I
know the heatsinks the most interesting
part so this is the HR 02 and it has a
couple of unique design elements so we
got started here once I finally have it
out of the bag that thing is huge so
first of all it has a boatload of heat
pipe so you can see it's actually got
six full u-shaped heat pipes so that's
two almost 12 effective heat pipes when
you look at how they're all attached to
the base it's a very very shiny
flat-looking base and we'll do the
obligatory finger shot that everyone in
their dog seems to be determined to
complain about but I don't really care
all right so you can see first of all
that this heat sink has a very very wide
spacing for the fins that's because it
does rely on passive cooling so that
means when this is installed on your
socket okay so let's say hypothetically
it's installed like this it relies on
the heat that is generated by the heat
pipes transferring heat to the fins to
simply heat the air and then the air
will rise out of it or be pulled slowly
by a case fan and that's it that's the
only force you have so that's why the
fins need to be spaced really wide so
that it doesn't take a lot of pressure
to push the air through it now besides
the wide spacing of the fins you can see
what thermal rights done is they've
actually used their little I don't know
if they actually even have a name for
this but what they've done is they've
cut little holes and bent up the flaps
in every one of the aluminum layers here
and that gives us just a little bit more
surface area so based on that so you can
see that's all the way through the
heatsink I would probably recommend
mounting this heat sink this way either
this way or this way because that's
going to mean that I mean he rises so it
means that you're giving the air less
resistance to rise up through the heat
sink and cool your CPU now this hole
right here is probably why you need the
screwdriver that's how you're going to
screw it in if you're using an am2
socket so that's positioned right there
for that and then on the other side you
can reach it quite a bit more easily
that's one of the considerations when
you're building a heatsink this
is how do you actually access the
mounting hardware and so people can
actually attach it to their mother board
camera man's giving me his iphone for
the usual scale shot so you can see
compared to an iphone it would crash it
ah it's quite a bit bigger and heavier
okay so there it is from the side and
let's just have a closer look at how
they've attached feet the heat pipes
down here at the bottom so it's 60 pipes
alternating so some of them go over to
this side of the heat sink and the
others just go straight up in a straight
u-shape so all six of them are aligned
at the same level I've actually seen
some coolers where some of the heat
pipes are a little bit higher and I
don't know what that would do in terms
of thermal transfer but this way they're
all as close as possible to the CPU
without touching directly and I think
that pretty much covers everything I
wanted to say about the HR 0 2 i'm
actually kind of curious to try this one
out and see see how well it can do on
even like a core i7 or something like
that it's very heavy though</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
