video for the Western Digital at WD one
terabyte green ears advanced format
drive if you don't know what an ears
Advanced Format Drive is you should
check out my videos I've done a few on
this particular Drive outlining exactly
what advanced format is basically it's
better and it's going to enable better
storage densities in the future so let's
do the giveaway now I actually had some
questions last time around about how I
draw a random winner and the way that I
do it is like this I use Excel well I
would normally use Excel except I'm
stuck using the camera man's fail Mac
but I'm going to use numbers okay and I
start with my subscriber list so there's
no easy way to just take your whole
subscriber list put it in a hat and draw
one unless you have like ten subscribers
but I'm working with fourteen thousand
seven hundred and twenty six subscribers
so that's on my NCIX tech tips channel
basically I take that divided by 40
because that's how many subscribers are
displayed on each page so that means I
have three hundred and sixty nine pages
or partial pages of subscribers so I go
into numbers and I use the read between
formula I paste that in okay so I paste
that under page and I end up with 312 so
once I have that I take 312 times 40
which is going to give me which page I
want to start on so I'm just going to go
back over to YouTube here and we are
going to start on page no that's not
right hold on a minute hold on I can
figure this out on camera it won't take
that long
so 312 you have 312 times 40 equals oh
yeah okay so start at 12 480 equals okay
how could that possibly be right well
that can't be right
oh yeah I guess it's like right near the
end okay yeah there we go okay so we
have a page of subscribers next we are
going to go to our next sheet in the
failed numbers program and we are going
to pick a rend between row so we are
going to find that we are gonna row
number two so the winner is going to be
one of these ten people and then for our
final formula we are going to use read
between one and ten and we are going to
pick a column so let's go down to our
column spreadsheet here this is very in
elegant way of doing it so the winner is
page whatever page this is row two and
column 4 so slug bug is the winner as
long as he has subscribed to both of my
channels which he is so we just go in
here and verify he is subscribed to both
NCI XCOM and Linus tech tips he is the
winner we will get in touch with slug
bug 55 and thank you everyone for
participating and thank you for checking

isn't the only giveaway that I'm working

ntek true power Quattro 1200 oh I don't
want okay an Tek true power Quattro 1200
