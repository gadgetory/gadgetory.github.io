current state of RGB lighting in your
case or whatever you want to call it
we've had RGB lighting and headsets and
keyboards and mice and whatever for
quite a while now but inside of the case
it's been slightly more tricky one of
the very cool things that has happened
is a soos now has RGB 50/50 headers
which is the standard for RGB strips and
little cables that come off with them so
you can plug in RGB strips to them cool
cable laud also has LED strips now
ranging from RGB to UV to single color
ones so we're going to put the two
together and see how it works out
first we're gonna start off with cable
mods wide beam LED strips so these come
in RGB the main feature of today single
color whether that's like red green blue
white or single color but ultra violet
so yeah that's pretty cool the idea
behind wide beam is that it has a wider
spread of light than a conventional LED
up to 50% more which is actually really
solid if you want to have consistent
smooth lighting throughout your entire
case another thing that I really like is
the different ways that it can stick to
your case one of them is your standard
kind of adhesive style but it's with a
different adhesive than I think we've
seen before before on LED strips with it
is a a foam 3m solution which is
actually really aggressively sticky
which is great because it really sucks
when your LED strip in your case is like
bowing out and falling off and just
looks like junk and this one should
stick pretty well another one that will
strict pretty well and actually my
favorite one is the magnetic one ah I
love that that is super cool they put
little magnetic blocks throughout the
entire strip and it just sticks anywhere
in your case the LED strips are actually
in the case right now both of those are
magnetic another thing that I want to
mention is their power whether you're
just powering the IR LED box or if
you're powering an LED strip directly
you're able to do that using SATA
connectors which is actually pretty cool
because it would be a shame to plug in
in a molex trip to your modular power
supply just for some LED strips when you
could run a SATA connector that actually
allows you to plug in another one
afterwards which is pretty sweet it's a
pass-through SATA because you don't need
that much power for these little guys um
yeah
saves you cable management space uses a
more modern connector that's nice
molex can go away I don't need it
anymore now they are fully chainable
each end of the LED strips having a
female connector and then having these
male-male little bridging connectors
that come with your LEDs and if you want
you can have them IR LED controlled so
you can use this little box which comes
with the big package for the RGB LED
and here are your female connectors so
that you can bridge them into your LED
strips have these going in two different
directions if you want and then the
third little cable that comes off of
here is the led receiver thingy for the
box this allows you to use this
controller which is great it has on and
off so you can turn your strips on or
off if you want to go to bed don't want
the light on or something you can dim it
or make it brighter you can change what
color it's currently running or what cue
of that color it currently is you change
what mode it's in so flash strobe fade
or smooth all that stuff is great but
the usability of a controller to control
the LED strips inside of your computer
is a little bit wonky and feels a little
bit old and has been done for a while so
we're going to put all that kind of
stuff away I'm happy that it's able to
be done but if you have one of these new
spunky a Seuss boards that happens to
have the ORA connector or the Ora header
where you can plug in 50 50 LED strips
like these guys I think you're in luck
in terms of plugging them into the board
you can use a combination of wires but
you do need to use for the RGB
connectors the wire that comes from
cable mod that's a custom cable that
they have that makes sure that the RG
and B wires actually match up with the
configuration that Asus has for instance
if you don't use the included cable from
cable mod and try to set it on like
what's my CPU temperature it shows a
chart from green to red and shows up as
purple if your CPU isn't that hot which
is means nothing
also if you set it to music effect it
looks absolutely crazy if I set it to
music effect right now and listen to the
Christmas album from Linus Media Group's
awesome amazing Christmas band it still
kind of looks like it should probably be
playing dubstep
but whatever at least the colors are
somewhat accurate there's also a static
effect if I wanted everything to just
look white which i think looks great in
this case there's a breathing effect
just that I can have everything kind of
breathe in and out we all know the
breathing effect it looks really cool on
a Seuss logos have been doing it forever
in red strobing so basically this turns
on and off it's not super fast but it
just turns on and off color cycle which
will go through all the available colors
go and have this cool like gradual
rainbow effect and then yeah music
effect in CPU temperature like we
mentioned earlier also what you can do
with this software is sync everything up
if you want so you can have it so that
all of the LEDs in your whole rig so the
one that's on your motherboard and both
the headers that you might have
branching off are all synced doing the
exact same effect or you can decide to
individually control the logo header one
or header two thanks for watching this
video hopefully you guys enjoyed the
current state of RGB lighting personally
I think we've had some pretty good
improvements having headers on a
motherboard and having software on your
desktop just makes sense in my opinion
and the new mounting options of the
phone and magnets are huge improvements
in my opinion let me know what you guys
think in the comments down below don't
forget to check out the links in the
description there's an amazon affiliate
code that helps us out a ton especially
like super awesome
another thing that's super awesome is
becoming a contributor on the forum or
checking out one of our many great
t-shirts if you want to watch a very
cool video click up here I'm not gonna
tell you what it is though there's a
question mark and well there's hope
Philippe
is a Taryn please question mark and then
put the title as the block is just a
whole bunch of question marks and then
you guys should click on it and then
just see what it is and don't spoiler it
in the comments down below because that
is just rude I don't even know if it's
gonna be on our channel there's gonna be
an awesome video whatever it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
