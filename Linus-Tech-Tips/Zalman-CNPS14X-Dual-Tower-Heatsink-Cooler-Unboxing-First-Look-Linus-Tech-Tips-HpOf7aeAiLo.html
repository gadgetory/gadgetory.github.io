at the CN PS 14 X 140 millimeter fan
ultra quiet cooler from Zalman and
socket LGA 2011 ready and can use up to
three fans to additional fans available
for installation that doesn't even mean
anything okay
moving right along to the side powerful
cooling performance on a 40 millimeter
pwm fan with low noise u-shaped dual
heatsink excellent compatibility high
performance thermal grease is included
and it can be installed in mid tower
computer cases is what I'm sure they
meant to say it's like middle computer
cases like middle-earth
like if your computer cases like hobbits
and stuff powerful cooling performance
okay this this looks like most of the
same stuff we already saw so why don't
we go ahead and open this up this might
matter the weight is Wow
almost about two pounds actually that's
outstanding and long life bearing okay
long life bearing isn't an actual
bearing type I wonder if then you like
low ball bearing or like Hydra bearing
or kind of daring so on one of my
previous Zelman cooler unboxings I had
said that I liked their mounting
mechanism I think they've changed their
mounting mechanism since last time I
used it because it was a little bit
challenging to get all the pieces sort
of aligned and assembled and then and
then going in terms of packing materials
we're using a soft foam down here in the
bottom so there's not much risk of
damage and then this cardboard at the
top is going to be pretty much all you
need to protect this guy I like this
right here this piece it seems kind of
like unnecessary until you think about
it in terms of if you've ever had a
tower cooler with two towers before and
what happens when you accidentally like
bend them which is I've had this happen
so this is good
I'm a fan let's have a look at the
overall design of the cooler so the
obligatory finger shot is it shiny
yes it's shiny not like the the 9900 max
that we looked at before but it is shiny
and honestly it's not really necessary
for it to be a mirror-like finish in
order to make good contact with the CPU
in terms of heat pipes we've got sixty
types these are smaller heat pipes but
there's lots of them and the towers are
nice and big so you've got a fairly
dense
actually you've got a fairly dense
arrangement here so you're going to need
a fairly high-performance fan in order
to really generate the best performance
out of this cooler however I do like the
whole sandwich cooler design overall
because it's all it always felt stupid
to me back in the day that we weren't
making any use of the air that's coming
into the intake and we're only making
use of the air that the fan is
exhausting because some people think
that and they're wrong some people think
that the air that gets exhausted from a
cooler that's like let's let's say let's
say this part didn't exist it's just a
fan blowing down onto heat sinks they
think that the air coming out of here is
already like the maximum temperature
that could have been you know
transmitted to that air it doesn't work
that way I mean the air temperature
might only raise a few degrees going
from here with the through the fan and
through the other side so yes this side
is going to be slightly less efficient
than this side in terms of cooling but
it's a lot better than nothing so you're
definitely better off I mean a swift
tech did their stack series of radiators
where they have you could have two
radiators and the single air fans in
between as long as you've got a high
pressure high performance fan that is a
beastly way to achieve more cooling
surface area without sacrificing um
noise because you can use one fan to do
the work of two as long as it's high
static pressure so it's a 140 millimeter
fan you've got additional mounting
hardware included right here for an
additional two fan so this is actually
has very very dense because it's using
many thinner heat pipes and then a
fairly dense arrangement here but you've
got more of these that you can actually
mount like I don't know it'll go on
there somehow slicks trying to figure it
out too but I don't think he stands a
better chance I mean if I can't do it he
can't do it I'm just bugging you
it goes on here somehow yeah I really
don't think it goes there I don't think
that's it I think it's this one I think
it's this one I'd probably like
stretches over a fan somehow and it
might actually be this way
but everything would be hunky-dory
somehow it would it would fit don't
worry ah mounting hardware thermal
briefs is included and Zeldin case badge
and nice rigid backplate so that's one
thing it does have going for it and I
think that pretty much covers it so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at CMPs 14x from Zalman
and don't forget subscribe to Linus tech
tips from unboxings reviews and other
computer videos and just in case you
wanted something totally ridiculous
with your CMPs 14x you can actually set
up up to an additional 2 fans with the
included mounting brackets to go with
the one in the middle which means you've
got a push pull push pull configuration
on this thing making it like about as
big as a person's head see check this
out more performance more silence just
generally more of everything so yes
thank you for checking out this unboxing
and sort of ludicrous application of a
huge cooler from solvin actually this is
slightly different than the 9900 in
terms of mounting this was a little bit
disappointing to me so this is the same
so you'll you'll go ahead and you'll put
these in under these screws you just
loosen a little bit you throw this in
here and then you tighten them back up
and then you know it doesn't go there it
goes in between and then you go ahead
and you put these bolts through here and
then once this like if the motherboard
is installed in your case then this will
be really challenging because this will
be here or like here and then you'll
have like this reg and you'll be trying
to tighten it like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
