construction only five minutes late and
even though he's not here it was because
of Linus's computer yeah it's like 28%
Windows updates yeah
Lance's laptop has been sitting here
trying to Windows Update since before
4:30 and then now Nick actually has you
guys can't see it but he has two laptops
one of which just got factory reset so
he's going through the like Windows all
and the other one which has been stuck
doing a Windows Update for like probably
I'd estimate around like 11 minutes now
1011 minutes so yeah that's pretty cool
anyways welcome to the LAN show we have
a few topics that aren't waiting for
laptops to work
they are apples I Mac Pro is rumored to
be using server grade Intel processors
we have benchmarks for AMD's epoch
processor and pricing apparently so
that's pretty cool
also one plus five gets caught cheating
at benchmarking programs this is not new
what ok it's new for the one plus five
of this is not new for phone
manufacturers I'm not saying that's ok
for one plus I'm just saying you know
the NSA has opened a github account and
posted a bunch of programs there so
that's that's interesting pretty pretty
interesting
I don't think is a good way to put that
but yeah we will talk about that and
more after the brief intro whoo
like I would really just want to have
twitch ad open and I just know Vic
allows you know yeah you know a lot of
importance I'm not allowed to see this
yes
you know don't do the synergy show your
mouse and keyboard are multiple
computers comic bento use opcode LC you
get seven bucks off of comic bento today
and visit FreshBooks comm slash man if
you want to like do stuff that has to do
with fresh books which is like doing the
accounting of a small business and stuff
anyways
well you're still I have two computers
both have slightly different blue
screens on them now Hey okay he's
finally into his first computer and we
are into our first topic I'm going to
post the link in the note he is not into
his first computer nevermind and opposed
to the link in the chat oh also I think
we're supposed to set this thing to live
that would be a good idea come on buddy
we're gonna find a third computer I'll
be back okay bye Nick apparently YouTube
has their server had a temporary problem
and couldn't do what I asked it to view
and I've been told to try it again in a
few minutes so the announcement video is
not going to be up yet if you guys want
to remind me that focus the camera okay
Mac apparently I'm out of focus sorry
okay so we will we'll work on that
also my name is not Linus I'm sitting in
life this position today I will be Luke
today and the person sitting over here
will be Nick light once he returns I
mean I think it looks good to me but I'm
pretty bad at that stuff so your sound
is odd yes okay so that is because there
is currently construction going on like
30 40 50 feet give or take which person
we're talking about directly behind
where the camera is and this mic is not
super
narrow range so it can probably take all
that up
how's the focus now guys now it's in
focus okay cool good job max thank you
very much good job max thanks thanks max
- later Wow later all right cool
if I can get Google servers to start
working at least at least now like full
plane isn't the only one having issues
with uploads a has been a great show so
far does this have an title now okay so
if we want to kind of jump in I posted
link into the chat what we're talking
about right now is the rumor is the
rumor yeah there's a rumor that no it's
gonna it's it's posted on Oh mom don't
call me right now what this rumor means
is that the iMac Pro would be offering
server level Xeon processors their code
name isn't going to be sky like X or KB
Lake or whatever it's going to be
Pearlie which is interesting you can use
LGA 2066 socket yeah so no Rison no epic
for iMac pros I kind of sort of actually
saw this coming I think a lot of people
probably did Apple has been using Intel
processors for a very long time
one kind of neat thing is that the blog
also noted is that the iMac pro will
feature an ARM processor for like a
secure section of the computer secure
Enclave similar to that of the MacBook
Pro with the touch bar this secure
Enclave will add additional layer of
security to the Mac and it suggests that
there should be touch ID built into the
keyboard as well which is actually
pretty cool that's so they wasn't there
either like a rumor or something about a
Microsoft keyboard that also has touch
ID enabled so it would just be pretty
much saying oh I thought there was one
from last week
I don't remember that personally here
Wow I hate I hate edge so much there we
go
that video has been addictive which is
good YouTube it's having some behavior
issues Oh being there we go or did that
okay yeah so that's absolutely pretty
much all we have to say there just a
rumor about what might be on the next
iMac Pro I'm going to do a straw poll I
want to see what you guys think
what processors you guys think should
have been in there
let's go wow this is lagging a lot let's
go with epic or
2066 socket intel spoiler alert it's
gonna be epic that they want I just I
just want to see spoiler alert I just
want to see it don't insult AMD that
much when did i insult andy people are
so weird to me I don't know okay anyways
next topic because that one was sort of
boring epic benchmarks and pricing we're
going to go to the anon tech article
which I will share in the chat give me
one quick second this is the new 7000
series CPUs I'll jump back to that
strawpoll in a little while after we've
read through this article and bring this
up on screen so yeah fairly big news
it's pretty cool that they're actually
showing charts and stuff of it which is
nice it's going to be interesting seeing
the epic actually doing stuff this is a
whole bunch of different SKUs so these
are like probably all the epic 7000
series SKUs so that everywhere from
76012 the 7251 with the 70601 having 32
cores and 64 threads I know a lot of
people have already seen this but the
pricing information is here as well so
that's 32 cores 64 thread one is going
to be you know like around $4,000 just a
little a little bit rough quite a bit
yeah so mmm a little bit brutal but oh
well that one just to the bottom end of
that the epic 7251 is only going to be
around $400 though so you've got a
pretty massive spread in terms of price
but that does go again from 8 cores 16
threads to 32 or 64 threads so I'm not
too surprised I have found this whole
like giant war that's going on right now
between like I 9 and epic and all this
kind of stuff pretty interesting because
of the percentage of people that are
very viciously engaged in the war that
will actually even purchase any of it
yeah and like ok this is something that
kind of
I saw and I was like what are you even
saying but some people were like oh why
didn't you mention epic at all in your
core I nine video and it's like well
epic isn't a quarry nine competitor
thread Ripper is right yeah so like why
would we mention a server processor in a
core I 9 well they're both they're both
a little broad spectrum too and like
people will use them for both things so
I sort I sort of understand both sides
but yeah we also don't have it yeah yeah
which is slightly problematic but you're
right like it's you know like with most
things it's a lot of people who are
never going to buy either of them
debating not to say that that's bad
because we all know just like in the
auto industry stuff that you see on the
top top end stuff is going to trickle
down into the consumer grade products in
a number of years but yeah it's just
kind of okay interested I'm going to
shrink us a little bit here so here's
the disruptive woonsocket performance
stuff that's actually pretty cool I
always worry about getting benchmarks
directly from companies instead of being
able to look at a wide spectrum of like
different reviewers yeah because that's
my favorite way to do it if I get like a
whole bunch of different banks of
numbers because people can run different
settings on their tests people can run
different gaming benchmarks people can
run different whatever so you get on a
mass of everyone's different numbers and
look at the average and then you get
whatever you want but this is actually
pretty cool these are running against a
number of 2x so you have you have like
two processors from the intel side of
things which is pretty crazy
and it's still performing higher than
that so I don't know I'm very excited to
get me sweet like I'm excited to see
both Red River and epic in action so I
am personally stoked but that's about
all I can say right now because who
knows yeah yeah yeah yeah we need to get
it in office and like you never know
because what was there was something
around the the most recent actual launch
of an AMD processor I don't remember
exactly which benchmark it was but
there's a huge amount of controversy
over like how they ran it and how much
RAM was in each system and like how many
channels that were using to the
different Ram while I can assess so
when you get to the reviewer level
there's hopefully more transparency in
terms of like how their setups are being
ran what their different settings are
and you can get away broader spectrum it
was having a whole bunch of different
reviewers and a whole bunch of different
people that actually wouldn't bought it
all testing it which is super cool yeah
definitely let me check that straw poll
now I actually think I might have lost a
link with my work I'm very sure after
you have it okay so you want to post
that in twitch channel yeah sure Oh
actually uh I'm not logged in that's
fine I will grab it from you I got it
cool okay great so people wanted an epic
processor by 65% versus 35% this is this
is interesting I know like we and
probably the majority of you guys are
not the target audience for an iMac Pro
so did they probably don't care also
this is going into like deep
partnerships that have probably been
worked on for a long time
who knows if Apple even knew the epic
was coming I have no idea but like it's
interesting to see how the market is
shifting because I bet you if you asked
this well I guess there wouldn't have
been competition but it's just fun to
see this war happening I guess it's kind
of what I have to say because seeing a
poll like this hopefully some people
from different brands and from different
companies see this and go oh interesting
maybe I should put maybe not epic
necessarily but AMD processors at some
tier depending on whatever product I'm
making yeah into my device because
people are wanting it it's nice that
it's actually a conversation again yes
where there's actually the question oh
it's cool we use until R and E yeah now
that we have my like biggest worry
leading up to this whole thing was like
oh my goodness that sounds like a huge
amount of work now we have all the
writers and they can do the work I'm
actually very excited this is an
interesting time I what I really want to
see is more polls like this I want to
host more polls like this online show
and I want more people to talk about it
on the forums and stuff not that it
isn't being talked about a lot but
because yeah the more the word goes that
the mortal
be putting stuff and that's exciting
most definitely kind of move on to the
next topic it's probably enough about
that for now one plus five gets caught
cheating at benchmarking programs so
this has happened in the past I believe
with Samsung and probably a few other
people as well it's fair to say probably
most if not all phone manufacturer yeah
at this point the oneplus 5 received
about a five percent boost in
performance achieving the highest
Geekbench for scores of a snapdragon 835
to date instead of dropping to 0.3 one
gigahertz when there was a zero percent
load the 1 + 3 T score cores would stay
above 0.98 gigahertz for the little
cores and 1.29 gigahertz for the big
core Wow yeah oh geez
ah go away okay there we go that's not
something yeah that's a little rough oh
well like I don't know I have been just
like when was when was the last time
that you took like hardcore benchmarking
numbers into consideration with the
phone that's another there we go I'm
going to do another straw poll actually
I'm interested because right now for me
yeah usability battery life yeah because
like everything that I want to do on my
phone even game stuff any like fairly
high - your phone will be completely
fine with all of the games that I wanted
to play yeah personally I literally
never look at phone like benchmarks but
I am not the target consumer for that
style of information so is this is this
in benchmarks that they were running
themselves pre-launch and then releasing
or is this like a totally market wide
thing like is the release phone doing
this or is this just their benchmarks
I'm not sure if you can check into the
post there you don't have access to that
okay I'm just going to finish up this
poll real quick let me see if I can get
some stuff going in here okay we create
the poll and drop it in the chat
there you go check out that straw poll
in the chat I'm interested to see what
you guys say
battery life is usability is probably my
number one most required needs to be
really good feature on a phone then
battery life for sure and then it starts
getting to performance and stuff of
course but I'm not entirely looking at
benchmarks I just need to make sure that
it can do what I need to do very fluidly
that's kind of what I'm looking for and
mm Geekbench itself I have not been
super interested in for quite a while I
think but I'm going to check the straw
poll pretty much immediately and see how
this goes
so sorta is is the top result and that's
kind of exactly what I expected very
important is literally the lowest result
with only 59 votes at 7% not very is the
second-highest not at all is the third
highest and important is the fourth
highest so very important and important
together only get like 25% of the vote
and that's with a very tech centric on
tech centric audience yeah so like it I
find it interesting that companies would
cheat because I feel like you're getting
bad PR for cheating but you're not
getting a huge amount of good PR for the
5% of bonus that they got I think it's
one of those things that's like a huge
disconnect because yes you're 100%
correct but I don't think that they have
this information or maybe realize how
you doin it
so stop cheating you're freaking kind of
cheating it just makes you look bad so
squirming and then like it's a it's
apparently I guess 25% of a tech
audience is actually fairly significant
yeah so maybe I get that to a certain
degree but you gotta remember that okay
new straw poll twenty five twenty five
percent of the audience that's going to
be the person who their entire friend
group goes to or family group goes to
and is like yeah hey what phone should I
get yeah that person now saying hey
these guys are shady essentially so yeah
I just don't don't cheat whether it's in
phone benchmarks or anything else in
life just just be a good person things
will happen as they're supposed to
happen
essentially so I'm making a new straw
poll I'm asking does cheating and phone
benchmarks make you dislike a product or
a company just in case any phone
companies sell that last poll that we
did and we're like 25% of viewers think
it's pretty important maybe we should
start cheating I'm going to see here
because they get caught like every time
I think does cheating in phone been
trying to make you dislike a product or
a company yes or no we're going to keep
it pretty simple this time and I want to
see what people who the straw poll heavy
show but you know what I mean
I'm down we're gonna review this to do
straw me without doing straw polls we
should that would be a do you like or
not entering the straw polls straw poll
yes versus no there we go good so some
people don't really care and to be fair
I'm maybe a little bit in that group
it'll turn me off on a liking and
company a little bit not that much but
like 70% of people dislike it if you
cheat on benchmarks their phone
companies I think I would care more if
it was cheating with the outlier it just
makes me like distress benchmarks for
phones in general no yeah like yeah it
just makes you go like okay even more so
I don't care about those benchmarks but
I honestly think that's part of the
reason why the previous truffle that we
did was so heavily in favor of not
really care about 400 years we've all
just been like well they fit all anyway
frickin bogus anyways yeah Tom Chambers
and twitch chat asks is Nick on drugs
today and the answer that is maybe if
being high on life count there you go
best best best joke best joke I could
ever take yeah buddy okay moving on the
NSA opens a github account this is
actually kind of hilarious I'm going to
post this in the twitch chat as well
this is from SB times by the way I'm
going to go through and call out the
people who actually posted these topics
so this one was posted by who vertical
box on the forum thank you very much
previous one was nerd Slayer one that
was the 1+5 topic epic benchmarks was
posted by tech fanboy and the Apple iMac
groomers was posted by red round two
so the nsa's github account this is
actually kind of interesting yeah here
we go so it lists all the different
programs that they actually wha
stop it papa bad all the all the
different programs and stuff that they
have on there so apache accumulo a ki
slash value store that features
server-side programming cell based
access control ability to scale and
stable client API that follows semantic
versioning one of the interesting things
in here and some of them are actually
kind of cool but I wonder if people are
going to actually use them because of
all the bad press that the NSA has had
for a while now especially with like
what was the name of that uh ransomware
that like was just around wanna cry
wanna cry having such heavy ties to like
leaked NSA stuff and having like
backdoors all over the place and all
this kind of not very good things
another giving out software it makes me
kind of wonder if people are going to be
a little bit worried about actually
using it
Java Pathfinder manager jpf mango a
static code analysis tool designed as
part of the NASA Ames Java Pathfinder
project it's like this is kind of my
take on this in general and this came
from DGM 1802 and twist shet who said
NSA github government transparency and
my response is they want you to think
that yeah there's going to be like an
obscenely huge one stuff they don't put
on here and it's probably like super
outdated crap that they're putting on
there just speaking as a total layman
who hasn't looked into it at all my
initial assumption is if they're putting
it on github they don't use it anymore
and they haven't used it for like two
years
yeah cuz like defense software
trickling down into the public is a
thing that happens just not immediately
so like Nick said this might be slightly
older things you can forgive internet
and GPS as to services that came from
those kind of locations they did release
30 to open-source projects which is
pretty cool and people can pour through
the source which is a good thing one of
them is DCP a program that reduces the
time span needed for making friends at
copies of hard drives for forensic
analysis which is cool and freaky at the
exact same time maple syrup close to my
heart assesses the security state of an
arm-based device by examining the system
register interface of the processor
security enhanced Linux or se Linux
security enhancements for Android or se
Android and more like I said there's 32
different things that they released so
that is both cool and interesting and
transparent and not transparent and
everything else that is confusion and
limbo II when it comes to NSA things
eventually I don't know yeah if you're
done with that topic apparently there
was a flash crash for aetherium
yesterday yes yeah is it back up so as
cerium went down to like ten cents
yesterday I don't know what the Syrian
price is now
listen it looks like it pops back a
little bit but maybe not entirely if we
can get Jake down here he would totally
know so what it looks like the twitch
chat will also know it's a topic that we
have and I don't you think so but
somebody was spamming it into a chef so
I decided to look it up
essentially what it looks like happened
is somebody tried to sell a giant boat
load of aetherium like multi million
dollars worth of aetherium is back at
326 so apparently it just went like yeah
Rhaego you know a typical lesson in
supply and demand rate if you flood the
market with something the value is going
to drop significantly and with a market
like this where it's so young and and
there isn't like a set standard where
somebody can look at it and go okay
there's a large supply right now but we
know that it's going to have longer-term
value like people are going to be
trading it immediately when they see
like oh crap the market has dropped and
more people try to sell do that and yet
yada so just kind of interesting and and
one of the concerns I guess that that
you always have to have in mind with new
currencies and crypto currencies and all
that is like one person can
significantly impact the price of the
entire market
yeah to be fair that's happened with
real money too though oh yeah someone
okay not someone a few people in chat
are posting repeatedly in all capitals
GTA 5 mod saying are you going to talk
about it or no I'm pretty sure we talked
about it last week if you want the best
details on it those are going to be from
other sources yeah like the mod thing
this summation of the mod thing is
essentially they were being dicks they
now sort of went back a little bit on
what they said and they said they're not
going to impact single-player stuff but
I don't think that's what people cared
about anyway well at the same time so I
read that to add to the gta5 thing I
read that in a statement saying that
they're not going to attack the
single-player stuff yeah but in their
actionable items it didn't have anything
to do with that so it's still super
sketchy okay because I know the
is single-player mod stuff came out this
week I'm not sure if the actual items
was from last week or okay okay but yeah
I think people don't really care because
most of the mods that people actually
care about are the multiplayer ones
anyway so like yeah like GTA RP I think
I think it was a super stupid move for
them to do hopefully they hopefully they
figure there's life oh yeah I don't know
but yeah I'm pretty sure we talked about
it last week
I know it's still developing but yeah
I'm pretty sure we did talk about it
last week if you want to know more
there's lots of like actually really
good fully detailed reports I'm sure the
GTA 5 sub reddit is all over that
there's there's tons of details on this
online we don't have like properly
detailed notes in our dock for the show
today so I don't want to dive into it
too deeply and say something wrong
because that would be bad
so I would I would the statement was
mostly empty empty legalese yeah exactly
so I didn't actually like really mean
anything when they're talking about the
single-player thing which was kind of
sketched nobody gives us blank about
multiplayer mods I think they do
yeah original totally do it yeah modded
servers I think we're like a huge thing
right they they killed single-player
mods that's what people were pissed
about I'm sure a huge percentage of
people are pissed about single-player
mods I'm also sure that there's a
percentage of people that are pissed
about multiplayer mods I think a lot of
people are just angry in general because
they probably should have been left
alone because I haven't heard anyone
screaming or upset about the mods
existing in the past and I've heard a
huge amount of people screaming upset
about the mods existing now so ok yeah
they will we'll see how that keeps
developing speaking of developing
Netflix interactive TV
choose-your-own-adventure
yeah I saw that I don't know man I think
it's kind of neat I don't really know
what to think about it outside of that
and
no burrito yeah I know I watched I think
the the person that has the key site to
this shirt philip defranco we talked
about it in a video I think it was him
that I was watching said that he thinks
that super cool because he used to like
choose your own adventure books right
and now he can like relive that with his
son by doing choose your own adventure
Netflix stuff I don't know how well it's
going to work apparently the first one
is called puss in book as in like the
Puss in Boots
yeah trapped in an epic tale it's
debuting today but I don't really know
when this was posted so there we go ah
three days ago
so it's up now if you want to go do what
use your own adventure on Netflix you
can do that that's a thing with puss and
book it's a it's an interesting
direction for them to go into I just
like I don't know it's one of those
things where I think the experience is
probably so much better with a book and
it's another like dumbing down of
entertainment step that we seem to be
taking in the past years but it's it's
cool and you know the perfect example is
like you said with Philip DeFranco where
he wants ya go through with his son like
I think that's an excellent use case I
just think that it's an extremely
limited genre but then again I would
also say that YouTube Toei content and
kids content is probably an extremely
limited genre and it's literally the
most beautiful thing on the platform so
maybe I'm just stupid I'm not afraid to
admit that a little bit of an
interesting tidbit here most TV
experiences and the latest iOS devices
should it should work on though not its
own site an Apple TV isn't compatible
either nor are Android smartphone or
tablets but support for these platforms
could come down the road I guess
wait what yeah so their own website
Android devices and app
TV it doesn't work on so what does it
work on IO iOS devices and most TV
experiences okay but not Android TV and
not Apple - so like Smart TV is the
biggest thing I'm sure like Tizen and
all that stuff so that's good but you're
still kind of got a gigantic percentage
of consumers you don't ban that yeah
I'll work on that if you want to keep
talking about yeah I mean I don't think
there's a ton else to say it's an
interesting direction it's you know I
think it's what always at chromecast
I think chromecast would work if you
were streaming off an iOS device I think
does chromecast mirror on your device or
does it just broadcast I think it
mirrors on your device so as long as the
device that you're using Orca supports
it right I think I think your device
would be the important thing there yeah
yeah as long as the interface is still
on your device and your device supports
that I'm sure it would be fine yeah I
think it'll be okay so we'll see that's
interesting
I can't even watch it because I don't
have a smart TV or an iOS device I just
use the browser or Android TV so I'm
boned yeah
so I won't get to go on a posted book
choose-your-own-adventure
on Netflix I'm sure you're devastated
I'm my life is being that's point but if
you guys would like to report back and
tweet me or the live text handle and let
us know wait oh that's his personal one
now so I guess tweet me or lioness who
isn't here and let us know what you
think of Netflix Interactive TV that
would be cool because I don't think he
can watch it either know he has an
iPhone yeah because I kind of want him
to try it because he has his kids or
whatever yeah so if I don't use case
that makes sense
I think the LG TV he has is not Android
so it could probably work okay yeah so
all right this
yeah I guess we should do the sponsor
stuff now but there's a lot of rapid
fire Wow yeah cool there's kind of a
rapid fire and a weak synergy I'm gonna
talk about synergy so I have a video on
synergy you want to check that out
I don't remember what the title is but
if you look up fly effective synergy
you'll probably find it more magic than
Apple wishes their Mouse was this magic
or something that that yeah kind of
weird but if you look up synergy it's
like a pendant on the end of the title I
believe so you can check that out sooner
G is a software download tool that
solves the problem of having like a few
different computers in one area hooked
up to a few different monitors with a
few different sets of keyboards and mice
you can keep the same amount of
computers and the same amount of
monitors but just one set of keyboard
and mice and have your keyboard and
mouse automatically transfer between all
the screens no matter what the OS is you
can go Linux to Windows to Apple to
whatever the heck you want and it
supports drag and dropping of files and
all this other kind of stuff which is
super cool they have different tiers of
options they have a basic option and a
pro option it's a one-time payment for
lifetime access which is pretty dope
actually pretty damn cool yeah they've
clipboard sharing even drag and drop
like I already said you can set up
hotkeys to transfer your stuff over you
can also have it so like the method that
I like is that when you get to the
barrier between two systems so if I have
like a a Windows PC with two monitors
and then a Linux PC with two monitors
the monitors that are on the say Windows
PC the barrier between those it's fine
it just passes right through it normally
like it always would but the second you
get to the Linux PC it will give a
little bit of a stutter so it'll pause
right at the end and if I keep pulling
my mouse then it'll jump through I like
that just so that it doesn't jump all
over the place too easily but yeah you
can set all that up yourself or you can
just hotkey yourself over so you can get
there and then jump with your keyboard
if you want to be more efficient that's
also cool as well
you can get it for 50% off which is
actually a pretty intense discount at
Simas coms endless
less simply less seamless sign seamless
sure it's sym so there we go but
seamless makes the most sense calm slash
synergy slash Linus 18 which is also
right below me right here so they're 50%
off of a product that you have for your
whole life is pretty cool kind of dank
now we're going to move to comic bento
comic bento is your original comic book
subscription box there's at least fifty
dollars of value in each box in terms of
comic books each box comes with four or
five graphic novels it's 25 bucks a
month or less depending on the plan that
you select
there's monthly themes like gnarly 90s
and out of retirement this one is girl
power I believe so this one is to do to
the girl power yeah you get a nice
little kind of info card that tells you
gives you like kind of a synopsis of all
of the books that come in it and yeah
shows you Evan cool yeah they have a
bunch of different books in here one of
them is Marvel they say it's one of
Marvel's most exciting new teams
so there's damsels in XS which is this
one here and did you do because the
world still needs heroes champions
change the world is the Marvel one like
there's like a Hulk like person and some
x-men like people in there and did you
do the vampire Huntress she looks just
kind of like that at us yeah Wonderland
clash of queens that's a you know so
deck cards and I can I can euro this one
just looks like someone looks like she
like messes people up yeah like like
that's a pretty insane like ax thing
that she's got going on legit yeah right
and that's right over here oh it's
really hard to point really bad but
right about there it's hard to see on
that camera but she has like a crazy
like psyche looking accident
pretty cool it's this this this week's
months is for soft covers and one hard
cover which is actually pretty cool if
you use offer code LPT you can save $7
off of your purchase over at comic bento
com one second that just need bless you
in advance come on it's not happening
this is so frustrating also the last one
it didn't happen so we're good it's
fresh books fresh books there's a super
simple easy to use accounting software
cloud accounting software actually which
is pretty cool it helps you track your
time with the timesheet function you can
manage your expenses by just taking
pictures of your receipts and bringing
it into the system which is pretty cool
I can take care of this guy alright and
I jump back here it does a ton of stuff
we used it for scrap yard Wars to be
able to keep track of how much money we
had left as we were buying parts along
the way which was actually very helpful
even outside of a sponsor standpoint it
was yes very helpful if you have any
questions feel free to reach out to
their support staff where you'll speak
to a real human no phone tree no
escalations no return calls you to call
them you get a person that's it just two
answers which is pretty fantastic all
their functionality of their desktop app
is also in their mobile app as well they
understand that businesspeople are often
on the go these days which is cool that
makes sense
visit fresh ebooks.com slash lan and
enter when and how did you hear about a
section when you sign up for a free
trial which is very cool also fresh
books is our title sponsor for LTX 2017
our Meetup and tech con flash carnival
if you haven't gotten your ticket yet
head over to the LPP official section or
get your ticket through the link below
which will be on the description for
YouTube not the twitch guys sorry about
that but yes if you also want to get to
do so anyone second
yeah sorry nope that was the LTX ticket
thing that was trying to do but yeah
first works.com slash tech tips enter
the land show in the how did you hear
about a section and there you go free
trial yeah it's good the mobile thing is
actually really cool because you don't
want to like lug around a bunch of extra
crap that you don't need necessarily
what make this your whole business is
just in here yeah so you're just like
actually pretty neat because now almost
everything else is just in here as well
so fresh fix fix fresh bx fresh banana
fish being fresh books build a few
school wait what
there's a rumor that a Seuss colorful
and MSI are releasing GPUs for mining
this was posted on video cards I'm not
that surprised with the sheer amount of
like lack of GPU stock that's going on
lately
no AMD cards are anywhere because
they're just sold out all over the place
which is great for them that's perfecto
right now and it's starting to dip into
the Nvidia stuff as well but I think
they've got just more stock of various
things
yeah like wasn't this sort of already a
thing is it just Asus is it just there's
more people doing it or is it like it
well there was like weird like minor
appliances and stuff that you could get
but these are specific GPUs but they're
targeting for it okay so they're saying
it's an Nvidia P 106 - 100 with six gigs
of DDR gddr5 GPU boost clock of 1708
megahertz memory clock of 8192 bit
memory interface fairly standard in
terms of that like a 10 to 16 I don't
see any actual pictures it says it's
based on the GTX 1060 yeah an expedition
series but I don't see any actual
pictures about them
kind of interesting apparently they're
gonna be more efficient than normal
geforce cards in cryptocurrency by about
thirty to maybe ten percent depending on
the skew so that's fairly major
especially if they're priced to the same
yeah so if this is priced the same as a
ten sixty yeah I don't know I'm curious
if like this is going to be a consumer
thing or if you have to like buy like is
this are you going to be able to go to
Newegg and buy a P 106 100 or as well
because I think that's the graphics
engine so they'll call it something else
okay but yeah so apparently they're also
making versions on P 104 100 which we
based on like GT X 1080 1070 design so
it probably sell more of those yeah but
I'm just curious if this is something
that like say you're just a perm or
consumer phobia you're just a presenting
wants to have a mining rig in their
garage can you just go buy one from
Newegg or do you need to contact Asus
and go through like a bunch of rigmarole
to get one it kind of looks like you'd
be able to just go buy it from nuoc
because they look like gamers they look
like enemy and user cards yeah sure they
don't look like just rack cards that
have the most basic shroud on it they
can put these are stylized but I thought
the whole point of these is that they
didn't have display outputs so is that
apart from the missing DVI connector
okay yeah so they like we saw a look
like this
contact I doubt it'll be that game ring
personal yeah but you never know I was
expecting more along the lines of this
yes that's my assumption was something
closer to a founders edition look yeah
but maybe not it's interesting this
could be a smart move if the theorem
keeps up for a little while this could
be a smart move especially because
they're not rebuilding the wheel there's
got me tooling a few cars and releasing
them oh yeah like I think it's a really
smart move from the manufacturers
perspective it just depends on what
availability looks like how the pricing
shakes out and like is there going to be
resale value in these
yeah like because right now if you all
know that they were used for getting
yeah though they were used for mining
and there if there are no display
outputs then you can't sell them to
somebody who just wants a gaming card so
that's good for the for the use market
in that sense because then you won't be
going to Craigslist and buying it and rx
580 and being like oh did somebody mind
with this I don't know probably like I'm
not going to be able to game on it for a
long time I don't know but yeah if
you're if you're buying one and let's
say you just buy one or two and put them
in your put them in your garage just
because you like to mind and it doesn't
end up working out or etherium crashes
or whatever it might be
can you resolve are you going to get any
money for them yeah I don't know that's
going to be interesting because like
it's not going to be as searched for for
gamers
yeah because gamers gonna be looking for
specific names for other different cards
well and it's and people know that it
was used for mining well and the cards
don't have display out yeah so you can't
use it for gaming well I wonder if you
could use it as like no except you
slightly different card I looking to
play an SLI browse literally edges like
it's going to be a slightly different
card so no weird interesting article
apparently this was supposed to two
hours ago so we didn't have it in the
dock but a bunch of people just spammed
this and I read the URL and it looked
interesting apparently we're going to
jump here now I posted it in the chat as
well if you guys want to see that and
other people I'm sure are going to keep
on posting it because it's just posted a
lot hackers reportedly leaked 32
terabytes of secret Windows 10 code well
Microsoft has declined to comment but to
be completely honest this was posted two
hours ago yeah so they probably did
getting their PR people together yeah
they haven't like it's gonna be a long
night yeah exactly someone is not
sleeping at Microsoft for probably an
entire team of people they're not
sleeping at Microsoft right now so yeah
expect a better statement later on I
don't think this is more of a decline to
comment it's like guys hold on let us
figure this out so the files include
much of the code that Windows 10 uses to
work with PC hardware including built-in
USB Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers actors
in
they're bad actors are now for you sift
through the data and look for potential
vulnerabilities leaked to beta archive
comm a site that seeks to preserve and
make public software that would
otherwise never see the light of day and
it appears to be taken from Microsoft
starting in March Wow
some people are saying fake news this is
a very recent post so take this with a
grain of salt
it's only been up for two hours
Microsoft has declined to comment I'm
not necessarily saying this is
absolutely true
someone just linked the data archive
article right now so apparently the
folder itself was 1.2 gigabytes in size
contains 12 releases each being a
hundred megabytes this is directly from
an admin from beta archive I'm going to
bring this up right now so he's saying
that it is very far from the claimed 32
terabytes
so yes and say can you say like them the
registers article said and so did the
Business Insider one that we just read
he said it cannot possibly cover these
core source code which I would agree
because it's way too small to do he's
saying that first of all let us be clear
about a few facts the shared source kit
folder did exist on the FTP until this
article came to light we removed it from
our FTP so it's gone off of beta archive
right now and listings digits do we
currently have no plans to restore it
until a full review of its contents is
carried out and deemed acceptable under
our rules that's cool I don't know a ton
about beta archive but that's cool they
seem to be doing the right thing there
at this time all we can deduct is that
the register refers to the large Windows
10 release we had on March 24th which to
do if any of this could should change we
will remove these bills from the FTP and
we will happily comply with any
instructions so by Microsoft so they're
like hold on don't play louder they'll
play box we didn't do it we go away yeah
I don't know so take all of that with a
grain of salt not only was the leak not
even remotely anywhere near as
big as it was claimed but people are
still sifting through the data who knows
what's actually even going to be there
it's an interesting thing that there was
a leak of Windows 10 code at all it
could be all completely meaningless
garbage and nothing might come from this
Microsoft might go I'm going to punch
all you guys in the face and everything
will get really bad who knows I have no
idea some of the chat was like Windows
11 a leaked there we go yes that's
exactly totally what it was thank you
but yeah I would maybe see it happens
every time I'm most Davis our way
through the show and then it's just
going to be completely borked for me for
a sec so you're on your own for a moment
but yeah I I would take that entire
article softly especially when something
just gets leaked maybe wait I think it's
good someone posted the was the name at
site beta beta archive data archive link
right away with an administrator from
that site talking about it directly
that's super cool I'm happy that they
reacted really quickly pulled the stuff
that they had are reviewing it or
actually taking the time to look at
things properly I agree with all of them
so I just found another link around me
to go back way back to near the
beginning of the show the etherium crash
and it's pretty much what I expected so
they said that it dropped about $296 too
low of $0.10 in a matter of minutes
almost as quickly as the collapse the
price bounced back at 6:25 a.m. on
Thursday Assyria was trading at $340 per
unit lorna how many people got purchases
in at $0.10 I don't know but so one of
the main issues is that the way a lot of
people have their stuff set up is that
it has auto sell when the price reaches
a certain amount so the multi-million
dollar or sell order was the initial
drop and then as soon as that dropped a
bunch of people's triggers happen and
they were like oh crap sell now sell now
sell now so like just not only that
initial multi-million dollar
order but a ton of other orders flooded
the market so it triggered 800 stop
losses they said and yeah that's that's
essentially what can happen in in an
unproven market for any market really
but yeah that's that's kind of
interesting to see that something like
that can happen so quickly because like
if you look at the time graph here I
don't have sharing unfortunately but
it's literally just like a few moments
and then it was back yeah
like the overall time graph of a few
hours that looks like yeah so this is
just from the span of to 2 p.m. to 4
p.m. it's a thin line on this graph as
it draws down and then goes back up
which I pretty cool mix going to pull
out like the cheddar I want to see if
they logged in anything he can't so no
he's totally not going to do that but
what side is that on that was on
business insider so if you look up
Business Insider last crash explained
yeah you will find the chart that we're
talking about it bounces back up super
crazy fast yeah I doubt anyone even
really bothered to stop mining because
it was so fast
they always literally a matter of like a
moment it hit a huge amount of news
places but yeah ends up being not really
that big of a deal
so that's probably a good thing I guess
it's it's driven a lot of interest in
the computers area it's driven a lot of
interest into how to do all this kind of
stuff and it's driven a lot of purchases
of graphics cards which is going to help
AMD which is fantastic because like
especially AMD cards are just gone which
is great that's cool someone in chat
says this was on one exchange stop
talking about it like it's global ok
I'll stop talking about it like it's
global it was on one exchange sorry bro
it's still that's kind of a beginning
still interesting insignificant yeah
give us one second okay
the other interesting topic Asus
releases XG dash C 100 C a 10 gig NIC
for under $100 its $99 so it's
essentially $100 but it is it is
technically under $100 which is pretty
sweet
I got him already by later bitch and
that's that's great this is another
thing where like the the more that this
price goes down means the more that
people will buy it means the more the
price will be able to go down so it's
really good that they have this NIC out
there it'll be great once these are
built into boards I don't know why that
random keyboard video is right there if
you could not be there that would be
good that's fine
this is this is really exciting I'm sure
Linus is probably going to jump on these
he loves his networking stuff this is a
10 gig NIC for like almost nothing
one of the difficult things with a lot
of these is going to be giving
everything in your network that you need
to have this actually having one or
everything your network that needs to
have this actually being compatible with
one as in like you can even plug this
into it
so yeah but on a hundred bucks 10 gig
NIC that makes it so that like I could
definitely see many consumers being like
I want just a crazy fast bridge this is
like 200 bucks between these two
computers that's not the end of the
world I'll just go ahead and do that yep
that's not too bad excuse me sorry
give me a quick second sorry I don't
like the fact that people are buying
Knicks neither do i I don't want to be
sold it is it is kind of surprising that
people are still buying Knicks in 2017
and I don't even mean like the human
trafficking side of things writing like
actually network interface cards because
I thought like a few years ago okay
we're like done that now on the consumer
side of things not that not that okay to
be very clear not the enterprise side of
things I'm not surprised at all that
that's still a thing like multi-port
like for port and more next sure that
totally but like when you build out and
spec out a computer including a nick in
it was like dead for quite a while dead
meme yeah and then now like I could
totally see people doing that I wouldn't
think it was that weird to see someone
be like here's my configuration for my
computer and includes a 10 gig Nick if
they have the hardware everywhere else
and their network to support it
pretty fancy dancy um Nancy dancey I
want to show floatplane but as this is
the only one that can see the other
stuff I can't really can you work on
getting logged into that and then plug
another thing I can't like to this I
can't you can't do it here no can we
talk about it your phone we what use
your phone to help you plug in to this
or do this no because it would take too
much time
okay I also don't have access to the one
that you think I have access to okay oh
right that makes sense alright nevermind
speaking your virtual currency razor
makes a push with a twenty million
dollar investment which is pretty crazy
razor has invested close to twenty
million dollars in Malaysia based online
payment firm M o l global as part of a
push to establish its virtual currency
for gamers in Asia this is there like
XIV all Z vault digital wallet and Z
gold rewards program that you guys have
maybe heard of it's it's kind of
interesting razors Network combined with
that of Mo L will allow users to buy its
points at over a million won
at over a million online and retail
stores across Southeast Asia New Zealand
and Australia
what are these even being used for right
now because last time I looked at it it
was like not a lot I don't know why they
would spend that much I think this has
to be something that's like like really
big in Southeast Asia and that we just
have no interest in in North America for
some reason like I'm curious if maybe
there is yeah I mean look crossfire
that's not a super popular North
American that's like the Korean
counter-strike yeah isn't it so like I I
have a feeling that we just have no
perception of how important this is
because we don't experience it here I'm
not sure if it's perhaps due to like a
lack of availability of credit cards to
some people or something like that
but it seems like currency cards and
stuff like that are a lot more a lot
more widely used in Southeast Asian
these countries that they're targeting
with this investment compared to over
here in this day like can MechWarrior
Online warthunder crossfire CES I don't
know if this is our cager Archmage our
gauge yeah arcades yeah yeah I guess I
think it's interesting that they bought
a company that big to run this yeah but
they just must be pumping huge sorry who
did they buy mo L online oh yeah almost
twenty million dollars that's kind of
yeah doesn't burn Zee silver pay with Z
gold so they just trying to go up
against like Nexon or whatever I guess
that's interesting isn't next I'm like
one of the bigger ones
so these silver this I think this is
what I knew of because you can get like
the the razor Mirage holder and the
mouse and stuff like that Z gold was the
one that I wasn't fully aware of because
these silver like you just need huge
ridiculous amount of it but then you can
get some like razor Hardware stuff just
cool I guess yeah but the gold is
something entirely different
yeah so it's just like another digital
currency I guess sure there's people on
the twitch chat who use this and know
on it is Eagle raise your smog holder
yeah RGB mug holder it's absolutely
pretty neat I'm just going to put that
out there it is pretty cool
Edie has one I'll take one twitch Oh mo
l points yeah I love to a chef
interesting I sold someone is someone in
chat Linux source code leak
LOL jk is it that I sold razor for $450
and bought Zee vault for $500 I don't
even know what that means what but I
love it cool good job yeah heck yeah
moving on this is titled valve gives
oculus the finger with five finger
controller a little bit of a sensational
title that we have from the internal
title people but this is mine he's
wondering if you want more oh no I'm
good thank you
so this this we've seen this before I've
even talked about it on the LAN show
before but I guess this is like an
official Hey look from from valve which
is cool they have a middle finger
CapSense ring finger cap sense and pinky
finger cap sense which is cool that's a
lot of different sensing locations
interface button outer face button these
are these on the outside if you could
see my mouse pointer here can i zoom its
going to auto we're going to get rid of
this so there we go
so the outer face buttons are like this
one here and this one here you have the
track cut in the middle still system
button right there still not too
surprising and then a lot of the sensory
stuff will go around like this part of
your hand which is kind of cool it looks
much more similar to the oculus
controller then I would probably say the
vibe controller but it kind of looks
like an extended okay yeah the parts
before the ring yeah they get rid of the
ring that part still kind of sits in
your hand yeah and then it the the ring
part is sort of being a ring on the end
kind of wraps around the back your hand
that which is kind of interesting but
that's that sensory stuff for all of
your fingers because there's trigger
then there's the three fingers that
you're using to hold the controller
which all have independent individual
CapSense there's the trigger like I
already mentioned and then the trackpad
the outer face button and the system
buttons so it can tell where all your
fingers are all the time which is
reciprocal actually really good for very
very immersive oh yes extremely Amarista
touching immersion much Wow much wow
much well that's a dead meme
speaking of ER Google VR YouTube's new
VR format I don't know this is almost
certainly not going to be heavily
targeted at desktop tethered VR
experiences like rift and five I think
they're more expecting people with like
the a dream daydream cardboard if that's
really a popular thing still your gear
that kind of stuff even yeah they're
demo video of it is like here's a phone
using the slo-mo guy is a with a phone
and daydream this was 180 it's not 360
that's interesting but it sort of makes
sense yeah you're sitting out on the
couch or whatever yeah creators can
shoot the videos using any camera with a
VR 180 certification real day dream team
is working with three companies it's I
mean it's kind of neat
filmmakers will no longer have to hide
behind trees I don't think this is an
extremely freeing thing for filmmakers I
don't think this is going to be very
widely used he would be extremely
narrowing your audience and then the
whole video would have to have been shot
this way so it's going to be a lower
quality experience for everyone else
yeah that isn't viewing in VR it's a
cool thing it's cool feature to have on
the platform for sure but I don't know
it's one of those things that is really
one of the huge limiting factors of VR
in general right and that in order for
someone to create like a truly immersive
and amazing experience they have to in
some ways like fall on the sword and
just be like I am executing my creative
vision for this game to be VR and I know
it's not going to sell that many units
and it would sell a lot more if I
designed it not for VR yeah like someone
someone it's been brought up in the chat
a few times now like buy one of these
certified cameras and do a build log
with it or do a build guide with it or
do something like that
and I hear yeah I personally think that
would be really interesting but the
amount of people that could actually
watch that would end up hurting that
video so much that I don't think it
would do well that could be an
interesting test thing for us to do
though yeah if we did a 180 degree VR
build guys have it'd be like the only VR
computer build guide that there is and
like if we got like a chest mounted
camera or something like that you could
see around the table all the time or if
it just like hovered above the table so
you can kind of look around I'm not sure
about positioning of the camera for a
build guide that's another thing like
once you have to start breaking it down
I don't know how much of a benefit there
is for a build guide to be in VR because
it would still be a fixed point camera
so it's not like you could lean your
head into the computer it's not like you
could lean your head to the other side
of the computer it's one fixed point
camera
yeah it's 180 not 360 channels super fun
that's a little bit more applicable but
then it's a lot of work for channels to
go out in development for a channel that
doesn't be very well yeah just beyond
yeah like like the second you try to get
Luke will you make a VR porn review no
but apparently that's like with a huge
amount of the content on the oculus
subreddit now I keep on going like on my
reddit account looking around scrolling
through I follow like different tech
reddit and all this kind of stuff I keep
on seeing not-safe-for-work posts and
I'm like what the heck even is this I
don't see any up there right now I don't
see any up there right now but it's
fairly common base news Luke I'm telling
you a man fake it's early comment
erroneous and I get it it did make sense
that it would be good for that it's just
I don't know that's not my thing
Tesla creating its own music streaming
service but there's a rumor for that I
just like why I don't know why they
would do that how could okay here's my
thing how could it possibly be more
cost-effective to go out and build this
thing and build relationships with all
these different record labels and pay
licensing fees to all these different
record labels and tape people to pay
licensing fees to all these different
record labels and pay people for support
when this stuff goes wrong and P
developers and P these people and those
people how could it be more cost
effective to do all of that than to just
go to Spotify and be like yo Dawg we
want to get like a thing so just like
we'll pay some money we'll use Spotify
and then it's good which they already
offered Spotify like directly through
there so I I did read one compelling
thing where a lot of record labels are
concerned with Spotify getting a
monopoly on the market so they are
willing to offer competitors to Spotify
better deals and stuff like that in
order to like maintain the like
competitive nature of the market and all
that stuff but like from a pure dollar
standpoint I don't understand the move
by Tesla but then again Tesla is
one of many companies of Elon Musk that
has a history of not making any money at
anything that they do for a number of
years and then everyone just going holy
crap this is super dope and becoming
super successful anyway so maybe I'm
just again I'm probably just stupid and
don't understand it would make sense to
me
if what they were offering was and I
know this is part of their plan they
plan on having a multi-tiered service
where they have like radio like things I
think they said like Pandora and also
Spotify like things on their own service
if they just had a radio like service
that they offered as a default through
the car right away and then you can like
yeah pick a platform after that I could
see that making some amount of sense
because radio like would be much easier
for them to spin up someone says it's
about the Tesla AI tech I mean maybe
this is just a very shallow look at what
they're trying to do maybe they're
trying to create you know a system that
recognizes where you're driving on the
road and what the road conditions are
like unless you even alluded so or that
and you're yes your speed in the vehicle
and your personal preferences and take
all these fact maybe they take it like
heart rate through the steering wheel so
again maybe a dart light you patan
drinking the heck out maybe start
playing more calming music maybe hey
dude chill hey that's that it's going to
be okay don't crash the car as usual
there are a lot of people smarter than
me in the world that probably have all
this stuff figured out already so that
could be pretty interesting it could be
a lot more interesting than I'm giving
it credit for like it notices that all
of a sudden like one or two times a week
there's a person of a certain weight
profile that sits next to you and you
drive a little bit slower and you tend
to go to like a restaurant and like one
other activity and it's like okay almost
like we're playing more romantic music
I'll make this work I'm gonna help you
out its it sees your car becomes your
wingman you leave a restaurant at like
11:00 p.m. it starts playing like Barry
White you end up going to a residential
address before going home so it plays
like a different music to try to like
chew you up a
and no man will be ok this actually
sounds pretty cool now that we're now
that we're talking about a little bit
yeah now that I am NOT being
closed-minded about it it sounds kind of
interesting yeah we'll see what they
actually do with it I I no wonder the
Barry White anymore
says you hey if you know the car would
probably know the age of the person
driving it and find like romantic
applicable music to that age group as
well so everything will be fine but I
don't want bumblebee as my wingman well
unless you drive a yellow Camaro you
won't have bubble B yeah yeah I think I
think with that we might be kind of done
I think I think that's the show ah
there's the power-hungry rx Vega is the
title of this one MSI's RX why did it
auto scroll to the bottom of the page
MSI saying damn rx Vega needs a lot of
power you know what that's probably fine
because power supplies of large capacity
I haven't really been needed for a while
now so we're just giving them a reason
course there's like please please let us
sell more ax 1200 I clean hand B convey
go please take a lot of hot don't help
so much apparently the frontier boards
which again like these are not the most
consumer facing boards ever but as the
power consumption I don't think anyone
expect it to be lower than frontiers
which has a board power of 300 Watts
air-cooled or 375 liquid cooled edition
so yeah these things yah they can they
can take the power so it's really not
again there's not a lot to say here not
a super news heavy week but we'll see
once we get them we do power testing of
like all the stuff that comes through
here in terms of cards so you guys will
know how much power it takes constant
shows up in different load scenarios
which will be good but yeah I don't know
most computer internal components have
been taking less and less and less and
less and less power for a really long
time so it's probably fine I know a lot
of people out there that only have like
a 500 watt power supply and barely I
don't think it really matters if you
take up two hundred extra watts because
most people who have bought pcs in the
last year's have probably bought pcs
that are way too big yeah yes they're
for their needs
it will probably be found we talked a
bit about full plane without showing it
before the end edition we can do you
know what videos are on there right now
I can maybe jump on real quick and look
without showing you guys so there is we
checked out the cheapest motherboard we
could find on on Amazon oh I'm already
logged into the right account eh let's
go there we go so this is flow plane we
can see on tech wiki why can't you use
your phones on planes let's check this
out right now look at Linus he wants to
use this thing but he's like I can't I I
don't know whoa that's new a good job
Dennis I don't think we've green screens
like an actual actually that might have
been while Dennis was in Taiwan so good
job whoever I was gone it's gone now I
kind of liked it just fine
is that a paintball gun why would you
that's weird
anyways moving on ltte up old people are
the worst technology then versus now
this is actually people like this so far
it's hilarious
I'm in it as both an aunt and a grandpa
yeah which will be explained once you
watch the video it's uncool plane you
can check it out right now
Luke is Linus's dad yeah officially but
how do kids Linus's dad confirmed I am
green I am lionesses daddy daddy daddy
it's a weird word it is the cheapest
motherboard on the market we played
games on it which is cool that was that
was an interesting video I checked that
out there's a say hello to the folk
playing Club Flo playing vlog number one
which I actually I guess you know what
I'll show this real quick
and jump into here this is a sneak peek
at what is going to be the front page of
the website once we actually launch the
website so in the actual text in here I
talked about all what the different
sections look like and what we're
planning for those sections and how
everything's going to work in yada yada
yada
and there will be more blog posts like
that in the future I have already
started writing next weeks which will be
like a more succinct like what the heck
actually is float playing club so I
think it'll be good to have something
that I honestly link people to instead
of trying to reiterate what it is every
single time we have a tech quickie
encore I nine fast as possible that
might already be on YouTube actually
potentially know it's coming YouTube on
money cool yeah cool
there's a bunch of stuff full place cool
if you want to see what is going to be
on YouTube next week this week you can
get on clopin code playa someone says
please tell me you aren't making a
scroll website but weird roll with
things so they're saying like a one page
no super not no don't worry your pretty
little head about it that entire thing
that you just saw okay I'm going to I
mean I don't like the like intro to that
is the whole that is the whole front
page that's it I wouldn't necessarily
call it the front page because that's
not what like okay yeah so I guess
that's a good call so this whole thing
that you can do right is action page
which like this is the top part of it
and then this is the bottom part of it
and that's that that's it that's the
whole page is just the introduction page
this is the front page that you see if
you are not logged in to the website
once you're logged in to the website you
will see whatever creators you follow
and their most recent posts or videos or
whatever this is just shown if you don't
know what the heck the website is it's
split into two parts which is like the
login kind of area at the top which is
the biggest part because we expect if
you dump here that you're probably just
looking to log in because if you're
going to the website and you don't
already have an account you're probably
going to the website from a creators
link because
slow plane is about the creators not
really jannat about discovery yeah so we
don't really expect people to land here
unless they're trying to log in so the
main big areas are like right here which
is the learn more which would just jump
you down or start watching which is like
the big one because it's like hey this
is supposed to be easy and bright to
click on because this is what we want
people actually doing a creator search
area and then just information at the
bottom that's it not a not a one pager
so to comment on a couple things in chat
Nicki V office takeover yes that is also
yep
there right now it's actually pretty
pretty funny and the endings will get in
the fields yeah
like the real fields well yeah the
fields hold Fury from somebody asks
where's Linus's d-wave video so with
many things like the do a video when
we're going behind the scenes and
checking out like the you know sensitive
information of a company in many ways we
have to get approval on all that stuff
so it has already been edited it's been
sent off to the brand they checked it
out they gave us some feedback we're
implementing that feedback and then
it'll hopefully become in a floatplane
next week
one more thing are you waiting yeah the
quantum computer company yeah yeah the
quantum computer company somebody asks
are we getting new payment options you
can stay tuned on that you're working on
working on that a lot Nick ended up to
me it sucks
yeah that industry sucks yes so very
much to working on it it's not there yet
but we're working on it and it'll be
there by the time that we get the the
real the real side up and everything
yeah I think that's that's that's that's
not just probably it checkout floatplane
it's been a fun time over there how can
we pay for a floatplane currently just
pay power right now PayPal once the site
is live we plan on having more ways I
know a lot of people in chat have been
saying accept Bitcoin can you take
Bitcoin but above above but we'll
probably look into that we'll see we'll
see there are some options that the main
first hurdle that we're trying to get
over is not just being PayPal
so we're trying to figure out well Nik
again is mainly trying to figure out how
to use how to be able to accept other
things should I like talk about some of
the boring businessí things about it
like me why it's hard sure so one of the
main issues is that there are like
there's payment gateways which are the
things that accept the outright of cards
and debit cards all that stuff and then
there are subscription management tools
as well and sometimes payment gateways
have subscription management tools
integrated into them but friends we
don't sometimes they don't but if you do
that then you're essentially locking
yourself in to using that payment
gateway forever unless you want all of
your users to have to re-enter all of
their information when you move to a new
one so it's like a massive thing that
we're trying to figure out because it
literally could affect floatplane for
the life of it whatever that ends up
being hopefully the number of years so
that's that's why payment stuff is
taking so long because it's a huge thing
and it's something that I am NOT
personally super familiar with and I'm
learning a lot about as we go so making
sure yeah it's it's it's messy it's been
a learning experience for all I hate
PayPal you stripe we're looking into
stripe we're looking into looking into
Braintree we're looking at strive for
looking into a bunch of different ones
lots of lots of lots of different stuff
Luke Luke said I am NOT sad it's just
really hot in here right now it's like
yeah I'm like a little and and is the
the payment gateway thing maybe makes me
a little sad it's been a it's been a
quite a process where is deadmau5 at
once again when there are that's why
people been saying deadmau5 okay when
there are large celebrities at play as I
would say dead most is very much it was
a lot of hands on with vide there are
hands on the video their hands on rights
releases and image releases and etc etc
that we're working through so that video
is coming soon
TM but yeah it'll be there soon and I've
seen it a couple times now and it is
really freaking cool that dude has like
the coolest life have to say like super
badass and he's Canadian yeah
but here's here's a sneak peak his
garage is a Tim Hortons storefront he
like bought the whole thing didn't he
like what just for fun
like what can he get Tim Hortons there
no he should have hired a storefront he
should hire like a barista person he
could do it I mean he he definitely
could he should franchise his importance
on his property oh my god and like still
have his property so other people can't
come on it but he should franchise to
Morton's there so but just he can have
Tim Hortons somebody says Tim Hortons
question mark exclamation mark I'll be
pretty do you really not know what Tim
Hortons is are you just stoked ones can
we pay with germanium what is that
isn't it like an element who's who's Tim
Horton shame shame every Canadian shames
you shame anyways I think we're done
with the show for now lay it out here
we're coming by everyone for attending
this episode of the wine show check out
floatplane chickaletta's tech tips hit
the bell on youtube to subscribe to see
all the notifications for all the videos
we ever put up and thank you have a good
week have a good day tomorrow have a
good we get right up on intro right
what do you do for a living I'm deadmau5
