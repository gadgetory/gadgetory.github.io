exciting product now this has sort of a
more value oriented price point compared
to something like a ZX series which is
80 plus gold and fully modular and like
lots of good stuff it's really good
power supply but they're expensive so
this is the ZT series which has sort of
ninety percent of what the CX series has
but at a lower price point so it is a
fully modular power supply with a five
year warranty 80 plus bronze is still
pretty darn good on a yearly scale we're
talking probably about six to seven
dollars of difference assuming you're
running your computer like full load
like many hours per day you can go back
and check out on my NCIX comm channel
the episode I did about 80 plus gold
where I compared the cost of running a
non 80 plus power supply with an 80 plus
gold power supply and I gave sort of a
couple different scenarios and yeah the
cost is not that big of a factor as long
as it's a nice high quality unit then
you are going to be getting the
performance you need of your PSU so
inside the box we find a manual which is
actually surprisingly thick look at that
ok so it talks a little bit about 80
plus efficiency level certification so
80 plus bronze is eighty-two percent at
twenty percent eighty-five percent at
fifty percent eighty-two percent at a
hundred percent okay and that's at 115
volt which is what we use in North
America so you 80 plus gold is about
five percent more efficient across the
board but as I said before it's really
not the end of the world however you
know what this chart really outlines one
of the reasons I tell people not to over
by on the power supply because if you
buy a 1500 watt power supply and you're
using 300 watts at idle which you're not
because most computers use about 100 to
150 watts at idle you're getting less
than anything on this chart in terms of
the efficiency that your power supply is
rated for you're not even in the sweet
spot which is about fifty percent so
connector specifications here we can
look at the specifications I suppose max
output on the 12 volt rail is hold on
not so good
okay hold on a second you know what
let's just look at the side of the power
supply because that is the less
complicated chart here's a bunch of
different languages which I do not care
about but somebody does and that's why
they're there all right next we have the
power supply itself and I haven't
forgotten about the cables we will go
back and look at the cables later I just
wanted to see once we get the little
baggie opened up here hey it's got a 1
40 millimeter cooling fan oh it doesn't
oh yeah they're just okay so on the 12
volt rail we can do up to 744 wats so
you can do almost the entire output of
this 750 watt continuous rated power
supply on the 12 on the 12 volt rail
which means that no matter what you
throw at it in terms of graphics cards
or where you plug them in because this
is a single 12 volt rail power supply
you will get the full output that it is
rated for so I'm being a little bit a DD
today but I'm going to go ahead i'm
going to put the power supply itself
back down i'm going to go back to the
box because i just want to see if in
this unboxing i missed anything ok so
they've got ratings for the cable
lengths which is good to know there's
not Turtles looking for continuous
output radio at a demanding 45 degrees
Celsius ambient temperature wow so their
rating this power supply add a
completely unrealistic temperature and
not unrealistic in a bad way unrealistic
in a good way if this delivers the
performance they say it does at that
temperature I guarantee you it's
performing better than they say at in a
room temperature which is going to be
less like what about 20 23 degrees
Celsius sort of in that range single 12
volt rail we already talked about that
premium low ESR 105 degrees Celsius
electrolytic capacitors compliant with a
tix v 2.2 okay large temperature and
load control this is cool so the fan on
here most fans are temperature
controlled on power supplies this one is
load controlled so what that means is
your friend is actually going to start
spinning faster as soon as your computer
is drawing more juice from the power
supply why is that important because it
means that your power supply will never
heat up any higher than it has to
because it's already predicting that
there is more load
the components and they're going to heat
up it is cooling them before they even
need to be cooled very neat all right
next we have 80 plus bronze which we
talked about already and then to sort of
safety stuff over voltage or over
current over power and short-circuit to
protect your components five-year power
swap warranty remember when the power
swap warranty first launched that was
with the ocz before the mod extreme this
was power stream yes with the power
stream power supply so that means that
you do not have endless repair return
for repaired loops they just send you a
new one no big deal that is pretty much
it I'm done with the box okay now we're
going to go back to the cables so we've
got a big gold fat computer cable here
so what is this ah trying to find out
how thick it is why don't I just tell
you guys it's thick and it's UL
certified so probably safe next we have
some pcie cables eps ah yeah that's eps
okay got other more different eps kind
of the more different pcie i'm just
going to sort these into what they are
and then we'll come back to the middle
okay so first thing we find is our
24-pin connector so these are clearly
labeled psu and then like not psu ATX so
that goes into your motherboard cable
lengths I wouldn't have any concerns
with the premium power supply like this
but I'm go ahead and check it anyway
there you got a nice long 24-pin
connector so even if it's a button sorry
about that guys we ran out of memory so
this will be a adequate length free
whether you have your bottom mounted
power supply whether you want to go
around the back of the motherboard tray
come out the front whatever the case may
be nice long 24 pin cable never hurts
when you are building a machine alright
what else we got so uh pcie cables here
let's have a look at the lengths of
these pcie cables tend to not need to be
very long because whether you have a
bottom mounted power supply or whether
you have a top-mounted power supply the
distance is kind of the same so I don't
worry too much about that but there you
go that is the length in terms of Linus
Heights it's about a xiphoid process to
a top of the head sort of length all
right next we have
r 8 pin ups connectors of which there
are two these look like they might be a
little bit short but let me have a look
actually that's not bad okay that's
pretty good so that's actually longer
than I was about the same length yeah
it's longer than the PCIe cable so you
should be able to reach in anything but
the tallest most ridiculous full tower
case you should be able to go around the
back of the motherboard and plug into
the top of the motherboard okay next
finally not finally but also we have
theta so we have a three SATA cable ok
that's a modular cable we have another
three SATA cable we have another three
SATA cable and that is it so since those
are all the same i'm just going to take
one of them and i'm going to show you
guys the size or the length rather ok so
there you go they look a little bit
something like that alright and then
we've only got a couple molex months but
that's fine so we've got to a 23 molex
cables and then we have these are these
are handy we've got one of those molex
two floppy adapters just in case you
still have something in your system that
uses floppy power we can't we have four
zip ties for cable management four
screws for attaching the power supply to
the case and now let's have a look at
the unit itself has a very nice
aesthetic to it I mean I'm obviously
that is subjective but I personally
really like it bold yellow here bold
yellow here and then otherwise dark
blacks and grace kales looks really
really sharp there's the one hundred
forty millimeter fan you can clearly see
the internals of the power supply itself
including the modular interface which is
very low profile actually it looks
really good and the solder points on the
back are very clean interesting ok
moving along to the other side you can
see ocz has thought of everything see
look it's right side up no matter which
way you install your power supply so you
can either go this way and you can draw
air in from the top if you have a case
that doesn't have ventilation on the
bottom or you can go this way and draw
air up from the bottom of your case if
you do have the ventilation space on the
back we find a honeycomb mesh nice low
restriction mesh an on/off switch as
well as the power input and finally
let's check out the oh this is awesome
ok this
is right here probably the killer
feature other than the load controlled
fan speed so check this out you can plug
in you never see this with the 750 watt
models you can plug in all four of your
PCIe and then you can plug in both of
your EPS connectors so you can power
even super high-end boards and dual
graphics cards without any adapters
because the reality of it is 750 watts
is enough for most systems out there but
a lot of motherboard are a lot of power
supply manufacturers give you one eps
socket and for PCIe forcing you to
either use single eps and two graphics
cards like if you have a high-end
motherboard that takes two eps
connectors or they make you put the
other eps into one of the PCIe and you
use up ah to beat the EPS that way and
then you only have three PCI Express
adapters left which means you can't do
dual graphics cards which if you're
buying a motherboard that has 28 pins
i'm pretty sure that unless you have a
server board you're probably going to
want a couple graphics cards in there so
there you go that's pretty cool next we
also have their five modular spots for
the sada one two three city and to
Molech so you can plug in all of the
included cables without in difficulty
and finally we have the ATX connector
here which is pretty self-explanatory so
