exciting product now this has sort of a
more value oriented price point compared
to something like a ZX series which is
80 plus gold and fully modular and like
lots of good stuff it's really good
power supply but they're expensive so
this is the ZT series which has sort of
90% of what the ZX series has but at a
lower price point so it is a fully
modular power supply with a five-year
warranty 80 plus bronze is still pretty
darn good on a yearly scale we're
talking probably about six to seven
dollars of difference assuming you're
running your computer at like full mode
like many hours per day you can go back
and check out on my NCIX comm channel
the episode I did about 80 plus gold
where I compared the cost of running a
non 80 plus power supply with an 80 plus
gold power supply and I gave sort of a
couple different scenarios and yeah the
cost is not that big of a factor as long
as it's a nice high quality unit then
you are going to be getting the
performance you need out of your PSU so
inside the box we find a manual which is
actually surprisingly thick look at that
okay so it talks a little bit about EU
Plus efficiency level certification so
80 plus bronze is 82% at 20% 85 % at 50%
82% at 100% okay and that's at 115 volt
which is what we use in North America so
you 80 plus gold is about five percent
more efficient across the board but as I
said before it's really not the end of
the world however you know what this
chart really outlines one of the reasons
I tell people not to over buy on the
power supply because if you buy a 1500
watt power supply and you're using 300
watts at idle which you're not because
most computers use about 100 to 150
watts at idle you're getting less than
anything on this chart in terms of the
efficiency that your power supply is
rated for you're not even in the sweet
spot which is about 50 percent so
connector specifications here we can
look at the specifications I suppose max
output on the 12 volt rail is hold on
that soap
okay hold on a second you know what
let's just look at the side of the power
supply because it's a less complicated
chart here's a bunch of different
languages which I do not care about but
somebody does and that's why they're
there all right next we have the power
supply itself and I haven't forgotten
about the cables we will go back and
look at the cables later I just wanted
to see once we get the little baggie
opened up here hey it's got a 140
millimeter cooling fan oh it doesn't
oh yeah there's okay so on the 12 volt
rail we can do up to 744 watts so you
can do almost the entire output of this
750 watt continuous rated power supply
on the 12 on the 12 volt rail which
means that no matter what you throw at
it in terms of graphics cards or where
you plug them in because this is a
single 12 volt rail power supply you
will get the full output that it is
rated for so I'm being a little bit a DD
today but I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna
put the power supply itself back down
and I'm gonna go back to the box because
I just want to see if in this unboxing I
missed anything okay so they've got
ratings for the cable lengths which is
good to know there's not Turner was
looking for continuous output radio
demanding 45 degrees Celsius ambient
temperature Wow so they're reading this
power supply at a completely unrealistic
temperature and not unrealistic in a bad
way unrealistic in a good way if this
delivers the performance they say it
does at that temperature I guarantee you
it's performing better than they say at
a room temperature which is going to be
less like what about 20 23 degrees
Celsius sort of in that range single 12
volt rail we already talked about that
premium loius are 105 degrees Celsius
electrolytic capacitors compliant with
HX v 2.2 okay large temperature and load
control this is cool so the fan on here
most fans are temperature controlled on
power supplies this one is load
controlled so what that means is your
fan is actually going to start spinning
faster as soon as your computer is
drawing more juice from the power supply
why is that important because it means
that your power supply will never heat
up any higher than it has to because
it's already predicting that there is
more load on
components and they're going to heat up
it is cooling them before they even need
to be cooled very neat all right next we
have 80 plus bronze which we talked
about already and bunch of sort of
safety stuff over voltage or over
current over power and short-circuit to
protect your components five-year power
swap warranty remember when the power
swap warranty first launched that was
with the OCZ
before the mod Xtreme this was power
stream yes with the power stream power
supply so that means that you do not
have endless repair returned for repair
loops they just send you a new one no
big deal that is pretty much it with the
box okay now we're gonna go back to the
cables so we've got a big gold fat
computer cable here so what is this
trying to find out how thick it is why
don't I just tell you guys it's thick
and it's ul certified so probably safe
next we have some PCIe cables EPS yeah
that's EPS okay got other more different
EPS cousin more different PCIe I'm just
gonna sort these into what they are and
then we'll come back to them in a minute
okay so first thing we find is our
24-pin connector so these are clearly
labeled PSU and then like not PSU ATX so
that goes into your motherboard cable
lengths I wouldn't have any concerns
with a premium power supply like this
but I'm go ahead and check it anyway
there you go got a nice long 24-pin
connector so even if it's a button
sorry about that guys we ran out of
memory so this will be adequate length
for you whether you have your bottom
mounted power supply whether you want to
go around the back of the motherboard
tray come with the front whatever the
case may be nice long 24 pin cable never
hurts when you are building a machine
all right what else we got so PCIe
cables here let's have a look at the
lengths of these PCIe cables tend to not
need to be very long because whether you
have a bottom mounted power supply or
whether you have a top mounted power
supply the distance is kind of the same
so I don't worry too much about that but
there you go that is the length in terms
of Lynas Heights it's about a xiphoid
process to a top of the head sort of
length all right next we have
our eight-penny EPS connectors of which
there are two these look like they might
be a little bit short but let me have a
look actually that's not bad okay that's
pretty good so that's actually longer
than it was about the same length
yeah it's longer than the PCIe cable so
you should be able to reach in anything
but the tallest most ridiculous full
tower case you should be able to go
around the back of the motherboard and
plug into the top of the motherboard
okay next finally not finally but also
we have SATA so we have a three SATA
cable okay that's a modular cable we
have another three SATA cable we have
another three SATA cable and that is it
so since those are all the same I'm just
gonna take one of them and I'm going to
show you guys the size or the length
rather okay so there you go they look a
little bit something like that all right
and then we've only got a couple more X
months but that's fine so we've got two
to three molex cables and then we have
these are these are handy we've got one
of those molex to floppy adapters just
in case you still have something in your
system that uses floppy power we come we
have four zip ties for cable management
four screws for attaching the power
supply to the case and now let's have a
look at the unit itself it has a very
nice aesthetic to it I mean I'm
obviously that is subjective but I
personally really like it bold yellow
here bold yellow here and then otherwise
dark blacks and grey scales looks really
really sharp
there's the 140 millimeter fan you can
clearly see the internals of the power
supply itself including the modular
interface which is very low profile
actually it looks really good and the
solder points on the back are very clean
interesting okay moving along to the
other side you can see ocz has thought
of everything see look it's right side
up no matter which way you install your
power supply so you can either go this
way and you can draw air in from the top
if you have a case that doesn't have
ventilation on the bottom or you can go
this way and draw air up from the bottom
of your case if you do have the
ventilation space on the back we find a
honeycomb mesh nice low restriction mesh
an on/off switch as well as the power
input and finally let's check out the oh
this is awesome
okay this is right here probably the
killer feature other than the
load controlled fan speed so check this
out you can plug in you never see this
with the 750 watt models you can plug in
all four of your PCIe and then you can
plug in both of your IPS connectors so
you can power even super high-end boards
and dual graphics cards without any
adapters because the reality of it is
750 watts is enough for most systems out
there but a lot of motherboards are a
lot of power supply manufacturers give
you one EPS socket and four PCIe forcing
you to either use single EPS and two
graphics cards like if you have a
high-end motherboard that takes two EPs
connectors or they make you put the
other EPS into one of the PCIe and you
use up to beat the EPS that way and then
you only have three PCI Express adapters
left which means you can't do dual
graphics cards which if you're buying a
motherboard that has two eight pins I'm
pretty sure that unless you have a
server board you're probably going to
want a couple graphics cards in there so
there you go that's pretty cool next we
also have here five modular spots for
the SATA one two three SATA and to
Molech so you can plug in all of the
included cables without any difficulty
and finally we have the ATX connector
here which is pretty self-explanatory

supply don't forget to subscribe to
