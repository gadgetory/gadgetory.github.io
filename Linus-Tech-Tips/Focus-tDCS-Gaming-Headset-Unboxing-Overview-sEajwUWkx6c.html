more welcome to my unboxing of the folk
us or focus or whatever you want to call
it their domain is folk dot us and the
objective of this product is to help you
focus I have no idea if it's total snake
oil or if it's an actual thing so I
decided to buy one we did not have this
review sample provided to us I just
forked over the money I'm like okay I
got to see this in action so their
tagline is be fast be focus and the
implication of that is that this will
make you faster and more focus it uses a
technology called tDCS or transcranial
direct current stimulation so while
there may be evidence that tDCS does do
something it's usually in a clinical
setting and it's usually with much
different equipment so this is the first
consumer grade device that has gotten
FCC approval there's no FDA
certification of any sort on it because
it is not considered a medical device it
is being marketed as a gaming device to
help you well focus a little bit better
and whether or not these claims are true
a sort of you know definitely open for
to debate but anyway the point is that
there is it is not being sold as a
medical device so let's go ahead and
open it up find out what's inside the
first thing we get is a couple of focus
stickers maybe just staring at those
will help you focus you never know we
also get a manual and warranty which
shows you how to use it so the default
settings it will do one milliamp for ten
minutes it also shows you on their
website how to apply it to your head and
they sort of similar to this but a
little bit different graphic shows you
how to put the sponges on it really does
feel very space-age ah here it shows you
the available tDCS modes now it should
be noted that not much in terms of
clinical trials has been done on the
default mode that the focus runs in but
if
you get the accessory pack or extras
pack or whatever else it's called you
get a few different things including
some different modes so you get sinus
pulse nose and sham mode sham mode is
exactly what it sounds like it's
actually faking it so that you can do
blind tests and so you can figure out if
it actually has any effect it includes a
bunch of extra sponges so those are
dampening sponges includes whatever
these are some more pads for things more
wires and doodads I extra right these
are the external pads and external leads
so you can actually hook them up a
little bit differently
alright we got more of those again
another little carrying case as well as
evidently a stand for the focus all
right so there's the extras pack at any
rate I was mostly interested in the
additional modes and some of the modes
that it enables I've been a little bit
better investigated there's an app that
allows you to control it so you can use
the touch sensitive controls on the
device itself or you can use an app in
order to adjust from anywhere from 0.8
milliamps to 2 milliamps and anywhere
from five to forty minutes so the app is
coming soon for iOS coming soon for
android and there will be Windows Mac
and Linux ones as well so let's have a
look at the okay I guess so inside here
you get a little bottle for dampening
your sponges you also get a charging
cable it uses micro USB because
everything does these days even though
it's a big piece of crap and you get a
set two sets of sponges now our focus
appears to have arrived damaged which is
very disappointing
but I can see what happened here I may
attempt a DIY repair but I would have
hoped that that buying something that's
a commercial product versus a DIY
product I would have been able to you
know just use it out of the box moving
over to the back of the unit we find the
touch sensitive buttons so these ones
are for adjusting things up and down
this can be used in any number of
different ways whether it's to start
bluetooth pairing it flashes the logo
over here either blue or red or fading
or breathing or whatever to signify
different modes and different settings
as you as you're adjusting things
wouldn't have minded a little on-screen
display because I think that would may
life a little bit easier down here we
find the charging port as well as an
on/off switch and the port for the
external electrodes which were included
with our extras kit so you can either
plug in one of them just like that so
this is a single single lead or there's
a there's one that comes with with dual
leads so there you have it now it should
be noted that focus does not recommend
using this thing for anything other than
sedentary gaming so it's not like oh I
want to be better at you know playing
hockey so I should you know use this
thing for a little bit and hope that
that's the effect that it has they are
expecting you to just use it for gaming
so we'll see how long it takes someone
to use it for something other than
gaming they say there's quite a few you
know various side effects that you could
experience nausea headaches fatigue
visual artifacts if you experience any
of these side effects top your session
you may feel tingling hot or cold
sensations if they become uncomfortable
painful stop your session so basically I
mean from from sort of a pure common
sense perspective zapping your brain
with electrical sort of you know
nonsense just seems kind of insane but
I'm definitely going to try it out and
we will be following up once we get a
working unit with our impressions of the
focus once we've had a chance to sit
down and try it out a little bit so very
very exciting guys thank you for
