something very specific they want the
fastest machine that I can build for
exporting videos and they want it in the
server room so that they can just remote
into it and export their projects
directly from Premiere instead of going
from premiere to Sena form and then
having a separate machine take it to
h.264 so I kind of went okay only one
small problem with petabyte project
coming space in our rack is at something
of a premium and if you want the fastest
machine I can build I want to overclock
it but I've only got to use to do it so
what's the solution water cooling
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to Tritonal
bear for free check out the link in the
video description so believe it or not
water cooling servers is actually a
pretty common thing but as with anything
that we do around here there's a right
way to do it and there's a wrong way to
do it
so the right way to water coolest server
is to buy a server or usually server
solution that is designed to be water
cooled so typically that'll be servers
that plug in with quick disconnect
fittings to a cabinet or even an entire
room or building that has giant heat
dissipation units located on the outside
the wrong way to do it as the regular
viewers have probably already figured
out is the way that we're going to go
about this is to just grab an
off-the-shelf server and juryrigg some
liquid cooling into it ah come on out
you bastard
ok so let's meet our victim then shall
we ah I actually threw this box together
during our server maintenance weekend
yesterday and the day before the day
before that it was a long weekend just
to make sure that it was all working
before I went in water cooled it so in
here we've got a sous x99 deluxe - we've
got a core i7 69 50 X Extreme Edition 10
core we've got a knock to a cooler
that's clearly got to go I mean I love
Noctua but not going to be suitable for
that CPU we've got 32 gigs of corsair
dominator platinum painted orange ram
we've actually got a gtx 980 in here
that's about all we need for video
acceleration and then i wasn't sure what
to do on the boot drive I actually have
a PCI Express SSD down there just to see
if it was going to work in that second
slot but I think we're going to go
with these two guys in raid one yes I
know they're refurbished yes I know
they're old but it's rave one it should
be okay so now I need some water cooling
gear normally I would reach out to all
the usual suspects and get them to send
over some cool stuff but this project
was not planned out at all so what I'm
stuck with is just kind of going through
the shelves here and seeing what I can
find some of this is what I would have
used anyway like the Primo chill
advanced LRT tubing I found some in red
ah but some of this stuff is a very
random mishmash of what I had on the
water cooling shelf so here's a d5 pump
with the top from ek that was from a
previous project here's a phobia
reservoir that's just the smallest tube
reservoir that I have on hand here's an
old Alfa cool rad that I found and
finally this is an interesting story
I take pride in completing the sponsored
projects that I asked for hardware for
and over two years ago I asked bit's
power for a very specific set of
fittings for a water-cooled BitFenix
prodigy built and I never delivered it
for a number of reasons and so I've just
kind of shamefully looked at these every
time I've gone through the fittings box
having not really any use for all these
like 45s and right angles that only had
two straight fittings in it but that all
changes today because I finally have a
project that I can use them for so stage
one is to kind of tear everything out
that I already had in there and have a
look at the space for working with this
was actually our old router case and as
you can see there is a lot of wasted
space for like five and a quarter inch
drive bays these fans that are just kind
of hanging out in the middle of nowhere
we're still going to need intake fans
but a lot of this space could be
utilized for something else but I still
have some concerns so we've got an ek
supremacy Evo block I'm using the
all-metal version we don't want to take
any on
necessary risks with leaks since this
will actually be sitting above petabyte
project and I just wanted to make sure
that it's actually going to fit in the
2u height with our 90 degree fitting so
that's good then same thing metal caps
for the end of our tube reservoir I need
to find somewhere to put that which
looks like it's going to be right about
here and then I need somewhere to put my
radiator and it looks like we've got a
small clearance issue there but nothing
we can't resolve so this is great
everything came out really easily giving
us actually more space what we're gonna
do is actually sub in a triple radiator
where I had intended to use a dual
radiator now the mounting though is
going to be a little bit tricky we're
actually going to raise it a little bit
off the bottom of the case then we're
gonna have the fans blowing up this way
and we're gonna have these three fans
carrying the air through the case as a
whole
bear in mind guys this is a triple
radiator and we don't have enough room
to cool the video card anyway so it's
only responsible for cooling the CPU so
there are a couple of things you're
gonna notice me doing about this build
that would be a little bit different
than normal number one is I'm going to
be using everywhere that I can so on the
radiator on the CPU block and on the
reservoir actually I'm going to be using
vice grips to tighten up these knurled
fittings like this because I cannot risk
a leak and as long as we are screwing
into metal there's no danger other than
to the finish on the knurled fittings
the other thing you're going to notice
is that I'm going to be optimizing for
the shortest possible tubing runs
wherever I can because no matter how
good your tubing is it will be slightly
porous and that's where water evaporates
from a water cooling system
so I'm gonna have as little of that
exposed as possible now I'm getting
really excited I think I finally got a
pretty solid plan for how this is going
to come together so I need some kind of
riser for this reservoir to make sure
that it is high enough that the pumps
Inlet is going to be easily fed by it
then that conveniently gets me right up
to the same level as this right angle
coming off the radiator that will go
back into the res very cool stuff then
the CPU is easy this tube looks like
it's just going to fit under the
graphics card and this one comes right
over here giving me a total of only
about like two feet and change of
exposed tubing mounting everything to
the bottom of the case is extremely
important and needs to be very precise
if I screw up the placement just a
little bit for the radiator the pump and
the reservoir they aren't all going to
fit the other thing that's going to be
really tricky down here is the fact that
this is a rack mounted case so I can't
just have like the head of a screw
sticking through here it'll bump on the
next one down so what I've got are these
sunken tight screws here and the plan is
to use what is not a proper bit for
metal but I only need a few holes out of
it but I'm going to use one of these
steps style drill bits to see if I can
create a countersunk hole as best as I
can yes I know it's not a hundred
percent the best way to do it but come
on you're watching - tech tips we're
gonna pre-drill a hole in the red to tap
into
Oh Shh went too far
hit the tube well hi I'm not sure if I
could be more pissed off right now
so the bad news is that we punctured the
radiator and I don't have another one of
the same but the good news is that that
hole that I was drilling these screws
thread in and kind of self tap perfectly
nice solid connection the plan would
have worked perfectly if I had just put
something back I thought I could control
it but it slipped so I have to fix this
now which means the best solution we
have on hand is marine epoxy claims to
bond brass so I have mixed it thoroughly
for one minute I have actually done this
before with j-b weld that radiator
continued to work for years but I've
never tried using epoxy so here we go
this is how you can tell the difference
in my videos between a problem and a
problem that will go there for a bit
let's get the pump and res mounted we
now return to you live from problems
Linus was expecting to have to solve
okay so when we try and close the lid
we're gonna see that there's a bit of a
bit of a bulge so to speak I can't have
even that little bit of play it's only
about this much fortunately this mount
for the pump has a little bit of
unnecessary thickness at the bottom I
think we can just remove bought the
sticky kind when we need the velcro cut
no problem this is just a finer grit
than I had wanted to use it'll just
I should have just mounted the radiator
with double-sided tape why did I screw
through it anyway
cart before the horse let's find out if
it fits perfect no bulge whatsoever
alright I was bound to be successful at
something not having a good day today
it's ok I always pull it off
usually oh man did you see those
scissors Bend always pull back before
trying to insert yep I am never too mad
to make a dick joke maybe we should just
call this video problems Linus could
solve easily if he had enough time to
wait around for a 3d print job I need
spacers I need spacers for my screws so
I found this old acrylic CPU block hold
down and I am cutting it up to get holes
these may be the dankest spacers of all
time ah shoot just call this video Linus
being grumpy for 20 minutes so as long
as everything stays in place exactly
perfectly the radiator is in making real
progress now we're getting close here we
are again a 3d printed mount would be a
perfect solution for our reservoir but
no time so it came to me
minecraft boom
brick boom another brick oh yes wait is
that too high
ah back to the drawing board
we'll use this square hockey puck okay
not my straightest cut
we have a big problem we are like done
it's time to power it up and this this
is how set our epoxy is clearly that's
not enough but possibly fractal design
to the rescue fractal has removable
fittings from the components of their
AIO but what I don't know yet is if
they're using G 1/4 threads if they are
then I can just swap this radiator in it
is it is right it's right we have
another red love tap
love tap now I'm having fun Oh could
that have been any easier oh yes in
there just fine we've got our tubing run
all our fittings are tightened - all
that's left to do is throw in our
network card throw in our graphics card
wait what is this really gonna interfere
with this oh come on now vicious bastard
okay well this computer doesn't yet ten
gigabit networking SSDs and one tape it
down and a to tape it on top of the
other one power for the SSDs one molex
connector over here 24-pin power oh
we're close now maybe you got to make
sure everything here is nice and flat
because this graphic card does not have
a lot of clearance here and you go okay
that is a primo rat's nest right there
moment of truth
okay so this is it it's finally done the
pump was dead to replace that anyway the
project is a success
so our hottest core after about 20
minutes of sitting running small FFTs
and I 264 is 60 degrees which is pretty
darn impressive given how low-profile
this sucker is what a project anyway
