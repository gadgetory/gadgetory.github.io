Coolermaster featuring the site and 240
millimeter all-in-one cpu water cooling
system check it out at WWE roster USA
calm welcome to my unboxing and first
look at the cream of the cream of Zedd
78 boards this is the Maximus 6 extreme
from a soos it includes everything
except the kitchen sink but it's ok
because you can probably get rid of your
kitchen sink and swap it out with one of
these guys this is the OC panel and it's
got a lot of cool functionality that
we're going to get into throughout this
video the motherboard comes with full
versions of Kaspersky and daemon tools
which I think is a really cool value add
for enthusiasts to buy it on the outside
of the box a soos does a really good job
of spelling out exactly what makes the
board special so there's the OC panel
the N PCIe combo 2 as well as the
extreme engine did you plus three
technologies covered on the inside of
the front of the box which we'll cover
in much more detail once we get the
board out and then on the back they've
got pretty much the same stuff they talk
about four-way SLI and crossfire as well
as some of the connectivity on the board
so let's go ahead and get this bad boy
opened up now the extreme board is
positioned more for overclockers than
specifically for gamers so you're going
to find some of the features and some of
the places where a soos has spent a lot
of time and a lot of money developing
this board are more beneficial to those
guys who are looking to push for every
last megahertz of frequency on their CPU
and not so much towards guys who are
just going to kind of dial it into a
safe setting and leave it there which
isn't to say that it won't have safe
profiles it's just you know you don't
get things like a more advanced
seperated part of the PCB for your audio
solution like you do on a formula grade
board with the extreme so let's go ahead
and open up the box of accessories of
which there are many we'll start with
the Q connector which allows you to more
easily plug in your front panel
connectors padded labeled IO shield in
the traditional isus fashion we have the
custom sleeved cable for the OC panel
which plugs directly into the board and
then into the bottom of the OC panel
unit a users guide
you should pretty much look at online if
you need it these are cool
labels for your SATA cables so you can
tell which one is which at both ends as
well as their there we go for our OD
connect they've got a USB a to a cable
so if you don't want to use the OC panel
then you can actually plug into a
separate computer like a laptop and
control settings from there 3-way SLI
bridge four-way SLI bridge two-way SLI
bridge all black all matte all gorgeous
and finally a crossfire bridge that is
in the same style now this is really
nice check this out Republic of gamers
deckle for your case that unlike most
case decals actually has some heft to it
and feel solid and attaches with a
magnet so that it doesn't it's not a
one-time-use thing we have the N PCIe
combo port M PCIe combo 2 rather excuse
me module that sits on the M PCIe port
at the top of the board more on that in
a moment it has both Wi-Fi dual band AC
as well as Bluetooth 4.0 built-in 8 say
2 3 6 gigabit per second cables which
crazily Note 10 bago you got enough for
every single port on the board and
finally an external magnetic antenna for
the built-in AC Wireless last but not
least we have a five and a quarter inch
bay adapter for the OC panel itself so
you can put the LCD in the front of your
case if you don't want to have a little
separate thing sitting next to you or
you're not operating on an open test
bench which leads us to our second black
box the first thing we see inside of
which is the OC panel now the OC panel
can work in a number of different ways
and I'll start with one of the most
basic things and that is the fact that
this LCD can tilt up so that it can be
mounted in that five and a quarter inch
adapter that I showed you before giving
you access to things like your level up
button which turns your overclock on and
off with a hardware switch here power
button fan control and all kinds of
other cool functionality that can be
enabled with this device we'll get into
more depth with it once we've had a
chance to be hands-on and really play
with it when we're doing our Haswell
overclocking guide so stay tuned for
that guys it's going to be awesome the
other way to use it is sitting on your
desk popped out
like this where it looks a lot like how
many guys would have a multimeter or
something like a temperature sensor
sitting next to them while they're
overclocking speaking of temperature
sensors this is very cool
it actually uses their sub-zero Sense
technology is what they're calling it to
detect temperatures that are as low as
liquid nitrogen so this is suitable not
only for making changes to your clock
speeds or whatever else but also for
actually monitoring those so it's a
serious tool meant for people who are
actually at the top of the field in
terms of overclocking an extreme mode
has other cool stuff about it like VGA
Hotwire which allows you to actually
directly over volt supported Asus
graphics cards with this unit as well
and I mean there's all this cool stuff
here to check this out so inside here
you've got so you've also got a SATA
power in in addition to the data which
allows you to hook up some four pin PWM
fans that you can run off the OC panel
itself as well as control things like
slow mode what slow mode does is
sometimes liquid-nitrogen overclockers
don't want the PC to boot up as fast as
possible so slow mode is there for that
pretty much more than anything else as
well as some other really cool things in
here including there you go direct
voltage check points that are again
built into the board but also built into
the OC panel itself not everybody needs
that functionality though I got briefed
on this thing by Andre yang himself and
so what he did is he helped design it if
you guys know overclocking I hope you've
heard of Andre yang and he also spent a
lot of time with it once it was done
creating profiles that less advanced
users can just implement so all you
really have to do is go okay well I want
to be able to you know monitor my fans
and monitor my temperatures and make
small tuning adjustments by pressing the
buttons on it and that's all fine and
good and cool but at the end of the day
you know maybe what I end up doing is
plugging in one of Andre Yang's profiles
and going at it from there so it has a
more basic mode available to you as well
which leads us to the board itself now
the first thing I noticed about it might
seem weird to you but that's that it's
in a standard ATX form factor this time
around no extra width which we do
normally see on the extreme level boards
next it up and I mean the
okay overclockers are always looking at
what has Asus done in terms of power
delivery to make it so you can eat every
last bit out of the CPU so we see
something we've seen for a couple
generations now and that's dual CPU
power connectors in this case an eight
pin and a four pin and we also see a
completely redesigned voltage delivery
system we've got their super premium 10k
black metallic solid state capacitors
that isus figures are good for up to
five times the life time of what you'd
see from a typical cap and are capable
of operating it up to 20% higher
temperature tolerances but that's not
the only thing that's optimized
temperature-wise here the next FET
MOSFETs operate at 90% efficiency
meaning very little power is lost to
heat and their black-winged chokes due
to the design of the wing on them are
able to operate up to three to five
degrees cooler so the idea is that while
it's completely over built in terms of
how much power can deliver to the CPU it
is not sacrificing any of the efficiency
and cool operation that you would want
from the power delivery system now the
CPU socket itself is an LGA 1150 socket
supporting the latest fourth generation
Intel Core series processors code-named
has well and over here you're going to
find for ddr3 dual channel memory slots
now something notable about has well is
that much higher frequencies of ddr3 are
supported however once you start to
overclock the CPU you know the ddr3 2800
megahertz to 3 gigahertz speeds that
you'll typically get on a hat on a good
Haswell chip are going to start to go
down to the point where once you're
overclocking the CPU to the max your RAM
overclocking options are going to be
somewhat more limited up in the top
right we've got a post LED next to this
is pretty cool so asus has built a
custom 3 pin / 4 pin / whatever the heck
this thing is CPU fan header so what it
does is it actually has a separate
little sensor in there that tells the
cutter board whether you're using a
three pin or a four pin fan and then
will adjust the way that it controls
your CPU fan profile accordingly without
any intervention from the user
very very cool also up here at the top
right we've got one of those slow mode
buttons that's built directly into the
board if you're not using the OC
panel start and reset switches built-in
onboard more voltage checkpoints for
pretty much everything you could imagine
so you can use your high-end multimeter
to check all that stuff I love this
feature guys dip switches for turning on
and off individual PCI Express slots on
the board especially once you've got a
bunch of water-cooled GPUs in there
diagnosing a problem with a graphics
card can be an absolute nightmare so
being able to turn them off one at a
time to figure out which one's causing
the issue without taking the cards
physically out is awesome but memo k
button helps you diagnose non post
situations where memory with aggressive
profiles might not post correctly and
our 24 pin connectors in its ideal
location along the right-hand edge of
the board along with a USB 3 connector
in its ideal location along the
right-hand edge of the board we've got
two more there they are a Blackwing
chokes so those are the two that are
providing power to the memory remember
guys with memory frequencies going way
the heck up it's going to be helpful to
be able to deliver as clean power to it
as you possibly can over here we have
six SATA 3 six gigabit per second ports
powered by the Intel chipset and four
powered by an as media chipset giving
you a total of 10 and it should be noted
that if you use the M PCIe combo n GFF
slaughter m dot 2 slot up in the top
left that one of these ports will be
disabled now I want to talk about that
for a moment now so they include a
module here so this is mini PCIe and USB
2 connectivity that's in here so they
include a module there you go that gives
you Bluetooth 4.0 as well as wireless
802.11 AC however it should be noted
that it does support the m dot 2
standard so you would be able to plug an
SSD in there as well instead of having
it plugged into a SATA port down here at
the very bottom of the board we've got a
BIOS which as well as our front panel
connectors two USB 2.0 connectors the
ROG external connector for the OC panel
a Thunderbolt header meaning you can use
an add-in Thunderbolt card to add
Thunderbolt connectivity to this board a
direct key button the fastboot button as
well as your audio header now I
mentioned before it doesn't have
a similarly high grade audio solution
like what you might find on a formula
board but I think the assumption from
Asus is if you are spending this much
money on a motherboard and the
associated hardware that goes with it
you're probably buying something like a
Phoebus to put in it anyway alright now
this is one of the things that really
gets me geeking out about this board
we've got four PCI Express 16x slots
okay fine there's another one here
that's wired for 8x and then we've got a
PCI Express 4x slot but what's unique
about these is the flexibility that they
afford normally on a non x79 or a non
not premium tier platform from Intel
you've either got 16 X or 8 X 8 X or 4 4
I don't think they even support 4 4 4 or
you'll have some kind of splitter lane
splitting chip that will allow you to
achieve higher bandwidth but at at a
latency penalty that usually doesn't
really result in better performance what
asus has done here is they've given you
the option okay to either run 16 X 8 X 8
X in two slots without using any any
splitters or intermediary bridge chips
so you can get that low latency if you
don't need the extra bandwidth or 8 X 8
X 16 X 8 X using a PL X chip so that you
can achieve four-way SLI on the board
and you'll have to take that latency hit
for running so many graphics cards but
at least this way people who are running
one or two don't have to deal with that
love that and if you're running a ton a
graphics card I would recommend using
the easy plug right here that does
provide some additional power to the
board so that you don't risk burning out
your 24 pin which is otherwise relied on
for all the power to those components
other than the plugins that go on the
back of the video card now while the
hardware for audio might not be anything
special compared to the formula grade
board the software is still right up
there so they've got their new supreme
FX 3 software which includes what
they're calling sound Raider which gives
you a visual overlay of where sounds are
coming from in-game without actually
even relying on your ears at all which
would be I mean the the implications are
very cool particularly for people who
don't hear well or have hearing loss in
one year being able to take advantage of
positional audio like that this BIOS
which is a hardware switch that allows
you to well switch between
the to physical BIOS chips that are
integrated on the board so even in the
event of a bad flash you can quickly and
easily switch to a completely different
profile and you can use it to segment
your experimentation profile from your
daily driving profile finally on the
back of the board we've got a CMOS clear
button rog connect button two USB 2.0
ports six USB 3.0 ports a Gigabit
Ethernet port provided by an Intel
chipset that's going to give you less
overhead and less throughput less
overhead and more throughput we've also
got DisplayPort and HDMI ports
supporting up to 4k display outs optical
audio and 7.1 audio out and last but not
least I really do still like to see this
a ps2 keyboard mouse combo port
sometimes ps2 just does work the best on
the back of the board we've got a couple
more coolers for the MOSFETs and that is
pretty much all she wrote about the
Maximus six extreme guys tune in for our
overclocking guide on Haswell which is
