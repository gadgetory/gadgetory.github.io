something very exciting from AMD and
actually it's funny that I should say
from AMD because right here you can see
they've actually changed the branding
finally AMD acquired ATI
way long time ago but now finally
instead of ATI Radeon graphics it is now
officially AMD Radeon Grasset graphics
as of the 6000 series so this is the
Radeon 6870 which is one of the first
two Radeon 6000 series graphics cards it
supports up to four displays in AMD
eyefinity so that's an increase of one
more display from the 58 70 series okay
so that means you can run to off of the
display ports so those are two mini
DisplayPort and then two off of DVI or
HDMI so you've got a total of three
connectors there let's turn this over
and we'll have a look at what it's got
to say about itself on the box so this
is an msi card that means they've got a
lot on here about MSI Afterburner which
allows you to overclock and do optimal
fan profiles all that good stuff
afterburners an awesome piece of
software you've probably seen me use it
on my blog a lot of times it's got solid
caps which means up to ten years of
lifetime they actually calculated out to
twelve years assuming you're actually
gaming 24/7 for all 12 years here's a
couple of highlighted features which I
guess I'll sort of I'll talk about that
briefly while I open the box and we'll
have a look at this card right away
because to be perfectly honest with you
I have not seen this I have never seen
one of these cards this is going to be
my first time just like you nice sticker
actually okay so there it is that is the
Radeon HD 6870 and then here and then
I'm just going to lay this out for you
to sort of for cameraman to look at
while I tell you a little bit more about
it so in terms of we already talked
about the displays out so we have
support for AMD of Evo that's their HD
video and display technology we've got
crossfire X okay we've got only one
crossfire finger up there so that means
we've only got two week crossfire not
3-way crossfire
we have affinity technology with support
for up to
three displays hold on a minute
pause the video blu-ray movie
acceleration by the way that looks like
a typo on the features of the box
because it does support for displays
it's compliant with DirectX 11 which we
already have come to expect and it is
designed for direct compute 5.0 and
OpenCL windows 7 support is a given and
it can accelerate office 2010
applications it supports HDMI 1.4 a
which means that you do have support for
blu-ray 3d playback with the appropriate
software so let's start moving this card
around and have a look at it so as I
mentioned before we've got one crossfire
finger up here at the top for up to two
way crossfire so you can run 268 70s in
a crossfire configuration you've got a
really slick looking shroud on here so
this part is actually metal so what I'm
going to go ahead and speculate actually
here maybe I can see through that um no
I can't really can't really see in there
but I would speculate that this piece of
metal is actually cooling some of the
RAM chips on the front of the card and
then it turns into plastic at this seam
right here as far as I can tell and so
that's just a plastic fan shroud you've
got two 6-pin PCI Express connectors and
then moving around to the back of the
card you've got a continuation of that
pattern that's just going to look really
really sharp in your case whether you
have a case with that where the graphics
cards are installed this way or one
where you've got your motherboard tray
on the other side and installs this way
it just looks really good alright so
let's move around to the business end of
the card where we have two DVI
connectors one HDMI connector now just
like the 55,000 series you can only use
two of these at a time if you want for
displays that means that two of them
will be powered by the mini DisplayPort
connectors which you find here
much like the 5870 it has only a half
exhaust at the back of the i/o panel so
that means that all of the air will have
to be exhausted out that small hole with
the 5000 series it didn't have a huge
impact on the cooling performance so I
wouldn't worry too much about it for
this one because I'd say based on the
overall weight of the car
the dimensions of the cooler the size of
the fan it's probably got pretty similar
thermal characteristics to the last
generation card on the back we find a
slick black PCB now one thing that might
seem like it's missing from a 6870 card
is like a shroud on the back but you got
to remember the 6800 series is not the
equivalent of the 5800 series in terms
of where it belongs in the AMD lineup
this is actually going to be a
performance like a performance card but
not an extreme card this isn't the
highest end series so let's go ahead and
put this down and let's take out what we
have in here in terms of accessories so
first we had a quick user's guide then
we have a driver disk which you may
actually need to use depending on when
AMD releases the drivers on their site
okay driver utility then we had a mini
DisplayPort to display port adapter so
that will allow you to at least run
Eyefinity with three displays if you
don't have any mini DisplayPort monitors
or adapters then you've got two molex to
PCIe 610 power connectors you've got one
crossfire bridge which is all you will
need and you had a DVI to VGA adapter if
you are still using a VGA monitor last
but not least we've got a 6800 series
well another Quick Start Guide by the
look of things shows you how to update
your drivers using their live update so
there you have it the 6800 or 6800
series 6870 from MSI and we're going to
be doing a ton of videos about this guy
power consumption length review all that
good stuff so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
