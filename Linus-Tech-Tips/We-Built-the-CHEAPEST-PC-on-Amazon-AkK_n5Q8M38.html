oh you know this case no I don't okay
okay so should we start with should we
start with Pat yeah let's take it out of
the box I guess like the idea here is
we're just gonna build this thing yeah
okay and you've never built it before
nope so a lot of the time when writers
prepare a video they they do a lot of
the preparation yeah I heard that they
do that ahead of time
uh-huh but today we're just yellowing it
yeah well that it's it's fun to prepare
but you know it's it's fun to keep life
spicy too that sounds like that sounds
like mistake number two yeah
high-end pcs are pretty cool
yeah they can trace raise with the best
of them but they have one major problem
they're expensive most people don't
think about that that's what we're here
for
but we did so we set out to build the
least expensive PC possible with
components that we could buy on
amazon.com yep I literally went to
amazon.com searched the name of the
component sorted by price and ordered
whatever was cheapest at that time and
this is it so it's time to figure out
whether what we ordered was an actual PC
or whether we made a horrible mistake
speaking of horrible mistakes not
checking out our sponsor for today's
video
ant lion bear new mod mic Wireless
features a low latency high-quality
connection LED status indicators up to
12 hours of battery light and more check
it out at the link in the video
description
okay so I couldn't just go to amazon.com
and literally pick the cheapest option
because they have to be compatible
probably if this is the cheapest case
and this is the cheapest board then
we're just going to have to put them
together it's only fair
so this is a LGA 775 socket motherboard
it's a dell poweredge server board okay
yes so and that's gonna be compatible
with our CPU which is a Core 2 Duo II
8400 from Intel are you sure what that
that's going to be compatible most
server boards from that generation where
LGA 771 that is a good point I've never
seen that before and this is a locking
floppy disk oh cool this is locking IDE
oh cool do you want to come in and get
some close-ups of oh so this is an
insignia it doesn't weigh much more than
the box is it tray oh wow you know what
I since I'm tired of being dumped on
look at this it's a hard drive that's
probably perfectly functional I'm pretty
sure it's new why are you asking me
questions like that test I didn't know
they still made 160 gig hard drive we
have a single ddr2 Tim that is 2 gigs
big this is not ECC and this is a server
board oh my god
no it's it should it should sub and that
says memory ECC DDR doing chipset that's
not the socket weight frontside bus 800
megahertz for Pentium 4 we'll hold on a
second this might actually be 775 but oh
my god this is a Pentium board I don't
believe this will work with a Core 2 Duo
the graphics card is a blazing fast AMD
Radeon 6350 all right how much did this
cost us this cost us a whopping actually
2888 Wow it's the most expensive part
out of all of them which is great news
to hear when it might not even work you
know this is not DVI right yeah this is
a different port that is everyone knows
is not DVI you have actually done
something today that hasn't happened in
a while you've shown me three tech
things that I have never seen before in
a single sentence that could be the
title of the video I've never seen this
before this port these like my keys
doohickeys on the IDE things you this
cooler mount oh you've never seen that
I've never seen that see and I've never
seen it either yeah well we do have some
other processors that might work Linus
look at these wonderful selection of
Pentiums
and one seller on so a lot of these are
newer new pentium old pentium pretty lit
okay here's what I think we have to do
you know I have to order the cheapest
one from Amazon that's true we have to
stay true we have to yeah dan stand
strong ok so there's gonna be some movie
magic yeah and I will get back to this
next week I guess so this is attempt
number two wait this is the old stuff
are we even using this anymore
yeah no we're not using that put that
away I never want to see it again this
is also meant for a pre-built system
right but as you can see it's a little
more of a normal layout motherboard
meant for it's a regular micro ATX form
factor yeah yeah yeah
it actually has front panel connector
becames yeah it's so we can short yeah
we're gonna have to guess at them a
little bit but at least there's
something to guess at indeed Wow even a
PCI Express 16x lot this time good job I
did it you still gotta say the grass
cart of doom-- here same 80 AMD Radeon
6350 with a DMS connector so we know
what the connectors called EMS 59 DMS 59
DMS gonna give it to you though this
connector curiously is one that's meant
to drive to displays by default so
that's why I both adapters go from one
DMS 59 and to two of the other thing
yeah
VGA all digital interface okay what else
did we change a and the last one we got
we changed was the RAM we have real ddr2
non-ecc Ram
cool I was a problem we had a server
board it was only compatible with ECC
Ram also this is need er three you know
this right what we's up mode I rabbit
written in the script ddr3 alright I'm
just okay so everything's here
yep should we build it I I hope we can
they they fit in the holes it's like
they were actually designed to fit
together pal yeah boom Kapow yeah dual
channel baby four gigs of ram yep we
paid eight dollars for four gigs last
time right and now we're up to 18 18 so
$10 more so we paid an extra $13 but to
be plus the adapters which I actually
don't have in here minor detail but I
think they were like $3 hey ok it's kind
of coming together now it looks like
this might be a PC whoo whoa
I mean that's not a great indicator but
it's on which is farther than we got
last time
sweet music yeah oh man I need like a
piece of tape or something so annoying
what new ramp yeah it's worth the shot I
honestly don't think it's ramble let's
give it a shot
this is pretty much our most compatible
ddr3 ram this rip rip jaws Z stuff okay
everybody
okay so I got a tray full of
lg8 I think there are a LGA 775 Pentiums
and the $69 gaming PC cuz that I think
it had a he's 7500 in it below yeah okay
sure yet let's uh you know what that
seems promising that is yes that's a
7500 oh well let's try that first
uh-huh do we know that this one works it
was that was what was originally in the
$69 campus great I was there and I was
there too alright I don't even have to
put the heatsink on to know if this work
- any better okay I can have the RAM
from $69 gaming PC - let's just
eventually we just put all the
components in here Samsung Samsung
quality here what's the different beep
why it's a different beep this is HP OEM
memory
Anthony checked it Anthony
should have known better that's the
memory you have Riley by was HP memory
no no no no okay wait I don't want to
get him Oh II am system builders you in
a couple of different ways wait first
they do with their motherboard making it
not compatible with other things then
they key with your upgrade components
because they want you to buy their
specific upgrade compatible thing to put
in their system but then they also you
again when you try and buy their thing
and put it into some other system so
every memory module has what's called an
SPD Chapel and what that has is all the
information that the system needs about
the memory and they can actually program
it in such a way that it's like Oh
that's not the system I was expecting
now I'm not saying that that was
necessarily what happened here because
this board also spat out that g.skill
memory yeah
so it could be the board yes but it
could also been the memory yes either
way okay
so we're gonna put the e 7500 aside for
now
oh we're gonna put your car to do a back
in here and see if that works yeah I
want to put this RAM back in just to see
nope
No you ready for a graphics card I am
ready for this and did you I mean you
must have known you must have known that
this is what this video was you thought
it'd be smooth
smooth sailin buy the cheapest that you
totally go buy the cheapest thing you
can possibly find on Amazon and you
ought to be hunky-dory
I honestly what I kind of expected was
for you to buy the cheapest brand new
things and I had meant the cheapest
thing in a given category but like I'm
2018 new yeah wait in a box with a
manual and an i/o shield well we could
do that that'd be there yeah yeah we
could keep this PC on Amazon part two I
swear it's less cringe this
Oh oh my hey not bad
is it gonna make it all the way to the
desktop
- tech tips tech tips
I am vindicated is welcome welcome to a
fan PC do we have a Gigabit LAN you can
it is it's gigabit its Broadcom and net
extreme gigabit that's the good kind
okay so the first thing we want to know
is what exactly the crap graphics card
this is I know what it is I have that
information look you can actually look
it up faster than I can check in device
manager because of how slow this thing
is it's a Radeon 6350 turns out this is
actually a Radeon 5450 so it might have
been mislabeled on your listing there
but that's what it shows up I got
swindled get um nice dude huh okay let's
move on let's move on to dota 2 dota 2
was what we really wanted here you know
we we do this and figure stuff out so
you don't have to guys we save you from
having to deal with eight frames per
second in the loading screen you thought
anthem was bad it still is 30 frames per
second 720p second lowest settings I
don't know there's three main characters
on screen there's not that many there's
not that much ago no there's really not
much but still like this is playable for
a MOBA like 30 frames a second
yeah with BOTS offline it's playable
that's true
bump the bump the settings down to
lowest can you do that in game well
we're up to 50 oh and it looks even
worse somehow at the lowest settings and
720p okay let's try a rocket League
alright 30 FPS fps in the menu okay
alright okay Wow Wow it looks really bad
oh you better go to v2 here sir I might
go
wait where is it about difficulty unfair
1v3 oh yeah okay you see you're getting
30fps though so I don't want to hear no
excuses here but Oh oh my gosh this is
like I feel like I'm on drugs right now
oh how we're good for good for good for
you
good ish dude good as old this is really
bad
can you beat three unfair BOTS I have
this is a clinic folks this is how it's
done look at this look at this he's
gonna put the card in the net all right
sports fans this is why we all watch the
game Oh chipper chipper
so what we're discovering here is that
unless you're gonna meet a certain sort
of threshold for how much you're gonna
spend there are certain components that
are expensive to buy standalone like a
case just because of the logistics of
the thing is never gonna cost below a
certain amount you got it you got to
ship it and stuff whereas when you buy
it as part of a bundle it might
contribute very little of the value of
the total PC as we saw with the $69
gaming PC so we stand by our previous
recommendation for low-budget gamers
rather than trying to go on a retail
site like Amazon buy all the cheapest
stuff slapped it together and oh that
you can get it working we'd really
recommend doing what we did last time
buying a already working computer and
then if you've got the budget for it
even down the line applying a few choice
upgrades in order to smooth out the
experience this was a hundred and fifty
dollars just all the parts by itself and
that computer was 30 bucks plus 30 bucks
plus another 60 bucks for a GPU yeah 120
bucks altogether we got as good gaming
there's a way better gaming experience
way better terrible yeah and for those
of you out there being loved
- not everything is about gaming trust
me it's terrible for everything else -
speaking of terrible wouldn't it be
terrible if I didn't tell you guys about
our sponsor for today's video
thermal takes a 500 aluminum mid-tower
case takes a minimalist approach to its
design with a brushed aluminum finish
for a clean uninterrupted look it's
hinged tempered glass panels on both
sides of the case make it easy to show
off your internals while keeping things
classy if you're more into that sort of
thing and the a500 supports radiators of
up to 422 millimeters long in the front
and up to four three and a half or two
and a half inch drives along the left
side panel or on top of the power supply
cover it includes a USB type-c port on
the front IO and you can check it out
today at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
really
thank you for watching thank you for
accompanying us on this painful painful
journey but we had fun didn't we I
learned a lot we had fun if you guys
dislike this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description
also down there is our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join by the way Anthony sent me an email
said he was exonerated by an email that
he found well that's true apparently I
signed off on the memory I confess I
never clicked the link yeah and the
listing for it did not specify that it
was HP specific system specific Ram so
I'm exonerated - so everyone's exonerate
Wow except the Amazon seller that
shipped us that yeah stay away from them
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
