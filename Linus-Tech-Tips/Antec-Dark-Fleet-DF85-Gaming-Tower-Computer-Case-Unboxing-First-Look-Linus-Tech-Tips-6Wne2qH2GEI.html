overview of the antic dark fleet DF 85
this is a full tower chassis and why
don't we do a quick overview of these
teachers that it's includes first of all
you have a tuna half inch SSD slot right
in the top of the drive this runs at
your full state of speed whatever you
hook up to it so that's a pretty neat
feature if you want to plug in SSD into
the front of your case and then we've
also got four external three and a half
inch fleet swap SATA Drive bays so these
are hot swap SATA Bay's that you can
actually move around with in the case
much like the Antec 1200 you can
actually take the whole module and move
it somewhere else if you want these
accept three and a half inch drives and
then we have fleet release drive bay
access to our fleet release basically is
a name for their door that includes a
fan a fan control knob a stepless fan
control knob so you can have the fan run
at any speed you want as well as a fan
filter this gives you access to the hard
drive bays as well as the fleet swap
base next we have USB 3.0 on the front a
single port and it is SSD hard drive
compatible it is designed by an tech in
California and what else do we have on
the outside of the box that I can tell
you about there's a picture of the case
I don't think that's all that relevant
then we've got a big long list of specs
camera down if you want to just have a
look at the spec list they can always
pause it and have a look if they feel
like it three front USB 2.0 ports that's
probably relevant as well as the one USB
3.0 port color coded blue CPU cut out
for easy CPU installation and oh it
accepts EPX power supplies that's pretty
relevant too because an tech cp850 and
CP 1000 are both really good units at a
really good price so let's get this
thing opened up this is my cheat sheet
today by the way because there's a lot
of stuff to remember about this case and
from time to time I do actually try to
learn about the product before I unbox
it rather than just trying to learn on
camera look at this I've prepared
everything today I've got a knife I've
got my screwdriver and I even have an
SSD drive to put into
little SSD slot that is preparation so
first thing we find inside the box is
are you even able to hear me you can
hear me okay
so we find a piece of paper that tells
us this is a product overview and we've
also got some screws okay why don't we
just open this up and see what's inside
okay product overview will only provide
general information shows you what all
that where all that fans are and stuff
and then yeah okay oh hey hey hey this
is cool okay so there's nuts that's the
amount I'll show you that once we get
inside the case and then next we have
some harddrive grommets we got some
thumb screws motherboard screws dried
screws as well as a couple reusable
cable ties Thank You antic cable ties
are always a plus on a new case and I
can't get this out so I'm gonna use the
old trick
draw
Wow it comes in really good foam I'll
give it that much there's a high quality
closed cell phone you can be assured
that you're an tech DFAT five will not
be damaged in transit you've got a good
inch plus of packing material on all
sides and you can see that it arrived in
very good condition when it was shipped
- all right let's get the plastic off
here and the first thing you'll notice
is that it's pretty similar in structure
to the Antec 1200 so it's been upgraded
in a lot of ways but the general shape
is quite reminds me quite a bit of the
Antec 1200 including the side window
here so it does have a side window which
has an optional 120 millimeter fan mount
for a graphics card fan then we have a
some thumb screws on the back so I'm
just gonna get this opened up so we can
have a good look at it why don't we do
them rest to the outside first okay I'll
take that off then we'll take off the
inside one in a little bit here but
let's have a look at the beach release
as well as fleet swap base so first of
all these are the elite really oh man I
can't even remember which is Fleet
released in which is fleet swap help me
okay these are the fleet release base so
these open up somehow okay let's see if
we can figure out how to do it that
would be the key is to figure out how to
open them there has to be a way and it
can't be all that complicated because
you can't call something like fleet like
like fast like Swift and less here okay
well that was easy
does this just come out like that no
well these are easy so these are just
covers for your five and a quarter inch
bays okay so there we go we've got that
much figured out and then we have
okay why don't I try opening up the side
panel first and see if I can figure out
how to get these open so side panel has
a nice clear window on it one of the
things that they have updated since the
1200 is this is no longer mesh this is
now plexi so you can actually see
through the entire window we've got
anti-vibration mounts here for the side
VGA fan so that's pretty good
there we go and let's see if we can
figure out how to open up these days
here so first let's take this Oh wonder
what this does
does that unlock them not yet oh okay
oh it unlocks them oh there we go okay
so all of the fleet release days are
locked by default and then you just open
them up just like that I'm guessing they
become a little bit easier to open as
time goes on but yeah there that's not
that complicated
so now we have access to all of these of
the fans these are washable fan filters
in here 120 millimeter fans you can see
these are an Tek three-speed fans they
are LED fans so those are red LEDs on
red fans with a black frame so they look
pretty cool when they're lit up I'll
make a point of actually lighting up
this case at some point in the future so
I can show it to you guys the other
thing that an Tek is really touting is a
cool feature on this case it's the
stepless fan control right here which is
built-in do all of the front fans and
here is the other really really cool one
and this is fleet swap so right back
here you have to look inside the case
you can see that there are two only two
I thought there were more well there are
two front SATA hot swaps that you can
actually move to any two SATA ports that
you want in the front and there are
actually four I lied
the other two are up here by default so
you can move these around however you
want
actually cameraman if you want to hear
come have a look at them from the inside
you can see that the screws right here
can allow you to just remove these
they're made of plastic but fairly
durable and then you can just put them
wherever you want so you can configure
it so that the hot-swap bays are
wherever you need them to be there you
all use separate power and data cables
so there's no port multiplier involved
there's no there's no power routing from
sort of one plug to multiple ports or
anything like that but it does give you
a very flexible very modular interface
for your drives very cool let's have a
look at what we've got for front panel
connectors here okay well it's tied with
two zip ties for extra added safety and
security okay so for our front panel
connectors we have a USB three which is
intended to go around to the back of
your motherboard so that'll give you
front USB three because the the pin out
is not yet decided for the USB three
standard so if you want a front USB
three that's all you can really do is
run it around to the back of the case so
then the next thing we've got is our
front USB 2.0 reset switch another front
USB 2.0 then we have the front theta
which I will show you in a little bit
more detail in a moment we have power
for the front we have front HD audio we
have front AC 97 audio should we so
desire we have a hard drive led and I'm
gonna go ahead and assume there's a
power switch in there somewhere but I
can't find it for the life of me power
LED come on power switch okay I got this
one this one this one
and power-switch got it excellent so at
the back there are two more 120
millimeter fans these match the color
scheme of the 120 millimeters in the
front so all in all actually that's one
of the probably the best values about
this case is the fact that it comes with
seven fans by default all preloaded into
the case and they're all reasonably good
quality fans - these are all an Tek try
cools I actually don't know if the ones
up top er yeah yeah those who try cools
- and so all the ones at the back are
controlled by switches at the back of
the case so I can get the cameraman to
come have a look at the back here you
can see that the rear fans are
controlled by these switches so they can
be set to either low or high and these
are sliders ooh that's cool so you can
adjust them to whatever speed you want
by the look of things although I could
be wrong so don't quote me on that one
so it might just be low hi that one's
kind of recessed but you can probably
still hit it the top ones are right here
so that controls all the fans at the
back now one disadvantage is that if you
want to replace the fans with something
else that might be a little tricky to
get them to actually work this way
here is our standard i/o plate location
then we have one two three four five six
seven expansion slots so you're going to
fit standard ATX motherboards here are
two water cooling grommets so if you
wanted to mount a rear radiator or
anything like that you'd run the tubes
through there then you've got your
standard ATX power supply hole and then
you can also remove these four screws
and that allows you to mount a CPX power
supply let's have a look around the back
of the case and see if we can find any
interesting cable routing features or
anything like that
you see camera man's pointing at
something I don't know any I don't know
he's on a bus he's pointing at the front
five and a quarter inch bays maybe he
wants me to talk about the five and a
quarter inch people I haven't forgotten
that now he's pointing is something that
I had totally hadn't forgotten he's
trying to remind me of stuff that I know
silly cameraman tricks are for kids now
he's shaking his head at me cameraman
guy given his mac see he wouldn't use
something like this because it's not you
know an apple so you know he doesn't
understand you know why this would be
interesting obviously here's your power
okay
come back so here's your power supply
cable routing goals you've you've got
your power supply mounted in the bottom
so you can run your 24 pin here you run
your 8 pin up here you run whatever
they're called power connectors SATA up
here for the optical drives and then you
can run any SATA cables you want over to
your hard drives over here and then you
can also you know what this is something
else that I should mention I think that
an tech saying you can actually install
another one of these if you don't want
any optical drives and you can just have
4 fans in the front so I don't know
where you buy them but I think that you
can so that might be relevant here's the
CPU cut out nice and big but without
losing any sturdiness you can see
they've peeled back the metal here so
that the edges are all rounded I could
rub my fingers on these all day and I
would not get a cut see I didn't get a
cut I was hoping I wouldn't get a cut
and then let's see the last thing that I
want to talk about is the 140 millimeter
fans on the top those look a little bit
bigger than one I think they're 140 Mill
high the other 140 ml no I'm just crazy
yeah these are 140 millimeter fans try
cools also they spin just like that and
then the last thing that I finally want
to show you let's actually use the hot
sloppy
I'm just gonna take a wd one terabyte
black hard drive then I'm gonna plug it
in and then that is how long it takes to
install a hard drive in the dark fleet
85
once you've already plugged in the
connectors at the back of the fleet swap
modular interface things that you can
move around and finally the real last
thing I want to show you because I lied
last time so here's the power cable that
comes up from the power supply and then
here's a SATA cable that we plugged in
in theory when we were installing our
system and you can plug in this SSD now
I don't know that this is the most
secure way to install an SSD in your
system but I will let you be the judge
of that
the way that I see this being more
useful is actually just if you store
your data on just a regular tuna 1/2
inch notebook hard drive and you just
want to sort of quickly plug it in
instead of you know hauling out a USB
cable or whatever then this would be a
really easy way to plug that in or I
mean hey if you wanted your like if you
want address SD on display for the world
you know Hey look at me look how cool I
am I have a 128 gig SSD EO then it's all
clear so you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
