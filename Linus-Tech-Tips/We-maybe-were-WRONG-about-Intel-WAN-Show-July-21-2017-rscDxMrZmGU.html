really fit that's a she yeah it's we had
show time and we managed together that's
what she said
before the proper insurance for the in
right at the story
we are fast gone like that you're just
like you're thinking you're thinking oh
it's about two said it's over yeah okay
we've got a great show for you guys
today in record speed um first we get to
admit that we were not only slightly
wrong but also slightly ignorant and a
little bit dumb so that'll be coming
later I which I wasn't able to research
at all oh my god this yeah yeah no
that's that's fine don't worry I got
this thanks um HTC's keyboard is showing
ads to users of their phones
apparently might not really be their
fault but it's because of something
whatever whatever we're going to later
so that's brilliant
this just in an asus thread ripper
motherboard there are now unboxing
pictures it looks awesome I've held it
oh it feels awesome I'm sure it does and
the ROG crosshair six extreme has been
announced dunt dunt yeah so yeah I guess
I guess we're drumroll eardrum clang I
don't have twitch open yet nerd did why
damn it haha I believe that is pretty
much the definition of rekt and son
I got it hold on I'm sure we had
sponsors but I have to post that the LAN
show is live on social media that's what
I usually do well if you two savage
Sergey hooks go check it
jingles are a lost art we should we
should make another album
oh okay I've wanted to do a non
Christmas themed album for a while I
know but I didn't we learn our lesson
last time no it did really well okay
well there are different ways to learn
your lesson okay so so for those of you
not familiar unless how it was over a
year ago we go over a year and a half
ago we had the harebrained idea I don't
remember whose idea it was wasn't you
was it me you was it me I'm not taking
full credit for it I'll take partial
credit for other people were complicit
in this and I wait more than completely
I was yeah so then this was a thing that
we as a team create my idea but I
definitely champions yeah okay so we
created a Christmas album we took a
bunch of classic Christmas songs and we
rewrote the lyrics with technology as
sort of a theme and it um it was awful
yeah but the lyrics were actually not as
bad as you might expect because I took
what some other people wrote and made
very few alterations because they were
quite good or not me leave me read it
because they were done by Colton yeah
yeah
John and I sat down like together
outside of work hours and wrote a few
songs that were like pretty solid yeah I
believe Nick Nick lights were maybe
going to did a few yeah
Colton's were terrible they were really
but I was like do you even English bro
they were a little rough so I redid
those ones but anyway and then without
any rehearsal
nacho me
just which like that's a reputable name
right there says that it was actually
fantastic okay thanks nacho man and we
actually sold quite a few of them so I
was I was getting to that part um are
you checking which I'm you're checking
on you know it might mean that we're
going to sell none of them next time
because people have now seen what we can
do yep so so anyway so we we did I think
it was like 9 or 10 song something like
that so we without any rehearsals and
without any screening so no matter who
they were if they were on staff at Linus
Media Group they had to sing for the
Christmas album and we sold how many of
them do we build 924 for a grand total
of two thousand seven hundred and
seventy two dollars so we not even close
to made back the time we spent on it
nope not years also add revenue which I
can look up for you right now what I
don't know if we can see it sure yeah
let's let's I don't think anyone's going
to care okay you know what we may have
actually turned off monetization we may
have turned off monetization because we
wanted as many people as possible to
watch the the video advertising it so we
released it as something that almost
looked like a joke no we did we
monetized it so we released this video
that almost looked like a joke and and
then were way too serious about it and
then you actually could buy it like that
this is this is real this is not a joke
at all look at add back there looks like
it my favorite thing this whole time is
looking at Colton's face this if you see
like the behind the scenes Linus has
just been grilling cold in the whole
time so Colton starts sitting on the
couch I don't even think he's singing
like half the time just completely
deadpan it's great another interesting
thing the reason why I know that this
sold very well
is that I get emailed every single time
someone buys it every time so like every
few months it's not that common anymore
cuz it's been so long right yeah I want
to see this in the download section just
be like what it was buy it for fun so we
brought in another $400 heck from the
two hundred and seventy-five thousand
views on that video that's over three
grand man so that makes you one not one
other one well that was back in in 2015
we probably get more views now okay so
tell you what we've matured and national
hahahahaha I'm going I'm going full on
Dean Spiller here we are not doing
another album like in that form ah you
don't want to you don't want to steal it
I'm not going to tell no I want to make
another album
no no we're not doing another album but
there will be some time in I'm not going
to promise the time frame other than
like in the next few months because it's
a fairly large project and we want to do
it right there will be a tech themed
like fairly high production value music
video coming from Linus tech tips in
that time frame which if it does well
enough might end up being able to go
into an elbow if we do enough of them
okay have you heard the song no there's
a song recorded already the the actual
melody okay no it's already I haven't
heard with some placeholder lyrics very
placeholder but like it's pretty catchy
I haven't heard it it's pretty catch is
this you bet okay oh yeah so it's this
is something that that that we've been
talking about actually for probably
about three years well before the
Christmas elf well before we were in
this office yeah
so that's that's definitely a thing
that's happening other things that are
happening so the 16k gaming set up
I hope I'm not really spoiling anything
but I just came back from filming the
final video for that so that's that's
coming very soon as well it's awesome
and no it is not a baby parody as much
as I would love to do that a baby Perry
baby oh yeah no it's not that
alright so I don't know what just
happened there I don't know wow I don't
know what this I don't know what this is
but actually where this conversation
took place was on my personal Twitter so
the only way I'm going to be able to the
only way up so let's kick the show off
with me kind of admitting that I may
have made a bit of a mistake so first of
all there was the news from tech power
up from last week intel says AMD epic
processors glued together in official
slide deck and to be clear that was far
from the only thing wrong with this
slide deck we we went kind of ham on
intel slide deck being unprofessional
childish undignified you pretty much
name it and I'm not backpedaling on the
bulk of that but there's also a post on
the forum here this is this was posted
by Johnny Johnny
corporal tech and AMD basically produced
a couple slides going like actually okay
you know we have some partners their
partner list isn't as long but at least
it doesn't have any duplicate entries on
it and get them credits the partners
that they do list a pretty big deal yep
but there was something that I did kind
of screw up because I was not familiar
with this particular technical term so
dr. Tetris from a non tech made a point
I can't believe he watches the LAN show
I don't know why he would um I like
thank you yeah thanks Ian hi made a
point of messaging me via DM FYI he's so
polite was it okay so British is it
accurate though
if Ian says so I'm kind of going so
slowly they say it's accurate so here's
what a banger term is different than it
being accurate as we said word for word
FYI glued together is a technical term
okay infinity fabric is a glue logic of
fabric okay and a common semiconductor
microarchitecture term and he linked me
to a Wikipedia article because while he
is a very polite person he's British
that doesn't mean he can't get a little
snarky he's British
you'll see that a lot of semiconductor
research papers to deal with data
movement around silicon or between chips
examples include PCI Express NB link etc
in case you were unaware I feel like and
thanks for the shout out I feel like it
was being used I feel like the way they
were using it in the context of all the
other slides was still pretty b-mode
yeah um and it can it can be a technical
term and that actually makes sense that
it's I'm not surprised at all I thought
it was incorrect because I thought their
form of link I it wasn't applicable to
that yeah
but I think it's still BS but but there
you go
so I'm backpedaling on the outrage over
saying that epic is glued together you
heard it here first but I'm not
backpedaling over the rest of the
nonsense that was in that slide deck I'm
still a little bit for the outrage on
that comment it was it was structured in
a very angry aggressive way I don't know
all right
speaking of outrage HTC's keyboard yeah
is showing ads to its users I mean okay
okay here we go
HTC is working on a fix so what's the
update I love it when they use the term
fix to describe something that wasn't
broken okay to be fair for this
situation touch Pal is the keyboard and
HTC uses touch Pal keyboard so what HTC
thinks is or what people think is going
on here is that touch Pal
ran an update that started serving ads
through the keyboard and HTC was like
whoa what the heck and is now trying to
stop this from happening so I don't
think it was like HTC actively doing
anything I just think it was HTC losing
control of something that they here's
what I don't understand why are they
using touch Pal keyboard I don't know I
don't know I can't that part has
continued to be confusing for me Swift
keys free
yeah well swifty might be free in the
context of an end-user downloading it
but swifty might not be free to a skin
Maker wanting to write but but Google
keyboard Google keyboard is fine and
it's free like it's not my favorite I
don't use it I don't like it
but I don't not like it any more than
any other piece of trash keyboard
Samsung's like Coach Pro terrible I've
never used touch palps I'm not a fan of
touch oh okay yeah they're they're
they're all pretty garbo and the only
reason I like Swift key is because
there's a few little customizations that
I make to it that make it very very
usable so I shortened the long press so
you can get it all your special
characters without switching keyboards
not all but the vast majority of them so
it makes it faster to use I don't I
don't flow type so some people tell me
that Swift Keys flow is not very good
don't care don't flow I don't do it
um and that's that's pretty much it
actually that's pretty much all yeah I'm
at the point where using other keyboards
feels weird but the prediction of Swift
key is fantastic like I can basically
look away and kind of like mash up my
keyboard it seems like did you mean I'm
like yeah pretty much if I'm on a kiddy
party that I don't often use I like
can't type anymore I know because I know
we've all turned like helpless
I like definitely run typos pretty much
all the time and Swift Keys just like
I'll do all this everything will be fine
yeah another creepy thing in that same
vein right now is Google's Auto
predictions for email have you seen that
I've seen it on
seeing it on my on my mobile Adam we did
it on my sweet and then on here send me
an email do you figure yeah well no
maybe I can hold on maybe I got one here
you Pro I don't know here yeah yeah I
got one so on here I get all kinds of
stuff so I can click reply so I can use
voice or I can say okay yes no thumbs up
to my home sad heart law thanks got it
done nice I don't know what why what's
up
okay give me a moment on my way sounds
good big happy face very sad face and a
heart this is too many options
I know go through all that I could take
my phone out in the actual app there's
just three usually um but like I don't
know that I I actually liked it because
it started but in because it's so creepy
that it starting to get really good like
it started I was even talking to John
about it has started suggesting
responses that sound more like something
that I would actually say oh mine hasn't
really gotten any better I don't use it
mine's gotten better huh and I've rarely
used it I think it's just farming the
data from my gmail that's very
interesting like I got one that was like
okay great that's awesome like that's
exactly what I wanted to say so the next
step is when it doesn't even bother
asking you to press the lot just does it
it's just like you can delete it if you
want but it's already there yeah really
pretty epic alright how we got here but
I think we're now on a thread Ripper
mobo and bomb yeah so this is from
videocards dot-com so honestly there's
not a whole lot to it the only thing
that was missed though I've seen the
board already the only thing that was
missing was the accessories but now
we're able to have a look at what is
included so there's some kind of PCI
Express riser card I'm going to guess
that's like am doctor or something what
is the point of doing an unboxing like
this and leaving all the stuff in the
packaging did they really do that okay
so yeah here's an MDOT two riser doodad
four-way SLI bridge why I guess if this
is like a like a just for benchmarking
of products that pretty high-end so
might make sense I'm super surprised
we've got like a GPU support bracket it
looks like we've got Jai normal Wi-Fi
antennas so this is going to have like
AD Wi-Fi I think big page of stickers
the PK Ethernet card this is what I
don't get you know why and this is
coming from someone who actually made
his mark like N and built his career on
unboxing videos why did unboxing videos
ever need to exist when you could just
have this I mean yes this is sort of a
crap job they did of it but like if you
could just have I think it's harder to
do it like you can do a really really
crap job with a video unboxing and it
can still be better than this you know
what I'm saying
but I can see like I've watched a lot
I've watched a lot yeah but don't
necessarily mean no not really hot and
look how much light glint is on these
frickin packaging I mean this is the
biggest one literally has the
anti-static one you can't tell what it
is that's useless this is literally
useless this is also useless so is that
is that a box of something I can't tell
all these other things have like glint
on I can't tell what the vast majority
of these okay all right okay but
assuming this picture wasn't taken by
like but that's the point if it's a
video it'll be moving you'll probably be
able to see better what it is so you'll
be able to okay so you're are you really
making the argument I think you hold on
hold on you're telling me that video is
better because you could watch frame by
frame and maybe C's are like yet where
you could I have her like really weird
niche products I have watched terrible
like cell phone in the hand one hand
unboxing videos of it to try to figure
out what's actually going on and like
kind of scrub through it so I could see
better because it was that bad and it
has answered questions I've been looking
for I've had it work for me okay
alright I'll let it slide on this one
also announced is the crosshair six
extreme so there are they're finally
going full high-end on a m4
so RGB lighting blah blah blah for more
than a decade it really it really does
speak to the industry's confidence in
risin yeah that we're finally seeing
truly high-end boards because I would
have AMD fans complain that like all
good boards for Intel yeah and it's like
yeah because other than like a handful
of people who are completely blind to
the products that exist other than them
anybody else with you know two hundred
plus dollars to spend on a board is
buying an Intel chip right now sorry and
the motherboard manufacturers they don't
just they don't just know this from like
a they have an ounce of sense and can
read a benchmark chart they know this
from a they are seeing actual real sales
numbers as AMD's line up gets more and
more and more irrelevant at this point
in time if I was building a new system I
would be very heavily looking at AMD
which isn't something that I've been
able to say for a very long time and
seeing this kind of variety in the
products that are available seeing
someone like asus go okay sure yeah
we've got the confidence to put the R&amp;amp;D
behind what will probably be a three
hundred to four hundred dollar board us
to put the Rd behind it because we know
that we're going to get enough of even
this kind of high-end product moved off
the shelf that we're going to recoup
that cost and maybe even make some money
to see that
really confidence-inspiring I am I am
just stoked yeah I don't really know I
don't really know what else to say about
that I don't necessarily have the same
confidence in Vega you're going to have
to wait for you're gonna have to wait
for the video to see the full kind of
rent but frontier Edition is like far
more of a piece of garbage then other
reviews necessarily indicated so our our
review of it is basically like this is
this is an early access game like this
is this is paying more for like access
to the select DLC so that you can have
the buggy gaming experience and then not
even get the like expansion pack that
you then have to go and buy anyway
that's when they actually fix it like
it's a bad product I'm really excited
for the video yeah it's it's going to be
one of those ones where like the vast
majority of the people who watch it are
going to be sensible people who can look
at the comment section where there's
very whole and so there's going to be so
I'm talking thumbs-up thumbs-down okay
yeah so there's going to be the vast
majority of like sensible people who can
look at at facts objectively you can
look at benchmarks objectively and who
don't leave a comment because they just
aren't that invested in it and then
there's going to be everybody else who
engages with this video and it's like
hmm and that exactly what my likes are
in the other side of the pool because
you're talking about people that would
dislike something because you dislike
something that is from a and B even from
the other side of the pool we were just
talking about how cool this stuff is
okay can so you don't screen but online
is the screen right now you hang any
stuff and someone in the chat into a
chat I saw just scroll through all caps
everything
AMD No
no no further information Acosta just
mah there's my opinion I don't think
that's cool cuz I'm D I didn't ask
yeah thanks I guess yeah I don't know
there's there's people on each side
there's there's Intel fanboys there's
AMD fanboy fanboys and everybody hates
each other yeah everybody now the whole
chat is just AMD know and you know
alright thank you thank you everyone
that's wonderful appreciated all right
uh next in the news so this was
originally pulled by Johnny corporal
pack on the forum and our original
article here is it from cbc.ca the dark
webs largest illegal marketplace founded
by a Canadian name plan I didn't know
that shut down by the US alright so
let's get into this one a little bit so
the US Justice Department has officially
shut down the dark web marketplace alpha
Bay a site ten times as large as Silk
Road accused of allowing hundreds of
thousands of people to buy and sell
drugs firearms computer hacking tools
and other illicit goods because remember
there's lots of illegal stuff besides
like drugs and guns yeah I like for
example um like a cell phone signal
jammer it would be the kind of thing
that totally definitely exists super
definitely is everywhere but is illegal
to own or operate in pretty much any
developed nation I was making yeah
definitely Canada yeah um so so that's
the kind of thing that could end up on a
site like this the operation included
the arrests of suspected alphabet
founder Alexander Quezon Kazuki's
cousins because it's hidden a 25 year
old Canadian citizen arrested on behalf
of the United States in Thailand he
apparently took his own life
a week later while in Thai custom
and he faced charges relating to
narcotics distribution identity theft
money laundering and related crime
basically he was screwed and he was sure
that he was not getting out yes yeah the
usernames and passwords of thousands of
buyers and sellers of illicit
commodities have been identified and are
subject to follow-up investigation by
Europol it's and partner agencies
it's just usernames and passwords like
ID you know what remember this is the
world where people give televangelists
money to buy private jets you know about
that's right no yeah this has happened
oh yes more than once
where they literally got up there and
they're like to spread the word of God I
need a private jet time so send me
anything you can spare I'm like that's a
thing that's a real thing
they ride around in private jets that
they literally said they were going to
buy with donation money tax-free so
don't assert estimate people's ability
to use the same username and password
that they use on frickin Facebook for a
dark web marketplace where you buy like
drugs
yes general hopefully we get a follow-up
article on this with like how many
people got screwed i super-duper hold
entertaining
I need to start the Church of - okay
twitch chats like need Church of - I
need a lot of thread word bro I think I
would be in every word of CPU I think I
would be an excellent televangelist
probably I I could I could have so much
fun with that stick okay luckily would
follow would follow best Church love it
okay we've got we've got ourselves at
least at least like 30 followers right
now
which which in some states is probably
enough for tax-exempt status so here we
are doing this awesome oh man other
people want Church of Liu and you can
have your own church I mean I know we
should make a I can be one of your
things a denomination yeah like it's
okay so it's actually like the Church of
Tech yes so you could be like Lucas yeah
like like a you know like line of
solecism yes oh crap
perfect yeah and then like we can
pretend to like fight to make it more
interesting just like those guys that
are really popular on YouTube right now
that can trim the name of where they
like pretend little quarrels but then
behind the scenes were like just finding
ways to gather more money apparently
general John Oliver's done it I've heard
of this so there you go okay all right
what hasn't John Oliver done and they
like had to pull it down because it was
like working - well yeah but I think
everyone knew it was a joke okay good
people just wanted to contribute I
thought ironically working yes okay I'm
pretty sure that's what was going but I
mean that's still a that's still a
pretty good scan oh yeah like haha
let's show all the lol give me money
hahaha Oh terrible yeah alright no no
the way we make money is much much more
aboveboard than all of that because we
tell you right now actually I guess they
are just saying send me money so I can
have a jet okay so watch this ad spot so
that I can buy a phone on a jet
something not a jet but you can hire
more people yeah fresh books my thing

being like flippin gonna be awesome I
almost wish I like what hosting a booth
is going to be super fun and a new
experience for a convention for me but
like as someone who really enjoys
conventions and having good conventions
that I go to be less and less about tech
seeing this is really exciting
well it's VR dude you could just leave
people in VR and like go away that's
fair I could probably do that there's a
case sauce the Corsair key swapping
company yes and legs are like
leaderboards prizes yeah you wouldn't
believe how much like some companies we
reached out we were like hey could we
get some prizes and they were like sure
here's like boxes of like lanyards and
cool crap
some companies we reached out and we
were like hey could we get some swag and
they were like boom here's a Titan XP
room here's multiple gtx ten 70s boom
here's limited edition geforce USB
drives or boom here's literally like I
think a su cent like 300 or 400 t-shirts
what so there's going to be like an asus
t-shirt for like Alma holding every
other person who's there this thing is
going to be swag central giveaway
central okay this is the thing at like
packs and stuff all the really cool
giveaways used to be from the PC guys it
was rarely the gaming companies they
might give it a shirt yeah with the PC
hardware groups like now MSI used to
have sick giveaway now remember that
NZXT steps particularly Nvidia used to
like enjoyment are giving away like
shields like candy one year they would
go into BYOC what might one of my
favorite experiences that I ever
a datapacks was an nvidia giveaway in
happy Wow c-section I didn't get to
participate in it because we weren't in
byc yet we're in like the free play area
but we could hear it because it's right
beside it the first thing that did was
the first person to rip an AMD card out
of their system and hand it to me gets a
brand new top-of-the-line Nvidia card I
don't know what card it was I think it
was like a 580 or something but any AMD
card every system you get a 580 the next
one was like some weird competition you
got another 580 and there's more by the
way because not to be upstaged by Nvidia
let me tell you AMD is going to have
some stuff there yeah some stuff that I
actually can't even talk about yeah and
some of the stuff that I can't even talk
about might be getting given away yeah
so like there's gonna be a thing there's
going to be crazy we're going to have
never-before-seen - media group videos
that will never be seen whether they
were rejected by the brand or that we
couldn't get music licensing figured out
for them there's going to be a channel
super fun that will probably never
satellite video
double of that might never otherwise
he's a light of day there's going to be
nothing else we got I don't know a lot
of this 15k gaming is going to be there
the arcade machines gotta be there cool
oil pcs going to be there the one and
only and we're doing a silent auction
for VC Children's Hospital where I went
around and I found a bunch of relics of
lioness tech tips so there's a refurb
drive from the original Wanek server oh
it's pretty so it's like that kind of
stuff animation and I was going to have
I was going to have Colton Steph check
with you but I actually wanted to see if
you want to do the fallout bomb oh for
Sick Kids I might end up just winning it
you would just buy it's even mine like
that's technically that's why I want
that's why I told them we had to ask you
about it you want to do it we can do it
here
I'll probably just add with it I told
them I told them that they couldn't do
the scrapyard worse PC that would
probably hurt me about that I told them
that was the limit but they were like
they wanted like a build of some sort so
they could do the bone so okay if not
the bomb then we'll have the Plasti Dip
PC
okay so there will be I'll build there
that you'll be able to end the bottom is
just an empty case by the way but there
will be like a case that was featured no
all the wiring so like you could it has
all the like front IO that would be in a
normal case so you could build a system
in there recreating the thermal setup
that I had so that it wouldn't crash at
like any load is going to be difficulty
play yeah that actually took like a long
time
so anyway LT X is going to be sick and
it's not true next weekend the 29th and
if you somehow are like I'm teched-out
right now or I don't want to see video
games or something for a while there's
like jousting sumo wrestling bungee run
awesome Egon a lay offs rock leading
real life there's and we've seen we had
on stage unboxings to exclusive on stage
on but I think our biggest issue is
going to be that it's not like two days
yeah there's so much substance well we
were worried there wasn't going to be
like anything to do though I know
there's likely careful with it like
ample amount well you know what we'll
probably do is if it's if everyone who
comes has a blast and like tell three
friends and we have like you know
thousands of people there next year then
we'll probably have to run it over a
couple days little stuff to see how it
goes yeah ticket sales sucked like we
could have expanded it to a second day
we checked with the Convention Center
but like ticket sales were kind of lame
so we were like not lame enough that
we're like yeah we have to cancel this
but like one issue is that it didn't
Canada I know I received a lot of
messages I never be a problem
I know I know but like what are we
supposed to do like cart 16k gaming to
like LA well Seattle still yeah I know
still I know like alright other sponsors

uh that's here oh it's not open yet yeah
okay hello my sweet I'll try it a little
later alright let's move on to let's
move on to another topic here we can
move on to the topic of hiring pool
playing people um we can move on to the
topic of the knock - of things
interesting have you not seen that no I
kind of okay
I was just supposed to buy Ventus on the
forum and apparently so this is from our
slash build a PC posted by a Ken doll
visible manufacturing differences
between Noctua fans made in Taiwan
versus China yeah I'm really wondering
what your opinion is on this actually I
think the twitch chat probably is - Wow
yeah the fan blades on the Taiwan fans
are noticeably smoother and more rounded
the slow acceleration channels on the
blades of the Taiwan fans are more
defined the inner surface micro
structures of the made in Taiwan's one
have a distinct water drop shape whereas
the made in China are just a shallow
triangular cutout I communicate I was
going to say do you sound like
counterfeits even I communicated these
differences with Noctua and they claimed
that the differences are within their
manufacturing tolerances and do not
affect performance but knocked what is
known for its reputation of the highest
attention to detail and I'm sure that's
also really good but the Nakhla
engineers designed these tiny details to
exacting specifications for some reason
is basically what the reddit post
continues to say
apparently now haven't heard them but
the made in China fans apparently have a
noticeably louder drone when spinning at
the same rpm rpm as the other fans now
gamers Nexus is going to be apparently
doing tests and going to be making a
video on it which is cool yeah or
they're laughing back check them out
over at gamers Nexus comm or they've got
a YouTube channel as well they'll
probably make a video on this one yeah
good guys over there yep they've been
they've actually done a lot of good
content around this type of stuff yeah I
enjoy them there's more their wheelhouse
than ours anyway but I'll definitely be
paying close attention and we can talk
about it on LAN show in the future to
how this works out and I'm definitely
firing up an email over to my contacts
over there like what the heck is going
on because like I'll tell you guys
something so this is sort of this is
sort of very sort of behind-the-scenes
sort of in my brain how things work one
of the business ideas that I would love
to explore in the future as much as I
love selling digital influence which is
a great business by the way because you
don't have any manufacturing cost well
you don't have to carry any inventory
well I mean okay yes you have to you
know people like that you know equipment
and all that kind of thing but but but
these are one-time costs
yeah not but not per item you don't have
to rd a new frickin you know nuttin
screw or whatever every time you get
like it Brandi just has to change the
lighting setup it's somewhat more finite
so I like the business of selling
digital influence but one of the
companies that I would want to found
when I have some more time and when I am
able to do it would be a manufacturer of
a physical product and a lot of the
philosophy that I'm developing for this
company is actually borrowed from my
perception of not to us yeah because I
thought of Noctua that they were like
like the founders were somehow deeply
involved in aerodynamics research or
something at some university over there
don't remember where I heard it but like
someone told me that someone told them
that that was the background but that
wasn't what happened at all
Roz calm the pairing company if not to
us was just like a small-time european
computer hardware distributor like you
know like like like a you know frozen
cpu before i went down so so they were
just a distributor of other people's
parts and then frozen is actually a
perfect example of a company that also
developed their own products at one
point and then completely went off the
deep end so when I found that out I kind
of went well how is it that your fans
are the best and they kind of went well
I when do you have like brilliant
amazing engineers and they were like
well yeah we have like you know good
engineers but but they're not you know
leading researchers in the field of you
know fluid dynamics or anything yeah
they're they're engineers and I was like
well then why are yours better than
someone else's and they're like because
we don't really sit until it's right
because of attention to detail because
we care and this doesn't sound like
caring or attention to detail no it
doesn't so this is kind of like this is
kind of shaking because this is kind of
shaking the foundation of a business
that I you know haven't invested $1 into
yet like I'm not even close to starting
it but one that I that I do want to
start at some point and that I that I
had planned to build around basically
the knock to a philosophy charge as much
as it takes to make a profit on the best
product you could build so it's going to
be expensive but make sure that what you
build is the best that was that was the
idea and I'm I'm sort of you know I
don't want to get ahead of myself
because if there's anything that I'm a
fanboy of it's not to a fans yes so I'm
not going to freak out yet I also want
to point out that the link that I posted
in the chat for the reddit conversation
does have a video doing the sound
comparison it does have a lot of
frame color difference pictures it has a
lot of comparison images for a ton of
different things this guy has done a lot
of work
he's obviously affected he might be as
much of an ox with an boys you are huh
well let's um so see how that goes
I'm interested yeah if this is if this
is true what is what is the name of that
other brand they're black and white fans
Alan Joyce blocker noise blocker if this
is true will you actually try a noise
blocker fan Wow because this is okay
this has been it like I don't bring it
up much because we talked about it a lot
a long time ago and this conversation is
just concluded like there's nothing else
to really talk about it was just like no
I found a fan I really like it this is
this is perfect I'm going to use it for
ever going to use it forever and that's
fine it's a fan you can one put your
specification and it's not so much that
I refuse to use noise blocker or
something like that it's just like if
noise Locker was better than an NFS 12
then it like it really wasn't by much
and a big part of what I trusted about
Noctua and Trust about Noctua
trust it I don't know it's like I don't
know what I don't know what anything is
anymore a big part of what I'm doing a
big part of what I have trusted about
Noctua
is inside information that I have from
being the product manager on their line
in seeing real world RMA rates they
don't die or like anything can die but
they generally don't worry
uncommon very reliable I'm just saying
right now but a noisy lockers be
different maybe that could be different
to noise blocker black silent Pro fans
look really slick
I'm just saying all right well speaking
of companies that are capable of both
delighting and disappointing me our next
bit of news posted by HK 0-5 on the
forum is originally from video cards
calm and is a rumor about Intel so Intel
is allegedly working on multiple hex
core coffee Lakes CPU so coffee Lake for
those of you not familiar will be the
replacement two KB Lake and that will be
a mainstream processor so this tells us
a couple things this tells us either
that Intel of its own accord had been
finally intending to deliver a six core
mainstream processor anyway before AMD
drops Rison yeah or that Intel became
aware that Rison was going to be pretty
good through corporate espionage far
before the rest of the industry knew
about it and started working on this
more just already had it and just
decided not to do anything with it I
don't think so because if they'd already
had it they could have done it with KB
Lake right
whereas Coffee Lake is going to be a new
platform so it's going to be a new
chipset I think if they had been if they
had known about it two years ago we have
it in KB Lake yeah whereas if they knew
about it like a year and a half ago then
either they decided on their own it's
time or or they weren't willing to throw
a fast one at motherboard manufactures
again so hard with mainstream processors
it might be easier to throw a fast one
at them with motherboards that they
won't have to make nearly as many of
this could be very disruptive to Rison
yeah but I think Rison has AMD as a
whole probably at this point gotten a
lot more customers just because people
are more interested in them because
they're tired of some of the crap from
the other side I can see that and I feel
like a lot of the communication that's
currently going around AMD isn't going
to go away even if Intel release is a
good
officer because there are certain like
business practice things that people
didn't like that's true
now you can I think those communication
lines might keep them going and I mean a
lot of people will buy based on a
particular brand loyalty
yeah or you'll see a post on PCMR that's
like oh these are great and go by and if
either product is like good yeah then
there's really nothing wrong with that
people are going to fight super hard if
they're both good products like you know
you go back do you go back far enough to
when you know AMD and NVIDIA were pretty
comparable so like you know we could
look at the like the X X 800 era or
something like that like an X 800 Pro
was like pretty frickin similar to a
7800 GT or whatever the contemporary one
was I can't I can't remember exactly was
it 60 6800 6100 GT I don't I remember
anyway they were pretty darn close it
came down to whether you liked catalyst
control center or was it so called
detonator at the time I don't remember
whatever ideas driver was called thank
you to everyone and twitch that that is
currently going in tell no I love that
that Mimi's going alright anyway here's
kind of the summary of these rumors Kay
version will have a 3.7 gigahertz base
with hyper-threading enabled so that's
12 threads and the 9k running at 3.2 TDP
of 95 watts which should be quite doable
and then there will apparently and
that'll be the flagship so that'll be
the 8700 the 8700 series then the there
will be a 6 core i5 as well Wow oh
that's interesting
with that being the slowest six core
desktop the 8600 k 3.6 gigahertz and
then 95 watt TDP no hyper-threading wait
no the slowest six core will be a core
i5 8400 Wow so that could be like that
could be like a hundred and seventy
dollars hundred seventy five dollar
price point that one then the article is
saying looks like a direct respond
- AMD's rise inside Intel will also
apparently introduce an actual mobile
CPU with six cores with much lower clock
speeds and a 45 watt TDP so you'd expect
to find that in something like an Acer
predator 21 X refresh or something along
those lines
Wow it's not okay so sorry I just got to
give an update on the the nose polish at
one more thing it's apparently unclear
at this time whether these will require
new motherboards though I would have
thought they would yeah so don't quote
me on that one okay so go ahead well it
has divulged it started with AMD no and
then it transferred into Intel no with
this article which is funny and now it's
just turned into like anything no
perfect it's just it's it's chaos chaos
and switch Chet the bots banning
everybody it's it's hell out there man
yeah you gotta fight to survive all
right so we can probably skim I there
really isn't much going on here all that
said Nintendo applied for a patent for
its Nintendo 64 controller they
reapplied for a Nintendo 64 controller
patents so there's probably a Nintendo
64 Classic coming after this Ness
classic but who knows and it's not
coming for a long time and it's pretty
expected that that would happen anyways
so yeah cool yeah can you like how much
are Ness classics at this point very
expensive apparently people have found
some that got restocked hmm so there's a
little bit of rumor going around that
they might start actually manufacturing
all them instead of just having them as
one year oh so stupid yeah like this and
there's a lot of money there's a lot of
people that want to have the set like
Nintendo why do you hate money yeah I
just I don't even they have so much I
really love it when people like man that
was a stupid decision from Nintendo
they're gonna die as a company I'm like
no they're not Nintendo can survive for
like ever while making terrible
decisions
they have so much money it doesn't even
matter though they'll like fail
repeatedly and then just release another
like we or switch the switch is doing
incredibly well it's like oh the Wii U
didn't matter and no one knew it existed
that's fine
Nintendo will just survive and then just
smash the gaming world again with some
other new console doesn't matter they
like a way more intense version of the
Microsoft like every second OS thing um
this is kind of funny yeah
posted by Dyson on the forum the
original article here is from the BBC a
Chinese mole introduces husband storage
pods for shopping wives husbands can
play old-school games like Tekken 3 in
the pods I'm also going to China I want
this in the North American malls okay no
not necessarily apparently there's no
ventilation or air conditioning some
guys sat in and played for five minutes
and was just drenched in sweat okay so
maybe better ones that may be better one
so these are glass pods where women can
leave their partners while they shop
inside each individual pod is a chair
monitor computer and game pad and men
can sit and play retro 1990s games if it
is currently free yeah but in the future
users will have to pay to scan a QR code
pay and scan a QR code to use the
service they should just make it so that
you like pair up with the person that
you're shopping with and as they make
purchases it like gives you more time
you know what I mean so you don't
actually have to pay for it so tied in
with like some someone in your group is
spending money at the mall so you get to
stay in your little pod and they should
make it so you can like order food to it
and everything it'd be awesome I just
will also want to bring up that the
binos in chat switched to money no
Nintendo no and profit no Oh excellent
good job thank you for the update
keep going I love to see it the original
article here is from all knowledge
YouTube launches its counterterrorism
experiment for would-be Isis recruits
and basically what's going on here is
that
now when a potential Isis recruit
searches for known extremist content on
YouTube using a predefined set of
keywords they will instead be redirected
to videos that deconstruct and confront
the terrorist group so uh no I said no I
didn't wait to entertain her from this
hi I am completely ok with this so these
are curated YouTube videos debunking
Isis recruiting themes this open
methodology was developed from
interviews with Isis defectors respects
users privacy and can be deployed to
tackle other types of violent recruiting
discourses online so that's where this
gets kind of dicey I chose Google where
is the line yeah
so the recruit the redirect method began
with an 8 week pilot program enlisting
320,000 viewers that explored some key
insights around the kind of things that
potential Isis recruits search for to be
fair though this YouTube is not a
government website mm-hmm they can
suggest and they've a suggest an
algorithm they can suggest whatever they
want to you mhm this is why stuff like
floatplane makes sense except maybe not
for that type of coming out but like if
you if you want to specifically see one
thing that you're searching for going to
one website that has like a crazy
machine learning algorithm that's trying
to just give you what it wants to give
you is not necessarily the greatest way
to go so effective deterrents apparently
include documentary videos with a good
idea citizen journalism that ways
interesting videos that feature
religious debate and videos from Isis
defectors I wouldn't have thought
necessarily the third one the religious
debate one is weird because I could just
see that fueling someone even more or
maybe not I think maybe these people are
obviously ok ok I'm going to be careful
here but I would think that someone who
manages to be converted to an extremist
is probably pretty um how you say the
force would work on them no they're
probably pretty suggestible yes right ok
we go yeah it wouldn't take an obi-wan
because he has a special gift for just
basically anyone basically anyone so if
you just throw a debate in front of them
maybe that qui-gon who never
successfully does it in the movies would
be able to manage it too many Star Wars
means sorry um yeah that's interesting I
don't like I can't be upset about it
this particular instance I have no issue
with at all seeing where this goes could
be a big problem
again I personally think private company
it's not a government agency they can
kind of do whatever they want I might
not like it but that would just incite
people to use other platforms more if
they have used it so just do that again
it's a it's a private company you have
the freedom to use other things if you
would like to hopefully they don't take
it much further than this trying to stop
people from becoming terrorists heck
yeah
super down with that I wanna stop people
from using edge browser man that's the
land show for today thank you guys for
tuning in we will see you again next
week same time we leave yet oh there's
two things that we still have to do what
we have to do one I'm recruiting for
floatplane if you want to be a developer
and you want to come join us there is I
think you there's a video on our
Facebook page and on our Twitter right
now and on floatplane if you want to see
it unfortunately I am looking
specifically for Canadians or Americans
who have a degree in a highly related
field like computer science or like
software engineering it has to be very
directly related that is because of like
immigration law and all this kind of
stuff we have already picked up two guys
that don't fit within that realm and
it's been a problem trying to get them
into Canada and trying to keep them
employed because Canada doesn't want you
to have people who are employed who
don't live in Canada when you don't have
an office outside of Canada buh buh buh
buh buh buh flex so we're trying to make
this process a little bit easier and
we're just going for Canadians or
Americans with a full bachelor's degree
that's nice too oh yeah telling you
really excited it's good they're new
flavors very good so yeah if you are
interested you want to apply back and
front end check out those videos that
goes into more specifics there about
even what the heck's floatplane is
employment now what you'd be doing is
that people are doing now employees know
that about how edge no oh god I love
that I don't know why I love that so
much but I do also we should go over
what's on float plane right now
mmm right we can't miss two weeks in a
row that would be um dang it I'm not
finding what a nerd know what whatever
you've got I've been watching for like
I'm talking about the the archive if
anyone actually made it this far into
the video what's another like thirty
seconds sir shoot that's not that what's
wrong well I'm even doing I'm busy
enjoying this jerky hey someone said
slow plane yes I'll take that mean break
sorry I have to sign in to what to sign
into my password manager in order to
sign it off Oh everything is awful all
in the name of security is alright
pretty much yep yep that's security
I'm just tired of having accounts
compromised yeah that was no fun no that
wasn't a lot of fun 200k no I will not
be paying you 200 K and when you're in
her style in response to your answer no
I will not be doing it either yeah all
right look if that works boom we're in
all right sounds like 200k yes
so what do we got
Casino technology is that's actually a
pretty good effort it's been a little
bit comments on that I've been
interesting because there's some people
feel quite strongly about casinos I
didn't really think that was going to be
a thing like gambling addiction and all
this kind of stuff ya know what I have
to do with us though I don't know it's
been an interesting comment section
interesting um doesn't necessarily been
pointed at us it should been interesting
mezzanine update 11 is now here yeah
whoo look at that especially long I'm
gonna long hear five truly unusual
graphics cards they truly are unusual I
got to give us credit for titling this
one very correctly that's a fan oh yeah
that's unusual at the bank yes yep the
world's most amazing desk PC 16k gaming
build vlog dun dun da I I think you
could have had an even click your title
for that um I don't think the
interesting part there's the desk piece
I think I'm honored I think the thumb
well that that's the subject of this one
is actually building the desk PC and
getting everything mounted so there's
this is part one of two AH the other one
focuses more on the moment hearts you
might even do better part two is the one
that I expect to like beat a K gaming
yeah okay okay cool um
another 16 K yes another rant about red
digital cinema is coming there you go to
youtube or you can watch on floatplane
now there you go
$7,000 card that's absolutely a pretty
cool video I watch their DJI spark
videos up Oh what else you got
I think I think that might be it oh this
project or therus that thing is insane
the this is actually this was half of
the joke when I did that stupid thing
with SLI breasts yes red no you've
started a monster I love it it's so it's
like 80% of the twitch chat right now so
this was part of the joke when I said
world smallest SLI with those stupid USB
drives is that we actually will have the
world's smallest on the channel very
soon
that's awesome with 1080 T eyes this
time like for real alright so thank you
for tuning in to the ranch so we will
see you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel oh wait
note before you go right here's the link
to where you can join floatplane club
you should join so you can go binge
watch all that stuff yeah
the 16k monitors set up desk PC thing is
pretty insane it's like super dope it's
insane everybody stop spamming so I can
post my damn weird about it yes stop no
well it's all over yes
Terrebonne should make a shirt shirt
yeah
not shirt no no ha ha ha ha ha
you can vote you can vote for which side
you like more oh my goodness arrabal so
good check out our sponsors yes ha ha
be happy that the show is over now No</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
