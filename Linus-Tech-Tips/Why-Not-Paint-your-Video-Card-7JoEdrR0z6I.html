that I did on the creation of my DIY
paint booth a little while ago but what
I hope and based on the reaction on
social media this seems to be the case
is that you will at least like my first
creation that has come out of it welcome
to my guide on how to paint your
graphics card
the gtx 980ti VR edition from EVGA
provides an industry-leading graphics
experience as well as a five and a
quarter inch bay with easy access inputs
for your VR device learn more at the
link in the video description after
putting a couple of finishing touches on
the DIY paint booth including finally
attaching the fan and putting a shroud
of tuck tape around it as well as taping
the drop sheet on the floor to the
plastic walls around the outside it was
time to disassemble the card now the
objective here is to take it down as far
as we can to its bare components because
the objective is not to just coat the
entire thing in a in a layer of orange
paint I'm actually only looking to
change the blasted aluminum parts so I
end up with this sick LTT black and
orange color scheme now this procedure
this is kind of cool can be used for
painting like what I'm doing but it can
also be used for cleaning out the cooler
of many reference Nvidia graphics cards
from the last couple of generations so
make sure you're paying close attention
if your GPU starts overheating to begin
with you'll need a number 1 phillips a
number 0 0 phillips a size 1 and a 1/2 x
and a size 2 hex as well as a little bit
of patience begin by removing the
reference cooler from the PCB all the
screws on the back and the screws along
with the hex shaped DVI retention
sockets need to come out pull the
graphics card itself away from the
cooler we were lucky and all our thermal
pads stayed in one place making
reassembly easy later but if they don't
make sure you put them back somewhere
safe then remove the two power
connectors for the fan and the
illuminated GeForce logo and put the
video card somewhere safe we won't need
it until it's time to put the entire
assembly back together now we remove the
screws for the top and bottom aluminum
fascia pieces one of them has a little
bit of adhesive so be careful not to
bend it while you're pulling it off the
cooler from here it's basically an
exercise in find the screws and remove
them so we took out the screws holding
in the plexi
window and the one securing the black
shroud that sits around the fan giving
us a great look at the dark
nickel-plated vapor chamber heatsink
that Nvidia uses on the 980ti
then we worked our way towards the back
of the card all the black pieces will be
put aside since we'll be keeping the
factory finish and the aluminum pieces
the last of which we get access to by
removing these four screws that were
exposed are taken into the paint booth
for preparation the one screw that we
didn't remove was the one holding in the
cooling fan on the underside of the Uni
sink that has all these thermal pads on
it there is no need to take this off and
I don't recommend painting a fan as it
can ruin its balance making it louder
and potentially less reliable step 1
prep solvent I mean we aren't working
with car parts that have been driving
around on muddy roads so it's probably
not necessary but it can't hurt step two
is sanding so we actually took a wet
sand run at it with 600 grit I'm not
sure if the anodized finish on these
components would have interfered with
paint adhesion but I'm going to play it
better safe than sorry and remove it
anyway then we wet sand with 1000 grit
to ensure that our finished surface will
be sex errific by the end dry the parts
off and it's time to set about priming
here we went with three light to medium
coats waiting about ten minutes in
between them with the experience I
gained from this project I would have
gone back and done this with white
primer but gray was what I had at the
time and it ended up working out not too
bad now our ambient temperature was a
little on the low side so I actually
ended up having to leave the primed
parts in the office overnight to cure
before I could sand off the dust and
imperfections with a very light 600 grit
wet sand dry them again and then move on
to my favorite part applying the base
coat for the color I chose a Lamborghini
Orange that looked dazzling on the web
and actually did not disappoint in
person the first coat actually very
mediocre it had kind of a yellow cast to
it but
as I applied more coats the vibrancy of
the color really started to come through
I ended up using five coats then once we
reach the clear coating stage I actually
made a very unexpected decision normally
I would want to apply my four to five
clear coats and then wait 24 hours and
use rubbing compound to bring the clear
coat to that glassy smooth finish but
with the wrinkled powder coat finish of
the black components I find I actually
prefer the subtle orange peel texture of
the parts without any further finishing
and I understand normally this is a very
undesirable effect in a paint job and
considered the mark of a slapdash job
but you know what
Yolo I like it and I am sticking with it
which leaves reassembly as the only
remaining step basically do everything
you just did while you took the card
apart but in reverse order and you
should have yourself an absolutely sick
looking reference graphics card now for
those of you concerned about warranty on
a mod like this that is a very valid
concern but I was pleasantly surprised
to find that on this EVGA card anyway I
actually didn't need to remove any
warranty stickers to complete the
project
and so if you were to use Plasti Dip
instead of car paint you could easily
take it back apart and peel off the
plastic reassemble it and send it back
for repairs no big deal so happy
painting then guys thanks to this guide
you can either clean your in video
reference video card or save yourself
the small loan of about $4,000 that it
would take to get your hands on a
multicolored reference card out of the
box
and we're back with another drop this
time it's the one plus to mass drop is
the platform that allows the community
to say hey we want to deal on like you
know this knife for that keyboard or
this light cool piece of hiking
equipment or in this case this cool
smartphone can you go to the
manufacturer and say hey if we can sell
a whole bunch of these then can you give
us a lower price and that is exactly
what happened so the one plus two is a
five and a half inch 1080p smartphone
for Snapdragon 810 processor and Adreno
430 GPU runs android 5.1 and has a USB
type-c port for charging and it's
available for a limited time only on
mass drop so all you got to do is head
over to draw ups /lt t1 plus don't worry
if that's complicated it's linked in the
video description and check it out and
while you're over there they've got lots
of other cool stuff too so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked yeah
well you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or even consider supporting us
directly by using our affiliate code to
shop it down is on instructions up there
by buying a cool shirt like this one or
with a direct monthly contribution
through our community forum which by the
way you don't have to contribute to you
can just go over there and chat tech and
get answers to your questions it's
pretty freaking awesome now that you're
done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering how G what should I
watch next well how about this video
right here I guarantee you it's awesome
and if it's not then you know lmg takes
no responsibility for any guarantees
made by their hosts in both days
awesomeness of aforementioned videos and
Etsy later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
