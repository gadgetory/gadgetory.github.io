granddaddy of all Corsair power supplies
this is part of their new ax series this
is the Corsair ax 1200 that means this
is a one point two kilo watt power
supply and in addition to coming with a
seven year warranty it is 80 plus gold
that means it's near 90 percent
efficiency in almost all scenarios Ted
has okay mission-critical stability
unprecedented flexibility with a fully
modular design and industry-leading
protection okay so yeah we've covered
that already with the second year
warranty on the back you can see Corsair
gives you some informations about what
kind of connectors come with it so you
have one 20 or 24 pin two EPs four pin
and eight pin compatible so they're both
four plus four is I believe six PCIe six
pins and eight pin compatible so six
plus two is you can see they look like
that 16 SATA Wow 12 4-pin molex and then
two floppy adapters now you can't
necessarily plug in all of those at the
same time it is a fully modular power
supply so it is designed for you to only
use the cables you require here we can
see noise so in actually the fan that's
hidden okay the fan doesn't even begin
to ramp up from its nominal speed until
you hit a 600 watt load hilarious and
then it doesn't actually go above about
25 decibels until you hit 850 watts and
after that it starts to I it starts to
really ramp up and then here's our
efficiency so at around 600 watts that's
where you see your highest efficiency
over 90% even with a hundred and 20 volt
wall power incredible so obviously as
you I may or may not expect this is
quite an expensive pair of arms in
there's the problem this is quite an
expensive power supply so I'm going to
go ahead and unbox it for your viewing
pleasure
uses the same packaging as the 750 and
the 50 watt version so that means that
you've got an outer sleeve here that
just comes right off so I'm going to go
ahead and to get rid of a step back
which doesn't help if I keep carrying
the product with me so we just kind of
picking that up from the top there we go
and then we have a plain brown box
inside oh man that's heavy oh that is
one heavy power supply it's like heavy
man all right oh there's a quantity of
one in here here is the common manual
for the 750 850 and 1200 here is a very
beefy power cord next we have the baggie
of modular cable which is very very full
as you can see if this we'll have a
closer look at that after although we
already covered which connectors there
are so we're not going to look quite as
closely at it as we did with the 6r with
the 850 watt rather for black screws for
attaching the power supply to the case
one Corsair case badge some cable ties
and as you can see if you go further
into the Box you will find one cat
excuse me sir can see hi say hi don't
want to see how you look up here oh okay
get down then alright next we find the
power supply itself it is wrapped in a
gym bag with drawstring okay hey there's
something probably a part number for the
gym bag if you ever need to replace it
and then we're gonna dump out the power
supply itself and my dump out I mean
remove carefully because this is the oh
boy that's bad don't you on that please
go on go on thank you
sorry I saw them out of the corner of my
eye there Wow can't have that going on
not on my watch
all right there we go so the sense this
is pretty much the beating heart of your
system you want to be very very gentle
with it treat it like you would
something that protects your entire
computer and powers it treated exactly
like that all right so here we find a
legend on the back of the power supply
so here we go 24 pin ATX plugs in there
here we have peripheral and SATA here we
have six plus two PCIe and four plus
four CPU so you can see you can do 2 4 +
horse so that means that you can run
boards like classified boards rampage 3
extremes boards that require 2 8 pins
they don't require them but they can use
them and then you can run up to 3 dual
plug graphics cards whether they need a
6 pin or whether they need an 8 pin so
let's have a look at what we're provided
in terms of modular peripheral and SATA
cables so you can see the molex ones
include 4 connections per cable and then
there's probably a couple that have only
2 just in case you don't want to use 4
so there's another 4 here we have ok
here's one with 4 SATA here's one with
only 2 SATA aha so they give you lots of
options in terms of here's on the for
SATA here's one with 4 SATA here's one
with 4 molex and then here's one with 2
SATA so you got just a ton of options
here's the adapters I was talking about
molex to floppy and then the rest of the
ones in here are sleeved very nicely so
these are all of the 6 plus 2 pins as
well as the 4 plus 4 pins and the 24-pin
connector why don't you pull the 24 pin
it just have a look at that there you go
there's our 24 pin very again very nice
blacks leaving I really like the light
Corsair does their cables with the black
wires black connectors whacks leaving it
just black goes well with anything so
why not just make everything black okay
on the side you see course their
branding X 1200 there's a bit of a gold
theme and that goes along with the 80
plus of gold on the top
you're going to notice one of the most
remarkable things about this power
supply if i zoom in on the label and let
me see if I can not define here right
there 100 point four amps on a single 12
volt rail that is serious business that
is able of
Wow look at that capable of providing
one thousand two hundred and four point
eight watts on the 12 volt rail alone
I'm gonna let you take that in for a
little while yeah so now let's look at
the rest of the power supply that's more
coarse their branding on the other side
but what appears to be a think it's a
135 mm fan although I could be wrong
it could be 120 mil it's tough tie ball
these things when it's installed in a
power supply because power supplies are
not a standard size so you can't just
kind of go based on you know how far it
is from here you're gonna kind of
eyeball it up yeah jeez I'm pretty sure
that's a 135 mill at the back you will
find your kind of pretty much standard a
honeycomb back with on/off switch and a
plug in it's nice to see that the ax
1200 doesn't use that non-standard plug
but many the other high wattage ones do
I realize there's a reason that they use
it but I'm glad that Corsair did not see
fit to equip this with one of those and
that's pretty much it thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the Corsair
Professional Series gold ax 1200 Ã¼ber
awesome powerful fully modular efficient
and silent power supply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
