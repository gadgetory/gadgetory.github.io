unboxing anyway today we are unboxing
via soos o play and this is the world's
first Network media player that can play
back our MVP now being the sort of
person I am with the color skin that I
have I don't really understand the value
of that but my understanding is
according to what people tell me that is
the best format where you can download
Asian soap opera so that's really
important to a lot of people so let's
take this plastic cover off now this is
very similar in terms of the overall
functionality to something like the
popcorn hour or the Western Digital WD
TV now let's have a look at what we've
got her connect connectivity we've got
right and left analog audio we've got
just a composite video we have digital
audio then we've got an HDMI cable
that's the one that most people are
going to be using because this is for HD
content folks
then we've got LAN power and then on the
left side of the unit we've got a USB
connection we've actually got an eSATA
connection that's pretty awesome because
that means that you can just throw your
media files onto an external hard drive
and then you can play them back over
eSATA so there's the top of the unit and
then the bottom of it now let's see what
else we've got in here in terms of
accessories so it comes in like a nice
black packaging oh this is great it
comes with all kinds of stuff so here
we've got a composite video cable and
audio cable then we've got power this is
an AC power cord so that'll plug into
the back of I'm gonna find out yeah
there we go so there's an AC to DC power
adaptor so your whole power set-up is
gonna plug into here plug into the wall
and then plug into the back of the unit
like this and then we've got a fairly
robust looking remote actually I would
have expected to see something along the
lines of the wgtv
but we've actually got a fair amount of
functionality here so there's your menu
navigation here's where you're gonna
play pause stop all that kind of easy
stuff you got volume control and there's
a bunch of other stuff on here frankly I
haven't done a lot of research on this
things
we're just mostly doing an unboxing here
here's your Quick Start Guide it
actually only comes with a QuickStart
guide there's no full manual but it does
show you all of the different connectors
all the functionality for the remote
here so Oh a lot of that other stuff was
you can change the subtitle in the
language which is great for the target
audience because a lot of those are
going to be subtitled and that was
pretty punch in it shows you where to
plug it into and then it goes on to
another language so that is the asou so
play here is your users manual disk so I
was mistaken it does come with a user's
manual and then you've got some
batteries for the remote thanks for
checking out my video blog from the
assuit Oh play</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
