pretty cool product that sort of arrived
in the mail for NCIX use this is an ET
2,400 series all-in-one PC from a soos
and I'm actually going to open this up
and then we're gonna throw it over on
the test bench once I've got it all
opened up so we can find out what the
specs of this machine are because right
now all I know is the series I don't
know how much RAM it has I don't know
how big the hard drive is all of that
good stuff like what kind of CPUs
installed so I'm just gonna do what I do
and that is I'm just gonna break seals
and show you guys the product and then
you will go from there so I broke the
seal and now I'm showing you guys oh
here's a warranty card so they put that
somewhere where you'll definitely find
it there we go and why don't we find out
what kind of warranty we have on this
particular all-in-one PC from masseuse
well there you can fill that in there's
your serial number that's handy warranty
conditions 12 months oh okay no no for
example twelve months means 24 12 12
months okay oh here we go so as soos
will provide warranty service for any
more than three bright dots or five dark
dots so that is on the LCD so that's
bright pixels or dead pixels okay and
we've got some foam so give me a second
I'm just gonna unpack this and then
we'll go for me okay accessory-wise oh
it comes packed in a nice closed cell
phone so very very very durable shipping
material this is one of my favorites
personally let's see what we got for
accessories so first things first we got
this that appears to be an IR sensor
okay
plugs it in via USB good next we have
what appears to be a mouse yeah just
your average wired mount while not
average I mean it's quite small I have
small hands and this is a small mouse
so you look look at that I mean these
are my fingers look how short my fingers
are okay so there's that next we have a
power cord which is your standard
notebook style power part and then we
have a power brick now for this one I'm
going to whip up the iPhone yeah yeah
cameraman is trying to give me his
iPhone but I have an iPhone now too
smart guy
yeah okay fine we'll use your iPhone
okay so that is how big it is compared
to an iPhone okay
and that is how thick it is compared to
an iPhone this is a big old power brick
be happy that this is not for your
laptop because it weighs like sixty
pounds well no it doesn't weigh 60
pounds that's happy since this is a
desktop PC though it's not really that
big of a concern
well it's not a big concern at all next
we have some kind of a remote which if
you put this on demo in the store
someone will surely steal within a
matter of minutes not that I'm saying
that that's an invitation to spew it
because it's really inconvenient when
people do that by the way but it will
happen and for whatever reason it takes
three batteries three Triple A batteries
I mean who has three Triple A batteries
really I've never seen a media center
remote that takes three batteries or
triple-a batteries I'm a big fan of
double-a batteries because they're
common and cheap and I like things that
are cheap there we go okay so that's got
all your standard me do it lights up
look at that whole thing is illuminated
okay well one away yeah cause the button
okay okay that's nice that's nice that
maybe that's why it takes three
batteries maybe that's what the extra
batteries for how are the light okay
next we have a keyboard pretty
run-of-the-mill keyboard I would
probably recommend getting a different
keyboard and mouse if you're gonna use
this for any sort of extended period of
time throughout the day all right now
let's do this
the success lots of plastic this is the
all-in-one PC itself and we now get our
first hint as to what is the spec of
this machine because there are stickers
on the front and indicates to us some of
those specifications so first of all we
can see that it runs Windows 7 next we
can see that it has an Intel Core i5
processor which basically means that it
rocks ok we have NVIDIA GeForce 310 M
512 Meg graphics which basically means
that it is capable of playing like HD
videos back which the core i5 would
anyway it is Energy Star compliant it
comes with some kind of pre-installed
trial of office 2010 ok over here we
have whoo distortion free audio base
enhancement immersive surround sound so
they're calling this sonic master that
is for Crystal peer surround
reproduction it is fine-tuned for
original recording production and then
here there's a little bubble that has
like some waves like real sound which is
yellow and then before tuning which is
green clearly way off and then after
tuning which is very close to the yellow
so close to real sound excellent ok you
can actually see the sound bar here at
the bottom of the screen so it's quite
large actually look at that so the sound
bar goes all the way across the entire
bottom of the all-in-one PC up here at
the top we have a webcam okay we have a
webcam and then over here we have an
accurate multi-touch screen yeah I don't
know what that's for I will figure it I
don't Lading okay so it has an accurate
multi-touch screen HDMI in so you can
play HD content from your notebook or
other multimedia devices that's pretty
neat that's something that I often feel
is missing from notebooks or from
all-in-one PCs is the ability to plug
something else into it and use it as a
monitor should you so desire you can
easily upgrade the memory and it
supports their performance 15-percent
super hybrid engine basically means you
can turn the four
it's kind of like overclocking okay
let's look around at the back of the
all-in-one PC where we find some
ventilation so there's clearly an
aluminum heatsink here as well as one
over here on the other side I can't know
if you can see where I'm pointing yes
you can
all right and that's where we have
ventilation coming from here's our easy
memory upgrade panel and this is gonna
take the plastic off there very very
very shiny finish overall on this
all-in-one PC so if you're down with
shiny you are down with this all-in-one
PC very very shiny okay let's have a
look at what we've got on the side in
terms of inputs and outputs and all that
kind of stuff we have our DVD multi
recorder we have a power button volume
up menu and volume down I'm going to go
ahead and turn this around okay and then
on the other side we have two USB ports
headphones microphone and a multi card
reader here on the back under the easy
memory slot which I'm just gonna well is
that even the easy memory slot well how
the devil does this work
hold on a minute that doesn't seem very
easy at all
okay guys feel free to post comments and
let me know how oh I think I get it I
get it there's a screw here so you undo
this screw then you pull up this tab and
then you have access to the memory
because this seems too easy for a title
or a curious toddler to come along take
this off and like and like eat your
memory if there wasn't another metal
plate there so I get it now okay down
here we've got four more USB ports a
Kensington lock antenna VGA okay HDMI IN
Gigabit Ethernet as well as power in so
let's go plug this baby in and see what
it's all about alright so we're finally
booted up to the desktop it did take a
little while but it got itself all
initialized up and all that good stuff
so let's have a look at what comes
pre-installed on the assuit all-in-one
PC that we're looking at today so
there's the super hybrid engine so
that's our Oh
UAC is kicking in here we go super
hybrid engine is
okay we got some more UAC going on
something about easy update ah let's do
that later
cancel okay yeah oh nice okay super
hyper dungeon here we go
after press okay system will be rebooted
to make your change okay not on a reboot
right now okay we've also got Trend
Micro Titanium a su sonic master which
is something to do with the sound
evidently okay you can either use the
internal laptop speakers or probably
something else if you plug it in but
right now you can't so vocal clarity
surround base adaptive volume lower high
okay interesting okay next we have the
vibe Fun Center mmm actually let's get
back to that later because that sounds
fun okay we got web storage
we got Triple E cam so that's our webcam
Triple E cinema which is evidently some
kind of media player software okay so
videos okay you can add stuff to library
movies music woo you memo and there's a
little smiley face cool
oh yeah right okay so I can write a memo
yeah yeah okay so can't oh hold on it's
like the memo pad background sure let's
go with pink okay oh and then I can
select this kind of marker I'll open the
cover open okay I can select okay let's
go with this camera can
ah that man back
yeah okay so I can clear all or I can
erased
oh yeah you're racing doesn't work very
well I highly recommend not using that
eraser because it works like a real
eraser it's just not very effective oh
you can choose all kinds of different
colors though for your markers which is
kind of neat keeping grey and black can
you take it it's kind of thing okay so
let's exit that so there's our memo pad
okay we have a paint which is probably
again some kind of touchscreen based
thing this looks fun so I can put in a
truck No
yeah there we go and then I can like
color it and stuff I got my crayon I got
my green that's all I'm gonna make a
green truck if you have kids I'm sure
this will be like a big hit and then
they can print it out and waste all your
toner and ink and then you'll be really
happy but still come on that's pretty
cool pretty cool okay so I made myself a
green and red truck no I don't think I
want to save those changes yeah I'm not
gonna be saving those changes
okay game part console sorry we're just
I'm just looking at all of the stuff
that comes pre-installed here guys so
why don't why don't I talk to you about
the overall spec of the Machine a little
bit as well let's find out what the
overall spec is oh I don't know how to
right click with the touchpad so let's
just go ahead and do this okay so this
is a core i5 650 so it's a 3.2 gigahertz
that is a dual core Core i5 so we have
four gigs of RAM in terms of our video
card I think we already mentioned this
before but it is a geforce 310 m 512 Meg
and so we've got our Nvidia control
panel here that's pretty much your basic
specs what do we have in terms of
storage
yeah I'll don't worry I'll have a look
at that in a minute Oh
write something let's go computer so in
terms of storage we have 500 gig drive
in here by the look of things
what's this okay so we've got you
sharing fun touch experience eTools why
don't we do a sharing let's see show web
storage okay
um use okay so this is basically just
quick links to the stuff that we've
already been having a look at here so
the paint journal sonic master okay cool
so you can pretty much get rid of all
those desktop shortcuts and just use
this so
I'm Park okay let's not worry too much
about game park right now I want to go
back to this one I am all about the vibe
Fun Center because that sounds pretty
good
oh okay back in a second alright so this
is what we find so there's something
about music yeah you know local artist
Carrie Underwood I really don't think
she's a local artist where I'm from but
that's okay
we've got games we've got radio so I can
listen to like local top 40 stations and
all that kind of stuff a learning doctor
Chinese elementary Chinese unit one oh
yeah okay and I'm probably pronouncing
that wrong okay there's lots of Chinese
lessons here why don't we try action
chicken invaders three let's try playing
this game okay give me a sec I'll see
how long it loads okay so far the sound
seems pretty good here I'm just in the
demo mode so this is chicken and Vader's
revenge of the yolk why don't we go if I
start a new mission here okay and
there's a fork there's a fork for the
pointer so oh nice nice okay so this is
just a 60 minute demo basically but you
use your mouse to do this so basically
this is a way for your kids to download
stuff on your computer
and that you'll have to remove later for
the most part oh you can eat all like
the burgers and like chicken wings I
don't know why burgers come out of the
chicken when you blow it up but okay you
can tap the fire button for single shots
or hold it for continuous fire that is a
Death Star with a yolk and that is some
good taunting going on okay I think
we're done um so thank you for checking
out my video don't forget to subscribe

reviews and other computer videos and
evidently gameplay footage from chicken
invaders 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
