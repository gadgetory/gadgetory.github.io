the lack of RT Exxon and the inflated
pricing of the RT X 2080 today is the
day that many of you have been waiting
for the launch of the less expensive and
more obtainable RT x 2070 but just
because something is affordable doesn't
mean you should buy it intrigued good
that's the point of this entire
paragraph it's called a hook and this
part is called a sponsor glasswire
allows you to instantly see your current
and past network activity detect malware
and block badly behaving apps on your PC
or Android device use offer code Linus
and get 25% off at the link below
the biggest headline feature of the 2070
somewhat ironically is the one that it
doesn't have so for the first time since
Nvidia changed to their current naming
scheme back in 2008 the 70 value
enthusiast card doesn't do SLI all that
remains of the 10 seventies SLI
functionality is this sad little cutout
in the shroud that no longer serves any
purpose whatsoever not that we've really
pushed SLI as a sensible solution for
years so I guess in videos slow march
towards killing what used to be one of
their highlight enthusiast features only
really bothers me on a nostalgic level
let's change gears now then to something
that bothers me a little bit more
objectively pricing with the enthusiast
r-tx cards this honestly didn't bother
me as much because the 80 series has
traditionally targeted the affluent
gamer who cares less about price to
performance and more about raw power but
the reference RTX 2070 is priced at 500
US dollars with the overclocked founders
Edition priced at 600 u.s. dollars that
puts these new 2070 cards not directly
up against the previous 1070 but rather
the gtx 1080 from nvidia x' last
generation lineup and AMD's vega 56 so
we'll be comparing all of these cards
today although sadly we'll only be using
our Intel bench since time was not on
our side like no joke we actually got
our card 18 hours before this video was
supposed to go live it's a good thing
Anthony's a good sport about this kind
of thing so with Deus Ex mankind divided
we get a pretty big jump in performance
over the GTX 1080 and that's pretty much
the end of that chapter with the rest of
our test suite getting just a few frames
per second more regardless of whether
we're looking at DirectX 11 or DirectX
12 3dmark immunogen superposition do
at the twenty seventy stretch its legs a
little bit more but overall we're in the
same ballpark as our reference GTX 1080
and a factory overclocked 1080 would
probably be on par when we hit it with
our productivity workloads though like
it's bigger cousins the r-tx 20 70
delivers consistently good performance
compared to the GTX 1080 of yesteryear
making it quite comparable in most cases
to even the RX Vegas 64 even in OpenCL
tasks like Lux mark that typically
favored Vega and in heavy lifting tasks
like most but not all of spec view perfs
professional rendering workloads it
should of course be noted that most
enthusiasts and professionals won't want
to go for a reference card like this one
preferring instead to opt for something
like this Strix but the thing is while
normally these beefier custom cards
quickly fall close to reference pricing
this time it might take a while the
$4.99 MSRP that NVIDIA has slapped on
two reference cards allegedly has their
partners selling these boards for
basically no margin and why should you
the consumer care about that well
because as a result you can expect to
pay closer to the founders edition 599
price point for custom board cards for
their foreseeable future and with this
being the lowest tier of GPU with tensor
course and our TX support that means
that 500 to 600 dollars will be the
lowest point of entry for these
technologies until Nvidia delivers a
3000 series refresh sometime in oh I
don't know let's say 2022 at the rate
that they're going so then our TX 2070
to buy or not to buy it's a really
complicated question so let's start with
the price on the surface it's not that
much higher than the 1080 that it traded
blows within our benchmarks but MSRP
aside aggressive sale prices have 1080s
as low as sixty five dollars cheaper
already and that's right now while we're
working on this video before the
he's 70 has even launched so I would
expect them to go lower still which
means that what we need to determine
then is if the features of the new gen
justify the added expense some of them
are pretty easy to evaluate like the
improved invention coder that outputs
similar quality real-time capture to
x264 fast with a negligible performance
hit that's going to be a huge hit for
anyone who games dreams go for it
other features well gets more
complicated because surprise there is
still no real r-tx games there's no real
content to set this thing apart from the
last gen or even to measure how much of
a performance impact that we might
expect from the real-time ray tracing
feature that Nvidia is banking on so
hard to sell these things that they put
it right in the name further
complicating the matter is the used
market right now so with the recent
cryptocurrency mining crash sites like
eBay have been absolutely flooded with
last generation high performance GPUs
and right now 1080 T eyes which perform
more like an RT X 2080 in conventional
games can be had for the same price as
an RT X 2070 and as we demonstrated in
this video
a used video card might not carry any
warranty but it'll perform exactly the
same after its heavy use as it did when
it was new we can't tell you not to buy
an RT X 2070 because it's it's fine I
guess but we can't tell you to buy it
because its main selling points are
still completely missing in action the
only thing that we really can say
conclusively today is that this launch
from Nvidia is all the evidence that we
need to say that they absolutely require
a competitor to keep their pricing in
line rather than follow the IT industry
standard of mostly inflationary pricing
increases that even Intel Intel
maintained through the 2nd to 6th
generation Core Series processor
launches remember this is when they had
no competition from AMD and speak of
Nvidia
kick the convention to the curb instead
of using the architectural improvements
to deliver more bang for the buck to
consumers nvidia has instead taken their
new products and basically plunked them
right down on top of the old ones so
instead of taking the money that you had
last year and getting more for it today
you can get more but you will just need
to shell out extra cash I mean the
argument from Nvidia might be that RT X
is what adds more bang for those bucks
but at this point I'm just being asked
to take their word for it and I can't do
that you know what I can do is tell you
guys about ting ting is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and satisfaction with ting when
you call them this is crazy you don't
speak to a robot you get put through
directly to a person who can help you
and you don't pay extra for the
privilege with ting you pay only for
what you use with the average bill
coming in at just 23 bucks a month per
device if you're stuck in a contract and
switch to ting they'll even cover 25% of
your cancellation fee and they have
lower mobile data rates than ever before
it's just $10 per gig beyond the second
gig so go check out their savings
calculator at Linus 2018 dot ting comm
and find out how much you'd be able to
save on ting we're gonna have that link
down below and if you use our link
you're gonna get 25 bucks off your bill
or towards a new phone so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
then I'm sorry I'm sorry NVIDIA staff
out there I mean we tried to be nice to
it but like what are we supposed to say
it's like faster video cards for more
expensive it's not like a huge win for
the average gamer maybe maybe non r-tx
what is it going to be a GTX 2060 this
is gonna get really confusing so if you
guys dislike this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link below also down there is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one no whoops no not like this one
we have cool shirts there though and our
community forum which you should totally
