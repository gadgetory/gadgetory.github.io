is probably what it would look like I'm
here with my affinity
triple 46-inch setup that I'll be using
for an episode of tech tips that may be
up before but it may be up after this
video actually goes up so I just want to
take you on a little tour through the
construction because if you actually
look around the room you can see it's
kind of a you know an empty space so I
figured hey why don't we use this for
for our setup and yeah so let's walk
through it so I found this couch
upstairs where people have to wait so
anyone who had to wait for anybody today
had to stand because I borrowed it we've
got the fence of lap board right here so
you can see that this guy I didn't unbox
them recently but it's a laser mouse and
rotating keyboard with a mousing surface
on the bottom of it
great game controller when you're
sitting on the couch I've got a wireless
xbox360 controller with my I grip it
rubberized analog stick covers all right
I got my remote for the TV over here
I've got the TV's themselves so these
are all Samsung and LCDs they learnt LED
backlit they're not super high-tech the
total cost for these three TVs at a big
box store was $3,000 so I mean yeah it's
a lot of money but it's not actually out
of reach to set up something like this
which is pretty cool because the
technology's just come so far I've got
that box for the phantom lap board I had
to kind of bomb eval this is random but
I had to sort of jury-rig something to
actually put the monitors on those so
these are all an Tek DF 30 boxes because
they're quite sturdy and they're just
kind of a you know glossy black box and
it looks pretty nice this is actually my
media PC from home so this is a
silverstone sdo one which in my opinion
was the best Sugo ever
although the SGO three is pretty good
too I've got a little I'm on display
which I actually I don't have the
application open right now but it shows
me like what media is playing the date
I'm inside I've got a Core i5 750 quad
core with a custom cable to ntek true
power 550 watt so you can see my 8 pin
connector for example is only exactly
long enough to reach the 8 pin connector
on the motherboard got a zul'aman CPU
cooler in there keep things nice and
cool nice and quiet and then normally I
keep a fairly modest video card in here
but as you can see I have clearly
upgraded it to the radio on 6870 and
what's really cool about this card is as
you'll see in my length comparison on my
blog it's not actually that long so you
can install it quite easily in a media
oriented or a mini ATX case and it'll
still work just great I got my wireless
I got a gigabyte motherboard in there ok
I think that's pretty much it I got my
Steam drive so you can see my Steam
drive back here runs off USB 3 contains
all my Steam games because I use an SSD
for my home computer so there's not
enough space to store my like
50-something Steam games so I've found
that that solution actually works pretty
well for me so this is HDMI cable I'm
using is a little bit finicky there we
go alright so we can here we can even go
around the back and start to check out
how everything's hooked up at the back
so as you may or may not know i Finity
requires at least one DisplayPort
compatible monitor so since most TVs in
fact all do not have DisplayPort what
we're using is an active display port
adapter back here so that's a mini
DisplayPort to DVI active adapter means
it costs about 100 bucks and you
actually have to power it via a USB port
so that's back there and that one is
running over to the far monitor then
we're using native HDMI to HDMI for the
middle monitor and last but not least
we're using a DVI to HDMI cable for the
left monitor when looking at them from
the front so what that means is that
we're using all native digital signals
but we are using adapters so the image
quality is all going to be identical
it's just a matter of cables at the back
so there you have it that's a little
tour the setup
so if you don't mind I'm just gonna sort
of oh yeah right camera man's reminding
me of something we had discussed that I
totally forgot so what I want you guys
to do is leave a comment at on the
bottom of this video and say first of
all if you installed this setup in your
living room tonight would you sleep
tonight and second of all if you
installed this what would you do how
would you make this setup better to suit
your personal needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
