blog I'll be unboxing the Thermaltake
Black Widow or black X USB to eSATA well
eSATA this is kind of a loose term I'm
using here USB to SATA drive adapter so
this is basically a little dock that
sits on your desk and you plug a hard
drive into the top of it and then you
plug a USB cable into the back so it
supports two and a half inch and three
and a half inch drives it is hot-swap
ready it is USB 2.0 it is Windows and
Mac ready and I think that pretty much
covers all of the pertinent specs so
without further ado I'm gonna get my
scissors here and we're gonna start
opening this thing up it's kind of a
neat product because did the use for
this it's going to be for people who
want to archive their data on hard
drives as it is right now hard drives
are one of the cheapest per gigabyte
storage mediums even compared to things
like DVD and blu-ray and they are also
quite durable like there's nothing that
can cause a hard drive to simply lose
its data over time whereas with
something like a flash drive that can
happen so the first thing we find in the
box is the black X itself so hold on let
me have a look at the accessories first
so I'll get to that in just a moment so
please read first you've got a little
user's guide as well as a little manual
thingamajiggy here that basically gives
you an introduction to the unit itself
okay and then they have how to set up
the software how to partition your drive
on Windows that's a good thing to know
how to do and then further on down in
the bottom oh we've got a power adapter
obviously especially for three and a
half inch drives you are going to need
external power so it's just your
standard wall wart there and then we
also have a USB cable this is USB a 2b
okay so it uses the same USB plug and
slickest
it's not that light but since it's
something that would sit on your desk
anyway I guess it's not that big of a
deal so on the front we've got the eject
button it feels kind of like like an
SNES like the actual feel of it is kind
of it feels very solid here is a power
LED that glows around the outside here
and then let's go around to the back of
the unit itself we've got little rubber
feet on the bottom so it doesn't slide
when it's sitting on your desk there's
your power button there's your power in
as well as your USB interface and then
on the top of the drive itself also
something I didn't mention before is
where you'll find the interface so right
inside there that's where your SATA
ports are so that's a SATA power and
then a SATA data and you can see that
without this flap down it's actually
just the right spacing for a tuna 1/2
inch notebook drive but with the flap up
the spacing is just right for a desktop
drive so when you insert the drive in
it's as simple as popping it in so that
the interface makes contact and then
when you want to take it out it's
totally hot-swap ready so you don't have
to turn off the unit or turn off your
computer you just press the button and
carefully remove your drive it's that
simple so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look of the
Thermaltake black X</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
