few interesting things to the table so
the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead and open it up
so this is a this is a second thing well
the second time you've encountered this
on this particular channel and what this
power supply is is an 80 plus Platinum
power supply so as I've sort of
discussed in the past already 80 plus
platinum is pretty much almost 90 plus I
think at a hundred percent load it can
go down as low as 89 percent efficiency
that is in the AC to DC conversion but
we're gonna go ahead and talk about some
of the other cool new things that this
power supply brings to the table very
shortly here so it is 80 plus Platinum
here we go
80 plus gold certified means that this X
has 90 plus power efficiency 80 plus
Platinum certified means okay so there
yeah so at least 92% power efficiency
and that is at the at the peak at sort
of the optimal level in its and its load
in its power in its efficiency curve all
right continuous power yeah okay so XFX
has got the true wattage guarantee yes
some power supplies are rated at
unrealistic sort of in unrealistic ways
so that is maybe they're rated for the
peak output or maybe they're rated for a
ha unrealistic testing environments like
25 degrees Celsius but XFX power
supplies guarantee they're advertised
why did you even it well above standard
operating conditions at 50 degrees
Celsius which is that'sthat's probably
even a little bit on the high side
clean power so power draw from your ACL
that is typically dirty with wilty
despite some fluctuations this is very
very true XFX power supplies give you
tight DC voltage regulation with minimal
AC ripple giving you safe or cleaner
power okay extreme he tested capacitors
up to 105 degrees whereas some of their
competitors are using Japanese caps but
they might only be rated for 85 degrees
this is all true they say they've
included all of the various
safety protections although one thing
that's going to be a little bit
challenging safety protection wise is
you guys have to bear in mind that
OCP overcurrent protection is yeah it's
kind of hard to implement on a single
rail power supply and this is a single
rail power supply that does go for all
single rail power supplies that is an
enormous amount of current running
through a single rail so just bear that
in mind
hybrid fan control is very cool the
power supply operates silently that is
the Fen does not turn on until it
reaches twenty percent load or twenty
five degrees now bearing in mind that
twenty percent load on a 1,000 watt
power supply is 200 watts I have yet to
see a system other than like an SLI
quad-core type system that idles at more
than 200 watts so that means your power
supply is pretty much gonna be off
ninety percent of the time whenever you
are not actually doing anything
intensive with it so that's very cool
so note hybrid mode is on the fennel not
beyond initially this does not indicate
a fan
sorry about that guys so yeah it will
turn on automatically when it's needed
also I should know I said the power
supply will be off 90% of the time I
meant the fan not the power supply so DC
to DC converter design is very efficient
and allows you to maximize the 12 volt
rail usage on your put on your power
supply so that means that almost all of
the rated power of this unit can be
delivered on the 12 volt rail so you can
see that that is 900 can you even read
that oh yeah you can well it's really
hard to see it in person but up to 996
watts can be pulled through the 12 volt
rail and then if you do use more +5 volt
or plus 3.3 volt you have up to 125
Watts on those two combined quiet a
hundred and thirty-five millimeter ball
bearing fan okay supports multiple
high-end graphics cards up to three
graphics cards natively high quality
Japanese brand capacitors connectors
included we'll get to that when we
actually open up the thing I just want
to go through and see if there's
anything else here so for real high
power gaming needs okay so this is EZ
rail is what they're calling their a
single 12 volt rail design so that's
single 12 volt rail as I mentioned
before does does have some challenges
and that you're running a lot of current
on one rail but it is the easiest way to
ensure that you're not
going to have these safety mechanisms of
your power supply accidentally shut down
your system when you actually just want
it to run so you don't have to worry
about which connectors you're plugging
into which graphics cards easy rail
allows you to not think about that
solidly this is really cool so check
this out they do a cutaway of the power
supply here you can see the modular
interfaces now modular hah okay so this
is a bit of a history lesson mocking
their power supplies when they first
started showing up in any real volume
were well known to be far less efficient
than a traditional wired power supply
and that was due to how inefficiently
how sloppily soldered and how poorly
designed the modular interfaces were at
the time now you do lose a little bit of
efficiency just by having plugs like
this that are plugging into something
else and maybe you're not making a
perfect connection all of that stuff but
so how was XFX able to achieve a modular
80 plus Platinum power supply is still
very efficient by the way the plus
platinum well that is or so they say by
using solid link so solid link instead
of using a PCB with soldering points and
AHA this is exactly what a traditional
modular interface looks like on the
inside they've used solid pieces of
metal to bridge the gap between the PCB
inside your power supply and the
connectors on the outside so that's very
very cool that's the first time I've
seen that it also comes with a five-year
warranty
and less wires less heat this is very
much true that's modular power supplies
in general because by having fewer
cables cluttering up your case you do
allow for better cooling for the rest of
your system they're gonna block less of
the cooling so full modular design solid
link hybrid fan mode okay lots of PCI
Express connectors and we are finally
ready to have a look at the unit itself
after we look at the included modular
connector so here you can see we've got
our 24-pin connector very nice feeling
cables actually nice flexible cables
what looks like a reasonably good
quality sleeving so it's not as opaque
as some of the ones I've seen in the
past but it's also much better than some
of the others that I've seen in the past
so it's got a sort of this length to it
fairly standard you should be able to
reach pretty much any 24 pin power
connector location on a
given motherboard the ones that are
usually more challenging or these 8-pin
ones so this looks also fairly long so
as long as you're in some kind of a
reasonable you know not like an uber
full tower case you probably won't need
an extension cable for these and then it
comes also with another four pin power
connector which looks a little something
like this
there we government so you got another
one of those now okay what else we got
here so we have two molex love this nice
conservative numbers of molex connectors
on one of the included modular cables
why do I like that because I use very
few molex connectors these days and when
I do I just need to run a couple of them
somewhere this one has three molex which
is great because I'm either using two or
three in a given build and this one uses
another three and then that does it for
molex we do have a molex to tool floppy
pin adapter just in case you still have
something that uses that well there's a
sound card or something like that and
then for PCIe we've got three two three
and three so for more peripheral
adapters you've got one here that's just
got two so you run that up to your
optical drive or drives and then you've
got a few more here that each have three
molex are three SATA connectors on them
and you'll use that for the bulk of your
drives here
Wow these are nice and heavy these got
some real heft to them gotta love heavy
wiring it always has that that quality
feel to it okay so these are I'm a big
fan of these these are dual PCIe - or
rather single connector - dual 6+2 pins
this is the most flexible possible way
of doing it pretty much any high-end
graphics card these days requires two
connectors so this way you can take this
one blue brick where you can see you've
got two separate connectors just kind of
coming out of it and then you plug that
into your card you've got three of these
so you can do up to three dual six pin
or dual eight pin or six plus eight pin
cards natively with this power supply or
you can even do actually you can even do
3r rather to make a sous Mars or
something like
because you've got six total connectors
all right we've got some included
thumbscrews black thumb screws for
mounting the power supply in your case
nice beefy power cable is included uses
a standard connector so you don't have
to worry about having a custom custom
cable you forget your your special cable
you go to a LAN or something you realize
it
all of a sudden it's a trip home which
is a real pain comes in a little bubble
wrap black package that looks very nice
XFX has done an outstanding job of
really setting aside the look of their
power supplies from everyone else
without making them look tacky because
that's the challenge that you run into a
lot of the time when you try and make
your product look different as you make
it look different in a bad way I don't
think XFX has done that at all so here's
our large 135 millimetre cooling fan you
can see they've got kind of a neat
cutaway look here but what they've done
in doing so is they've actually not made
the cooling efficiency any worse like
it's still quite closed inside so all of
the downdraft or updraft which ever way
you orient your power supply is going to
be focused on cooling their components
in the side so speaking of components
inside I'm going to have a look at their
solid link interface which I know
unfortunately I can't really see so I
guess we'll have to settle for the
outside so on the back we find kind of
your standard grille your power switch
on and off there's no 115 to 30 volt
selector because it has Universal input
so there's your power cable spot okay
let's move around to the other side so
there's your pro 1000 limited black
edition full modular power supply unit
so speaking of fully modular there is
your fully modular interface as well as
your important info to fan modes a
hybrid fan mode or the fan is always on
normal I would personally switch it this
way I'm a huge fan of this feature
hybrid fan mode very very cool being
able to have silence when my system is
idling from my power supply is just
amazing I don't mind if it turns on
while I'm gaming and while it's actually
providing all that juice but components
these days are so efficient at idle that
why would I why would I bother having
that
that's outstanding okay so motherboard
there's your 24 pin there's your CPU
eight pin there's your one two three
PCIe dual connectors then we've also got
one two three four five six
peripheral connectors and then finally
check out this one so that's either for
another eight pin or for another dual
PCIe connector so you have that
flexibility XFX has included two eight
pin where they hop here they're two
eight pin motherboard connector so you
can see that's designed to go into that
one and then this one is designed to go
into that one but you could also source
yourself an additional PCIe connector
and use that instead for up to four
graphics cards so yes this power supply
would be capable of powering four-way
SLI although I probably wouldn't do it
with four or five 80s or anything like
that because it is a thousand watt unit
and that's probably a little bit more
than it's designed to deliver so let's
go ahead and flip it over to the other
side where we can see X of X also has
their sort of you know their branding in
there illness you can see and once again
they've sort of designed the aesthetic
to look kind of cool but they put a
little plastic piece back there in order
to keep the cooling efficiency from
actually being affected by what they've
done so here we can see the specs again
on the unit itself very sharp looking
power supply XFX is so good at
aesthetics so thank you for checking out
