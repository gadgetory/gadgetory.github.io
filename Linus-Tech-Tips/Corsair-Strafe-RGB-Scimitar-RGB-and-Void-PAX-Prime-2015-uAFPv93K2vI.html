down in the description below also thank
you to a soos and Corsair to start the
ball rolling we've got the strafe RGB
this is very similar to the actual
original strafe if you want to see my
video on that click the card up here but
what's changed is well it's RGB the
backplate is no longer red because it
wouldn't really work with RGB anymore
now it's white actually reflects more
colors better which is pretty cool
they've also gotten more brightness and
vibrancy out of those LEDs but what's
really cool about this keyboard isn't
actually necessarily those kind of
things it's a new switch that they're
releasing with the keyboard called the
MX silent the MX silent is an exclusive
course our switch from Cherry which is I
think exclusive for them for a while
maybe not forever with the idea of this
island is that it's based off of a red
but it has a reduced travel time so
instead of a four millimeter travel
distance it now has a 3.7 meter
millimeter travel distance but with the
actuation point in the same spot which
is two millimeters so basically you
actually at the same time but you bought
a mode a little bit faster so it should
and theoretically be a faster experience
a lot of people say Reds are for gaming
so maybe silence or even a little bit
more for gaming that's what you guys
decide let me know later on when you try
it after you get one of these on Twitter
next up we have the Scimitar RGB mouse
this is a sixteen point eight million
color RGB mouse similar to the keyboard
we just checked out and just like the
keyboard you can configure all of the
colors to match your other peripherals
through the q software the sensor of
this thing is a thirty nine eighty eight
which has twelve thousand dpi and that's
actually based off the same sensor that
was in the Sabre RGB if you guys are
familiar with that Mouse it has twelve
macro buttons on the side which is cool
and these macro buttons are Panasonic
mechanical switches which is actually
also pretty badass but a constant
problem that people have with these MMO
styled Mouse or some people use these
from MOBAs as well is that it might be
in the wrong position so of course
they're solve that problem or address
that problem but make it so you can move
this bank of keys up or back for a total
travel distance of eight millimeters by
using a hex screw that's on the
autumn of the mouse it also has a dpi
indicator hidden just in front of that
movable bank of macro keys and the
general construction of the most is
actually very similar to other models of
course are my so if you're already a fan
of the form factor is not going to be
that different for you which is probably
a good thing next up is the void series
of headsets these have some pretty cool
new tech on it so each one of the mics
in this series has what's called info
mic on the end of it
the front led will basically tell you
whether or not your mic is muted which
could be helpful depending on what
activities you do it your computer
throughout the day and then the light on
the back there's not the back just a
little bit further back from the other
one will tell you some other stuff like
what EQ setting you're using if your
battery's running out
or if you're running Dolby or not and it
can change color and do some other stuff
depending on that there's also a Q
control dial which can change things
like it's a multi-function dial so you
can press it in to change your EQ you
can press and hold for Dolby toggles you
can turn Dolby on or off or you can move
it up or down to change your volume and
you can also do that rapidly if you hold
it up it will jump up to the top if you
hold it down they'll jump down to the
bottom for a quick mute there's actually
three different models within the void
lineup so starting at the top we've got
Wireless at 150 dollars that one has a
40 foot range of 2.4 gigahertz signal
which is pretty intense and 16 hours of
battery life which is also a lot for
headset good to see jumping down from
that we have the USB one which is about
$100 that one's very similar to the
wireless one just not Wireless and then
we have this stereo one that's just a
3.5 millimeter Jack cost 80 bucks and
actually has multi-platform support so
you can plug this into your phone into
your console I guess and into your PC
