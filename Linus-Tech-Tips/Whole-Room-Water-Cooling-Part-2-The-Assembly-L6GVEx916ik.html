our editing workstations together so
those are like core i7 six cores and GTX
Titans then we're going to take that
water we're gonna dig it out of the
building and then we're gonna put that
on a massive radiator so we're actually
taking all that heat and dissipating it
outside causing not only our systems to
run cooler but also our room in which we
do our work to be cooler yeah build
things all right bill you might want to
start on a new case oh yeah um I don't
know outside I don't know if they're
outside or inside I know that at least I
see four of them so then one more summer
yes I realized I was using pliers rather
than a wrench to tighten the fittings
onto the radiators
that's what happens when Linus decides
that one wrench is sufficient for the
seven people working on a project some
sacrifices sometimes it's fine we'll
probably have to use some extensions to
get all these to where they need to go
but we have those okay that's not a big
deal
um and it's going to push through yeah
and then once you get all these mounted
I might send you and David on a on a
field trip to Home Depot to figure out
figure out how like you might even have
to do it there and just get everything
mounted onto something onto something
that we can put up there that will be
strong enough and disappear if we have
to sacrifice airflow to the top fan to
put four screws into it or something
then that's what we have to do
we're realizing now that our idea for
hanging the rears might not work we'll
see I also have no idea how we're going
to get a ladder here does Home Depot
deliver if you buy things we could just
buy a ladder and then have to deliver it
okay
possibly either way we should make that
happy pretty soon colder yeah I hear you
guys so we also need the metal strips
and then the tubing will run from the
window up here down to here
were you planning to take someone with
you you still need to
let me look at it this way sure old
radiators yeah I was just doing the
exiting for the camera oh I was that you
would anything no okay
component selection was something that
was really important for us these are
the workstations that we're going to be
using to do the vast majority of our
work so they need to be really fast and
they need to be extremely reliable so
most of the systems are running the same
configuration so they're going to have
core i7 49 60 X 6 core processors and
though I don't know we may do a little
bit of overclocking we'll see it won't
be much they're all going to be running
on a Susac 79 deluxe motherboards that's
another board that we're particularly
fond of because it's the one that's been
on our graphics test bench since its
release and it's been extremely reliable
there they are all going to be running
32 gigs of kingston memory just you know
nothing super fancy and really fast or
anything but just nice reliable ddr3
memory and they're all going to be
running and this is where things start
to get really interesting NVIDIA GTX
Titan black editions now I had
originally reached out to Nvidia to get
GTX 780 s because Swift Tech was our
water cooling provider and they're only
full cover water block from this
generation supports the 780 the 780 Ti
the Titan in the Titan black on the
reference PCB and NVIDIA kind of went
well you know don't you guys need double
precision and all dat video memory so
they ended up sending over Titan blacks
fortunately because I had already asked
for the power supplies from Coolermaster
at that point the v7 50 modular power
supplies that they're sending over are
80 plus gold and 750 watts is plenty for
a 6 core and a Titan black you don't
actually want to go that overkill
because if you do you can actually lose
some of the efficiency that you're
trying to gain by going with a highly
efficient power supply code for the
cases we went with Coolermaster and six
hundreds Luke and I actually spent a
fair bit of time figuring out a case
that was compact lightweight and not
professional enough looking that it
wouldn't look out a place in an office
and yet capable of holding the
enthusiast grade Hardware we needed and
most importantly was able to mount the
reservoir radiator combo unit on the top
that we wanted from Swift X so that we
could have one fewer component inside
each of the individual
system water cooling loops for when we
wanted to disconnect from the main loop
and run the systems on their own we won
with 49 60 X's for our workstations
because when it comes to video encoding
video rendering more cores really does
make a difference these aren't gaming
rigs these are meant for serious work
and having the extra course is going to
really help people get their jobs done
more efficiently which is very important
to me we went with Kingston for the
memory just because well it all comes
down to your personal experience and
none of us has ever had a bad experience
with Kingston memory so we reached out
to them to sponsor the project and they
actually agreed to chip in not only 32
gigs of ram per system but also boot SSD
so we've got 240 gig boot SSDs and they
also chipped in 64 gigs of HyperX memory
for edsel system because he apparently
thinks that he actually needs 64 gigs of
ram the BC building process was actually
kind of fun it takes me back I haven't
done a project this big in a long time
and you know the camaraderie and the
pizza and subway and all that good stuff
that's all part of that team-building
experience I thought was was pretty
entertaining one thing that was a bit of
a challenge for me is that I ended up
doing the finishing touches on most of
the systems because I water-cooled
the internals of all five of them I was
expecting to have some help but Luke
ended up doing a lot of benchmarking on
an Intel CPU launch rather than helping
me build systems so I had to do all the
the finishing moves myself when we
finally took all the systems over to a
table plugging into a keyboard and mouse
and had 30 seconds or so to make sure
that they post because they didn't have
any water in them it was a huge relief
for me when each one of them powered on
and displayed that you know all the RAM
was detected and all that good stuff I
love the wall decals I think they're
absolutely amazing I'm extremely pleased
with them in spite of our best efforts
to measure them out and put them exactly
centered I'm pretty sure the when
stealth one is about three inches off
sure but doesn't really matter the point
is I think they look great they were
quite a bit bigger than I was expecting
I know how big three feet is but I never
actually held a tape measure up to the
wall and kind of went yeah we're gonna
put this one here and this one there
because we didn't have the copper piping
on the wall yet so I didn't really know
exactly where the drops were going to
come down or anything like that I left
that up to Luke's dad so they're a
little big but they're super cool I
think the funniest thing about the
deckle process was that it apparently
takes three people to apply one wall
Beckel they came with two different
application methods one was with a
affront paper piece so you just take the
whole thing put it on and then kind of
peel that off and the spacing is all
right and that one was easy but the
other one didn't come with a front piece
because it was just a single deckle and
that one that one was a three-man job
you can support the sticker or actually
hear my support the sticker can you go
across in that case um capture this
moment take it away
Nik also does not use drills very often
and first was screwing things backwards
so that was difficult aside from the
things David told me which I wasn't even
aware of Nik had additional challenges
with the drill he was using a masonry
drill bit the first time that I saw him
using it and I corrected that little
embarassed thing to realize I was using
the wrong one but I was I was actually
pretty out of my element on this project
I don't have much experience with
building anything so I think it was just
part of the learning process and luckily
we got it fixed at the end of the day
now the original plan for the radiators
on the window was I think three or four
triple rads
so we were gonna have a total of nine to
twelve fans and it wasn't going to be
that heavy so the idea was to hang it
from the fascia board but we got all the
rads and fans assembled and realized
that once we filled that with water
there was no way that was going to hang
from the fascia board we came up with a
new plan and it was you know three trips
to Home Depot later including one trip
where we had to try to buy a ladder
which was a challenge because they
wouldn't let us even try to put it into
the rental van and instead we had to pay
some guy in the parking lot to let us
just kind of put it in the back of his
truck and bring it to the to the office
for us but I think the plan we've got
now is gonna work with all of the
radiators mounted to the frame we did a
leak test on it and none of them are
leaking I am a little bit worried about
the head pressure of the pump I had
thought there's a long time since I've
used that pump I thought it had over 20
feet of head pressure
it looks like it's 12 so I'm really
uncertain about whether it's gonna be
strong enough and I wonder if we are
going to need an additional air bubbles
okay that doesn't pass solid water
inspect the fittings police
calm down
can we build a
