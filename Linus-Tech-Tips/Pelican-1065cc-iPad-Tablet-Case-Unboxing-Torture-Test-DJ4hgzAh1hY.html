Pelican 1065 hardback case which is an
iPad case or 10-inch tablets case was
that CES but this is our first time
having a chance to really look at it
hands on and yeah we're gonna stress
test it so I brought along this is my
personal iPad too so I am actually like
super hoping that this case survives the
stress test I've got the brightness
turned way down so you guys probably
can't even see that it's a working iPad
but there you go working iPad so no
scratches or dents of any sort of
reasonable level cuz I have a snug case
which I absolutely love by the way but
that's a slim case this is more like an
extreme ruggedized dust proof watertight
crush proof legendary Pelican lifetime
guarantee case so it's not an easy open
latches sealed shut under pressure and
impact a phone liner which has a unique
mold to protect iPads and tablets and a
watertight gasket around the outside
which has a tight seal when the case is
shut the automatic purge valve keeps
water and dust out while balancing air
pressure and it is tested for impacts up
to 3 feet and submersion to 3 feet now I
suspect it'll survive just looking at
having seen the case already in person I
suspect it'll survive a drop of more
than 3 feet to be perfectly honest but
there's only one way to find out
hahahaha
crazy crazy unboxing so there you go
let's have a look at the case itself
pelican so you know it's awesome it's a
nice strong plastic it has kind of a
hollow sound to it because there's
nothing inside there's that purge valve
here's the latch that has kind of a
two-stage latch so it's one two just
like that okay so we're gonna try and
open this up if I can actually figure
out how to do it okay what else we got
here oh yeah rugged hinges so like five
pieces of overlapping this and then
there's a little feet here so you can
put it down on stuff I don't know
alright let's see if I could yes there
we go so it had kind of a bit of a seal
going on so thank you for purchasing
pelican they sent me this one so I
didn't actually purchase it but there
you go
Pelican protector case and storm case
care and instructions so you know make
sure that you maintain your o-ring and
don't let it be
sort of cracked and and and let it go
bad overtime because that will not be a
good thing so speaking of the o-ring the
o-ring seal is right here and it's
actually more like instead of like a
rubber it's more like a a neoprene like
in terms of what the material feels like
so what you can see is that rather than
having like a flat surface against a
rubber o-ring it's more like an indented
surface here against like a neoprene
seal so this should actually be very
very waterproof and then the pieces here
are gonna prevent the screen from
getting scratched or anything else like
that so let's go ahead and Chuck the
tablet inside I wonder if it will fit
with the snug case you don't even have
to take off you're like you don't have
to take off your regular day-to-day case
although I don't think it's sealed 100%
well then it was like that so here we go
let's take it out of there so this is my
pristine 16 gig iPad which I really
really hope I'm not about to break so
we'll go ahead and put that in there
does it go in a particular way doesn't
really look like it all right
so we're gonna leave that on and I'm
going to cross my fingers that the
things we're about to do to it do not
destroy it
we'll be back I have to confess the
shaking inside it doesn't really inspire
confidence to the extent that I would
normally have with a pelican product but
here we go
here's a three foot drop test yeah okay
ah so the tablet survived our three foot
drop test let me do a four foot drop
test we're going right we're going right
for the corner here we're going for the
goods you guys so actually here you can
see what happened to the corner on it
last time do you want to check that out
so that's our three foot drop test let's
go ahead and hit it again four feet all
right yeah okay yeah okay no cracks no
no no damage of any sort inside got some
grass in here that's probably yeah you
know additional impact resistance okay
so I've had a lot of people ask how tall
I am especially in the context of how
I'm a lot shorter than slick so we're
going to do a five foot six inch drop
test because that's how tall I am
ready okay all right well the latch
hasn't come open which was the problem
we had with our otterbox iphone case and
you can see that our tablet has indeed
survived however when we dropped it from
that height you can see that we did get
somewhere on this corner right here so
as much as it was perfect for the three
foot and the four foot drop test sorry I
might be too close to the camera for
them to see that so there you go that's
what the the wear on that corner looks
like so I would have liked to see this
case a little bit more a little bit more
padded right around the edges so you can
actually see the spot where that corner
impacted but other than that it didn't
keep the screen from cracking it did
keep it from being damaged and I mean
the case is waterproof so if we were to
say for example I don't I don't really
want to dig it out of this puddle so I'm
not gonna do that but don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips we're in boxing's
reviews and other iPad tossing videos I
mean not that probably wouldn't break it
even actually that probably wouldn't
break a tablet wouldn't it we can do one
more
let's do iPad bullying I mean that's the
kind of thing that would break your
tablet and that's the kind of thing that
I would expect it you know we should
drop it right on the hinge no okay the
hinge because of its double lock
actually doesn't have any problems cool
okay yeah it's arrived it's good see
screen stolen still works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
