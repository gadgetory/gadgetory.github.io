unboxing of a product I got in the mail
these are a couple of NZXT fans and one
of them is a 120 millimeter and one of
them is a 140 millimeter so the first
thing I'm gonna do is the unboxing part
fans are really easy to unbox you just
open the box yeah there we go yes
excellent okay so why don't we have a
look at what's included as far as
accessories go first you have oh there
one screw short on this one you might
say there one screw short of a mounting
system ah probably just an innocent
mistake but it should be four screws
included for mounting and then also one
molex to three pin fan power adapter so
it's just kind of okay there you go so
you plug in your molex there and if you
have a bunch of fans then you can take
more than one of these and you can daisy
chain them together so you just kind of
plug this into here in theory yep there
you go and then you can power two bands
and then you can plug in more fans okay
so in terms of specs 120-millimeter fans
because they're smaller by a substantial
margin than 140 millimeter fans you need
to spin faster to move the same amount
of air or you can move more air at the
same noise level because the 140
millimeter fan can spin slower or spin
the same speed and movement either way
okay they're both 9 blade rifle bearing
fans so they're long lasting they have
sleeve cables and this is something that
NZXT has figured out that so few other
companies do is that using a higher
quality sleeving helps you can't see the
color the cables at all and they use a
nice long piece of heat shrink everyone
else seems averse to using more than
like 2 centimeters of heat shrink
because apparently it costs a lot of
money okay
and then here we go the actual specs of
the fans I'm just gonna let you read
that on your own should you so desire
cameraman let me know when we're focused
enough that they can pause it if they
feel like it and there's another one
here there you go that's good enough
okay so why don't we just plug these
fans in and then we can show you how
loud they are
more than anything else I guess we'll
just be comparing the two fans against
each other so I'm going to plug this
so that I cannot plug in both fans there
we go
so one here a camera I get close so that
you can you can hear the difference
between fan on and fan off so you have
to get really close to the fan that's
pretty quiet there's no way you're going
to be able to hear that okay and now
let's try the next one I suspect we're
going to have a very similar experience
given that they're they're both rated
for the same noise level hmm yep these
are both fairly slow fitting spinning
fans but as long as you've got a decent
case that shouldn't be a problem so
anyway there you go that's my unboxing
of the NZXT performance fan series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
