g.skill triple channel memory kit this
is a fairly basic kit in that the
timings and specs are not very
impressive until you get to the final
bit so first of all this is a 1600
megahertz kit so it's two gigs by three
sticks 1600 megahertz cast nine so it
uses nine nine nine twenty four times
we're gonna go ahead and get it out
there isn't really anything in
particular on the back triple channel
blah blah blah four core i7 so because
it's a triple channel kit it's going to
be optimized for the core i7 that's the
LGA 1366 core i7 not the 1156 one and
the interesting thing about this kit of
memory is the 1.5 volt rating do you
skills been doing this a lot lately
they've been taking all of their RAM and
they've been instead of rating it at a
certain speed with one point six five
volts which is the maximum recommended
by Intel they've been cutting them down
more and more so you see some g.skill
kits
down at 1.5 volts or even as low as one
point three five volts and what that
means besides the fact that you're going
to have it run cooler and use less power
it also means that you can potentially
get more overclocking out of it and now
do you skills famous for their overclock
ability but what that means is if you've
got a kit that's rated at a certain
speed 1.5 volt it will almost always
overclock higher than a kit that's rated
at the same speed with one point six
five volts so thank you for checking out
my quick unboxing of this g.skill 6g B&amp;amp;Q
triple channel memory kit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
