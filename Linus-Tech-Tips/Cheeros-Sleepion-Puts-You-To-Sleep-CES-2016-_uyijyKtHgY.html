checking out a product I did not expect
to see this is not a battery bank this
is something that will use sound light
and aroma to put you to sleep let's
check out the sleepy on Thank You
Squarespace for sending us to CES 2016
this year click the link in the video
description down below I'll start off
with aroma it's the most complicated and
interesting of the three they have this
crazy ceramic ring which is baked at a
very specific temperature it's like 400
and something degrees or whatever
anyways it results in a whole bunch of
tiny little holes being in the ceramic
that's I don't even think you can see I
can't really see them personally but you
drop one drop of three different types
of oil geranium lavender or Japanese
hino Kitri that's a Cypress type of tree
onto their it seeps in and then you fix
that on to the front of the sleepy on
unlike other oil sleep thingies it
doesn't do it by heat which makes the
aroma of really strong and aggressive
and abrasive it does it through
vibrations so it just kind of like
shakes the oil mixture out as you try to
fall asleep and it's much more soothing
and slow apparently which is good when
you're trying to sleep I think that
makes sense that's one drop for 24 hours
which is actually pretty solid I think
it wouldn't expect it to last forever
then you move on to sound it has 16
default sounds going from things like
crashing waves to just a soothing lake
or whatever that will maybe help you
fall slowly into sleep you could even
start with more aggressive ones like
crashing waves and eventually get to
something like the ambient noise of a
lake to try to move you into that final
REM sleep or you there's an aux input so
you can play your own white noise if you
want that being said don't look at this
thing like a bluetooth speaker i know
it's portable it has a battery on the
back which attacks just threw a magnet
and it has a micro USB power in so you
could power it actually through the wall
if you wanted to but it's not it's not
your Bluetooth speaker you're not going
to want to take this to the beach and
play music on it you might want to take
it to the beach and fall asleep nicely
that could be cool if you find an
isolated spot but yeah I don't know last
but not least is the moonlight which is
mounted on the back this is where they
can have started to lose me but then
they said it's backed by the research
institute of japan so
I don't know they probably know more
about this than I do so we'll see
there's a light on the back which glows
on your wall it's an arcing light so you
can actually see it on a very large part
of your wall it'll glow very lightly and
will kind of breathe or pulse and it's
supposed to simulate kind of what the
moon does which is pretty interesting
these three things in combination are
there to help you get into deep level
three and four REM sleep which is
supposed to help with things like your
immune system muscle development while
sleeping and tissue repair while
sleeping which is great I personally
actually have a hell of a time falling
asleep takes me like an hour every night
almost regardless of how tired I am so
if this thing works that's freaking
awesome next I want to call it their
danboard flower series this thing is
pretty small you can see it in the palm
of my hand it's 10050 milliamp hours as
a combined total of three point four
amps at 5 volts out it's pretty
seriously badass you can put this pretty
much anywhere and have over 10,000 hours
of battery life pretty sick now before
we go I've got two more things one isn't
one you comment down below what you
think of the sleepy on does it seem like
snake oil to you get it cuz oil stuff or
does it absolutely seem like it's going
to work I really hope it works I could
seriously use some help getting to sleep
next is if you do think it's going to
work maybe check out their Kickstarter
this isn't like it's actually gonna be a
thing I wouldn't worry about it they've
been in development for 15 years they're
already manufacturing them if you order
in the US you'll get it and I believe
the end of March beginning of April
timeframe like it's actually
manufacturing already don't worry about
it the more the reason why they went on
Kickstarter they're telling me was more
just to check what the market for sleep
was and what the hype was what their
market size was probably to figure out
manufacturing quotas not to figure out
manufacturing which is kind of an issue
thank you to Squarespace for sending us
to CES 2016 this year if you need a
website you can use square space to set
up your website if you want to make a
website about different oils that you
might want to use with the sleepy on or
something I don't know or like a best
sleep practices that would be a good way
to do that if you want to set up a blog
you do that with one of their template
engine things and if you want to make a
commerce site because you want to sell
custom oils for this or if you want to
market sleepy on somewhere that it's not
for sale if you have a store or
something like that you can do
through the commerce system if you
there's tons of different templates
there's cover page where you can set up
a one page site for resume or something
like that anyways sign up for a year
