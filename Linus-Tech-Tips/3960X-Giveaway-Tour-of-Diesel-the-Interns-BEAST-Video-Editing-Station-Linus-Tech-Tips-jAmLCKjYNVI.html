on me but whatever the other one and so
all you got to do is click the links in
the video description to check out the
contest rules and regulations for the
Ultrabook giveaway and to download the
app so here we are at the workstation of
the legendary diesel the intern followin
at diesel the intern on Twitter if you
guys aren't already he posts some behind
the scenes stuff and if you tweet him
your questions about camerawork or
editing or whatever else he's actually
pretty talented so he may be able to
help you out that's at his discretion
though of course it's on his own time
but I want to show you guys all of the
cool artifacts on this desk oh yeah we
have a really cool giveaway to announce
in addition to what Intel's doing
they've also sponsored us to give away
to 2:39 60x extreme edition processors
and 2 gigabyte x79 ud3 motherboards so
we're giving those away as bundles all
you have to do guys is check out the
link to the giveaway right here guys
click the link check out the rules and
regulations you just have to sign up for
the Linus tech tips forum and go ahead
and make a post and then there's ways to
get bonus entries by sharing things on
Twitter and Facebook and all that good
stuff as well so we're really excited
about that his workstation actually has
39 60 X but we're going to start with
the random crap on his desk so first of
all we have an a soos pro art 3l crap
what's the model this is the 246 Pro art
so this is with the 8-bit panel it is
absolutely bawling out balls to the
walls
awesome awesome monitor for doing all of
his color work and then this is just an
old sink master 215 T W that he uses as
a second screen for most of the time
watching youtube videos so I'm not sure
what I think of that but I mean it's
okay because he brings his own lenses to
work we actually haven't invested in any
lenses yet so these are his this is his
super zoomed in uber we do macros with
it like macro close-up lens and then
this is sort of one of his more sort of
normal lenses he's actually got four
lenses that we use all the time
slick and I don't know how to use the
fs700 though so we're not using any of
the lenses right now it's all sitting
over there and slicks using the Canon
x8n so there's a random SSD on his desk
no idea what's up with that there's a
microfiber cloth for cleaning things
there's a piece of paper with some
outlines for for an episode we were
filming there's his compact flash card
that he forgot another SD card SIM phone
swapper okay this is a mount for a
microphone for a camera here's a box for
an HTC one this is oh I believe this is
an ND filter so that's i've got two
polarized things and you can make it
either darker or lighter to allow more
or less light through if you have too
much light
this is his sp1 speaker from antec we
actually all love these things
internally because they they're they
produce a lot better sound than the jam
box and it's not actually more expensive
these are slick straight ends we were
wearing these for like a for like a
douchebag version of Linus in a video
that we made for Samsung that we're
actually going to be releasing on the
tech quickie channel so I'm like here
like this and then I'm having a
conversation with myself without the
douchebag glasses on the other side so
so yeah that's gonna be pretty fun we've
got an SD card reader this one's
ridiculous you can actually cut paste
off it you can only copy paste off of it
a couple thumb drives including
Kingston's HyperX thumb drive which is
really fast film charger on this thing
is awesome we have an x-ray ty one a
display calibrator so we
need to use it for the pro art because
it came pre calibrated but we calibrated
this just so that we could get some
usability out of it it's got a
calculator I think I'm the one who left
this here and then this is all crap that
I piled on his desk at the end of the
day today when I was cleaning something
else up it's some AMD motherboard some I
think there's actually an Intel CPU
there's an Intel CPU in this AMD thing
here so don't worry about that what's
this yeah I called it a pile of crap
guys but I didn't actually mean crap
there's a gtx titan sitting here I had
no idea that was there and then there's
actually three HTC phones including the
8's that we're giving away soon my 8 X
that I used for my 30-day trial and then
a 1s alright so here is his Buber
workstation
it's a shuttle which is probably the
first thing you'll notice about it but
it's very very it's a very well equipped
well endowed shuttle computer so he
actually has probably the best computer
out of any of the three of us because of
just how like bawling out this thing is
ok so check this out
so this is an X 79 shuttle so the first
thing you're gonna notice when you look
inside is that it has four dimm slots
it also supports LGA 2011 processors he
has a 39 60 X Extreme Edition 6 core
processor in here and you guys trust me
he actually needs it unlike most people
who run 6 cores who are not really
utilizing it to their to its full
potential I come in here all the time
and this thing is pinned at 100% because
of the kind of crazy stuff he's doing
with post-processing and all that all
that cool jazz also he had 16 gigs of
ram in here that wasn't good enough so
you guys are gonna see a little kingston
ad at the end of this video
that's because kingston generously
donated 32 gigs of ram for his
workstation so we could upgrade it so he
doesn't run out of ram all the time but
just in case he does i've actually added
check this out on this side here and
mSATA SSD that is used as a dedicated
page file so he has 32 gigs of ram and a
32 gig SSD that is only used for page
file other than that it does not get
used at all he also has a crucial M for
128 gig SSD for his boot drive but you
can't see that and a Western Digital
so after one terabyte for just general
local storage and scratch disk and all
that kind of good stuff
finally there's a Quadro 4000 and the
reason for the quadrille 4000 is that he
uses CUDA a lot in Adobe Premiere and
After Effects and this accelerates it
very very well supports all of the
Quadro features it's also single slot I
needed single slot because I wanted to
add this very special piece of hardware
so check this out guys ten gigabit cable
ok going into a ten gigabit card there
is a 10 gigabit infrastructure going on
at Linus Media Group now we're extremely
excited about it it makes it so that he
can edit things on our network storage
server on the fly with a throughput to
that server to and from it of about 600
megabytes per second so it is faster
than having an internal raid 0 array of
about 4 drives think about that for a
minute that is over the network
extremely cool it's a raid 6 running on
8 Seagate 3 terabyte drives generously
donated by Seagate actually when we got
this thing started so so that's pretty
awesome and that is it that is the
workstation of diesel the intern he
actually went through I didn't even
cover his peripherals so this is a k9t
that we that we weren't using for
anything else he won't use anything that
isn't mechanical so we went ahead and
allocated that to him and he's also he's
gone through about half a dozen mice and
he finally oh I clicked it so it's
turning on but he finally settled on the
SteelSeries I with a SteelSeries mouse
pad he found a lot of the other ones
were not very accurate when he was
working on little details if you've ever
used premiere or for that matter any of
Adobe's professional-level software
you'll know that all the icons are
really small and if you don't click them
exactly it often doesn't do what you
meant for it to do so
rendering machine let's see what he was
working on today there you go he was
working on a tech quickie as well as
well he's working on finding some music
for something so we can license it and
what else was he up to today I think
that's about it so thank you for
checking out this video guys and once
again don't forget to subscribe to fly
this tech tips
don't forget to check out the intel
lenovo ultra book giveaway don't forget
to download the intel app and don't
forget to head to the Linus tech tips
forum where we are giving away two
thirty nine sixty X gigabyte x79 ud3
motherboard combos and a huge thanks to
all of the sponsors for making all this
