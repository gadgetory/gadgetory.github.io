there's ways to get bonus entries by
sharing things on Twitter and Facebook
and all that good stuff as well so we're
really excited about that his
workstation actually has
30 960 X but we're going to start with
the random crap on his desk so first of
all we have an a sous pro art 30 crap
what's the model this is the 246 pro art
so this is with the 8-bit panel it is
absolutely bawling out balls to the
walls awesome awesome monitor for doing
all of his color work and then this is
just an old syncmaster 215 TW that he
uses as a second screen for most of the
time watching YouTube videos so I'm not
sure what I think of that but I mean
it's okay because he brings his own
lenses to work we actually haven't
invested in any lenses yet so these are
his this is his superb zoomed in uber we
do macros with it like macro closeup
wins and then this is sort of one of his
more sort of normal lenses he's actually
got four lenses that we use all the time
slick and I don't know how to use the
fs700 though so we're not using any of
the lenses right now it's all sitting
over there and slicks using the Canon
xa10 so there's a random SSD on his desk
no idea what's up with that there's a
microfiber cloth for cleaning things
there's a piece of paper with some
outlines for for an episode we were
filming there's his compact flash card
that he forgot another SD card sim phone
swap okay this is a mount for a
microphone for a camera here's a box for
HTC One this is oh I believe this is an
ND filter so I've got two polarized
things and you can make it either darker
or lighter to allow more or less light
through if you have too much light this
is his sp1 speaker from antec we
actually all love these things
internally because they there they
produce a lot better sound than the jam
box and it's not actually more expensive
these are slick straight ends we were
wearing these for like a for like a
douche bag version of Linus in a video
that we made for samsung that we're
actually going to be releasing on the
tech quickie channel so I'm like here
like this and then I'm having a
conversation with myself without the
douchebag glasses on the other side so
so yeah that's going to be pretty fun
we've got an SD card reader this one's
ridiculous you can actually cut paste
off it you can only copy paste off of it
a couple thumb drives including
Kingston's hyperx thumb drive which is
really fast charger on this thing's
awesome we have an x-ray tae-won a
display calibrator so we
need to use it for the pro art because
it came pre-calibrated but we calibrated
this just so that we could get some
usability out of it it's got a
calculator i think i'm the one who left
this here and then this is all crap that
I piled on his desk at the end of the
day today when I was cleaning something
else up it's some AMD motherboard some I
think there's actually an intel cpu
there's an intel cpu in this AMD thing
here so don't worry about that ah what's
this yeah I called it a pile of crap
guys but I didn't actually mean crap
there's a gtx titan sitting here i had
no idea that was there and then there's
actually three HTC phones including the
8s that we're giving away soon my 8x
that I used for my 30 day trial and then
a 1 s alright so here is his uber
workstation it's a shuttle which is
probably the first thing you'll notice
about it but it's very very it's a very
well equipped well-endowed shuttle
computer so he actually has probably the
best computer out of any of the three of
us because of just how like bawling out
this thing is okay so check this out so
this is an x79 shuttle so the first
thing you're going to notice when you
look inside is that it has four dimm
slots it also supports lga2011
processors he has a 30 960 X extreme
edition six core processor in here and
you guys trust me he actually needs it
unlike most people who run six course
who are not really utilizing it to the
to its full potential I come in here all
the time and this thing is pinned at a
hundred percent because of the kind of
crazy stuff he's doing with post
processing and all that all that cool
jazz also he had 16 gigs of ram in here
that wasn't good enough so you guys are
going to see a little kingston add at
the end of this video that's because
kingston generously donated 32 gigs of
ram for his workstation so we could
upgrade it so he doesn't run out of RAM
all the time but just in case he does
I've actually added check this out on
this side here an msata SSD that is used
as a dedicated page file so he has 32
gigs of ram and a 32 gig SSD that is
only used for page file other than that
it does not get used at all he also has
a crucial m4 128 gig SSD for his boot
drive but you can't see that and a
western digital
raptor one terabyte for just general
local storage and scratch disk and all
that kind of good stuff finally there's
a quadro 4000 and the reason for the
quadro 4000 is that he uses cuda a lot
in adobe premiere and after effects and
this accelerates it very very well
supports all of the quadro features it's
also single slot I needed single slot
because I wanted to add this very
special piece of hardware so check this
out guys 10 gigabit cable okay going
into a 10 gigabit card there is a 10
gigabit infrastructure going on at Linus
Media Group now we're extremely excited
about it it makes it so that he can edit
things on our network storage server on
the fly with a throughput to that server
to and from it of about six hundred
megabytes per second so it is faster
than having an internal raid 0 array of
about four drives think about that for a
minute that is over the network
extremely cool it's a raid 6 running on
8 seagate 3 terabyte drives generously
donated by seagate actually when we got
this thing started so so that's pretty
awesome and that is it that is the
workstation of diesel the intern he
actually went through I didn't even
cover his peripherals so this is a k90
that we that we weren't using for
anything else he won't use anything that
isn't mechanical so we went ahead and
allocated that to him and he's also he's
gone through about half a dozen mice and
he finally I clicked it so it's turning
on but he finally settled on the
steelseries I with a steelseries mouse
pad he found a lot of the other ones
were not very accurate when he was
working on little details if you've ever
used premier or for that matter any of
Adobe's professional level software
you'll know that all the icons are
really small and if you don't click them
exactly it often doesn't do what you
meant for it to do so rendering machine
let's see what he was working on today
there you go he was working on a tech
quickie as well as uh no he's working on
finding some music for something so we
can license it and what else was he up
to today I think that's about it so
