Netgear eight port gigabit ethernet
switch and the reason for using a switch
like this is that most people already
have a router if they're doing internet
connection sharing which normally
includes a four port switch but four
ports isn't always enough for all of the
computers and other devices in the house
for example in my house we've got four
desktop computers
Media PC any number of laptops as well
as a home server so by that point you're
connecting potentially as many as you
know six to eight devices by wired
Ethernet so what that means is that you
can use a switch in order to split the
connection out to a bunch of different
computers so I have one cable going over
power line into another room where it
goes into a gigabit switch just like
this one and then splits out to three
different four different computers
within that room it's a very convenient
way to network and it also allows you to
take advantage of full gigabit speeds
between any computers that are connected
to the gigabit switch without upgrading
your router so without further ado why
don't we start getting this switch open
here and I'll talk a little bit more
about it this is a trend that we're
seeing quite a bit of lately actually
and I want to open the plastic first and
then talk more about the product later
there we go okay and that is this green
movement here so most of the switch guys
are coming out with green models of
their switches and what that means is
that they consume less power because a
switch is intended to be an always-on
device you never really want to have to
go and manually turn on your network
switch when you want to transfer a file
between a computer and like set up an
internet connection right so a switch is
always on so the reason for these green
switches is that it'll use less power
okay I've talked to me too much about
that at this point all right here's what
we have included you have a Netgear
installation guide so they estimate that
it'll take about five to ten minutes to
set up they show you where to plug
things in awesome okay Thank You Nick
okay then you have a warranty and
support information card to register
your warranty all right and then you
have the switch itself but let's have a
look at the accessories for
not a whole lot in terms of accessories
so you've got a wall work and we're
power brick or whatever you want to call
it AC to DC adapter then you have a
stent that was it that was all I
normally I'd expect a product like this
to include an Ethernet cable but maybe
that's part of their part of their green
initiative is that they're not including
an Ethernet cable because I don't know
about you but I already have like a
million and one Ethernet cables and if
I'm buying an eight port gigabit switch
I probably already have an Ethernet
cable okay so let's take off this little
plastic cover there we go and this unit
actually feels quite heavy and solidly
built which is always kind of nice
because when you buy something and you
it feels like there's nothing to it it's
not usually quite as satisfying so why
don't we have a look at the side of the
unit to start so you can see that it is
compatible with ten hundred and one
thousand megabit per second okay so that
means you can get in real life transfers
actually on mine I get up to about
ninety megabytes per second between my
computer and my home server so it makes
for very very quick file transfers over
the network okay there's your branding
there's a power light that turns on when
you plug it in one two three four five
six seven and eight these will light up
in accordance to which plugs are plugged
in at the back then around to the other
side there is nothing on the talk you've
got some Netgear branding on the bottom
you have a diagram that's a very handy
diagram and it also gives you a color
code so blinking means you've got
activity on a particular port if the LAN
is green that means you're connected at
one gigabit per second and if it's
yellow in the light here that means
you're connected at either 10 or 100
megabit per second that's kind of a
useful feature to have anyway thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the
Netgear green gigabit switch yeah so
cameraman raged at me because I never
showed the back I never actually showed
the business end of the switch these are
the port's where you plug in your
Ethernet cables so up to eight normally
the way you'd consider is coming off
your router you plug into one of the
port's and then that can split that
router connection out to seven
additional computers as well there is
your power plug thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the Netgear gigabit
switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
