compensator this will be a computer with
no stops pulled for Titan X's 128
gigabytes of gddr5 1.2 terabyte nvme
drive from Intel and an Intel 59 60 X
and some benchmarks to crush if you want
to see more build logs in the future
wreck the like button let's do this
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
to try for free this won't be a
particularly hard computer to build it's
just gonna be kind of particularly epic
these white boxes if you guys are
wondering where the heck these are these
are all the Titan X's this is the SLI
bridge that I'm gonna have to use yep
128 case random just insane
Dominator platinum 2400 it comes with
lighting strips cool so you could take
your USB 3.0 header plug it in here and
then you'd have a USB 2.0 plug that you
could plug into your board down here
nice some cable management stuff that's
pretty cool some rings and take this
Keijo back here just so I have better
access to cable management stuff I kind
of hoped that these fans were separate
so this is for lights so there's I guess
3 yeah there's three different lighting
strips in this bag that comes with the
case you have these three knobs so you
can I guess control the brightness we'll
have to see later on when I put in the
motherboard I like having the case on
its side and this thing on its side is
huge
this block is far too large but my
problem with this case is I have to fit
it up here and I did it in totally the
wrong order
I should have installed this first all
right we are back to essentially nothing
Wow that's a problem these light cables
back here are super in a way there I'm
gonna squish on those at little LEDs but
I think they'll be okay wow that's close
clearance so yeah at this point I don't
know if I would necessarily recommend a
triple rad in this case I've already had
to undo a lot of screen things in I hate
that so much I've got the board back in
and the cooler is being fed through so I
just installed two screws into the
motherboard and I'm not gonna do any
more for now I just want to make sure
that I can get this cooler installed I
have to remove this obviously I'm not
gonna do that quite yet
because I just want to make sure it fits
first it's alright fractal good job
these short cables were like perfect I
think that's how I'm supposed to do it
where I wasn't that screwing oh these
are the ones I'm supposed to be using
the first one I got was this
done installed that was a nightmare so
we're now back on track
I'm gonna finish screwing in the
motherboard because I kind of gave up
after two screws
people like selfie stuff this might not
make a ton of aesthetic sense right now
once the graphics cards light up because
they're all stock coolers they'll all
have green lights and then it should
work how do I want to do the fans okay
so for the CPU pump I'm probably not
gonna go behind the motherboard
naturally and I'm gonna try to use this
splitter but it might not work okay so
now I have a little triple fan thing
going through the back kind of cool that
it can already reach I should have
install the power supply first god I
knew it
so the reason I just did all of that and
wasted a whole bunch of time time to do
a whole bunch more work is because this
cable can go like this instead of either
coming through this hole or going
through one of these holes and coming
all the way up and looking super dumb
I'm just going to go for gold and let's
tell everything right now before I
install this cooler
I think you've pretty graphics card in
it just looks a billion times better -
is it possible for MDOT to things like
super booming over half this plane whoa
look
cooling and this is going to be
interesting alright so we're just doing
some cable management
so we're getting really freakin close to
being done I have to put the glass
panels on but I want to test to make
sure the system works first and I have
to put the cover or the screws of the
gratis cards on and then we're pretty
much done but I wanted fans in the top
because the area of the computer that
has the graphics cards in it is going to
be very starved for air the chopsticks
win again oh my goodness the SLI bridge
chopsticks okay are like plates on I
know but there's no lights on
Oh dirt so it's not posting we're gonna
swap in a much the lower capacity
sixteen gigabyte you kiddin Ram
just nothing yeah I just wasn't posting
most of the time oh my god I don't have
time for this I would actually try CPU
first Oh the chip was dead
it's not posting and we're trying to
figure out why I've never tried oh so it
was CPU twice I don't know maybe it just
needed everything so what I'm doing now
is installing the PCI Express power to
another board are those chips dead or at
least one of them think so I'm building
her back
hey Linus
come check this out that's like internet
for me yeah so it comes in three RGB
lighting strips that you can control
manually on the back okay we might have
found the place that time you're like so
our top GPU GPU one is running at 52
degrees idle our second GPU is running
at 47 and 48 degrees idle our third GPU
is running at about forty four forty
five degrees idle and our last one
our fourth GPU is running at 37 degrees
idol so that bottom one is doing a lot
better than the others but we'll see how
much they heat up once we actually start
benchmarking
all right benchmarking is complete this
rake would have seriously benefited from
water cooling the graphics cards as they
were all riding on about twenty or
eighty three degrees and probably would
have done better with GPU boost if the
result wasn't eighty-three degrees all
the time our issue with the RAM ended up
being solved by a su saving the day
again there should be a public bios of
the one that we used fairly soon so
don't worry too much about that if you
want to recreate something here all that
being said issues did remain there were
micro stutters all over the place with
the sli setup that we had and it
rendered certain parts of certain games
almost unplayable our rig crushed 3d
mark and it was cool to get into the top
1% of systems even without overclocking
although if that leaderboard was based
on price for performance it probably
would have been a different story in
conclusion I'm happy with the results of
this experiment but the true conclusion
will come next year when we make the
compensator 2.0 this rig did really well
in the games we tested it in but we
don't really have any proper comparative
data for that because we never really
run our games on that insane of settings
all the time and yet again the parts we
chose were silly why were those parts
silly well four-way SLI is kind of nuts
check out Linus's scaling video here to
explore that more 128 gigabytes of ram
is also quite a bit over the top
check out Linus's video on that exact
very kit here and CPUs that tear a
little bit unnecessary for gaming or a
lot a bit unnecessary for gaming check
out my video on that here I hope you
guys enjoyed obvious exploration of the
bleeding edge
