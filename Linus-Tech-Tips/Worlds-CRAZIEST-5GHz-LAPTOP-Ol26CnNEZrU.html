like hey do you guys want to check out
our latest and game okay just do you
want to check out our latest and
greatest hulking monstrosity of a gaming
laptop the g7o 3G I think it's got two
G's for like GG for like your opponents
won't know what hit him cuz it weighs
like a thousand pounds anyway we've kind
of been into the thin and light thing
lately so we message back we're like
well what's special about it and they go
oh well it's got six cores and it
overclocks to five gigahertz we were
like okay let's take a verse bin
thermal takes view 37 mid-tower case has
a fully modular design and can support
up to an e ATX motherboard check it out
at the link below to learn more all
right so we've got a sneaking suspicion
that we are going to need some extra
gear in order to make a 5 gigahertz
overclock stick so while Alex sets that
up over here I am going to unbox this
monstrosity whoa whoa that is heavy
right around here so it's already wow
this thing is thick
I mean just to put it in perspective
this is an ultrabook 4 scale that is a
razor blade stealth and that is the G
703 G I think this thing is even thicker
than the GX 800 isn't it about the same
I would say all right and the GX 800
though had dual 1080s in SLI in it I
mean that's one critical difference this
one's only got a single GTX 1080
with that said though we do understand
why they need all of this thickness and
that's because even though the GPU power
might not be as much it's actually
running an Intel Core i 9 CPU so this is
one of the first laptops out in the wild
with an Intel Core i 9 6 core mobile CPU
and the first one that we've seen that
is over clock Abul holy crap like it
feels like it's on a platform it's so
high above the desk this is crazy
these overclockable beasts according to
a seuss go from 45 watts up to a
whopping 160 watts
depending on the load that is why they
need a thicker chassis even though
they've only got one graphics card so we
suspect that we're gonna need some
cooling augmentation that's we're
blowing mature on over here potentially
comes in later that's the fastest laptop
we've ever seen so far
so 1800 in Cinebench yeah so that risin
laptop was $13.99 her so and that thing
was an 8 core processor
I mean let's take a closer look at this
thing got your USB look how small a USB
port looks next to it
SD card oh God Ethernet Thunderball USB
this and then check this out
HDMI mini DisplayPort every single one
of these vents you can even see the heat
pipe sticking out there every single one
of these is full of these dense dense
cooling fins and the fans inside are no
slouches either check this out okay when
I got my mic close to it hit it you can
really hear them spin up there goes a
benchmark
are we an overboost mode right now very
nice 99 degrees yes 99 degrees yeah even
when it sounds like that so we got one
point four to seven volts on the core
right there or one point three nine was
the highest but it's running at like for
up to four point eight gigahertz yeah
so that's like pretty crazy okay but can
it hold that speed at 99 degrees I think
it's going down to like 4.3 4.4
something like that okay so what's our
next step why does it have a dedicated
Xbox button we want the ROG gaming
center right okay go in full manual
apply manual yes we know damage your
stuff and now you just want to get rid
of that and restart it because it's it's
just bad all around okay so I noticed
you forgot to bring tape before for our
DIY shroud do we need tape for for our
DIY shroud we take duct tape and we kind
of like it's called duct tape so we
build a duct do that and then we put a
blowie Metron on there oh we want it
you'd want the blowing mature on like
down here wouldn't we so then there it's
helping the fans not blowing against
them no it would suck out oh I see what
yeah we need another power supply this
thing can't provide for for blowing the
Tron's they each draw five amps so
stupid here's where we're gonna find out
how well it handles it with just its own
fans right like in fairness to the
laptop if it if it does it okay then we
won't need any of this stuff it's not
going to yeah I don't think it's going
to do so what do we want here one point
seven one point two seven two seven
point seven can we make the turbo boost
power max 106 oh yeah it can go up to
two hundred according to its own default
all right that's a yeah 215s he's fine
apply good today
laptops laptops were not made for this
kind of thing that moment when you need
an external boot 750 watt power supply
to run your laptop just the fans just
just fill up the hence 4.8 gigahertz 1.2
seven volts it's been stable for the
last 20 seconds which i think is good
enough that's pretty good stability
testing yeah good work okay so we're
gonna try five
what's the CPU temp right now it's like
93 yeah I wonder if we just run
Cinebench now though if it'll be better
Oh blue screen alright you want to just
say screw faffing around with this and
just liquid metal it right now no more
fine - oh sure alright it's liquid metal
it my finger don't don't wheeze it
together like a typical I fix it tear
down is like so professional like it was
just like two guys reaming on a laptop
oh how did you hear that screw fall
meanwhile this is the battery you don't
buy a gaming laptop for the stellar
battery life alright so there's our GPU
GTX 1080 and I haven't seen this in a
long time
the CPU at Quora 9 CPU has the same
number of heat pipes to it as the entire
GPU GPU VRM and GPU memory oh that's
cool here's the it's got a built-in xbox
controller doodad I think the whole
assembly has to come off yeah we went
through the bottom of that boy alright
well that's one way to do it both the
CPU and the GPU have some kind of a
barrier on them already so we've got for
phase power over here and then we've got
this gigantic rectangular die and then
this like trippy rectangular package so
you can see here the PCI Express link to
the GPU is just right there on the
surface level of PCB we're gonna do the
GPU over in here right oh yeah okay cool
oh right I forgot about that side so
next step is to get some liquid metal
prepared good oh all right birds no just
kidding yeah you can keep that stuff and
you'll be fine really
yeah I wouldn't recommend it gallium is
fine though to eat like it's safe but
it's fine watch well people always say
like could you cool a person with liquid
metal no who says that people on the
forums all the time still beating in a
big way it's probably just not warm
enough whereas the CPU was sitting in my
hand like this the whole time
oh yeah okay so as long as we put this
on perfectly we won't get any excess
liquid metal all over anything and what
asus is going to think watching this
alright let's put this thing back
together so the cooler is back on so
technically we could run a test now it
doesn't have storage that's fine
yeah I'm sure they'll work without
screws no I can flip it over should be
okay we could also just put the bottom
on it Alex you only live once
just laptop might only live once see it
booted well let's do it you're only
gonna give it one point it's not gonna
be stable I think that'll be fine at one
point three all right
start testing okay I guess you were
right a little bit okay one point four
or five this time one point four five
all right it's beautiful oh wow that is
beautiful right there
great better five gigahertz eighty
degrees holy crap why is the score lower
what just happened oh wait it says this
is maximum oh no current all right great
wait it's way down we were looking at
the wrong damn column
oh the power max is at 160 watts let's
just unlimited the things okay and
trying again it is still hitting the
current one that though it is - I think
when you drop the voltage oh yeah three
point nine this one hits this one
sitting four point something okay we
have to drop the voltage boom
all right unstable to five let's split
the difference
Oh
currently wait oh right we're riding the
line and we're hitting 94 degrees
oh is that our fastest yet yep I think
so yep okay so let's try one point four
one five this seems to be a matter of
just finding exactly the right balancing
point it's thermal throttling now but
now it's thermal throttling oh that was
even higher that's even this is our
highest score yet we almost broke 1,500
in Cinebench so now all we have to do is
cool it down a bit more yep okay bring
on the blow Emmett runs you want blacker
you want gray I'll take black all right
let's do this should we shut her down
for now doesn't need to be shut down
well why don't we investigate a little
bit first there's three heat pipes from
the CPU to this one so this is clearly
the main CPU cooler yeah so really
though this is the only one that we have
to beef up probably build out some
bottom ducts like this and then it will
it can stick to that so that it's less
likely to further it fall over I think
that's good all right okay so this is a
bit of a delicate operation well that
looks perfectly legitimate yeah I see
nothing wrong with this this might just
work should we like slowly ramp it up
what okay so yours thinking full force
right from the get-go
it is heaven
it's gonna be big so we just dropped
like six degrees at idle yeah let's go
it's go go I want to put another one on
I don't even think we're gonna need it
really yeah cuz remember - this one's
probably going to suck from the other
one - true
let's go go ahead hit it all right
are you even at 12 volt yeah can you go
higher
so 16 volts all right
okay here we go
70 at 82 oh is it gonna hold I think
it's gonna hold
I think it's gonna
come on oh I know right we hit like 94
degrees and no throttling 5 gigahertz in
a laptop
