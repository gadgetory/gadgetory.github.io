the ds4 11 from Synology so I don't know
if you guys are not familiar with Nass
brands but yeah Synology is like up here
in terms of the overall quality the user
experience I've never used one before
I'm just going based on hearsay but I'm
very excited to be checking this one out
and I will be using it so I have very
high expectations for this particular
nas enclosure this so this is a 4 Bay
let's go over the features first great
for file-sharing duh it's an S okay
webserver cool you can run a small
website off of it data protection read
so this this enclosure supports raid 0 1
5 6 and 10 yes it supports read 6 very
cool although with let's take a step
back let's take a step back raid 6 and a
four bay enclosure is actually kind of
brain-dead because raid 6 requires 2
drives for parity and destroys your
write performance whereas raid 10 will
also require 2 drives for parity and
will have fantastic performance so ok
maybe that's pointless but raid 5 is
good because you only need one parity
drive so you can have better capacity
than raid 10 ok mobile access ok using
your smartphone or whatever else DLNA
media server fully compliant with that
surveillance server compliant oh cool ok
PC backup is supported mail server
supported compatible with Windows Mac
and Linux no problem Windows ABS you
know what I actually don't know what
that means so feel free to leave a
comment on the video and let me know
online photo-sharing a print server ok
cool and so this is basically all that
stuff we just saw except like with
arrows interesting the ds4 11 is a
slightly higher performance than the 411
j with these NAS units it often comes
down to the performance of the network
controller so most of them are gigabit
now so that's less of an issue it used
to be that a lot of them were ten
hundred which is just way too slow in
this day and age and it also comes down
to the performance of the processor
because especially if you're running in
a raid configuration such as raid 5
which
is gonna be how exactly how I would want
to run this enclosure because wait five
means you use buckets if you have three
or four three terabyte drives
j-bot would give you 12 terabytes okay
so stick with me here guys - j-bot
however jaiva just a bunch of disks
doesn't provide any data redundancy so
any protection from a data from a hard
drive failure so not ideal raid one will
give you only six terabytes of storage
but will protect you from up to two hard
drive failures as long as they're not
both on the same on the same data mirror
okay so there's that raid 5 gives you 9
terabytes of data and will allow for up
to one outright drive failure so it's
the perfect balance although you do have
a bit of a performance impact our raid
10 gives you so raid 10 gives you great
performance and raid 5 will impact
performance negatively but right so that
right right right so in your ideal
configuration which is raid 5 to get the
most out of your storage drives that
you're paying good money for the
processor is a huge factor because the
faster your processor is the faster it
can calculate that parity bit that's
required for raid 5 operation and for
the redundancy that it provides let's go
ahead take all this stuff out let's have
a look at the unit itself so so for beam
has the whole front is basically
ventilated slits here you've also got
indicators for the four hard drives that
it is compatible with land indicator
status indicator and a power switch is
right at the front on the side you find
not a whole lot to write home about a
Synology a logo on the other side you
find a completely matching Synology logo
okay I think you say - no sorry - 60
millimeter fans round out the back those
look like low-profile fans yep hopefully
they're not too loud but I haven't fired
it up yet so I don't know yet power in
Gigabit LAN two USB 2.0 ports so that's
you know for your print server whatever
other functionality eats at a port so
that's kind of neat okay maybe there's
more of a point to raid 6 with this
thing than I thought if you want to run
something else off of it
reset switch so it's your hard reset
and it looks like you got thumbscrews to
take the whole sort of back apart now
what I want to know is how he actually
is like drivin here the bottom is on
little feet which is sort of good and ha
included accessories power adapter now
they're more different power cable
Ethernet cable screws to install drives
and apparently to install up a lot of
things okay welcome read this first
don't mind if I do
what's in here probably a Quick Start
Guide they come in lots of different
languages that's good except that that I
can't find English come on welcome there
we go ah thank you for purchasing this
check this for compatible hard drives if
you buy red you'll know that it's
compatible or you'll early it's
something something you okay thank you
for that that's actually the most
useless read this first that I think
I've ever encountered warranty
information whatnot so yeah give me a
second here guys I'm gonna have to try
and figure out how to open this thing up
yeah I totally knocked out on those fans
those are standard profile eighty
millimeters so the fact that they're
using to larger fans in the back of a 4
B enclosure like this is very promising
this should be extremely quiet so let's
go ahead and load this in so you can see
its rear loaded oh I'm sorry I've never
even showed you guys wheat okay here
here Bobby turn the okay this comes off
now to get me remove the back piece yeah
so much rear loaded so we turned it
around to eat like that I take off the
four thumb screws and this just drops
down like this and then you can load in
your four drives just like that so I'm
gonna pull out these other sleds so you
guys can see the back flame that's built
into there they're using a proprietary
motherboard down in the bottom so let's
go ahead and actually let's check it out
there you go Marvel controller over
there whatever this is I'm sorry I'm
totally in the way of the camera here so
nothing out of the ordinary pretty much
there's all your activity led all of
your activity LEDs there's the that
looks like a PCI Express 4x interface or
like some kind of custom so you know
something depending on
kind of a chips that they're using
whatever none of that's really important
the point is the non J version has the
higher end the higher end processor and
actually this is a really this is a
really smooth installation you can
install that's why it comes with more
screws check this out
so besides installing the drives on the
sleds and sliding them in you can
actually install yet another longer
screw if you want even more security
like if you're gonna you know ship it
somewhere or something like that
pre-installed and then you just close
the back up and you're good to go so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
your first look at the BS 411 and I
haven't actually gone through the specs
so we're not quite done and there's no
specs on here that we didn't talk about
already so we're done and right why did
I say that WD reds are the ideal drive
so they have longer mean time between
failures longer warranty they have 24/7
phone support if you have any kind of a
problem they have Nazz optimized
firmware they also vibrate less so in a
multi drive enclosure like this they're
less likely to vibrate and interfere
with each other and they are validated
by WD and by the NOS makers to be
compatible so you don't even have to
look it up on a Synology website you'll
know that a red drive will work in your
nest thank you for checking out my
