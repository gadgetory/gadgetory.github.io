powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is course our
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCI XCOM it's day four of Computex
and we're kicking it off at our own base
here in the WD booth this is the red
drive a consumer-grade drive suitable
for applications where you have anywhere
from one to five drives in a raid
environment it only comes in up to three
terabyte capacities though ok so what if
you have something like this that
accepts ten drives what if you have
something like this that's just begging
to have six drives installed in it what
if you need four terabyte drives well
all of a sudden you're gonna be looking
at the wdse scalable capacity as well as
data center capacity so what the heck
does that even mean so number one is for
high-end consumers you can use a desktop
now as like this number two is that
because it shares so much DNA from the
re drive the raid Edition drive the more
traditional Enterprise Drive it is
suitable for applications such as cloud
storage so technology it's got a dual
stage actuator which basically amounts
to the head being able to read data off
of it more accurately so this is good it
has RAF technology and which basically
amounts to it being less susceptible to
vibrations from other drives causing
performance degradation
it has TL er which allows it to not drop
out of raid arrays even in well
difficult circumstances and last but not
least it has stable Trac technology
which makes it less likely to transmit
vibrations to other drives all of these
things are optimized for multi drive
configurations so let's head over here
where we're talking about a pretty
serious multi drive configuration in
this kind of an application
traditionally they would have deployed
an Ari or raid Edition drive where it's
got a 1.4 million hour mean time between
failure is an extremely robust it is
rated for 24/7 365 operation what they
want a hundred percent duty cycle but if
you're Google Drive for example not all
of this data is going to be necessarily
accessed all the time so a 50 percent
duty
Michael might be okay that happens to be
what the SC's rated for also these
customers who are storing their pictures
or whatever else they're they're not
going to be accessing it necessarily you
know nearly as much so an 800,000 our
mean time between failure might also be
okay and last but not least because
these cloud storage applications are
moving away from being so dependent on
raid and moving more towards redundancy
as opposed to and replication as opposed
to complicated raid controllers all of a
sudden were in a situation where if a
drive suddenly dies you might have time
to at your leisure replace it because
you know that that data is replicated in
a couple of other places so customers
such as cloud storage companies who
don't need the the robustness of an AR
II but want capacity might lean towards
an SC because it sits in between the red
and the re in terms of pricing meaning
you can get that capacity you need you
get that build quality that you need but
you can save a little bit as well but
what if you don't need the maximum in
capacity and you'd rather have the
maximum in performance this is the Delta
you DXE this is a SAS drive optimized
for as you may or may not have guessed
already based on what I just said
maximum performance it's a two and a
half inch drive which contributes to a
couple of cool things number one is that
it gives it outstanding random read and
write performance because physically the
heads don't have to move as far to read
data off of the platter number two is
that it contributes to power savings you
can actually run these drives with an up
to 67% power reduction compared to a
three and a half inch equivalent now
there are some caveats
okay so you got compatibility with two
and a half inch or three and a half inch
drive sleds but you are stuck at a
maximum capacity of 900 gigabytes per
drive for a deployment like this so it's
pretty much well there you go
there's SE and re for maximum storage
space and maximum robustness and then
there's XE if you don't care quite as
much about those things as well as much
about storage space but you want maximum
performance and the robustness of the
drive is actually better than either the
other two as well with a
million our mean time between failure
