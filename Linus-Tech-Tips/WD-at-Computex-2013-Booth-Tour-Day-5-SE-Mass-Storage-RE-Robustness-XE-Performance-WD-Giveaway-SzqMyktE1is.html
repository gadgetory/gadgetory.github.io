2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm it's day 4 of computex and
we're kicking it off at our home base
here in the WD booth this is the red dry
the consumer grade drive suitable for
applications where you have anywhere
from one to five drives in a raid
environment it only comes in up to 3
terabyte capacities though okay so what
if you have something like this that
accepts 10 drives what if you have
something like this that's just begging
to have 6 drives installed in it what if
you need for terabyte drives well all of
a sudden you're going to be looking at
the WD se scalable capacity as well as
data center capacity so what is what the
heck does that even mean so number one
is for high-end consumers you can use a
desktop now as like this number two is
that because it shares so much DNA from
the re drive the raid addition drive the
more traditional enterprise drive it is
suitable for applications such as cloud
storage so technology it's got a dual
stage actuator which basically amounts
to the head being able to read data off
of it more accurately so this is good it
has raft technology and which basically
amounts to it being less susceptible to
vibrations from other drives causing
performance degradation it has TL er
which allows it to not drop out of raid
arrays even in well difficult
circumstances and last but not least it
has stable track technology which makes
it less likely to transmit vibrations to
other drives all of these things are
optimized for multi drive configurations
so let's head over here where we're
talking about a pretty serious multi
drive configuration in this kind of an
application traditionally they would
have deployed an re or raid edition
Drive where it's got a 1.4 million our
mean time between failure is extremely
robust it is rated for 24 7 365
operation with a 100-percent duty cycle
but if your google drive for example not
all of this data is going to be
necessarily accessed all the time so a
50-percent duties
might be okay that happens to be what
the SC's rated for also these customers
who are storing their pictures or
whatever else there they're not going to
be accessing it necessarily you know
nearly as much so an eight hundred
thousand our mean time between failure
might also be okay and last but not
least because these cloud storage
applications are moving away from being
so dependent on raid and moving more
towards redundancy as opposed to and
replication as opposed to complicated
raid controllers all of a sudden were in
a situation where if a drive suddenly
dies you might have time to at your
leisure replace it because you know that
that data is replicated in a couple of
other places so customers such as cloud
storage companies who don't need the the
robustness of an r e but want capacity
might lean towards an SC because it sits
in between the red and the re in terms
of pricing meaning you can get that
capacity you need you get that build
quality do you need but you can save a
little bit as well but what if you don't
need the maximum capacity and you'd
rather have the maximum and performance
this is the WD XE this is a SAS drive
optimized for as you may or may not have
guessed already based on what I just
said maximum performance it's a two and
a half inch drive which contributes to a
couple of cool things number one is that
it gives it outstanding random read and
write performance because physically the
heads don't have to move as far to read
data off of the platter number two is
that it contributes to power savings you
can actually run these drives with an up
to sixty seven percent power reduction
compared to a three and a half inch
equivalent now there are some caveats
okay so you got compatibility with two
and a half inch or three and a half inch
drives leads but you are stuck at a
maximum capacity of nine hundred
gigabytes per dr for a deployment like
this so it's pretty much well there you
go there's SE and re for maximum storage
space and maximum robustness and then
there's XE if you don't care quite as
much about those things as well as much
about storage space but you want maximum
performance and the robustness of the
drive is actually better than either the
other two as well with a
million our mean time between failure
