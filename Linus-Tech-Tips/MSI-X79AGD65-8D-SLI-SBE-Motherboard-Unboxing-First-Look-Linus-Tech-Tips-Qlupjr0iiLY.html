unboxing this is the msi x79 AGD 65 8d
so there are two versions of the GD 65
this is the 8d version I'll get into
what that means a little bit later top
quality and stability means we have yes
military class three components on this
particular board so MSI's military class
concept was introduced a couple of
generations ago and basically what it
amounted to was high quality components
that are designed to last a lot longer
than the three-year warranty then they
provide then they provided that they
provide in terms of certifications and
support we've got intel x79 chipset
supports intel core i7 up to extreme
edition hits the black logo windows 7
Radeon including crossfire X SLI and one
second
overclocking with OC Genie - let's go
ahead and flip over onto the back of the
board where we'll find a little bit of
information about military class 3 so we
have a second generation of dr or dr
moths we've got let's see three in one
package double the thermal protection
and it gives you an LED warning at 115
degrees and auto shuts down at 130
degrees so you are protected with double
thermal protection interesting highly
conductive polymerized capacitors or
hi-c caps which msi claims have up to an
eight times longer lifespan than
standard solid capacitors super ferrite
chokes were also part and CM solid caps
were also part of MSI's military class
ii concept which provide check this out
up to 12 years of constant full load
gaming lifetime and 40 years in an
office if you're still using this
computer in 40 years then it is time for
an upgrade world's first pci express
gen3 mainboard brand yes they were the
first with PCIe gen3 and this is a PCIe
gen3 board and this one's actually
awesome click BIOS to is a phenomenal
layout for the UEFI BIOS set in the
includes on their boards click BIOS one
was pretty good but I'd say Seuss's
implementation was a little bit better
with click BIOS - they've actually got
what I'd say is the fastest to navigate
BIOS implementation out there although I
haven't seen Asus or gigabytes x79
boards yet included is a little diagram
of your board pointing out all the
different late switches and slots and
what you can do with them there's a
couple things here that I would like to
actually you know what I'm just going to
leave this out and then we'll look at
them on the board itself here is a multi
GPU sli bridge here are your end
connectors which allow you to easily
plug in your front panel connectors as
well as one of your USB headers here we
have USB 3 back port IO shield with an
internal USB 3 connector so you can add
additional USB 3 ports to the back of
your system if you don't have front USB
3 there's your i/o shield here is your
drivers and utilities DVD go ahead and
download the latest from the msi website
here's a little msi quick installation
guide showing you how to do some of the
basics including hard drive installation
cpu installation all that good stuff
closely about SATA cable it's how many
SATA cables do we get we get four say
two three six gigabit per second cables
and a couple of molex to SATA power
adapters we also get one of these cool
adapters so this is an eSATA 2 SATA
cable a molex to dual SATA power cable
and then two eSATA ports and a molex
support so we can plug in two bare
drives externally which is great for
pulling data off drives when you don't
have an enclosure handy software
application user guides and finally a
user guide for the board itself now
let's pull out the board itself because
we have gone through all of the
accessories and look at that the board
is the package is open where the i/o
ports work this is a this is an
engineering sample board so I don't
expect the retail packaging to be
pristine just so you guys know your
board shouldn't come with holes on the
i/o ports I can pretty much assure you
of that so let's go ahead and
check out the layout so first let's take
off the sticker world's first PCI
Express gen3 will throw that on there
and this is an LGA 2011 socket so it
requires not one but two lever arms
there we go to pull it up or to rather
rather to unlock it it's an enormous
socket and then when you're putting it
back down you're gonna go ahead and
secure the CPU so this is the pin
protector you'll remove that when you
install your CPU and then you need to
put this one in first and then this one
in order to fully lock the CPU into the
socket so here's our power delivery
system going around the 2011 socket
which is only compatible with LG 2011
processors not backwards compatible
don't try and put a 1366 core i7 in
there it's not gonna work here we have
the 8d portion of this particular board
it does support quad channel ddr3 up to
8 dims which means that if you're using
8 gig dims yes it can support up to 64
gigs of memory no big deal pretty
outstanding so you're gonna want to
populate all four blue slots or all four
black slots that is the way the color
coding is going to work when you are
filling up these memory banks ok up here
in the top left in its ideal location we
have our 8 pin CPU connector and then
moving over to the right it's so funny
because this is usually where the vrm is
and I see like 4 4 slots here and I want
to say now we've got dual channel ddr3
Yap wrong wrong quad channel ddr3 ok so
here we have our 24 pin power connector
in its ideal location along the
right-hand edge we have a multi Bible
switch right here which allows you to
switch between two physical BIOS chips
for the ultimate in BIOS profiling and
also to backup in the event of a
corrupted BIOS very cool here on the
side we have 4 SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second ports and 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit per
second ports so you have some
flexibility there over here we have a
post diagnostic le
then we have a USB to front panel header
with charging so this allows you this is
a high-powered one which allows you to
charge your iPad for example
high-powered devices off of the front
ports that this one's plugged into this
is not the high-powered one we've also
got USB 3 front panel and then what else
we got here so we have actually we can
check this out so here's your front
panel connectors and then we've also got
your voice genie connector fascinating
so that looks like that's going to be a
an optional add-on for this particular
board because it didn't come with it
we've also got our OC Genie button which
is your one button overclocking built-in
power button and built-in direct OC
buttons so that is your your base clock
adjustments that you can make with your
physical buttons here front firewire
auxiliary power for the five PCIe 6 pin
connectors so if you do populate all
those you're gonna want to plug that in
and finally front panel audio so this
board has the works on it in terms of
the PCIe slot layout we've got one two
three four five six total slots remember
with all the space that these DIMMs are
taking up it's a lot harder to put a
slot here duh I mean look how long they
are so you are stuck with six PCIe slots
on most of the x79 boards that I've seen
so far we've got one two three that are
wired up for 16x connectivity and then
this guy right here is wired up for 8x
and this guy right here is also wired up
for 8x this is a PCIe 1x slot so your
ideal configuration on this board is
going to be to go one two three cards in
3-way SLI or crossfire with a single
additional slot left over for a sound
card or a raid card or some other kind
of card your night now if you install a
full sized dual slot card in this bottom
slot you're going to want to make sure
that you have a case like the Corsair
800 d that has eight expansion slots so
that you're going to have somewhere to
secure that card and somewhere to
exhaust the heat that is coming out the
back of it now let's go ahead and have a
look at the i/o ports on the back
the board so we've got a ps2 port yes
ps2 is here to stay it just keeps not
going away we've got one two three four
five six seven eight USB 2.0 ports a
CMOS clear switch here optical audio out
coaxial audio out fire wire as well as
Gigabit Ethernet two USB 3.0 ports and
7.1 audio out so thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the X
79 a GD 65 8 D this is the board that I
am planning to use on my NCIX comm
channel for our overclocking guide so
stay tuned for that it's going to be
exciting time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
