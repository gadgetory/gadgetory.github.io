weren't designed to fit the shape of
your head or a chair that wasn't
designed to comfortably hold your ass so
why then would you use a keyboard that
wasn't designed to perfectly match the
shape of your hands
well Kinesis doesn't think that you
should meet the freaky-deaky advantage
to a keyboard that aims to put ur gonna
mix first without sacrificing
productivity but at a bank breakin three
hundred and fifty dollars is there any
reason for you to use one of these
unless your doctor says you have to
let's finger it out
rose wills Cullinan mid-tower ATX case
features tempered glass panels for a
sleek aesthetic with ample expansion
check it out at the link below so there
is no doubt that the advantage to is
bound to twist some necks it seems that
in Kinesis is quest to make it all about
the best economic experience for your
hands they forgot about your eyes their
premium model has got this subjectively
awful attempt at a brushed looking gray
and black finish that they call graphite
the LED indicators and the label are
inexplicably off-center the USB cable is
unsaved and this might seem like a
nitpicky thing at this point but the
device is overall low weight and plastic
construction contribute to a less
premium first impression than the price
tag would suggest but beauty can be more
than skin-deep
there is absolutely no deck flex the
bottom feet keep it in place on your
desk you can connect a foot pedal to it
and all the switches are genuine
mechanical Cherry MX or ml's okay fine
so the build quality is good but let's
stop pussyfooting around and address the
elephant in the room why does it look
like that well the advantage to layout
is designed to mitigate the primary
stresses that typing on a conventional
keyboard imposes on the body so to
achieve this they split the board into
two key Wells one for each hand if you
have more than two hands this is not the
ergonomic keyboard for you hashtag sorry
not sorry
anyway this split positions the users
hands closer to shoulder width apart
reducing something called ulnar
deviation which occurs when your wrists
are bent outward
next they made the Kewell's concave to
keep your wrists straight and sloped to
keep your hands from sitting completely
pronated this increases blood
circulation in your forearms and there
are more customizations the keycaps
themselves are at varying heights so
that your middle finger won't be over
arched and your pinky can actually reach
tough and the ctrl Keys that your we
cast little finger would normally be
responsible for have been offloaded to
these clusters where your thumbs can
straight up do work instead of sitting
on the bench it's all sounds like
sensible stuff but like stuff that
nobody seems to have thought of right
here let's drop another economic bomb
the number pad has been embedded as a
secondary function in the right key well
in an effort to reduce the board's
overall footprint so you don't overreach
to operate the mouse straining the neck
and shoulders this all comes together
then to make the advantage to a very
comfortable keyboard one of our new
writers James has actually been using it
non-stop for two weeks without any need
for shaking out the wrists or any kind
of fatigue whatsoever
so economic AF but that doesn't mean
that those two weeks were completely
painless
contrary to Kinesis bold statement here
this thing has a steep learning curve in
theory I see their point but while at
first glance it looks like all the
letters are in their usual places hold
on hardcore typists may cringe at this
but the vast majority of the people at
our office actually use their index
finger to type the letter C this is
possible on a regular QWERTY layout
because the rows are staggered but on
the advantage to the keys are arranged
in vertical columns so back to my point
then if you were already a perfect
by-the-book typist the transition would
probably be fairly easy but if you also
have to unlearn some nasty habits at the
same time like using the wrong hand for
the B key pen your transition will
likely be much slower another
consequence of the concave design is
that the keys are a bit closer to each
other which again seems legit for both
speed and stamina but my gut you have no
idea how easy it is to overreach when
trying to type a comma or a period and
furthermore a large part of keyboard
productivity has to do with non typing
keystrokes talking about hotkeys talking
about home and end talking about the
arrows and remapping the muscle memory
that you've built up for these more
advanced actions takes a lot longer the
new way may be superior to the old way
like being able to copy/paste now
without leaving the home row but that
doesn't mean that you're not going to
have the urge to smash every time a miss
click on the now nearby arrow key sends
your cursor flying off the page so while
some things are straight-up awesome like
having backspace and delete front and
center other things like not having a
space bar on the left side are not and
what about gamers alright well I'll tell
you about gamers every key on this
keyboard is remappable without the use
of any software you heard me this
keyboard has a whole suite of badass
onboard options that make it pretty
alpha even without the fancy ergonomic
layout you can store multiple layout
profiles and macros on the keyboard
itself so they work on any machine you
plug into like really any machine that
supports USB keyboards is compatible and
your layouts and macros are saved as txt
files editable and email a bull by you
macros can be over 200 keystrokes long
and you can even change the speed at
which they get executed not bad but
should you buy this keyboard well the
advantage to isn't perfect it's really
pricey
honestly I wish the number pad was in
the middle instead of making me press
this button and yet what is that sound
even but if improved comfort Injury
Prevention and increased productivity
eventually are what you look for in a
keyboard well it just might be your type
so you've heard a VPN is great for
keeping your internet traffic
private from your internet service
provider and allowing you to use
services that are otherwise geo
restricted but you don't know how to do
it well good news tunnel bear is so easy
to use that my sister could do it no
offense Belle I love you very much but
Wow it's available for iOS Android PC
Mac there's even a Chrome extension and
you just press like one button and
tunnel bear does a couple of things it
encrypts your connection and makes it
appear to the services and websites you
use online as though you are some
anonymous person in some random country
and the best part is you can try it for
free with five hundred megabytes of data
and no credit card required just head
over to Tunnel Bear comm slash LTT and
when you upgrade to unlimited you can
even save 10% by using our link so
thanks for watching guys if this video
sucked do you know what to do but if it
was awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or maybe check out the link to
where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also down there
you'll find our merch store where we
have cool shirts like this yeah like
