a lot of really cool stuff on this channel,
stay tuned because our LGA 2011 overclocking guide
is coming soon.
And we make a lot of really funny jokes on this channel
but rarely do we create the perfect blend of cool stuff 
and humor the way that I am about to right now.
Ok, get this.
What's the only thing that's better than that gigantic curved 
3440x1440 IPS thunderbolt monitor
from LG that I reviewed a little while back?
Three gigantic curved 3440x1440 IPS thunderbolt monitors from LG!
Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about.
Welcome to part one of our epic surround setup series.
Also known as Ssss.
To start with, I'd like to clarify a couple of points 
that I made in my standalone video about this monitor, the LG 34UC97.
One, the complaint that I had about LG not having VESA mounts
available for purchase in many countries was only sort of correct.
You can't buy one, but you can contact 
your local LG office and get one for free.
So, yeah, that's better than being able to buy it.
And two, the backlight bleed 
that I observed in the corners of my engineering sample
was something that was addressed 
before the monitor ever went to mass production.
So since then, LG has provided two proper? 
like the same ones they send to customers
units to flank our original one for our surround setup here, 
and as you can see, they are much much better in this regard.
Which is where the joke at the beginning comes from.
I love this monitor. I love the size.
I love the 21:9 aspect ratio for working on things side-by-side.
I love it for movies and for games, 
and I find the curve just much more natural feeling to use.
So the only thing that could be better is obviously more of the same.
So here is the setup.
We pulled the two tables together 
so that we could actually fit the monitors and our PC
more on that one later together on the table 
and spent some quality time with the setup,
trying to look at it from a few different perspectives.
First up is content consumption and here, 
honestly, I don't think that it makes a ton of sense.
Most content that is available in this kind of 21:9 cinematic aspect ratio
is really meant to be enjoyed by itself,
without distractions, not alongside something else.
And if you wanted an auxiliary monitoring for web surfing
while watching movies 
then most people would probably be better served
by a more traditional aspect ratio monitor 
beside a single curved 21:9 anyway.
Although, if you are an extremely busy person
who loves movie trilogies 
and you figure you could save some time
by watching all three of them concurrently
then I guess this kind of thing is your bag, baby.
Next up is content creation, 
and this is where this kind of massive resolution and workspace
we are talking about 10,320 pixels by 1440 
for a total aspect ratio of about 63:9 really shines.
It's not necessarily about needing to work on,
you know, a movie that’s shot in, you know,
super super widescreen or something like that.
It's more about being able to spread out what you are doing, 
especially if you are using a machine
that has the RAM and CPU horses to keep up like our editor Edsel's editing rig,
with its twelve core workstation CPU and 64 gigs of RAM.
So I asked him to show me what he would put 
where if given the opportunity to work on something like this.
So as you can see, there is tons of room 
so you can spread out, you know,
footage over here for a Premiere project, 
have a nice large preview window
with multiple tracks for a massive video editing project,
and then there is even room to have multiple creation software applications 
open at a time like,for example, over here
he could have After Effects if he needed another workspace with…
ok, well, that's not After Effects, 
that's a Twitch stream, Reddit, and some other stuff…
So maybe Ed's not getting an upgrade like this any time soon
but if he did, something like this, 
maybe not all flat in front of you like this,
but in the middle of a command station type setup 
with a chair that swivels in the middle
and an actual purpose built appliances or peripherals
for scrubbing through something over here and monitoring over here,
something like that could be absolutely fantastic.
Think of the productivity potential for this kind of resolution.
I mean, it's unreal the amount of space there is spread out.
And on the subject of unreal, Linus, 
isn't that a game engine behind us?
Why yes it is, and I guess this is the time to introduce the gaming rig 
that will be powering the second
and final part in our series on this setup.
I call it, the Autobahn Hammer 
because it has no speed limits and if you question its greatest
then you will immediately get bad hammered from life.
It's got a core i7 5930K at 4.7 gigahertz, 
32 gigs of Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR4 RAM at 2666mHz,
Corsair AX 1500i 1500 watt 80 plus titanium power supply,
with an ASUS Rampage V Extreme Motherboard for all of the power
and PCI express slots that we could possibly need 
for our ultimate multi-way graphics card configuration,
which leads us to the piece de resistance for this stunner of a rig.
The up-until-now very difficult to find, 
the R9 290X Vapor X 8 gig from Sapphire.
We went with this card for one main reason 
and it wasn't the display outputs.
An R9 295X2 with its four mini-DP connectors
would have actually helped us avoid the need to use this display port hub
and have one monitor connected via HDMI at 50 hertz 
but it was chosen for its 8 gigs of RAM per GPU
because we wanted to see how much performance 
we could get at this resolution
and didn't want to be bottlenecked by our vRAM.
The conventional wisdom dictates that as texture quality and monitor resolution
both increase so does the need for larger and larger video frame buffers
and multi-card users have long lamented 
the amount of RAM on high-end graphics cards
because when you run in crossfire with normal 4 gig 290Xs,
the same data actually needs to be duplicated on both cards
So you are multiplying your theoretical GPU horsepower 
as you add more cards but your effective GPU RAM is staying the same.
Not an issue today.
These bad boys have overclock GPUs and 8 gigs of RAM
each for an effective 8 gigs in crossfire and lots of room 
to breathe in the Fractal Design Arc XL case.
All of you were asking what case we were using 
when I posted on Instagram.
So you are probably sitting there at this point going 
that sounds great, Linus, so bring on the benchmarks,
but this is where I actually want you guys to help me out a little bit.
While you watch me dinking around having way more fun 
than I should be allowed to have at work here,
give some thought to the games that you want to see us test
when we do our gaming focused follow up on this video in a week or so.
I would especially love to see suggestions for ones 
that handle field of view, UI elements, and aspect ratio scaling well
and correctly so that I can talk about the gaming experience with those titles.
But then, let's also throw in some titles 
that might not work perfectly
but will be demanding as well so that we can really get an idea 
of how these cards handle this kind of resolution,
which is very similar actually to the number of pixels
on Apple's recent 5K display, like truly next gen stuff.
So look forward to that guys and we'll see you next time 
on our ultimate, truly one-of-a-kind monitor setup part 2,
also known as Project Ssss.
