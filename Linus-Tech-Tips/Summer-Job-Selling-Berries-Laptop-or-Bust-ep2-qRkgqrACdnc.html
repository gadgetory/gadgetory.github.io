find out how much we can make by picking
and selling organic blueberries so
choosing a berry farm there's really
only a few factors that you need to bear
in mind quality of the berries whether
they allow you pick if there's some kind
of a gimmick for example NS the berry
farm that we're at today has organic
blueberries so we can put organic on our
signs and finally pricing is of course
going to be a major factor if you are
planning to resell them and try and make
a profit other than that in terms of
supplies we've got our own boxes because
most youpix will allow you to buy
carriers for your berries but they're
going to be more expensive we've got
some tape to make our boxes not have
holes in them some sunscreen and some
nitrile gloves so that we're not putting
our grubby fingers that we put up our
butts all over the berries before we I
don't think there's a thing are you put
your finger up your butt how do you help
evaluate your washer routine Alice do
you keep it in there Intel skull Canyon
nook features a 6th generation Core i7
processor and Thunderbolt 3 learn more
at the link in the video description ok
so I wanted to take boxes out into the
field not a thing apparently buckets got
it they're useful for more than just ice
cream
off we go
okay well that's about an hour of
picking then how'd you do
oh that's actually really close all
right I don't know I think you beat me
by a little bit yours looks a little bit
more filthy yeah but my corners are
empty let's see let's see there's only
one way to know for sure let's go yep
you bet Wow not bad
twenty-two pounds or 19 minus three for
the box with 19:19 pounds all right
I'm guessing G's is 25 the whole way
twenty three point two I won by one
point two pounds that I knew it was
closer than you thought it was okay so I
got twenty twenty point two pounds so we
got 39 pounds between the two of us with
an hour of picking so if we were here
that includes the inefficiencies of us
just starting to learn and all kind of
stuff because we're both going faster
into the end 39 pounds so if we were
here for four hours we should end up
with somewhere in the neighborhood of
about 160 pounds and if you started with
like a full day of picking got a whole
bunch of stock and then just did like
four hours every day after that or
something with half selling then you
could optimize how much you need to pick
versus how much you know you can sell
very interesting okay well let's take
our haul and let's uh let's go sell it
so while we built our model around us
picking the berries at the beginning of
the day and then going and selling them
there are some other options here in
fact when some of my family members
found out that I was going to a berry
farm today
they said oh hey can you get ten pounds
for me ten pounds for me and I found
myself picking up actually a lot more
berries than I needed to sell up the
side of the road today
so canvassing your neighborhood for
pre-orders might be an interesting way
to a never have any overstock even
though your margins are lower and B not
even necessarily have to pick because as
long as you can book orders at a price
that's higher than what you pay for the
pre picked ones in our case it's two
bucks per pound if we pick them or 250
per pound if we just buy them already
picked then you're still making money
either way
I got to say one of the coolest things
about this has been learning about jobs
that never would have even occurred to
me if I wasn't sitting in a boardroom
going like what are odd jobs you could
do like if you needed to make some cash
in the summer I like it
so what we're working on right now is
how to sell the 100 freaking pounds of
blueberries that we have to get rid of
in the next about three to four hours so
we're going to create ourselves some
some signage and let's see who can make
the best most eye-catching sign I
brought these are you gonna put them on
a sign no I'm gonna put them on my feet
so I'm like tie-dyed and pink okay yeah
okay let's do it uh-oh we can have
anything we want well I don't know where
we keep it we have markers for now okay
I like her I like your thinking with the
doubling up on the on the side
it looks like a mask like a carnival
mask we're gonna attempt to for a beat
it just looks like a different type of
crap yeah he does a dad bag there's just
a butt and a mask and then other letters
well that sucked a lot okay
yeah we'll listen up here's the story
about a little guy that lives in the
blueberry world I'm running out of ink
so I have kind of a panic moment when I
realized I didn't really think about
what direction my arrow was gonna point
and I think it's okay cuz if I stand
kind of that direction from the thing
and I go like this then we're good as
long as you're pointing towards a
driveway entrance which I think there's
one on each side so it doesn't really
suck
okay all right well then in that case
we're good let's go actually I'm gonna
get a clown wig yeah let's see if
there's anything else in the costume
costume bin
I think that guy looked at us we just
set up wherever first things first we
have a table we borrow this from our
neighbor it'll be helpful you can put
berries on it you can put your bags on
it you can do whatever I'll say and then
we have chairs because it's going to be
a long day a canopy for shade is gonna
be a huge plus if you're gonna be out
there for hours at a time protection for
both you and your berries that's a tree
that's okay I think you can kind of you
can kind of scooch probably around it a
little one cannot raise the roof until
one has a roof
please go throw on the post
we've got bags cuz we want to sell them
in bags not little tray things cuz the
tray things cost more we have little
tray things to display the berries so
that our table looks nice
if cool little chalky signboards to be
like a 2 pounds costed as much or
whatever else we have a digital kitchen
scale for weighing out our pounds of
berries
vinyl gloves so we can look like we're
being all hygienic and stuff let me look
like we use gloves while we pics them we
have measuring spoons I don't think we
need those those were for the lemonade
that we decided not to sell you can
still are you doing with your hair I
guess oh and we have a tablecloth that's
cute a couple things we sort of forgot
we're a cash box and some change because
people are unlikely to show up with
exact change so so that's a thing okay I
didn't want our blueberries to bake in
the Sun there so we pulled them into the
shade opening up the doors making sure
that they're not you know going to be
soft by the time we give them to anyone
we should still we should do one point
two five pounds is five bucks if people
really it's not going to be
- five anymore you yeah it will be no no
you had done the math problem um if they
have exact change they can buy however
much they want we don't care and we can
put it in a bag then yeah I'm free
making a few bits so I'm pre making some
bags I'm pre making some 1.25 pound bags
I'm going to have some 1 pound bags but
those are going to be hidden somewhere
else so the reason for that is we ran
into some pricing difficulties in that
we don't have change so we have to sell
1.25 pounds at 5 dollars in order for us
to have any hope of giving people change
to avoid a trip to the bank for a bunch
of quarters you guys want some
blueberries maybe it's three dollars and
99 cents a pound
it's four dollars $3 million cents a
pound
alright so here's what we have for
change
that's like can you not put money all
over the merchandise I am going to go
put up the signs and let's see if we can
start bringing in some customers here I
don't know how visible this is okay so
here we go I'm gonna go be one of those
dancing sign people never done that
before people turn here a lot of people
turn and go up one 84th Street instead
of going through on 60th Avenue
maybe if I positioned myself a little
smarter I could take advantage of people
coming up here as well oh no they're
honking at me wow I'm already humiliated
and it's only been three minutes you
know what's funny about this episode is
that because we have inventory if we
don't sell it we're actually just out
like $300 on berries
not insignificant
memories you know you want them people
are reading the sign I'm definitely
getting their attention so does one of
the recurring themes of these laptop or
bus videos become Linus failure montages
maybe I should have a price advertised
maybe that's what I'm missing because
our pricing is competitive but no one's
ever actually getting in there to look
at it there's a ghost cop car that's
like parked on the street there
hopefully just doing cell phone checks
but he could be staring at me oh I saw
them they thought about oh I think I
might add run one in so that would be
one in the first six minutes no they're
just getting gas are we really sitting
at zero customers for the first ten
minutes here oh I thought I saw someone
at the table but it was Eddie so
fricking the guy who stopped for Luke
wanted 250 a pound I mean we brought
them all the way here
yeah I know he said that Yvonne called
to say that a cop is still around and
apparently watching me they pretend they
can't see me I am the lowest of the low
hello they are technically not certified
organic the farm that we picked on that
said that they were organic that's this
is five bucks so we got our first sale
they were a little weird about the
cameras which is probably expected but
yeah that went pretty easy I was happy
we had the pre-made bags because she
said she would buy whatever and in half
just so happened that our pre-made bag
was 1.25 pounds so we got five bucks
instead of four bucks so that's good I'm
gonna keep the 1.25 pound bags promptly
displayed from talking to Berry Farms
people are doing this people are finding
a way to buy the berries wholesale and
sell them at berry stands on the side of
the road but the issue that I'm seeing
is startup cost establishing yourself as
an own provider of berries is going to
take a significant amount of time so
place where you sell them probably
affects your success a lot we're in kind
of a farming community here in Langley
so that guy expecting 250-pound pricing
there'll probably be a fair bit of that
but price doesn't seem like the only or
maybe even a major problem because we
can't even get anyone to pull over it
start up overhead includes a food
service license a vendor license as well
as some kind of an agreement with an
establishment that will let you sell
there so the clover hill market was nice
enough to let us do this for one day but
I think if we were to try to do it on an
ongoing basis we would either have to
play our students saving up for a laptop
card pretty hard or we would have to
compensate them in some way
adding still higher margin requirements
to an already difficult business wotcher
yeah your turn let's wait till this
light turns red I mean I'd say I'd say I
have a deep concern about there not
being anyone manning the booth for all
the customers right now but it doesn't
appear to be an issue I've shared any
insight that I can think of as I go
about why this might not be working or
things that we could do better feel free
to do the same do you want the Hat
I know but to keep the Sun off it's
actually pretty nice if you want the wig
to
sign tricks what up
almost broke the air oh yeah come on
some days one goes just be like a
fairies spin move reverse spin move drop
the sign raise the sign twirl the sign
it's where all the sign other way flip
it over turn it around
berries bison king berries do you want
me to verify for you on the scale okay
I look honest with my shirt here there
you are
thank you ma'am pleasure doing business
with you what we're actually making is a
video about different ways that students
can make money in the summer so we're
not students but we're trying different
business models for one day each and
then evaluating sort of how the numbers
work out and making a recommendation
based on that so far um YouTube
youtube.com slash Linus tech tips the
sort of theme anyway sorry dude would
you like some blueberries wonderful so
it's four bucks a pound which we found
was about a dollar fifty pound cheaper
than any of the supermarkets and they
are they're not certified organic but
they're from NS farms in Coquitlam and
it is an organic farm we know the owner
all that's on the up-and-up
you will take one wonderful and I
actually do have cheese fruit would you
like me to validate it okay oh you want
you want five pounds okay you will have
to give me one moment
yeah ah let me think for a second no no
I wasn't but what I can do is I can use
our already counted so here let's just
do a quick validation so that I know
that I'm not ripping you off what our
wait is here and oh that's five pounds
you want sorry did you say how much you
want i five huh okay okay and that's
what this is and I will start to put
that in two bags for you
how about if I give you this first yes
and then I hold me whole debate that
would be wonderful and we have more bags
than that if it comes to that yeah we
you know where we're trying our best to
sort of model it in a way that will be
easy for people to replicate if it turns
out to be successful so we were thinking
you can save some cost by using paper
bags and recycle the bags it's all very
friendly so we use reusable containers
to pick them all that kind of stuff so
we're just trying different things we're
not experts at this that's kind of the
point sad middle-aged right there
someone that the spoof go go quick
blueberries loser oh hey my sign is
broken
so these are five bucks treatment so
they're easier for change which is why
I'm done wonderful sign cool awesome
thank you very much all right so we've
divided them up into easier quantities
so one hunt one a one point two five
pounds is five bucks perfect thank you
very much have your day we just sit here
are you by bag then you can sit here and
eat from the bag she's at left as in me
oh I see it's the Royal we
so each one of those is 1.25 pounds
that's five bucks
hi bag yep see she said it's so loud
because it was just such a great price
you should get your taxi driver to give
some blueberries I would highly
recommend it although there is some
added cost of the taxi there they're
pretty good value
blueberries they're wonderful they're
blue so tell you what we're actually
packing it in for the day
take another one yeah yeah we won't be
able to do anything with at least some
of this inventory so yeah enjoy not you
I trust me I have much bigger fans than
you you couldn't way more than like 75
pounds it's a good thirty uh yeah some
of them are this is about eleven and a
half pounds so don't hit me don't hit
okay so don't haggle with me Oh enjoy
for you what did you give oh wow I see
how it is all right well that's only 20
hey hey your kid learned from the best
that's yeah that's uh what is hazel
the wigs not for sale my friend there's
got my DNA on it you could make another
Linus all right thanks guys good night
you guys
so an interesting thought we have about
our neighbor at the office Steve
dropping by to buy a 10 pound flat of
berries off me not to mention my two
family members each of which want ten
pounds of berries is that taking
pre-orders and selling at a lower margin
but a higher volume to friends and
family may be either a a way to get the
business kick-started or be just plain
more viable than the side of the road
method via which we made very little
over the course of an entire day all
right so we all know about the Pokemon
go craze well the app itself is great
subjectively but it'll drain the crap
out of your phone's battery enter the
ravpower 22,000 milliamp hour portable
charger it can charge an iPhone 6s up to
nine times and a galaxy s7 up to five
times you can actually charge up to
three devices at once with the USB ports
on the front and it's portable being
roughly the size of your handheld device
ish it features iSmart 2.0 technology
for faster charging and it's got a
lifetime warranty you can learn more at
the link in the video description and
you won't run out of battery when you're
playing Pokemon go anymore at least that
is if you buy one if you just look at
the link that won't help
so laptop or bust that is the question
and I think the only way to answer it is
to show you guys the spoils and the
other spoils yeah we have a lot of
blueberries left and we kind of need to
sell way more than we actually did the
the spoils having cash in your hand
isn't as great as it originally sounds
we would have had to sell at a rate of
what like four or five times the amount
that we actually did yeah in order for
us to make this feasible we'd have had
to sell a lot more blueberries we have
to account for the very high startup
cost I think there is a
tential model in here if you can find
enough people to preorder from you like
our neighbor Steve did you would have to
do a higher volume at a reduced margin
which in a nutshell is the produce
business yeah
and like you need a car and you need it
almost every day if not every two or
three days you have to have quite a bit
of upfront cost for the berries
themselves yes you're picking it but
they're still not that cheap and you
have to buy them like every couple days
so could you make money like this the
answer is yes but laptop or bust I'm
giving this one a thumbs down yeah
there's better things you could do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
