unboxing of a sony notebook this is a
notebook that I picked up for a family
member of mine so it is uh gets a
Linus's choice seal of approval
especially at the price but NCIX had it
at on their Black Friday sale where I
work so it has an Intel Core i3 370 M 4
gigs of ram a 500 gig drive it is a 14
inch notebook with a DVD rewrite role as
well as Windows 7 home premium it is
also a notebook in case there was any
confusion about that and this will be
the reintroduction of my unboxing knife
the one that I lost when I was traveling
because I left it on my keychain and
tried to get on an airplane which was
stupid don't do that so I have I finally
have my Spyderco knife back went and
bought another one and so I have broken
the seal and I can put that away let's
find out about this notebook has to be
perfectly blunt with you guys I don't
know much about it I bought it based on
one of my co-workers recommendations who
said this ones are really good deals on
sale this week grab it because you know
I know you need a notebook right now and
here we go so here we have Sony's
summary of the specs so it's the i3 370
M that's a 2.4 gigahertz dual-core
processor 14 inch display at 1366 by 768
in terms of graphics we are using the
Intel HD graphics which will be just
fine for my aunt and we have another
seal to break so I'm going to pull out
the knife again I want to really have a
close look at this notebook for you guys
because I want to know what I got myself
into here what's the model of this one
anyway this is the VAIO EA 33 FD I
probably should have mentioned that
before so in terms of packaging we've
got environmentally-friendly cardboard
packaging throughout the entire inside
so there's no foam as far as the eye can
see and let's have a look at what's in
here based on the weight I would say
it's probably the battery and it is so
we have the battery as well as the
adapter very reasonable size adapter not
too heavy which is nice if you're ever
traveling around with your laptop
and Plateau then we have the battery
itself which has a bit of a half - oh
it's a weird-shaped battery isn't it
look at that wonder how many cells it is
oh here we go it is a 3,500 milliamp
hour battery so runs out eleven point
one volt I guess that's all the
information we have at the moment let's
see what we got in terms of
documentation we have a cyber coupon of
2015 Quick Start Guide okay and then we
have the notebook itself oh I found some
foam that's okay I forgive them so
here's the piece that holds the laptop
itself it and then we can remove the
laptop so it's got a bit of a heft to it
but you expect that with a 14 inch unit
they're not quite what you'd consider a
thin and light and honestly structural
rigidity doesn't come from nowhere in
Sony laptops by and large are pretty
well built compared to some of the
lower-cost competitors so that's at
least what I have come to expect from
them so I don't necessarily need it to
be the lightest thing in the world there
we go I'm about that open okay sorry
this is taking so long guys there we go
I got foam removed I'm going to go ahead
and install the battery the top is a bit
of a fingerprint magnet already but well
that's yet another thing that I've come
to expect from pretty much every laptop
manufacturer out there no one seems to
be able to quite figure out a
fingerprint fingerprint proof coating so
as long as you don't mind wiping it down
once in a while it's not that big of a
deal unless you're like a total total
neat freak or whatever okay so let's
figure out how this goes in aha so the
battery installation is a little bit
different from what I'm used to it
actually operates on a little hinge here
so you just slide the battery in like
that so it's simpler than I had
originally thought now let's see if it
comes with any charge on the battery
whatsoever
my experience with recent notebooks has
been that it generally does so we've got
a little screen protector here on the
chiclet keyboard let's get this guy
opened up
and the hinge is actually quite nice a
lot of the time with laptop hinges you
can really tell if they're flimsily
built but this one seems to have a fair
amount of resistance to it and it feels
quite solid even when you take it right
to the ends and give it a little bit of
a push it doesn't have any locks on it
so that means that it's going to have to
hold itself close you can see once you
get close to the end it'll finish it off
for you and it holds itself shut quite
nicely but then when you give it a
little bit of force you can open it up
very easily in terms of the display it
looks like we're dealing with a glossy
screen here although it's not as bad as
some of the glossy screens I've seen in
terms of reflection so here maybe you
can kind of get it at sort of a
worst-case scenario angle you can see my
hand reflecting off the screen but
really it's not that bad even though
we're sitting in a office lighting right
now which is pretty much a worst-case
scenario so language selection I do have
to set this up properly because it is
for my aunt
so okay it'll be configured with English
you cannot change the language at a
later date are you sure you want to
continue okay okay so we've got one
touch access to vo care the web and
media gallery so the assist button
that'll be good for her and then we have
the web button as well as the media
gallery button let's have a look at the
keyboard itself because that's one of
the things that really sets us that's
one notebook apart from another for me
is the overall layout of the keyboard so
all of the major keys are where I'd
expect them it is a bilingual layout so
you're gonna find accent keys and all
kinds of characters in pink all over the
place but they haven't made too many
compromises that I'd be too unhappy with
if you have reasonable sized hands
you're going to be able to reach the
backspace key quite easily and you can
also reach the Enter key without too
much hassle the shift key is slightly
shortened but it's not in an
unreasonable position I've seen short
and shift keys that are like way over
here and it's just not comfortable to
type on the right shift key is not
shortened and you can reach it quite
easily as well we've got the sort of
normal complement of F keys as well as
we've got British pounds we've got it
yet we've got a whole bunch of different
stuff here oh cameraman wants to show
the all the different inputs though but
so here's our power here we've got
Gigabit LAN then we have VG as well as
HDMI I like this because you've got kind
of the the old standard and then the new
standard both supported by this
particular laptop we've got an esata/usb
combo port I love those those are so
cool and then we've got an Express card
slot here moving around to the front of
the notebook we will find a oh that's
right that's a memory stick slot then we
will find an SD slot
I'm glad Sony is finally starting to
support some of those industry standard
standards rather than only their own so
as these guys we've got a wireless
switch I can pretty much guarantee I'm
going to get a support call from her
about that at some point when she
accidentally turns it to off and then
here we've got a head phone as well as a
microphone jack and then on the other
side we've got three USB 2.0 ports as
well as the DVD Drive personally I don't
need a DVD drive for my laptop and I
would go for something a little bit
thinner a little bit lighter in place of
that but for a lot of people it is still
essential on the bottom we have hmm not
a whole lot we've got access to what
appears to be memory upgrade as well as
harddrive upgrade but that's about it
and realistically on a modern notebook
that's about all you should be upgrading
anyway oh and there's a Kensington lock
here that I missed before but yeah I
mean on a modern notebook you're not
going to be like upgrading the CPU and
upgrading the graphics so there's no
real point having easy easy access to
the whole thing now I'm just going to
type this name while you look away since
I don't want everyone to necessarily
know the name of my hand
she doesn't need a password I guess
that's pretty much all I wanted to
wanted to say overall the touchpad is
quite nice it's one of those textured
touch pads so this is this part is
smooth and the chassis itself oh that's
that's actually really solid the chassis
itself has very little flex to it I'm
just going to mash the keyboard a little
bit here you know what I should even
almost take this off the table because
the movement of the table is really
making it look like it has a lot more
flex and it does I'm just going to come
right down to the floor and I want you
guys to have a look at the keyboard and
compare this to your keyboard at home
see how my knuckles are all going white
I'm putting a lot of pressure on this
and there is no flex whatsoever in the
keyboard itself so that is how that is
what really separates the men from the
boys when you're talking the overall
build quality of a laptop is how much
the chassis gives when you take it and
you try to flex it like this or when you
try and push down on the keyboard so
that's it's not always all about specs
and all about screen size there's a lot
that goes into designing a laptop the
touchpad as I mentioned before is
textured so it's one of those ones
that's not going to get greasy and
sticky if you're using it for an
extended period of time it has a left
and right click button as we PC users
are accustomed to and like I said I
think that's pretty much all that I
wanted to say but thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the sony vaio and i'm
going to cheat here ea 33 FG and don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for more tech videos reviews unboxings
and pretty much whatever else I feel
like uploading to my channel as with
most new notebooks I should problems
yeah I one more thing guys sorry
as with most new notebooks one of the
first things you pretty much have to do
is go through and uninstall a bunch of
stuff so the first thing that popped up
when we got to the desktop was a battery
health status meter which is kind of
useful actually and then I just want to
show you guys exactly what comes
pre-installed so I'll probably remove
AccuWeather I'll remove arcsoft whatever
those things are I'll remove Evernote
anything I don't recognize I pretty much
remove Google Chrome though that's a
good thing to have installed by default
I don't mind not at all bunch of Intel
stuff Java this is all okay office 2010
trial nice to see that comes on it gives
you at least something to use while you
decide what route you want to go for
office Norton Internet Security I would
probably remove a lot of this a lot of
this stuff I would probably remove I
mean if I had da ps3 this would be kind
of cool I mean that's actually that's
that's neat and then now what else do we
have here so we've got a bunch more vaio
software vile care about control center
I'd probably nuke all of that although
before I do I'll check and see if
they're actually useful things that
she'll use and then I'll make a
judgement call from there so
thank you for checking out the video I'm
actually done now sorry guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
