wow did we do a pre-show welcome to the
wine show ah someone did a pre-show nice
yeah that's right um I was working I was
working too I noticed that mr. Colten
actually officially changed the start
time of the wine show family to 2 to 5
he changed it to 5 but then he told me
he changed it to 5 so it didn't work
well that's a fail yeah can't tell us
that you changed it to 5 we would have
like probably never noticed yep and we
would have like we would have tried
really hard to hit 4 o'clock or 4:30 and
then and then bran would have actually
hit 5 but he told us he changed it to 5
so now we're screwed
you can't make us comfortable I think we
should change it back to 4:30 yeah yeah
yeah and then change it back to 5 at
some time and don't tell us this week
was freaking crazy you want to talk
about you think that you Winton did yeah
it was it was actually really awesome so
yesterday this was a totally last minute
thing like I didn't find out until so
what was yesterday we're trying to plan
it for a little while yeah no no it's
been possibly happening for like weeks
yeah
but then so Thursday I went down for a
tour of monolith productions so they're
best known probably for their work on
road trips online okay I'm just gonna be
I knew them from that I actually made
probably like almost no I knew that did
that I played really yeah you played the
major saw might almost no amount of time
you know there's you know there's like a
fan server like there's a guy who is he
like packet sniffed to figure out what
the server was doing yeah and like it's
super broken like it's it's like
actually really really broken and
terrible like you basically can't do
anything and I think you have to enter
text commands in order to do things
oh yeah like it's like really broken and
it's still up but he's been working on
it like since it went down back in
whatever that would be like 2007 2009 I
don't remember when it went down what a
hobby yeah what a hobby indeed but
anyway sorry probably better known for
fear condemned fear too and then more
fear series definitely yeah yeah
so Middle Earth shadow of Mordor and
Middle Earth shadow of war yeah are
probably what they are better known for
developing and those last two have been
done since the Warner Brothers
acquisitions that's how they managed to
get the rights to me yeah
middle-earth games yeah so so anyway I
got to go down there and check these
guys out and I didn't find out that I
was going to be going until I think
Tuesday late Tuesday night and I left
here early frier Leith ursday morning so
I actually had to get up at like 6:15 in
the morning and then meet pella at the
office and then we had to leave the
office by about 7:30 7:45 that got us
down there for a little after 10:00 and
then we shot all day so we actually shot
for they have a lot of stuff at their
studio half hour lunch so we shot heard
like 10 hours or so and then we left
late at night we got some five guys on
the way back that was pretty sick yeah
go down to America without getting some
five guys in Canada what yeah how do you
know this is it cheaper than it is down
there because two burgers and one medium
fries was almost 30 Canadian dollars so
there's a fun guys in north van and just
like it's you know but it's there you
know whose host that's new oh wow that's
crazy
yeah I don't know if they're like
anywhere else yeah it doesn't look like
it oh cool okay well at any rate
specifically say Vancouver so we were
shooting there for like 10 hours and
and that place is so cool like I don't
want to give away everything it's
amazing it's great there but like oh do
these there's one in Surrey oh wow okay
I'm totally gonna go at some point yeah
the guy was like super amazing they were
really really open which was probably
the coolest thing about it yeah like
they you you there was one thing they
really wouldn't show us well they they
showed me actually they let me into the
server room but they wouldn't let us
film it yeah I'm not surprised and they
were you know there was stuff that I
wouldn't have even considered so the
server room is technically like Warner
Brothers property oh and yeah that makes
sense
yeah that makes a lot of sense and so
they couldn't give me details like how
fast their internet connection is they
couldn't tell me what speed their
internal networking is running at I just
thought it was cool that they do that on
site but they did tell me that their
internal networking is way beyond 10 gig
oh wow well you think about what they're
like animators are working on like the
size of some of the assets that they
must be working with how responsive it
needs to be they've got somewhere
between 150 and 200 people according to
glass door like yeah would have to be
pretty banging an infrastructure man
that would have been pretty cool I
totally understand why and it was cool
by the way yeah but we couldn't film it
yeah
but they did give us some cool stats so
they told us they have about 800
terabytes of storage on site which man
you should have seen you should have
seen the guy sniffing when I said oh hey
that's almost as much as we have because
you know like how many hard drives you
have is like yeah the the IDE serves
guys like dick measuring contest the
dick measuring contest at forum of like
the who has more storage basically
there's a well thread 100 terabyte club
I think I think so yeah yeah so that is
that is that's funny absolutely a thing
like he I always uh did you get to do
any stuff in the mocap room I didn't get
to actually do mocap ok yeah but they
were doing a shoot while we were there
oh cool and their mocap room is freaking
oh it's awesome it's super and two of
the guys that like I don't want to give
away everything from the
yeah I will talk a little bit about the
mocap room so it's got 39 cameras and
these are high frame rate cameras
although they said they usually record
at 60fps actually this I didn't put in
the video because there was there's so
much other stuff I left so I had eight
pages of notes that to get down to what
would typically be a script for us which
is usually about one in three-quarter
pages yeah I had to I mean obviously I
had to cut I had to cut cut cut cut cut
so this is really cool so those cameras
they have are fully capable of 120 FPS
capture or even higher and what they but
what they do is they capture at 60
because they were saying that actually
you end up throwing out a lot of that
data anyway when you're giving the mocap
data to the animators because it's for
video games and we're giving it to
animators so if you need to create
frames in between an action you just do
that yeah that makes sense like these
are just these are just data points that
the arm follows along it has a model
that's gonna just yeah run however many
frames per second it runs that I want to
talk more about it but maybe we'll wait
till people have seen the video sure
yeah there's a few more things I want to
talk about but I want to like spoil
spoil things that you very likely talked
about I think that video is due out in
about a week and a half so it shouldn't
be that long as it is Samuel I think
it'll be a simultaneous release on
floatplane and YouTube so yeah so that
was that was pretty cool that was kind
of the highlight of my week and you
mostly worked on flow playing stuff I
guess this week yeah I hired one guy
who's working mostly weekends maybe some
nights he's hopefully gonna be working
on the payment processing because it's
super bad right now
oh man so that's really awesome and
there's another guy who's confirmed to
join later next month
full-time
I'm not gonna be giving much more
information about those guys because you
know probationary periods and all that
kind of stuff but yeah that's exciting
because we need some help I said a lot
of stuff to do another really cool
update for floatplane and I'm not gonna
give away who it is but because I don't
know if this person have you talked to
him since then I wasn't even gonna say
this person's gender I didn't want to
give any hints whatsoever but there is
maybe I assumed maybe you assumed yeah
anyway I mean I don't know what we can
assume is that this person is human a
human person you know and that's all
drunk matters yeah so we do have someone
who will be joining us as the very first
third-party creator on floatplane we are
gonna there are so many guests doing
some pretty cool stuff to make it happen
it hopefully won't seem janky yeah
hopefully they seem janky like there's
some they're like basically our CMS so I
don't know if you guys are familiar with
the term but it stands for content
management system view and it refers to
like the uploading tool that where you
also create like your thumbnails and
titles and and you do like what where
you manage your captain yeah internally
we call it merging because it's kind of
because I come from retail and so it's
not enough to just put a product on the
shelf you have to merchandise it you
have to put all the little cool speeds
and feeds you have to set a price you
have to arrange them nicely and that's
the way that I see like a description
and tags and thumbnails so yeah so
that's where you like merge your video
and that or okay so in the last week and
a half well that's not seem that's not
entirely how it's happened because it's
been kind of bidding to hold on for a
long time okay but what stage was it at
a week and a half ago not close to ready
and then one guy specifically on my team
I'm not gonna call it your name because
I don't know a handle for you that isn't
actually your name so and I don't know
if you're cool with that anyways but one
guy specifically has been working on it
like crazy what you guys used to know is
cat boiler but is now AJ Jax net
because he changed his name well it's
good he changes boilers her highly
inappropriate I'm shortening AJ Jax net
- just a Jax I think I'm just gonna
catch ax but he's been doing work on
some the infrastructure stuff - I know
the Australian guys have had a little
bit of a server upgrade so hopefully
that goes a little bit better in the
future and there's some other stuff
going on and he's prepping for the new
human entity that will be joining
floatplane as well so yeah it's been a
group effort
CPS 1980 is upset that I speak like a
valley girl what and asked when I'm
going to grow out of it you know
I don't think it's how do you speak like
a valley girl like you know like like
you know like I sincerely doubt that I
will ever grow out of it if you want the
not like like this like then you're
probably going to want the scripted line
or - yes which is most of the most of
the more professional written reviews
but if you just want me talking like I
talked then it's going to be full-on
valley girl
valley girl Linus from now until the end
of time some set Vancouver is basically
like valley girls no it's just basically
like you know whatever like you know
it's funny because I only occasionally
notice it when other people do it
because to me it's such a natural part
of my manner of speaking that I just
don't even notice it yeah I don't notice
when someone doesn't do it I don't
notice when someone does do it I just
yeah yeah that's fair Wow Linus is
begging for likes no get it yeah I like
the joke get it
I actually have nothing nothing to say
should we get into topic yeah why don't
you wait we haven't even rolled the
intro no but we have to talk about the
topic oh no no that I mean they're right
here they're committed to watch a rise
in mobile it's throwing in a oh no
it's not it kind of sounded like you
said eh it's I mean I mean the Kenna
they do yeah yeah everybody food I mean
they made battlefront to everybody hey
we have a new sponsor yeah yeah what are
you percent off that's that's max yeah
and synergy yeah
and we're back anyways topics we have
rise in mobile announced that like not
like mobile phones will get into you are
determined to do the the highlight
topics thing I'm not gonna let shuts
down the revive network also GTX 10 78
TI so you're gonna go all ASMR to try to
get them to pay more attention to you
and whatever you're saying is there a
say more of two people talking at the
same time is that a thing you know what
you know there's too much stuff if that
thing exists there's a subreddit
somewhere that's enjoy what if there's
like a yeah let's let's just use the
term subreddit for now I wonder if
there's like a subreddit dedicated to
just like people talking about news like
not not like to ASMR one cup I think
that is slash are slash to SM art with
no I'm kidding I mean someone's gonna
make it now right yeah it would shock me
if by the end of when show today that
sub her did not exist a sting when
there's sometimes a top comment where
it's like they link to a subreddit and
people are like oh man I wish that
existed and then people go and actually
make it a thing because like someone
someone wishes that it existed I can mod
this I can be the mod for this subreddit
let's go I can be the mod for like a
two-person subreddit Thank You typically
that probably doesn't need moderation so
much speaking of websites that aren't
made yet but should be no no no be
kidding me Oh hold on hold on I wonder
if I just no no it's fine I'll do that
it looks like it's done well it's been
has been two weeks since this cuz I was
at twitchcon
I don't know so yeah it's been two weeks
since the Luc was wrong meme started and
I have to say I'm a little disappointed
in the Creator yeah yeah there's been an
instant there there was a Squarespace
page made and initially it was like oh
wow this is actually pretty good
especially considering the short amount
of time that was given for it to be
created and then there was a Twitter
made the guy the guy or girl or whatever
I don't know has been tweeting there's
been a discord created there's been
Instagram
yeah created but nothing has been done
with it really it's still the same
there's even the liger it's still the
same hold on there's wrong and then
coming coming soon nothing's been done
with it oh but I do have a site though
is this font mod 24 Linus was wrong
about Kyle yes it was just give it a
shot
just give it a little look oh look at
that picture
who knows get notified you can join what
does that even mean I don't know to be
completely honest is there anything else
going on on this web page sure the joke
was that
wrong about Pokemon I think there's
let's see Oh didn't know there was a
Linus was wrong comm yeah
yeah no so I don't know what you're
wrong about because that neither of the
websites have been like updated at all
so there's no like information or video
clips or anything you know what I'm
probably wrong about they probably are
just like you know what it is wrong to
be so perfect in every way
Wow Wow like it's wrong in the sense
that it defies reality you know you go
on like Metacritic and like pretend that
you're a game and I think you're doing
that on purpose now aren't you yeah all
right so our first our first topic Wow
we are haven't even started talking
about news um heck yeah well if you
don't talk about any news it can't be
fake news Wow that's the fakest news of
all time news that his and even news
there's nothing new about it Rison
mobile has been announced this was
posted by Purina on the forum yeah the
original article here is from my friend
dr. cut hrus over at Anand Ted I have to
say before we start I love these stats
I love stats for AMD's new stuff because
it's been so long since they've released
something else and they compare
themselves like a themselves yeah
they're like it's 200% faster a hundred
and twenty eight percent GPU performance
and the funny thing about it is that
like the AMD fanboys who have for all
these years been sayin that AMD had
competitive offerings are just like
Olivia's to the fact that AMD themselves
is acknowledging that they have a
product that is now competitive that is
anywhere between 40 to 400% their
previous best yeah hold on a second
you can't have it both ways
yeah and to be clear Intel fanboys and
NVIDIA fanboys are no less intolerable
oh no it's just it's all the same it's
just poor AMD fanboys have suffered in a
way that the other two groups have not
erina their grizzled though they've been
through some stuff they have been
through a level of denial that I think
would kill any other living being yeah
so you could think of them kind of like
cockroaches like I don't remember what
they're cold it's like a denial nuclear
holocaust yeah you're just like no no
you want me to die how about no no I'm
not use yeah
why because Rison but they didn't know
it was gonna be called Verizon but they
knew they were gonna rise again I it's
so funny cause like even right in the
name of the product
it's like Andy is painfully aware of
what's going on here yeah man oh okay
sorry what was the news again oh right
okay sell mobile Verizon seven twenty
seven hundred you with Vega ten is a
quad-core chip 2.2 base 3.7 gig turbo
that is freaking awesome it would have
been more impressive if Intel hadn't
also launched there you series
processors quite recently with quad core
with with quad core designs but at 15
watts man Zen is looking like it scales
down really nicely to these lower power
envelopes that's cool man
see what else they've got Zen plus Vega
that's another thing too is Vega might
not look particularly power efficient in
the RX Vega 56 and rx Vega 64 but what
you know if you talk to industry people
off the record what they'll say is that
well you know don't judge Vega based on
the products that it's in Vega is very
efficient if you actually scale down the
voltage and a lot of what's like I know
it's a double clocked basically yeah and
pretty much every chip company for a
while now has been going really hardcore
in the whole bring the temperatures down
make it more power efficient category
yeah but
it really matters for me is mobile stuff
mobile laptops mobile phones and if
they're gonna be really efficient with
those types of things than awesome are
you actually looking at me so funny okay
hold on hold on hold on
okay a non tech has those like ads from
around the web ads now they're terrible
and these are some of the worst I have
ever seen Oh check out that good hold on
doctor trick hold on hold on hold on
thank you from the web Canada market
failure thousands of iPhone 7s for only
$5 okay so I'm gonna stop you right
there that is a plus and that is not a
phone at all
ear plugs okay and this guy no I don't
remember him I don't remember me I bet I
can get IQ betta cannot gasp also this
is one of those ones
we're like when it's really small like
it could look kind of like looks to
people doing stuff does when it's up big
you're just like there's no way a
chiropractor is like yeah that's like
not the simple trick that they want you
to do look at this granny rich diet yeah
nothing too ungrateful children she
looks better shopping site where you
only pay if you win I think that's every
shopping site ever yeah you win when you
buy the thing yeah and that's when you
pay yeah you pay when you win you went
the prize is the thing but yeah I think
like maybe I'm missing something here
anyway um that's really glamourizing
shopping but yeah you win you win gave
me a lot of stuff and I'm giving you
hopefully in equivalence back in terms
of a product or age
shopping so anyway there's some pretty
cool designs coming with Rhys in Mobile
HP has an Envy x-360 coming with the
2500 you it's gonna have up to 512 gigas
SD or one terabyte hard drive 15.6 inch
display up to up to 8 gigs of ram what
what is this product yeah really
what why does it wait what who delivers
a product that only goes up to 8 gigs of
ram
today and it's like slim and sexy it's
an Envy it's like HP bought that brand
like how many of you or even have been
around long enough to remember voodoo PC
I do okay like we had one they bought
that brand and then just had they gave
Riley I bunch of money for it and then
he just completely disappeared off the
face of the earth no they made him a VP
for a bit and then like and then I think
it has got rid of him because I don't
but I feel like that they had something
to do with legging I'm assuming I have
no idea no rumors yeah nothing is it
just pure sign making assumptions - I'm
assuming that it was based off of a like
a vesting something or other
oh right there was probably like a
guaranteed investing shares to some
degree so he had to they wanted him to
come on is like advisory for a little
while yeah before he took off they just
had no idea to what to do with that
brand and now it's a laptop with eight
gigs of RAM the idea of had seven 20s
actually this is a weird one - up to
arisin seven 2700 year on single channel
memory which we already know is it
doesn't say how much not that optimal
for risin up to a one terabyte SSD so
it's a purely solid-state option maybe a
Sarah's gonna get gigs gigs up to 256
gig SSD this is a Super Value product I
mean maybe I'm missing something here
but why are we okay this Acer one wants
to take advantage of larger turbo modes
memory will be dual channel with even
even Ian although the system will only
support a gig yeah what's going on so it
looks on paper like rise and mobile
should be pretty competitive I mean at
those base and boost clocks this thing
should perform pretty well but you can
usually from how configured looked
before benchmarking something you know
how good something is going to be
because you got to understand like
partners like an HP or a Dell or you
know like a game studio when you're
talking about something like a
development kit for a console like
they've got access to the hardware or
some approximate appropriate agency the
quite some time yes I did
so usually you can tell how good they
think something is by the kinds of
designs they're planning to integrate it
into so this doesn't give me a lot of
confidence for rising mobile but hey I'd
love to be wrong there's some good AMD
news maybe we'll do that as our as our
next topic here before the news yeah
before we do our sponsor spot said it's
an ultrabook most won't need sixteen gig
also it uses more power so what the
razor blade stealth has shipped with 16
gigs of ram for two generations now
marginally more power yeah and i think a
surprising amount of people actually do
use that memory a lot of people are
trying to watch I didn't see the
resolution of the screens but a lot of
people are trying to watch like fairly
high res Netflix content which is good
memory foam you won't be running 4k so
there's that because right now that's
limited to Intel processors as far as I
know yeah yeah but yeah lots of YouTube
tabs in Chrome and Netflix tab in chrome
and Facebook and the reddit is gonna
really slam your memory propeller this
is while streaming like I'm not actually
even doing anything right now and I've
already got six while streaming off a
different PC yeah off a different so
this computer actually just has like
actually like nothing going on
well okay to be fair to you so you have
quite a few things up here like the
TeamViewer thing is not connected it's
not doing anything yeah one of those
things is notepad one of those things is
paint paint one of those things is share
share X which is not doing anything
that's also just telling me there's an
update but you don't because it already
does everything the Skyport is not
connected no it's just kind of sitting
there yeah it's not no it's not signed
in even it's not even don't even sign it
cuz I don't have a sign in one of those
is FileZilla don't open that one but
like that's not connect abs aren't doing
any asset II okay I do like care of it
open he has a lot open but none of them
are doing it yeah and I so I can easily
like make myself suffer with the Graham
all my oh I'm so excited about the new
Graham but that's the issue is these
designs are competing with the new
Graham so my new ground is coming I
think sometime in the next couple weeks
and it's got a quad-core Intel processor
8 gen
and it's got
gigs of RAM that's standard now so when
you were competing with last gen designs
like this one that was fine that was
very last interview when you have to
compete with new ones then it becomes a
bit of a problem so I'm not really not
sure what they're trying to do here
in other news AMD is finally making
money what so this was originally this
is way cooler than it seems I know I was
like a consumer you might be like hey I
don't really care man but like no but it
matters that's really important it
matters a lot this is supposed to by Doc
swag on the forum the original article
here is actually from AMD zone site and
check this biz out what on one point six
four billion dollars revenue so you
compare this to last quarter that is a
really hefty outflow uplift that looks
like about 25 percent uplift over last
quarter and a little less than that over
the same quarter the previous year
operating income though is a hundred and
twenty six million dollars gross profit
with a net income so that's excuse me
after expenses of 71 million dollars now
to be clear this is still seven cents
per share so it's not like you know all
of a sudden AMD is gonna be you know
throwing hookers and blow parties at
their headquarters or whatever but hey
this is a really really good thing for
the PC industry in general so they
really write that they beat expectations
Oh what's up the just like negative is
just brackets they don't want to put the
negative symbol no that's normal
brackets yeah oh yeah that's an it's an
accounting thing I don't I don't know
why that's odd but sure but yeah so
operating income was 126 million
compared to an almost 300 million loss a
year ago and net income was 71 million
compared to a net loss of 406 million a
year ago it's amazing they survived as
long as they didn't really use they had
to sell everything sold their fabs you
know they sold their HQ right yeah yeah
like they don't actually own their
headquarter building anymore
they had to like like monopoly style man
yeah they had to mortgage boardwalk and
then somehow climb back yeah is like
really hard to do in monopoly yeah it's
like and in real life yeah so average
sale prices for GPUs went up
significantly yeah I don't know that
cryptocurrency really would have helped
AMD sell the GPUs for much higher so I'm
not really sure where that comes from
but but it Bega has a higher ASP than
their previous flagship Polaris and well
they're not getting the cut from the
average sale price of GPUs going up but
it does mean that stores are like please
give us more yeah what is a good
position to be in so high volumes has
more and this quarter was especially
strong in enterprise embedded and
semi-custom so that would be stuff like
oh I don't know maybe the upcoming Xbox
one X yeah very cool and this is weird
like I actually this our last point in
the notes here was one that I went and I
looked up for myself without actually
knowing that it was already in the notes
but AMD's they beat their earnings
guidance and then their stock did that's
different yeah
like why you mad that earning money I
have no idea yeah I mean while like you
know Bitcoin has gone up by heck yeah
whatever yeah you you have some Bitcoin
I have some Bitcoin yeah yeah yeah I I
expected like I don't know there's
there's the one side of things where
it's like Bitcoin is like the the
Internet video to TV and like blah blah
blah like this is this is gonna like
completely rule the world like all this
like super hardcore crowd and then
there's people that are like uh no yeah
so like until I can buy a grand-slam
breakfast at Denny's with Bitcoin once
it gets to that point that will be
insane yeah and then it's like because
it has staying power in very weird raise
right now but also have some big issues
like that fork it's a potentially like
it's intense it's a scary thing cuz it's
a hobbyist thing right now like normal
people can't be running around dealing
with oh like you know oh you know my
currency my currency is uh you know it's
this this is gonna this is gonna like
fork and then instead of $50 I'm gonna
have $25 and $25 you know one thing one
thing that's and then and then one of
them might go up and one of them might
go down so I have to like make I have to
be following the news I have to make a
bet on which one I think is gonna be the
one that goes up but then there's also
also huge benefits that are happening
for it we're like smartphones now
carrying your standard credit card and
being able to tap to pay yes
is it naturally extremely easy and
already happening for Bitcoin right so
like the the normal financial
institutions going like hey we want to
modernize and do this thing already
works for Bitcoin so it's not weird for
consumers to switch to that so like
there's I don't know it's a very weird
space it's really fun to follow that's
why I have some and
I don't have some Bitcoin as in like a
few whole Bitcoin I have like some NOK
one yeah well now that they're worth
like almost six thousand US dollars who
knows that could be a lot of money yeah
I just yeah like I don't have a huge
amount in it I just have a little bit
I'm I mostly like playing with I'm doing
it for fun right yeah I'm mostly doing
it for fun
I've made money which is great but
whatnot but you also have to like you
have to think of it right now as
gambling pretty much that's pretty much
what it is I basically see it as
spending money on a really expensive
hobby yeah yeah and if you do it for
look I don't personally gamble at all
yeah I don't need I have never put a
quarter in a slot machine I have never
walked up to a buff Jack to put two
quarters in his Lobby okay
cuz they were American quarters I didn't
know what to do with them so I don't
gamble hide it illegally cut underage
that doesn't mean that you can't gamble
responsibly you know you if it's fun for
you to get the rush of playing the game
and you go look the experience of being
in the casino and having people around
who are also gamblers whatever that
works here yeah that Gamble's in a very
healthy manner
yeah and is that has a $500 value to me
and if I lose it all then I got my $500
worth and if I win something
then I'll celebrate and I'll go buy a
nice dinner you can gamble responsibly
and as long as you approach Bitcoin in
that manner I think that you could not
totally screw yourself so here's my $500
and I'm gonna make a hobby out of
following the news and now I've got some
skin in the game so it's kind of like
it's kind of like betting with your
friends on a sports game yeah and like
one thing that you can do is like oh you
see it do something trendy and you're
like okay I can cash out here for a
certain amount I'm excited that it's
gonna go up or it's it's gonna maybe go
down for a second and I'll buy and then
I'll buy a little bit more with the
money that I cashed out with and then
it'll go back up so now I just like
increased my own investment off my own
investment so you can do fun things like
that so you're not even putting more
money in it just takes a little bit more
work and there's like transaction cost
you have to factor that it like it's
it's just kind of a fun thing to follow
and pay attention to Jake got really
into it I was hanging out with Jake I'm
like Kay well
if we're gonna talk about this all time
anyways I might as well just and then
it's been fun I actually have been I've
been enjoying it it's cool
speaking of enjoying things I enjoy
telling you guys about freshmen so fresh
books is the way to manage the real job
that you do and the sort of for now real
money that you make fresh books is the
small business accounting software for
freelancers and small business owners
it's built for the way you work and it
is simple so you don't have to have a
degree from the university of smart-arse
to quote one of my favorite online
creators of all time to just manage your
freaking finances for your business you
can actually just do your plumbing job
or your general contracting or teach
Gant's lessons out of your garage and
get home at the end of the day and not
be like fighting with complicated
software it lets you create and send
professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds set up online payments
in just a couple of clicks and get paid
up to four days faster and even see when
your client has seen your invoice to put
an end to the guessing games
the FreshBooks platform works on the PC
on a Mac on mobile you've got the full
capabilities of the platform on your
Android or iOS device and you can try it
out for free over at FreshBooks comm
slash when I know I had different
talking points in their home slash win
and you can claim your free trial
they're just put Linus tech tips in the
how did you hear about us section next
up we've got synergy so do you have the
supremely first world problem of having
too many computers Oh No
and too many keyboards and mice plugged
into them oh wow I mean it's
legitimately a problem like a lot of
people have very good reasons for having
multiple computers yeah maybe you prefer
to do your development in a Linux
environment or an OS 10 environment but
you want a game on your Windows computer
well synergy lets you use just one
keyboard or mouse across all those
devices it is cross-platform you just
drag your mouse on to the other screen
you just set it all up within the
software they've got just like this grid
you set up where all your screens are
and
you can even do more than just switch
which one you're using you can drag and
drop files between the computers you can
share the clipboard between the
computers you can set up hotkeys and
much more the basic option does not
include encryption while the pro one
includes encryption for the data being
passed between the computers so you can
use our link in the video description to
save 50% on synergy and sorry go ahead
someone said dual boot bro Wow
the point is that you can use both of
them at the same time beyond if you want
to check out a retro video look up what
would it be called Luke's mineral oil PC
yeah I'm pretty sure is that I don't
know where's Club Oh a slick soil cooled
PC yeah drop it in the chat if you check
that out I have two keyboards - mice -
monitors - pcs because if everything
split up and if I had realized this was
a thing back then that would have been
really helpful yeah and I mean another
perfect example is if you have something
like a render box
yeah render box like my main one that I
tell people is if you have a laptop that
used for work yeah you can take it home
dock it when you get home and then go
back and forth 13-3 because you could
drag and drop files across them
everything it's wonderful and the
docking process is as simple as putting
it down next to your computer yeah and
maybe plugging in power if you don't
want it - yeah but that has nothing that
synergy nothing to do with the keyboard
and mouse yeah so pretty cool I'm
bringing us - whoa we've got a new
sponsor madrenas coffee
whoa look at all this there's a lot
wow these guys must have sent over like

is it 40% off but you get this awesome
giveaway opportunity yes speaking of
things that are awesome
this is supposed to by Fucci on the
forum EA has shut down the revive
network that's actually not awesome at
all no no actually this is kind of trash
oh so you know how the gaming community
went through this whole thing we're
dedicated servers started disappearing
you know dedicated server software that
came with the game that you could run
and set up your own private server that
other people could join those started
disappearing in favor of the publisher
actually running their own servers that
everybody would connect to and the
argument for this was that oh we are
simplifying the process and we are
increasing the general quality of
service for gamers and we are creating a
more consistent experience with
consistent rules and map rotations and
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
whatever the matchmaking is it's a big
argument that's being made for it um but
the problem that a lot of the advocates
for private servers brought up was that
well hold on a second like realistically
you know EA is not gonna want to run you
know okay what would be an example of ok
so let's say battlefield 2 EA it's not
gonna run a wanton want to run
battlefield 2 servers when there's like
you know maybe a few hundred people left
playing the game you know so this is a
thing that you're gonna pay for you're
gonna buy this game and then at some
point in the future like an MMO it's
just gonna expire because it's not
worthwhile for EA to keep running this
stuff and keep maintaining it and you're
just not gonna be able to play
multiplayer anymore so specifically
they're looking at battlefield 2
battlefield
1:42 in battlefield heroes I really
liked battlefield 2 so really one of the
big problems was that games by used to
run some of these multiplayer
experiences and when gamespy disappeared
in 2014
revive the revive Network sort of rose
from the ashes as an unlicensed and
unauthorized way of making these games
playable online free of charge so EA had
originally planned to make the older
games playable at the time but reverse
the decision as a result of significant
technical hurdles which basically I
think made the revive guys think that
they were pretty much good to go
but they just posted the following
statement we will get right to the point
Electronic Arts his legal team has
contacted us and nicely asked us to stop
distributing and using their
intellectual property as diehard fans of
the franchise we will respect these
stipulations and they've been doing this
for three and a half years now so
they've invested not an insignificant
amount of their time and effort into
making these gaming experiences still
available you know I wonder if FA
forever is still around so that's
another perfect example of of a
community-driven project to to bring
multiplayer back to a game that had been
abandoned it looks like these guys are
still up so this is for supreme
commander Forge for a while this is a
little funky
because grants of FA forever is actually
very good by the way I'd played it for a
little bit I've been trying to figure
out this pretty much the whole time it
says we must ask that you stop throwing
down ammo crates this is apparently a
quote seems a little informal but it's
apparently a quote we must ask that you
stop throwing down ammo crates and other
more legal stylized terms
please stop distributing copies of our
game clients and using our trademarks
logos and artwork on your sites it
actually has nothing to do with running
the forums and this has pointed out
somewhere else in a comment which made
me realize that I'm not the only person
that noticed this revive doesn't seem to
be reacting that way so I'm wondering if
there was more in the statement from EA
because it's a very short statement yeah
so maybe we didn't get the whole thing
but basically all they're saying is
make it so you can download our clients
I'm sure people can find another way
around yeah and don't use our artwork
and logos but like I'm sure you can find
ways around that although it might be a
little bit of an issue where's the
where's the thing just trademark that
might be a bit of an issue because
saying battlefield 2 on the site might
be a problem
yeah well yeah it is a bigger statement
overall yeah it's not that much bigger
than actually yeah there's not much else
more here yeah yeah so honestly this is
one of those like crappy legal things
where at the end of the day totally get
why they have to do this okay that hold
on a second kid altra 13 I should just
ban you from the chat
let the old online games die and buy new
ones what's wrong with that I'm now
hopefully you're just trolling I hope
you're just trolling but yeah I don't
know no it's probably it's probably fine
no one could be that stupid
so it should be okay okay yeah we'll
just leave it probably trolling and I
can respect trolling more than I can run
back to thinking that yeah they're our
sponsor today yeah why are you just
drinking on camera how much did they
send I've seen everybody drinking this
stuff drinking what a nice refreshing
madrenas you're off-camera yeah you're
too tall
now you're behind the mic everyone gets
it it's okay
oh that was awesome anyway so that sucks
a lot yeah I like I totally get why it's
happening and they're like actually
right today but they're only right today
because they were wrong years ago and
they wasted a lot of vibe yeah they
didn't provide server software for
people to set up their own private
server and instead of doing it this way
they could have found some legal way to
sanction these kind of things yeah well
what they would have to do is they would
have to release the server software but
yeah because it contains all this
matchmaking crap and all of this other
stuff that a traditional game server
wouldn't have it probably contains a lot
of IP that they are actually still using
today and proprietary thanks fair so
they actually like can't do anything now
they have to protect the trademark
otherwise they risk not being able to
defend it in the future and they can't
release the server code so what like
there's got to be another way to do
again they don't specify that they can't
run the servers right they don't want
the trademark being used in what the
logos being used they don't want them to
distribute copies of the game you can
stop distributing copies of the game
distributing okay disk you know
distributing copies of our game clients
yeah so they can stop doing that okay
now Apple can find a way to get a copy
of the game so let's let if they're
going as far as finding this site I'm
sure they'll find a way to download a
like non cracked version of battlefield
- I still have a battlefield 2 key
somewhere yeah never actually played
that I'm sure there are websites on the
internet where you can find the like ISO
file for an uncracked battlefield - in
other news the nvidia gtx 1070 TI looks
to be taking the fight Thank You Ars
Technica - RX Vega 56 at 450 bucks specs
of this thing actually look pretty good
24 32 CUDA cores 8 gigs of gddr5 so it's
the cheaper gddr5 not due to the
five X 256 gigabytes a second memory
bandwidth okay cool and it is yes
overclockable so you will see custom
designs coming from partners like a soos
so yeah the the rumor and the sigh I'm
happy we very clearly pointed out as
being a rumor of this being not
overclockable was not true
yeah yeah that was made very clear in
the press release yeah there's some
funky stuff going on though from source
Ryan show Ryan Ryan shroud sigh here's
our source it told us stood by for pc
perspective sorry man yeah Ryan shroud
there's some funky stuff going on
apparently partners are not allowed to
bin their GPUs but off the record some
board partners assure that they will be
banning GPUs
so that's gonna be interesting the other
rumor is that partner cards will not be
overclocked out-of-the-box yeah so we'll
be up to the end-user to overclock it so
what this looks like to me is Nvidia
making if all this is true is Nvidia
making an effort to avoid cannibalizing
1080 I guess because this this card
spans being able to overclock above it
like like this thing's got 500 more cuda
cores than the GTX 770 this is a much
much fatter GPU the drastic leader it's
thick you know thick that's what the
kids say right thi see see ya
I'm do you do they spell it or is it
just implied thick know they say thick
but if you're typing it out like through
a text message or something is thic see
okay why I don't know
too old okay so this was supposed to be
hawk on the forum the original article
is from tweet town intel has announced
their next-gen op teen SSD the 900p and
i'm gonna pee myself because this thing
is the biggest deal to happen to SSDs
since like the X 25m potentially I
haven't actually tested it myself I
haven't actually used one but right now
the you to form factor so this guy right
here is available at 280 gigs
you and the add-in card yeah Intel has
not abandoned it
apparently no one else is supporting it
but Intel's like yep nope we're doing
this because I guess it lets them reuse
their server designs and the ports
aren't going away on high-end boards
there's a there and it it pulls it off
the board yeah
MDOT two in a PCIe there's fixed on the
board being able to have way more stuff
pulling off the board is also good and
this adding card is available at 280 and
480 gig capacity points it looks good
boy it looks pretty good like it doesn't
have the really sick skull well yeah
I've always been into that the digitized
skull was super cool the skull trails
call but like it looks sharp I like the
I like the black but like hopefully the
back of it isn't all like scratched up
like that one SSD yeah oh my god nothing
looks so good
you know how much debate there would be
at a company as corporate as Intel about
using something like this on their
branding because like you got to
remember to like North American culture
yeah skulls and flames cool whereas like
I'm pretty sure that in at least some
parts of Asia it's this is like putting
a big bad omen on your product and it's
like basically like looks so cool though
and it's weird because I don't even
generally like skulls like remember
remember when we were not not I wouldn't
say growing up but like teens there was
all the like people had there was a
clothing with skulls on it was like
totally in fashion you know what I think
I was a little older than you probably
yeah but not by the time I was like you
know late teens early we had bomb
equipment and no fear yeah no I had that
too but remember no fear that's still
around I don't think so i I there's a
picture of me wearing a no fear like
mesh shirt yeah terrible it's you
remember those but like slightly
see-through and there's only slightly
seat there for like here up cuz legs
were awful don't show the nipple but
gotta have that see-through it was
awesome man
oh man Oh way no fears still around sort
of actually I don't know if that's a
stylized the same
I miss my so I used to have a no fear
hat it was black and it had the eyes on
the snappa no I don't have my know if
your hat anymore I loved my know if your
hat when didn't have the eyes here and
then it was no fear on the back when did
you stop having them oh no I have my
stupid gecko hat that's probably the one
you're thinking no no I know that hat
when did you stop having that before I
met you
oh yeah a long time ago well I've seen a
picture isn't he yeah there's not much
no fear no fear was huge but at one
point I'm like probably I'm gonna guess
I was in like grade 10 skulls were like
totally a thing right just like black
fabric with white skulls on it was still
a thing and I was always like that's so
stupid it looks you're not edgy it looks
dumb I don't know what you're doing
you're not edgy like it way just wasn't
alternate burn you know what you're not
you're trying which automatically means
your base it doesn't work yeah but like
that looks at the skull trail skull
though has always looked sick because
they found like a classy way to put a
skull on something which I don't know I
thought it was really cool all right
last topic for today we got to talk
about this poster by blue chinchilla
eating Doritos on the forum original
article here is actually from the
Vancouver Sun Amazon wants to let the
delivery person unlock your front door
and go inside your home to the service
is called how can you call this a
service it's called Amazon key and
incorporates a smart lock give Amazon a
key to your house because wolf knows
what what people are gonna do man people
are absolutely gonna do it cuz like
honestly this is one of those things
where you're basically just you're
trying to get Amazon drivers to get to
get narrow do all applicants to become
Amazon delivery drivers and like if they
were anywhere near I like I'm afraid to
be giving them ideas because by and
large as far as I can tell most thieves
aren't that brilliant but like
if they have a brain on their shoulders
at all then what they would do is they
would find the squeaky cleanest one who
is the driver and he just cases what yep
I've heard it before too people are
absolutely gonna do this someone
internally is apparently planning to
sign up for this yeah and exactly what
you're saying the drivers gonna case the
house yeah but if there's anything
valuable in there yeah I figure out
where the security cameras are what type
of alarm system they're using what their
camera setup is everything and then
leave and then someone else and then
create a list because they're gonna be
going around to like many many houses
every day so they would just get back in
their car pull up a little Google sheet
on their phone be like a or B or C the
date they were there like the last date
anyone from Amazon was there to make it
a little bit harder to put two and two
together and then like six months down
the road you're gonna get hit and
they'll know exactly what you have and
exactly where it is so they'll be in out
gone and have all your most valuable
things get freaking out this is like
actually the stupidest thing of all
looks great too you know it's gonna
happen because oh hold that thought yeah
because there's another big problem too
they don't even need to see where your
stuff is
it doesn't matter they know what you
have they know what they don't even need
to know that they just need to know what
kind of stuff you have yeah because if
you're the kind of person who just like
because they're not gonna be able to
just like wander around in your house
cuz I'm sure the smart lock if they have
again if they have a brain on their
shoulders well a camera turns on when
they end yes exactly
okay cool so I hadn't actually read that
far into it but I would certainly hope
that there's a cat yeah they see you on
they're not wandering around in your
house then you have recordings of every
time they visit but if they stand in the
front hallway and they see you know
nothing but like a you know dirty old
dog bed and like some you know soiled
newspapers and you literally ordered
like a case of Kraft Dinner then you're
you're a see you know or you're a D not
worth hitting but if you're ordering
like ball or stuff from Amazon and you
got like a nice home
you got to be stupid if you think that
you're not getting hit you know what I'm
really excited for yeah
Amazon key enabled apartment buildings
okay I may be inconvenient for apartment
wouldn't a well when they build the
structure
yeah they setup key enabled doors and
key enabled cameras for every single
suite I would be less concerned in an
apartment far less yeah so that I'm
actually a lot more okaylet I would be
less concerned to know I'm not entirely
off the hook but I'll be less concerned
yeah because especially if your
apartment has modern features like
needing a fob in order to access a given
floor as long as you've got a camera on
the person that's there the whole time
that they're there then yeah it's far
less of an issue and I was kind of
thinking it would be cool if you had a
double door refrigerator so he came up
to like the side of your house and then
put groceries in the back of your
refrigerator yeah so I can see there
being stuff that it that this kind of
idea would be cool for I have no
interest in randoms coming into my home
though yeah someone in chat Amazon shed
sure yeah yeah so I'd be super don't I
put one of these smart locks on like you
know a dumpster in my you know driveway
yeah okay
fine so there are ways that the tech can
be used but the idea of just letting
someone go into my house and so there
are positive security things about not
leaving a package outside but I don't
think that they were overcoming that by
having someone go into your house yeah
so that's that's where I'm at so there
are brands already signed on to enter
dwellings via Amazon key including Merry
Maids
and the animal caregiver Rover comm man
you know I just this you know this feels
like this feels like to me like I'm
getting left behind the same way I did
when online dating became a thing cuz to
me I was like oh Jeff Bezos became the
richest man in the world today as their
stock price surged
13% to a record high and he owns 81
million shares so he's not worth 90
billion dollars there you go
so I feel like I'm being left behind in
kind of the same way that I was when
online-dating became a thing because to
me like I haven't dated since online
dating didn't have a stigma right around
it yeah like back when I was in high
school media doesn't any no yeah it's no
big no big deal
which is like weird Late Show hosts are
talking about like you know swiping left
and swiping right like it's super cash
now and like celebrities are
legitimately on it yeah um but when I
was in high school it was like oh my god
if a met online you know to go 100
percent valley girl for you guys yeah
and it was good you did good for me I'm
looking at this is kind of the same
thing like I'm instead of but instead of
meeting someone random at a at a you
know away from my home and my stuff and
like my privacy location I am like I'd
like a restaurant or something I am
bringing randoms into my house now when
I hire a babysitter your gardening
service or whatever I were usually
Yvonne yeah that's fair interviews them
yeah in the same way that if you think
about it you would traditionally meet a
dating partner by an interview process
like an in person of sorts yeah
handshake no but but you get what I mean
it is though to a certain degree yeah
but we're moving away from that to like
sort of you know finding your finding
your maid or your or your dating partner
by you know flipping through the
available options and kind of going oh
that one's got good reviews on you know
made swipe made swipe calm already I'm
sure it's probably a thing Oh
interesting
when I was a cop you can't be available
because you know that's just gonna turn
into a fetish site like immediately it's
available
what made swipe dot-com it's only 15
bucks Canadian dollars no way wholly
made swipe com whoever buys that don't
just buy it and sit on it buy it and
