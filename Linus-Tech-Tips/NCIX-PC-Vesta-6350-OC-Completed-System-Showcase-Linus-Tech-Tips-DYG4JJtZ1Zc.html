the crazy Russian laboratory here at
NCIX so I had a few guys comment on my
video where i showed the vesta 6350 OC
on the test bench and the comment was
well if you guys are validating your
overclock and you know validating your
hardware configurations on a test bench
that's not very representative of a
real-world scenario so i just wanted to
make sure that you guys see that once
it's done on the test bench it then goes
into the chassis that the system will
actually be using in this case the 600t
special edition white case and i'm going
to just try not to pull on those cables
too hard so you guys have probably seen
this I've done videos about it in the
past gorgeous face lots of cooling the
whole front of it is mesh goes inside
there we set the fan controller too low
we get everything configured exactly the
way it'll be for the end user and then
we validate it again over the course of
48 hours now what about a worst-case
scenario we do that too so for this
particular system we actually tested it
once with two triple slot Radeon 69 70 s
these are the Asus directcu two cards so
the triple slot which means they're
right close together and it passed a
48-hour burnin even with those however
for the sake of this video I wanted to
show you guys something that's a little
bit more representative of what most
users will configure the system with so
let's go ahead and open it up i'm just
going to outline the the specs one more
time here so we've got 16 gigs of ram
we've got a 2600 k overclock to 4
gigahertz you can actually choose
whether you want to 69 70 or a gtx 570
is your default video card option with
this case the hx750 wat is fully capable
of powering two of either of those cards
so you can run a dual graphics
configuration remember this is LGA 1155
so triple graphics configurations aren't
really an option because of the limited
pci express lanes that are controlled by
the cpu so if you do want a three-way
configuration so you know if you're
saying oh you know the power supply is
not big enough if you want to put in
three graphics cards you shouldn't be
doing
anyway if you want a three-way graphics
card configuration go with the next 79
platform and then you can you know throw
in more RAM and do more you know a six
core processor and all that kind of
stuff anyway that stuff's not available
on LGA 1155 so we're using an H 84
cooling and then we've got a force 3 120
gig I wish I could move this but the
actually here come on come over and have
a look over here so we've got a force 3
120 gig SSD is the boot drive that's a
one terabyte storage Drive I mean the
hard drive shortage is still killing
those hard drive prices although they
are starting to come down now and then
in here we have custom white lighting to
match the white case so I'm going to go
ahead and put the side panel back on to
give you guys a closer look at what it's
going to look like there we go yeah I
want you to get this angle from down
here see that that looks awesome so
there's a white LED fan there is the
white case itself and then we've got the
two white LED strips that give it just a
fantastic overall look inside so if you
buy one of these systems this is pretty
much exactly what it's going to look
like I mean short of you know maybe if
you add another storage hard drive you
might have another say to cable running
over there but I think that's pretty
much it so thanks for checking out this
showcase of the Vesta 6350 and don't
forget if you want to see one of these
in person you can actually check it out
at our Vancouver retail store or at our
Aberdeen mall location enrichment so
