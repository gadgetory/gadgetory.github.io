brought to you by phantom glass visit
store phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX alright guys welcome to the
DJI booth where we're checking out the
DJI inspire 1
this device is a 3 axis gimbal mounted
to a drone that can travel at 60 miles
an hour and up to the height legal
height of 400 feet we'll get back to the
flying part of the drone in a minute but
for now the camera on this unit is its
own unique beast with 12 megapixels that
can record 4k video at 24 to 30 fps and
1080p video at 24 to 60 fps it has a 1/2
point 5-inch CMOS sensor and a 94 degree
wide angle lens within fixed f-stop of
2.8 all sitting on a 3 axis 360 degree
rotating gimbal which should produce
some amazing results I've been told that
the gimbal can even hold the camera
steady for long enough to take solid
long exposure photos it also is possible
to swap out the camera but please note
there are no currently other available
cameras that are compatible with this
device the drones carbon-fiber arms and
deployable landing gear able to move out
of the way from the camera easily while
in the air to ensure beautiful
unobstructed shots the drone will keep
itself in place through the use of GPS
and a visual positioning system mounted
on the bottom of the unit being a
lightweight drone it has a maximum
flight time of 18 minutes it also has a
very impressive communication range of 2
kilometers
thanks to DJ eyes proprietary light
bridge 2.4 gigahertz communication
technology the app is pretty awesome as
well allowing for dual operator control
on for one person to control the drone
and the other to control the camera the
app also features auto takeoff in Auto
land with a dynamic home point for
return home functionality based on the
location of the controller it also
displays live map radar and telemetry
data amongst other details to keep you
informed
keep in mind this is a very expensive
unit coming in at two thousand eight
hundred and ninety dollars DJI doesn't
even recommend it for amateur drone
operators but an experienced operator
could achieve beautiful aerials for much
less than many other drones on the
market alright guys thank you for
