now to learn more welcome to my unboxing
and overview including some performance
numbers of gigabytes geforce gtx 780 a
win for sedition overclocked card much
like other gtx 780 s this has a 384 bit
memory bus it has three gigs of ram it
has a gk110 GPU which means in terms of
gaming performance this thing is pretty
much almost as ballin as it gets
it only falls behind the gtx titan in
terms of performance and it's really not
by that much unless you really need the
6 gigs of iran that you'll find on a gtx
titan inside the box we find a little
shiny gigabyte logo covering up the card
itself now the first time I saw the gtx
780 win force was actually at Computex
and gigabyte had an extreme while
there's no accessories in here
interesting and gigabyte had an
extremely impressive demo of their new
redesigned windforce cooler running that
basically showed that it's about as
butt-kicking as possible while
maintaining a dual slot form factor so
this is a trend that we've seen even a
soos backing away from the triple slot
form factors that they've had on
previous direct cu2 cards well gigabyte
has gone ahead and done dual slot as
well so they are claiming up to 450
watts of heat dissipation with the
redesigned windforce cooler so they're
using a triple fan layout in order to
achieve that as well as a combination of
8 millimeter and 6 millimeter heat pipes
that you can see actually extend away
from here I'll try to get you guys a
better angle here so you can check that
out maybe we'll do this b-roll but that
go away from the GPU itself and then
carry it out into two slightly different
aluminum thin arrays and what's
different about them is this this one
here at the back of the card has no
metal backing so it's a straight path
this fan and then the right-hand side of
this fan are blowing directly down onto
the PCB in a way that is extremely
positive because this is right right
here where the vrm is so that's where
voltage is converted from the 12-volt
power that comes in at the back of the
card in those two'll from those dual
eight pin PCI Express connectors
converts that into something that the
GPU and the memory and the other
components on board can use these
components are often the hottest running
part of a graphics card even including
the GPU so having direct active cooling
over top of them is excellent now for
the rest of the card check out over here
what gigabites done is they've used a
sort of like a uni sink type design so
they've used a large full cover design
that is able to make direct contact with
not only the GPU but also the RAM and
then they've put what they're calling
their triangle cooler concept on here
and what this does is a couple of things
so it redirects the airflow so air flow
from these two fans here is still going
down towards the card but because
there's direct contact between the
heatsink and the components underneath
the air doesn't pass right through so
what happens is they're using this
triangle shape which is kind of shaped
like this from the side if you guys can
kind of imagine that to direct airflow
down towards the PCI Express slot this
should help with motherboard cooling a
little bit as well as up here away from
the card itself now you can see at the
back of this card we're going to find
our i/o so we've got two DVI ports
DisplayPort and HDMI so that supports up
to Nvidia 3d vision surround with three
displays plus an auxiliary display as
well as some ventilation that's not
going to be exhausting a whole lot of
air with this cooler design this cooler
design is going to dissipate the air
inside your case so you're gonna want to
make sure that you have adequate case
cooling in order to take care of that
like all gk110 GPUs that use this PCI
Express 3.0 16 X at the bottom of the
card and then on the back we find that
it is I'm not a huge departure from the
reference PCB meaning that it is a bit
of a chore to remove the stock cooler
although you could do it with four looks
like about seven or eight screw removals
so if you did want to custom cool this
card whether it's with water cooling or
some kind of
aftermarket cooler you could do that but
I can't really say that I recommend that
given that gigabyte already provides an
outstanding cooler on it now in terms of
overclocking performance we put it
head-to-head against a reference card in
order to find out well okay it comes
with a higher stock clock by over a
hundred megahertz on boost so this is a
one gigahertz card when it's running at
its boost clocks part of this is because
of gigabytes aggressive BIOS tuning and
part of it is because of the better
cooler that it has them stock verse well
I shouldn't say better because the
reference cooler is really sexy looking
but this one is going to provide better
cooling and so what we did is we took
them and we put them head-to-head in
order to find out okay so yeah it's you
know it's quiet it looks great blob of
all that stuff but does it actually
perform better and when we overclock the
card we did get slightly better
performance as you can see in some of
the benchmark graphs that I'm going to
be overlaying here
however it's not an enormous huge
difference or anything like that but if
you're not comfortable overclocking it
does come with a significantly higher
stock clock as well thank you for
checking out my unboxing and overview
slash review of the gigabyte gtx 780 win
force graphics card don't forget to
subscribe for more unboxings like this
don't forget to leave a comment under
the video tell me what you think is the
gtx 780 the go-to card these days for
very high performance gaming Titan costs
so much more in 770 doesn't perform
nearly as well so it's kind of starting
to look that way
and if so what do you think of gigabytes
offering like the video if you liked it
dislike if you disliked it I don't care
and don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
