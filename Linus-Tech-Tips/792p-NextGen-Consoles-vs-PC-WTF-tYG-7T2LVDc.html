up because we're about to go on one hell
of a high-definition ride at 792p with
its power loss protection affordability
and performance the SP 924 may data
makes upgrading to an SSD remarkably
safe and simple we're going to try and
quantify just how not next-gen the
next-gen consoles are we're going to do
this by taking a test bench and figure
out exactly how much graphics horsepower
is needed to deliver the console grade
experience and watchdogs versus how much
raw power it would need to deliver a PC
grade experience basically high
resolutions and much higher frame rates
we know that our test bench is overkill
and not really comparable to a console
but we chose these parts in our
experiment to remove potential
bottlenecks and focus on our funky
thought experiment in terms of GPU clock
speeds an extremely important factor for
gaming bear in mind that by removing
these bottlenecks we're keeping the
tests as fair as possible and if
anything our lower graphics
configuration gets an advantage from the
OPC PU and RAM but how do you remove as
many variables as possible and bring
everything down to GPU clock speed well
by strapping a GTX 480 to it I chose a
GTX 480 because of its ability to under
clock and overclock quite well giving it
a wide range of possible performance
levels things to note are the Xbox one
and ps4 while closer to typical PC
architecture than any console generation
before are still actually quite
different we're also not covering power
consumption and we're running everything
on high settings all the time we expect
the devs want that experience on any
given platform as a baseline so changing
it between runs which is add more
variables and again we're just focusing
on GPU clock speed the lowest clock
speed I could get on my GTX 480 was 405
and this allowed me to run the game at
792p and about 32 to 33 fps
yeah I actually couldn't underclock my
five-year-old GPU to be as slow as a
next-gen console pc masterrace problems
if we don't nerf our five-year-old GPU
quite so hard we can get pretty easily
to 1080p 30fps but 60fps is a completely
different ballgame
a teepee 60fps wasn't going to happen on
our poor old 480 but good ol awkward
792p was able to run at 60fps if I crank
to this GPU clock speed up to eight
hundred and seventy five megahertz so
yeah it would be soft fps and resolution
are numbers and so is clock speed and
those so called next-gen consoles should
have had a lot more of all three again
guys I can't stress enough these are
very different architectures and we're
only interested in seeing how much more
raw power the GPU of a platform that can
run at 792p 30fps
would need to run at 1080p 30fps and
792p 60fps and there's interesting to
see how borderline these next-gen
consoles actually are because going from
7.92 p to 1080p only required about 40%
more raw power while doubling the FPS
required more than double that raw power
this is bad news for gamers who think
they're going to get 60 FPS beautifully
rendered games this gen because they're
not even close but this was just a
coking dirty thought experiment and
while it does show a representation of
the power needed to get these consoles
up to speed calling it a perfect
representation of the competitive
landscape maybe a bit of a stretch also
for the console guys there are things
coming down the line like ms cloud for
Xbox one and DirectX 12 for next gen
consoles in general that may help them
but after looking at the board's needed
for them to catch up I think it's
possibly going to need a little bit more
than just that alright guys that was
just kind of some food for thought I
