the SteelSeries 5hv to USB so this is
their highest end headset currently it
comes with all the bells and whistles of
any of their headsets including a USB
sound card now SteelSeries is a gaming
company they specialize in gaming
peripherals so this is targeted at
gamers they're saying this headset is
optimized to give you the best possible
sound quality for gaming specific
applications and actually I should
mention this one of the reasons that
they encourage users to get these USB
sound cards is it means that whether
you're playing on your own machine or on
like a tournament land machine where
everyone's using like a standardized
computer so that no one has an unfair
advantage it retains all of your
settings and gives you the same audio
quality actually they're mice all of
their current mice feature similar
features where as soon as you plug it in
it retains all of your settings and you
don't have to you know tweak the
sensitivity within windows or anything
like that so it'll operate the way you
want it to regardless of which computer
it's plugged into so that's kind of a
cool feature and an interesting selling
point of this particular headset so
let's have a look at the accessory
package comes in a little zip tied
plastic baggie here that includes a cord
and some other stuff okay so first of
all steal serious professional gaming
gear this is a little catalog oh it also
includes a SteelSeries sticker
okay so tu-tu-tu-tu-tu us-uk warning
don't turn your headphones up to love
okay awesome and here is a little
brochure of all of their different
gaming products now this is one of the
only sort of v2 products in their in
their product line the other one they
have is the new Siberia v2 and these are
both gonna be pretty similar in terms of
quality but the 5 HP 2 does have a
couple things over the Siberia v2 okay
here's your USB soundcard
you plug that into a USB port and it has
two things on it it has a headphone jack
and a mic jack okay that's pretty
straightforward and then oh we have the
driver disc for the USB
card you should definitely be going to
steal syriza's website and downloading
the latest drivers but I never recommend
using a driver disk okay so I have
another little zip tie here I'm going to
try and get this off okay so we have an
inline volume control it feels quite
sturdy actually I like the build quality
of this and then the mic well this is
kind of cool it can be set to high low
or off okay you got a little setting
there and then you have a pretty durable
feeling metal clip I like to see a metal
clip I mean it's little things like that
that distinguish something like the 5hv
to from a less expensive headset okay
you've got a nice long braided cable and
it terminates in a headphone output and
a mic input just like you see on the USB
soundcard so this is how its intended to
be used but just because it's a USB
headset doesn't mean you can't use it
with a regular analog output and input
okay so let's get down to the headset
itself I'm just taking the zip ties off
the back here so that I can actually
remove it from there plastic packaging
okay so the ear cups have huge padding
on them you can see the padding here is
really soft and it's actually a like
it's like almost as thick as the
headphone itself so these are extremely
comfortable I've actually used these
before in the past but I never did an
unboxing on them and the way they sit on
your ear is not they don't wash it down
what they do is they sit kind of lightly
and once you've used them for an
extended period of time they will start
to mold to your head and that's a mark
of any good headset they're quite open
sounding actually and you can tell from
the vents on the sides as well as the
type of foam they're using on the ear
pads so they're not gonna isolate sound
much from the outside and they're also
not going to isolate what you're
listening to from the people around you
one cool feature of the 5hv 2 is
actually that you can disassemble it
check this out so you can actually
release these clips on the inside and
you can take the whole head set apart
for easy transportation if you're
throwing it in a bag or whatever else
like that you can see the contacts are
actually quite durable they're cool well
they seem to be gold-plated they might
not be though either way they make
really good contact in there
you're not gonna have to worry about
those wearing out the last feature of
the 585 hv2 is a pretty distinctive
SteelSeries feature and that is a
retractable mic that sits up in one of
the ear cups so that means you can
actually use them as headphones unlike a
lot of gaming headsets where you have
like this huge mic hanging up the side
of it and you look like a total tool if
you were to try and listen to music on
them in public anyway thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the
SteelSeries 5 hv2
