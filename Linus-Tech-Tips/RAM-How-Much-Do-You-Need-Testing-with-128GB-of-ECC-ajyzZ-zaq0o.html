computer so many people ask the question
and the only answer they can get from
the in the know techies and I mean we've
even done it here before is usually well
how much are you planning to use yeah
that much which is only useful if you
know how much your workload requires for
gamers it's relatively simple there's a
number on the back of the box excuse me
I digital information page cuz physical
media but for content creators and our
main focus is going to be on Adobe
Creative Cloud because that's what we
use here between Adobe's own system
requirements and whitepapers and the
numerous professionals on the message
boards around the web there's no solid
answer all we really hear is you need
multiple fast storage locations more
memory is good faster processors with
more cores are good and video cards with
like speed and memory capacity are good
this has been the ongoing guidance with
seemingly no consideration for recent
technological changes in the shifting
bottlenecks within pcs and workstations
for years so as part of the process of
designing the workstations for our
editors to find the optimal cost to
performance compromise for a given
workload
I asked ed zl-- to run some benchmarks
in Premiere Pro After Effects and
Photoshop all the Creative Cloud 2014
versions to investigate the effect of
more CPU cores more RAM up to 128 gigs
and varying storage solutions now I was
half-expecting scraps of paper with note
scribbled on them so that we could
configure our workstations but what I
actually got was a very detailed summary
with useful charts that will publish
separately on the line this tech tip
site in the link in the video
description for folks who want to read
it but for those of you who prefer
videos well we made a video about it too
so watch on oh and match that subscribe

I'll start by introducing the test bench
its ensel's 12 core Xeon e5 26 97 based
workstation with the same as Zeus x79
deluxe motherboard that we use in all of
our editing rigs - GeForce GTX Titans
for accelerating 3d rendering a cooling
Master 1200 watt modular power supply a
kingston 240 gig SSD and a WD 1 terabyte
velociraptor for storage and normally 64
gigs of HyperX quad channel ram but to
properly investigate the effects of
memory on performance we needed more RAM
so we used 8 16 gig sticks of
intelligent memory ECC Ram huge thanks
to Memphis by the way for providing this
to us for testing giving us a whopping
128 gigs of ram to either allocate 2
programs or use as a ram disk to see if
we could use excess memory in the system
to alleviate storage bottlenecks so our
premier Pro investigation started with
allocating memory to the program via the
Preferences menu and rendering out
projects at 1080p and 4k resolution with
x264 we used x264 because it was better
optimized for multi-core processors
which inherently utilizes more memory
now remember that when we allocate
memory to premier that doesn't mean
that's the amount of RAM in the system
but rather how much of what's in the
system we can afford to allocate purely
to premiere to play with so at 1080p we
found that if you don't want a multi
task on your machine while rendering 8
gigs of system memory is likely to be
fine there was no benefit to more RAM
beyond our lowest tested 6 gig
allocation at 4k though the story
changes somewhat our red project render
times improved by 7% when we went from 6
gigs to 24 gigs of allocated memory
flattening out significantly after that
demonstrating that the conventional
wisdom of more RAM doesn't really help
beyond a certain point continues to hold
true but where that certain
point is will depend on the type of
projects you're working on and we found
that our 4k ProRes renders benefited
from up to 64 gigs of RAM on Windows 8
but not beyond for larger longer
projects like movies you might end up
needing more memory to keep things
running smoothly while editing but
render times still probably won't
benefit much
now since the usefulness of more RAM
falls off a cliff past 64 gigs that left
us with another 64 gigs of RAM to play
around with in the system so we decided
to see if we could utilize a ram disk as
a scratch disk and ok yeah faster
storage here it doesn't actually do much
sort of render times aren't improved but
a separate physical drive for a scratch
disk whether it's RAM or or SSD
especially SSD versus slower hard drives
does improve the overall perceived
system performance with more responsive
playback faster file importing and
faster project opening being some of the
most noticeable benefits moving on to
After Effects our investigation changed
somewhat to include both ran allocation
and CPU core scaling since we couldn't
find much information about either of
these topics Ram allocation and
multiprocessor rendering mode is for a
particularly confusing thing because
Adobe allows anywhere from one gig to 6
gigs with the cabinet being that if you
have too many cores for the amount of
RAM that you're trying to allocate per
core in your system let's say of a
quad-core CPU 16 gigs of ram and you go
and try and allocate 6 gigs per course a
total of 24 gigs derp the program
supposedly simply won't use all of your
course in this case and on top of that
it treats logical processors or
hyper-threaded course the same as
physical ones so finding the balance
here then is key the largest performance
improvement from additional round
allocation was going from one gig per
core to two gigs per core so in theory
then we should ensure that we have at
least 48 gigs of ram for a 12 core
hyper-threaded aftereffects workstation
but beyond that the law of diminishing
returns should hit us pretty hard but
then we noticed an interesting thing
here and that was that even the large 6
gigs per core allocation should have
required a hundred and forty-four gigs
system ran limiting us to 19 of our 24
threats theoretically CPU utilization
still hovered around 99% even in this
case
so maybe hyper-threaded cores really
aren't affecting performance much which
led us to our investigation into CPU
cores and After Effects performance we
tackled this in two different ways first
by using CPU scheduling to isolate our
real course validating our hypothesis
that hyper threading isn't really doing
a whole lot in this case and then by
disabling course manually within the
computer's UEFI BIOS to see how
performance is affected by more actual
physical course
so in that case performance improvements
from having more horses pulling the cart
were immediately noticeable and while
not linear still demonstrated excellent
scaling now you might think then what is
the point of the CPU scheduling setting
then why even bother with it well EDD
zl-- found that reserving CPU course
even though CPU usage by the system
didn't change much prevented After
Effects from being over scheduled and
lagging out the system and will wrap
things up in Photoshop where the
objective was to determine how much
memory we would need for manipulating
and resizing very large images on a
beefy workstation like this one and the
answer is well really not a heck of a
lot while four gigs of ram resulted in
much lower performance than eight or
more beyond eight gigs we didn't observe
much of a difference but bear in mind
that this will greatly depend on the
size of your project and the history
state setting so the project we used
took four point seven five gigs of
memory or scratch disk and you know the
size of the project then of course
greatly affects the memory usage of your
actions so in our case while it's not
something we can easily benchmark we did
find that our SSDs performance was a bit
of a bottleneck while opening projects
are performing certain actions things we
would have assumed adobe would try to do
in memory first rather than relying on
scratch so we did find that creating a
ram discuss the scratch disk could
improve the user experience by forcing
Photoshop to write to around a seven SSD
but ultimately for raw performance it's
just going to come down to how big is
your project and how much of it sits in
memory
so that same old conclusion which I
guess leads us to the rest of the
conclusion in the last few years the
general guidelines lots of processing
cores lots of RAM and fast storage
haven't really changed and they didn't
change but I still hope that this video
for Adobe creators anyway helped to
clarify which of these things might have
a bigger impact on them personally
