do
so I don't know what was funnier about
the cherry factory tour the fact that we
showed up in lederhosen or the fact that
they had preemptively arranged for two
of their of the of the women in their
marketing department to show up in
dirndl in dirndl it was during I'm
probably pronouncing that wrong but
dirndl absolutely fantastic so they were
they were really good sports about the
whole thing I'm sure it was harder to
walk around their workplace dressed like
that than it was for us as strangers to
people would recognize them and they're
walking around like heels and dirndl
yeah at the office and then there with
these two random dudes who have like
very low quality in some cases ripping
all over the place later hoes and oh oh
man yeah my boxers were totally showing
oh definitely by the end of the day so
the first step in the completely
unexpected like I mean everything about
these just felt over-engineered but we
got to see the acoustic chamber that
they use in order to validate not only
the loudness of products but also the
sound signature of products which was
insane and just to make sure that it's
super accurate they have this this very
targeted microphone inside and foot and
a half-ish thick padding on the outside
with this double door system that he had
to climb into well I looked at it I went
well the microphones next to the switch
in this case it was it was an MX RGB
blue switch and I was like well okay but
how do you actually press the button
while having the door closed so not
being a German engineer he assumed that
you climb inside and press it manually
yourself every single time turns out
that wasn't the answer they actually
have a mechanical finger that presses
the switch over and over again for for
for validation but hey whatever my
solution would have worked to a
technical yet so it's not just for
validating that as they make running
changes and improvements to Cherry MX
that the sound signature stays the same
but they do use it for that it's also
for certifying keyboards to be low noise
enough to to qualify for Blue Angel
certification which is like a German
government thing where if you want to
sell something to the German government
it has to pass the Blue Angels sort of
so if the question was
who cares if you have a 20 decibel noise
floor acoustic chamber for keyboards the
answer is someone the next stop in the
tour was probably my my favorite part
the environmental chamber so they have
this whole hallway of machines that
essentially torture test keyboards from
really torture tests they've had a new
product in one of them that was going
through a cycle of temperature and
humidity changes just to validate that
in storage it wouldn't be broken by any
of four mentioned temperatures and and
conditions and so these things are
capable of going anywhere from minus 40
all the way up to plus a hundred and
eighty degrees so why would that ever
matter apparently see Freight is a big
deal because if you're if your car or
container is at the top of the ship and
it's under the Sun for a very long time
that that inner area within the metal is
going to get really hot kinds of things
you don't think of and then the the
chambers can also handle anywhere from
10 percent relative humidity all the way
up to 98 percent relative humidity so of
course they they loaded one up at minus
25 degrees through one of their one of
the testers that they use to validate
their 50 million keystroke cycles which
doesn't just kind of tap it it hammers
pretty hard
hammers pretty hard and then they
cranked up the humidity in it so we
could get this awesome footage of one of
their testers running on what switches
were they were the MX blacks I think so
I think they were MX blacks of just this
thing being hammered at in the frost and
the cold absolutely saying the craziest
machine in my opinion was the
temperature shock machine so it goes
from I believe it was 70 degrees the
test that they were running it could be
more dressing this but the test that
they're running at the point in time was
70 degrees Celsius in the chamber up top
and then there would be an elevator that
took five seconds which would bring it
down into a separate chamber down below
which was negative 20 degrees and it had
to be able to not like crack and yeah
not have the solder just yeah fail just
completely live up which is pretty
intense actually so in the next room we
found
most expensive piece of equipment on
this entire trip that I almost broke it
has a joystick and he went a little bit
arcade machine on it but it was I was
driving that thing so if you've ever
seen like a really big warehouse and you
see that crane that's on the big rail
the top that can move pretty much
wherever it wants basically like that
pretty much what it was but much faster
when you when you really go on a reef on
the joystick yeah so it's it's just an
actuation point but you can program on
the computer how you want it to move so
you can check out different batches of
switches compared against each other so
they'd go through the environmental
testing that we'd seen earlier or it
would be say something that had just
been pressed 50 million times versus
something that hadn't or anything that
you want to compare and you test a batch
of switches and the idea is that you'd
look at the exact force required to
press it down and then pull it back up
and then you'd also be looking at where
the actuation point was for the switch
and the idea is that you'd want to see
as much consistency as possible within a
batch and then as much consistency as
possible after 50 million key so after
50 million keystrokes it should have
either not gotten that much worse or
gotten better and the funny thing about
Cherry is that they're whole well our
key switches are validated for 50
million thing is based on this whereas I
don't think we really have any assurance
of what up to let's say for example 60
million keystrokes
meems right does that mean it performs
the same or better or it still actually
functions at all and sherry actually has
testing up to a hundred million they
just want to show us those numbers not
show us those numbers I think they're
not quite as perfect anymore though why
not so the switch we saw on the last
piece had a clear housing so we can tell
it's an MX RGB so that's from the
Corsairs corsair gaming RGB line of
keyboards but one of the coolest thing
about the RGB keyboards is actually that
the way the LEDs are embedded in the PCB
instead of in the housing for the key
switch makes them less prone to failure
due to ESD but of course there are other
electrostatic discharge concerns as well
so this was a pretty cool piece of
scientific equipment once
two eight eight thousand volts oh my
fault so many volts so he would he would
charge up a metal plate that was on the
table and then make sure very
confidently make sure that there was no
electrostatic charge going from the
table up through the keyboard so he was
just typing on it and the keyboard has
to operate aside from not zapping the
person who's using operate flawlessly so
he's using the keyboard while charging
the tape with the metal table with eight
thousand volts and then he would take
the eight thousand volt conductor and
put it right on the keyboard and have to
be able to continue using the keyboard
with no faults no glove or anything just
using the keyboard well okay they did
say that even though it's quite painful
it's not gonna you're not gonna be see
very low amperage very low current it's
not gonna really hurt anybody although I
asked actually I don't know if you were
there first
yeah I asked him do you ever like sneak
up behind anyone and give them the eight
thousand yeah so chary takes keyboards
very seriously but they can still have
some fun yeah fairly so we got to see
Jerry's first mechanical keyboards for
this hole made with m8 switches you what
Nate Oh anyways it was designed so that
when making a newspaper instead of
individually placing each one of the
letters onto this giant grid so they
could mass print newspaper you just
typed it up you could type it it was
revolutionary bizarro land keyboard ever
was sold weirdest keep all the ghosts
witches go that way go this way go
possibly both ways and apparently
spacebar stabilizers spacebar
stabilizers didn't really seem to be a
thing I don't know if those maybe were
in there at the beginning and they were
taken out fell out they were definitely
not a thing when I was trying it that
was it was really heavy too yes
fullmetal construction on the whole
thing so with that with the original
keyboard out of the way we asked very
very nicely if we would be allowed into
the Cherry MX production area and they
were very kind about saying no yeah they
wanted to protect their trade secrets
you know all the improvements that
they've made to Cherry MX key switches
over the over the years that have been
not quite copied correctly by anyone who
might be
I need to copy the design they didn't
want anyone to look at that so uh yeah
yeah anyway so we were able to make a
compromise of being able to check out
the actual keyboard yeah so first we got
gear DUP this is my first time wearing
an ESD lab coat and electrostatic
sandals yeah yeah so you take this
little electrostatic strap and put it
under your under your shoe and then into
your sock or in Lance's case under your
I prefer to call them electrostatic
sandals but sure whatever whatever you
want to call it and then this was really
cool now Jerry was telling us this
production line is actually 20 years old
yeah so this is far from the state of
the art that we might find in some of
the top-secret areas so it starts with
the crazy robot arm and I mean I was
blown away when he told me this line is
20 years old
yeah and is like nothing to do with the
advanced nough some of the other more
top-secret lines because this arm like
picks up the keyboards top half bottom
half puts them on the line and then it
all scooches to the right to the right
to the red oh no anyways these ones it
didn't it didn't require individual key
cap placement so we didn't get to see
some of the stations running yeah he
said it was a lot cooler earlier in the
day but these this is like a special
order for the German government so all
the key caps were sort of preassembled
so it's gift a lot of the stations but
what's cool is that the station's
automatically know if a step doesn't
need to be done automation and they just
don't do it yep
so it went through and the the next
stage actually that we did get to see
was it testing all the switches so this
giant machine that was pre aligned for
every single one of the key caps would
go down and press every single button
just to make sure it worked and I didn't
quite believe it when sherry told us at
first that every single product was a
hundred percent tested because I kind of
went really that's too much man
but they are and we even saw a keyboard
fail yeah yeah we got to see one fail so
the next station which was the laser
engraving station I was so cool that
which was like the coolest thing ever
like did you
two individual lasers going insanely
fast although apparently slow because
apparently it's a ten-year-old laser
engraver and is much slower than all
their other ones but seemed really fast
to me would go through and engrave all
the key caps unless it failed so when we
saw that one going through production
fail it skipped the the laser engraving
station there was a big red light that
went off very serious business someone
ran over and pulled it off the line
inspected it manually noticed that
apparently the Machine told them the
spacebar failed so they found that it
was the stabilizing wire below the
spacebar which was actually not aligned
properly so he aligned it properly
manually put it back at the beginning of
the assembly process and it went through
all the testing again when it passed
then it got laser engraved and then it
went to packaging very cool I mean I
think the thing that stood out most to
me about the entire cherry tour was the
obsessive attention to detail and
quality testing validation for secondary
validation for something that I just
completely took for granted yeah until I
saw what goes into the amount of science
the amount of everything that goes into
these little tiny switches so I guess I
guess that's pretty much it I huge
thanks to cherry for letting us really
take a look under the kimono so to speak
of their manufacturing process thanks to
