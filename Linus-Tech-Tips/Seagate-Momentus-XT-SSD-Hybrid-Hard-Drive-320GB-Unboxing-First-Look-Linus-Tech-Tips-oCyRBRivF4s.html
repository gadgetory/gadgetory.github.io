unboxing this is the Seagate momentous
XT and it is an unbagging rather more
than an unboxing this is a 320 gigabyte
version of the drive but it's available
in a few different capacities and this
is a revolutionary device the reason is
because and you can see that when I open
it up it will come out of the bag and
1/2 inches and it will have a SATA
interface or SATA 2 rather power and
data and then jumpers but so far I
haven't shown you anything revolutionary
about it what's revolutionary about this
is actually what's under the hood
this is a magnetic drive that's why you
get a nice high capacity at a very
reasonable price but it also has a small
4 gig SSD built in now that doesn't mean
that you actually get any significant
capacity boost you're not adding the SSD
for that you're adding the SSD built in
in order to get a speed boost so while
you won't quite get the speed of an SSD
you won't be stuck with the speed of a
hard drive now I'm also gonna explain a
little bit how all this works we've had
cache on hard drives for a very very
long time
cache acts as a way for the hard drive
to take frequently accessed data and
throw it on to a much faster storage
medium so that for for like a quick
rendom read or a quick random write you
can use the cache for much faster
performance than if you actually had to
wait for the disk to rotate for the arm
to seek and for it to find that bit of
data now what an SSD allows us to do is
have a much larger cache typically even
on a high-end desktop drive these days
you're gonna see only about a 32 Meg to
a 64 Meg cache so when we start
introducing a 4 gigabyte SSD cache that
yeah well it's not as fast as normal
cache but it is much bigger and it does
give much much better performance for
small random reads and writes vs.
magnetic okay so basically what you
gates aiming to do with this is take
some of the very frequently used data
things like your OS so you can reduce
things like boot time as well as very
frequently asked accessed programs
you can speed up the performance of this
drive and then you can also just have
regular performance when you load on
your main programs and any sort of large
data storage files so what they're doing
on a micro scale is what a lot of people
have been doing for a while is they're
taking a small SSD and using it as their
boot drive for their boot drive in their
critical applications and then they're
installing a separate magnetic hard
drive in their system from a storage
well now it's all in one unit very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
