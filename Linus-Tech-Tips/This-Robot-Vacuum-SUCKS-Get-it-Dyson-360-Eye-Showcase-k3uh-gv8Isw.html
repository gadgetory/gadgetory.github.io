finale of the window TV is actually that
my office is in no state to do a
finished showcase of my office
fortunately we can all thank Dyson for
sending over the 360 I robotic vacuum
thanks to this guy I'm gonna be doing a
video today where I clean my office
using this vacuum cleaner and then start
working on the finale let's try it out
we're still a long way away from robotic
vacuums that actually pick crap up off
your floor for you but I mean the good
news is my crap on the floor is very
first world problem crap this is pretty
cool this is our new like wireless hdmi
to networking streaming doodad
but indefinitely the box I don't invite
these disasters you know I'm a victim
here I got to get this stuff out of here
if I'm gonna try to vacuum oh wow now
that I'm closed up it is really dirty
this is what happens when you like do a
bunch of construction in your office and
then never actually like clean it after
this room is disgusting look at it
you can see me cleaning sorry how much
have here that I can clearly see me
addressing the problem this is like when
I come into your office and I'm like
Colby get these sales numbers are
terrible and you're literally on a sales
call okay
so I think we're ready for the next
stage now
this unboxing total lie because we
actually already had it open once before
but basically you get the reminder to
get the Dyson link app so I'm gonna grab
that it's on the App Store and Google
Play Store a lifestyle I go yeah I guess
cleaning is a lifestyle if you're in my
wife not by choice I mean I clean too
just to be clear really digging a hole
for myself here this robot vacuum great
for vacuuming mister missus miss MS dr.
professor Lord lady sir captain
commander Colonel I don't know
Lieutenant Colonel major rabbi Reverend
sister and whatever can is I'm Canadian
so go with that global navigation with
app level help and support assign a name
or location to your Dyson machine cool
add your machine robot vacuum step 1
confirm your home Wi-Fi network so Dyson
claims that their design gives it two
times the fucking power of other robotic
vacuums and this was collected in one
run but a after our cleaning service
came in like there's large objects in
here so either this thing's awesome or
we need a new cleaning service oh why
did I do that
or both well I mean I guess we're gonna
we're gonna vacuum it back up
whoa check this out this thing's got
like tank treads on it so this is
actually actually call them tag tracks
so that's apparently so that it can
actually climb small inclines things
freakin high-tech tennis so we've got a
power plug and then we've got this is
one of the coolest features so this is
the little self docking point so it
actually uses computer vision to see
this pattern and then you just go ahead
plug this into the wall that's where the
name comes from 360 I it actually uses
the 360-degree camera here not only to
navigate around your room and plot
itself a good course after the first
time but actually to find its dock and
then go dock itself I need to figure out
how to get connected to the Wi-Fi though
so it's charging
Oh what the heck there's a USB port in
here check that out ah there it is
Wi-Fi information nice enter the eight
digit password coming back here okay and
we're connecting to Wi-Fi now we figured
out what that USB port is for it's for
performing firmware updates or resetting
your Wi-Fi so I can set a schedule to
get it to do this every day I can get it
to clean clean in fact your robot has
cleaned 10 years we can believe it got
that much crap out of 10 square meters
all need it like mapped out what it did
there you go
started like that you can't cut you
can't cut now Dennis
Wow listen to that thing go
what is fascinated by these kinds of
things it actually sucked up all this
stuff even though it only got about that
close to it
so one of the things that does is look
like it's randomly moving around the
room but what it's actually doing is
dividing up the space into segments
before cleaning each segment
systematically okay well I think all
that's left to do is let my little robot
Butler here deal with this tonight I'm
gonna go play some badminton and come
back and have a look tomorrow
okay so here it is next morning had my a
night of the living robot cleaner deal
with the office here and actually if for
one Cass not bad not bad at all but the
real test because I'm truly a lazy man
and I want my robot cleaner to clean not
just the floor but also the desk I mean
look at this desk it's horrible here we
go oh oh here we go okay okay yeah
that's my network switch
cleaning my mousepad
oh okay
it's on the really look okay now this is
the way to clean your mousepad
oh is it gonna dock now is it done not
bad little 360 I so come in here and
have a look yeah that one's blue so
that's not fair to judge it based on
okay missed a little bit of glitter in
this corner but overall man that is a
lot better I think the most impressive
thing was how it like navigated through
and managed to climb over all the cables
and stuff around over here a great job
of cleaning the mousepad too so thanks
