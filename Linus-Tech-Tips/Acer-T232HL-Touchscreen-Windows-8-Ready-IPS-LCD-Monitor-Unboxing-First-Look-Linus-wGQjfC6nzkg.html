the I'm sorry talking guys I'm totally
gonna cheat here because this is a
really hard to remember model named T 23
HL BMI DS ed and for whatever reason
this is in lower case so apparently that
makes some kind of a difference don't
worry about that worry about the part
where this is the first sample of a sirs
touchscreen 1080p IPS Windows 8 ready
LCD monitor this is extremely exciting
and yes first sample in all of North
America so I have like just super super
whoops stoked on getting this thing
opened up because this is what Windows 8
is all about to me so for the gamers or
the PC enthusiasts out there who are
saying Windows 8 isn't for me because I
don't like the interface that shall not
be referred to as Metro and you know
this or that Windows 8 is about changing
the way we use our computers and I
haven't had as much experience with it
as I'd like yet partly because the
devices don't really exist yet that will
let you have a proper windows 8
experience so this is a huge step in the
right direction and now while everyone
else is talking about their tablets or
their notebooks or their all-in-one PCs
not everyone especially us enthusiast
gamers wants any of those things we want
our gaming desktop to be as good an
experience as possible so something like
this I think can bridge the gap because
instead of locking you into you know
crummy graphics or a small form factor
or whatever else now we can actually
take our proper gaming desktop and have
that touchscreen keyboard mouse hybrid
experience look as long as I can figure
out how this how this standard works ah
there we go all right there we go so
give me a second I'm gonna unpack all
this stuff and then I'll show
all the accessories so we start with the
CD as well as the manual which you may
actually need given this as a
touchscreen monitor so you should
probably download the latest from Acer
if you can but it's not the end of the
world try that out VGA cable power cable
from the power brick which is also
included HDMI cable and the DVI cable
are included so you can use either those
out of the box I'd love to see more than
just one cable included Ben Q is like
they're still including only a VGA cable
with even some of their high end
monitors which surprised me VA panels
right so Acer includes three different
video cables for you here USB a to b
cable this is great because the monitor
has a built-in three port USB 3 hub and
an audio pass-through cable so I don't
know if it has actually don't know if it
has speakers on board but let's go
through the specs really quick as well
so here you can just come in and look at
this with me so you got 1920 by 1080 yep
250 net brightness which is actually not
bad at all
whatever like 1 billion to 1 contrast
ratio whatever that works out to 5
millisecond gray degrade response time
which is pretty good for an IPS 178 when
178 degree vertical and horizontal
viewing angle which is what you'd expect
from an IPS and let's see what else Acer
has to say for themselves because I
really didn't cover this this is all the
same stuff we talked about already a
hundred million to one adaptive contrast
management power savings 10 points all
its LED backlit I should have mentioned
that before so full HD LED backlit
10-point multi-touch touchscreen water
so let's have a look at the industrial
design of it overall so you've got a
single piece of edge to edge glass that
goes all the way down to here which
means that if you're doing any kinds of
gestures that come in from off of the
screen you're not going to have the same
problem that we had with these ah these
first-generation touchscreen monitors as
well as all in ones so if you guys have
seen my Windows 8 consumer preview
you'll see that the one we're using has
this jelly and plastic bezel that makes
it kind of gonna like point your finger
in there to swipe from off screen it
really doesn't work very well this is
going to be an outstanding experience
speaking of the experience overall the
glass feels very nice
so it is glass it's not not any kind of
composite plastic or anything cheesy
like that so it's a little bit cold to
the touch what you might expect what you
guys might know from from your past
experience is some pieces of glass tend
to have a little bit more drag than
others this one actually feels very good
it's got a little bit of resistance but
not too much so let's say this piece
looks like it's a little bit separated
but this is just this is more just for
show and this piece is plastic and this
piece is glass up here on the side you
find the three USB 3.0 ports one of
these looks like it's just a charger and
the other to look like data although I'm
not a hundred percent sure about that
having not fired it up yet and then on
the back you see they've gone with a
kind of a unique look to this I like
this tend it's unfortunately not
height-adjustable but because of the
design it does have pretty ample tip oh
no way does it lie down it lies down
very flat not quite flat although that
would have been really cool you can
probably wonder if you can man it
doesn't look like there's an obvious way
to remove it so it is intended to be
used as a desktop monitor however if you
what you would do with it it does have a
base amount okay so there's your four
base amount tables so you could position
it wherever you want it ultimately and
use it however you want in its side its
touchscreen goodness so let's come down
here and we've got there's the USB mm as
well as VGA DVI and HDMI in know
DisplayPort and although it's really not
the end of the world guys I'm not sure
yet how the data is managed for the
touchscreen interface sometimes it's
passed through on the DVI although I
don't know if VGA has that capability so
it's possible the data is run through
the USB 3 so that might be a mandatory
connector but I'll have to we'll still
have to try this we are going to turn
this baby on in a full and sanics tech
tips episode featuring Windows 8 so very
very excited Kensington locks over there
sorry I missed that before and then
you've also got your audio in as well as
your DC power in this piece right here
it has has a plastic slider like not
well it's not a slider but a plastic
protector so that you're not going to
damage the arm and you can screw that on
and off but much difficulty no no that's
that's on purpose
diesels giving me sort of
look as if I'm like breaking it here but
I think that's intentional that'll keep
it from accidentally closing completely
and then falling flat on you so it's a
stopper so I think that pretty much
covers it actually oh oh there there
there sorry
there's your own screen display buttons
so no touch screen buttons that sort of
surprises me although personally I'm
still I'm still a tactile button guy
when it comes to managing my monitors
the one exception being the the
proximity sensitive BenQ buttons that
they have on their 2420 TX so I think
that pretty much wraps up thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the 10-point multi-touch IPS a CRT 23
T 2 3 2 HL LCD monitor and I hope you
guys have enjoyed this don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips for unboxings
reviews and other computer videos I
learned something about manuals today
you should probably look at them once in
a while check this out so this piece
does come out that's what this piece of
plastic is for it's for screws you just
remove the plastic cover on the top ok
just like that and probably comes off
there somehow you remove those four
screws and then you can put this side of
this cover on so that's how you can
easily mount this to some kind of a
mounting arm or whatever else you want
to do very cool stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
