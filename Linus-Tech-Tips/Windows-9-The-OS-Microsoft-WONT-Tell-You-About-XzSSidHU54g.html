version of Windows that you can't find
anywhere on Microsoft's website one that
won't track your online activities one
that's optimized for speed and
reliability and that performs better
than Windows 7 or Windows 10 will follow
me down the rabbit hole and I'll meet
you on the other side the master Keys
Pro keyboard lineup from Coolermaster is
available in three sizes each in white
or RGB flavours check them out at the
link below now Microsoft's official
reasoning for not releasing Windows 9
was that seven eight nine oh but we know
better meet Windows nine and unofficial
custom-built OS based on Windows 8.1
embedded industry pro of all things that
applies this extensive list of tweaks to
look and feel like Windows 7 because
it's an embedded OS intended for use in
payment terminals digital signage or
other industrial applications any point
one industry pro lacks telemetry and
tracking and is considerably leaner than
your standard copy of 8.1 with fewer
services running by default
despite its looks it's still Windows 8.1
under the hood which by the way is a
good thing you get newer features like
smb3 dism recovery tools better memory
management the newer file copy dialog
and task manager secure boot and perhaps
most importantly to enthusiasts native
support for USB 3 so that shiny new Z
270 board will be able to install
windows 9 without worrying about
slipstreaming drivers for those of us
who keep our optical
as in a bin rather than in our box well
that all sounds great - what's the catch
well first of all you're trusting some
dude on the internet who's providing you
a modded version of Windows and second
it's virtually impossible to get a legit
license for Windows 8.1 embedded
industry pro since it's only sold as
part of an embedded system that means
that you're probably going to be limited
to a trial install which obviously isn't
ideal so what can we do about it we're
going to make our own so we're going to
take one part legitimate widely
available OS add two parts modification
and tweaks and boom windows 9.5 while
it's not going to replicate Windows 9
exactly it's going to bring us pretty
close and we are able to use Windows 10
to do it so we start with a fresh
install of Windows 10 only the updates
and benchmark tools that we'll need for
later first order of business make
Windows 10 look the part this was not
trivial but with the help of a few free
tools and resources we made it work
the first of these was a Windows 7
styled theme for Windows 10 by
deviantART users say guripa
ok I don't know next we installed Aero
glass a free tool that does what it says
on the tin shiny we followed that with
classic shell a well-known alternative
Start menu and theme utility which with
a few tweaks to its settings and a
couple of community provided textures
gives us our Windows 7 Start button
Start menu and taskbar mostly then we
still needed 7 + taskbar Tweaker to make
our show desktop button look right and
then while we're at it we'll do Explorer
does a great job of restoring the
windows 7 style Explorer look
finally you exile Community Edition
unlocks the theme we installed earlier
to complete the look all it took from
there were a couple registry tweaks a
wallah windows 7 of course
windows 9 is more than just a pretty
face it also disables windows phone home
functionality some services and some
other miscellaneous nonsense so we
followed their lead and disabled the
same items now while we can't guarantee
that our windows 9.5 has all of the
tweaks windows 9 does the key ones are
all in there you can find the full
details of the registry and telemetry
tweaks in the blog post on our forums
linked below so how do we know we've
succeeded well we use our RGB test bench
and three separate Kingston KC 400 one
terabyte SSDs each one was secured
erased then loaded with Windows 7
Windows 9 and Windows 10 so we could
perform the best possible apples to
apples comparison then we ran our tests
multiple times on each windows and our
own 9.5 mod the results honestly weren't
quite what we were expecting in rise of
the Tomb Raider we can see that compared
to Windows 7 Windows 9 scored almost
identically on average while Windows 10
and 9.5 were basically identical - okay
moving on to Deus Ex mankind divided we
can see that Windows 9 actually flunked
the test
yeah no matter what we did Square Enix's
DRM triggered every time on 9 but
otherwise our results were basically the
same city skylines showed off better CPU
performance in 10 and 9.5 with a
tangible boost of 5 to 6 frames per
second likely down to support for Intel
Speedshift technology on our kb lake
platform and then rounding out our
gaming tests Crysis 3 brings us back to
basically a wash across the OS is tested
today this is starting to feel like a
workshop video next we tested system
performance starting with a networked
file transfer over 10 Gigabit LAN this
one was actually pretty surprising
because Windows 7 held its own against
our newer operating systems in spite of
SMB 3.0 even when testing with groups
of smaller and mixed size files PC mark
however tells a very different story
Windows 7 was blown away by all our
other operating systems with 9
sandwiched in the middle interestingly
that trend continued through our final
at Ohio benchmark where Windows 7 was
handily beaten by everything else the
Windows 10 edge over 9 wasn't something
we'd expected to see going into these
tests today but there it is so then is
it worth tracking down the unicorn
license for 8.1 embedded or navigating
the labyrinths and depths of deviantART
the short answer by the numbers is no
even windows 9 didn't perform as well as
we expected it to the long answer though
has a lot in common with our does $1000
Windows perform better the video we did
back in late January the difference
between editions of Windows just doesn't
seem to matter much even across
generations while there are some cases
where drivers or support for hardware
features like speed shift can make or
break a certain workload it really just
boils down to user experience privacy
features and support and that is where
mods like Windows 9 or 9.5 shine but
what do you guys think did you expect
the numbers we got are you going to run
Windows 9 or go to the effort of making
your own nine and a half let us know in
