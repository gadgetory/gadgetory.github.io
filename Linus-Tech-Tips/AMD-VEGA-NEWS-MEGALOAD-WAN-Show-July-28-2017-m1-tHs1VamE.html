no offense no offense to anyone from
Cloverdale who may be watching because
you probably didn't understand what we
said anyway you've a really great like
horse accessory and saddle store
it's wonderful anyways there's tons of
Vega news like like every single other
wine show from 2017 so that's not too
far all the Vega leaks like like if
there was if there was a crossfire leak
it would be like vagabond I think put
them together oh my goodness I think if
Vega was a ship it just wouldn't have a
bottom anymore because it sank notice
the leak there's so many leak oh no only
I'm allowed to make jokes that bad sorry
no you don't have you don't have a
terrible terrible joke privilege that
that I assume oh that I am joy I'm
trying to graduate I'm working around oh
there's so much a graduation as a sort
of a debating you know what we've got
rumors about price we've got rumors
about performance we've got tons of
stuff so stay tuned for that memories
about what it looks like we also have
the intel core x series full specs have
apparently been leaked leaks all over
plays it even leaks anymore who knows
what's a core X I don't even know flash
is going to die in 2021 right
all the other times that it's been
stated flashes going to die this time
it's actually going to die it's like
actually super super actually dying this
time so that's pretty sick yeah Oh
course they're course they're got got
got yo it got got by investors it was
bought yeah
also our a former employer NCIX closed
its retail stores in Ontario for good
for good I don't know if that's good so
much as it's bad it it's bad
intro time index no intro yet we need
shirts yeah I want a shirt that just
says no but I can get a shirt that just
says yes yeah oh yeah we can throw in
like shirt no oh yeah naked yes that's
business tattoo that you get under it

hahaha every few times she would she
would like she would actually be feared
like she's not really a like getting mad
kind of person she's more of a like
disappointed and frustrated person not
like a mad like yelling person but that
would actually be a thing I could do
that would be like full-on like trigger
on I could see that fake tattoo yes all
fake tattoo in the promotional materials
he could have a fake tattoo she doesn't
watch YouTube so like a rather Rancho we
YouTube I'm sorry I am like
heis yeah yeah so like fake tattoo you

yeah because you could say that it was
like a promotional thing for the shirt
and you don't really care cause you're
just gonna wear shirts anyways yeah oh I
like it I like it that would be awesome
so it's floatplane yes thank you very
much so the only problem is that we
wouldn't be able to do it on Twitch
unless I got some some tape actually ah
Alice do you have some electrical tape
that I could borrow it seems like the
kind of thing you would have on hand I
think it would look really fake no no no
hold on God the black one the up and
right down and right yeah that one
perfect tape me thank you
alright so no wait no oh you're going to
tape them over so so basically I figure
oh wow with do I can't believe you're
doing that oh my gabion okay okay so so
I could pull off the shirt and then I
could have like the bed there that was a
no nipple shirtless right so be like
haha shirt no and then like we've naked
yes and that yeah I honestly yeah no
nipple yes yeah what if we show even
about anymore it's what you have to know
nobody knows this whole straw does not
show we used to do straw polls now we've
evolved into just like it is our
language now we speak straw poll alright
so we do actually have a lot of tech
news for you guys this week we're going
to start with a sponsor spot and there's
reason for that note there's a valid
reason for that because FreshBooks is
the sponsor not only of the land show
but also of LTX which is going to be the
happiest thing in clover - he'll be City
oh it's not gonna be in Cordova yeah but
it would it'll still be the heaviness
and card health even though it's not
Oh oh dang it will be the coolest thing
to do income so we've got some details
about LTX LTX event details I think
there's like a post on the forum from
that what is Ivan yes Ivan will be there
Ivan yes indeed so there it is LTX
carnival flash meetup apparently the
floorplan and stuff is not actually
posted here no no I know I don't know
floor plans not posted here for some
reason that somewhere over on ticket
rocket no not Twitter I think Twitter
seriously we actually don't have gosh
darn it you just want everything in one
place then you're like damn I'm in
clover there's literally nothing here oh
yeah there's the shirt design so for
people who got the big package they're
getting one of these shirts I think in a
special color something like that here
we go here we go here we go so here's
the floor map that we've got finalized
ish now this is the case toss so you
throw cases as far as you can this is
great have a seat yeah have a seat
Corsair is going to be here free gigs
going to be here scrapyard Wars so we're
going to have unedited okay
continuous scrapyard war footage during
the show okay
silent auction here so there's going to
be relics of line of tech tips which
will have to beat me to get the ball
Mike head oh you know what I think they
didn't do it okay yeah they must not
have added a but the fire PC still there
too they've got it they've got a ton of
good stuff they've got a kind of good
stuff
Lambo booth so you can you can see more
on the legendary Lambo but I think that
actually moved outside but it'll be
there somewhere okay though TAC VR so
Luke's going to be there Taron editing
so showing you guys how he edits a line
of tech tips video Jos ting is here 16 K
gaming will be here so you will get to
actually experience it people people are
voting

ASIS you get to play csgo against dead
yeah hamster ball geoguessr against John

demonstrations and tutorials
those guys are freaking awesome sumo
cash grab and ball pit and there's going
to be so much swag yeah like actually an
insane amount like actually every single
person who attends should walk away with
multiple pieces of swag and I'm not
talking like everybody's going to get a
graphics card but there will be graphics
card giveaways
which lots of thing I think that's super
cool because I'm kind of I'm kind of
into the whole swag thing and packs all
these really big conventions it's been
kind of going down a little bit because
some of the biggest proponents of swag
was always the hardware the hardware
guys love the swag it's freaking awesome
they love the swag so so anyway back to

fresh books talk column slash win and
get a free trial today enter when and
how did you hear about us section
alright so moving on to the actual show
now yes should we just try and get
through all the mega news ah sure okay
there's a lot a lot a lot of it's like
not quite a repeat but borderline all
right young Kang young Kang posted this
on the form the original articles from
video cards dot-com this is apparently
according to the video cards leaked what
the Vegas 64 reference design will look
like something like that according to
the leak I can neither confirm nor deny
that looks like three DisplayPort ports
and an HDMI so DVI is gone ZZZ that's
not surprised no more DVI no more VGA
both of those are probably fine
I don't like not having VGA to be
perfect not having VG is all annoying
but like when was the last time you even
had it DVI um so Nvidia did away with it
I think on Pascal yeah yeah so MD has
followed suit that looks like two 8-pin
connectors which is interesting that
goes and then this is apparently a Vegas
64 limited edition limited edition yeah
okay and then they're saying there will
be a liquid Edition and there are no
pictures yet of that Oh interesting
okay so there's a there's the leaks you
can take those for what they are if the
card looks like the top one though
I actually you know what I'm not going
to lie I like the look of this design
better than I like the look of the
limited edition design really yeah so
this looks like a brushed kind of thing
because brushed depending on whether
it's like metal or plastic can actually
end up looking kind of cheap yeah you
know yeah that's fair III think if you
have the right build and it's a limited
edition so that might make sense the
right build accenting that could look
really cool if you have the right case
you have the right other components all
I kind of sight but then I feel like the
non Limited Edition and this makes sense
would go much better with a more
standard build yeah like I would need to
build around this yeah almost nothing is
like maybe developer you'd have to do
some custom stuff yeah but you could
make like a sick looking computer like
they're probably going to make like a
showcase PC that's built around that la
position card and it's going to look
awesome probably okay apparently Vega
fire strike scorers have appeared so
this was posted by delicious on the
forum and the original article here is
again from video cards calm and they are
claiming that these are three separate
rx Vega scores here
the memory clocks are all the same but
the GPU clocks apparently ranged from
1536 to 1630 although I would take that
with a grain of salt because I'm not
sure exactly how they are measuring the
GPU clock whether it's like an average
of what's running during the actual
benchmark because GPU clocks are all
over the place spending on power
delivery and cooling these days so we'll
have to see that that's my thing with
all these rumours is especially with the
performance ones I don't really care
until we actually get it ourselves or
until other reviews actually start
coming out yep because like I who knows
and this is interesting so this original
article this was posted by banana-split
underscore zero zero on the forum and
the original article here oh sweet a
parent Lee rx Vega and this is in
meatball so I can't read it I'm sorry I
could hell of you guys I love you guys
okay you could like google trey it's
literally giving you the option right
there nope not out on the street okay
yeah not on the stream there you go um
so up wow this Google Translate has
gotten really goes pretty deep it starts
to collapse into AMD Vega and now
circulates the first prize information
behind the scenes okay so pretty okay so
it's pretty good very good very close
yeah um the meatball yes oh my goodness
okay good distributors in Europe
apparently have received pricing for RX
Vega in the 600 to 700 euro range which
which would be 705 to 820 US dollars
yeah now it should be noted that this
has to be taken with a grain of salt
because vendors often give out sort of
random pricing like back when I used to
work at NCIX
this would happen all the time where we
were just like gasps yeah and we would
create a skew because we couldn't cut a
Pio to the vendor unless we had a skew
and then there were time we'll know that
I mean that makes sense because when it
arrives how would the labeling staff
like know what label to put on it and
stuff okay why would you have to put a
prep can you just put a placeholder that
isn't anything um if our system was that
sophisticated we could have done that
yes that doesn't sound superstitious
yeah can you just all right let's move
on okay um so anyway it is it is fairly
common for retailers to just kind of put
a price in but the other right the other
reason to not do that might be to hide
the final pricing so there had been
times when we would create a SKU and we
were put it in for like ninety nine
thousand nine hundred ninety nine
dollars with zero yeah no because then
people would order it and there were oh
so it's a purchasable SKU I don't know
doesn't why don't you just have two and
release so there were several statuses
okay so we could never hide status
prisoner yeah where you could manually
navigate to the page and hide status was
useful for validating that like landing
pages were working in stuff so you could
click jokes for everything's actually
working and there was a discontinued
status where you could load the page but
I think pricing was just gone and there
was no buy now there's like there's all
these different statuses that you can
have and sometimes they would be broken
also NCIX the system was imperfect to
the point at least then ivan shut up to
the point where at least back then there
were at least a handful of customers who
if they found out the SKU number and you
could sort of guess because you could
find new arrivals by looking at new
arrivals and then you could find gaps in
the SKU coverings
and you could manually keep them in and
so people found ways to manually force
the sister add those in a cart so those
aren't hidden pages at all
so yeah in that case they couldn't even
navigate to the page but they could
force a dispute to the cart and buy it
oh my goodness that's yeah so it's not
hidden at all so well it depends on what
statuses be anyway the long story long
story short there are ways for these
things to happen and there are very
savvy customers out there
yeah who are trying really hard to be
like the one to leak pricing so so there
would be times when we would just fill
in BS information I don't know if you
still have this up is it this page yeah
okay random little side bit we almost
made a video here Media Markt I don't
think we actually released that video
but Media Markt is very cool oh yeah a
very cool store like you can go in there
and they have like an entire row and in
inside the row like to your left will
just be like shelves and shelves of
keyboards with like a box behind it
that's probably empty but I like
strapped down so you can see what it is
exactly what model exactly what key
switch all that kind of stuff and then
the keyboard right there and like keep
others so you can like look under it see
what the switches Wow and it type on the
keyboard and try it out on the other
side mice down the row a little bit
headphones and like actually a huge
amount of each type of category and like
brandon was there with me and they had a
whole bunch of cameras all set up that
you could like actually use with like
lighting stuff there so I actually try
it like it's a really cool store Swedish
shot Swedish consumers must be a lot
more trustworthy than North American
ones Media Markt I think is a German
company oh they're in like multiples oh
okay okay like we saw them in
Switzerland right okay yeah cool but
they're in they're in a number of well I
went there yeah yeah I went to one
because I was at the BMW shoot and we
needed a GoPro yeah they're pretty cool
yeah there were some things like they
only had like four monitor
or something and I was like that's kind
of weird when you have like actually an
insane amount of everything else but
like right there's a cool store and the
monitor they did have they had displayed
with things playing on them
I guess that's pretty cool all right yet
another Vega leak this was posted by
good to not eat tofu Friday the original
article here is from reddit and
apparently a look at the Eurasian
Economic commission's fight confirms
vega ken vega 11 vega 12 and vega 20
whatever that means i could just be code
names even yeah i actually don't know
how meaningful this is it's a little bit
of a stretch maybe okay so this is in
okay some kind of is just uh hey Ivan no
never mind
looks like kind of like Russian or like
there's quite a few countries there's a
core like what alphabet is this even
Cyrillic yeah Cyrillic thank you okay
wow there's like actually a lot of
information in here so this is like
vague at NXT MBA DT OEM which I would
have to assume is desktop om Dell with
extender and then like a part number and
then there's like all he server to
25-watt OST AI oh maybe oh maybe AMD
FirePro Vega 12 xt workstation FC st
here's a part number wow this actually
looks like fairly legit incredible huh
okay that well that's neat I guess
all right apparently 45 Vega products
were registered by AMD under the Vega
product line on the economic
Commission's website that's pretty
intense but they had like AI cards and
stuff so I don't know how specific
they're getting there it could be some
like non consumer level thing looks
pretty damn specific to me they've got a
Dell with extender right yeah then
probably like Dell with no extender yeah
so so I did might not be actually much
changing in between by the way I saw
someone fly through the chat they had
said that they just landed in Canada for
LTX no that's cool we will see you
tomorrow you're awesome we will so see
you tomorrow it is going to be great
again I'm at I'm actually super excited
for LG X okay like more excited for any
other convention that I'm going to this
year not even just saying Jeremy
dimensioned crowd size on the stage
crowd size on the stage why because I
don't think I'm getting this reference
the fake news I feel like oh there's
10,000 people here 10,000
I can't believe 50,000 people showed up
I mean going off of each other the last
time a hundred thousand people were in
the Langley Event Center there was
250,000 people there the last time there
was I didn't even know there were a
million people in Cloverdale the fact
that we can reject the fact that they
can fit two million people in the arena
is just a feat of engineering yep I'm
called up and we're like yeah we made
the best arena can fit five that's the
greatest arena okay Intel Core x-series
I actually have no idea what this is I
have not heard of any leak about this oh
okay oh okay so video cards comm is the
opie here it's kind of funny you can
tell where James decided to get his news
from each week yeah yeah yeah he was he
was hanging out on the video well mind
you all the news is about video cards
if it is right in the names isn't a
video card that's true fake news okay
all right so it's the full specs now of
the intel's high-end desktop platform so
there's ones that we knew already 78 640
x 7740
you're into that sort of thing
7900 XR review already went up that's
the 10 core 20 thread 3.3 base 4.5 boost
max 44 Lane quad channel memory blabbity
blabbity blah and then now we finally
got clock speeds for the high-end stuff
so apparently that 18 core will run it
2.6 gigahertz base and will actually
boost up almost as high as the 7900 X
which is only a 10 core which is pretty
incredible if they can get it to run in
a motherboard without lighting on fire
ah the step-down the 16 core so pricing
here that'll be 2 grand and then
replacing the 69 50 X will be a 16 core
I then my 10 core that we just upgraded
relations with gets it I actually but
you know what's cool I always thought
about my processor so so what's cool
about this is I'm salty about a new
product for the first time it okay okay
okay okay
I hear ya a little bit because normally
it would be like you just trying to
dangle purchasing decisions and you're
like you had the last one that came out
was really good so maybe I'll get that
but that's not really what happened
yeah well nothing's really happened so I
guess it doesn't matter and then out of
nowhere things come out so you kind of
got blindsided instead of like whoa
everything's fun and cool
I mean my keys sure it was like he's
probably not asking for the electric
thing okay alright
genj jigsaws wait like a robot a heat
gun a jig follow the blade in the
crowbar ballista crowbar
yeah sorry I actually need some of the
other stuff on my keychain so do my what
do I have a vehicle no I can drive home
or wherever he needs to go okay you want
to show it yeah oh yeah we're life
alright yeah bye Nick thank you and
thank you Nick
okay so full specs are in and basically
the I can see why they launched with the
7900 X because it does look like a
pretty good middle ground although I can
see to how the 79 20x for two hundred
more for two more cores actually looks
not bad as well although all of this
really depends on what AMD does with
thread Ripper and they've got a second
chart here where they are actually
trying to compare AMD versus until I
think yeah so here's haven't beat that
PCIe lanes
I know 64 PCI Express Lanes what no
actual trashman yeah like what the heck
so we don't know thread rippers XFR
frequencies but at 99 bucks that 16
thread is looking pretty our 16 core 32
thread is looking pretty frigging
competitive with a 10 core with fewer
PCIe lanes and maybe a higher boost
frequency but we don't even know TDP TBD
though as well lots of those going on
but like even just the price difference
there is ridiculous
like if you want to get up higher on
other things there's always over talking
I can't imagine based on what we know
about Zen versus skylake architecture
core by core performance frequency by
frequency performance I can't imagine
that 16 for doing anything but utterly
kerb wrecking that 10 core yeah in a
multi-threaded workload and quite
frankly if you're not talking about
these threaded workloads I don't
understand why you're talking about
skylake X or thread refer in the first
place yes that's a very important
distinction yes and like some people
need both use cases mm-hmm but usually
if you need both these cases it's not
like an extreme peak on the single pour
that you core that you need yeah and you
probably want to push your
multi-threaded that's right it's like
the vast majority of people all right
speaking of the vast majority of people
the vast majority of the all 6,000 of
you um need to
why is my Start menu auto hiding I am
super mad about that need you need to ah
moved it I was wondering what happened
to it I moved it up he moved it back
down Oh what is it this Oh dip it and I
was like oh is it company okay I'm sorry
I'm just
just waiting over here need to look at
there yes yes stalling yes stalling I
need to listen to us talk about spectra
staring at a monitor all day there's
actually not a secret that that can be
not the greatest thing for your eyes
you've got to be kidding me we're at it
James took them dang it James okay so
James personally vouches perspective
glasses an affordable solution to
staring at a computer screen all day
some monitors do have blue light filters
but many many don't including many that
come pre attached to a computer like
your laptop so the a software solution
like flux or twilight doesn't give you
the same type of filtering that an
actual colored glass does so the
features include being stylish they've
worked on their glasses making them look
like something anyone could wear around
the office quality so they got a
one-year warranty and Lowe color
Distortion thanks James I actually have
to take this so this is like super
important so you might have to jump in
and do the other one
so they're primarily focused on Canada
and us you can check about a spectrum
glasses comm slash collection slash
products or at the link below and use
offer code blindness to save 10% they
are coming to Europe very soon and I
really do have to take this and so the
next one is square space square space
square space we've been advertising
square space for freaking ever and you
guys probably know they are a web
hosting platform with beautiful
templates for pretty much whatever you
need they have 24/7 live chat and email
support if you have any issues at all
and that's helpful for if you're setting
up a Squarespace site for someone else -
like a friend or family member that runs
a business considering Squarespace has
commerce modules so you can set it up
for them and then if they have any
trouble later on down the line 24/7 live
chat and email support it cost 12 bucks
a month and if you buy it for a year you
get a domain covered for free they have
a cover page module so you can have like
a one-page site that's all beautiful and
scrollable and all that kind of stuff
also everyone can now publish in the
Apple news format if you want to have
some type of like blog that would be
very helpful there you start a trial
with no credit card required and start
building your website today go to
Squarespace squarespace.com slash when
and you get 10% off then we have fresh
books we talked about them earlier in
the show they are sponsoring LTX which
is awesome so everyone that's at LTX
will be able to benefit from their
sponsorship for lpx if you go to fresh
books comm slash one and it's your when
and the how to do here but a section you
get a free trial which is pretty
fantastic fresh books has timesheet
functionality expand functionality tons
of different things that you would need
as a company that has Pella Walker
directly in front of the camera so that
you could expense Pella for the like 0.3
seconds that he was in front of the lens
or as Pella you could expense lioness
media group for the 0.3 seconds that you
spent on camera because they might have
to license your personality and features
in like your face and other details like
that so yeah no no no phone tree no
escalations if you have any issues with
fresh books you can call them and talk
to a real person right away which is
pretty fantastic
and then that's it all the sponsor spots
are done
hooray I have no idea when Linus is
going to be back so I think I'm just
going to jump into the next article I
think I know what that phone calls about
and people at LTX will benefit a lot
from that phone call happening let me
get to the next article USB 3.2 was
announced this is going to be a little
bit of a juggle to try to get this on
the screen but it is freaking fast 2
gigabytes per second is what the USB 3.2
spec is stating right now it is a
multi-lane solution compared to the
current USB which is single-lane only an
existing USB type-c cables have been
designed with multi-lane support so
would be able to work I believe you have
to have USB 3.2 hosts and devices yeah
allowing for up to two lanes of five
gigabit per second or two lanes of 10
gigabit per second operation it's pretty
awesome let me get the article up on
screen and post it in the chat give me
one second I have to use my laptop and
Linus's laptop right now to get this
done copy that
apparently I did that whole thing with
my face hidden behind the camera sorry
about that
I'm back we're here we're doing this I'm
going to jump back to the article a USB
three-point to host connected to a USB 3
point two storage device so probably the
main things are going to see with this
early on are going to be like mass
drives or just external single enclosure
hard drive stuff like that will now be
capable of realizing over 2 gigabytes
per second of data transfer performance
over an existing USB type-c cable which
is super cool because I like invested
and bought a few different like multi
packs of USBC cable so I have a lot of
those already and would really rather
not buying new ones so thank you for
allowing that to happen and but the
cable does need to be certified for
super speed USB 10 gigabit per second
which it probably is so you're probably
fine but I don't know I would make sure
that this bit of news is hilarious but
I'm going to try to get it posted in the
twitch chat before I actually really
start talking about it but
internet-connected carwashes it's
hilarious and terrifying at the same
time I guess but that's that's the world
we live in right now that was the wrong
link sorry about that in one second copy
I'm back baby
hey all right yeah put it up we're no
longer time with this we're talking
about I'm gonna talk about USB 3.2 ya
know get rekt I don't care
hey it's pretty cool man yeah yeah yeah
I mean all of my thumb drives need to go
twice as fast some external hard drives
what about them burnable whatever man
yeah whatever
there will be more with USB yes this is
there will be more there will be cheaper
ones idle speed here's another question
there's more devices that have usb on it
instead of thunder when was one gigabyte
per second a bottleneck it's I've wanted
more for a while since when are you like
I don't need any more of that
performance what the hell is this
alright this is BS
things are happening anyways the article
that we will be talking about now is
that car wash that it's
internet-connected can be hacked it can
strike your vehicle trap passengers dose
them with water hit them with doors Wow
all this kind of stuff we believe this
to be the first exploit of a connected
device that causes the device to
physically attack someone researchers
presenting the proof-of-concept say
maybe a little bit of a stretch I think
it would be how you define an attack
yeah people that could like take over a
car and shut off its engine while it's
on a highway I would see that as a way a
form of attack I mean if a house was on
fire people being able to hack your
smart lock to stay dead bolted a
deadbolt even until the same set those
nuclear facilities that they were trying
to overload that's definitely an attack
that's super an attack yeah I don't
necessarily know what they mean by that
but I see what they're kind of saying
like being able to beat someone with it
it's a little bit different I guess yeah
so they could an attacker can send an
instantaneous command to close one or
both doors to trap the vehicle inside or
open and close one door repeatedly to
strike the vehicle a number of times as
a driver tries to flee or even even you
don't even necessarily know what's
happening you're doing the like drying
sequences you drive your car at yeah and
also it's just like pat pat pat pat pat
and just super wrecks your car the
system's run on Windows Cee and have a
built-in web server that lets
technicians configure and monitor them
over the Internet so the researchers
became interested in car washes after
hearing about an accident that occurred
years ago where technicians
misconfigured one in a way that caused
the mechanical arm to strike a minivan
and douse the family inside with water
Wow yeah pre brutal and if you are able
to use those giant mechanical arms that
are in car washes they're huge to smash
someone's car if you could crack it open
you can keep them in there and just like
flood them with water right
do super bad and then if they leave
their car you just beat them with the
giant arm thing it's actually pretty
sketch don't interconnect to your car
wash I literally see no reason for doing
that actually at all in terms of having
like control over what the arms and
stuff do that should probably be pre
coded you could maybe in Internet
connect like how much water is being
used like being able to observe how much
water is being used not to control how
much water is being used yeah I mean
it's a fine line cuz like I can
understand I can understand why they
would want to be able to reprogram it
remotely
why okay let's say um the detergent that
they used to use was discontinued by the
manufacturer due to environmental
regulation changes they have to switch
to a new detergent so they have to
completely retune all the different
stages and the arm spinning power and
there you go there's a reason I said
want to be able to have boy a fix widely
quickly but that's like you're changing
supply lines for the detergent you've
got to have people manually changing the
detergent
I feel like someone could walk up to a
thing and would you trust the average
gas station attendant to update the
firmware again my lawn would generally
rather that than an internet-connected
carwash okay if you were the business
owner of the gas station would you want
that person potentially breaking your
expensive car wash but like you also
have to look into if someone dies in
your car wash this thing beats the crap
oh yeah I get it
I get that too I'm just saying that I do
see both sides right I understand why a
car wash might want to be connected
right at the very least it should have
like you have to be on its network to be
able to do it and stuff I just like get
some better IT guys I don't know I don't
know man just saying so Twitter is
apparently testing an automatic tweet
promotion service so it's a $99 monthly
automatic tweet promotion thing
I'm amplifies all your tweets and your
profile for a full 30-day period that's
actually smart I think a lot of
companies could go okay it's only 99
bucks yeah I'd probably buy it
everything will perform better I said
that makes a lot of sense we should
probably just buy it it's no no need to
create any dedicated ads low commitment
you can cancel it anytime
it's in beta so they're giving
participants the first 30 days free very
interesting it's absolutely like a
really smart idea I haven't seen a smart
idea from Twitter in terms of
monetization yet at all and that's a
very that's a very good idea
ouch yeah I'm not kidding though and
like I think I think they probably
wouldn't even take that as a dig because
from what they've said publicly that
seems to line up with their thinking as
well huh promote your business today
okay welcome to Twitter ads celebrity
blabbity blabbity blah oh yeah I'm just
curious I'm like is it in here like
where do you know target potential you
guys can't see it right now and I think
that's because we don't necessarily know
what's going to pop up on screen yeah I
don't have a Twitter ads account so like
this is stupid why don't TechCrunch is
article have a link to oh it's a private
beta private beta aimed at small
businesses and individuals rather than
big brands well I want it I want to try
it I want people to care about my my
tweets handle cuz it knows you're logged
in and it didn't know what handle yet Oh
Twitter come on guys Oh Twitter it shows
like his logo because he's logged in in
the corner and it's like what hand what
what handle do you I hate that oh no
never mind technology and computing is a
category that is fantastic
okay due to the limited nature we cannot
support other target audiences okay
terms and conditions I agree I'm not a
robot and submit okay so we're applying
right now this is a closed beta program
please be sure that to make the
information match your handle on your
invitation if you're not part of the
initial invite list we have recorded
your application we'll follow up if we
open the beta cool all right well I want
to give Twitter my money I don't really
but we'll see apparently Twitter added a
total of zero new users last quarter uh
like I'm thinking net yeah isn't that
terrifying if your whole value of your
company is your user base but then like
how do you add home value of their
company is the the what do I don't
remember what his handle is the real
Donald Trump or whatever I was looking
through handles recently and I typed at
and the first thing that came up was
that and I promise you I've never been
to that account I'm not even just saying
that about him I don't go to political
people Twitter accounts because I don't
care Wow yeah all right then now yeah we
hope not now you can buy solar energy
from your neighbor on a blockchain I
don't really have much else to say about
that it's a new york-based startup and
they want to help electricity users buy
energy from their energy producing
neighbors using smart meters and an app
that seems like a niche within a niche
within a niche and that's great um
there's also mention of megawatts where
you're paid to turn your water heater
and other energy drains off I don't know
why you'd be paid for that I'm assuming
because you'd be able to sell more to
your neighbors but I don't I'm not
really sure this is pretty fascinating
so tax evaders must now fear Instagram
in India anyway check this out holiday
posts on Instagram
tipping off India's tax collectors so a
photo of your shiny new car or Facebook
post about your chic holiday cottage may
cause you to get audited
I mean it was a matter of time before
this was going to happen but India's
government will begin
amassing a warehouse of virtual
information starting next month
collected not just from traditional
sources like banks but also social media
sites they'll be looking to match
residents spending patterns with their
income declarations so they'll be able
to spot those who pay too little tax
without like raiding their homes the way
that they do now
very interesting so in 2016 only 37
million of India's 1.3 billion people
filed tax returns Wow that's somewhere
in the neighborhood of 37% wait what
yes sorry 33% 3% so India's efforts are
similar to the UK's connect which is
estimated to have cost about a hundred
million pounds but prevented the loss of
5.4 billion in revenue and apparently
the number of criminal prosecutions has
risen wow that's incredible by like
seven hundred percent from one hundred
and sixty-five a year to eleven sixty
five unbelievable me Amazon launches
parcel delivery lockers for apartment
buildings so yeah it's kind of boring
apparently YouTube read and Google Play
Music are going to merge to create a new
service the original article here is
from the verge and they've confirmed
that it'll be one service to cover
everything almost I mean I don't really
understand what the real difference is
other than branding here because they
were already including Google Play Music
with YouTube red I am super stoked to
hope that my Google Play Music account
will now include YouTube red but I'm not
sure about that but they basically said
they needed to merge the two services to
help educate consumers and bring in new
subscribers right now it's just kind of
unnecessarily complicated so there's
YouTube red which remove that from
videos and once you save them offline
while also giving you access to Google
Play music for free then there's YouTube
music which anyone can use but gets
better if you're signed up for YouTube
red and
YouTube TV is an entirely separate thing
but not available everywhere yet so
they're combining the teams working on
the two streaming services or rather
they combined them earlier this year I
guess really the last thing left on the
show today is a look at what's going on
over on slow-playing Club I guess I
could also do like a teaser for LTX so
one thing that's not going to be at LTX
after all is the arcade machine Anthony
has been away on a personal matter this
week and he was the one who was going to
kind of get all the little things that
weren't quite done about it tidied up
and get it transported there and it
looks like we're not going to be able to
get that done
but we are still going to have a bunch
of cool stuff there 16k gaming is still
going to be there and on that subject I
guess we can have a look at what's over
on the slow plane so the crappiest SLI
setup of all time pretty fun video that
went up on Wednesday the conclusion of
gaming at 16k resolution is up so if you
guys are going to want to binge watch
some some LTT that'll be included in
there the how we make our videos video
wait oh people but people have to do is
comment on we really need a better like
sort by original post can you do that
sort by oh yeah look at that uh wait
what it's currently on that oh okay way
to go noob alright
we tried apples forgotten game console
from 1996 this was a really good one was
so much fun yeah intel stock cooler on
steroids there's like a roided-out
version of these like whoa not really
yeah that's cool yeah that's interesting
Logitech G power play that was a
simultaneous release ultimate sleeper PC
build oh I'm excited to see that
actually have you ever watched it I've
seen the intro intro is fantastic you're
too busy developing the site if you
actually use the site weighted calling
people and doing weird business he stuff
way to go way to go oh yeah
sounds super fun yeah okay so we found
out who was stealing the cutlery also
Colton is pretending he's a cop people
like this man yeah I know it's actually
a pretty funny reader oh yeah good job
cold I won't spoil it but the ending is
pretty epic I also haven't seen that the
ending is pretty I've been wanting to
watch it there's actually another video
that's going to be going up very shortly
we've got another warehouse construction
update oh cool you have you been up
there recently yes this actually looks
really nice yeah I'm pretty excited I'm
like super excited I'm stoked that even
though my office is moving a lot I'm
like pretty much equi distant from the
kitchen yeah Christmas actually and
there's two kitchens now well no that's
100 from the new kitchen yep
and you are going to be the closest
person in the building to the shower oh
it's upstairs yeah yeah yeah the
bathroom in the corner there is the one
with the shower actually awesome I'm
gonna yeah anyway yeah I'm probably
gonna start doing like I'm gonna shower
so much well I might start doing sport
lunch time for at lunch Mariana yeah all
right so did you have anything else I
there's a there's a minor issue with one
of the booths and I have the solution at
my home because I collect things so I
will solve the problem it wasn't ours
wasn't our problem okay yeah there's a
minor issue with one of my things but
I'm not sure is that the thing I was
working on oh oh oh oh show that there
was a minor issue with that which will
also be at LTX oh you can only see the
side of it really you guys want to lift
it up we should but don't move too close
like keep it blurry keep it blurry
because you're gonna have to be at LTX
if you want to you guys got it
oh so that's going to be a pretty
interesting build log don't don't look
too much don't look too much don't look
too much okay so that'll be at LTX and
the video will be coming soon
oh yeah so it's going to be it's going
to be a cool show I'm actually super
stoked I really hope I get one of my
demos that is like you know no offense
to any anyone else and everything
they're doing but will actually be the
most exciting thing at the show is
straight-up not working right now okay
so I've got 15 hours nice if if it
doesn't work will you take each half and
show them I don't know let's keep it
mysterious oh my for basic you guys
we'll see you again next week same batch
time as same bat-channel if you haven't
already go sign up for floatplane club
yes copy link address i'm going to post
that in twitch chat and yeah you will
see you guys at LTX if you're going to
be there floatplane yes LTX yes heck
yeah okay there we go
where is it
everyone's flipping out about the like
teaser you know I'm sorry guys there's
nothing I can do
and no after-party yes sorry guys I
don't think we're doing an after-party
today we've got a lot of planning to
deal with for tomorrow like no one's no
one's going home right now but we can't
we can't keep streaming I will have my
thing but it's going to be late so there
you go don't expect any time frame for
that that makes any sense at all there
we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
