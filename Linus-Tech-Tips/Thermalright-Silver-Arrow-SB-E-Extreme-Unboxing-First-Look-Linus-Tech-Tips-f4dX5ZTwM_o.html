the thermal rate haha Silver Arrow SPE
so at sandy bridge-e so that means it
supports LGA 2011 extreme so I have
actually already taken a look at two
very similar coolers in the past the co
gauge arrow which is sort of like a less
finished version of the silver arrow and
the silver arrow now I get to check out
the silver arrow extreme it definitely
comes with a more extreme sticker the
last thermal write sticker I got was
much less extreme than that totally
different colors it looks like it comes
with some different fans and it comes
with two of them which is very exciting
as well so they've added support for LGA
2011 which is new who different colored
fans to those look extreme that is for
certain so we've got a red frame and
orange blades on this 140 millimeter fan
however check this out because it uses a
rounded frame you can easily mount these
two 120 millimeter mounting holes in
your case or whatever else you're using
as long as you have enough space around
it to accommodate the 140 millimeter
size of the blades so here let's go
ahead and pull this bad boy out as well
there's another one matching okay
the extremeness is piling up here next
we have the cooler itself oh it is more
extreme look at that it has a
significantly more extreme shape
compared to the original thermal right
Silver Arrow this thing is oh this thing
is gorgeous Thermal right coolers really
are the cream of the cream when it comes
to performance and aesthetics so here
let's go alright there we go so all the
accessories are in here they also have
phenomenal mounting mechanisms and I
hope I'm not about to be sort of shown
up here as I pull out like plastic
mounting pieces nope not at all
check this out once I get my handy knife
and actually open it so you all had it
open in my pocket that could have been
bad I could have lost like sick
chicken parts of my anatomy with that
going on
it's not a good thing it's a bad thing
yes lick agrees that's bad okay so I
talked about solid mounting hardware
check this out we are totally going to
do this we are going to pull out the
iPhone size comparison for this this is
a solid piece of steel it is going
nowhere not anywhere will it go awesome
love to see it same thing with the back
plate the back plate is going nowhere it
weighs like three pounds
look at this thing similar thickness to
the to the hold-down plate actually
looks like it might even be a little
thick no they're about the same again
not going anywhere
Universal compatibility so there's your
775 1155 1156 and 1366 or 2011 or
something whatever they're all in here
oh maybe 775 is no longer not supported
okay well I'll assume they're all in
there somewhere maybe one two three four
actually okay
awesome they've also got anti conductive
non conductive pads and spacers and all
the little pieces you need here's all
the hard mount mounting screws so it
does use a hard mount system which is
again awesome and not going anywhere and
let's get this iPhone off the table
let's get these keys off the table and
let's be done with the actually let's be
done with the mounting hardware for now
we're going to go along to the
instructions so check this out I love
the way thermal rate does their
instructions so these actual sorry these
were - these weren't isolating pads
these are isolating pads for the fins
anti vibration pad so you can mount them
on there using these clips and not have
to worry about any vibrations being
transferred to your cooler the spacer
ring here is the only piece and as well
as these isolating pieces are the ones
that keep all the metal pieces off your
motherboard and safe so they've got
different instructions for different
sockets and how to do everything that
you need to do and all the hardware is
included of course just make sure this
is you know what this is like you know
Linus Linus common sense tips but a lot
of people have problems with this guys
when you install it on your LGA 1155
system don't throw away like the AMD
mounting hardware or the 2011 mounting
hardware
whatever else the case may be because
who knows you may upgrade your system at
some point and it may be handy to still
have that alright next we have six fan
Clips why would they do that when they
only include two fans well because you
can get an additional fan and go one two
three four like a double-layered
sandwich effect not that you'd actually
eat a heatsink because that would be
stupid
you would die you would literally die if
you ate this it would shred your insides
but I'm sure you weren't planning to do
that last couple of included accessories
and look at the sleeving quality on
these that's outstanding is it focusing
okay that's great love it love what
thermal writes done there okay so what
they've got going here is two four pin
PLD these are four pin feet up pwm fans
again excellence leaving on the fans as
well check that out love it so - 4 pin
pwm connector so you can plug that into
a single CPU connector on your
motherboard or you can plug them into a
molex they are both wired up and if you
didn't want one of these connectors you
could just go ahead and no wait hold on
it no you'll need both sorry power is
provided by this and then PWM is
provided by this so you're going to want
to run that sort of like behind your
motherboard or something all that is
sort of one nice little but that's like
individually sleeved cable effect people
love that stuff these days finally guys
the heatsink itself so the difference
between the co guage arrow and the
silver arrow was the finish on it so it
had a much shinier much more reflective
much more blinged-out looking finish
they both had the same number of heat
pipes they both have the same general
design although the Silver Arrow had a
much nicer overall finish to things like
the tops of the heat pipes you know how
heat pipes always have one finished end
one rounded end and win one pinched end
because they come in standard lengths
and that's not always suitable for you
know whatever various cooler so they
pinched them shut in order to keep the
gasses and the liquids inside them so
thermal wright has implemented these
caps on here so that it'll look uniform
on both sides and gorgeous no matter
what you do now you can see what they've
done is actually the heat pipes in the
center here closer to where the die of
the CPU is actually located actually
have more fins on them so it goes up
higher and then
as you move out away from the dye of the
CPU there are fewer and fewer and fewer
Finn's actually attached to that
particular part of the bottom of a
cooler now I'm expecting the finish on
here to be immaculate because it's
thermal right I can already tell from
the way lights reflecting off it it's
got a bit of a bow and what a bow does
is it puts more pressure on the very
center which aids in thermal compound
spreading and it also helps to make
stronger pressure between or to have
stronger pressure between the CPU
heatsink itself and the heat spreader on
the CPU in exchange sort of the die so
there's the tighter that contact point
is and the less space there is in
between all those components the better
your cooling will be because the better
the heat transmission will be now of
course we can't you know get away from
the obligatory finger shot there so that
is how shiny and reflective it is
although it should be noted guys
reflectiveness does not necessarily
indicate flatness which is much more
important when it comes to CPU cooling
total number of heat pipes on this bad
boy is eight there are eight heat pipes
running in a u-shape down through the
bottom here up through the other side it
looks absolutely stunning in its
shininess I'm going to go ahead and
off-camera we're going to install the
fans so you can see what it'll actually
look like once you put those on well if
we were going for the extreme look I
think we have achieved that with the red
and orange and the silver and the
shininess and just yeah this thing's
looks friggin awesome thank you for
checking all my unboxing and first look
at the thermal right Silver Arrow Xtreme
