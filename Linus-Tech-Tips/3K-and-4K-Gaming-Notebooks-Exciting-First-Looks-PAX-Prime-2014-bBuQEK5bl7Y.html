to you by HyperX gaming products make
sure you click their logo to check out
the great gaming content on their
YouTube channel as well as phantom glass
the ultimate gorilla glass screen
protector for your mobile device we're
here from the Intel booth again and this
time it's not about desktops it is all
about next generation gaming experiences
on the notebook side of things know we
don't necessarily have an octal core CPU
in any of these but what we do have is
extremely high resolution displays and
actually very passable gaming
experiences on notebooks that are
running at either 3k or 4k resolutions
so we're gonna kick things off with the
lenovo y50 this is a model that we've
actually reviewed before this one
features a touchscreen 4k display it's
got a Core i7 quad core processor and a
gtx 860m and I think the main selling
point for this one aside from the
excellent like outstanding keyboard is
the value this is one of the lowest
price perspect notebooks available on
the market and they don't really skimp
on the build quality either a very
impressive machine but if I only showed
you stuff you've seen before this video
wouldn't be very interesting this is the
Asus GX 500 this is a pre-production
sample but it gives us a pretty good
idea of what's gonna be coming of course
Core i7 quad-core processor wouldn't
really belong in the Intel booth if it
didn't have one of those the GPU in here
is an 8 6 DM but who knows what kind of
specs it will come out with because this
notebook isn't even in mass production
yet and is not due to be available for
purchase for at least a couple more
months it also has a 4k glass-top IPS
display it also has a touchscreen
although this one again pre-production
not quite working yet and the idea of it
is absolutely beautiful so there's a red
backlit keyboard there's top mounted
speakers stereo speakers I should hope
that any notebook in 2014 would have
stereo speakers but this is the really
impressive part I've been saying for a
while Asus gaming notebooks are great
stuff like the G 750 JZ
awesome very powerful but they've really
been missing a competitor to the other
thin and light gaming notebooks this my
friends looks to be it next up
we've got a personal favorite of mine
featuring a 14-inch display that runs a
3k resolution still much higher than
1080p but maybe not quite 4k is the
razor blade 14 it features it's
ridiculous level of lighting level
customization green backlit keyboard I
think it has something like 13 levels
it's got stereo speakers core i7
quad-core processor the most impressive
thing about this notebook in my mind
though is the fact that it has a GTX 870
m in it this is one of the only I think
two products to ever win an editor's
choice from me it also features a
10-point multi-touch display and an egg
so panel so you're not gonna have to
deal with the TN rotten viewing angles
of the original blade 14 absolutely
beautiful machine but it might have a
competitor but we'll get to that in a
moment for now the GS 60 this one might
not be new either but the most
impressive thing about it aside from the
870 M quad core processor 3 K display
check out them viewing angles is the
fact that it is so incredibly light and
this I actually did up a custom chassis
for this that features a magnesium alloy
that makes it in spite of its size and
its power incredibly light to pick up it
also has a multicolor inspired by
steelseries keyboard here that you can
configure to whatever colors you want
with some breathing and wave effects and
all that kind of cool stuff with
software which leads me to the one that
really grabbed my eye this is the ARS x3
plus the plus part is the part where
it's like really kind of freaking
amazing so this is a 13-inch display
only with a 3k resolution it's got a
quad core processor it's thin and light
and all that stuff although not as late
as the GS 60 at least when you consider
the density of it but the most
impressive thing about this one is that
they've managed to pack a GTX 870 M into
this tiny little form factor they've
made some interesting tweaks to the
keyboard as well with programmable G
keys on the left side of the backlit
keyboard I'm a huge fan of the x7 I love
what they've done with that form factor
with the dual graphics cards inside that
extremely thin profile but now they've
really blown me away again with this
tiny bezel an extremely compact design
it's so compact that I turned it off by
accident
sorry about that anyway guys thanks for
checking out our overview of the 3k and
4k gaming notebooks here at the Intel
booth don't mix any of our PAX Prime
2014 coverage remember guys our trip to
the show here is powered by HyperX check
out their youtube channel youtube.com
slash kingston hyperx they've got lots
of great gaming content on there as well
as phantom glass what I personally think
is about the best screen protector you
can possibly get for your phone should
definitely check out our review of it
but basically it's just a gorilla glass
layer that you slap on top of your phone
and it has the same tactile feel as your
original Gorilla Glass foam screen
