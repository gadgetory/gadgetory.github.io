2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm guys were here in the
gigabyte component suite where they've
got all their new wears on display we
have a wall of motherboards here
unfortunately we're not going to be able
to talk about the exact details of all
of them but this is something that had
my attention drawn to it this is a
computex DNI award so that's a design
and innovation award arranged by I F
which is basically a third party saying
yes the design is good the innovation is
good and if it's anything like the
tradition we've seen before with
gigabyte it's probably true so they're
continuing with their ultra durable
design so this is ultra durable 5 plus
but we're going to focus on what
separates the different lines because
right now there is differentiation
between their gaming boards so this
particular gaming board this is the g1
sniper 5 has a completely upgraded
cooling design so it's air cooling for
the MOSFETs here or liquid cooling for
the MOSFET simply by plugging
three-eighths inch hoses into this and
you can use this with something like a
DIY all-in-one cooler such as the cooler
master iceberg for example or you can
build it into your completely custom
loop you've got some of those onboard
overclocking features things like a post
LED readout yeah you know onboard power
button so not quite to the same extent
as an overclocking centric board you've
got full support for four-way graphics
card configurations whether it's in
crossfire or sli but this is where it
really comes into its own as what makes
it gaming optimized it's got a killer
Nick Bilton and check this out they have
completely upgraded their onboard audio
solution gigabyte actually pioneered the
whole putting better onboard audio on
motherboards for crying out loud thing
with their g series that was the first
time we saw it where someone actually
went yeah we're gonna we're going to
like actually do this in a way that's
meaningful and check this out there a
ping the ante again with swappable op
amps so on all of the g1 series refresh
boards check that out swappable op amps
on the matx version swappable op amps on
the be 85 version and then swappable op
amps even on the AMD version so there's
now a g1.sniper a 85 X now I want to
talk about this one for a moment
I kind of raised an eyebrow when they
told me be 85 chipset gaming board I
went well what do you mean gaming board
gb 85 chips that you can't even
overclock and they said you know what
not all over not not all gamers
overclock some gamers want a better land
solution built into their board and a
better audio solution built into their
board and they don't want to overclock
it okay fine I get okay fair enough save
some money don't overclock get better
audio and better land solution and
swappable op-amps very nice now let's
move on to the overclocking board so
this is a very similar air / liquid
extreme heat sink design it's also got
an active fan as well as liquid cooling
Barb's but check this out this is where
the overclocking heritage really comes
in compared to gaming so rather than
having a fancy audio solution and
onboard killer networking this one has
all the onboard buttons you could want
all the onboard voltage readouts you
could want post LED readout oh cool you
can turn the PCI Express lanes on and
off this is extremely handy for
benchmarking because you don't want to
be ripping things on and off all the
time and check check this out actually
okay hold on so for way graphics card
support so that's in crossfire or sli
but let's move on to the next one so
that's the force that's a flagship board
now we've got the z87 x OC check this
out this is the kind of thing that
someone like me who tests on an open
platform all the time would love to see
built in front USB ports that you don't
have to reach around the back of the
board to get access to so this one is
more of the bare-bones nothing extra
purist overclocking board whereas the
force is more of a generally flagship
board in general moving on we've got the
ultra durable series so this one right
here again you find features that aren't
necessarily relevant to gamers or to
overclockers things like Thunderbolt but
this is also a very high-end board in
its own right you're going to be able to
run for way crossfire 4-way SLI you've
got all of those built-in overclocking
features all that cool stuff but just to
not quite the same sort of degree of
optimization for these particular uses
that the other two boards are now let's
move all the way down over to the very
end here where we've got em this guy
right here z87 and Wi-Fi so there's a
z87 MITx board this is performance
optimized you're going to be able to
overclock on it which is very very cool
but
right over here they've asked me to draw
attention to this board there's now an
FM to IT export from gigabyte and what's
cool about this one is it's using the
same voltage delivery components as you
find on the OC class boards this board
under liquid nitrogen has actually been
up to what did what did they say 5.8
gigahertz or something ridiculous like
that with an FM to CPU so very very cool
stuff let's move on to graphics cards
correction that was 6.7 gigahertz
overclock on this particular board using
liquid nitrogen also it supports AMD's
wireless display and maybe we shouldn't
move on to graphics cards just yet
because there's a couple cool things
over here that they have on display in
the suite so this is related to the
overclocking board as well as the gaming
board so they've got a blown-up version
of all the overclocking buttons and
pretty much everything you can do with
them everything from debug display to CP
ratio up and down to changing your
multiplier up and down so you can switch
to single BIOS mode dual BIOS mode dip
switch all this stuff is built right
into the board and this is kind of a
cool button you can press this button
but I don't think it actually does
anything but don't worry on the
motherboard it will and then this one
right here they're showing off what
makes the gaming boards gaming so that's
the upgradable op amp which we talked
about before all right I'll check that
out hehe that's hilarious I love it
uh-huh as well as the dedicated audio
zone on the PCB but we've been seeing
this for a while from gigabyte and then
here they have a pretty cool demo of the
of the liquid cooling hybrid solution
that's uh that you can hook up on these
boards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
