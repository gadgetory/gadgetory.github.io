unboxing the ocz vertex series 60 gig
drive now ocz has about a million and
one different SSD drives but the vertex
series was their first one to really
take off because unlike the old jay
micron based ones you don't get any
stuttering issues with these because
they do feature and in the links
controller so what that means is that
you always get the best performance
possible from your SSD drive even when
you're undergoing a lot of random write
operations which for what the earlier
SSDs suffered on now there's a couple
different versions of the vertex one of
which is a turbo version and that's
basically a slightly faster clocked into
links controller and then it also comes
in a bunch of different capacities so I
have the 60 gig one today now the 30 gig
in the 60 gig drive both have a 64 Meg
cash as opposed to the 128 bank cash on
the 128 and the 250 gig drives and they
also have slightly lower specs in terms
of reading right so the reeds on this
are up to 230 megabytes per second and
up to 135 megabytes per second for the
rights now that is not actually the
important thing for an SSD Drive the
important thing is something that you
don't see on a spec sheet and that is
the random write and random read
performance so you'll have to check
benchmarks for that because surprisingly
they don't come expect for it but anyway
let's find out what you get inside the
box here so first of all you get an
installation guide and warranty info so
this has a to do to do to do to do to do
to do I believe it's a two-year warranty
it could be a three-year warranty Wow it
doesn't even say how long the warranty
is on oh oh one year one year warranty
only okay well there we go two and a
half inch solid state drive one year
warranty and then we open it up to find
the drive itself embedded in a nice
little phone there let's get it right
side up so it comes in a little
anti-static baggie okay so let's take
the drive itself oh now most of the in
the link series our into links
controller drives on the market come
with these kind of metallic casings but
the ocz drives come look like a matte
black finish on them
I actually really like so at the back of
the drive you'll find a standard SATA
power and theta2 data there's a jumper
there I believe that's only for
diagnostic purposes or it might take it
back to say 21 compatibility not one
hundred percent sure but on the bottom
of the drive you will find for mounting
holes so this is useful if you're using
the vertex in a laptop sort of
configuration which is highly
recommended because an SSD is the best
thing you can do for your computer's
performance it's better even than a ram
upgrade at a certain level or even CPU
and then on the sides of the drive
you've got one two three four more
mounting adapters or mounting holes and
you can use that to mount to either to
an adapter or to a desktop configuration
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing oh oh no no I almost forgot
okay the biggest thing about the vertex
series is that they already support trim
so trim is that feature of Windows 7
that allows you to not have the
performance degradation that you see
with almost every other SSD Drive on the
market so it means that your drive
always performs at about 99% of new
performance you need to make sure you
update to the latest firmware but if you
get a vertex drive you do get trim
support thank you for checking out my
video blog on the vertex 60 gig</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
