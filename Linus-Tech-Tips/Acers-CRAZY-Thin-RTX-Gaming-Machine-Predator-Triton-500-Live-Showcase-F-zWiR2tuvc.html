straight-up unboxing of a gaming laptop
this is actually gonna be a little fun
because this video is a bit different
than usual so it's sponsored by Acer
we're going to be over viewing the
predator Triton 500 gaming notebook but
boy what's all this then mate
hey we're also going to be trying to win
an apex legends match and I have
equipped myself with the best possible
gear are you guys gear you know what
let's do that let's do the notebook
first and then we'll we'll talk about
exactly what the plan is for winning we
got we got one shot one opportunity
mom's sphaghetti guys we got this all
right okay all right let's open this
thing up so what's special about the
predator training 500 is that unlike
most other gaming laptops on the market
it is both extremely powerful and
extremely thin so it can be equipped
with anything from an RT X 20 60 all the
way up to an RT X 20 80 max Q so that
means full fat support for in videos
rate racing technology and supportive
titles it's got an 87 50 h6 core mobile
processor and the particular SKU that
we've got here today I believe has 16
gigs of DDR 4 memory although I'm gonna
have to double check that and whoo
alright there's some other crazy stuff
too it's got a 144 Hertz display so that
means that you're going to get refreshes
to your eyeballs as much as twice as
fast actually even potentially more than
twice as fast as the plebs that are
relying on 60 Hertz displays and it does
all this while being extraordinarily
thin so let's go ahead and open this
puppy up there it is man I am like so
rusty on doing like like just straight
unboxings alright so on the bottom we've
got lots of ventilation one of the
things
that acer has added this time as they've
got these super thin metal fan blades
that they claim gives them up to 40%
more airflow and when you're trying to
pack RTX graphics and a six core
processor into something this thin
that's obviously fairly important also
visible from the outside is all the
actual business end of the cooling so
right here we've got one radiator two
radiators three and four so this machine
actually pulls in air across almost the
entire bottom here and exhausts it out
to vents at the back and two at the side
and that's gonna be something you're not
gonna want to interfere with and get
anything in the way of those or you're
going to have a fairly bad time also in
terms of I oh man I think we are
reaching the limit for how thin like a
real no compromises gaming machine can
be because you've got your power in okay
that we could probably make a little bit
thinner we've got our HDMI out headphone
microphone USB check that out I don't
know how they could possibly make this
notebook any thinner and still maintain
a full sized rj45 Ethernet jack that is
pretty darn impressive over on the other
side we've got two more USB type says--
mini DisplayPort what you don't see on
that many machines these days but I
actually still like to see for a couple
of reasons as well as Thunderbolt 3 so
between these two what's cool is you can
do two DisplayPort outs and one HDMI for
a total of up to three 4k displays
pretty freakin sick also if you use the
display port or the Thunderbolt this one
has support for desync now this
particular SKU doesn't have G sync on
the built-in display
it's just 144 Hertz but they actually do
have a couple that are available with
that option let's go ahead and get
plugged in here actually I might as well
just start getting set up and I can
start talking about what our plan is so
in order to give ourselves the best
chance of winning an apex legends match
just first attempt first attempt right
guys like we're not trying twice that's
it
one try one try edy my understanding is
you actually won your warm-up match is
that right ten kills all right good so
so that's the plan yes we have fantastic
gear in order to get the job done but I
have partnered up with people who under
normal circumstances if I wasn't paying
them definitely would not even begin to
consider gaming with me in a competitive
game are you guys even playing on like
your real accounts and stuff too oh all
right well I thought maybe you would be
but apparently I thought wrong
ouch really you don't think you can you
think I'm that bad that you wouldn't
even trust yourselves to carry me on
your real accounts all right okay fine I
kind of accept that all right I'm gonna
fire in I'm gonna oh I'm feeling very
disheartened right now
okay I'm gonna fire up the machine here
we've already got all the windows set up
done so we might as well just kind of
poke around and see what we can do so
there's a couple of interesting buttons
here on the keyboard other than kind of
your standard ones one of them right
here so uh these laptops are actually
overclockable so I wouldn't necessarily
count on getting a ton of headroom out
of the you know
RTX 20 80 with max Q design one or
anything like that the thing is that
invidious last few generations of cards
really rely heavily on thermals in order
to get their best performance and so
with this one though with a 2060
I would expect to actually be able to
get a little bit more out of it oh did I
miss something yeah oh thanks Anthony
this is so we can capture my display
sweet so you've got your OneTouch turbo
over here so that's on evidently now I
actually have like I haven't used this
before or you've got the predator button
over here which brings up there which
brings up their dashboard this is good
okay I heard the fans kick in so I'm
apparently gonna be running with an
overclocked GPU
we can't tell what it's actually gonna
run at because this is while we're
idling and then my fan control is at max
I will say though even if max fan speed
like its to be clear I can hear it
perfectly well but it's not super
annoying or anything like that it's
gonna grab a pair of headphones here
because I didn't get prepared ahead of
time like these guys alright
so we're not gonna bother with
microphones right guys we're just gonna
like yell at each other across the room
really you need a microphone to sit in
the set and why are you so a social come
on come on who even needs in-game audio
anyway people who knew him yeah well III
see I see the way you're gonna be about
this a couple of other things that are
notable about this machine so keyboard
actually we've I mean we've talked about
the previous generation triton 500 I
actually really like it it manages to be
super thin without doing any of the kind
of weird stuff like you know positioning
the touchpad over here or the keyboard
down here anything like that it feels
just like a normal laptop nice thin
bezels but still with a webcam up here
instead of down here nice thin body but
without moving anything around in a in a
weird manner and of course basically
tops back I mean okay technically intel
announced eight core mobile processors
what was that yesterday or Wednesday
Wednesday I think but uh yeah give him
time give him give him time my friends
all right look at this so not only that
but our chip is actually turbo Eng up to
around 3.9 gigahertz pretty nice okay
tweedledum six nine eight eight has
invited you to play apex legends is that
have you guys just been spamming that
and waiting for me to finally notice it
because I heard it a couple times but I
didn't actually see it alright
all right oh that's pretty loud one sec
just find my volume down wow you do not
sound great ed so what's that
yeah it's that's that's pretty bad
not not super impressed okay so I'm
Master LM g1 and you guys are Tweedledee
and Tweedledum so I guess the the idea
before I went and took the lid off of
this was that we were gonna pretend that
I'm good and that somehow I won based on
my own merits rather than just being
carried by you guys so for those of you
don't know that's Edie he's been with
LMG since the beginning actually he used
to be a video editor here and camera
operator I don't think he's touched a
camera in like four years and I don't
think he's touched a premiere timeline
in like one actually technically he does
once in awhile we just don't like it
when he does anymore
and then David joined us you've been
here like six months now eight months
holy crap
so yeah his credentials were that he
like sort of knows how to use a camera
and that he is like wicked crazy good at
video games so if I ever needed someone
to help me out he'd have me he'd have me
all set up so are we are we almost ready
to start here guys all right cool let me
just see if there's anything that I'm
supposed to tell you guys for for a sirs
whole thing
what's that Anthony yeah
windows audio settings yeah yeah sounds
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that all look
good shweet yes this guy just because I
suck at games doesn't mean that I suck
at knowing if my monitor is running at a
high refresh rate it makes such a big
difference like you can tell immediately
when you sit down at a machine that's
running a high refresh rate display all
right so uh I just went ready up then I
don't have video games work this is the
one where you slide around on the ground
with control right okay cool got this
press you to pick things up all right
yeah yeah I've played this before okay
can you guys not patronize me oh yeah
actually one other feature that I was
supposed to go over with you guys is it
has killer doubleshot networking so that
means that in theory assuming
everything's going according to plan if
you're plugged into wired and wireless
oh no I'm plugged into wireless what a
chump
speaking of knowing how to configure
things correctly oh no there's no
network cable here yes thank you oh that
was plugged into the back of the system
yeah yeah we got you we got - no problem
yeah speaking of not knowing how to
configure a gaming system so the idea is
if you've got both of them connected
it'll send all of your game data down
the wire and then any like stupid
windows you know malware executable or
any like background nonsense it'll do
that over wireless so that you don't get
any interference with your with your
wired data stream okay yeah let's just
go without mic you got this I mean can
you guys not hear me I'm pretty loud
yeah hi
heck yeah so you guys just have to yell
like get into it Oh connectivity to
server time do't all that's probably cuz
I switched over to Wired sorry guys
wired to friends in Apex oh oh crap no
no hold on I think you guys can invite
me again hey oh you've got to be kidding
me
it says press Y to accept and if you
click on the why it doesn't accept it
can you try again like how is that even
a thing see and it like you look at
highlights and everything look see if
you actually have to press what I mean
yeah RTM I get it I didn't follow the
instructions or whatever but still okay
I'm ready to go alright wish us luck
guys this is if I do win this will be my
first apex win although I have one table
G a couple of times I was also carried
those times I played with Luke and he's
quite a lot better than me but not as
good as n so I'm feeling good on my
chances I have never actually know I've
played games with you before yeah never
anything modern though yeah yeah he's
pretty good he's pretty good at those
games and also I'm pretty sure I
actually beat you okay so if we're
talking just like pure skill because I
mean this is all like you know knowing
what a mo goes with what gun really I
mean you know if you want to talk pure
skill game I don't think it gets any
more real than quake 3 just you know I'm
just just saying oh yeah it would be a
total wasted opportunity if I didn't
tell you guys over on LTT store comm
we're taking pre-orders for the shipment
of these that's arriving in I think
three weeks they have sold vastly beyond
our expectations
oh no someone took the medic chick
that's what I was gonna do what do I
pick what do I pick quick don't take all
right okay good
anyway so we've got some more coming in
three weeks we've placed another order
already but those are at least two
months out we think so if you want one
of these LT t store comm they're like
freaking awesome so many people internal
you're like I want one we're like no you
actually may not
one until uh until all the the customer
orders are fulfilled so mm-hmm crap I'm
either left control to relinquish
jumpmaster
left control the relinquish please okay
no no no no we don't want me to be the
jumpmaster I'm not I'm not who's
jumpmaster
I don't know no let's play it for real
play for real where are we going
are you good okay does anyone else here
I don't see anyone else coming down okay
all right oh we're playing only a 60
person game or wait is Apex legends only
60 okay no no I need stuff why you gotta
be like that no I want this stuff your
stuff seems pretty good
I have nothing well I didn't know what
way he was gonna go yeah and I have not
picked up anything good yet you guys are
mean oh I got armor neat yeah I still
don't have an actual weapon I have one
grenade so that'll be my entire
contribution no no that's fine I got a
weapon all right man I wish you guys the
very best of luck here I just have no
idea what any of the stuff I'm picking
up is I don't even know where you guys
are
oh you're 63 meters away oh how do I get
out of here yeah I I know I went
upstairs
why are you guys so mean odd in this
game do you have to run to runner does
it just right it doesn't seem like it's
making a difference yeah I know it's
control i I just it doesn't seem like
I'm going any faster when I hold shift
do you run faster with a smaller gun
yeah it doesn't seem to make much of a
difference wow what a jerk oh shoot I
just put down my rifle I would like to
have that back okay oh you guys are so
far out ahead of me I don't even know
what any of this stuff I'm picking up is
how do you how do you how do you put
cool stuff on your gun I want like a
cool gun does it just automatically go
on if it's fits on it okay this stuff is
barrel stabilizer does this okay there's
nothing you don't want okay holy crap
you guys are so far away you took a zip
line yeah you know you had all these
concerns about you know the microphone
and everything you're not even saying
what's going on so it's not like that
would have been helpful okay
oh okay so who's Tweedledee and who's
Tweedledum okay all right all right all
right I just picked up a thing I don't
know what it is
no alternator SMG do I want to ask them
to your pistol I'm gonna take that okay
okay and I have ammo so okay
yeah I'm really not looking that closely
at these things barrel stabilizer okay
getting all anxious so there's only ten
squads left how do you see the map in
this game never mind I figured it out
holy crap we are way outside of the
thing do we need to do we need to deal
with that at some point though okay
where do I go
where's head oh crap yeah I left all
right I will come back so you can't just
reverse your zip line yeah I'm not gonna
try that okay I have a pretty crappy
sight I'm gonna have to try and find a
better site I think that would be okay
there's only eight squads left you guys
so just by like hiding away we could
just win right nice
wait am I being attacked No yeah I'm
coming
it's just I'm very very far behind you
yeah okay just very far how about that
okay so then I equip it okay okay so I'm
gonna get some more ammo
uh-huh uh-huh which one
okay all right all right see this is
what I need in order to be good at games
I just need people who know what they're
doing I think they did they helped me
okay
I'm gonna go get a site so that sites
really good okay okay so we should we
should try to like at least sort of move
in the right direction maybe okay yeah
oh there's the there's the me map cool
I'm just gonna put away my gun because
let's face it that wasn't gonna be
useful anyway
I have no idea what people are saying in
YouTube chat right now or floatplane
chat I didn't think to get that set up
before we started I really should have
I'm just gonna have a look people are
probably like well he sucks just wait
I'm thanks Anthony that's real
constructive okay you guys don't know
that for sure I might actually be decent
you never know exactly exactly
people are saying lioness you're killing
me exactly see that's what skill you
know ah
get back in the ring it says you can't
fight if you're not in the ring uh what
the heck guys why did we cut this so
close okay cuz like if see it just seems
unnecessary like was I did I not say oh
hey maybe we should probably go towards
the thing you're still leading okay me
no I don't have a gun equipped right now
guys we're taking damage oh we're almost
back in the ring all right fine
okay okay
damn coming
that just seemed totally unnecessary
what did I punch
okay so I just stand here all right okay
so what's our plan there's only five
squads left Who am I following you guys
are splitting up
well I don't know Weedle dumb took off
my crouched is that the problem no okay
nevermind I was just on weird uneven
terrain
okay I got this guys I'm not dying no
it's the chat
okay so just wandering around in the
open like this this is a good good
tactic right okay so we're heading
towards the the next circle closure okay
so I need a helmet at some point right
okay
I could just not get hit in the head
seems like a good strat okay so we're
looking into the circle right now
there's presumably like people down
there oh yeah I see some nope I lied it
was it was it was a it was a dust bunny
oh cool okay well that's gonna be my job
to see if I see enemies and then you
guys you guys do the trigger pulling
okay whatever no I know you're pretty
good oh that was where I thought I saw
people okay cool um the boats gonna land
there's a boat oh okay so if I wanted oh
I felt oh yeah okay
oh yeah okay so you guys see these guys
right I think they're fighting yeah yeah
yeah so we're just gonna let them fight
okay cool this really does seem like the
kind of wimpy way to win this game
though okay
like there's nothing really royale or
battle about it it's just it's like
Heidi Heidi Royale I want to shoot
people and win
they can't have both people are telling
me to press Q to detect enemies is there
any truth to that or is Q for quit
okay I could use a helmet oh okay I'll
go get it
nice okay
four squads left shut up so rude alright
I'm still way behind you guys oh okay so
that's good but they're gonna start
heading over here and they're gonna see
us wait we're hiding um okay so wait how
long does it take the drop to arrive
okay
Wow oh okay that was the drop so I'm
gonna get sniped right okay a Phoenix
KITT what's a Phoenix KITT dude just you
guys take good stuff right side okay I'm
just gonna come back up to you Ed oh
crap ah did it that's it
over there yeah I just pinged um ah man
I want to get up have crap Yap they're
shooting at me
okay hold on hold on I'm good I still
can't see them
so I'm following you guys okay three
squads left are we one of them or does
that mean three more okay I don't know
what that means
okay I don't know how to drop things
thermite grenade yeah yeah I'm not
realistically gonna use it and I have
four of them I am taking the Phoenix kid
okay
you guys are so far ahead I'm gonna die
oh so when there's three squads left it
doesn't tell you how many people that is
wait do I have to go out and around here
okay cool
all right we got this right okay
see it's
okay so we have to play fight a fight
here okay that's fine got this I should
look at the map neat oh oh wow it's a
toggle you don't hold it okay cool so I
just follow you guys or take up a
different position or okay sure
I can do that I will watch our but I
will be the butt watcher on the team the
blood watcher the patois sure
that's how you win okay I'm still
watching our butt so if I see someone
don't fire them okay just hide full hide
yeah yeah if they shoot I shoot back yes
yes yes yes so wait are we had any risk
of getting the circle oh crap I had my
nap open not good and I'm done I'm
crawling I'm calling I'm calling I'm
calling they are shooting me I'm dead
dang it hey I can still win really
seriously
alright okay this seems like a tactical
error like this is not what you would
normally do right so I'm on a ship right
now so what do I do I just jump out of
it
oh wait so I have no weapons
this seems okay I don't have a weapon
but I can hey wait where are you guys
are we dead okay I think yeah okay I'm
gonna melee um how do you mean lay yeah
where are you where you went
what's up now
[Laughter]
all right well it goes to show you that
even with the finest equipment and the
finest teammates you can still lose
pretty spectacularly if you're just
honestly not that great at video games
with that said I dealt more damage than
Tweedledum just saying and survived
longer and got the same number of kills
so so that's a thing that happened yeah
thank you guys for making me feel very
middle of the road today um while we're
at it
thanks JJ for sponsoring today's video
we'll see you guys on land show in about
two and a half hours here oh man you
guys tried you guys tried you behave
we're number 200 right how do I see
super Jets I don't think I have any way
of doing this just on like the mobile
app here ah okay okay I'm gonna go over
to Anthony cuz I should probably respond
to some oh you've got some there oh
thank you John lost the game
yeah thanks cells David I'm gonna get
sniped right yeah
love you Linus but you suck at video
games as Kyle Jason age says MLG K
Swagger's yes Oh compensation for the
team about to carry you they get paid
alright probably too well given they
didn't manage to give me a victory today
