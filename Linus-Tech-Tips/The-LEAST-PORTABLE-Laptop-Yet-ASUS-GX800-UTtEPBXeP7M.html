check them out at the link in the video
description so I have to give a soos
credit for this they along with everyone
else and their dogs built a laptop that
is by any reasonable account not really
very portable this is the GX 800 but a
sous they thought gee how are people
going to move this and they created the
choice of Champions rolling luggage
which lets you put your external water
cooling solution for your GX 800 laptop
into a convenient leak area below
rollable carton that you can bring
around with you wherever it is that you
want to take this device now they also
thought of this unlike some of the other
ones we've checked out
Asus lets you actually disconnect the
laptop itself oh do I have to wait a
minute just pull up there we go oh look
at that
from the dock that contains two 120
millimeter water cooling radiators a
bunch of LEDs a bunch of tubing a pump a
power input which I'll explain a little
bit more later and finally check that
out oh look at that look at that sliding
action right there right there is to
quick disconnect fittings that actually
come off of the water cooling pipes that
are inside the laptop here to handle
cooling the CPU and GPU letting it run
standalone it's an 18 point no 18 inch
display 4k so and I believe that is
that's an IPS display looking good you
guys I'm liking it in terms of i/o you
get SD you get 2 USB 3s and this is a
funny one they have a little spot for an
external antenna
according to Asus you don't have to use
it again it's all about the options you
can plug an external antenna and put it
like somewhere else and you will get
significantly improved Wireless perform
it's pretty cool have to try it for
myself but I plan to they're going to be
sending one of these over right here
have created one of the most custom
power plugs I've ever seen this is
connected to a 330 watt power brick that
is under the table here and the reason
that you need that and the second one
that goes into the docking station is
that the hardware inside this baby is
unreal first though Gigabit LAN HDMI
mini DisplayPort SuperSpeed type C
Thunderbolt type C more USB 3 and
dedicated microphone and headphone jacks
so inside here is a core i7 7820 HQ
that's an overclockable skew 64 gigs of
ram one terabyte of raid 0 nvme storage
you got an additional bay for a two and
a half inch drive some of these specs
might be subject to change especially
storage and RAM depending on the region
because that's how these guys roll and
you've also got two gtx 1080s running in
sli so you get much of the performance
with a single cable an option that most
other SLI 1080 notebooks do not provide
where they just have like a like a weird
adapter and I don't know how they behave
if you plug only one cable in and then
you get full unrestricted performance if
you plug in both a bunch of other
high-end stuff on this guy you've got a
full individually backlit RGB keyboard
as well as three different profiles so
you can save all your macros save all
your color schemes and all that good
stuff and I guess Jean what else would I
even really say about it other than this
thing is this thing is banaynays I mean
look at that interface at the back
there's that power that custom power
ring thing they got going on there's the
guides there's the the quick disconnects
which by the way only leave a mild
dampness on either side so you can
unplug and plug it in many many times
over so there you have it it's heavy but
it's powerful and from my experience
with it so far it's actually quite quiet
and it can be air or water cooled that's
right my arms tired
