enough
this is the lynx SPL sk 400 this is a
power line kit that not only
communicates but also acts as a well
yeah okay so this is a 200 megabit per
second powerline kit which is adequate
for you know probably a single HD stream
and then some additional you know
surfing traffic and whatnot so what's
most interesting about this particular
kit is what you're gonna see on the
bottoms on the bottom of one of the
adapters so we've got the one adapter
here this is a pretty normal looking
powerline adapter what I do like about
it is that it plugs directly into the
wall some of them are more for
positioning away from the wall and well
that's good from a heat dissipation
perspective it's not necessarily great
from a convenience and site leanness I
don't know I don't know if sightly is
something you can say it you could say
unsightly but yeah I'm not really sure
sorry from that perspective yeah so it
plugs in directly into the wall okay
you've got your standbys reset button
right here on the other side you've got
your link button so you can get it to
communicate and link up with everything
all the other powerline devices in your
house that are compatible we've got one
network port here we've got ventilation
holes looks like a standard para adapter
now look at this one
uh-huh this one's actually a little bit
bigger look at that it's significantly
bigger okay we've got all of our
indicators here including the computer
activity led the home activity LED as
well as the power LED same buttons
except on the side this time instead of
one of them being on the bottom and on
the bottom huh 1 2 3 4 so what is this
good for what is special about the PLS
k400 what's special about it is you take
this guy you plug it in next to your
router you plug your router into it now
your power lines in your house are
networking enabled and then you take
this guy and you put it somewhere where
you have a whole bunch of devices so
what this does is this these are all 10
100 ports and it
acts as a as a switch so what that means
is if you throw one of these in your
media center you plug in your ps3 and
your Xbox and Media PC and your okay
let's say you only have one console
sorry sorry back up back up okay so you
plug in your Xbox you plug in your media
PC you plug in your TV to deliver
firmware updates and whatnots or
whatever else and then you got one more
and you plug in oh I had another thing I
wanted to plug in but not forgotten
ah your network media player there
that's so you put all of these guys in
here
now they're all able to communicate via
powerline with your router and you don't
have to have an actual switch plugged in
behind your media center so it's just a
cleaner way to set up the network in
your household with powerline rather
than breaking this out into a switch and
then running everything all over the
place that's pretty much it so thank you
for checking out my unboxing at the PLS
k400 don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and don't forget
powerline is awesome if you're not using
powerline in your house you should use
powerline in your house because it's
really easy to set up it's much faster
and more reliable than Wireless and
unlike Wireless it is really good get
these or other powerline or these power
lines awesome you should have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
