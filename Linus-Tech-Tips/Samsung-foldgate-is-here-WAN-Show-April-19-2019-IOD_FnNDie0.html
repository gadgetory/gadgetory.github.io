got a great show in store for you today
I hope and of course the main topic of
conversation has got to be Galaxy folds
they're breaking we wouldn't know we
don't have one and the soonest I might
be able to get my hands on a galaxy fold
is probably the week after next but hey
for everyone who has a Samsung USP our
contact it doesn't seem like they're
really getting a much better experience
than I am anyway we've got that we've
got Sony internally regulating the
sexual content in their games and UK
wants to ban the like button which is
which is great also facial recognition
to become a standard in which US
airports backup which is great oh yeah
well we're gonna have a real
conversation about that I think won't we
first let's go ahead roll the intro
slice cracks his knuckles let's go we
all know how that will actually hold on
a second you might not be able to bring
yourself to hit me no I might win yeah
you know actually I was thinking about
this right right before we actually
started talking you were thinking about
fighting I was thinking we haven't had a
wine show since the roast
oh we had last time you and I were on
the way and sure together was broast day
yeah I hosted without you then you
hosted without me oh that's hilarious
yeah so that's not related that's not
related at all we actually had a blast
at the roast yeah oh I'm gonna frame
anyway anyway we have a new we have a
new year's resolution for for wine show
it's a new year somewhere we are going
to do like a little bit of news before
we get into just biessing so if you want
to talk about the roast no but why don't
we get straight into the galaxy fold
screens breaking so thank you blade of
grass for posting on the forum in
summary what's going on is for those who
have not seen it in the news quite
literally everywhere what's going on is
Samsung is shipping their first ever
device with a folding screen so it's the
Galaxy fold and review units went out
probably I guess just under a week ago
which is kind of remarkable especially
considering how many of the people who
have review units have had them break or
otherwise no longer work so far kind of
surprised I didn't catch this so there's
a couple sort of controversy there's a
couple sub controversies here one of
them is that the Galaxy fold has a
screen protector on it that looks an
awful lot like those things you're
supposed to you know peel off but if you
consult the manual actually it's
specified that you are not supposed to
remove it because it can make it more
prone to failure now a couple of the
people who have had their galaxy folds
break including marques mkbhd and Mark
Garmin of Bloomberg
did pull it off because they thought it
was just a screen cover not an
especially your part of the display
you're reviewing these things all the
time it starts to become like oh you you
notice something on screen okay well you
remove that that's routine and I've seen
I've seen some criticism particularly
aimed towards Marquez over his
assumption that he should just remove it
but honestly I felt like it was kind of
unfair they were like well if you read
the manual then you would know not to
remove it and to me in read the EULA
yeah exactly to me if something is not
seamless on the front of a display like
if it is not clearly fused to the front
of the glass then I I don't think it's
unreasonable to expect that someone
might remove it in fact in many years of
habit forming - exactly that and there's
many phones that come with screen
protectors even are quite permanently
applied like oneplus ships the screen
protector on their phones but that are
entirely optional so it's the kind of
thing that knowing this and surely
Samsung must know this they would have
thought to put like a gigantic warning
on it yeah like a separate peelable one
I actually I actually damaged a phone
screen once I forget what phone it was
but it had kind of an anti-glare coating
on the front of it like scratch that
went not quite to the edges I picked it
a little bit I went oh crap this isn't
supposed to come on yeah that's quite a
while ago but that definitely used to be
a problem yeah and like most Eve even in
the PC space much more niche and usually
have more enthusiastic us tumors there's
parts that you'll get that will have
covers over things telling you make sure
you do this thing but like like socket
covers usually have information on the
socket covers where you open it certain
power supplies will have like a cover
for the plug to do something for exactly
or like if you buy an all in or excuse
me an all-in-one a prebuilt PC from
someone like an I buy power typically
they'll have a cover over the over the
plug at the back that says yo open up
the case and take out the packing
materials before you plug this thing in
like you can't assume that the user is
going to read the manual unfortunately s
actually for something that we all feel
like we understand pretty well yeah like
a cell phone yeah
now the thing is that even some of the
phones that did not have their
protective covers peeled off have also
died so dieter from the verge got a
bulge under the screen somehow and it
eventually died and then Steve Kovac
from CNBC his died unknown cause of
death now here's the thing that's really
scary about this for me Samsung says
they're still gonna sell the fold but
what's crazy is like yes there's a lot
of review units out there it wouldn't
surprise me if Samsung has shipped
somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 to
a thousand review units but what I also
know based on the fact that I don't have
one is that there's not that many out
there and they also failed really fast
so Samsung showed that they that they
test the Galaxy fold to be folded and
unfolded I forget how many times fifteen
fifteen thousand times or something I
can't remember what the number was it
was more than fifteen hundred I'm sorry
it was it was obscenely high I'm sure a
chat is already very high number that
includes a 15 what there's there's
problems with those tests though that
are fairly well known that it's
extremely uniform how those things
happen and they keep adding the problem
yeah they can try to you can try to add
randomness to it and there's there's
better ones for for different
applications but but like those tests
are definitely not perfect well that's
the problem far from they are perfect
it's a machine
oh yeah no well yeah holding it evenly
it's too perfect perfectly closing it
and unfolding it and then you've already
got people doing first impressions
videos talking about how satisfying the
snap is I mean think back to flip phones
how did you flip open your phone did you
flip it open like this or did you flip
it open a little more something like
this yeah I wouldn't try to shove my
thumb in there if I could but it was
mostly a fluke I mean it was called a
flip not a prideful e apart as far away
from the hinges
possible applying pressure evenly to
both sides of the screen yeah yeah and
you gotta assume a zero you're holding
it improperly problems in the world real
people are gonna use it like real people
200,000 times apparently 200,000 folds
okay YouTube chat is saying thank you
guys very much appreciate that
but the thing is that two hundred
thousand perfect folds that does test
maybe the resilience of the the
reinforcements they've done to the
crease but that doesn't test the way it
handles if someone like just grabs the
top of it and and it puts uneven
pressure on one side you can get way
more so and it think about it you went
to school right learned about levers
right
how much more force can you apply with a
lever compared to just with your own
bare hands directly on some object X a
lot more and when you twist you are
effectively using the phone as a liver
to break itself whatever what am I even
talking about so uh all right the review
units did not have a warning on the Box
cautioning users leave it on Samsung
does say future customers will be warned
Oh an issue I have is like in some of
the pictures that I've seen yeah
looks I haven't held one because we
don't have one so I don't know but it
looks like it would be very likely
especially with the device that's going
to even partially fold yeah for someone
to have an accident where that thing
gets pushed or peeled or pried off
unintentionally like this if if it's
that flimsy to the point where people
were super easily just able to flip it's
gonna be a huge problem yeah because
there's gonna be people that actually
don't even read a warning that's right
on the thing like you know that oh yeah
that'll happen to so if I had to guess
this is a $2,000 device now we know that
the CPU doesn't cost two thousand
dollars it's the same as you'd get in in
a flagship Galaxy S series phone like
there's there's nothing inherently
special about this thing other than well
the Rd yeah the tooling and the screen
and even the most expensive phone
screens I remember being blown away when
I was like really it's like 23 dollars
to replace an iPhone screen like they're
small they're actually there's materials
to them once you learn how to make them
and once the yields are decent they
aren't actually that expensive now the
yields probably suck on these but that's
a whole other conversation so is their
battery on the other side and stuff like
I'm assuming they filled this yeah
assuming they feel that like there's
probably a little bit more mass but it's
not gonna total you don't quote me on
that the point is yeah there's not it's
not like it has a freaking you know
Geiger counter and like you know
altimeter and like like a bunch of like
stuff crammed into it it's just got a
bigger screen and it folds so if I had
to guess I would say it cost $2000
because a the yields are low on the
screen be the Rd was really high for
something they don't think they're gonna
sell that many of or maybe don't want to
sell that many of so I think the $2,000
price is designed to prevent yeah too
many people from buying it for one thing
and to cover the costs of what they
already know are going to be fairly
frequent RMA's I think we somewhat said
this and we like first heard about this
one win and I think this is more
reassurance of that idea what the prot
this also what the price also does is it
filters out the kinds of customers that
are going to be able to afford it to be
only the ones that could then also
afford if it breaks three months out of
warranty you know how a year and a half
from now to just get a new phone
whatever it's a $2,000 phone this is
this says anyone who is a normal human
being who is it outraged by this phone
breaking I feel like you're sort of
missing the forest for the trees here
because it won't affect you you're not
buying it
I wouldn't buy it yeah would you buy it
no like to me honestly once you get past
the point of like 400 to 600 dollars you
need to have a pretty compelling
argument for why I should why I should
take this thing especially now that
phones are such incremental year by year
upgrades and buying a last gen phone is
like actually such a good value
proposition exactly so yeah it's a
product that's designed for
early adopters who don't care about
money so with that in mind do I think
that them breaking is a problem actually
no do you think that them breaking at
this kind of a rate let's say
hypothetically I think actually five
hundred to a thousand review units was
probably aggressive let's say there's
probably somewhere in the neighborhood
of like two hundred out there right now
do you think four out of two hundred
remembering that that's only a two
percent failure rate do you think this
is a nothing burger what they say in a
week so yeah so I'm gonna I'm gonna
start this with a story I knew a guy at
one point in time that you actually know
but I'm not gonna name o that I went to
school with and he was extraordinarily
wealthy at the time and in the course of
a few months
he broke I think it was like three
iPhones just I am a little tipsy coming
back to dorms drop iPhone hahaha get new
one okay didn't really bother him so
maybe not that big of an issue cuz they
could just swap them out I don't know at
a certain level I don't know how much it
actually matters if we ignore that whole
concept I think it's a problem that
they're going to wantedly fail within a
week but like I don't think this is a
game breaker for the people making that
type of a decision for the reasons that
I just stated right if you're spending
two grand on a phone that you know has a
high probability of breaking and that
you know doesn't really have probably a
super major value proposition for you
I'm super experimental it's probably not
the biggest deal I do think it's a
problem but I don't think it's a I think
they'll still sell the phones to the
people that they wanted to sell the
phones to if that makes sense
we've got people talking about that they
think Huawei's mate x is going to be a
much better implementation and I'm gonna
kind of jump in and say you know what I
doubt it
I suspect that like so many things this
is just the race to be the first one and
it's it's got it's got that smell of you
know first gen
experiments you know should have been a
death kit you know like the first
generation Apple watch where the battery
life was terrible it had all kinds of
other issues Apple so quickly deprecated
that thing they didn't even cook they
don't even acknowledge it by giving it
like Apple watch gen1 status it's like
gen zero like that that is absolutely
their own way of denoting that product
these things happen and I think that as
consumers if we are if we're paying
attention it should be pretty clear that
they're happening so they shouldn't
really happen to us so yeah I don't I
don't think the made X is gonna be
particularly better so now having
experienced one folding phone at CES
yeah I've noticed for having extreme
issues I don't really know it's
definitely not just fooling oh
interesting it's all platforms for sure
a video output low it's not receiving
enough video to maintain smooth
streaming as such all viewers viewers
will experience buffering what that's an
interestingly it looks like ouputs 7,500
yep
I don't see any dropped frames or
anything all right we're gonna have to
power on here anyway keep cruising on
yeah so yeah having seen that one at CES
having seen at least second hand what's
going on with the galaxy fold it's just
it's just a super super early product I
think folding phones are going to be a
super big deal they're not right now
like you said maybe should have been a
dev kit kind of situation they maybe
should have expressed the situation that
it was in before before pushing it in
the way that they did
I don't think saying dev kit would have
necessarily been the right way of going
about it but but broadcasting that like
you're on the bleeding edge could have
been cool and made up for any shortfalls
that it has oh lordy a cool dude on
YouTube has a suggestion for a video
that sounds like straight out of a mr.
beast title you should buy one and
don't count out loud while folding it as
many times as you can before it oh my
god
okay one that does 100% sound like a mr.
B's video - I'd probably click on that
video skip to the end and then leave
yeah he's probably working on it but
every time he folds it he like gives
some $100 or something all right let's
move on to our next topic cuz honestly I
don't think I have a what a lot else to
say a jump to this one I think this
one's more interesting yeah I think the
Sony sexy content regulation is honestly
kind of boring yeah um so this was
originally posted on the forum by
nevermind no one no one ever gional
articles from tech spot.com and
basically what's going on yeah I think
we need sexy content from social media
sites so it seems to have to do with so
I don't know in favor of this why don't
you go ahead and defend yourself so to
be clear I was joking you're a joke what
I mean I was joking
but I'm down to try it's gonna be
difficult I don't necessarily think oh
man so I have to try to fight for the
other side echo echo echo kill this
you're broadcasting your audio oops
sorry
oh I guess you stopped sharing salewa
parently did a thousand folds Oh
lightweight and it didn't break I think
when we did our mini fools when we did
our USB type-c I think we did five
thousand insertions didn't something
break by at that point - uh yes our
micro B did yeah yeah yeah so you win
until you had to stop and I actually
didn't do all of them I only did about
300 to 500 yeah that was back during
like his first couple weeks he gets this
assignment that's like unplug and replug
and actually it was five was it I think
it was five thousand yeah you can have
it Dennis I think it was five thousand
each on type-c and micro be Dallas
Dallas brutal poor James anyways so the
the UK's will
whoever's trying to push this in the UK
their stance seems to be that it there's
the psychological effect of wanting to
get more likes on social media or
something that I've never heard of
because I don't use snapchat but streak
streak points honestly I have a snapchat
I feel so bad because we actually
approach snapchat like worked with them
to take our handle back from someone who
already had it and then proceeded to
literally not post once ever well you
should have taken the handle though so
that makes sense but like yeah I felt a
little bad if you would yeah I don't
remember what the snapchat thing is
called but some thing on snapchat that
makes people want to use it more and
likes because of the influence that it
can have over so the idea is that in the
same way that achievements in video
games are designed to to like do you ban
those to like where does this stop okay
I mean when a Windows Windows Europe
stop trying to police the whole internet
okay he's getting really enough for one
thing brexit the UK is not Europe
they're not done yet well you know what
right now I let my sort of are sorry
anyway so I think I don't know in a
nutshell the argument is that much in
the same way that an achievement in a
game hits the same centers of your brain
that a drug hit will from an addiction
v8 like gambling gambling or drugs in
the same way that that those same
centers of your brain are activated by
achievements in games or or getting
positive feedback from from from likes
and there's definitely think oh yeah
they're saying that because of that it
should be regulated and restricted from
minors in the same way that other
addictive substances and activities are
the problem is I'm not usually one to
make the slippery slope argument yeah I
think over the years that we've hosted
this show together you've probably heard
me make that argument very few
I can't even think of I don't know if
ever I just don't want to necessarily
say never like because that's a hard
yeah I don't not often because really
not often IIF at all
I usually understand I usually can at
least understand why we are you know
taking this certain action as an
exception even if I don't agree
fundamentally with I think sometimes
it's the direction argument is valid can
be but I think most of the time by the
time we're reaching the slippery slope
argument we've actually gone too far
like you can't say okay the the the
Chinese social social social merit
whatever it's good yeah that that
Chinese social citizenship score thing
you can't be like oh well if they start
monitoring if you jaywalk then it's a
slippery slope before they're monitoring
you chewing gum then you're in Singapore
that's not a slippery slope like 24/7
surveillance of your of your citizens
it's just you're you're rolling off the
so the so it's shaped like this okay you
guys you got your ground rolling you got
your slope and then you got your kind of
jump there's a cliff okay we're here
you're like in midair
we're in FIFA like we haven't actually
no no we're like we're going off the
jump like we haven't descended yet it
feels like it feels like we're still
going up but there's nothing but open
air below the slope is in the rear feet
here like that so I'm I'm usually loathe
to make that argument but in this case
as a parent I do agree that there are
activities that do need to be regulated
when it comes to children they cannot
control themselves when it comes to
things like microtransactions for
example I think there should be
regulation there but like that
microtransaction feels like something
where there should be parental controls
or some type of thing to stop that from
happening whatever something built-in
like button feels like something where I
I need your input on this one yeah but
that feels like a parenting thing that
feels like partially a parenting thing
and also partially just I'm sorry that's
the way the world works now thing
because social media all it is is
amplifying the tendencies and the
behaviors that we already have in that
we already exhibit so if I were to do a
cool kickflip on my skateboard at the
skate park right if I were to do that
and you know the three guys that are
sitting on the bench over there like
that's alike that's cool that's good
it's exactly the same thing yeah so when
I post a video online of doing a cool
kickflip and 30 or 300 or 3,000 or
30,000 or 300,000 people click that like
button that's just like and there's
there's good influence there because if
you if you get 300,000 people liking
your video of a kickflip maybe you have
a career in skateboarding that have you
or that's that's how the modern internet
works like a so I guess what I'm just
kind of trying to figure out is at what
point do you cross the line from banning
addictive behaviors to banning basic
human interaction but just it happens to
be online and like this this is being
proposed and like what defines alike is
it literally only thumbs up and things
that say like or is it up votes
does that count that's sort of the same
thing do you Ben all of Reddit like like
that that's that would we be better off
without reddit baby but okay this this
I'm wondering with with the continuation
of like oh you can't share that
different type of content I know I
realize that's the mostly a money-making
type of thing and now the banning of the
like button and etc etc and with the
increased not necessarily tech literacy
but ability to use browsers and things
getting much more simple it over all
even the complicated stuff yep I
wonder ten 15 years from now yeah
dark web stuff being more mainstream
there's a lot of mainstream websites
that are making dark web mirrors of
their websites so it's kind of weird but
it's going on tell me more about this
trend I confess I have not heard let me

I'll make it work anytime there's maple
buffalo bacon I just completely wash out
and I go straight for the maple bacon I
love it
savage jerky is made with high quality
ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives their goal is to create a
snack that's full of flavor and spice
but that isn't bad for you I always
salivate as I open the bag he's like
that straight up Pavlov's Bell yeah yeah
holding the bag is like absolutely hell
my tongue here they would drip it would
actually drain yeah yeah they've got 13
different flavors of jerky like sriracha
bacon and my favorite the maple buffalo
bacon there's actually no food in my
life that causes that reaction as much
as these I don't necessarily know what
it is but they also make barbecue sauce
hot sauce a spice rub oh man I've been
having that that hot sauce I took home
like three or four drops it's the Reaper

drops in an entire bowl of pasta and

man okay I lied I'm actually not quite
done because I am so excited about this
it's finally here
and a little bit that went down the
wrong pipe so this is actually very good
timing the Linus tech tips watch should
you unbox fullscreen oh yeah totally
oh sorry yeah okay join me to unbox yeah
we can Vanna wait really build up open
them I guess here they go off the
printing on the box the packaging the
Linus tech tips water bottle Linus tech
tips water bottles are purpose-built to
keep hot drinks hot for up to eight
hours and cold
scold for up to 16 for optimal use and
lifespan of this product please pay
close attention to the following
warnings and instructions this product
is not dishwasher safe do not place in
the microwave do not place or store in
the freezer do not overfill to prevent
spills and leaking the lid needs to be
properly and fully tightened to ensure
an airtight seal this water bottle is
not intended for the long-term storage
of liquids like do not overfill like
don't waste stuff I guess it's so we
just got our first advanced shipment of
them so we shipped a few of them by air
people can see the printer warehouse
yeah I'll show them in more detail after
we got so we got our first advanced
shipment by air so there's actually only
a few units right now but there's
another I don't know how many well I
don't even want to say it's Lots because
I think we're gonna sell out of these
really fast but we have more coming by
boat probably in the next two to four
weeks so if you don't get one out of the
ones that are in the warehouse now there
are more coming but after that it's
probably gonna be a few months before we
could restock them so they're like a
matte black bottle they've got like a
glossy orange Linus tech tips up the
side and then that's not even the
coolest part the entire rest of the
bottle is actually printed with I
believe it's a socket 478 motherboard so
it's like kind of a retro like a retro
motherboard that we yeah that we took
like the schematic of and then put on in
like this kind of glossy black it looks
even sharper in person than it does on
camera but I'm just gonna switch over to
my screen here so I've got a few better
really notes so that's kind of a that's
actually a pretty that's a pretty view
of what it looks like that's pretty good
too oh yeah the top so the top is a
screw cap that is attached like of that
one nice thing about it is I know not
necessarily all people are into this but
I like the wide mouth because you can
get ice cubes into it and you can get
like
if you're not drinking just water it
says you can take hot drinks right yeah
makes it easy to do stuff like T's or
whatever else mm-hmm
so stoked I have been so excited about
these things and they are finally here
and that water is so cold that's
wonderful so yeah hopefully you guys are
as stoked on them as I am it's LTT
store.com and we actually have an offer
for you guys yeah orders over $50 are
gonna get five bucks off with offer code
LAN bottle when bottle all one word waa
n vo TT le all lowercase so that's live
from now until Monday five dollars off
any order of $50 or more so if you grab
your water bottle shirt a t-shirt maybe
throw some cable ties in guys you're
ready to rock yeah all right
can i water cooling LTT water bottle or
can Linus make a video of water cooling
LT t water bottle oh boy don't tempt me
so actually what could be doable we
could use it as like a reservoir there'd
be no reason to do it it would be stupid
but yeah we could we could probably do
that we can just flip it up create a
custom acrylic that could look really
cool actually kind of cool you wouldn't
be able to monitor your coolant levels
so it's not the kind of thing I would
actually recommend and it is not
designed for the long-term storage of
liquids theoretically yes so to jump
back to the topic I was talking about
previously yeah apparently Facebook has
launched a tour network site an onion
Network site really yeah
Hertz security reasons for their users
and like I yeah that's the motivation
it's pretty weird for someone to like
onion Network into their own Facebook
account but with stuff like that
happening and I believe there was other
ones but I couldn't find them all right
now it doesn't matter but like I have at
least one mainstreaming example of a
very large big website that tons of
people use that has made a
effectively mirror on a dark web service
I think it's gonna happen more I think
is gonna happen a lot more actually I
think it's gonna take quite a while like
a really long time but I think it's
gonna happen more because the main
Internet as we know it is gonna become
like the amount of bills that have been
coming out restricting what people can
do changing different access to things
doing all this kind of stuff
governments from all over the freaking
planet it's if it seems like trendy at
this point in time to try to control how
the internet works and that's just gonna
get even worse over time and I think
people are gonna try to run away from
that because the Internet is we know it
is it's constantly changing and in not
good ways like I don't know if you've
heard what's going on with man what is
their actual name I know the dude's name
South African tech YouTube channel did
Bitcoin stuff for a long time now
they're a little bit not doing as much
Bitcoin stuff I would hope not
why can't I remember their name that's
knowing anyway cell phones that detail
yes you have detect I a teal D Tech in
my mind I was like I know that's not
obviously yeah
but anyways South African yeah South
Africa's killing our YouTube channel
apparently they pass something or
they're trying to pass something I don't
know I don't know all the details I'm
sorry but where you have to like pass
all images or series of images also in
his videos through the government before
you post them online okay so like
because some dude didn't like memes
being made about him or something I
don't know but like if they're basically
shutting down all South African content
creators that sucks Wow I don't know if
this bill went through or not again I
don't know any of the details South
African law is not a strong suit of mine
but like government's getting their
hands in on Internet is a major thing
right now definitely a trend so I think
I think people are gonna try to scatter
and get away from it oh crap people are
asking how many fluid ounces it is I
believe it's 12
I don't quote me on that though I don't
remember wouldn't be surprised it's not
on dang it yeah it's not on here is it
on the website that's 12 fluid ounces in
cups
our Mills is fine one and a half cups no
I think it's more than that maybe it's
16 then yeah that's way more than one
and a half cups it's probably 16 no it
doesn't I think that's why people are
mad oh no no no no yeah okay sorry we'll
get back to you on that I don't think
it's 20 definitely seems more than 12
yeah I don't think it's 20 because you
guys got to remember this is a vacuum
water bottle so the walls are quite
thick yeah 16 I think would make sense
you know really don't know them all
right what else do we have do we have to
do news anymore or can we just like
shoot the breeze I think we could shoot
the breeze we did the odd spots
we're like the majority of vast majority
of the way through the show
facial-recognition to become standard
and US airports though that kind of
sucks we could talk about that yeah okay
Department of Homeland Security plans to
use facial recognition technology on 97%
of departing passengers within the next
four years it was first started rolling
out in 2017 was operational in 15
airports as at the end of 2018 and it
works by photographing passengers at
their departure gate then Crawford it
then cross-references this photograph
against a library populated with images
from visa and passport applications as
well as those taken by border agents
when foreigners enter the country it
will allow us Sephora teas to identify
people who have overstayed their visas
they've traditionally relied on airline
flight manifests to track who's leaving
the country but apparently since the
introduction of the system facial
recognition identified seven thousand
passengers who overstayed their visas on
the fifteen thousand flights tracked so
they estimate that over 600,000 people
overstay their visas every year an
offense that carries a maximum penalty
of a 10-year ban from entering the u.s.
alrighty then
okay so roast yeah
people thought we were mad at each other
you me mm-hmm
you didn't see those comments no on
floatplane I saw a significant number of
people so there there were discussion
see the discussion threads on Reddit
they're not not mostly about you and me
mostly thought that there was going to
be strain on my marriage because of some
of some of the the roast material
between me and Yvonne I knew there
wouldn't be beforehand but evidence that
wasn't on camera you guys were happy
laughing joking being very friendly
couple people at the dinner afterwards
they were more than fine honestly
that is no worse than stuff that we say
to each other on a regular basis and
always in like not not in anger or
anything like yeah like we just we mess
with each other a lot and we consider it
something honestly I will say that it
kind of blows my mind when people think
that the interaction my wife and I are
having could somehow be negative yeah
because I I'm glad that I can I can say
things in jest that are taken as a joke
I mean I've said a lot of times I think
that the world would be a better place
if people took the words for what they
meant as opposed to what they said
obviously when I make a joke about my
wife's flat chest I don't mean that I
don't like her and I don't mean that I
care and that it's a problem yeah I mean
that those last two are pretty important
objectively that's a thing that's true
lol and ignoring that isn't like yeah
it's like what should I say should I say
I've never seen such a busty woman in
all my years then you're kind of an
idiot or blind or a liar or a liar right
I don't want to be any of those things
it's it's gotta be one of them I can't
we just be honest with each other so
you're blind you would have probably you
know that's a policy that's worked
pretty well for me
no honesty in relationships is really
important and people who can't handle
honesty quite frankly my life is better
without them so yeah no no no what no
one's mad it's all good I thought it was
hilarious I had a blast I thought it was
so it was like all of my favorite part
about all of your jokes was that I
laughed before anyone else because I
knew where you were going
I found that so hilarious I watched that
whole part over again cliff I was so
funny the second you go you look at me
you're like he's a liar you know I just
[Laughter]
probably flinch I got the wording
correct yeah yeah yeah man it was really
funny though
I enjoyed the whole thing I didn't know
there was any comments about that to be
honest oh yeah no there were a ton of
comments like honestly it was a ton of
fun we've been working on the red carpet
interviews this week yeah so did you do
you did an interview write a little one
yeah yeah so they've been so the youtube
version is actually gonna have quite a
few things different from the floatplane
version a couple of the jokes are gonna
get cut not actually because they were
too offensive that's not the reasoning
it was more to do with flow okay so I
think there's two or three that I'm
gonna be fighting it out with James I
think he wants to leave all the jokes
intact I disagree I think some of the
the off-camera banter was b-minus
material at best and just disrupted the
flow and should just be cut so so well
he and I will fight it out yeah so a
couple of the jokes will be cut the
swearing will be censored yeah and then
one of the biggest changes you know
what's lucky you know how we didn't have
microphones pointed at the audience yeah
so the the feed that Dennis has in in
his edit is way better in terms of
audience reaction noise because it
didn't have the guy at the live mixing
board everyone who wasn't talking so
we've got nine mics open at the front of
the room okay and they actually pick up
quite a bit more of it so I was worried
we were gonna have to
laugh track it just to get back to where
we are yeah so I don't know if I think
we've mentioned it a few times but
people watching now if you watch the
roast they we didn't have mics dedicated
in the audience that's why like one of
the people doing a roast might pause for
a little while and like chuckle to
themselves slightly it's not necessarily
an awkward pause most likely the
audience was laughing yeah so so the
good news is we don't have to alter that
but what we're also going to change is
we're going to structure the whole thing
more like a TV broadcast so at the start
there's going to be like the red carpet
interviews there's these amazing title
cards well I saw mine did you see your
really cool should we try to get one
probably find mine yeah can you can you
get one and then we'll show it on stream
so there's these amazing title cards for
all the Roasters little snippets of
interviews and then what we're actually
going to do is we're gonna experiment
with something that we've I think only
once tried before it's really funny we
get comments on our videos every once in
a while like a way to squeak over the 10
minute mark by bloating the video no no
no that only matters if you run an extra
mid role on the video that's the only
reason you get paid more for it now I
can just switch to your screen yeah give
me a sec though I I will in a sec so so
there's no there's no benefit to being
over 10 minutes unless you actually run
more ads which we don't do because we
have our own sponsor stuffed baked in
hey where would I find the the cards for
the Roasters the title cards yeah yeah
is it in the folder somewhere like L
roller
nice graphics
I need Photoshop yeah oh really cuz
they're PS DS probably yeah oh you don't
have no all those are the original
pictures oh that's too bad
oh my god Oh excited for Kyle I think oh
yeah there's one okay good good good
okay so we've got at least a couple to
show you guys at least cool and we can
show you Kyle's picture for his it's
amazing yeah um so so we've got that so
then anyway what we're gonna do is write
really you guys Wow all right so we're
actually gonna split the video up into
like commercial breaks okay so we're
gonna like go to commercial actual spot
and then we're gonna have probably like
our own message like we'll have like a
spot for the madrenas coffee roast Bob
LA or like get the commemorative
LTTE roast shirt at LTT store calm and
then we're gonna run a YouTube mid-roll
so it's an hour and a half long so we'll
probably run like three or four of these
spots but yeah the whole thing is going
to be actually structured like a
broadcast cool I would just I don't know
it's like kind of a it's kind of a neat
idea yeah um so anyway here's here's
Luke's I love that's super cool I don't
remember
I don't remember what I was just
standing there the glass it must have
been grabbed
while we were like like waiting around
before the show I loved it and then I've
got a couple more over on my system here
so this is mine that's actually pretty
legit oh man this is Kyle's I'm just
excited it looks so legit oh I'm so
excited so yeah we have people started
spamming the floatplane logo in for a
chat okay so for those mongering
yes but like Director's Cut version is
gonna hit flow plane yeah the only
difference then will just be that it's
uncensored so it'll still have the
couple of awkward jokes or pauses cut
like it'll be the exact same cut as
YouTube except it's just going to not be
censored so are you guys doing the add
spots which ones in the oh in the flow
plane one you know what probably not I
would think maybe the madrenas I would
think we might leave the madrenas ones
because they did sponsor the show and
we'll probably leave the shirt yeah
those are so topical and they'll
probably I don't know so that's the
purpose of the ones that we're baking in
is that they are directly tied to the
roast yeah actually you know what
that makes sense can I show them the the
mock-up of the roast shirt graphic okay
cool yeah yes it's pretty great that's
what I'd really like that
um where is my chat with him though I
don't talk to no no I've got it I've got
it I've got it it's just a matter of
scrolling up through it here we go I'm
so excited for the shirt design are we
still doing the wondering color yes okay
so here it is whoa that's pretty cool oh
is this completely something else have
you seen the pin oh the pins really cool
I love that I am so I just wanted one
with like an ltte logo here and then a
huge image of that pin on the back yeah
I love that pin it's super cool yeah
that makes sense that makes sense yeah
but yeah so this is like the that's
super cool I know absolute yeah that's
like that works for a whole bunch of
reasons
that's a meme in itself that's pretty
but one change we ended up making is
this bag of the ltte roast is also going
to be the lighter color okay so that it
stands out from the table and everything
yeah but yeah this is fine everything is
fine
that's pretty awesome apparently I have
tinder open yeah super tinder I think
you're thinking of Google Docs kit guru
Twitter float
plain Gmail Google photos YouTube and
the line is tech tips store nothing I'm
gonna get in trouble for for sure
wow what can I help you with by the way
twin derp water bottle questions yeah
Nick's here oh yeah
sup we have quantities oh no it seems
like it's 20 ounces 20 ounces but we're
gonna confirm that marina at it we will
confirm that and add it also if you want
one you can just stand closer so I don't
have to repeat also if you want one over
20 percent of the stock is gone already
look for like what's currently in our
warehouse oh really
yeah oh so if you want one you should
order one and then we're probably gonna
set up a backorder for the remaining
ones that we have on order and then we
have to order more so I told you we were
gonna have to order more I know I told
them I was like these are gonna be fire
I love this thing so much we have gotten
burned on some stuff I've already seen
people complaining like it's 30 dollars
that's a lot yes these types of water
boils are pretty spins we know these
types of water bottles also are not that
cheap my glue dude and the thing is legs
we want one that is a trash the merch
business overall has to at some point
stop losing money for us just laughs we
do have to make some margin on it that's
that's all I can really say like that's
the thing is in any business the the
successful products pay for the ones
that weren't as successful and so that's
what this has to do with that set I
don't think I don't think $29.99 us is
entirely unreasonable it's also fully
custom and really nice yeah so that's
the other thing too guys is we're not
just putting our label on like a water
bottle that we found on Aliexpress or
whatever like this everything about this
was designed for us it's full custom so
if you just go to like the local print
shop or like CafePress or whatever and
just you know customize print your logo
on it it's not gonna be the same quality
like the thing on here is really durable
like it's actually really nice so I
don't know I don't think it's
unreasonable we do have to make some
margin and we are doing the five dollar
coupon code as a launch promos that's
already someone in Phillip Lane chat
he's like I got a t-shirt in the water
bone he's the code Ray and just to be
clear when you say we're not just like
yes we are working with people overseas
so like but we're creating a custom
product here anything like that but
we're doing a lot of work on the front
end to make it fully custom to us and
the thing is that there's a lot of
overhead involved in that we've
literally been working on this water
bottle for like three months now someone
someone in chat brought up shipping to
Australia I can add in that I know
shipping has been a something they've
been working on for a long time and I
know shipping scam Europe got a lot
better very recently yes Australia
should be less than $20 to get there it
just might take like up to three weeks
to get to you well that's kind of a
bummer but yeah working on it
also if right now Canada Post has an
issue where they're printing up tracking
numbers which are really reference
numbers so if you get a tracking number
that doesn't work don't worry your order
is still fine just Canada posted so
there's been there's been a lot of work
that's gone into like setting this up
and making it better but I've said this
before I'll say it again the the
commitment though is that our merch it
might not be cheap it might not be fast
it might not be easy but it'll be good
so that's the commitment and if it takes
us months to bring a water bottle to
market and we have to take on an
enormous order minimum order quantity in
order to get like the quality and the
customization that we want then we're
just gonna do it and hopefully it goes
well I mean already this one's a smash
hit somebody in chat said to be fair I
just shipped an eBay sale to Australia
and it was sixty three Canadian dollars
for less than two kilograms Canada Post
sucks so
they're dealing with really difficult
shipping problems when you go over
massive oceans it's a little expensive
but they're working on it just Canada
Pro post like wrecking you if you're not
doing enormous volumes with them yeah
but they're working on it it's so
frustrating because like right Royal
Mail in the UK like you can send a
letter overseas for like next to nothing
and so I think a lot of the time people
from places where shipping is heavily
subsidised like Hong Kong or the UK or
just like no it should be like sheep
cheap to ship packages like I I've
bought used books on eBay for like 350
that ship from the UK and I'm sitting
here going like what the Berenstain
Bears crossed an ocean to get here I
can't do that no amount of volume that I
could ship via Canada Post would get me
any way to get something to you for
three dollars and fifty cents re I do my
best
yeah we're excited I'm actually super
stoked on this to actually this is
finally the finished design for reserve
ETA for this no okay sorry actually it's
not quite finished I think we are gonna
make these ribbons more like this
thickness okay yes orange accents up
here are gonna be a little bit thinner
this is a really really cool hoodie
though so these are reflective so if
you're that's pretty good jarred their
high vis so there's one on the back as
well they don't look there's some stuff
that's reflective that looks annoying in
the daytime no this doesn't look
annoying I didn't even know it was no
it's like pretty stealthy that's wrong
it has the foam pocket that I actually
demoed on like social media before
that's big enough to fit even a note I'm
not trying to I'm not trying to like
oversell this stuff I just don't know
cuz I'm not a party team so I'm learning
this stuff live and it's cool so I can't
come out because of the way the pockets
are designed does it have like an over
lip or something it's just that the
pocket oh yeah so you have to like
really pull it out which okay yeah maybe
that's knowing but all
so just don't put it in there unless you
really don't want it to fall out like
it's either you can fall out or you can
put it in the bigger mode or you can put
it over here yeah so no I really like
this one of the latest problem we had
with it so the reason this one's delayed
this one we've been working on for like
four or five months was the supplier
that we were gonna go with for whatever
reason couldn't do a YKK zipper we're
like well that's stupid we're not gonna
ship like this is not going to be that
cheap we're not gonna ship a hoodie at
this price point that doesn't have
something that people recognize to be a
high-quality zipper yeah like well this
one's fine no it's not fine
so we have solved that problem okay
there you go anyway yeah I think that's
it for the show though yeah I think
that's I think that's pretty much when
can we get the jacket I'm sorry I don't
know I really don't know we're the hats
and the other jacket you know the really
cool on the stuffing right yes I love
that one and that one's gonna be really
affordable too I don't think that one
has a YKK zipper but it's gonna be at a
lower price point it looks really cool
I don't know when any of its coming and
I wish all this stuff was faster
underwear yeah where's my boxers aren't
the boxers aren't here but I actually
finally have you know what I'm just
gonna go get my backpack stall them okay
there aren't any news topics yet so what
I will talk about is there's been yeah
the kind of yeah so there's been a lot
of stuttering as people have noticed on
flow plane but if you watch on twitch
and YouTube there's been a lot of
stuttering there as well and throughout
the entire show I'm just gonna address
this because a lot of people in the live
chat have been commenting on it and I
believe some of its gonna go into the
vaad so I think I'm talking about people
to here I've been looking over and I've
seen a lot of stuttering in OBS right
there I don't think that's the only
problem necessarily but there's
something wrong with this computer we've
been saying that for freaking months I
think I have finally convinced Jake that
it's Windows so he's gonna finally
actually reformat the damn thing I don't
work for him anymore so it's not really
my deal but yeah I think they're
actually going to do it
looking at OBS there are zero dropped
frames and the CPU doesn't seem to be
over overly utilized an old Linus has
been saying he thinks the CPU thing but
it's it's very low utilization the whole
time so I believe it's a windows problem
so we're gonna do a reformat hopefully
before next week I'll try to get on
Jake's but about doing that and
hopefully that will resolve a problem
yeah Jake thrown under the bus it yeah
yeah I told you like a long time ago
you should reform out of windows in Jake
and Jake's defense though he also had
like videos to make that I needed him to
do okay um sort of throwing him under
the bus though it's not like he got them
done so who also reporting Windows is of
mostly like actually he got tied up
mostly by side projects this makes like
next progress this so this I'm probably
not supposed to show this to and Nick's
gonna freak out because he hates it when
I like tease stuff that's just never
gonna be available but will it will it's
just going to take a while this looks
super legit is the finished not the
print see how there's like this weird
black like gap key on the back and stuff
yeah and also the I think the angle of
the printing is not quite right the the
pouch at the front is going to also be
printed there's like a weird kind of
like misalignment sort of or like the
angle changes see how it's like kind of
flat on this side and it's angled on
this side so we could have fixed that
but we wouldn't have been able to do the
single piece seamless back so that was
like what matters more yeah
and we decided comfort comfort comfort
first but we have gone back and forth
with I think at this point over half a
dozen suppliers multiple times in order
to finally settle on the material so
there's different not you don't get to
touch it yet but I haven't worn these so
they're clean they're right so just wear
them to work and then taking them off
midday so they're at work yeah assumed
very clean so there's there's different
they're like there's different materials
that could be considered premium so one
of them is in the dow and lloyd I was
pushing really hard for Maddow he wanted
Maddow and we're and I was like look I
don't like it so I've never it's a super
sight it feels like high thread-count
sort of beddings like it's really soft
like kind of silky but probably too
slick but it's not that supportive like
it doesn't have a lot of like hold yeah
yeah I was gonna say that sounds not
like sporty enough so what we settled on
was I'm at Alcott and blend that we
actually had to have the factory custom
produce an entire like not a bolt of
cloth like like a like an industrial
yeah like I don't know what the unit is
it's not a ream it's not a bolt it's
like we actually had to have them custom
make this material for us and then
they'd sent us the sample one of these
sample garments so they're just like
storing this gigantic roll of material
and then we're gonna do the production
run hopefully pretty soon but I'd feel
it wow that's actually really nice so
it's a cotton module blend that we had
to have them custom do for us so it's
still really soft yeah like really soft
on your hands but nice and stretchy and
springy and stuff yeah so I'm like super
stoked on these that's what so excited
so there's gonna be three different
colors there's this one I don't actually
know it's hard to give it to get across
like yeah this feels good ah here's one
of the other colors I like that one so
they'll come in a 3-pack okay so you'll
get this one then there's like this one
and then there's a blue background I
think you don't have an orange one no
interesting so we are kind of it's not
that we're moving away from orange it's
that we are broadening our palette a
little bit we don't want to be locked
into orange forever because what we've
discovered is that especially when it
comes to our demands
apparel yeah it's hard to make it look
like when you're doing um when
doing a piece like this would be bold
people constantly used to ask me what
orange is Ltd orange the forum uses
multiple different oranges because it
will look drastically different
depending on what colors are around it
so at some point in time we just decided
we'll just change it so that it sort of
looks the same all the time even though
it's not because if we actually make it
technically the same orange it looks
wildly different across the whole site
so it's it's kind of a frustrating color
to work with and I'm not even a designer
so we have sold 30% of the water-bottle
inventory that's in the warehouse so 10%
more since yeah people are like how much
are the Box stars gonna cost
I don't know the reason that we're doing
bundles of 3 though is because I don't
think these are gonna be as high margin
of an item they were really expensive
for us anyway yeah that's pretty
standard but the the reason was that we
needed to make sure that we weren't just
shipping out one unit at a time because
our handling costs which are actually
you know you know who does our handling
for us do you remember Patrick yeah yeah
so it's actually one of the old
warehouse managers at NCIX who's like
super good guy he's fantastic so he
started his own business but they're
really small so I mean part of it is
like we really want to work with Patrick
because he knows his shiz and he's
honest he's reliable like we can count
on him we trust him but like he's a
super he's a startup he's a start-up so
like he's doing his best but what it
means is that our handling costs are a
little bit on the higher side not
because he's gouging us or anything but
because he's he's starting up he's
building his momentum right now so our
handling cost per item are pretty high
so if we bundle them together yes you
pay more but you get three of them and
then we can amortize that overhead over
three units of it and we can still make
decent margin that's all you're
certainly gonna it's almost like I'm
doing my old job again
[Laughter]
mmm it's great you're probably gonna end
up paying less per unit like per per
boxer absolutely yeah absolutely so
palatable whenever you go to the store
buying a single pair of socks or buying
a single unit of underwear is almost
never worth it compared to buying a
multipack people are like we need LTT
thongs says the grassy bush LTX LTX
stuff is there an update lame' family
plain merch
hey there's actually a shirt yeah there
is a shirt come it'll be available
exclusively at LTX very limited
quantities yeah so you better be there
and I'm I'm like I don't even know we're
not even a hundred percent certain at
this time if we're gonna be selling them
oh really
okay the amount of creators are gonna be
at LTX are gonna be on the platform that
are probably gonna want to have some
shirts got it and are probably gonna
want to give some shirts away oh we
actually have a really important LTX
update BYOC update and last call for
early bird pricing so if you haven't
bought your LTX Dreamhack ticket yet do

ish yes so guys noon tomorrow
BYOC
that's the only we are not going to be
able to create more boa FC tickets this
is not like a concert where they're like
sold out performance that's like well
why do you have a radio ad running for
it because we're gonna open up mercy
yeah this is not that you guys actually
need to get your tickets this time and
we actually were sold out yeah so oh wow
there's a whole bunch more stuff update
from Dreamhack on some of the view
biopsy activities so cool we understand
that some attendees prefer a very
competitive environment while others
enjoy more relaxed atmosphere so we've
decided to provide both they'll be
hosting between three to six competitive
tournaments attendees will need to come
prepared with pre organized teams ready
to compete for trophies and press wow
they're like doing tournaments and stuff
yeah that's super cool they were just
doing I want to cast the rocket League
tournament I've said it before I'm
serious about that though I want to do
that the format rule set and schedule
for each tournament will be posted in
advance you'll have plenty of time to
prepare your team the first two games
were announcing for this format are
Rainbow six siege and rocket League the
other games will be decided by popular
vote via a survey that'll be sent to the
BYOC attendees after the BYOC sells out
again so probably sometime on Sunday for
anyone not interested in competitive
tournaments they'll be hosting plenty of
casual pop-up events throughout the
weekend some previous favorites include
one our build offs in Minecraft and
Terraria private server free-for-alls in
pub G and fortnight and 32 view 32
brawls in quake and UT just to name a
few that's so sick there oh that's
really there under a hundred days left
to the event buy your tickets now at
they put their track link there but it
doesn't really matter the hje /lt x19
we'll see you there so guys it's gonna
be awesome
I'm so stoked I might just get
Backstreet Boys and just say I don't
know I can what I might do and this is
like I realize I'm sounding like kind of
a crazy out-of-touch rich person right
now but what I might do I really want to
see them is I might just grab a plane
ticket so I'll scalp my tickets grab a
plane ticket and fly in soon or else
okay I thought you're gonna like the
side of their house well you can charter
a float plane to the Vancouver
Convention Center oh really
that would be so cool that offers a
floatplane marketing expense I thought
because where is the concert it's
downtown Vancouver actually wouldn't
need a plane oh well no I was thinking
like if it was Zach if it was against
water you could fly from healthy extra
Backstreet Boys I might just do it
though cuz I honestly I think LTX 2019
is gonna be like once-in-a-lifetime III
mean LTX 2020 yeah we're gonna do
everything in our power to to crush 2019
but 29 - it's the first of us doing it
this big yes and like I don't know that
certain things we're doing this year
would be possible it is costing us
almost 50,000 US dollars to fly out the
incredible roster of tech creators that
are going to be recruit to be on full
plane so this is what we have confirmed
so far yes my friends know it's not just
Linus tech Expo it's like I'll be there
sure but I don't know by the time by the
time we're done I may not be the most
famous person there and that would be
great because we're not necessarily done
I think we've spent just over 40 grand
so far on plane tickets accommodations
Plus Ones camera people like making sure
that these guys are comfortable these
are all like very important people very
busy you know we're not paying any of
them to be there but we need to make
sure that we're accommodating them and
making sure that they're comfortable and
yeah it's exciting but it's also so I
don't know I don't know what future LT
X's will look like but this year has
been a breakout year and I'm really
excited so yeah like - stop shaking your
feet is Linus in the closet I mean
Backstreet Boys really you can like
music without having a particular sexual
orientation just saying and that's far
far from the uncoolest music that I
enjoy
there you go oh we should totally just
change it legendary tech Expo how they
deleted their message that's weird
I I liked the idea you should have it be
one of those like cheesy things where
you have like you have tech Expo or what
it's T stand for it it technics - tech
Expo so just force the L to stay there
have tech Expo stay there and then just
swap the word that comes in after the L
old habits die hard
but you could swap in like legendary
leet whatever
hmm that could be like a transition yeah
like a transitionary yeah yeah so you
can make it like the L kind of stands
for what you want yeah just slowly
detach all right yeah I love Nickelback
sorry one step forward and two steps
back I think we're done for the day see
you guys next time
same same bat-time same bat-channel am I
even here next week I think holy crap
you were spamming the hell out of invite
Lewis Rosman um yeah yeah I'd bring this
sure why not he was there last time yeah
yeah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
