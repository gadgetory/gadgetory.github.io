brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital so we're here with DJI a
brand I actually hadn't heard of before
but they are drawing a lot of attention
here at the show flying around their
phantom 2 vision quadrocopter this is a
high-performance quadrocopter and of
course the obvious comparison is going
to be drawn to the AR Drone but it's a
little bit different from the AR Drone
so rather than using sonar to detect its
height it actually has a different
sensor system to detect not only its
height but also its distance away from
you which is allowing it to stay stable
even in this crowded hall
it also supports Wi-Fi controls k so
that's similar as well as first-person
view as well as taking video and photos
rights of the quality has been stepped
up to correspond to the increased price
so it's around $1,200 but it can go as
far as 300 meters away from the
controller with the Wi-Fi extender that
you see here on the controller you
control it in a more traditional
hobbyist style so you move it down and
back and forth up and down and I think
they're about to take it away so what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to cover a
couple of things on here so there's a
motor controlled camera a battery
indicator and LEDs on the bottom of the
unit that allow us to orient it go ahead
and take that away thank you very much
the iPhone on the top of it can be used
to see it in first-person view and it
can also be used to control things like
camera settings like exposure for
example to make sure that you get the
best footage that you possibly can
this guy's got a GoPro hero3 mounted on
it so it's a little bit on the different
side I'm just gonna go ahead and give
you guys a bit of a better look at it
here it makes actually all things
considered not a ton of noise but I
wouldn't expect to be recording any
audio with the camera that's on this
thing so the main objective here because
it's so expensive it's not necessarily
for the casual consumer but for RC
enthusiasts just over a thousand dollars
might not seem that unreasonable for a
remote-control vehicle especially one
that includes a 1080p 14 megapixel
camera but then again guys there are all
kinds of different customers in this
world some pros might want to use this
but other pros might want to
up to the eighth rotor s1000 this one
they're not flying around in here but
due to its eight rotor design and carbon
fiber lightweight construction this guy
can hold a Canon 5d including look at
this there's a gimbal on it as well for
stabilized aerial footage and what's the
maximum range on this guy do you happen
to know off the top of your head it's
still actually under testing so we'll
release that once we release the product
well there you go guys either way the
booth is are drawing a ton of attention
here don't miss any of our CES 2014
coverage guys our trip to the show is
powered by NCIX
your choice for great technology
selection and service as well as corsair
and western digital</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
