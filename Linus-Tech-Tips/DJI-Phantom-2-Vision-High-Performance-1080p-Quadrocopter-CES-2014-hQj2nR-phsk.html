brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital so we're here with DJ I
a brand I actually hadn't heard of
before but they are drawing a lot of
attention here at the show flying around
their phantom 2 vision quadricopter this
is a high-performance quadricopter and
of course the obvious comparison is
going to be drawn to the ar.drone but
it's a little bit different from the
ar.drone so rather than using sonar to
detect its height it actually has a
different sensor system to detect not
only its height but also its distance
away from you which is allowing it to
stay stable even in this crowded Hall it
also supports Wi-Fi controls k so that's
similar as well as first person view as
well as taking video and photos right of
the quality has been stepped up to
correspond to the increased price so
it's around twelve hundred dollars but
it can go as far as 300 meters away from
the controller with the Wi-Fi extender
that you see here on the controller you
control it in a more traditional
hobbyist style so you move it kind of
back and forth up and down and I think
they're about to take it away so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to cover a
couple of things on here so there's a
motor controlled camera a battery
indicator and LEDs on the bottom of the
unit that allow us to orient it go ahead
and take that away thank you very much
the iphone on the top of it can be used
to see it in first person view and it
can also be used to control things like
camera settings like exposure for
example to make sure that you get the
best footage that you possibly can this
guy's got a GoPro hero3 mounted on it so
it's a little bit on the different side
I'm just going to go ahead and give you
guys a bit of a better look at it here
it makes actually all things considered
not a ton of noise but I wouldn't expect
to be recording any audio with the
camera that's on this thing so the main
objective here because it's so expensive
it's not necessarily for the casual
consumer but for RC enthusiasts just
over a thousand dollars might not seem
that unreasonable for a remote control
vehicle especially one that includes a
1080p 14 megapixel camera but then again
guys there are all kinds of different
customers in this world some pros might
want to use this but other pros might
want
step up to the eight rotor s1000 this
one they're not flying around in here
but due to its eight rotor design and
carbon fiber lightweight construction
this guy can hold a canon 5d including
look at this there's a gimbal on it as
well for stabilized aerial footage and
what's the maximum range on this guy do
you happen to know off the top of your
head it's still actually under testing
so we'll release that once we release
the product well there you go guys
either way the booth is are drawing a
ton of attention here don't miss any of
our CES 2014 coverage guys our trip to
the show is powered by NCIX your choice
for great technology selection and
service as well as corsair and western
digital</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
