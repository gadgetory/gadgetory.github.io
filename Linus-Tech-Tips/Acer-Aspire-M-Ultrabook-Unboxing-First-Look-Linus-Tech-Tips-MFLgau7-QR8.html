the aspire M from Acer this is part of a
refresh of ultrabooks that are coming in
at lower price points than the original
slew of Windows 8 touchscreen devices
that came out when Windows 8 launched so
that means you're gonna see a couple of
compromises that you didn't see on some
of the launch products but again it's
well a benefit is that it comes in at a
lower price point making a Windows 8
touchscreen notebook more affordable to
the general consumer so inside the box
we find a few different things so number
one is we get a summary of all the
things that are great about the m5 our
particular configuration has four gigs
of ram a 500 gig hard drive with a 20
gig SSD cache so there you go we've got
that in a number of different languages
there we've also got a power brick as
with well pretty much all ultra books
although this one is particularly slim
as with all ultra books the power brick
is quite slim so we'll do my trademark
cell phone comparison so you guys can
see the overall thickness of the
included power brick this is actually a
very important thing for notebooks for
me anyway because the notebook itself
can be as portable and slim as it wants
but at the end of the day if it's not if
the accessories that you have to carry
around with that are bulky and heavy
then you're not really getting any
benefit out of that lightweight slim
device that you've just purchased so
comes with a power brick next up inside
we've got not a whole lot there and
discs permanent storage oh look at that
that's cool
so it comes with an end disk if you guys
aren't familiar with em discs it's well
it says what it is it's permanent
storage so it's a recordable media that
lasts for over a thousand years or up to
a thousand years or whatever long long
that by the time you burn media to it
and you'll be long dead by the time it
actually degrades in any meaningful way
so that means that the drive included
with the aspire M is also M discs
compatible meaning it's manufactured by
LG so speaking of the optical disc I'd
like to show you guys yes this is an
ultrabook
with an optical drive
so if you do need a DVD rewriter in your
portable notebook say for example you
watch movies on DVD or whatever else you
carried around with you this guy's good
for about 5 hours of battery life with a
disk spinning in the drive or about 8
hours of general usage according to a
sir
so that means you can actually take it
with you on a flight and watch a couple
movies on DVD if you want to do that all
of this while maintaining that Ultrabook
level of slimness in order to get that
branding from Intel also included inside
is your travelers warranty so this right
here actually has a couple things so
it's got some quick sort of start guides
how do I access the charms menu how do I
get to start for example it also has
their international travelers warranty
so it's a one-year international
warranty I personally think every
notebook should have an international
warranty but not all of them necessarily
do so if you take your notebook and
travel to another territory another
country your warranty claim may actually
get rejected by the regional office
because they're not the ones who sold
you the notebook so Acer make sure that
that gets taken care of we've actually
booted up the notebook already and we
are you know basically going to show you
that yes it is indeed touchscreen it's
actually a 10-point multi-touch so we're
gonna just oh yeah Start menu doesn't do
that anymore so I always I always forget
these things now so we'll go here and
search for paint which is my favorite
application to show off a 10-point
multi-touch screen so just go ahead and
what I do
Acer photo ok apparently comes with a
photo management app let's go back here
and go like that ooh very responsive
actually nice you see how there's
absolutely no delay following around my
finger that makes a very very very big
difference to the touchscreen experience
so that's not necessarily true of every
touchscreen that you encounter so let's
have a look at the device physically the
hinge opens up almost 180 degrees looks
like about a hundred and seventy degrees
so I mean this is just one of those
usage scenarios that not everyone will
encounter but I used to walk around on
campus and university and just hold my
notebook like this and type things and
browse the web and read things so I mean
I know people have tablets now so that's
like not something would
people might do that much anymore but I
do like it when notebooks open up nice
and wide like this I had at one notebook
I found out that some of them are
artificially limited I have a notebook
where it opened up about this about this
far and then my baby came along and
pushed on it from the back put his full
weight on it and it kind of went crack
and then it opened up 180 degrees and it
didn't break in any other sort of
meaningful way so I'm not recommending
that you try that with your notebook but
I do appreciate that Acer provides this
one stock with with a yeah with with a
hinge that opens up wide like that so
the keyboard itself has a nice brushed
aluminum finish over the entire top
piece here so this looks like one solid
piece of aluminum nice large touchpad it
drives me crazy when manufacturers
include small touch pads with their
notebooks it is a multi-touch touchpad
so you can zoom in you can zoom out you
can do gestures and Windows 8 using it
keyboard itself has a little bit of flex
to it not not actually not bad so you're
gonna be able to type fairly solidly on
it they also haven't committed any
cardinal sins on the keyboard layout
itself so you've got long shift keys a
long Enter key and a very long backspace
this I mean this is something that I
can't emphasize enough a notebook can be
as solidly built and as beautiful as it
wants but if it has a keyboard that's
not usable then things basically not
usable in terms of i/o we've got a
webcam on the front here on the left
side we've just got that optical drive
so they probably had to clear a lot of
room internally this is a 14 inch
chassis so it's got a 1366 by 768 screen
if I didn't mention that already so it's
a 14 inch chassis which means that about
this much of the internals is taken up
by that notebook alone meaning that they
had to sort of rika Jigar things a
little bit so on the front you find just
a power button an indicator LED and then
a battery notifier you've also got an SD
card reader on the right with a
headphone microphone combo jack on the
right as well wouldn't mind seeing those
as discreet Jack's because not everyone
necessarily has a headset that uses a
single jack on the back you find exhaust
power in two USB 3.0 ports as well as
HDMI out Gigabit Ethernet and the
Kensington lock one of those is a
charging capable USB 3 port which just
means it outputs more current so you can
charge your tablet or whatever else you
would want fairly quickly the back of
the device has again a kind of a very
professional-looking brushed aluminum
finish to it with a simple Acer logo so
while this notebook may not sort of look
and that different from what anyone else
is using it won't stand out as being an
eyesore anything like that is so it's
compared to 799 machines that we've seen
in the past it's a huge step up in terms
of not only the look but also just the
overall build quality there's not a
whole lot of flex to the chassis itself
and you can see that the way they've
designed the hinge is very robust here
as well so they've actually got rather
than having the screen go all the way
down to the hinge point they've
separated a little bit here to make it
in my estimation what they're probably
trying to do here is make it more
resistant to accidental drops if it were
to land on a corner it's going to be
less likely to damage the actual screen
area so there's a bit of a plastic
buffer around here that that should
actually help with that
so on the bottom you don't find a whole
lot you've just got screws so you can
remove the entire bottom plate if you
need to get at anything inside and then
you've got a couple of ventilation holes
here as well as two stereo speakers and
rubber points here for making sure that
it doesn't slip around while you are
using it so we're gonna wrap up with a
couple straightforward points do all
your usual sort of hotkeys exist on the
function keys themselves so you can
adjust your brightness you can adjust
your volume Wireless all of that good
stuff you can also access most of these
things through the charms menu these
days though so you can see brightness is
just like that egg here this is
something that should have come around
on notebooks a long time ago but I'm
happy that it finally has and that is
backlit keyboard so the backlit keyboard
on this notebook actually adjusts itself
for the ambient light that's around you
and it uses an electroluminescent
backlight so that is just it's slightly
different from an LED backlight it's
very bright and shines not only around
the outside of the keys but also through
the letters themselves making it very
very easy to see what you're doing in
the dark whether you're working you know
on a plane where they've turned the
lights off or whatever else the case
maybe spec wise it has a core i5 I don't
believe I actually mentioned that before
and I think I made some notes for myself
on the yep so the only other thing is
just clarifying what it means to have a
500 gig hard drive with a 20 gig SSD
cache some people like I guess the
purists will say that that's not good
enough but remember guys Intel's
Ultrabook spec requires fast wake ups so
I'm gonna close the lid so I'm gonna put
it in sleep and you're gonna see that
what an SSD cache does is it gives you a
lot of the responsiveness of an SSD
without the additional cost and it
allows you to have the capacity of a
hard drive so it still wakes up nearly
instantly even though it doesn't have a
full SSD thanks for checking out this
