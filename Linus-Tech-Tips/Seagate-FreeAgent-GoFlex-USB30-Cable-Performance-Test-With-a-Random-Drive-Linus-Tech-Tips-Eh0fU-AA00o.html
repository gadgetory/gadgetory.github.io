freeagent go flex ultraportable drive
unboxing and first look I actually had
someone asked me a very interesting
question and while I don't always reply
to comments and messages I do make a
point of trying to read them they said
okay well you've got just two SATA
interface at the back of this external
hard drive so what would prevent you
from using these modular Seagate cables
which are very nice and very convenient
with just any old drive so I said well
gee I don't know why not
now while they may not work with desktop
drives due to the power requirements and
this may sound very very strange but I
actually had an SSD lying around but not
a single desktop drive at home here so
I've already tried this but I'm just
gonna demonstrate for the sake of for
the sake of demonstration so you go
ahead and just plug it into the back of
any old two and a half inch drive fits
right in there real nice light goes on
and then the computer detects local disk
D and if I can find my mouse and I'd be
able to show you this oh I went and hit
that stupid button hold on yeah there we
go
back to auto excellent okay so here you
can access local disk II and we can do a
quick you know what why don't we do a
quick speed test okay so big files you
know what let's yeah let's do the big
files test so I'm gonna drag this over
to my desktop and I'll let you guys time
it because you know YouTube oh man this
is gonna take a while okay well you can
see our transfer speed is around thirty
Meg's per second which is pretty typical
for USB 2.0 and I hope I'm able to find
something to talk about here uhm I could
show you the cats okay here what okay
well while this is running I'm just
gonna hold on did it go uh go to the
bathroom where I keep all of these cat
toys no about a second I'm gonna get
into a favorite toy here which all see
here they come running they know they
know what I have hey guys you like this
one don't you oh he's got it already got
their feather
which is very exciting for them they
like to fight it and let's see if the
final transfer is done it is not so okay
I'm going to let you guys see the state
of disrepair that my floor is in right
now I've been doing unboxings and the
thing about unboxing is you end up with
a lot of boxes and I don't really know
what to do with them all all the time oh
man probably fast today hey guys oh it
fell apart Oh their toy broke this is a
disaster hey now he's eating it hey get
off that get get off that no give me
that give me got me hey don't call that
neat
give me that rotten things okay here we
go file transfer is done okay so it took
approximately that long so what I also
discovered is that oh don't come up on
my deck in front of you these guys are
just ridiculous okay put that in my
pocket I rotten cat okay come with me
come here there we go cat okay so now
why don't we take that drive and go plug
it into the USB three version which I
have plugged into a test PC alright so
unplug that and I hit that stupid button
again that makes it so real okay so the
USB 3.0 version is plugged into a test
PC here which supports USB 3.0 my
computer actually does not support USB
3.0 it is a little bit older than that
so we'll go ahead and plug this in there
we go it will be hopefully perfectly
well supported there we go it's detected
already we open it up and then why don't
we do a quick speed test here and I'm
hopefully going to be actually there for
the the conclusion of this time but I
think the general point should be that
it goes much faster this is
SB 3.0 so we are seeing much much higher
transfer speeds Oh as high as I mouse
cursor megabytes per second note we're
seeing up to about 110 to 120 megabytes
per second so the total transfer is
going to take probably about 10-15
seconds so much faster than USB 2.0 if
you're actually trying to move around
substantial amounts of data in fact this
may even be bottlenecked by the vertex 1
120 gig hard drive that I'm using in the
test PC so that is done just now when I
took the camera away again so thank you
for checking out this sort of follow up
to the free agent what is it called free
agent go flex and so it looks like all
those cables can actually be used with
other two and a half inch drives just as
easily as they can be used with the free
agent go flex itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
