L II and I have to confess this is
actually the second time I've attempted
to unbox it I have my memory card full
so I have to restart here so anyway this
is EVGA s lowest end p55 board so far
it's an le or light Edition board you
can see that on the front we've got
logos for the core i7 and the core i5
but conspicuously missing are logos for
SLI or crossfire so we do not have
support for those on this board you can
see on the back they call out EVGA is
90-day step up program their elite
overclocking utility and let's get this
word out of the box because that's what
we all are here to see so it comes in a
black glossy box like all of their other
p55 boards so here we go we didn't
actually get very far last time so I'm
gonna be adventuring along with you here
so we've got a molex to 2 SATA power
adapter and then we've actually got 2
SATA cables only that's the fewest I've
seen in the accessory package for any
p55 board so far here we've got firewire
and two USB PCI bracket that's pretty
useful and then here this I really like
actually this has been included in all
of the EVGA p55 boards that we've
unboxed so far so here you've got an
over a visual guide sorry your
motherboard so shows you all of the
important features and it gives you a
quick installation guide for how to get
your system set up I really like the way
that they illustrate it here although
it's a little bit clumsy to use here
we've got the installation for drivers
and utilities and we have a black
divider inside the box and down here we
will find the i/o shield which they're a
little foamy back on it then we've got
the motherboard manual so you probably
won't need this if you've gone and use
the installation guide anyway and let's
get this board out so you can see
they've used a similar color scheme to
their other p55 series boards and if I
could just get this
yeah there we go okay so let's get this
thing open this actually I I'm a total
sucker for this feature I'll take the
desiccant powder out please read before
CPU installation this is so cool step
one step two step three step four and
there you go it's your step by step
guide for how to install your CPU I
really like that it's very cool so we
can pull off this which protects your
memory so okay like all p55 boards we've
got support for dual channel ddr3 RAM
and then let's have a look at the power
connector so up here we've got our eight
pin power connector only one eight pin
power connector just like the regular
p55 SLI not like before the wind then
over on the right-hand edge we've got
our 24 pin power connector so those are
both in their desirable spots we've got
kind of a slick looking chipset heatsink
but you can definitely tell that this is
a more bare-bones board because there
isn't just there's not as much on it
you've only got one PCI Express 16x slot
this one down here is going to run at 4x
and is not suitable for graphics card
use so that's really important to bear
in mind now in terms of expansion for
storage even though they've only
included two SATA cables you can get
your own cables and run up to six drives
off this board so that's pretty good to
see and I really like seeing even on a
lower end board like this their debug
code post little readout here so that
gives you any of the pertinent
information you need to know if your
board isn't posting for whatever reason
now let's have a look at the back and
they've actually included a pretty good
feature set back here so we've got a ps2
keyboard port eight USB ports clear CMOS
which really cool to see that on like I
said a lower and board we've got digital
audio in both different formats we've
got Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1 audio on
the back there so thank you for checking
out the EVGA p55 LE</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
