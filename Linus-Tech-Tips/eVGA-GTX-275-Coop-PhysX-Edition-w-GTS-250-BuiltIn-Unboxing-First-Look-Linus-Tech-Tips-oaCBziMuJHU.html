at a very unique product from EVGA this
is the EVGA GTX 275 co-op but stay tuned
there's more physics okay so normally
EVGA uses their co-op branding to mean
that there are two GPUs but unlike the
last time with the GTX 295 coop they are
not the same GPU this card
besides including Batman Arkham Asylum
which is a very cool value-add because
it's a pretty sweet game that I really
enjoyed it has two completely different
GPUs on it it has one GTX 275 okay and
then it has one GTS 250 for physics so
I'm not sure if you can read that right
there so it has a dedicated GTS 260 for
physics support that means the card in
total has 1280 Meg's of RAM on it which
is a very strange amount but that's the
896 for the for the GTX 275 and then the
rest of it is actually dedicated to the
GTS 250 so let's see what we have inside
here in terms of accessories and whatnot
so I'm just gonna aim the camera down
kind of like so so you can sort of see
what's going on here okay first thing
we've got is a OVA I'm not gonna show
you guys that is a graphics card
installation guide so that should be a
guide on how to install your graphics
card it explains PCI Express vs AGP how
to install your driver that did that did
that did it did it okay thank you Oh Oh
actually no I saw something in there
that was relevant where is it sorry nope
no not relevant never mind okay then we
have the Quick Start Guide for the
GeForce GTX 275 coop physics I'm
guessing they are going to explain to
you insert the graphic card in a PCI
Express if you're only of selling one
GeForce no no there's not really a whole
lot going on there either
okay next if the driver installation CD
don't use that throw it away download
the latest off Nvidia comm okay this is
the batman arkham asylum coupon code do
not try and read the code i covered it
up this time that's right
someone got my code for EverQuest two
off one of my other
boxing's The Killers Ino Pro but not
this time okay so in terms of
accessories in here we got there little
bit of pass-through cable ground and
spit if those are the two connectors
that are on it
you can't really read that that's okay
then we have a PCI Express ah we have
two PCI Express six pin two one TCI
Express eight ten adapter then we have a
two molex to one PCI Express six pin
adapter we've got a DVI to VGA adapter
we have a sticker to a case adapter a
sticker okay then we have a DVI to HDMI
adapter that pretty much does it in
terms of accessories then we have a cool
little EVGA kind of thing it's like the
chief of the part I really like this I
don't know why and then we have the card
itself this is a big card actually I was
not really expecting this and I can't
explain why because I should have
expected it because this card has two
GPUs on it it's not a little bit on the
big side
okay so wow that is a heck of a fan so
why don't we start with the Wow where do
you start on a card like this okay why
don't we start on the front that is the
Joker okay and that is a padded wall
that the Joker presumably resides inside
this is about an 80 mil looking fan that
has a very aggressive shape to the
blades here so you can see that it's
designed for static pressure they're
really gonna work hard to push air
through those fins inside there I'm not
really sure if you're gonna be able to
see that but that's okay yeah there you
go you can kind of see through the fins
there and then there is also a fin
structure on the other side for the
other vgr GPU which you are not going to
be able to see through for sure because
it lines up with these slots and it's
just one more obstruction okay so up at
the top we have two sli connectors so
that means you can run it with another
275 in SLI and then use your dedicated
GTS 250 for physics presumably if
someone corrects me then I will be wrong
and they will be
right now okay up at the top it's got
our little branding sticker here with
your DTX to some five o'clock physics
you got one eight pin and one six pin
power connector so that is more than a
normal 275 would have on the back you
can clearly see where the two GPUs are
located there is one right oh where are
they
it looks like there's one right here and
one right here and this one has a heat
pipe coming off of it so I'm gonna guess
that the 275 and this one I'm kind of
guessing there's one based on all the
traces that are there and based on the
fact that I can kind of see it here
would be the 250 this is presumably
covering some memory for the 250 but I'm
again totally guessing here let's have a
look at the back where we have two DVI
connectors and then we have a slot for
the case air to be exhausted out once
it's cooled off the GPU at the back this
is a standard PCI Express 16x slot so
you don't need any kind of special sli
motherboard or any kind of special
features in your computer other than a
PCI Express 16x slot in order to support
this card at the back here you can see
more cooling fins oh that would have
been a way better way to show you that
so you can see right through the card
there and that is where the cooling air
from this GPU is going to go now I'm
gonna assume there's some kind of e pipe
it's really hard to sort of see anything
on this card because it's routed below
but I think that pretty much concludes
it the main point is that Batman Arkham
Asylum the game that comes with it takes
advantage of physics really well I've
actually got a couple gtx 260 s in my
own pc and using the physics versus not
using physics made a huge difference to
my game performance thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the GTX 275 co-op edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
