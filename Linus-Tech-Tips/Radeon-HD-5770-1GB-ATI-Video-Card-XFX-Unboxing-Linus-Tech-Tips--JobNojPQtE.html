be unboxing the Radeon 5770 this is one
of four DirectX 11 cards at ATI is
launched and we're actually going to
show you the whole family shortly we'll
be unboxing the 57 50/50 on my blog next
but not quite yet and then I'm going to
do a quick size comparison against the
58 70 which is here and the 58 50 so you
can get an idea of how these cards
compare to each other so you can see
that our box is a little bit beat up
here but we're gonna find out just how
good XFX is Packaging is at protecting
the card during transport should it get
banged around a little bit
okay so let's break the seal here get
this open you can see the packaging is
actually quite similar to XFX as other
5800 series cards so you got kind of a
shoebox style package we're gonna just
pull it open oh yeah I forgot about this
this is included only with the 5770 not
with the 50 card and not with the 5800
series cards but it is a copy of
BattleForge so you peel that off for the
product key I won't be doing that today
since someone will want this card at
some point so here we've got a quick
installation guide which is just your
basics for how to install the card and
it's quite small it shows you how to
plug it into your power supply awesome
here is the installation guide so this
one covers your driver installation and
that's about it so really you shouldn't
be using this guide anyway you should be
downloading the latest drivers off ATI
comm and that brings us to our driver
installation CD ignore this download the
latest drivers off ATI comm now we've
got that I mean I think this thing's
pretty cool do not disturb on gaming
this seems to come with all of their
gaming cards easy to got your little
door hanger not that your mom's actually
going to pay attention to that she's
gonna be like no no it's time for dinner
we have one molex to PCI Express
connector so that tells us that there's
probably only one power plug on this
cart we've got a crossfire bridge and a
DVI to VGA adapter should you still
require that at this point and
we have the card itself so you can see
that even on the beat-up corner of our
box which is right here it hasn't even
gotten close to the card so there's no
risk of any damage based on what we've
seen from XFX is packaging here so let's
get the anti-static bag out and there is
the card itself so why don't we start
let's start with the connectors actually
so first of all you've got to do I
connect errs one HDMI and one
DisplayPort so this is the same
connector set as the 5800 series cards
that means you can plug in three
monitors and use this card for I
affinity this is a PCI Express 16 X card
and you can see we've got again the same
fan that they're using on the higher end
card so you can expect it to be quite
quiet because and this is another thing
you'll notice about it immediately it
only has one six pin power connector so
this is a very low power consumption
card compared to the top-of-the-range
gaming cards from the side you can see
we've got a black with red trim sort of
look with the ATI Radeon branding here
and just like the 58 50 the back is not
covered by a black shroud and it just
has a simple backplate and it also has
RAM chips on the back
unlike the higher-end cards so you can
actually see the RAM on the back should
you desire that anyway
I think that just about covers it thank
you for checking out my blog on the XFX
