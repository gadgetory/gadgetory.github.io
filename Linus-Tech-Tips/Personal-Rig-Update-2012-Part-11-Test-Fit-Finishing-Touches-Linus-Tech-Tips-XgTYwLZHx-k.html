so I've made a few more changes to the
case and I'm actually starting to put it
back together so I want to do a complete
dry run with the system assembly before
I send it off to be powered or coded
last time I got this case powder-coated
I actually forgot to send this piece
this piece and one other piece I think
it was this one up here to the powder
coater so I ended up with a few silver
pieces left I don't want to make that
mistake again I also want to make sure
that all of the cable management holes
that I've cut are going to actually help
me so the cable management holes I've
cut since last time or this one for the
front USB 3 well I've also cut a hole in
the bracket for the front USB 3 doodads
so this will be powder coated as well
don't mind the ugliness so that'll be
there I've also got some cable
management holes in the back of the
motherboard tray here so this will help
me get things like the eight pin things
like power cables for my drives this
will be great for bringing things like
24 pin up to the front and then this
will be great for things like the fans
for that radiator that's going to be in
the front bringing them down to the
basement to get power so that's the
reasoning all those I've also expanded
some of the cable management holes that
I put in the motherboard backplate so
let's go ahead and put this in
oh wait for it that's usually a good
sign there we go okay so in addition to
the CPU cut out I did last time and yes
I have sanded these down they're not
going to cut me or cut my cables I've
added a hole here which bring up the 24
I was going to bring the 24 around this
side and I still may but my wife advised
me that it should come this way in order
to not look as ugly and then this is for
SATA if I ever do you say de this is for
my front i/o so yes dry build time
without powder coating and yeah my
battery died so anyway
test fit time I've made a little bit of
progress on it per popular demand are as
whatever by popular demand the 24 pin
will not be going around the t-virus it
will instead sit right about there next
to it however that does leave me with a
bit of a challenge for what to do about
the PCIe cables because they're not
really they were designed to come out
wider the way that I did this leaving I
would have done them yeah would have
done them differently if I'd known that
I was going to be doing something
different with those like maybe I would
have I could have done twos and twos
this way and then brought them down here
instead or something like that but right
now I really really don't know what to
do with them really pleased with how
this is going to look once this is black
and it doesn't contrast as much so I can
get all of my SSDs on the back data no
problem
I got a wide in this hole up here or
well whatever you can't see that but I
don't know how he pointed at this in the
other video that I shot but ya gotta
widen that other than that I'm very very
excited about this build now that it's
finally coming together it's just time
to clean everything off and get it
powder-coated so stay tuned guys and
