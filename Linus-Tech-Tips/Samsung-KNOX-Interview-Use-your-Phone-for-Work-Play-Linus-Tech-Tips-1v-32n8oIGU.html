Master mobile featuring the jazz pro
notebook stand check it out at mobile
coolermaster USA com sure safe is the
platform for enterprises to feel
confident in rolling out Samsung devices
within their enterprise it provides on
device encryption support for VPN and
support for over 300 IT policies for
mobile device management so Knox is our
comprehensive solution for work and play
with Anna Samsung device and what what
Knox enables that safe didn't is the
ability for the enterprise just to
manage those core pieces the I prize is
interested in the applications the data
the email and context from a business
perspective while leaving all the
personal stuff your pictures of social
networks and games and all the things
that you're normally doing on your
device when you're not at work alone and
outside of their realm of influence or
control so why do we need this I guess
from both the perspective of a business
and from the perspective of the
individual consumer so from enterprise
or a business in terms of rolling up
mobile devices one of their main
concerns is the mixing of corporate data
and how do they protect their data so
it's not out there in the wild if you
will so what Knox provides them is the
security to manage that data to lock the
device down to lock down the elements
the need to check for malware so a trust
zone integrity manager to ensure that
there's no malware secure route to
prevent the device from being routed and
those first level of attacks from taking
place on the device so it gives them a
comprehensive security platform to be
able to roll out their devices from a
personal perspective one of the
challenges with BYOD is once i bring my
device into the office the office now
has access to all my personal activities
on the device they have access to my
pictures my social networks all the
things that I'm typically doing when I'm
not at work if I allow the company to
manage my device they now can what Knox
does is enable them to manage just the
work pieces while leaving all my
personal stuff for me to use myself so
then this is ultimately a solution for
people who are currently using two
devices absolutely the addressable
market we're going after with Knox is
that you don't need to have a separate
device for work on 14 play with Samsung
stock solution it is a comprehensive
ability to do all the great things on
our devices we make it
device that have mass appeal in the
marketplace at you can now take those
devices into the work and have all the
great things from a security perspective
in order to be able to manage them now
we talked about this off camera but it's
within the Knox container which
basically looks like another Android
desktop you can only install
applications from Samsung's Enterprise
approved app store there's no general
Google Play so is that going to be an
issue and how as a user how does that
how does that hamper me if I can't use
say for example something like Dropbox
can I use that on the enterprise side or
only on the personal side first so we're
working very hard to ensure that the top
enterprise and business focused
applications are available within the
Samsung app store within Samsung Knox so
right now we have over 200 applications
that will be available box and Dropbox
ShareFile cisco webex among others are
available within the Samsung Knox
solution and what we do to ensure that
is we do testing and there's an
integrity management management
capability that needs to be in place in
order to ensure that there's no malware
within the application when opened in
the context of the container on the
personal side again those applications
are well available you can download them
from google play within the container we
want to make sure that you have a tight
list of applications that meet the
security requirements of the enterprise
today and if there are applications that
they don't have that are not in our
Samsung app store and they want to
deploy anyways they're able to do that
through their MDM solution or mobile
device management solution provided
they're using AirWatch Saudi MobileIron
or absolute software which is a local
company here in Vancouver okay well I
think that pretty much addresses all the
questions that I had about Knox um you
know what guys I die I'd love for you to
click on the description in the video
and check out the forum link maybe you
can post some more questions there and I
can forward them to Samsung and see if
maybe we can get some answers to them
because i think the individual viewers
are going to be the ones who are most
affected by by all of this because it's
their their places of work that are
going to be rolling these things out so
thanks very much deep for answering
these questions for us and hopefully the
audience is as excited about this as
Samsung is well thanks for having me
it's it's a great opportunity and again
I just like to say you know Samsung Knox
is a comprehensive solution for work and
play and it really does an Ambu have the
confidence to use your device that we
normally would from a personal
perspective while giving the employed
your employer the ability to have the
confidence that it is securely managed
when it comes to their applications and
data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
