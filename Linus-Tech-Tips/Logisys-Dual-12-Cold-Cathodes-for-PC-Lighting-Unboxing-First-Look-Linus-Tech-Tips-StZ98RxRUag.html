of a popular PC modding item and that is
a dual 12 inch cold cathode kit so
basically what this is is it's a way of
lighting up your PC the particular one I
have here today is a UV cold cathode kit
so you can get in a variety of colors
including blue red green purple yellow
white and UV now the difference between
purple and UV is purple is actually
intended to throw purple light into your
case so your whole PC will blow out
purple
whereas a UV cathode kit is more
designed to allow UV reactive things
inside your case to globe whatever color
they happen to be so I mean if you look
directly at a UV cathode it will look
purple but the main purpose of it is to
be a backlight so if you're looking for
something that will actually light up
your case you're looking for a color
other than this one so why don't I
explain everything that comes with it
first of all you've got five pieces of
velcro four small ones and one big one
the four small ones are for using at
either end of the cathodes and then
mounting them to something in your case
so you stick them on really the velcro
that's included isn't great quality I'd
recommend picking up some double-sided
tape or some industrial velcro from your
hardware store if you really want them
to stay put however the big ones usually
okay and you use that to mount the
inverter now what an inverter is is it's
a device for taking the 12-volt power
from your power supply and converting
that into something that these cathodes
can use because these run on AC power
which is more like the power that you'd
find in your walls so basically you're
taking your power your computer power
supply you're turning AC into DC then
you're taking that DC power putting it
into here and putting it back into AC it
seems very roundabout but it's the best
way to run cathodes in your PC so these
are the cathodes themselves they're
twelve inches long or thirty centimeters
long they come with little white wires
attached to them I've experimented with
ways of making these look nicer you can
sleeve them quite easily so that's a
really easy way to make them look better
but you can't really lengthen them very
much because what tends to happen is the
one that you try to splice more wire
into will be more dim so it's some very
strange it shouldn't it shouldn't be
that way but it is anyway I have another
it on hand that I've already got set up
here and I'm just going to show you what
it looks like so that is a UV kit you
can see it doesn't throw off a whole lot
of light compared to the other ones but
you do have the advantage as I showed in
my mod smart SATA cable unboxing of
making other stuff glow so that effect
is very cool thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the lodge assist 12-inch
cold cathodes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
