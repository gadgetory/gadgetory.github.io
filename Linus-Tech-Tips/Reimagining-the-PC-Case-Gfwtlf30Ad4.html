2017 if you want to see all their cool
skins click the link down below we are
here at Leon Lee checking out a PCO 12
you guys have probably seen my PCO 8
that I used in the original compensator
and the newer version of that and
compensator 2 in the PCO 6 review I've
done and tons of other things we've done
with Leon Lee including their boat PC
and all that other kind of stuff but now
they have a beautiful new take on how to
do a more standard tower and I'm rather
excited now this is definitely a
prototype for a few reasons and there
isn't a full system in it but just
imagine this this entire side is for
your graphics cards you can have two and
you probably should have two if you get
this thing because it would look amazing
and they would both mount vertically
with ribbon cables coming up over the
inside nicely hidden by this black panel
on the top right behind the tempered
glass so many buzz words just happened
both graphics cards would mount
vertically right here the cable
management for them actually goes up the
ribbing that's just inside the front of
the case that will hide all of the
cables for your system that need to go
up the front and there's air flow
options for them through the front of
the case that has this really cool
removable bracket that can fit 120 or
140 millimeter fans because it would be
a little awkward to install things up
there so they've given you the option to
take that out with thumb screws and then
install your fans or your radiator or
whatever through the front of the case
then moving on to the other side of the
system you have your motherboard tray
but it is inverted it's flipped upside
down because they need those PCI Express
extensions to be able to reach over top
of the motherboard tray to get to those
graphics cards so its flipped over which
is actually a really cool effect again
you can't actually see it right now it
is not built up but it looks awesome I
love inverted motherboard trays it also
features a rubber grommet in the bottom
which can feed like your CPU power or
whatever from your power supply and
there is a CPU cutout although you're
going to want to deal with that before
installing your graphics cards because
the graphics cards will cover it up for
drives we first have to return to the
graphics card side of the case there's
two points where you can install two and
a half inch drives and they have a
little bit of a hole where you can feed
the cables through if you want to show
the drives up in the visible part of the
case or if you want to hide them in the
bottom
you can just flip them over and install
it that way then we move to the basement
there is two removable hard drive cages
which each fit two drives so in total
four drives you have two two and a half
inch and four three and a half inch
which I'm sure you can install two and a
half inch drives in if you please moving
back from there you have the power
supply area which has an external tray
because you have to feed the power
supply in from the back which is
actually kind of an easier way to do it
anyways jumping to the top of the case
there's this beautiful brushed aluminum
panel which you kind of expect because
it's Leon Lee so you're either getting
tempered glass or brushed aluminum which
is great I'm not complaining it has a
really nice looking mesh on it and if
you remove that there's a three by one
twenty millimeter fan area which can
definitely be used as a radiator space
because there is a large amount of room
in the top of this case actually it
doesn't look that tall but you have a
lot of play room for a fairly thick
radiator up there in the very front of
the case for the i/o I don't know it's
very prototype II I'm not sure what's
going to end up being here it could be
this thing which I saw at their booth
but I'm not entirely sure if it is check
out deep branch I brought to CES 2017
this year if you want a thing that looks
great they also have like metal looking
finishes which is pretty fantastic I
don't remember all the different types
but you can check yourself by going to
de brands configurator so go do that and
then come back to our channel because we
have tons of other CES content see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
