like epic dent I have on my nose right
now because I actually don't remember if
it's from James dropping a sound bar on
my face or if it was from something else
like I got hit in the face okay so
because don't sound bars usually get
matted low no no no I mean he was
holding it and dropped it on my face why
okay so I will admit that this was at
least partially my fault and I'm not
like I'm not victim blaming herself
well I provoked him I wore clothes that
made it look like I wanted a sound board
I should have known that when he gets a
sound bar and it has you know I better
steer clear so I'm not I'm not saying
that at all
I'm saying that it was actually a
coordinated effort to capture a shot
that okay I actually was at least of a
sound bar falling through the air like
what the sound bar was supposed to fall
into my hands okay so the idea was
because it was difficult with the
framing of the shot for James to just
like I mean so imagine this I'm sitting
here hosting a video to you right now
and I want to sound by all my head you
can't just stand right there cuz then
his butts taking up the whole frame so
he's he's standing like kind of behind
me and like off to the side and it's
kind of hard to hold this thing and it's
also hard for him to eyeball where
exactly is down now I think it was a
team fail over Killington says your nose
is really big huh yeah so it's funny you
know I'm gonna tell a different story
now because I remember having this
conversation with my mother at one point
when I was in high school and I said
something something something yeah I I I
took the picture this way like from the
front because from the side you can tell
I have a really big nose and she goes
you don't have a big nose and I go yeah
I did
she goes not no that's not true and I go
alright watch and she goes wow you've
got a really big nose I went yes I know
thank you I told you I have a big nose I
don't need you to inform me I have a big
nose I'm well aware of the situation
that's amazing anyway so back to the
back to the soundbar fail so James is
holding this sound bar above me and it's
kind of hard for him to line it up in
his defense
he also didn't do an amazing job okay so
the idea was I'm leaning forward I'm
talking about this other sound bar and
then I'm supposed to kind of lean back
and another sound bar supposed to fall
into my hands now I also didn't lean
back as far as I could have because I
was a little bit concerned about leaning
out of the focus of the camera and it
and like when you're trying to pull off
like a like a coordinated shot like you
know when you do the like here um ah
here here madrina this is one of our
sponsors today so here like taking
madrenas and then like you know like hit
me with it
boom like when you're trying to pull off
the like the no-look like ah yeah we got
that we didn't even look well sometimes
you don't look yeah so it came down like
this so it was really close so yeah so I
did well it wasn't that close because as
I as I outlined before and I had a
conversation with my mother once about
this something could hit me in the nose
and really not be that close to my face
okay you know this isn't that big dude
it's big enough that I remember how it's
not a small moon okay I remember having
a conversation with my wife about this
once where I was saying like oh yeah
like my face is gross right now I've got
like these breakouts and she's she's got
far worse breakouts than I do like as a
general rule no like she doesn't you
know what it's good okay lioness
relationship tips for a moment here it's
good to have
relationship where you can be honest
with each other be honest with like
hundreds of thousands people I tell her
that to her face no I know but you're
also broadcasting it to them I guess so
I mean but they have eyes look why do we
deny reality reality is important oh
that's all I was so I was complaining
about it and she's basically like you
know cut your whining because your
skin's overall pretty good and I'm like
well no the thing that's so frustrating
of those is that I can see it and she
goes what do you mean I go well it's on
my nose what you can see your nose I'm
like yes my nose takes up a significant
portion it might be Hilda beep really
yeah like I can like I can I can so okay
so I can see let's let's go with my
right uh okay with my right eye I can
see all the way to the very edge of that
light okay
okay so where my nose sticks out I can
see about to the mic stand so like you
know the effect where you hold your
finger in front of you and you can see
through both you know cuz she's Chinese
so she has a flatter face
sure yeah her eyes she can't yeah maybe
a little button but not as okay not
nearly to the same degrees but with both
eyes open if you're not thinking about
you don't generally see your nose no but
if there's a red mark like right here it
makes it a little it's really noticeable
okay it's like really noticeable yeah
people are like racist
no no physiology is not racist it just
is what it is I don't I don't make the
rules all right speaking of making the
rules let's go through some topics what
do we got today
yeah yeah until your ice Lake more
delays delayed till 2020 is Intel I
don't know if this is more delays or a
clarification on it previous I don't
know if it's more delays on ice Lake
necessarily but it L has definitely
delayed some stuff over the last couple
of years no but yeah that's what I think
this delay has already been like
realized Ryan we're being like okay this
is the date that it's actually coming we
knew it was
their stock drops 7% today I think
meanwhile AMD's picked up I think 17%
yesterday speaking of the next topic
ambi reports best quarterly profit in
seven years which to be clear when your
best quarterly profit like literally has
to be like profitable you know it's it's
good though it's good news it's good
news there's a rumor nvidia next gen
card details apparently leaking so
jensen did go up on stage saying there's
no new gaming graphics cards coming but
usually when the leaks start coming this
hard miss heavy that's an indication
that what he said might have been a big
fat what's the word that is not no no i
don't want to be disparaging o big fat
statement that wasn't entirely based on
facts given that he's the CEO and he
knows what's going on presumably yeah
have i allegedly
i actually didn't realize that stephen
colbert's been doing the allegedly thing
like years before i started doing it oh
really i thought that was our joke so
did I he does allegedly like all the
time I don't have just fine HBO's I'm
actually okay with coming up with the
same joke as Colbert and his writing
staff professionals yeah I think that's
all we need to come all out yeah oh
let's roll the intro boom oh where is it
boom
first on HBO yeah
it seemed like an insignificant
I don't have whatever it is actually um
actually it's new plus Linux or I've as
I've been caught whatever new slide so
you saw yes sorry good new you saw
Wendell's actually no I actually haven't
yet it's open on my computer
oh no he's so busy we actually like
scripted in a well actually but and he
like explains the whole good new plus
Linux thing it's it's it's pretty great
and the funny thing is like there's
gonna be Linux fanboys out there that
are like yeah you tell him Wendell but
those are the same kinds of people that
proudly refer to themselves as PC
master-race not realizing that that
whole thing was a was supposed to be a
jab like that's the whole origin of it
was that it was like a oh man words
failing me escape escape no not
sarcastic not not I thought you're
trying to say what not facetious I'm
just I'm just trying to figure out what
the satire yeah it was supposed to be a
satirical thing like you were being made
fun of so so anyone who was like yeah
you tell him Wendell you were actually
the butt of the joke I mean we actually
talked about this while he was down here
just like the biggest problem with Linux
in a lot of ways this is the second time
that I have heard about you
independently having a conversation with
him that mirrors an exact conversation
that I had with him separately without
he just happily went along with that
happening twice so funny like the
biggest problem is that when you love
something so much and that's what a lot
of the Linux community does they love
Linux so much and to be clear Linux is
good things good good thing to love but
when you love it so much that you can't
see the flaws then that's where you
start to make it hard for other people
to share your love yeah like he was
installing something and I was like so
no one's gonna put me in charge of Linux
because no one is strictly speaking in
charge of Linux
no one's gonna put me in charge but if I
was in charge this whole nonsense where
you go on like a github page copy a
string of text and then paste that into
like a terminal prompt to install
software that's gotta go
that's super gotta go hey how is this
it's 12 years 2018 the year's 2018 this
is a graphical operating system or a lot
of things there are more mainstream
alternatives to that yeah there is like
an app store style thing on many of the
districts and you can install them
because it's Linux if you're on a distro
that doesn't natively have it I mean
even the whole thing with there being so
many different distros so if you're
trying to I mean this is something that
I was talking to one of the writers
about in my office we were we were
reviewing a script and we were just
chatting about how frustrating it is to
have to deal with product names that are
all either very similar or the same so
when you're trying to find information
on a on like the MacBook like the 20 I
guess it was a 2015 so if you do yeah if
you don't know to search for 2015
MacBook non-air or like whatever or like
as a certified zone like if your Google
and you're trying to figure out what is
the MacBook someone is looking very very
good job they do a pretty good job but
if they're trying to find like a fix for
a weird bug or if they're trying to find
something like a teardown or an upgrade
guide or or a replacement part or
something stupid like that how difficult
that makes life I mean to the average
person and I feel like that's another
thing that a lot of the very techie
community loses track of to the average
person there is no awareness whatsoever
that Linux is anything other than Linux
they don't know arch devian sento they
don't know any of that stuff
it's just Linux so if you were to try to
search how to install program in Linux
we should try it
let's do it right now how to install
program in Linux I'm going to assume
that there's gonna be like alternate
stuff Oh
screen show let's have the experience in
a bracket link back hit man begin which
is pretty good a lot of people will be
running this let's go let's give it a
shot begin a geek how to install
software on Linux works differently
instead of visiting a web site you'll
usually need to grab the software from
your Linux distribution software
repositories with its package manager
I'm already dead know if I'm an average
user I'm already like okay I'm done cuz
but it realistically that is saying like
it's actually quite easy you're gonna
use the like app story kind of thing yes
it's just like that's called package
manager
so people are automatically gone that's
where you lose them from install
software from your distributions
repositories ah I mean the reality of it
is is like we we live in this sort of
this bubble where we just kind of go
well people should just people should
just learn the lingo but it's funny
because whenever you try it try stepping
outside of your usual comfort zone which
might be tech and go to a hardware store
and shop for a tool or go to a makeup
store and shop for makeup there's gonna
be the guys that know all the hardware
stuff and are in this space and there's
gonna be the people that know all the I
should have said people for both I'm
sorry don't don't be mad the people
twenty eighteen honest mistake okay
everyone the current year thing oh right
oh geez oh geez see the problem is that
we're just used to Oh bot means nothing
just hold on can't learn new tricks like
I've tried to say like five words and if
we've been here for a minute okay
the people that know both of those camps
are gonna jump into chat and be like
right but my point was to play-doh that
you don't know yeah you know walk into a
textiles store like I don't know fabric
Hannah or something and and what you'll
find is that quick
it becomes like several main different
words for plaid yeah is there
technically a little bit different and
that kind of stuff
is actually not that simple or
necessarily good use of your time to
learn when all you need that piece of
fabric for is to make a makeshift
tablecloth yeah you know you don't
really care in that so if all you really
care about doing on your computer is
reading your email you actually will
never care what a distribution
repository is and you will never care
that you don't care and you know what
that's actually fine because everybody
has different interests you know there
are actually I'm not gonna get into like
you know all the different words to
describe wine because I could that would
probably become a different conversation
but look up look up to buck chuck
winning the blind wine taste test
competition because that is a hilarious
thing that happened have you heard about
this whole story I think you've told me
about it in fact I think you've told me
on when show but from we can we can we
can let people we can let people tell us
whether they want to hear together or
not yeah yeah you know what do the to do
the TLD so the the TLDR was there was a
blind taste testing thing I don't
remember if the people doing it were
were people who were trying to become
like wine reviewer people or if they
were already wine with your people and
they had a whole bunch of different
values of wines and two buck chuck is
you guessed it a two dollar bottle of
wine and it won the competition because
because wine is BS in my in my opinion
and apparently the blind taste test
seems to agree with me but I have heard
from some wine people that there's also
examples of the other way so I don't
know who knows Oh someone wants to know
where to get my water bottle because
it's huge Amazon it's actually not that
big but it's one of the vacuum what you
need to do is - tech tips on it in black
in all black and then just sell them we
totally should accept that by the time
we marked these up even like enough to
cover receiving them labeling them and
then shipping them back out the door
they'd be like $60 water bottles I don't
remember how much
this one was it's like it's like 25
bucks or something like that 25 or 30
because it's vacuum-sealed it's big it's
got a nice wide mouth it's stainless
yeah I actually I'm very satisfied with
this water bottle would happily endorse
ten out of ten imagine this type of like
print in black like all around the ball
pretty cool with like one little bit
that just has like a safe zone around it
oh we're working on some stuff have you
seen the new the new concept for a new
hoodie no but that's exciting yeah it's
okay I don't matter like a lot more I
want to get floatplane hoodies so okay
it's not it's not like it's not like the
land hoodie like it's not necessarily a
tech hoodie that's fine but it's way
more modern in terms of like the design
what well who cares if it's not final oh
wow okay so a why are you whining about
this Nick I'm talking to Nick up there
he can hear me because he's streaming
and B why are you watching the wind show
it work okay do we watch podcasts well
we're supposed to be working Nick yeah
that's what I thought
all right so let's I will I will respect
his wishes
at least until such time as he has
provided me with a very compelling
reason why I why I should why I should
listen to him D s d sr d sr tf-x geez
man your name says then instead of
calling it a package manager literally
just call it the App Store or the
Windows Store it's the same thing that's
the point yeah but you can't do that
yeah because like if you start calling
your App Store the App Store Apple is
gonna be down your throat and up your
butt at the same time with their entire
legal team but like you could call it
something that would make sense and
would be fine but they won't yeah and
the other thing too is that it takes and
it will probably hurt the Linux culture
like people won't like it and it
actually takes a lot of it takes a lot
of branding it takes a lot of actual
marketing to get people to to get
comfortable with something
like the number of times that people
have to hear appstore to suddenly have
that be like that's the friendly
sounding version instead of you know
application marketplace or whatever
you're sure that you google chat market
when Google changed to Play Store yeah
what was it called Android Market before
yeah and and the stupid thing about it
the stupid thing about it is Here I am
giving the tech community a hard time
about not being accepting of friendlier
ways of naming things and doing things
but I had the exact same reaction when
Google called it the Play Store I was
like mad I was like okay what was wrong
with the way they did it before I don't
I don't play an app if it's not a game
that was seriously I'm pretty almost
word-for-word that was what I said okay
to be fair I literally remember this
because we were both really angry about
it and I think at that point in time
what we were angry about was that I
think we thought it was like just for
games basically because it was actually
kind of confusing when it first came out
right so it had but it had apps at the
time yeah the things that they didn't
have yet was the the deep collection of
movie news and music and TV show content
that now in hindsight almost makes it
look like Google knew what they were
doing with a branding thing but I'm
afraid to I'm afraid to be too sure
given that I'm afraid yeah because I
don't know apps torrent oh geez so
people are giving us suggestions the app
store with a zero yeah I know right
um the hack store no no the get app and
go okay this is the problem with letting
like when you let software engineers
name things get stores that's that
doesn't help with just have to put get
store after store the apt store is not
gonna make it better the pseudo store no
yeah well it would be sued ooh
okay actually okay you're more you're
more in tune with the live community
than me it's super user do what is it
pseudo or pseudo do you pronounce it the
way it said a lot of people say pseudo
but but isn't that short for sudafed
like isn't that a problem but it doesn't
matter what the like a lot of people it
is to do but how people say pseudo see
that like I say pseudo but it's sudu
okay so this is this is similar to the
jiff argument I think a little bit less
so because that's just completely BS and
this one is like it actually makes sense
I don't say I don't know I mean this
this show right now has pretty good
draft right now that's what I mean like
you don't say it that way that's so dumb
that makes no sense at all but it is
actually super user do so that makes
sense it's just kind of nicer to say
pseudo we've got I mean I can't read
that sag it's pronounced Heth sure we
should just go with if it's got a silent
G I mean we'll follow the same rules
that like modern traffic Stuart that's
what they should modern parents right
because it's just like no my son's name
is Steve and it's spelled its got like
it's silent EJ in it or whatever and
your psyche you know Steve already had a
perfectly I'm sure I'm offending someone
right now but as ladies like adults
Steve already had a perfectly good
spelling but everyone fully understood
and was familiar with like you did not
have to reinvent the wheel it's not one
of those names like like - where no one
knows how to spell it in spite of the
fact that it is 100% perfect
phonetically spelled that wrong I have
literally had my name spelled in front
of me while I'm watching I don't cry
because I don't care l io n ESS I'm just
like is that a thing that makes any
sense what a lioness oh wait a night
like a lion a lioness I didn't hear the
I I thought it was Lana in their defense
I like Lana I've had
i NIS which could somewhat be justified
I've had li na s line an okay yeah I
Nass Wow but nice I forget where I was
going
geez I so some people I worry with my
first name sometimes when I was younger
and happy a lot more often doesn't have
a very often now I bet you if I was in
Quebec or something happen all the time
oh you see yeah because your last name
is French I might I might guess Lu if
anyone spells it Luc it's not their
fault even remotely a spike I would
expect more people to do it that way
because of my last name it just doesn't
happen that often line ass tech tips
like you got the dirty tech tips yeah
all right oh yeah Tech should we do a
topic I guess I mean we're kind of at
the sponsors are we know what should we
just go full c0 copyright Katie's here

through the second episode so I've been
traveling and the waifu and i like want
to get the popcorn and watch it together
so between between the craziness that
has been going on in terms of like work
stuff at floatplane lately because
there's fun things happening and wedding
this weekend it's been like oh yeah
watch it don't you like the best man
stuff I am and I have a giant sword it's
awesome like actual though like it's
made out of steel and stuff for what is
it like a spoiler if you tell me her
it's a little bit but I doubt anyone
that's gonna I there's there's like okay
so my parents already understand it and
the only other person that I know of
that's gonna be there that's going to
watch this already knows the whole thing
so best man is a bit of a truncation it
used to be best swordsmen really and the
idea was that the best swordsman wasn't
it wasn't your best friend it was the
best person in your circle of people at
utilizing a sword and it was for very
practical reasons because back then you
used to more or less steal your wife or
someone might object to you marrying
that person because it might be in a
form of trade I object and Schwing let's
go and it would be your best man as your
champion basically your best swordsman
would be champion and creep Wow
yeah and back in the day you know how
there's the ceremony and then there's a
reception there's there's actually quite
a bit to it but you know how there's the
ceremony and then the reception this is
just kind of a funny part during the
reception the bride and the groom would
go off to consummate the marriage and
they would come back and I know what
everyone had would have dinner it's not
really how that works anymore
I mean you could probably pull it off
like technically a lot of people go off
to do a photo shoot that photo shoot
could be very naked it could it could it
definitely could yeah it's just not
generally done it yeah yeah but at that
time the best man doesn't hang out with
the other people the best man goes with
the bride and girth but not into the
room he stands guard
outside the door because to do that
you're gonna know that's the whole thing
is more there is like a Joe yes it would
be
but yeah you stand guard outside the
door because until they've completed the
the consummation the the marriage isn't
final so someone might try to come and
steal the bride before that happens so
you have to stand outside the door and
guard there's a lot there's a lot more
to it if you want to go down a really
weird path a very funny path of history
you can look it up but I'm bringing a
sword kind of as a joke it's not like a
super serious thing yeah got it thank
you for that that was both disturbing
and enlightening I appreciate it
all right so let's do a tech topic then
CJ o9b wrap posted this on the forum the
original article is from overclocked 3d
dotnet but it looks like intel may have
delayed whomp-whomp 10 nanometer ice
lake
what 2020 Wow dang I think it's 2024
server and I thought it was 2019 for
consumer something along those lines
here yeah we can have we can have a look
at this here so someone of the chat said
swords are heavy Luke yeah it's also if
it's on the ground it goes up to here on
me really it's it's an drill
it's the reforged sword it's Aragon's
blade from Lord of the Rings process
heck yeah
and it's like full steel tank throw the
entire thing it's not like you could
sharpen it and it would be very very
real it's not sharp though okay it's
freakin sweet anyways so we're not
getting ice lake and okay whatever we're
not getting anything until sometime in
2020 I guess is the point so Intel has
already acknowledged dupes Intel has
already acknowledged that they're going
to lose some server market share to AMD
and their epic architecture their epic
processors based on their Zen
architecture but this
looking pretty pretty bad this gives AMD
like a fall looks like over two years to
steal market share from Intel and in the
server space if AMD had a performance or
a cost advantage or even a significant
technological advantage for let's say
six months or even 18 months Intel
probably wouldn't care because what a
lot of consumers don't realize is that
the lead times on this kind of
technology these kinds of products and
the development process is very long so
if Intel had a product that they were
shipping let's say today right now mid
2018 that was serving the needs of their
customers reasonably well and AMD
launched some kind of disruptive
technology today Intel is already
working on like they wouldn't have a
roadmap for these processors if they
weren't doing work on them so they're
already working on the tech that they're
planning to launch in 2020 yeah now if
AMD's compelling performance advantage
got no IT departments or assisted Minh's
or super computer architects got them
looking at it and Intel could say hold
on you know we're we're working on
something by 2020 we'll be ready here
we'll get you some stuff early so that
you can make sure that you know you're
not delaying your project too much and
spec so you know how much you can build
out all that other stuff by the CPUs at
the last minute we'll have volume ramped
up by that time something like 18 months
for a project like that wouldn't be an
unreasonable amount of time to ask
someone to wait the problem is that AMD
launched Xen what a year ago it's been a
while it's been a while
aim do you launch Xen I think it was
about a year ago so now AMD is in a
position where they have a compelling
offering not just for a short period of
time but for a long enough period of
time that the managers or the
procurement officers or whoever is
working on sourcing slightly over a year
for their server hardware has had a
while to look at it see some smaller
deployments go out in the field
and start to build out a new large
project around it and then now that
intel is announcing remember worry
you're into this that there are going to
be delays well now they're starting to
look you know unreliable whereas AMD has
been hitting their targets now to be
clear epics not perfect ah it does have
some issues virtualization on AMD Zen
architecture was a big problem
especially right at the beginning but
Intel has its issues too and those are
the kinds of things that on a
project-by-project basis depending on
what you're doing with the systems might
make you lean towards one or the other
the big thing here is that AMD looks
like a legitimate option and looks like
they've gotten enough of a roadmap that
you might want to start planning long
term around them so that is really bad
news because while Intel might be pretty
happy to collect you know 320 9.99 us
from consumers for our core i7 they
would much rather take 30 to 9999 from
businesses for large orders of many
Zeon's shipped on pallets for you know
large deployments that's that's better
business so even though it's smaller in
terms of per unit sales it is much
larger in terms of the profitability
because the difference in cost between
consumer silicon and a commercial
silicon is not as high as you might
think interesting um in other news this
is supposed to by sc2 Mitch on the forum
and the original article here is
actually from AMD themselves ban Intel
news release AMD reports second quarter
2018 financial results revenue increased
53 percent year-over-year and gross
margin expanded to 37 percent that means
AMD is actually selling products
profitably we we actually I don't know
if we know how much of this was buoyed
up by the the mining craze that has
really slowed down significantly
yeah so their net income for this
reported quarter was 116 million dollars
the prior quarter was 81 million dollars
that's both of those are really really
really great compared to where they're
out a year ago which is really had a net
loss of 42 million dollars so if you
consider the fact that they were
negative 42 before they're like 116
they're almost yeah they're almost at
over 150 million more than they would
have been you mean like it's it's
actually quite quite impressive so dr.
su released a statement we had an
outstanding second quarter strong
revenue growth margin expansion and our
highest quarterly net income in seven
years
that's uh that's like CEO speak for we
made something people wanted to buy oh
yes we didn't have to slash pricing to
buy great most importantly we believe
our long term technology bets position
us very well in the future we are
confident that with the continued
execution of our product roadmaps we're
on an excellent trajectory to drive
market share gains and profitable growth
so if AMD manages to make their fabless
strategy successful Intel I'm trying to
think of who else will actually be left
who does both chip intellectual property
oh and actual manufacturing but you're
just trying to lists and I was like you
know versus focusing on fabs like a
Global Foundries or a TSMC or focusing
entirely on IP like someone like arm arm
doesn't build their own processors but
of course they are doing super duper
well in the mobile age of low-power
devices thanks to licensing they're
their designs to other brands like
Qualcomm for example to produce
processors at an actual theft so
Qualcomm doesn't actually fabricate
anything either Nvidia doesn't fabricate
anything you've got some of the world's
most successful semiconductor companies
that don't actually manufacture
semiconductors yeah there's micron still
making SSDs so micron is in a
partnership with Intel and they do NAND
flash but I don't believe micron would
actually produce the CPUs so that's sort
of different I would say DRAM and NAND
flash manufacturing are kind of separate
from IC manufacturing yeah
just cuz and and I'm just basing that on
that I don't think there's anyone other
than Intel that actually does both no
Samsung Samsung as well so Intel and
Samsung are in both games but as far as
I know they're the only ones that are
left in both crazy it's actually quite
different compared to like ten years ago
Nvidia is next gen car details so this
was posted by Atlas Wraith on the forum
and rumor it is of course WCC F Tech so
yes it's a rumor but they are saying is
an exclusive rumor
they've got one of the Star Wars Edition
cards that looks like is that they yeah
yeah one of the Star Wars Edition cars
they're just using that as a placeholder
that is not probably what the card will
look like is that why you're questioning
oh I just know I was looking at I was
looking at this here and I couldn't
remember if that was what it looked like
but then I saw the is that kind of looks
like Rebel Alliance but technically it's
the whatever the Jedi Order or something
that was so stupid that whole thing
galactic empire and then Jedi Order even
though they never I did like a whole I
did like a whole thing I pulled people
into the board room and I got like a
slide up and I was I was yelling about
it it was it was kind of a bit for a
video but it was something that they the
inspiration for it came from so I get up
and I'm like okay so here's the timeline
alright here's where the Jedi Order
exists here's where the Galactic Empire
exists and we've got about a sliver of
overlap or you could arguably say that
they both existed but they're never in
direct conflict with each other none of
this makes any sense why are these the
new teams who even knows what the Jedi
Order is from a mainstream standpoint
who knows what this is so that's all I
kind of go off about it and the
inspiration was that I was I was working
on the script with someone about
something okay and I went off into a
tangent about this and they're like this
is hilarious we should just work this
into oh you know so a month ago the
writer here
Guzman prasada and there's another
co-writer co-writer Hassan muj mujtaba
I did my best I talked about how AI B's
would be seated within videos
next-generation graphics cards probably
based on the touring architecture
sometime in late August ba ba ba ba bla
blah blah blah let's not try and read
the article let's look at our notes
provided by James instead one random
sorry Star Wars thing they're
relaunching the Clone Wars animated
series I'm talking about it last week
and I said on the show I was like Luke's
gonna be so disappointed that he's not
here and so disappointed that they're
just like wrapping it up as a fanservice
thing yep
not only are they just wrapping it up
but I am both excited and scared as
freakin heck because I have not enjoyed
the new Star Wars stuff under Disney so
like oh geez and that none of that was
Disney they asked Clone Wars immediately
when they bought it
they axe it partway through a season
like you can actually find you can you
can get the Lost episodes I'm not gonna
talk about this for too long it's where
you get the lost episodes which is like
a few of the completed ones from that
season and then you could also find the
art and some of the scripts for the
episodes that they like didn't really
properly do it all you find like uh Nana
mated scenes and stuff I'm like if I was
the the Clone Wars team and Disney came
to me and was like yeah so we want to
like close it out but like here's how
we're doing it what are the odds that
assuming that you have found work
elsewhere because it's been a while now
well you know so assuming you found work
elsewhere what are the odds that you
just drop what you're doing and you come
back yes Disney I will come in and I
will I will do it your way like I got a
I gotta imagine that it's gonna be a
slightly different team working on this
okay so I don't know this this is an
assumption that I'm based I have no
source for I'm extremely unsure
this is beyond rumor but I think the
cone wars team moved on to rebels okay
and then reveled the reason why rebels
feel so different it's because rebels
has a lower target audience not because
it's necessarily a different team but I
could be completely wrong about that so
aggressively don't quote me on that but
I think they might have
at least the core people still around
alright so here's what's going on with
Nvidia is new line up wow this could
actually be very bad news so they are
apparently they haven't decided on the
naming which might not seem like it
matters that much because ultimately who
cares is about FPS but as a general rule
it's not a terrible idea
when you create a product to have the
name kind of make sense um um I'm with a
graphics card really the main thing that
we expect a name to tell us is where
does its performance fall in relation to
other cards so apparently they are
actively considering suffixes like xxx 5
for example GTX 1175 yeah
or GTX 2070 or 2075 now that alone
doesn't sound like that big of a deal
unless the kinds of suffixes they're
considering are like 10 something 5
where it's possible that we might get
GPUs that don't actually perform that
dramatically different from this gen now
I don't think like they've done that
sort of thing before like the 275
launched way after the 260 in the 280
yeah but that was similar architectural
II I don't see them launching a new
architecture without giving it a clear
new series but if they used numbers that
kind of seemed like they'd positioned
them between older cards I don't know if
it would I don't know if it would
surprise me that much either because you
got to remember if Nvidia holds true to
the pattern that has been true since the
GTX 680 we are not getting big tearing
at the initial launch we are getting
mid-sized tearing so a GTX 10 atti is a
very different card from a 1080 they
there they are they're more different
than a 1080 and a 1070 are that's the
way it works now 1080 Ti is a big chip
and 1080 and 1070 are both stepped down
mid sized chips so we are getting the
new generation mid chip which I don't
know may or may not actually perform any
better than last gen big chip
we're gonna actually make a compensator
I don't know if we get a new big chip so
we kind of skipped three sort of Italy
sort of hang so there wasn't a usually
there's like a very opportune moment
well before we SLI anymore yeah that
doesn't help yeah well like it isn't
there for specifically benchmarking
reasons no he hate it when people do
that though maybe but it's really done
stupid Stalin was cool apparently will
initially have three power brackets 120
150 180 wat what's interesting about
that is NVIDIA has over the last several
years anyway gone with a staggered
rollout for their new lineup oh that
piece was a little spicier well I'm time
run time the sweet sriracha yeah that
piece was a little bit on the spicier
side it's good though actually so
they've gone with a very staggered
rollout so they've gone like okay here's
the high end let me like wait a couple
months okay here's the next one
wait a couple minutes here's the next
one that allows them to kind of stretch
out their PR coverage yeah
keeps people from kind of getting bored
of like this wave of GPS gives us more
stuff to target and nothing for two
years you know but what this sounds like
is that at one hundred and twenty
hundred and fifty hundred eighty watt
they might be doing a broader refresh
and the reason for doing that might be
that AMD is actually relatively
competitive at the hundred and twenty
watt TDP range so they might want to
just go you know what let's just go blob
and make life very very difficult for
our one competitor in the space all in
one go very interesting it is rumored
that 1080 TI MSRP will drop by a hundred
dollars and 1080 MSR people drop by
fifty bucks this is also a solid
indication that the upcoming 1180 and
1170 I'm just using those as
placeholders don't really perform that
amazingly differently than the ones that
they are replacing yeah we'll see but
potential price drops on 1080i in 1080
that's never a bad thing happens
every time and is never anything we
actually filmed our MacBook Pro 2018
video today so there's gonna be more
detail about this and that but it looks
like the throttling for the MacBook Pro
has been fixed in Mac OS so it came as
an update to High Sierra 10 13.6 and
they have issued an apology to consumers
who experienced less than optimal
performance on their new 2018 machines
now they said that this was a firmware
patch I'm missing the usual key issued
with this update but Anthony's testing
shows no performance change in Windows
after downloading and installing this so
it seems like it didn't actually make
any changes to firmware and we'll talk a
little bit more detail about that in our
Matco video Oh Facebook Facebook stock
crashed harder than any stock has ever
crashed before this is supposed to by
sc2 Mitch on the forum they were
apparently sued today over a
disappointing earnings announcement okay
I didn't know about that Wow but it
resulted in the loss of a hundred and
twenty billion dollars of shareholder
wealth making it the biggest one-day
loss in US market history
apparently Zuckerberg went down like two
spots on the world's richest list or
something
really yeah um you heard of okay this is
I do not recommend going there I would
never recommend going there and it takes
a bit of willingness to read terrible
horrible things to be able to go there
but there is a subreddit called Wall
Street bets and it's it's based around
like all all stock investments is
essentially betting right but this is
based around like hardcore betting and
their idea isn't like I'm gonna invest
so I can have a good good life leading
forward their ideas like I'm gonna Yolo
so that hopefully I either get a yacht
or nothing and like some dude is 20 and
made like five hundred thousand dollars
off shorting Facebook and he posted
about it there there's also a dude who
had a 50 I think there's a fifty five
thousand dollar portfolio
and then went down to 1.2 grand because
of this it's a really interesting read
right now just fair warning it gets
pretty brutal in in the comments and
stuff so just if you have a weak stomach
for people being being vicious don't go
there but it's really interesting seeing
people who bet super hard on stocks and
then something like this happens and
just seeing what happens people losing
their entire savings people being
completely set up for the entire rest of
their life just like it's every single
threat is like it's like a livestream of
the high roller you know roulette table
yeah pretty much it's crazy it's a very
crazy yeah here's a rumor this was
posted by aluminium Tech on the forum
and the original source is nine to five
ghoul fortnight is coming to Android but
it is rumored that it will be a Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 exclusive at first they
must have paid so much for that so
apparently it's going to be so the note
9 which is set to be announced on the
9th of August with pre-orders on August
14th and public availability on August
24th looks like it's gonna have
fortnight exclusively for a month and
there was a thread about this on the
forum where people were like oh what are
they you know more they stupid they
think people are gonna buy a phone just
over a game yeah oh yeah it's like
people are criticizing Samsung ok you
can criticize Samsung all you want but
they're saying that Samsung is stupid
for doing this no depending how much
they paid which I don't know depending
how much they paid this might be
actually brilliant it's not inherently
stupid it could be stupid it could be
stupid yeah like if they paid way too
much money maybe it's stupid but
remember this is a company that buys
Super Bowl ads so you know if they paid
a hundred million dollars this is a far
better promotion than a Super Bowl ad if
you want my honest opinion and one you
were just talking about like it might
actually influence their decisions think
about if you're on a contract how
subsidize your phone is it's just a bit
of money right so it's it's probably
like $150 decision but they're all gonna
be about a hundred fifty bucks or zero
dollars you pick this phone you get you
get fortnight
and you get the decision between
wireless AKG headphones which yes sweet
yeah you should probably go with that
unless you're a crazy for a night fan
the other option is a hundred to a
hundred dollars worth of v bucks in one
hundred two hundred and fifty yeah and
you the thing the other thing you gotta
remember is that fortnight has an
enormous fan base so you you've got
friends that work at like mobile gaming
companies radios what do you remember
talk I know you've talked to them about
it but do you remember what they said
was the percentage of the users that are
your whales oh I don't remember the
exact number but it is very very small
so I got like less than 1% so then
you've got hundreds of millions of users
though and you've got these whales that
might spend hundreds of dollars a month
on the game to imagine that they might
run out and buy a phone so that they can
play the game that month no quick
remember they get a phone yeah I mean
usually when they spend a couple hundred
bucks on this game they don't even get a
phone hey yo I got a phone cool like
that is a no-brainer for the kind of
people that are spending lots and lots
of money on digital content for games
like fortnight so oh yeah they're gonna
sell some phones don't kid yourself
okay last topic for today Apple will fix
devices damaged by Japanese floods for
free Apple is buying themselves some
free positive publicity and hey that's a
good thing one quick thing I'm going to
step in here with you just mentioned the
like tiny percentage of your users are
the whales there's a really amazing
story Kevin Lee Co a 45 year old man
from Rocklin California pled guilty to
charges of wire fraud and money
laundering having been caught stealing
4.8 million dollars from his employer
between 2008 and 2015 1 million dollars
of which he spent on game of war the
mobile game one thing that blows my mind
about this is imagine literally how many
times he would have had to click to buy
something to spend a million dollars
like it literally would have been
tiresome to like spend that much money
on in-game currency I'm surprised he
didn't manage to lose his job given how
much time he was clearly spending
playing game of war
yeah I mean okay no I'm sorry I mean I'm
sure he lost his job
ignoring the money laundering oh yeah
it's like what was this guy even getting
done all day it's really nothing yeah a
million dollars on game of war oh my
goodness so crazy all right
so this was posted by red round 2 on the
forum and Apple has announced that it
will repair any iPhones Mac's iPods or
iPads
maybe iPod owners are getting some love
that's nice that were directly damaged
by the devastating heavy floods that
swept through Japan this month that's
cool the flooding has caused hundreds of
deaths and the support goes against
Apple's standard repair policies which
strictly exclude water damage so almost
all of Apple's main product lines are
eligible but accessories are not
included and proof of ownership may be
required that's fantastic way to go
Apple that's very cool this probably
gonna cost them a lot of money yeah I'd
love to hear that though speaking of
things I love to hear I'd love to hear
that that's it for this week I'm gonna
go home enjoy my weekend we gotta play
some badminton yeah yeah not this
weekend but yeah very soon yep I'm also
I need to fix my back first and my arm
what you do with your back in your arm
what are you not broken
my knees are basically fixed no that's
not my point
it was great my knees are almost fake so
my lower back I think it's my chair I've
ordered a new chair
okay the we're still using that horrible
like I don't like spending but you told
me we're gonna order a new chair it has
been ordered literally chair literally
before floatplane was founded yeah
before that project was even started so
it probably was like mid 2016 yeah yeah
little bit yeah I ordered it now though
it's showing up on August 6 I'm excited
what'd you get its I don't want to talk
about it is it expensive it's very
expensive Herman Miller yes oh I talked
to a whole bunch of ergonomic experts I
talked to because my like oh there's a
history of back problems in my family
too so I want to like solve it and
that's part of the reason why it took me
two and a half years to order it it's
because I've kind of known the one that
I should order for a long time it's not
that it's not the main one it's nothing
one
stupefy but this is the chair you'll use
for the rest of your life right it has
like a 25 year warranty or something
okay like it's supposed to I mean I'm a
firm believer in buying one nice thing
once yeah so the number of times that I
have not upgraded my wireless router
since I spent $1,000 on a ruckus access
point has probably gotten me about a
third of the way there so far yeah and I
plan to continue to use that ruckus
access point for many years because even
though there are new wireless standards
coming that will be faster the devices
that I'll be able to afford will if I
were to buy something enterprise tier
will be consumer grade and they're gonna
have other issues and quite frankly I
get to on my blade stealth I was
transferring files to mine as at 46
megabytes a second yeah on my access
point at home two nights ago that is
good enough for me on Wi-Fi if I mean
faster than that I will plug into a
network connection and I will get 10 gig
because you know Yolo or whatever so I'm
a firm believer if you're gonna use
something for long enough that you would
have replaced it multiple times with
commodity garbage in the time that you'd
use it then I consider that a solid
investment because you also have to pay
yourself for the time that it takes to
go and buy a new chair several times
assemble it go shop for it figure out
that you're missing a stupid bracket go
back to the store and go to the bracket
wall and find the right stupid bracket
then take it home like there's there's
overhead associated with think there's
dealing with buying stuff even a the
biggest one out or even say is shopping
downtime
oh yeah downtime is if your router goes
down especially for someone like you
yeah like you just did the you did the
angry job movement and the I roll like
that's it
it's a problem it could be very very
impactful like I might not be able to
get work done or I might be
live-streaming at my house or something
back in those days anyway if my router
went down I would live here until I got
a new one which would be the next
morning because I would need one
immediately like it's so that's it for
winch oh thank you guys for tuning in we
will see you again next week we are
actually going to be discussing moving
where and show to you two
whoa yeah maybe we should talk about it
on the land show next week
well maybe do some pros and cons will
talk to the twitch audience but see what
they think
what about weird so like against
everyone's policy I think so Oh kind of
it depends it depends all right all
right you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
