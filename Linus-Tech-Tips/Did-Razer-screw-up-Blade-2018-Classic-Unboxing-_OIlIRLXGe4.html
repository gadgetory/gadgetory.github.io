means that I can't do any benchmarks and
I can't do any thermal testing or
anything like that but if you guys have
been following along with me for the
last couple of years you'll probably
know that while I wouldn't describe
myself as a razor fan by any stretch of
the imagination
sorry racer I am partial to their
laptops whether it's the blade formerly
blade 14 formerly blade 14 year 2014 or
whatever or the blade stealth which has
actually been my daily driver lately
so when Razer offered to send over their
new blade 15.6 whatever it is they're
calling this thing their latest
cutting-edge gaming laptop for an early
sneak preview I couldn't resist
humblebundle lets you save money on
games while supporting charitable causes
and you can learn more at our link in
the video description so any first look
starts with the unboxing experience oh
oh you want to see oh sure here so this
has actually been opened up already by
Tyler because he had to take it out and
put a label on it all that kind of stuff
so I'm getting like that this is a very
subpar subpar on box this is like sloppy
seconds unboxing experience that's okay
I think I think I'll get over it
so they have actually finally changed
their packaging for the blade and I
think they managed to make it even more
bare-bones which is a feat so you get a
letter from this is interesting he
changed his title we've dropped the
chief gamer charade ha good for them you
get some instruction manuals you get a
microfiber cloth you'll need one of
those and you get a shiny multicolored
Razer logo with some other Razer chroma
stuff that you can stick all over here
your stuff you also get a plea not to
return the Razer has revised their power
brick because of the increased power
requirements of this new blade so gone
is the sleek small rounded hundred and
sixty five watt brick and here is the
200 watt sort of block here and larger
bricks the one thing that they did
manage to keep is my least favorite
thing about it and it's the right angle
cable that comes off of it like this is
the problem with it this happens all the
time it puts constant strain on it and
while they've reinforced it and it's wow
it's really thick I'm still really not a
fan of that design so if you were hoping
for type C power you will be sorely
disappointed not only do you not get a
standard power connector you get a new
proprietary one from Razer that I have
not seen before fortunately it's
reversible so you can plug it in either
this way or that
I'm gonna go with this way so my initial
impression when I first touched this was
that it was a lot bigger than the old
blade fourteen even though razors
marketing is all about how it's a really
similar size but what I also thought was
that maybe I just felt that way because
I've been using the blade stealth as my
daily driver lately and that one really
is a lot smaller like we're talking an
inch here an inch and change there but I
think what makes it feel so big is not
just that it is taller so you can see
it's got a significantly higher profile
off the table almost the entire
thickness of the screen even though it's
actual X&amp;amp;Y dimensions aren't that
different those are really close but the
squareness makes it feel just because of
kind of its its sharpness and blockiness
it makes it feel a lot bigger really not
sure if I prefer this new design
language from them on the bottom there's
another big change here too so while
these feet used to hold the blade a
little bit off the table that was
actually one of the fundamental problems
with its design was it had a hard time
sucking air into these bottom fans now
they're really tall like they're less
you know anti-slip feet and they're more
like a built in laptop stand to hold the
thing off the table and you should be
able to really see that if I put it up
next to the other one another big change
is that those two bottom fans are now
actually metal blades as far as I can
tell so they're super thin blades they
should be more efficient and because
they're jamming up to a gtx 1070 in this
thing you can also see a huge change to
the way that they're doing the venting
at the back so in the old blade it was
just like the old mac books where it
came out from behind the hinge here and
then the air vented up towards the
screen now air gets sucked in here and
it can go out any which way it can come
out these holes here it can go out this
way and it's like quite open in fact you
can even see
that the display cable is exposed there
that is a very strange design choice I
have never seen anybody do that before
but for all the bigger Vernis we're
definitely getting some benefits so
we've got Thunderbolt 3 yet again we've
got a USB 3 HDMI and been asking for
this for a while mini DisplayPort on the
one side so you can drive up to three
displays off of this thing externally at
a time that's freaking awesome then
we've got a couple more USBs and a
headphone microphone combo jacks so we
do get an i/o upgrade for the size
increase and of course all of the
internal upgrades so they're now
shipping with 8th gen core i7 processors
so that's up to six cores GTX 10 60s or
10 70s and I think we've got that's 110
60 or 110 70 and I think we've got more
competition to thank for all of that
stuff because Razer has done hardly
anything with this design over the last
four years but now this really does look
like a 20-18 notebook my biggest
complaints about the last gen blade were
the very outdated looking thick bezels
the 60 Hertz refresh rate which in my
mind is unjustifiable on a gaming
machine in this day and age and the
lackluster performance being limited to
a GTX 1060 rather than up to a 1070 even
if that 1070 is a max q1 so that's a
lower TDP version and they've actually
fixed some things that I hadn't even
really complained about that much
so like the blade stealth the regular
blade now has an oversized trackpad and
really it's especially noticeable if you
go and put the old one up next to it
but one thing I have to confess I'm a
little disappointed about is they've
actually done away with the hardware
clicky button something that I I really
like and I do use in place of just sort
of push a push in trackpad one that
doesn't have like it's hinged up at the
top so it doesn't have an even amount of
force required
everywhere that you press on it you know
even though it feels a little stiffer
it's not Anna it's not in a bad way
there's less key wobble already like
that's something that was a bit of an
issue with the old blade definitely some
backlight bleed I can even see it in the
studio lighting but I'm not gonna ding
them too hard on that when this is a
pre-production model the thunderbolt
connector is still on the right which is
a real drag because that's where my
mouse goes so we've got some dongle
Mouse interference and this power button
was an opportunity to include a touch
sensor in 2018 everything should have
biometrics even if you choose not to use
it and they've opted not to include
either IR emitter windows hello or a
touch sensitive power button both of
which make logging into the machine a
lot faster so the two different
resolutions they're shipping 1080p at 60
Hertz so that's the one that starts at
1899 which to me is crazy a $2,000
gaming laptop with a 60 Hertz display or
1080p with 144 Hertz
those are both meant to be the gaming
models and then what's interesting to me
is the 4k one so the gaming one has a
hundred percent srgb coverage while the
4k one has a hundred percent Adobe RGB
coverage and because it's 4k only a 60
Hertz refresh rate and touch so what's
interesting about that to me is it seems
like razors actually only got 1080p
gaming models and then the 4k one is
positioned more like a creative or
professional option man with the game
running over a hundred and forty-four
frames per second this looks so smooth
even though every machines chips with 16
gigs and I don't disagree with that
configuration what's really cool is that
it is now upgradeable for the first time
on a razor blade so I shouldn't have to
be impressed by that but it's 2018 so I
am and acoustics I mean that was the
first thing Brandon asked was is it as
loud as the old one
reserving full judgment for the full
review but actually it's not bad so far
like even though I've had this running
for 10-15 minutes now so we're at full
heat it doesn't have that shrill whine
that the old blade did though I've yet
to see how it behaves with the 1070
max-q
so on the surface the all-new blade and
that really does seem to be what they're
calling it address is pretty much every
complaint I had about the way that the
old blade was aging it's got two more
CPU cores it's got a bigger display it's
got a high refresh rate display but the
industry has come a long way since the
original blade and the competition is a
lot better so whether I would recommend
it over something like an Asus Zephyrus
is gonna come down to raw performance as
well as thermals in acoustics and for
that we need a finished unit so stay
tuned guys because this is going to be
an interesting showdown speaking of
interesting private Internet access is
an interesting choice for your VPN PIAA
supports a variety of VPN protocols and
types of encryption and authentication
allowing you to dial in the exact level
of privacy protection you need we've got
apps for Windows Mac OS Linux Chrome
Android iOS and support for more
platforms coming in the future and their
apps include DNS leak protection and
ipv6 leak protection they've also got an
Internet kill switch which will block
all traffic if the VPN becomes
disconnected unexpectedly and you can
check it out today at the link in the
video description it is surprisingly
affordable so thanks for watching this
