new Cosmo a fun and highly interactive
little robot that functions both as a
toy and a pet heard that before and been
disappointed I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised this time as they
didn't just use a team of highly skilled
engineers but they also worked with
people that used to work at DreamWorks
and Pixar to do the animations and game
design this creates a dynamic
combination of artificial intelligence
interactive content animatronics along
with vision and sensing technologies
that create not just an awesome robot
but a personality or a character now
let's go meet Cosmo this is Cosmo and
he's not perfect but he isn't intended
to be he's designed after AI flawed but
lovable little hero r2d2 and bb-8 aren't
the most advanced droids in the Star
Wars universe but you love them because
they have character like Cosmo Cosmo can
detect who you are and greet you like
this and he has emotions like confidence
excitement happiness bravery and more
sometimes he will fail and he will
complain about that or you'll be playing
a game with him and he will respond
happily or sadly depending on if he is
winning or losing
he gets surprised when he encounters new
people or objects or even the ever
dreaded a table ledge he feels real it's
kind of like playing with a dog sure
playing the game like drawing a stick or
ball is somewhat entertaining but the
really fun part is interacting with the
dog the best part of Cosmo is well
interacting with Cosmo and the games are
mostly a facilitator for that although I
must say I did get a little competitive
with the quick tap games as you're just
screwing around or completing daily
goals you will earn bits to upgrade
Cosmo or unlock new games and by the way
you'll never have to pay for these with
real money just easily acquirable
in-game currency and there should be a
lot of them as the Anki team claims they
have a multi-year roadmap for future
upgrades and along with that you also
get sparks which are kind of like dog
treats they can be used to prompt Cosmo
to show off and do a little trick
but as we were saying before sometimes
Cosmo will fail at these tasks that you
have given him instead of acting like
you might expect a robot to act by just
repeatedly trying over and over again
Cosmo will get sad and lose confidence
resulting in him possibly trying the
task in a different way or maybe even
switching tasks altogether yet again
making him feel more real say he screws
up big time and fails to recognize a
table ledge causing him to fall off
first off he's rather durable and should
be fine secondly however he will express
major displeasure he will lack bravery
and confidence for a while just like a
non robotic being on the flip side when
Cosmo is excitedly doing fun things and
succeeding he will check in with you
from time to time making eye contact
calling your name just like a happy kid
would and he'll go around and do a bunch
of different things lots of what gives
Cosmo this great personality is subtle
as it should be the emotional algorithms
huge library of animations dynamic
interaction incredibly awesome eyes if
you haven't noticed and even a
soundtrack they aren't necessarily
things you would actively think about
but together they make a wonderful
experience now let's look more in depth
at what's happening under the hood most
of the computational power for Cosmo
including AI computer vision etc is done
through your phone meaning you need to
be connected at all times to cosmos
Wi-Fi network so just as a note this
does mean you won't be connected to the
internet on your phone while this does
sort of suck to be honest this is good
for another reason which is very
possibly more important to you you're
always offline meaning that no pictures
or video are taken no voice is recorded
your private conversations with Cosmo or
things that he sees and hears are yours
and don't go anywhere else this also
means that as your phone becomes better
Cosmo can - with various software
upgrades you can enhance Kosmos
activities behaviors and interactions
Anke has a multi-year roadmap as we
mentioned earlier for future upgrades
but if you want to make your own or were
I on other people's creations they offer
an extensive Python SDK with great
documentation available at developer on
comm robotics programming has a crazy
learning curve
computer vision path planning 3d world
modeling all these things are highly
difficult and this API can make them
easy with simple imports and function
calls and if you're more interested in
the artsy animation side of things
however do not fear there will be a Maya
animation kit with JSON output available
later on now cosmo is made up of 320
individual components and it took 45
entire mechanical iterations to achieve
his final form in the end for computer
vision they ended up with a forward
facing camera and a cliff sensor the
cliff sensor is on the bottom of cosmo
and will mainly be used to keep him from
falling off of tables the camera is used
to detect faces and familiar objects
with QR code style identifiable images
on them having a standard size for these
images enables cosmo to detect how far
away they are and if they're on an angle
which is great but for things he doesn't
know about he can use the camera to map
them into his environment so he knows to
stay away lest he bump into them a lot
of this tech is in place to avoid what
is called robot kidnapping or the idea
of picking up cosmo and putting him
somewhere else screwing up his carefully
constructed map he will then be able to
find objects that he is used to seeing
like one of the boxes that has a QR code
on it map its position in the space and
then try to figure out where he's at
it's a smart little way to make him not
be constantly constantly confused while
you're interacting with him now put all
of that together into a cute little
robot along with all the things I
mentioned earlier and you've got a
gifted little guy with a huge amount of
tricks under his sleeve he's mischievous
and a lot of fun and I'm excited to
check them out when they start shipping
to Canada and other places outside the
US if you are to go to a key calm slash
