something kind of neat this is the mush
kin Ridgeback heat spreader so the
particular kit that I had today is a
redline ddr3 2 by 4 gig kit and what
this kit has that's pretty special about
it
first of all it has the honor and
privilege of being featured on my tech
tips test bench I will be replacing my
my kingston hyperx h2o modules which
i've been using for quite some time
those are ddr3 2000 kits 2 by 2 gig so
these are a 2 by 4 gig kit so they'll be
replacing my hyper X h2o kit and while
they are clocked lower so these are ddr3
1600 megahertz modules pc3 12800 what's
cool about these guys is that they have
very tight Layton sees especially for an
8 gig kit so this is a c7 kit 7 9 8 24
to be precise while still maintaining
the 1.65 volt sealing necessary on the
latest Intel Core i7 core i5 and core i3
platforms so I'll be using this with my
P 67 a GD 65 motherboard as well as my
core i7 2604 point 7 gigahertz to bring
you guys all of the latest benchmark
scores from whatever I happen to be
reviewing on my test platform whether
it's an SSD or a video card or whatever
else so thank you for checking out my
unboxing oh actually know you want it
you want to see this from every angle
cuz these are like these look sweet
we've got like the ridgeback going on
them they're actually really sharp
looking modules I love the paint finish
on them too because so many so many heat
spreaders on Ram as soon as you touch
them like this to install them you're
gonna leave big fat indelible
fingerprints on them but these use like
a nice like a slightly textured finish
on what appears to be like like powder
coated paint like it's just it's a
really nice finish and there's no way
you could possibly damage it when you're
installing your modules so thank
projecting on mine boxing don't forget
