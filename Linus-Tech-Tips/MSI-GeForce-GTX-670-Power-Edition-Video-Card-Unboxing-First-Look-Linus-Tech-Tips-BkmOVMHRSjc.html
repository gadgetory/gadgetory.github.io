the msi gtx GeForce GTX 670 power
edition so this is unique because it has
triple voltage that is then tensed power
delivery design which allows you to
actually over volt the GPU which
reference boards can do so you can use
MSI Afterburner which is conspicuously
missing its little badge on the front
there it is you can use MSI Afterburner
to overclock this graphics card
significantly better probably in theory
you know I can't guarantee overclocking
results then a reference GTX 670 or even
a non reference GTX 670 that doesn't use
their you know military class beefy
components as well as their unique
voltage controller design that actually
allows the part to be over vaulted
because normal GTX 670 s have some
trouble with that so here we go triple
over voltage by MSI Afterburner so
voltage adjustment of GPU memory and PLL
by afterburner military class three
components we've come to expect this
from these guys so they're super ferry
chokes highly conductive capacitors
capacitors capacitors and solid caps and
this afterburner we've talked about
already it has PWM design enhances
overclocking stability okay got it
and medias comment to twin further
thermal design ah yes so uses their Twin
Frozr cooler this uses a twin
ah hey Alex does this use twin throw
through three or four okay thank you
we've actually got Alex here from MSI
will be film these and then I have to
give these back to him to take with him
because he needs them for some kind of
sort where you going he says he's going
to Alaska with them but I don't believe
that for a second so dual molex to 6-pin
PCI connectors you've got two of them in
terms of included accessories you
usually find those with MSI cards down
here DVI to VGA as well as you know
users guide driver disk you don't need
and all of that normal stuff now let's
get into the graphics part itself so the
most unique thing about this card as I
said before is not what you're gonna
find on the card how
it does have their Twin Frozr for cooler
so Twin Frozr keeps evolving the
original Twin Frozr was just two fans on
it you think between frozer to added
super pipes the Twin Frozr 3 added the
propeller blade fan switch with their
coating at the end here is less
conducive to noise production or less
less noisy because of the way that the
turbulence is reduced as well as the
inclusion with twin throws or four is
the fact that the heads bend backwards
for a little while before spinning
forward which is helpful for reducing
dust buildup on the heatsink itself
because you can build the best heatsink
in the world but then you take it up
with dust and it doesn't work at all so
so that's that's all the different
things that have gone into trim Pro so
it also looks cooler now than it used to
kart design so check this out it has a
full board I don't know how much you can
see it but you see here it has a full
board yoona sync that actually adds to
the structural rigidity of the board as
well as increasing cooling so any
components that need cooling you can see
they have thermal pads for things like
RAM right there so they're making
contact spreading that heat out and any
components that don't need cooling are
popping up through it so you just like
that however that's not to say they're
not getting any cooling anyway because
the design of the Twin Frozr cooler
blows air down over the entire PCB
anyhow you find most of the other stuff
that you're used to dual DVI display
port as well as HDMI out so this is a
GTX 670 3d visions surround off of a
single card and with the 670 you can
actually get away with that and however
with some of the lower end stuff you
aren't going to be able to run three
displays at 1080p and 3d and at any kind
of you know decent frame rate I mean
this is probably where I would start and
then maybe add another one if you're not
happy with the frame rate
speaking of adding another one GTX 670
does support up to four-way SLI so one
two three or four cards all supported
and you got ah yes non-reference PCB so
we've talked about this a little bit
already but the reference GTX 670 PCB is
like here it cuts off here so there's
just not as much room to put on beefy
power components and to have the power
connectors at the
end of the board which is a little bit
better for cable management and to just
have more room to lay things out rather
than cramping them altogether so that's
the advantage of getting a non reference
card for something like a high end GPU
like a GTX 670 so I think that pretty
much covers it thank you for checking
