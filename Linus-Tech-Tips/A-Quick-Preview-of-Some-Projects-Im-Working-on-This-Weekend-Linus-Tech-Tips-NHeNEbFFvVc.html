going to be working on over the weekend
first of all I've got my zotac gtx 480
that i unboxed the other day and
actually did an NCIX tech tips episode
regarding well I guess the value of a
lifetime warranty and then next over
I've got an adaptec 5445 raid controller
card it's hooked up to three hits a tee
1 terabyte drive so this is going to be
a part of a couple of different things
I'm going to do an episode about their
max IQ SSD cache feature and I'm also
going to do a cut actually here I should
give some background for that where's
that drive I've got a momentus xt here
so basically this is like a big server
grade solution of what a momentous XT is
so instead of having a single laptop
hard drive with 14 gig SSD kind of built
in you can take this raid controller
card you can hook up like three drives
in raid 5 or a raid 0 or whatever you
want and then you hook up on adaptec SSD
as a 32 gig cash for it so that's pretty
cool and then the next one over is just
a network card so that's not very
interesting but basically I'm going to
be doing a couple things these hitachi
drives are for an episode on raid how to
set it up how to install windows on a
raid configuration and then this is for
the max IQ episode and then this one the
zotac 1 i'm actually going to be using
for a geforce overclocking guide it'll
be pretty much like the radio and
overclocking guide but the key
difference is that you have to adjust
the shader clock as well as the core
 one more piece of hardware I have
that is pending an episode of tech tips
is this Kingston 4 gig kit of their blue
series RAM and I wish I had a better
angle on it so I could show you where it
says blue on the heat spreader but it
looks like I can't but that's going to
be a little episode on RAM overclocking
because Kingston's big thing with this
round is that it overclocks really well
so there you have it that's all the
stuff that's sitting on my test bench
right now and that is my weekend update
I guess
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
