and apparently the camera man's
interested in my shirt this is my new
hoodie I got it for Christmas it's a bit
of an early present vancouver canucks go
canucks okay so here we have the Vesta
6050 system that i showed kind of an
in-progress build up so i just want to
go over the overall specs again we've
got the core i7 950 that's a quad-core
hyper-threading processor with the
corsair h70 liquid cooling all in one
unit on it so it's running nice and cool
no matter what we throw at it we've got
12 gigs of ram we've also got an asus
rampage formula motherboard in here so
that's the next 58 board running dual
gtx 580 graphics card so these are the
top of the range single GPU graphics
cards on the market they are capable of
all of them videos exclusive
technologies like CUDA physics 3d vision
and as you can see on the left here we
have the crazy Russian himself who is as
part of our validation process for this
system demonstrating nvidia surround
gaming in mafia 2 which is one of the
games that takes advantage of all of
those awesome Nvidia technologies now
this is just the introduction and we're
actually going to have him showing off a
very intense scene with lots of broken
glass and guns and explosions and all
kinds of good stuff so we can really
show you what physics can do to enrich
the gameplay experience so a couple
other things I want to show you guys SSD
means we've got nice fast loading times
no matter what we're doing on this
system that's a 120 gig vertex 2 and
then we've also got a storage drive here
so i believe it's uh i can't remember
how big the storage drive is but i think
it's two terabyte hopefully uh yep two
terabyte nice i got the i got the thumbs
up over there alright then in terms of
power supply we've got a TX 850 power
supply which is more than capable of
providing all the power needed for this
system and we're able to maintain even
during a gaming scenario relatively
quiet operation now we could probably
yeah we could probably turn down those
course their fans a little bit but it's
not the
the world and that's part of what keeps
it running so cool and I mean hey that's
good right so anyway this is the
introduction so we'll come back when
when the Russian is ready for us to show
off some of the more intensive gaming
experience Russian I'm still give
Canadian about whatever that you can
have with this machine alright so now we
are going to demonstrate the best to 60
50 with all the physx zealand theory
that we can muster alright so here we go
so we're going to have water affects all
over the place destructible environments
broken glass I think whether Russian is
playing on easy right now but you know I
guess they're not very good at video
games in Russia so it's somewhat
understandable still get to actually
video game plays um whatever so here
here he is hiding behind the corner and
hopefully he starts to cause some real
havoc here pretty quick I've actually
never played this game before so that's
why I asked him to do the gameplay video
for me hey nice there we go causing
senseless having loved it so you can see
that the glass is all persistent in the
environment here and you should probably
kill that guy that shooting at you and
that's powered by Nvidia CUDA so with
their physics technology they're able to
yeah it's actually kind of neat they're
able to weld I and then fall on the
broken glass is this a blast move when
you die it's okay we'll be back at the
red dragon restaurant in just a moment
here and yeah so that was pretty much
the whole point of this this is the
latest system we've developed at NCIX it
is based on the fastest technologies
that we can throw together in a very
very nice quiet enclosure and hopefully
you guys enjoy it we do have the two
configurations available so the one is
going to run you about and I've got my
cheat sheet there about 1,800 bucks and
that one is with single 580 it has an h
50 water cooler instead of the h70
you've got 12 gigs of lower speed ram
instead of the higher speed ram and
you've also got a lower end power supply
and then if you go
performance edition that one's around
2,600 you get the faster memory you get
the bigger water cooler you get the
storage hard drive instead of no storage
hard drive they both have an SSD you
also get the upgraded power supply and
hopefully I am not missing anything
right you get the Republic of gamers
motherboard so on the base one you will
get AP 6 x 15 de motherboard and on this
one you get the rampage 3 formula so
thank you for checking out this video on
the mafia 2 gameplay footage with the
masta 6050 don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips and big thanks to our
Soviet Canadian friend over there for
doing our gameplay demo if you want to
see something really pathetic this is
camera man he actually got further into
the level been crazy Russian and they
are on the same difficulty level nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
