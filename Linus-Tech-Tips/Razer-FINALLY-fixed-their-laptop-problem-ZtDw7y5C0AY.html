by D brand their grip case is Lynas
accident proof and their prism screen
protectors protect your screen like
really really well before that though
check out this so razor is updating the
blade advanced as you might expect it is
now going to be available with an art CX
2060 that is a non max Q that is a
full-fledged r-tx 2060 or an RT X 2070
or 2080 even both of those ones with max
Q design as in video says also known as
with the clock speeds throttled a little
bit but that's not even the most
important thing they changed about this
kit and get in here get in here to check
this out okay so first of all that right
there yes my friends we've got windows
hello with the IR camera so finally Alex
can stop complaining about Razer laptops
not having that feature and come check
this out oh and you're probably like
whoa what was the big deal there I don't
really get it hold on a second where's
my where's mine here okay okay now we
look at it side by side the secondary
functions of the keys are illuminated I
have been complaining about this yes
this is a huge bummer for me actually
being that backlighting on the secondary
functions of the F keys and the number
row is no longer backlit which sucks
because these are the things that I'm
most likely to have trouble remembering
in the dark three years they traded
having all the functions illuminated for
chroma and I was like really guys really
we're killing functionality over RGB
well now we can have both and the best
thing is they didn't have to change the
key switches so these are still the same
ones that both Alex and I liked from the
original blade advanced there's a couple
of other tweaks it can now accept up to
64 gigs of RAM though Razer doesn't
currently have any plans to offer a
configurator on their site so you could
actually have it shipped with that so
they're all 16 gig configurations out of
the box they have tuned the speakers a
little bit and I think that's
much the majority of it still 144 Hertz
display but on the display front there's
some other interesting news they've got
a prototype here with a 240 Hertz
display silky-smooth it's only 1080p but
if I was an eSports player a 240 Hertz
display with an r/t X 2060 would be a
pretty nice place to be in terms of a
cost to performance and experience ratio
and this one right here is the one that
really grabbed our attention when we
walked in the room this has a prototype
OLED display and they haven't really
well they don't have anything to really
tell us about when we could expect to
see something like this or even if the
OLED manufacturers are gonna figure out
the burnin issues that have plagued them
up until this point but Wow does it ever
look good it looks exactly like you'd
expect as good as OLED but on a laptop
razer also has a monitor it's up to 144
Hertz
it's got Razer chroma RGB in the bass
free sync and ah yes right this is going
to be their claim to fame on this guy
the forged aluminum stand that still
manages to have height adjust so that's
pretty nice and built-in cable
management so these are USB so you can
plug in your peripherals and then it's
got a single type see that it uses as an
uplink and then also HDMI and yep yeah
this one's tethered to a power brick
down here $6.99 for that guy so that's
all pretty good stuff but the coolest
thing we saw was actually on the
peripheral side for a change I don't
even think we've made a video about
razors peripherals in their suite in at
least a couple of years but this is
something that once again I thought I
was going to think that it was stupid
but then it was far less stupid than I
thought I would think it would be so
this is razors vibrating headphones
which we reviewed recently and said well
actually not that stupid now now we see
maybe not the end game but certainly the
next step in the game because everything
that
I am touching right now that is to do
with my gaming experience has haptic
feedback so this wrist rest has a haptic
motor over here on the left exactly
where you'd rest your hand on WASD and
it's strong enough that you can actually
kind of feel it throughout the keyboard
but subtle enough that it's not just
like well you know old haptics or you're
holding the controller and it's like
like it's not like that the mouse has a
haptic motor in the palm and then the
chair actually has haptic feedback in
this this rear cushion here and the way
that this works is just like the
headphones where depending on the
direction that sound is coming from so
it uses surround sound data it gives you
a haptic response so as you're stepping
around you can actually feel it in the
keyboard as you use your jetpack you can
actually feel the rumble behind you and
if you fire a rocket for example and
turn around you feel it in the back and
if you fire a rocket and it's in the
front you feel it more in your keyboard
and in your mouse even though overwatch
doesn't have any specific tuning for
these peripherals it works shockingly
well now razors vision for the future is
that they would actually be able to get
this technology integrated into games
and I'm sure they'd love to see a wide
variety of different peripherals and
wearables to enhance the gaming
experience and I don't think they really
envision it as something that's for
competitive players but if you're just
looking for immersion it is shocking how
not dumb the whole thing feels even in
these very early stages so I think that
wraps it up for the razer booth as
always this year our CES 2019 coverage
is brought to you by D brand the D brand
grip case is all about helping you keep
a grip on your phone it's got this super
gripping material it's got their
trademark extra clicky buttons all over
the case and as before it is basically
Lynas proof it's D brand so you can
customize it with any look you'd like
and the whole
thing is precision fit for your device
their prism screen protectors on the
other hand these are these are something
else just like the grip it protects your
phone but the way it does it just blew
my mind the demo you're watching right
now none of that is staged that's real
that's a prism screen protector on the
front of the phone and it feels glassy
but then you go and you hit it with
stuff or you hit your phone against
stuff and somehow you can just peel the
whole thing away and it's like it never
happened obviously don't be an idiot
you know if you you know put it under a
hydraulic press your phone's gonna get
destroyed but between the grip and the
prism man do they have a foam protective
solution on their hands and you can
check it out at the link below so thanks
for watching guys
