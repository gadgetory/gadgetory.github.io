video description to learn more it's
finally here guys the fire test with the
IO safe end to fire proof waterproof
Nazz now I was going to do something
kind of ghetto with our fire test that
wouldn't really have been safe and so I
reached out to Western Digital makers of
the ever-popular WD red these are our
preferred nas drives around here
speaking of preferred which now is
drives did you buy slick for three
terabyte WD reds and did you get those
for free or sponsored in any way yeah
okay so they're expensive but we do
believe that they're worth that they are
rated for 24/7 operation they do come
with 24/7 tech support and of course
they come with a longer warranty than
most consumer grade drives so they're
rated for operation and anywhere from
single to five drive operation within a
single enclosure and even more than that
you're going to want to step up to an se
and the main point of all this is we are
going to be putting these drives inside
our n2 we have gotten a sponsorship from
WD to do this they're not giving us any
money but they're going to be giving the
local fire department like hundreds of
dollars which is actually very generous
of them considering that we're going to
light their drives on fire but then
they'll hopefully still work to have us
go down to their training grounds and
actually do a simulation of burning down
the NASS and then spraying it with water
which is exactly what this fire proof
water proof Ness is designed to
withstand so I'm going to go ahead and
I'm going to throw our 2wd red drives in
here so you got an allen key that's
included for tightening these bad boys
up and we are going to head down to the
training ground to get this done
remember the way that this works is that
it actually sweats liquid from this
protective material around here and then
ventilation is still provided to the
drives by having these heat sinks around
here taking air from the outside now the
way that the n2
works I go into this in more detail in
my unboxing of all things but the way
that it works is that it is allowing air
to pass through to cool the components
inside while not allowing fire through
by having a baffle on the front shield
right here so that there's no direct
line-of-sight for the fire and the
flames to get into the drives themselves
so we're going to close this up and I'm
actually super excited to do this I've
been looking forward to this for a while
so we wanted to give you guys a quick
look at the burn room that we'll be
using so here's the IO safe end tune as
Richard is loading in pallets that we're
going to use to feed the fire get her
goin get her up to a pretty unacceptable
temperature for a normal hard drive and
then we're going to we're going to douse
it off with the with the hydrant and
hose that you saw before so let's just
give you guys a closer look inside here
at where we're going to be putting it
inside the burn room all right so we're
loading up pallet so go ahead yep and so
you can see there's like they use this
pretty often so I'm told that the fire
kind of goes up here and curls around in
the ceiling and once Richard gets
completely geared up you were saying how
close can you get to this fire right
right here probably alright so basically
you can stand right next to it about how
hot are we expecting this to get I could
see around 800 probably so 800 to 900
degrees Celsius we've actually got a
thermal imager that we're going to be
using to verify the temperature and the
the IO safeness is being positioned
right here so this is this is going to
get pretty toasty is this pretty
realistic for what you'd expect for if
this thing was actually in a house fire
what it would be subjected to this is
probably worst-case scenario this would
be around the most flammable heat
creating objects you could possibly
imagine you know this would be
sandwiched between couches and drapes
and basically all the worst things you
could imagine excellent
so here we're doing a quick run-through
of how the thermal-imaging camera works
so check this out there's a bunch of
different modes but I'm gonna go with oh
I don't know let's just go with the most
sort of colorful interesting one you can
see slicks hand pops out whether it's in
red or whether it's in white here or
whether it's white as hot black is hot
all the different things can be hot but
let's just
go to the super colorful one because
that one looks like lots of fun so go
ahead and pull your hand away from the
door
you can see it actually still remembers
where where he touched it so if we look
inside the room we can see the pallets
right here and we can also see the i/o
safe Nazz right there
this particular yet there's their slick
standing there so this particular
cinderblock was out in the Sun and the
pallets rather than the Sun that's why
they're quite a bit hotter than the rest
of the inside of the room so we're here
with Captain Brian Yule who is
overseeing the operation here today and
just to be clear Township of Langley
Fire Department doesn't endorse the IO
safe end to nas or anything like that
but they have very generously given us a
pretty good cost on helping us out here
with testing it
according to sort of what we agree is
what we'd say is kind of a reasonable
simulation so how long is this going to
run we anticipate it will run about 20
to 25 minutes depending on the
temperature and get it to and that is
your typical well typical timeframe from
when a fire starts to people notifying
the fire department that they've got a
fire in their house and in the
temperatures that it will get to once we
once we arrive in our typical response
time which is around 8 minutes ok so wow
really yeah that's correct
wow that's outstanding ok so we're gonna
hit probably you set around eight
hundred to a thousand degrees peak yeah
we're going to target we're going to
target in the eight to nine hundred
degree range over a thousand degrees it
starts to break down the gunite on the
walls which is our fire fire coating for
the walls but we're going to shoot for
approximately nine hundred grease at the
seat of the fire okay and then this is
going to be pretty much what you'd
consider to be a pretty worst-case
scenario in terms of correct haven't
having a fire start right next to next
to the target target whatever you want
to call it is worth definitely
worst-case scenario alright so Richard
tell us about this gear what do you got
here
well we got our mask kind of
self-explanatory is it self-explanatory
sir is it well and I know there's a lot
of gamers that watch this channel the
gamer myself so this is actually a HUD
this is my head it's up display so this
displays lights so lets me know how much
air is in my pack I've got my clear
command this is a speaker there's a
speaker right in the mouthpiece it
allows everyone to hear me it's
extremely hard to communicate when
you're in a fire so that's why I use
that for and of course we have the SCB
yay which is the air bottle and the
backpack I have my radio which I'll be
on and I have our tick which is our
thermal-imaging camera which I believe
we just showed up all right so it's fire
time Richard you got what is what is
this sorry was this torch called tiger
torch all right light her up that looks
like fun that looks like lots of fun
we're ready to go we're ready to go
let's do it let's light this thing so
any goes because he's only lighting it
right now it's okay for Richard to go in
without his a full breathing apparatus
and all of that noise so what we're
going to do is we're going to light her
up get on out of there we're going to
close the door and then we're going to
check on it add maybe three or
five-minute intervals have a look at it
with the thermal-imaging camera maybe
leave it open for just just a couple
seconds here so that they can get the
fire starting yes we are legitimately
lighting this thing on fire folks so
we're going to check on it every few
minutes and see if it needs to be stoked
see if we need to do anything to help
make sure that we're reaching the
temperatures we're going for here which
as a reminder is around 800 to a
thousand degrees Fahrenheit
so before he goes in you want to tell us
how he's going to put out the fire
Richard's going to perform what's called
an indirect attacked where he's going to
shoot a modified fog which is about 30
degrees at the ceiling for two seconds
he's going to let the steam from the
water droplets rain down on the fire
it'll help darken it down then he'll
narrow his pattern a bit and then attack
the fire directly on should only take a
couple of minutes here he goes guys
you want to give the anaz a good spray
just for good measure all right so we're
surveying the damage now on the left
side of the unit here you can see the
steel enclosure didn't really discolor
too much and didn't really bow out too
much although it did bow a little bit
whereas on the right side where it was
right next to the fire even in the fire
it has discolored and if you get an
angle of it kind of from the front here
you can see it actually bowed out a fair
bit so it was it was warped and deformed
the front ports the front USB port the
SD card reader these are just empty
holes now because all the plastics
surrounding them has completely melted
away
you're not intended to reuse this Nazz
you send it to i/o safe they put new
drives in a Nunez and transfer your data
on to that and send it back to you
that's how the whole service works now
here on the back you can see the only
thing left of the cooling fan for the
unit is the four screws around the
outside other than that it's just a mass
of melted plastic and this is a little
bit surprising but the Gigabit Ethernet
port and the 2 USB 3 ports of the back
kind of survived but then the the power
input did not so once again I wouldn't
even begin to consider firing this thing
up har-har-har
after it's been fired up yeah kind of
survivors and they like still have color
but they wouldn't work just bring that
out there so here we are guys we see a
bit of a sharp contrast here between the
destroyed nas and the replacement now as
now you would normally ship this thing
back in its current state to IO safe you
would not do any of these any of this
taking apart on your own because wow
it's like you hear that sound ah okay
because you don't know what you're doing
and you don't know what you're getting
yourself into necessarily with respect
to sort of water the water seals having
water getting into them or
or whatever other problems there might
be you want to be real careful about
this and just let IO safe take care of
it for you but of course we are not that
patient so we wanted to just take this
bad boy apart and show you guys what's
up so you can actually see the material
that we had inside the n2 has got some
sort of burn marks on it here especially
around the edges but you can also see
that there's still some condensation on
the inside of the plastic sheathing
that's over top of it and right here up
against where the drives are there's no
no burn marks at all you can also see
that on the right hand side or well I
guess it would have been the but yeah
the right hand side of the unit is much
more burned than the left hand side of
the unit and that was because the fire
was right there up against it so that
was that was where it took the brunt of
the damage okay so next up we've got the
actual aluminum housing inside you can
see there's more more scorch marks okay
so the aluminum housing here serves a
couple of purposes number one is that it
keeps the hard drives cool under normal
operating conditions so that's where the
airflow sort of covers and it's got some
heat sinks on it number two is it acts
as the waterproof seal for the unit so
that keeps the water from the fire hose
out so we're going to go ahead and try
and pry it off here okay so we just
managed to pry it off with a fork I
suspect what happened is the gasket
around the outside probably melted a bit
and it looks like that may or may not
have been the case actually it's in not
that conditional things considered so
yeah it looks like just around this one
edge on that one side where the fire was
touching the Naz almost the whole time
that's the only place where we see any
kind of a problem here so let's start
with the drive that probably got it a
little bit easier in terms of the abuse
that went on
okay so it looks pretty normal you
wouldn't know that that was sitting in a
fire for 20 to 25 minutes all right now
the abused one here we go Kai's let's go
ahead and pull this out it is highly
recommended actually it is required that
you let your drives dry out completely
before reinstalling them in another
enclosure or doing anything with them
our enclosure didn't really get that wet
and I don't think that the
waterproofness was penetrated at all and
there isn't it really any moisture left
in the device to go inside here and
bother it so we're probably going to be
able to pretty much fire these babies up
and I'll let you guys know if they still
work I mean look at this this was in
this way and there's no no perceivable
damage to it at this point in time so
we're going to keep the camera rolling
and we're just going to time-lapse this
because I want you guys to know that
there's no faking and no switcheroo
going on here
if these drives have data on them they
survived a 25 minute fire
you
no way my precious my precious pictures
so there you have it guys I mean I
shouldn't be surprised I Oh save told me
it was going to work but still you saw
that fire I mean look at this enclosure
oh so heavy look at the way that this
side bowed out I mean we abused this
thing to the point where I wasn't
necessarily that you know convinced that
anything was going to survive it look
what happened to the cooling fan in the
back that mean it's gone it's
obliterated I know you can still smell
it even even now so ah the idea is not
to keep using these drives the idea is
to pull all the data off of them and use
different drives now which of course IO
safe takes care of but there you have it
guys my precious memories are still on
banaz let's see you can see if we can
play back Big Buck Bunny oh it's an MK V
ok well we'll play back lake Oh mov ok
mp4 yes open with Windows Media Player
look at that there's the old MC IX tech
tips intro playing off of two hard
drives that were sitting this far away
from a thousand degree Fahrenheit plus
fire thanks for checking out this video
huge thanks to IO safe who sent us two
of their NASA's to make this happen and
then WD who paid for us to go to the
training facility and set the whole
thing on fire other than that this is
just a Linus tech tips video so there's
there's no sponsorship beyond that so we
were as interested as anyone in finding
out whether this whole thing was going
to work and that's again that's one of
the reasons we brought in a second
sponsor to fund us lighting it on fire
because WD ultimately doesn't have
anything invested in whether or not this
NAS works but I'm sure they're happy to
know that they have something fireproof
to recommend to their customers at this
point so there you go guys like this
video if you liked it dislike it if for
whatever reason you disliked it I
thought it was awesome though leave a
comment letting
smell what you thought and as always
