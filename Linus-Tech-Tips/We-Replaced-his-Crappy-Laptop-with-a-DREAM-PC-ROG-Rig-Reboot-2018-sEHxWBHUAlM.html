it's ROG reg reboot again and the
winners are here at least one of the
winners is here this is Shaun and I
would like everyone to take a moment
both to feel good for him because he's
getting a brand new gaming rig courtesy
of ROG and he has excellent posture look
at his posture his mom actually asked
him before he showed up here to make
sure that he keeps his posture nice
because he she'd hate for other people
to see his posture and think that think
what no I don't have good posture that
would be terrible
let's build a rig shall we yeah no you
know that's like oh yeah yeah yeah I
hate it when people do this because
there's no standard way to do it
for both gaming and content creation the
a Suzy 390 a motherboard is built to
last using premium Japanese capacitors
learn more at the link below so here's a
screwdriver it's like you're not ready
yet so Sean where you're from Maple
Ridge that's where I'm from you go to
Garibaldi no that's probably just as
well I went to Garibaldi and we all kind
of see how that worked out
have you ever built a computer before no
never have you at least watched a build
video before Oh No yeah I watched the
ROG ones and then the super RGB one
which is probably why Asus liked you so
much as a candidate because those guys
are all about RGB all the things you've
got an RGB keyboard got an RGB graphics
card RGB motherboard with Aris Inc got
an RGB cooler you have an RGB Mouse an
RGB headset and the case it's probably
RGB too so then since you're a seasoned
watcher of build videos I'm sure you
know where to start
oh I'm just gonna go ahead okay if you
want to break it's totally up to you I
don't want to break it yeah cuz you know
if you break it like the whole things
over like you get back in your car you
go back home and it's over right like
it's a test okay so let's go go ahead
and get the processor out of the box now
this is the heart and soul of your
system
there's a seal element six cores have a
mentor going up to 4.9 gigahertz I still
remember when I built my first system
I'm just kidding I don't remember that
it was a long time ago you are way out
ahead of me so Shawn already pointed at
that little dot and why is that dot
important so you can line it up properly
with this arrow that's right are you
sure that you don't line it up with the
dot though I'm not sure well that's it
he's done he's packing it back up he's
gonna get out of here with bully crap
you are getting two terabytes of
solid-state storage normally they do
like a hard drive for your games and
stuff but you've got an almost terabyte
nvme drive and you get a terabyte they
Souza pulled out all the stops
for you they must really like you hear
that sniffle that's his case of the
crappy systems
I'll stop sniffling by the tens build
ends all right now I know Maple Ridge
kids fall into one of two camps the ones
that play with knives and the ones that
play with fire so which one are you I
don't know what's the right response
only in the wrong hands yeah is that
because your dad's sitting there and you
won't admit it
No so which sticks go in which slots the
you're filling them all with the match
said yeah yeah okay and then you want to
push it down evenly until it clicks in
on both sides so that's how you know you
got to give a little right there oh
there you go
one more okay this is a tougher one
it'll be the nvme SSD oh very nice this
is a brand new I fix it kid Wow we have
to do just one side or both I don't know
what I usually do is I start with one
and then I see what happens any please
put this having flashbacks to being a
teenager this was my job whenever my dad
did something hold the screws in the
nails symptoms of crappy system itis
include shaking hands not being able to
open boxes yeah and the sniffles this
way sure why not I don't know how to put
it in well it's okay you're pretty young
you'll learn later you want to give it a
little okay push snug into the socket
I'll let you do it though okay um cooler
for the CPU you know what sure yeah
let's do it let's let's do that that
side of the cooler and that crazy when
you walked in here you had like an old
laptop with onboard graphics I have an
Intel T 6400 four gigs of ram ddr2 and
that's still what you have because you
haven't actually completed the challenge
yet tf2 is running it like 15 to like 30
frames per second and all those settings
look at the size of these nuts they're
bigger so it's gonna be easier to like
yeah yeah I mean they're easier to
handle
which I guess is nice
so this is the one that has an oled
screen built into the CPU block and I'm
gonna do the peel because I can't trust
you
to do it properly that was worth it
shiny this is your mom's sphaghetti dude
arms are heavy these builds are too much
fun I love this I thought he was like
putting on sort of a character like
making it a bit more extra for the
camera but he's like always active and
that much like think excited about
everything so what do you think goes on
next thermal paste actually yes but no
asu's pre-applied your thermal paste
Thank You Asus so the screen in the
middle here you can actually put
anything you want on it you could put
like an ROG logo if you were all about
that you know thanks ROG for this
totally free computer or I mean you
could just put like a dick butt on it
like whatever I guess well I like
working with cables and stuff we could
like no you really want to put that SSD
in don't you I guess we're gonna do this
then are you sure
oh we're gonna put it in the case yes
yeah this is the part where it gets
really fun tempered glass that's nice be
careful when it gets matte just boom
shatters oh that's not good all right so
this is gonna fall off very soon so you
should probably yep that's good there
you go two hands please very nice okay
so talk that away somewhere safe we
don't want to scratch that because that
is your viewport into your gorgeous
system that is a perfect place for it
he's putting it in a bin he's not just
chucking it on the floor it is heavy
don't have crush my fingers then won't
be able to use my mouse
ten points if you can figure out how to
open this before I do I won't I lied on
you how now this is something that's
always kind of triggered me about these
you went to all the effort to print on
the bag and you couldn't just say what
it's for goes in here sure does
other way other way Oh like that
no nice wait wait go in I just have it
lined up if they're like really force it
in yeah pretty much
use the force like yeah no no the real
force yeah no that's that's movies yes
Oh what we can do that yeah let's go
nice for a stick here but I guess that's
cooler and he's still putting the I oh
shit I'm having a lot of trouble so you
hold it by the cooler and use your other
hand to guide it in and you're gonna try
to guide the rear i/o through the back
before you make contact with all of the
metal standoffs that are on the
motherboard tray you ready
I hope correct answer is yes I was born
ready
and you gotta have like kind of a gruff
tone to your voice before
ready born ready that's too deep yeah
it's done and the screws you're gonna
use are the 632 flat flat is the heads
of the people who labeled these flat
because these are clearly a panhead and
they clearly use a Phillips type driver
so there's nothing really flat about
them so what do you think is next
perfect
alright so we're gonna put your modular
cables onto the power supply first do
first 60
that's not good as a drop expert I can
tell you that drop was fairly benign yes
yes sweet do we need all of them am I
just doing this for no reason no you're
actually almost done you only need one
more cable you know what's really good
about a video like this is that you are
giving other people the confidence to
ask stupid questions and make mistakes
but that means I'm doing worse than them
right you're late welcome the
sacrificial lamb no one died thanks got
this cool computer does this plug into
the motherboard or is this one going to
the basically the rule from here on out
with these is if it fits it since we'd
have to spend like eight years don't
worry your street cred was it was too
low kinda down here already anyways
since it's fine there's an alignment
thing right there maybe these this goes
into the motherboard it kind of doesn't
work without any of the pieces well you
don't really need families well maybe
your old system did it but with a twenty
atti and a 700 K you're gonna need fans
and the reason this part is tricky is
because you kind of have to align a
that's a technique that I've perfected
over the years did you notice I kicked
it a little bit before it hit the ground
you can arrest some of its momentum
before it actually falls and there we
are all of our cooling is completely
wired up now what do you want to install
alright so let's do it
okay no
you can tell he's almost cured he hasn't
sniffled in forever oh that doesn't have
to come all the way out that is called a
self retaining screw so you see how it
has like because of a knob on the end
and then a shaft in the middle yeah um
they don't really need a screwdriver for
this no it was too paid for me oh not
strong no that's not it's not big rock
it a little bit on the bottom further
there you go so these guys separate out
your cables nicely so they look all
clean and professional okay yes go ahead
enjoy it breathe it in I don't know why
I was so excited to open this there we
go
that hurts whoa check Shawn's not
something kids just say no trick shots
whoa trick shots think no what's that
except me no one literally no one the
moments you've been waiting for the
fastest graphics covered I was having no
look if you're not gonna do it right if
you're not gonna take this seriously
like we can just leave the graphic right
you know what there that's it that's a
computer forget it it has integrated
graphics just like your current one yeah
there it is
the r-tx 28 et I definitely wasn't
expecting that I thought I'd get like a
1080i but the 2880 is really cool now
with like however many bazillion
heatpipes three fans are a saint
compatibility a dual BIOS switch so you
can switch between quiet and performance
mode and it's super duper duper duper
fast open it let's do it hmm let's put
it in
yeah really heavy see I knew it wasn't
there you and that was it
your artsy x20 atti is installed
well after you put the screws in and put
the power connecting yeah so now we just
need to find the prettiest spot to bring
these guys around which honestly we
don't have a ton of great options here
so now that I've given up we're just
gonna do whatever okay then before
anyone gets a chance to look too closely
at it I'm gonna close up the back panel
and it is beautifully cable managed as
far as you know me Dad
it's not an eight pin CPU connector
why's that got two of those in there you
go in there I'm gonna close this up for
the last time almost done that looks
really cool oh nice really good yeah
that is sick like a giant dick but it
takes up the whole rest of it that is
awesome Alex yeah so the monitor we're
hooking this up to is basically one of
the finest gaming displays on the market
now this guy is 2560 by 1440 resolution
up to 165 Hertz pretty much what that
means is that your monitor can keep up
with your system a lot more than 60 I
knew you were here for a reason and it
was that contribution that one line this
entire experience was leading up to that
moment all right go ahead and press the
button
whoa okay dang we got it wrong that's
fine I'm pretty sure we can flip it this
is gonna look C yak as the kids say what
total memory 32 Meg's sorry I was
thinking back to my first computer um
press f12 run set up okay I mean sounds
good you don't have a choice so we've
got pretty much everything while this
has touch controls no no no that's
pretty cool
where's Mike ah attractable make that's
what that was
yeah does the worm it's the worm still
cool it's in effect it's in fortnight
here you go oh I don't play for it Nate
really no one plays it in my school
anymore you kids today you like hearing
it one day and boom gone the neck you
know what forget it let's just finish
this thing up so let's go ahead and put
our tempered glass side panel back on
complete with laser etched LTT logo okay
got you do the pillow you didn't feel
well I got places to be festive
oh we still got stuff on the some other
boys and stuff with any sweet peels
don't blow it
oh okay yeah you know what probably the
least exciting part was screwing
everything in here we go you want to
screw me in here oh yeah that's a really
long time
oh but the rest was really interesting
really fun you see a scope they're not
really all right
the sound-dampening in this is like
really really good I put it on and like
I could barely hear your talking you're
just gonna put those there you're not
gonna have sound well I'm not gonna play
like a full game all right so have you
ever nope
bonk Wow you just got shrekt man oh is
this like team deathmatch yeah why'd you
pull out your knife there I almost
didn't see him so is gonna run faster
you know what I um okay there's okay
well that's that's for you oh yeah a
sponge it oh he was just looking I
wouldn't have given you this computer if
I'd known you were gonna do that that is
what you get that's the same guy you
100% deserved it anything 250 FPS what
is what is that an increase above like
20x yeah more over your old machine all
right well now why don't we go for
something that's a little bit more
demanding so I'm gonna show you how you
dial in the optimized settings for a
machine like this you go to graphics and
you go to highest that's basically it
also you should turn motion blur off
because it's for chumps yeah I think
they're crashing they seem to be
distressed about it so it's probably not
like a planned crash no that's
definitely not oh that's whoa whoops I
don't think the seatbelts gonna help you
hunt
what oh boy she's okay she's gonna pry
the rock off the leg and not leg that
looks very painful all right you're sort
of playing you get to foam the rock so
there you go hold wlw Oh
oh yeah well this games really hard ah
yes this is gonna be fun so results for
3dmark times by extreme better than 83%
of all results way above like even the
guys running you know 4k gaming pcs or
whatever else the case may be you're
like way out here so basically of all
the giant nerds that like benchmark
their systems for fun you're in the top
20% so that's pretty much it thank you
ROG
and - me too goo for having me out here
are you feeling better shot yeah yeah no
more coughing no more sniffing excellent
actually he's cured he's cured so guys
