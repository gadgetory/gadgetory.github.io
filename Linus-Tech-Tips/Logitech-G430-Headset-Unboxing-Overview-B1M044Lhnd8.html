for more details film makers need to get
over this 24 FPS like diva oh it looks
more cinematic thing because you know
what if you ever watched a movie and
gone oh there's a pan of mountains at
least I think it was a pan of mountains
because it might have been a slideshow
from like my great-aunts trip to the
Alps or something because it's
ridiculous anyway I digress
this is my unboxing of the g4 30 from
Logitech which is pretty similar to the
g2 30 now we've addressed an issue with
outdoor unboxings that people have been
complaining about for a while and that
is that there's nowhere to put the
product we have dragged the table
outdoors and that is the solution that
we've come up with so this headset is
part of Logitech's massive refresh of
their gaming series products including
the g 100's the g 400s the G 500s the G
700s the g5 10s the G what's the
keyboard the G 19's the g2 30 and the g4
30 so unlike the g2 30 the g4 30 has a
blue theme which is kind of shaking
things up a little bit because generally
speaking like the the like the
stereotype is that the high performance
Extreme Edition one is going to be red
whereas like the lower-end one will be
blue but in this case the g4 30 is
actually the more premium headset
because it does come with a USB
soundcard
integrated with it giving it 7.1
surround in software capabilities so
they're using Dolby technology which by
and large is well it's definitely one of
the better solutions out there but in
terms of the actual headphones
themselves there hasn't been much that's
changed so it's got the same wide
headband but narrow looking pad that I
found because it's so soft and squishy
see it has here I'm going to press on
this and you guys are going to see it
has a very slow recoil see that that's
really important because what that does
is it makes it feel kind of funny the
first time you ever put the headset on
but once it mushes out a little bit
pushes out and it puts much more even
pressure on your head I mean Logitech's
good at organics if nothing else they've
been doing it a long time the ear cups
on the other hand do use a harder foam
but it's quite deep so what you're going
to discover with headsets like this is
that they might not be instantly the
most comfortable thing you've ever heard
but they will definitely improve over
time as they mold to your head and these
aren't the kinds of things that I would
lend to someone else because you don't
want someone else's head shape
you know gunking up your your head
groove that's going on here so the mic
is a boom mic I'm just going to actually
here will show you the fitting first
metal pieces love metal pieces here they
just they inspire confidence they make
me feel good about the build quality of
the headphones that I just bought when
you have plastic size adjustments it
just it feels it feels cheaper it just
really does and metal bands really don't
add that much weight so it goes all the
way up to about here and then all the
way down to basically kid size which
will sit pretty high up on my head just
like that so I'm going to pull those
down again alright so the boom mic goes
up here boom mic goes down here and
let's head into the cable so it's got a
nice blue braided cable very thin which
I personally actually kind of like
because it means it's less likely to -
but King can get caught on stuff and oh
yeah they've used a really high quality
cable you can see even though it's been
packaged up there's almost no kinkiness
to it my Logitech g9 by contrast I've
had for years and still has the original
kink from when it was bound up in the
box so that's that's a really nice
improvement and did I say that this was
USB holy crap Logitech is doing it the
right way here awesome this is the way
to do it manufactures for those of you
who are wondering instead of integrating
the USB connector directly into the
headphones just include this adapter
there's your USB sound card now you have
the option to use it as a USB sound card
or hook it up to an even higher quality
audio source so these USB sound cards
are better than onboard sound they do
provide that virtual surround
functionality remember guys you don't
need multiple
speakers in your headphones in order to
get a surround experience you have two
ears and when the speaker is sitting
right next to it you only need two
speakers for surround you'll find the
virtual haircut virtual barbershop or
whatever on YouTube and you'll see what
I mean but this is the way to do it
because then if you decide no I want to
use a higher quality audio source such
as a dedicated sound card bloop you plug
those into that and you are ready to go
so there you go
way to go Logitech doing things the
right way the inline controls very
simple you've got a volume wheel on the
side here there you go as well as a
microphone mute button I would have
rather seen Logitech implement a
microphone mute there's a little clip on
the back by raising the boom pull
Sennheiser did this on their PC 360 3ds
as well as their 350 SES it's a very
elegant way to deal with it so there
that there's a tip that I wish everyone
would get from from what Sennheiser's
done over there the microphone because
it's a boom mic and not a retractable
mic isn't that adjustable in terms of
positioning but it is noise cancelling
and you can kind of go up and down like
this and it does have some bendiness to
it as well so you guys can see hopefully
from that angle that it can I find the
easiest way it's like Oh put it right in
my mouth and then it'll kind of end up
in about the right place you want to at
the corner of your mouth for optimal
listening for the other people so I'm
going to see if I haven't even looked at
what they have to say about themselves
on the box so performance sport cloth
ear cups are removable for cleaning oh
that's actually really nice because some
people do get sweaty when they game I'm
not judging three-year warranty
USB adapter Windows 8 Windows 7 or
Windows Vista to use the USB sound 7.1
surround sound 40 millimeter drivers
this is something that probably would
have been good to mention and I think
that is pretty much it
lake lay flat ear cups okay this is
something so there you go lays flat this
might not be important for some people
but if you fold your headphones up and
you put them in a bag this isn't quite
as elegant as a folding design but at
least it allows you to slip it into a
side pocket without worrying about it
getting messed up my parrot zieks I sat
on them on a plane and the Fed yeah the
ear cup that wasn't supposed to go like
that went like that the other way and it
was a really really bad experience so
being able to fold
like that's really nice just want to
give you guys sort of a nice look at
what they look like so they do have the
blue accent here as well as the blue
cloth unlike the two 30s which don't
come with the USB adapter but that's
pretty much the only other difference
and they're red and then let's see if we
can figure out how to pull off that that
removable ear cut piece here that's
simple okay so there you go you take
that off wash that make sure you dry it
before you put it back on your head and
there you can see the four centimeter
speaker grille behind where the where
this sits your sides are clearly labeled
but remember guys the boom mic is always
on the left and I think that pretty much
wraps it up thank you for checking out
