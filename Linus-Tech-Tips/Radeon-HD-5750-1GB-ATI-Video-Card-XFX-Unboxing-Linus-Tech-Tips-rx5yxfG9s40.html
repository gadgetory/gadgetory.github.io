be unboxing the XFX Radeon HD 5750 now I
grabbed this at the same time as the
5750 which I have on the table next to
me and you can see there's a quick size
comparison here but we're going to show
with the 5750 later so don't focus too
much on that there cameraman let's get
this box open you can see it arrived in
a little bit better shape than our 5750
box with no obvious dents so we won't be
putting the packaging to the test today
from the front it does not come with any
games which the other ones do both of
the 5800 series XFX cards come with what
does I game dirt - and then the 5770
comes with BattleForge which actually
has a DirectX 11 patch available now so
let's start getting this package open
it's a black box just like the other
5000 series cards we've got a quick
installation guide right on the top so
that shows you the physical installation
of the card including plugging in the
power connector so this card does still
require a 6 pin PCI Express connector
here's your instructions to install the
catalyst drivers which you should not be
following because you should be
downloading the latest drivers from the
ATI website don't use this disk it is
drivers don't use it download ok so then
we have the XFX door hanger thing so
that you can not be disturbed while you
are gaming and then we have the
accessories wow that is an empty
accessory package you have a power
adapter that was it so if you wanted to
use this card with a VGA monitor you
will need to have your own adapter you
can't adapt the DVI one with the
accessories in the box now that is a
tiny card Wow
this cooler actually kind of reminds me
of the one that was on the 47 70 so
let's pull this out here and let's have
a quick look ok the first thing I really
like about this card is you've got a
huge fan on it so this is actually a
dual slot cooler and you can see here
this is this part is just shroud but
you've got a big flower type heatsink
here and what that means is that this
does not have to spend very fast because
this is not a very powerful card in the
sense that it doesn't consume a lot of
power so that means you're not going to
have a lot of excess heat and this thing
should
run really cool so first thing let's do
the back connectors you got the standard
stuff for the 5800 series two DVI one
HDMI and one DisplayPort you've got your
standard crossfire connectors on the top
then you've got at the back a six pin
power connector then you can see that
this is a standard PCI Express 16 X card
so there is your connector along the
bottom on the back of the card itself
you can see that it doesn't have a
shroud like the very high-end ones but
it does have a protective back play so
that's going to hold on that cooler in
the event that it should come off when
you're shipping a system or something
like that you can see all the RAM chips
on the back and one thing I really
wanted to do was a quick size comparison
with the whole 5800 series family so
it's actually really easy to see which
one the high-end ones are versus the
ones that are the lower end cards so at
the very top here if I can get the
camera man to kind of come over top and
pan all the way down I'm going to point
out which ones are which so this is the
5870 this is the highest end 5800 series
card at the time of filming this is the
58 50 these two cards are based on
basically the same platform so there's a
little bit of difference in clock speed
but these are the 58 hundreds now then
we step down we've got the 57 70 this is
more like a performance mid-range card
that is a boat on par maybe a little bit
slower than the GTX 260 and then there
is a slightly step-down version of the
57 70 and that's the 57 50 which we're
looking at today thank you for checking
out my video blog on the Radeon 50 750</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
