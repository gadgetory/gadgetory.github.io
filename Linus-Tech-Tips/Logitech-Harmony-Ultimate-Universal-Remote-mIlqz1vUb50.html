found the packaging even for the Harmony
ultimate which is basically Harmony
ultimate one and a harmony hub in a
single package a little intimidating
with all the space-age looking pieces
and wires staring me down when I first
opened it up my wife actually disagreed
but I guess with the kinds of packages
she encounters on a daily basis it takes
more than some 7-inch battery-powered
gizmo to get her riled up with the
purchase of a qualifying Intel processor
SSD or nook you could instantly win an
Intel gaming Jersey and be entered in
the draw for the ultimate system click
now to learn more ok so now that we've
all recovered from my terrible opening
joke the first step to getting this baby
going is to create an account for my
harmony comm and download the app for
your PC which lets you import settings
from your hypothetical previous harmony
remote I detects compatible devices on
the network like so knows audio gear and
nest thermostats then helps you manually
add your other devices by part number by
the way I'd recommend searching the
database for your gear before investing
in a remote to avoid some unpleasant
surprises at this stage then once your
devices are added it guides you through
setting up activities so you choose what
you want to do let's say watch PC for
example then you pick out all the
devices and inputs that are associated
with that activity and in theory when
you trigger the activity on the remote
all the appropriate stuff should turn on
and everything else should be off
alright so obviously this isn't going to
do anything here so let's go on a field
trip to see how it all works in the real
world alright so here we are at my house
my devices are Samsung 52 inch not smart
so I guess a dumb TV a Windows Media
Center PC with the Microsoft dongle for
IR I've also got an uncle receiver a Wii
and a ps4 as well as a chromecast
plugged into the back of the receiver so
I added the chromecast in the ps4 just
to make this video a little bit more
interesting so front and center right
here is the harmony hub it's an IR
blaster
RF receiver it's a Wi-Fi client I'm
pretty sure it's got bluetooth - the
objective is for it to be able to pick
up an RF signal from the remote and
blast the other ones mostly IR -
everything that the remote wants to
control now our signals will bounce
around and often hit whatever they need
to but if you have a door in front of
your device or for whatever reason it
can't hit it you can use one of the two
included mini IR blasters in order to
amplify the signal or reposition it I
found that the hub couldn't hit my
receiver normally but actually
positioning a mini blaster here and here
took care of it so everything is able to
be hit so let's change gears for a
second and have a look at the remote
it's it's in a handy little charging
dock and has your standard media control
buttons on top navigation buttons on the
bottom and then some programmable
buttons on the very bottom the middle is
dominated by a touchscreen that turns on
when you pick up the device with an
accelerometer you can use that to to do
week many of the settings that otherwise
you'd use the my harmony application to
change and then sync to the remote it's
a process it takes about 20 to 30
seconds from here you can turn off the
annoying lockscreen
and even more importantly use it to
launch your activities and execute
context appropriate commands that are a
bit more complicated than play or volume
up all right so enough with the
 let's click watch pc it turns
on the TV changes the input powers up
the receiver and finally wakes the
computer from sleep then if i press exit
once it's actually done completely
waking up hmm it shuts the whole thing
back down now for devices like the
PlayStation 4 and chromecast they'll
still rely on their own remotes so a
controller or our phone to wake up but I
still find configuring them with the
Harmony ultimate extremely useful
because it lets you make much better use
of the available inputs on your setup
now so let's go ahead and turn it off my
receiver only has two HDMI inputs but
with one button I can mix and match TV
HDMI inputs and receiver audio inputs
now in a way that would normally be
pretty cumbersome to navigate and
involve changing inputs here then
changing inputs here making sure the
volumes are leveled and all that kind of
stuff so I'm using the PlayStation 4
that way with an HDMI input on the TV
and then an optical audio in set to I
think CD or something like that because
he still has CDs on the receiver sure
someone does and I'm very sorry
ok so looks awesome right well hold on
don't throw your money at the screen yet
it took a lot of tinkering to get it
this way first of all and I must be an
idiot right when I wanted to add my PC I
clicked at a PC instead of entering the
part number of my IR receiver or
manually searching for Microsoft media
center se or something like that
it took 30 minutes with tech support to
figure out why my PC wasn't getting any
commands but at least there's good news
and that's that if you do the media
center se trick you can bind your
programmable buttons to commands like
alt f4 or other shortcut keys so that I
can use this handy little sound
switching app that I have to switch
between my speakers and my wireless
headphones so that's kind of cool so
then I set out to get the Wii working
and I ran into challenge number two the
default timing for TV input switching
would cause it to fail so here I'm going
to go ahead I'm going to switch to the
Wii right now would cause it to fail to
switch if I powered the whole thing off
while I was on a different input and
fired up a different activity and then
switch to the week so I had to increase
the power delay time from eight point
five to twelve seconds to make this work
every time not a huge deal just not
amazingly user-friendly challenge number
three was getting it to work with the
Wii as advertised beyond just setting
the right inputs at all I looked at
every guide I can find and I still can't
figure out how to connect to it via
bluetooth so the harmony hub can
actually power it on instead of me
having to do it manually but truthfully
I'm not even sure if I want to because
I'll always need a Wii mote to use the
thing anyway and apparently some games
require the remote to be unbound in
order to work anyway so you're going to
be constantly switching that which ties
into my last challenge just because
something
is supported doesn't mean it's not a bit
janky I don't have a nest or Phillips
hue lighting system so I can't comment
on those but the Sonos control is
nothing special it automatically stops
playing if I start another activity
normally this would be desirable because
you wouldn't play ps4 and PC games on
the same TV at the same time unless you
wanted the universe to implode but the
Sonos is different I could actually want
to play games and have ambient music and
aside from that it can't even browse my
music services or anything it just
Dunley provides basic playback controls
for whatever I last set up on my PC or
phone bit but speaking of phones that
leads into some positive stuff my
Harmony comms cloud syncing means that
enabling your harmonies functionality on
other devices such as an iPhone or
Android phone is actually super simple
just fire up the app so I'm going to
actually do this live we're gonna do
live demo will be crap it's amazing so
you fire up the app and as long as
you've set it up so your devices all
take input from the hub rather than
directly from the IR blaster on the
remote IR blaster positioning is key
here you can actually use gestures to
hear I'm just going to I'll power watch
PC off because that's the main thing I
actually do instead of you can use
gestures or buttons to do all of this
stuff on your phone instead so I guess
at this point then its conclusion time
question number one is it awesome the
answer yes it is I can just sit down and
relax instead of hunting for remotes and
I'll never have to hear why did you
spend all this money I can't even use it
because it never works but question
number two could I throw away all of my
other remotes the answer is no for this
config I would still need my Sudoku air
mouse and keyboard my Wii mote and my
ps4 controller and finally question
number three the big one is this worth
over $300 hmmm I've spent enough time
juggling remotes in my life that I'm
pretty good at it and there's no way I
would spend that kind of money on this
for myself but that doesn't mean that it
won't be worth it for some people this
product
despite its difficult setup has an
amazing ease of use once it's already
can
figured that is just made for tech dad
or tech son to buy for their family and
then set it up for them and not get
phoned or woken up in the middle of the
night anymore because someone can't
watch their favorite show oh yeah it
does tv2 but I wasn't going to subscribe
to cable just to demo that so and even
though this tech dad couldn't get it
working without help I do have to give
props to their support which is open on
Saturday in Canada they actually got me
sorted out reasonably quickly so that's
pretty much it it wins the I wouldn't
buy one but I know a dozen people it
would be perfect for a ward speaking of
things I unfortunately can't buy because
