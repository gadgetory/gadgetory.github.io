video you might have thought video
production gear under $50 and it's
actually useful well it doesn't all have
to be expensive stay right where you are
and I'll show you three items I use
nearly every single day that are
invaluable to me and also under $50
the Scimitar RGB from corsair features
17 programmable buttons at 12,000 DPI
optical sensor and a shape design for
comfort in MMO and mobile gaming learn
more at the link in the video
description getting straight to the
point this first item is something that
I cannot do a shoot without and I even
have three of them on my car door at all
times bongo ties bongo ties are very
strong black rubber bands tied around
some bamboo used as the anchor point now
everyone in the office makes fun of me
for my love of these little ties and you
might be thinking how are they even
different from regular black rubber
bands well they're far more versatile
than your average rubber band thanks to
the Anchor Point you can wrap them
around an object multiple times to get a
really tight and secure fit Bongo ties
have gotten me out of many annoying
situations where I needed to mount a
small object this is something that
doesn't really have a surface to mount
that object easily just the other day we
couldn't find our shock mount for the
boom Pole and I only had about a minute
worth of time to find a solution so I
fashioned our mic to the boom bowl with
a plastic mic mount made for a bigger
mic and two bongo ties easy these ties
are great for attaching the very long
cables where a Velcro tie is too small
or not very effective like on our
hundred-foot extension cables basically
you are limited by your imagination when
it comes to these little ties so I
challenge you if you do pick them up
tweet me your uses for them because I'm
sure there are many that I have not
thought of item number two is our trusty
SD card case from Pelican if you're at
all like me when it comes to SD card
organization it may not be your strong
suit but with this little guy you'll
always have a safe place to store and
transport the media you worked so hard
for it can take up to 12 full-size SD
cards as well as six micro SD cards and
six mini SD cards all in a solid drop
resistant package that will keep your
precious media safe and sound item
number three and possibly my favorite on
this list is the Helios 44 dash 2 now
before you jump and say Brandon how can
a lens be on this list all lenses are
expensive while this little guy will
prove you wrong for a mere 35 to 50
dollars depending on your country you
can get one of these guys on eBay and
all you have to do then is find an
adapter to your camera's mount now what
makes this lens interesting to me is
it's ridiculous swirly bouquet these
lenses were made in Russia till about
2001
to this day is one of the most
mass-produced lenses of all time which
makes them rather easy to find now this
lens isn't the sharpest or the easiest
to use depending on the condition of
your copy but is yet another creative
tool I love to play around with when
shooting b-roll and doing photography
the Logitech G 633 headset features 7.1
Dolby surround sound thanks to Logitech
Gaming software the headphones support
40 millimeter Pro G audio drivers
accented on the outside by fully
adjustable RGB lighting with custom tags
as well as a well-hidden cardioid boom
mic you can pick these up on amazon now
