sponsoring this video at CES 2017
freshbooks is the number-one cloud-based
accounting solution for small businesses
now if there is one company that's not
afraid to make a product that there
could possibly be a dozen people in the
world who would be willing to buy it
it is Steiger dynamics they build their
company this is the lead this was their
first product they built their company
on the idea that they could take
something that no one else was even
bothering to try and do and do it way
better than anyone else was doing so the
leap was the ultimate silent high
performance media center gaming PC and
in some ways they were very much ahead
of their time since then since I first
saw them like four years ago they've
launched the Maven which is a smaller
less windowed less front displayed
version and they've launched the ARA the
slimmer non sli compatible but in my
mind very sensible one and they've all
recently been updated to not only work
with the nerdy tech couch master which
they carry here in North America but
also with VR thanks to front HDMI input
that's handled with a pass-through from
the video card at the back but of course
that's not what I was holding in the
thumbnail what I'm holding is one of the
most out-there systems that I have yet
seen now is it based on an I star us a
chassis we've actually worked with those
guys before on some of the stuff in our
server room the answer is yes but they
have customized the front bezel so it's
got a beautiful brushed aluminum finish
they've got a slot load optical drive
and five tool lists hot swappable three
and a half inch drive bays on the front
of what would be for me the first rack
mountable media center gaming PC that I
have ever encountered now because these
guys are a boutique builder you'll be
able to configure the system with
anything from on
word graphics and a low-end processor
all the way up to a core i7 ten core
extreme edition with GTX 1080s in sli at
least that's as high up as they
validated for the box now do you get the
same immaculate build quality that you
do with their machines that are designed
to sit at the front of the living room
as the centerpiece of your home theater
system no you don't but this type of a
system is designed to meet a very very
specific need the enthusiast home
theater / gamer person that has so much
extra income that at the back of their
dedicated home theater room they have a
rack mount setup with all their AV gear
and now potentially a high-end gaming
machine so there you have it guys you
saw it here first rackmount gaming
machine actually you saw it here first a
year ago when I built mine but whatever
they've caught up now the industry has
has caught up to me Steiger dynamics
with B infinitum rackmount gaming
machine so thanks guys for watching and
