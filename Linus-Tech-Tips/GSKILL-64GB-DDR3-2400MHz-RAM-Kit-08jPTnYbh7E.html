DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts so the last time
I covered anything from g.skill was back
in December 2012 when they sent their
Ripjaws e quad channel kid over to me
for some ramdisk testing at the time I
did a very casual unboxing in a chair in
my living room with my son and my cat in
my lap accompanying me and I didn't
really make much of a fuss about the
product because to me I was just like a
dream this time I feel like I owe them a
bit more fanfare because that 32 gig kit
or those 32 gig kits they sent two of
them of 1866 Ram has been some of the
most rock-solid memory either slick or I
have ever encountered compared to other
high capacity kits that we have around
the office it is a dream to work with
and we use it on every test bench
mainstream Intel enthusiast Intel and
even AMD the problem is that the stuff
we have is from back when 1866 Ram was
the bee's knees it's a year and a half
old skew and with the way high-speed
memory prices have changed since then
ddr3 2133 and 24 hundred megahertz kits
are much more accessible and we're
starting to get a lot of requests from
viewers to use higher speed memory in
our testing it's just that we hate using
all the other stuff so I reached out to
g.skill about getting eight six of their
ddr3 24 hundred megahertz Ram
I chose their 64 gig kit because the way
that sticks get jumbled around between
test benches it's the only way that
we'll really know that each of them is
hand validated to operate correctly with
each other across all the benches and as
an extra bonus we happen to have an X 79
deluxe a Seuss board which is one of the
only boards that this kit is validated
to work in with all eight dims at the
same time running at 2400 megahertz so
that'll be fun if we ever want to play
around with it anyway with that history
lesson out of the way let's get into the
product itself this is one of the most
luxuriously packaged kits I have
ever seen the outer box has gold
lettering and the individual serial
numbers of every single stick inside and
when you open it up you get two
individual boxes each of which you open
up to find a little clip on memory fan
that uses 250 millimeter fans to keep
your RAM cool in the past I used to say
that these Ram coolers were kind of
stupid and I still don't care for the
added bulk of them in our test system
here they made it impossible to install
a graphics card in the top slot but I've
seen them make a difference to RAM
stability so if you're gonna push these
sticks to 2400 megahertz or even over
volt them past the rated 1.65 volts I
would recommend installing them one bit
of constructive criticism for g.skill as
I'd like to see them terminated in three
pin connectors so I can easily hook them
up to a fan controller anyway after that
each stick is individually wrapped in a
protective foam wrapping and if you've
ever seen a rip Drowsy module then once
we get out of the foam they'll look
pretty familiar to you we use them all
the time so the sawteeth styled top of
the heatsink doesn't stand out to me
much anymore and I think there are more
eye-catching memory kits out there like
with you know LED lighting and stuff but
for these it was more about the
practicality of them than necessarily
the pure looks the RAM supports two
different twenty four hundred megahertz
XMP profiles or you can set things up
manually I'm planning on using them in a
gigabyte x79 up4 motherboard for my
upcoming mac pro killer hackintosh
guides so I went ahead and installed the
kits in there and while I wasn't able to
run 24 hundred megahertz with all eight
modules in which the skill told me I
wasn't going to be able to do 21 33
megahertz was easy so even just in any
random board these are definitely an
improvement over our old sticks and I
did run around and throw them in a
couple different boards around the
office and I'm getting that same easy no
tweaks required for basic stability
operation that I have come to expect
which is a huge relief so now we can
bring you guys higher memory speeds in
our benchmarks I told g.skill that we
don't really do memory showcases anymore
and that I was only gonna use the memory
and our hackintosh guide as well as on
our test benches so they'll probably be
a bit surprised to see this but you
how little I talk about the gear that we
use behind the scenes here I thought
that this was an opportunity to not only
showcase this particular RAM kit but
also give you some insight into our
testing procedures and our experience
with all the different products that we
get to touch as well I hope you guys
enjoyed it
so I think that's pretty much it guys
like this video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment if
you have anything to say to me or the
rest of the team about this video if you
thought it was fantastic or you thought
it was just terrible I guess you could

and support us we have a support us link
in the video description you can give us
a monthly contribution you can buy
t-shirt we have some cool t-shirts now
and you can even just change your amazon
bookmark to one with our affiliate code
so we get a little kickback every time
you buy stuff and I think that pretty
much wraps it up guys thank you for
watching and as always don't forget to
subscribe for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos oh and for those
of you who have been complaining that
you missed the unboxings we kind of
worked it into the b-roll here do you
think that's a good solution bad
solution let us know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
