wrecked we compared it to a custom core
i 9p see determining that the consumer
hardware was a better value
well those skylake w chips are not
exclusive to the iMac pro so what if you
were to put one of them in a PC what is
a Zeon W and how does Intel justify the
hefty premium that you would pay over a
desktop core i-9 we're not sure what we
do know though is Origin PC sponsored
today's video origin offers beautiful
custom desktops laptops and life time
24/7 technical support they use only
high quality products like samsung's 960
pro m2 SSDs and you can visit origin PC
through the link below for a limited
time offer
so I've got two benches here for us
today both of them are running very
similar Asus workstation boards like I
wouldn't call these guys brother and
sister but if they were cousins they
probably wouldn't want to get married so
there's the X 299 sage that's running
the X 299 chipset that you're probably
already familiar with and the other one
is running a chipset that Intel calls C
422 and you will need a C 422 board if
you want to run a Xeon w so with this
chipset the main thing that you gain is
support for V pro whose claim to fame
among other things is remote management
with the convenience and vulnerability
that comes along with that what you lose
is support for Intel's opting storage
acceleration otherwise they are pretty
similar in their capabilities another
feature of Xeon w is official support
for up to 512 gigabytes of system memory
though it should be noted that some X
299 motherboards are compatible with
registered DIMMs meaning that they can
also run 512 gigs of ram with a regular
core I 9 so then if it wasn't for Intel
making ECC AZ on exclusive feature there
wouldn't really appear to be any
difference between them whatsoever
now ECC memory which we've actually
covered in more depth before here is not
faster than regular Ram what makes it
special and what makes it more expensive
is the fact that on the fly it can
actually check for and correct errors
improving overall system reliability
this is a desirable feature for any
system that's running mission-critical
applications as for the CPUs themselves
well with a couple of exceptions they
line up almost one-to-one with the core
x-series lineup which is to say they've
got the same
at the same core counts and they even
fit in the same socket where they differ
is in these eons gaining an extra four
PCI Express lanes while losing support
for turbo boost max though it should be
noted that many of them have a higher
Turbo Boost 2.0 speed to compensate
making that last bit sort of a non-issue
and also kind of raising the question in
those two why we have to have a software
application that only works in Windows
for the desktop processors anyway so
with both benches assembled all that's
left now is to do a little bit of tuning
to make sure that our tests are fair the
main thing is just to make sure that our
memory is running at the same speed
which it is so to recap here are the
hardware configurations that were
running today now let's run some
benchmarks starting with our to 8 core
chips to see if maybe just baby there is
something that we have overlooked yeah
okay moving on to our other tests we see
the slight difference a 100 megahertz
higher base clock makes for gaming
actually giving the Xeon w21 45 an edge
over its core i7 counterpart so that's
good news if you were concerned that
your serious business workstation
wouldn't be able to game off hours you
can put those fears to rest and then as
for the heavy multi-threaded tests like
blender the differences shrink down to a
maximum of 16 seconds and don't really
seem to get any worse over time meaning
that the difference basically comes down
to how high and for how long the chips
boost during the early phase of the run
thanks to their slightly different turbo
implementations so I guess it's time for
us to do a quick chip swap here now
we're onto our second pair and just like
the previous ones the differences aren't
exactly striking neither chip really
seems to gain a firm advantage over the
other and it's a dead heat in our
synthetic gaming tests once again light
threaded workloads favor turbo boost max
and our numbers tighten up considerably
when we pour on the juice in blender
this time however we've got a maximum
delta of about a minute with the 7900 ex
taking the crown on the gooseberry
render let's try the heavy weights now
shall we we've got both systems loaded
up with their 18 core variants so which
monster cpu is more monstrous well
surprisingly our 79 80 wrecked the Xeon
w21 95 in Deus Ex thanks to its higher
bass and turbo boost clocks and while
it's not as big a victory is in our
synthetic gaming tests it's still a win
for the core I 9 and then it's the same
story across the rest of our tests
regardless of threading we also saw our
biggest upset in blender with the core
i9 winning by over a minute and a half
on the gooseberry render so if the
performance is as similar in real life
as the spec sheets would seem to
indicate with neither the consumer chips
pulling ahead in consumer workloads like
games nor the workstation chips pulling
ahead in workstation workloads it makes
it honestly pretty difficult for me to
wrap my head around the reason that this
lineup of CPUs and this chipset exists
now traditionally Zeon's based on the
consumer 11x X sockets only had ECC as
their main selling point but those came
at a relatively small premium whereas
again traditionally the expense of
Zeon's with many course well they had
the ability to run on dual socket boards
as an easy justification but this
generation lacks that capability
meaning that unless you absolutely need
vPro and ECC memory support the latter
being something that AMD's entire lineup
from rising 3 to thread Ripper supports
natively and the former being something
that Intel's own consumer products
support it kind of smells like mostly
marketing but with a subtle undertone of
extra PCI Express Lanes
so at the end of the day I think what it
comes down to is that Xeon has a lot
more brand recognition than core does in
the workstation and enterprise space
so if Intel can charge more for it I
guess they might as well but for our
viewers I'll say this as long as you
don't stand to lose a hundred bucks
worth of work every time your system
bluescreens due to a bit flip we're
recommending to stick with the consumer
core I nine private Internet access
supports a variety of VPN protocols and
types of encryption and authentication
which allows you to dial in exactly the
level of privacy protection you need
here's just a few reasons why you should
use P ia VPN it offers IP cloaking so
you can hide your true IP address and
geographic location it allows you to
browse anonymously keeping your identity
hidden it allows you to avoid data
mining and targeted advertising and
block unwanted connections with advanced
firewall and filtering capabilities to
keep all network intrusions out so check
