for an entire year that'll make another
video a year from now explaining what
the results were of said benchmark why
well because we love multi-part videos
making you wait for their conclusion no
no no seriously this time there is a
good reason we've been saying for a long
time that balanced airflow leaning on
the side of positive internal pressure
is better than very positive or any form
of negative but we've never done a
formal long term investigation and to
our knowledge neither has anyone else so
let's fix that
verdaguer zerg anomic s and plus line
gaming chairs make a great addition to
any gaming setup check them out of the
link below okay first we need to
actually establish what the different
types of internal air pressure are first
you've got negative air pressure this is
when the majority of the fan power in
your case is focused on sucking air out
of said case like if you had a rear fan
a top mounted AIO cooler blowing air up
and a single front intake then you've
got positive air pressure this is where
the majority of your fan power is
focused on pulling air into the case if
you flipped around the fans on your
radiator from the previous example it
would become positive and finally we've
got the mystical balanced or neutral
airflow where your airflow in and out of
the case equal each other the
conventional wisdom goes like so a
negative pressure setup will end up
pulling air into the case through small
gaps in the chassis that are just
unavoidable
unless case manufacturers use some type
of seal everywhere that to different
parts of the case met like your side
panels to the case for instance this
would completely destroy the usability
of the case because of air flowing
through these inevitable gaps dust is
also sucked in and accumulates
throughout your rig potentially reducing
cooling performance or even causing
component failure if left long enough
easy solution right with a positive air
pressure setup you'll be pushing air out
of those cracks instead but if you
overdo your positivity it's going to be
really turbulent inside of the case you
might end up creating pockets of hot air
that actually harm your cooling
efficiency and besides no cases that I'm
aware of are designed to have an intake
on every single fan mount so perhaps the
more balanced approach is the answer now
we here at the office have always rooted
for balanced airflow leaning slightly on
the positive side of things because
theoretically and from our anecdotal
experience we found that it's a good
balance between cooling performance
overall dust reduction and actually
being able to
control the delivery of cool air to the
zones in your PC that need it the most
like just under your graphics card and
through your CPU cooler but anecdotal
evidence has never been enough for us
here or at least it shouldn't be
so the test today is to build three
identical computers one each to
represent negative pressure very
positive pressure and mostly neutral but
leaning on the side of positive since
practically speaking it's impossible to
make a perfectly neutral airflow setup
okay so I've gathered three sets of the
same hardware this is mostly mostly some
older stuff that we can actually do
without for about a year I've got three
fractal design our fives and we're going
to put it all in these different cases
shove it somewhere in the warehouse and
then be good to go so let's build so now
that that's all done we were left with
Audi the case that I built and I had
Tyler replicate it twice for any and in
between ii any has all of the fans
blowing in the two in the front blowing
this way the two in the top blowing down
and the one in the back blowing in as
well now the two of the top blowing down
and the two in the front blowing in are
actually very realistic the one in the
back blowing in is a little bit less
realistic but we just wanted to go
hardcore with the theme od has all of
the fans blowing out so the two in the
front are blowing out the two in the top
are blowing out and the one in the back
is blowing out and then in between II is
a little bit different we have the two
in the front blowing in and two in the
bottom blowing in and then one in the
top blowing out and one in the back
blowing out the reason why we did this
was because the two in the front have to
fight with this front panel which is
actually a lot of restriction and can
only bring in air through the side and
then it has to go through a filter a lot
of restriction the bottom has to fight
with the fact that it's against the
ground and has to go through a filter as
well so we wanted to kind of overpower
the amount of air coming in because it
had to fight against these elements and
then the air going out was just fan
grills no filters or obstructions or
anything like that so we only had two of
those fans a little bit of a different
configuration but should be fine now all
we have to do is take these three
computers and shove them way back there
all right so we're somewhere that you
don't normally
and Linus tech tips videos this is
behind one of the sets about the
computers lined up OD
any in between e are all in a row so
after a year we're going to check how
much dust has accumulated in each setup
I have arranged them in a way that they
should have a minimum amount of backwash
to each other they're facing the fuzzy
wall so there's no direct intakes this
way because the intakes on the front of
the case actually come out of the sides
of the case so they're in taking from
this way and then they're shooting air
back out or in the case of any pulling
air in from the wooden wall so that
should all be fine and this is where I'm
going to leave them so now I guess we
just turn them on that one worked that
one worked that one worked and then we
wait a year Braintree is code for easy
online payments if you're building a
mobile app and searching for a simple
payment solution check out Braintree
with the Vita zero SDK which is one
small snippet of said code you're all
set up in less than 10 minutes and they
have support staff ready to walk you
through the process over the phone if
you need them their code supports
Android iOS and JavaScript clients and I
have SDKs in seven different programming
languages they make it easy to offer
multiple mobile payment types including
PayPal Apple pay Bitcoin venmo Android
pay credit cards and more all with just
one single integration to learn more

it if you dislike this video dislike it
get subscribed check out the description
down below where you can see where to
buy some stuff you saw in this video or
a Linus tech tips t-shirt which I'm
totally wearing right now I probably
screwed up the mic sorry about that
check out this video which is a workshop
video where we explore how cable
management and keeping things
unobstructed in your case isn't that
important anymore but you should
probably still Caleb major cables
anyways I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
