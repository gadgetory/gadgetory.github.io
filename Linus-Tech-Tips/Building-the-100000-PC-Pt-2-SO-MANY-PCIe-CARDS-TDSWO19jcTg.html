while since I've talked about the Oh the
hundred thousand dollar PC and I'm
approximating the cost because I
actually don't know exactly how much
it's going to end up coming to yet
because there's still a few things that
are to be determined about the final
configuration but there's a good reason
for all of that
I've been waiting on some really
important hardware to continue my
testing so right now we've got a problem
with the current configuration this
motherboard can accept a measly seven
PCI Express 16x devices I mean what kind
of chump nonsense is that for a hundred
thousand dollar computer that I aim to
have six video editors editing 8k
footage off of at the same time so I got
in touch with actually a couple of
really special companies one of them is
Thermaltake who sent over a bunch of
their PCI Express extenders I'm gonna
use these but to test running a bunch of
graphics cards off of this thing without
water blocking them all up beforehand
which is what I did last time which was
super stupid because then when I had
issues it was a nightmare and this this
is actually a bunch of boxes from that
company called one-stop systems who if
you're not in the enterprise space
you've probably never heard of but if
you are even then you might not have
heard of them and they make PCI Express
extension solutions allowing you to take
a single slot and adapt it to in this
case eight slots how does that work
oh we're gonna find out not cheaply
though
thanks to video blocks for sponsoring
this video
they're a great subscription-based
resource for downloading stock footage
video and more check out the link below
to learn more so the funny thing about
these guys was when I got in touch with
them the bloke that I spoke with was
actually a fan of the town he was like
super into working with us and he was
like yeah let me let me carry this up
the chain and then I I spoke with his
manager and she wasn't as familiar
personally but then her husband was
apparently super into Linus tech tips
and she was like okay yeah no you know
this sounds this sounds great we'd love
to work with you and then I followed up
and they basically said yeah
everything's shipped but I hadn't
actually worked out what I needed or
really talked to them about it much yet
so I'm not a hundred percent sure what's
here yet so we're gonna find out
together I did know this board was
coming so they've actually got a bunch
of different PCI Express expansion
products even you can get like chassis
that allow you to plug something from
the back of one computer into the back
of another one that looks like a
computer but it's actually just a box
full of PCI Express expansion or you can
get a bare-bones board which it would
appear is what they've sent to me but
I'm not a hundred percent sure how or if
any of it is going to work so this guy
right here is their Hib 35 X 4 this is a
PCI Express X 4 to cable adapter so this
is going to go into our system and is
going to adapt a PCI Express slot to a
table that we can plug into the back of
the system this is PCI Express over a
cable I'm not talking like you know
Thunderbolt I'm talking pure full
capability PCI Express be stopped right
look at this connector
Oh feels good we're turning the one PCI
Express slot on the other end here into
eight more eight more PCI Express slots
5/8 pin power connectors and a 24 pin
what are they expecting you to plug into
this thing honestly what they're doing
is not that unusual in fact your
motherboard you watching right now your
motherboard probably has similar
technology because you're probably aware
already if you've followed our CPU
reviews that especially mainstream CPUs
don't have a ton of PCI Express Lanes on
them so then how exactly is it that you
end up with you know for 16 X slots and
a bunch of PCIe 4x slots when your CPU
only has like 20 to 24 lanes well the
way that they do that is using what's
called a PL X chips so these are
effectively think of them as kind of
like a network switch where you take one
Ethernet connection and you split it out
to eight computers for PCI Express so
this is going to be a very high-end PCI
Express switcher chip and then you're
gonna find those same kinds of adapters
on here so that allows all of this
traffic to share this one interface now
to be clear you're not going to be able
to connect 8 16x graphics cards and get
the full performance out of all on that
exactly at the same time but I'm
planning to use it for USB 3 something
where with 6 editors not everyone's
going to be slamming it at exactly the
same moment so it should work fine knock
on wood till until your knuckles are raw
right there was another piece of
hardware that I needed to continue my
testing so we only have a couple of
octane PCI Express SSDs in the building
so what I wanted was to swap out my 750
s for these and have a look at what VM
performance looks like running on octane
RAID one the other thing I was waiting
for cable mods sent over some PCI
Express power connectors that I'm gonna
need to extend the cables for these
graphics cards that I'm going to be
running on extensions
I just found the most perfect spot for
it you guys never would have believed
that I didn't know exactly what I was
doing here so I've got the the host
adapter installed on the other side I
throw in a second power supply here and
then check this out oh that could work
ma'am you have to like pull this panel
off and maybe like laser cut them or
something but we could have all our USB
ports right on the back of the system
like that anyway for today though this
is just this is just a dry dry run I'm
gonna bring it around the other side so
with this expansion daughterboard
we're gonna have a total of six
remaining because I'm going to take up
one of the PCIe slots with the host card
plus eight so that is 14 PCI Express
slots plus all the ones that I am
adapting from the U dot two plugs on the
motherboard so 18 PCI Express slots just
the right number creep 100 okay our PCIe
power let's hook up some graphics cards
here Sally we're just gonna do 4
graphics cards for today so some of the
editors are gonna get full 16x slots for
their graphics cards and others are
gonna be stuck with a little bit less
but for the purposes of what we're doing
that's not gonna affect performance in
any meaningful way so we're just gonna
pick some random slots here it's tell
some GPUs baby so those will go there
sure so that'll go there sure yeah I
mean there does that work that kind of
reasonable we never claimed this video
wasn't gonna be madness you knew what
you were clicking on okay
leaning tower of titans at right yeah
what could go wrong
oh okay that's one I mean should we do a
quick test to make sure this even works
before we go any further
yeah okay all right let's do it
is this on what the heck oh it turned
off let's give it one more try because
if there's one slot that doesn't like a
graphics card or something like that
being in it that's going to be a big
problem because I need to fill all of
them with graphics cards Yee you know
what I think it might be is our one stop
systems expansion card because I don't
have the power supply plugged into the
target end of it yet so it might not
like something about what's going on
here so let's try it with just the
graphics card so we're not changing too
many variables at once here there it is
okay all right so while this is booting
up we need to go get ourselves another
power supply and it can't be like some
wussy power supply it's got to have I
gotta find out what kind of connectors
these are these PCI Express are they oh
oh crap they're not PCIe it's gonna be
getting so this is interesting of our
five ax 1500 eyes I apparently have
three of them and then we also have a
1600 I that Jake apparently has checked
out long term what is he what does he
need a 1600 on his test bench for okay
let's go let's go get one of the three
ax eyes that jake has so I have one on
my bench yeah so I have one in my you
know I have one in my rig at home I have
one in the desk PC
you're stupid why do you have so much
crap here can you clean this up
I mean it's working out for me right now
but in general okay what did he do
can you believe what Jake did to this
power supply you see this is why this is
why I rage out at people for like the
way that they treat the hardware around
here sometimes you say this like you've
never seen it before
literally the only person who's ever
used it and naturally the EPS connectors
aren't even in here thanks Jake should I
just fire him let me know in the
comments new plan
Jake did find another 1500 I so we're
just going to use that this is the
beauty of modular power supply is like
how else would you have ended up being
able to Frankenstein a regular desktop
power supply to power this weird board
all we got to do is this well I mean it
makes it look like there's something
wrong with it why did you put so much
tape on it now I have no idea
what triggers this thing to turn on here
we go alright
that's all looking peachy editor don't
include that these guys were very
gracious to send us this stuff and I
don't want them to see that the bloke
that I spoke with was actually a fan of
the channel now I do want to know if
it's working so here why don't we grab
our obtained drives and throw those on
there see that happens obviously there's
something like a high-speed storage
device we're not expecting to get our
full performance out of it in this kind
of a situation - but I just want to know
if it's working at all this is
terrifying everything about this is
wrong let's take a picture for Instagram
there they are
there's the opt-in SSDs just like that
basically plug and play you just have to
make sure you actually plug all the
things it may not look like much but
she's got it where it counts kid right
gorgeous so our opt-in drives are being
picked up by the OS and via me zero and
one and this is what I really need to
know this is gonna tell me if this whole
thing is gonna work or not because if I
can't pass through the controllers
individually then there's I'm not gonna
be able to get everything hot probably
look at all of these plx bridges here
that is madness so the update is mostly
bad news there is what's called an ACS
override patch that you can enable to
try to break individual items that are
in a single Iowa MMU group out into
their own iommu groups but as far as I'm
read knows the the code for the patch
has been broken since Intel skylake and
it doesn't seem to be working here
obviously this is much newer than
skylake but they have suggested that if
we shut this baby down pull the card out
and put it in a Haswell or older system
and see if that works that maybe they
could try
fixing the patch to work on skylake and
then it might work in this system so
that's our that's our first step here
well I'm not running this for very long
so we're just gonna put that there yeah
okay yeah that seems pretty stable all
right so this is where we find out if
the hack will potentially work with our
PCI Express splitter device one thing
that's nice is how plug-and-play this
thing's been these SSDs are both showing
up perfectly just plugged into a
consumer board so that's pretty cool
and honestly we should still get some
use out of it even if it just means that
all of our USB cards that we have
plugged into it can't be passed through
the VMS it'll still be nice to have all
of those ports ok so I can't reach my
contact on rates so what I'm gonna do
then is just throw some USB cards in
here and see if we can pass one through
to something everything continues to get
more ghetto now we have SSDs hanging off
here aren't they beautiful
our NSS USB controller is showing up
here that's one of the ones that's
plugged into the daughter board but we
still don't know if the override worked
so let's go ahead and let this populate
remember this doesn't tell us if we can
get it working this tells us if maybe we
could get it working this looks like a
very big group so this is all the PL x
tono
all the same dammit
okay it's not all bad we still get the
benefits of using a PCI Express switch
for all our USB devices so everything
that we do hook up will be better
managed and the whole thing does work
really seamlessly I had just really
hoped for hot plug and it looks like
that might be out of my grasp
however cool this hardware might be have
you ever needed a beautiful shot of like
mountains or wild animals or even
something like an astronaut in space for
your video but you didn't have the time
or budget to get it yourself
well videoblocks has you covered with
unlimited downloads through their member
library that contains over a hundred and
fifteen thousand HD and 4k clips along
with After Effects templates motion
backgrounds and more an additional
marketplace for other footage is also
available so if you're a member you say
40% and you get to support the artists
because videoblocks
doesn't take a single cent all the
footage on video blocks is royalty-free
which means you can keep and use the
clip as many times as you want forever
and new footage gets added regularly so
you'll always have fresh new content to
check out and use get all of this with
an unlimited member planet video blocks
today at the link below so thanks for
watching guys hopefully you enjoyed
coming along for what would normally be
like a behind-the-scenes type of
troubleshooting for a project like this
if you guys disliked this video you
could hit that button but if you liked
it hit like get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description as long as you don't
plan to use PCI pass-through for the
individual things you have plugged into
it for each one of your VMs oh I just
had a new thought wait what if every
single slot thought its own daughter
board with the GPU and the usb on bat
okay that's probably a project for
another day let's just get the video
editing working
that's one system anyway subscribe and
check out our merch and we have that
