brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys we're here at
the Zelman suite checking out the
resonator 3 max a dual I know as some of
you will remember the residue max review
I had from a while ago where it was
thrown under the bus a little bit but
we'll have to see how this one performs
in the office later on in a later date
it has a few definitely redeeming
features first and foremost there's
removable fans and the keel management
for those fans is actually quite cool it
runs through the middle of each of the
120 millimeter sides and gets cable
manage behind it in a little space so
nice little pocket it's got there which
is actually pretty neat and then it also
has center mounted tubes something
you've seen a lot of builds is people
will turn the radiator around and then
the tubing has to go over their RAM or
if it's on the other side there's way
too much tubing or whatever happens
there so it's actually kind of cool if
you don't have to cross way over top of
the motherboard which is nice for
features other than that it's fairly
standard fare other than the shrouds on
the fans and it has the same mounting
mechanism that I had in the Zalman
resonator 3 max originally next up we
have the Zed 15 or Zi 15 depending on
where you're from this one has a few
cool features so the control panel on
the top aside from standard fare being
use 2 USB 3.0 2 USB 2.0 a hard drive LED
reset button power button mic and
headphone ports it also has some
interesting fan control so you have your
normal not too surprising dials for
front rear and top but one cool thing
about these is you can completely turn
the fans off a lot of them you just turn
them down these ones you can completely
turn them off which is quite cool and
the coolest part is right now I have it
in what I like to call and one of the
other guys here likes to call
Lamborghini mode where it's all flared
up and looks super awesome and is a
little bit flare e and you can turn it
down so if you're gaming you can have it
in this mode and if your mom comes and
uses computer and goes on Facebook she
can have her nice calm sedan so she can
calm down have a cool day and it's fine
and everything's down it's not too super
flare e it's not out there it's okay
one of the other cool things too though
is that you can have it on auto based on
temperature settings so 35 degrees or 45
degrees both Celsius now if it gets
above either one of those thresholds it
will then open the top go into
Lamborghini mode which is not the name
for it but it'll go into Lamborghini
and just uh it's cool how that's Auto
and it's cool how that works just so
seamlessly so if you had it on auto and
your mom went on Facebook it would
automatically go into sedan mode which
is also not the name for it and then if
you decide to start gaming it would
automatically go up if the system got
that hot and finally we have these Al
Abbar the front camera on this L bar is
720 p the rear camera on this L bar is
480p and that's pretty good resolution
but they have a new one coming up at
some point in time which is gonna have a
front camera of 1080p which will be
really nice and a rear camera of we're
not entirely sure yet it has quite a few
features that is really nice for
evidence building first off is the rear
camera which I've already stated but
then you can also plug in a GPS which
will state how fast you're going and
where you were on a Google map so if
you're reviewing the information from
the SOL bar and trying to present it to
someone say you could see the front
camera the rear camera your speed and
your GPS location which is absolutely
awesome the camera also has a gyro in it
so it can figure out if there was a
collision so say you're parked you're
not in your car it's not currently
recording and someone rams into you it
will take some pictures and start
recording so that you can figure out who
that was so even if you're not in the
car you can still build evidence if
there was an accident
