about the geek out but I have to take
what they say with a grain of salt
because they are a division of light
harmonic the same company that brought
us the ten gigabit light speed USB cable
a thousand-dollar USB 2 cable for chumps
so welcome to my review of the geek out
450 with the purchase of a qualifying
Intel processor SSD or nook you could
instantly win and Intel gaming Jersey
and be entered in the draw for the
ultimate system click now to learn more
all right so some of the stuff that they
claim is outlandish but that doesn't
mean everything that light Harmonix says
is going to be pure rubbish so first up
and this is legitimately pretty cool the
geek out natively decodes and amplifies
pretty much any kind of audio signal
that you can throw at it all the way
from your cheapo mp3s to high sample
rate 384 kilohertz 32-bit PCM and even
DSD 128 I mean we're talking individual
songs that are 500 Meg's at the high end
there and it does all that stuff in a
very appealing form factor it's actually
smaller than my previous carry around
USB amp and DAC the file eet n2 which I
will be comparing it and it's more
feature laden to boot inside the fairly
robust shipping box you get a handy
little carrying bag a USB to cable in
case your ports are a bit cramped and
the unit itself which has a pleasing
subtle brushed finish on the aluminum
housing on the front are LED indicators
to let you know what the DAC is doing
and on the back is a key to help you
interpret the aforementioned LED
indicators on the top we've got the USB
interface on the right are the volume
buttons that offer surprisingly granular
sound level adjustments although be sure
to turn your system volume down when
first firing this baby up since
otherwise it will be really really loud
and they have an extra feature called
the 3d awesome a fire that is supposed
to make your music sound more like it's
surrounding you and less in your head
which can be activated by holding both
buttons at the same
for about a second I would have
preferred a dial here because it would
make adjusting volume by feel easier and
additionally I didn't find the 3d
feature made much of a difference with
headphones and with some IMS I actually
found that it added a significant
background hiss that was extremely
distracting finally on the bottom is
where the headphones go up to two pairs
of them which is actually a super cool
feature if you sometimes listen with a
friend if you're listening alone bear in
mind the impedance rating next to the
jacks that's the output impedance of
that output so the point for 7:01 will
likely be best for your headphones
unless you're driving larger cans with
higher impedance LH Labs recommends this
model for up to a hundred ohm rated
headphones with a higher end geeked-out
1000 model available for big guns like
the Odyssey LCD twos either output will
work but pairing your gear correctly
will deliver the best results alright so
what's the process of actually using
this thing like on Mac and Linux no
drivers are needed but since apparently
Windows isn't a hundred percent
compliant lift devices that support
asynchronous USB audio class - you need
a driver on Windows it's unfortunate but
not a complete deal-breaker in my mind
once you download and install the
necessary file you need to do is for
standard listening change your default
audio device as usual with that finished
we can do listening tests now right not
yet I actually added an extra step and I
can't find the bloody thing right now
but we'll overlay it I added an extra
step that was missing in my last amp 2
amp comparison a sound level meter to
help me ensure that the volume was the
same between each amp I used a 1
kilohertz test tone and dialed a
champion at 85 decibels with each
headphone before doing any side-by-side
listening this is really important
because pretty much across the board
people will report that louder music
sounds better if all other things are
equal so I started with my usual
listening methodology top 40 music from
the Google Play Music Store on my
favorite headphones my HD 8 DJ's and
then I threw in a pair of DT 770 Pro 80
ohms for variety and side-by-side at
reasonable listening volume there's no
difference with either of these
headphones that I can detect at higher
volumes like if we get irresponsible and
just crank it till it sounds fun
the geeked-out scales noticeably better
than the e10 without sound getting
unbalanced or distorted though so that's
a definite point in its favor if you're
into that of course this product wasn't
designed for your typical streaming
quality music files though it was
designed for high definition audio files
so after the usual I decided to mix
things up a little bit and order this
album in four flavors from the 2l music
store I went with high quality 320
kilobit per second mp3 44 kilohertz
16-bit CD quality flak 192 kilohertz
24-bit high res flak and finally the six
gig mother of all albums DSD 128 quality
the highest quality one they provided I
then followed this yamaha guide combined
with this imager post to correctly
configure fubar to even play the super
high resolution files found myself a
quiet room to sit in and tried
desperately to tell the difference
between any of them now to be clear
crummy mp3s are rubbish and easy to pick
out of a lineup
but these high bitrate ones I don't know
man sometimes I was sure the flacks had
a little bit more detail and dynamic
range but other times I was equally sure
that there was no difference at all and
for myself if the difference between
high-end high-definition audio files and
high quality mp3s
is that difficult to hear then I'll save
my hard drive space and money so back to
the product itself for the conclusion
subjectively must be my tin ear but when
it comes to anthems a cup grades
unusually pretty hard-pressed to tell
the difference compared to changing out
headphones so I'll focus here on what
you get objectively you get format
compatibility that really is exceptional
if you feel like that sort of thing is
important you get a compact USB amp that
is legitimately better than what your PC
or as this amusing image from a head
file user demonstrates other device
probably has onboard and third you get
to feel like one of the cool kids for
having a neato device that enables you
to get the moe
Stud of your high definition music
collection and that you can also put in
your pocket just don't do both of those
things at the same time because this
puppy kiss mucho hot when it's running
speaking of mucho hot mass drop has a
seriously hot drop right now and I don't
know where that mod mic ended up ah
there it is
there's a speaking of mucho hot mass
drop has a seriously hot drop available
now the mod mic 4.0 which you can check
out my review of here
it's a mic that you can attach to any
pair of headphones to provide clear
voice communications while still
enjoying the sound quality of a proper
pair of high-end headphones as opposed
to a gaming headset it's pretty
affordable as it is but for the next
week mass drop is offering you the
insane price of we don't know yet so
there will be a graphic I'm sure most of
you have heard of mass drop by now but
if you haven't you should definitely
check them out there are site that
facilitates group buys for a wide
variety of products from clothing to
multi tools like blood Ehrman wave to
computer hardware like the mod Mike they
work directly with manufacturers and
distributors to guarantee you the best
price available and they ship to as many
countries as the manufacturer will allow
they have two options to buy you can buy
in at any price or you can commit to buy
and only confirm your order if the drop
reaches the lowest price I've used them
before my team uses them and I know that
many of you probably use them already
anyway so I have no issues fully
recommending mass drop and to top it off
they're actually giving away a few units
of the mod Mike to some of our lucky
viewers just sign up using the link in
the video description and you will be
entered to win but lightest you might
say I've already got a mass drop account
because they're awesome how do I enter
they've got you covered just leave a
comment below this video mentioning
