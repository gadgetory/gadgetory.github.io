don't think this should be here really
this probably shouldn't be here
the majority of this shouldn't be here
these people are probably okay because
they're carrying candy we should like
build this out of candy yes we totally
lost the vision that's I'm gonna throw a
lot of that on me okay but like let's
tear a bunch of it down and rebuild it
with candy with candy done so we can use
the white things as like candy boulders
as candy boulders we can glue them
together we can make the trees like
we're originally planning we can build
this largely a bit cat and some other
thing I think that tree could have
leaves of this yeah like so we can use
some of the stuff as platforms to put
more candy but nothing can exist without
cane I do still want to leave this okay
but then it needs to candy everywhere it
needs to be central candy Park yeah yeah
yeah I know I know and then like but we
can like make a bench I would have
KitKat like this shouldn't be here
because that should be too little broken
pieces of KitKat and one long actual
piece of kit cat got it you know I mean
yeah candy construction land needs to
totally happen over here that's gonna
look pretty too hard we should like ship
this to knock to it when we're done like
here
someone finally made a computer that
makes sense with your color scheme think
I left the screws for the keyboard in
the keyboard box
hey the screws to the keyboard are
inside the keyboard good job previous me
my hope is just that the judges
appreciate attention to detail rather
than gimmicky light shows they probably
won't plate not helping tech showdown is
brought to you by synergy 2 in
partnership with g.skill be quiet and
cable mod synergy 2 makes sharing your
mouse and keyboard between multiple
computers so simple that anyone can use
it
learn more at the link below how does my
butt look in these jeans we can rock
we're rolling
we're good ok so where were we so we
need to jump on desk lighting lighting
it's a pump mounting so it works with
the front res and we need to paint the
key caps
look here you got a fan cable there
buddy in the mob yes I could look
homeboy
another leg on their muscle oh yeah yeah
throw longer okay so originally I was
gonna tie these two lights on top with
the light strip in between but the way
Bob put the other three lights in we
didn't need to do that but left us with
this tail leg on our lighting kit and so
I've just got an RGB strip and this will
fit right in here
and just help illuminate all that and
once the lights are down just a little
bit all the light will catch the light
and look really awesome I hung out with
some Canadians at the bar once and they
tested me to make sure I was worthy you
know they only had a couple questions
they want to know if I'd watch hockey
and if I drink beer and do I like to
fight and I said yes to all three and
they said you're in this is gonna have
to look forward I think the highlights
on our case are going to be obviously
color you've got bright colors white and
pink it's really clean you look at it
and we've done just a little bit of
modification and so you can still see
where it looks like the stock chassis
boat by adding a reservoir in the front
on the outside I think it's probably one
of the biggest okay I need if I'll I'll
push in on it when you slide there we go
tada
the whole thing oh I think we both kind
of look like we don't have enough time
be honest I think we should have no
tools down tonight yeah
just keep on working I've got nothing
else to do
if you guys are down I think that might
be better for everyone off camera last
night we did finish up the cabling for
the back of our case and I gave in and
we did the B II and then I also sponge
painted some of the mistakes so I think
it looks pretty clean so we're ready to
put that finishing touch on the back so
plan for today then you're on diorama
town yeah and then I'm on cotton balling
the bottom so I have actually a blue sky
panel thing that I put in my car last
night honestly I don't think it's gonna
work that well its got like a corrugated
Brown backing so what we're thinking now
is we just create cloud that our city is
floating on and then we've got like a
letter to the judges that we can write
so we're gonna leave that with our setup
and hopefully they'll understand that
this is a city floating in the clouds
made of candy awesome that looks great
looks really good actually that's really
sharp damn alright okay okay what if we
use these little cone things and we
reduce some of the action that's going
on up here oh yeah you want to use the
cones yeah so as like caution this is
where the cables going like instead of
hide it like pointed out make it kind of
cool sir you know what I'm I'm down I'm
into that
that was okayed that's gonna say Central
Park and I'm hoping one of the judges is
going to appreciate it enough for it to
be worth something
this time I'm spending on it so I
decided to go with like something that
would look like it could be a letter so
it's like a weird slightly cursive P I
think will be pretty good because I want
it to look appealing
I think we're gonna lose but I think we
did a pretty good job so I'm okay with
it
we've done worse
okay how's it look from the particulates
see it yeah I don't think you're going
darker let's start getting a little red
with our power cord
knock it up just a bit yeah we can bring
it up just add a little more red
Oh perfect
it's about the whole package
what size
I mean I don't know about too many
hearts because I don't know I want to be
overly thing it's a can of things if
that's why I was like using some of the
white ones too
yeah
over spam
oh look at him oh my god he's getting
out the paint's got the brush
two minutes left watch head oh yeah I
think we're done I think we're gonna say
here stand here yeah we're gonna eat
candy hold on I feel like sometimes what
you see on camera personalities and what
they're like sometimes when they're sort
of in that reality setting and they're
filming and you are under time
constraints you never know what's gonna
happen I'm expecting to see some
bomb-ass computers and if I don't I'll
be very disappointed there should be at
least one with fireworks coming off of
it and if there's not I don't know what
I'm doing here Bob and rod I know rod
does some pretty cool stuff with
machining so I feel like there's might
look more sorry Linus but I think it
might look more professional I think it
might look more like they they used some
real tools to put it together so one of
the things that I'm going to be
interested to see is what do they do
with the keyboards because obviously it
has to be functional and if you're
putting candy on a keyboard some things
can really go wrong so I don't know
that's gonna be pretty cool to see what
they do from rod and Bob I expect to see
something a little more you know it's
exciting but it's not gonna like blow
your face up with its ridiculousness you
know it's gonna be like Oh refined and I
don't I don't mean that to say anything
rude about lightness and Luke I just
feel like you know there they go balls
to the wall that's inappropriate I think
I'm more interested in will this system
survive in a real user environment or
does it just fall apart the day after it
gets deployed synergy 2 is designed to
be easier and more seamless to use than
synergy 1 features include sharing from
anywhere with automatic control of any
other computer without reconfiguring SSL
encryption to protect your keystrokes
from attackers dynamic networking so it
detects the best route based on your
setup and being able to always run in
the background on all your operating
systems so you can set and forget and it
even works across VPNs and tricky home
network
if you get the pro version you can get
access to other cool features too like
clipboard sharing dragging and dropping
files copy pasting lock screen
synchronization and lots more go well
well well this is ridiculous
this is way better than I expected what
there's actual like presentation candy
station do you think they might have had
a little extra time yeah what I couldn't
have made that in four days this is far
too much effort for Luke and - I'm just
gonna say right now I mean a table
that's been painted look at this really
went all out
there's even draw heat wait there's
candy inside of the machine I'm not
really seeing the flaws I was expecting
to see I can find plenty of like the
candy tray oh you were coming in here
being like oh that's what I do
they're not gonna be able to PC as good
as I could it's pretty impressive I
think I was thinking is like a candy
theme I mean I was actually picturing
candy just taped and glued onto things
so my expectations were way different
than what we're seeing here it's it's
the overall presentation but like you
know are we supposed to give them extra
points because they just got some candy
and jars here yeah oh you label the jar
Wow do you want a job organizing my
warehouse maybe yeah I think so because
function and usability is on the list so
if I'm sitting here this is gonna save
me so much time from going to the
kitchen I could just eat my candy here
and I don't have to do anything else
same pink cable ties back here going the
extra effort that's that's another level
okay
LEDs
this is you know it's a little rough
around the edge god I can't believe she
knows are like nitpicky oh oh yeah yeah
a little bit hmm oh very disappointed
very disappointed it's not even that bad
but I'm just looking for things at this
point okay let's take a look let's see
the Merrill's does it work yes is this a
real fly or is this part of the slide
it's a real fly is the fly part of this
well you never know maybe they were like
you know flies hang around food
sometimes I will say if there's a key
that I'm looking for and I don't know
where it is I'm screwed
ah yeah if there's a way bigger pieces
you can see the letters oh yeah that
keyboard isn't you can't tell what key
is which that's a point off for
functionality functionality
functionality floating bit what is this
font I can't give you extra points if I
can't read it that's like the most basic
script font that you can find in a word
processor it's like I think it's
actually called script
life is simple sorry you wanna go for it
you've got a choice
all right life is simple in this
floating paradise among the clouds the
blue-collar candy folk are hard at work
in the factory making the most delicious
candy treats for the citizens while the
candy town Express makes its way through
Tandi town Central Park Central Park
don't you just have a video with that in
it I thought okay why is this blowing
your mind I have like sort of an inside
joke it's hard to describe it's like
it's like a general positive sentiment
if you're like hey let's do you want to
hang out tomorrow
central pack you know or like no we're
like what do you think of this thing I
just didn't a central bank it's
nonsensical they're appealing to you
yeah you can't let yourself be biased by
this
yeah pristine no I don't know I don't
know if I can be objective but anyways
continue but our chocolate themes candy
factory makes it more than just yummy
things to eat it also makes the fastest
most beautiful frames for the hottest
most intense games nice nicely done
service sit and enjoy a relaxing and
refined computing experience with the
people of upper candy town
gaming should be intense but it
shouldn't be stressful yours some
signatures not sure what they say take a
look at this because I see a lot of
things going on here number one as a
sanitary caution I do like that this
desk definitely kept everything
contained we've got Kit Kats
sitting very close and also you know I
mean sometimes computers do get a little
warm depending upon what you've got
going on here taking yours apart now is
health concern and judging cabin
chocolate covered everything you can see
the letters on the keyboard which is
very important I know this is not fair
this is a personal touch this is I don't
know if I can be objective now central
pack seems real bad I don't know that I
can be objective why are you the
favorite one oh that's true
I don't know you have this much control
over life
I didn't know either let's make sure
that this works okay that works it's
functional oh yeah you have to make sure
yeah oh man oh the Train is functional
my heart they did a really good paint
job though yeah
is this a paint job I'm assuming that is
Pam yeah cuz it's fine it's fine you got
to do the same test oh yeah yeah oh I
found a flaw oh that's where that thing
first I found what appears to be either
just some some bad touch of paint over
here or a fingerprint which means we may
be able to identify the creative to the
lab and then you do a Batman so um okay
what is this what's the deal so we got
chocolate yeah cuz like the other one
you know there's kind of like a distinct
pink and pink and white theme but like
we got chocolate here and then we got
multicolored keys so what are these what
is this just kind of a general candy
thing I don't know are these custom or
is this why are the media cues is black
out oh that's a good point
looks like it was bought as a set to me
did they run out of fun paint or I mean
I don't think this is or did the set not
come with you it's gotta be a set that
doesn't count so there's a couple
there's one I don't know if it's a
fingerprint there's a spot right there
that and then there's if you got the
light oh yeah there's some there there's
some there
well there's one down here guys one
right there Steve and I are very
disappointed about this yes yes I can't
believe it does this one have the same
flaws oh my god if they looked at your
monitor anywhere near as close as
they're looking at mine
they thought the really the
our monitor which is like a little
napkin yeah but you guys got paint on
the day you talk less so we can hear
with the judge this is very this is like
a pretty nice diorama though you know I
can there's definitely two different
feels here like this is like this feels
like it could be an actual in someone's
actual room if they were like super into
candy and pink and this feels like and
this feels like you know it's like more
of an art piece to display and yeah
Santro pack I mean they are both so
incredibly different that it's really
it's gonna be a difficult decision I
think the fans have been painted as well
offsetting the weight of the fan blades
potentially causing damage down the line
oh there's like a thing over here ah are
they like cleaning up the garbage
there's like the main diagram over there
and then in the back they're hiding the
garbage this is cool I eat Oh toxic
waste one thing that they did do is
they're very thoughtful in their making
of this whole design that's true
oh that's extremely dusty Wow
how would they how would you even put
dust on something intentionally I don't
know this is a prime impress impressed
with their attention to detail
yeah that paint splashes on the inside
this one you know the kind of splotches
here the ones on the monitor whatever's
going on on the top up here it's just
like a wannabe griptape paint I guess I
feel like I feel like this has to be
Luke and - because bob is a really good
painter hmm and I'm not saying that this
isn't a good job but well then why don't
you look at his paint job a little
closer to Steven okay wait what's going
on here is this a fake reservoir like
they have a tube going here that looks
like it's part of the regular loop but
it's running in the middle is it I'm
going through it the team is going
through oh is it okay cool that is very
nice completely impressed so it's
decoration there's no fluid running
through it but it's completely
impractical to cool a CPU with candy so
I mean you need more more coolant yeah
exactly so I don't I don't know but it
looks cool it does it does look cool
right we don't even know the thermal
conductivity of that candy going into
this one of the judging criteria was the
wow factor and for me I think I might
have actually said wow so bonus points
for that yeah yeah when she walked in
she said Wow Wow the second I saw you
guys do you want to buy it I was like
and the floor to ceiling oh yeah that
says wow yeah yeah when I walked in and
saw this this was by far exceeding any
expectations that I had coming into this
you know when they said candy was a
theme I mean I pictured taping down
candy on things and just sort of going
really overboard with a theme what they
did here was really took that theme and
played to that from the colors we may
even went so far as going to the craft
store and getting these random party
supplies and wrapping it all the way
around the desk
they even wrapped this around the back
that's definitely something thoughtful
this desk I mean they've got these
custom panels here into houses some
display candy the only complaint that I
have is they also were talking about you
know if a normal person who is
not completely tech-savvy would come
down and sit at this keyboard they
painted over all of the letters and
numbers and symbols so that may kind of
hinder some functionality the mouse also
custom painted I think we all have kind
of have that same discussion of if you
really want to use the mouse you're
probably going to end up pulling it out
of the socket here but you know yeah
like if she like a low sensitivity gamer
free samples
definitely for A+ I know we've been
talking about this imperfection here
using the candy to cover up the flaws
but I think that's what we all do so I'm
okay with that
the case is very well painted I love
that they completely modded this front
panel they even went so far as putting
candy inside of the case and I feel like
it is placed strategically so hopefully
none of it will melt which is could be a
disaster I kind of do like the rainbow
LED Ram that they have in there - I know
we're discussing maybe it should have
all been pink but it does kind of play
into the whole candy theme I also like
that their candy is in jars I know that
might sound crazy but the competition
has candy all over the table
they made a candy station sign they even
have a nice little list of modifications
which I feel like this is one of those
things where you walk into a candy store
and it's like oh this is the menu of
what we have they this is crazy I'm
super overwhelmed and I also think this
might have been swayed because if they
knew I was a judge then this is
something that I would definitely be
gravitating towards so a plus so I would
say some of the negatives definitely the
mouse doesn't work as it should the
keyboard they painted over all of the
letters and numbers so I feel like if
any normal person who comes down here
and does not have this entire thing
memorized like most of us they may have
a few issues with that there are a few
little smudges of paint the free samples
kind of hide imperfections but I'm not
going to knock that too much and
hopefully you didn't want to wirelessly
charge your phone because they did
about the Qi charger for the free
samples which to be completely fair is
okay in my book
everything else though looks pretty good
I mean I think it was kind of a stretch
for a lot of us that really kind of dig
in and find some imperfections the Qi
charger who cares about the teet sorry
man why does the Qi charger matter
alright so over here we've got our
chocolate Wonderland central pock
clearly a nice little inside joke which
inside jokes are fun when everyone's
included but I guess that's not how
inside jokes work I mean they even went
so far through the night we'll print it
out note she's after us for the inside
joke in the letter man and she went she
put it like on top of yeah yeah probably
the number one downfall I would say to
this as somebody who is a candy
connoisseur this is not sanitary there's
no way that you should be leaving candy
out like this I mean there are actual
flies I don't know if you guys can see
this but they are landing on the candy
and these gumdrops have dust on them so
that is definitely some points that I'm
gonna have to take away as somebody who
may want to potentially eat this you
should it it is no longer edible I will
say though they did a really great job
over the overall theme when you look at
this you definitely can say yes we get
it it's a chocolate beam I mean this
entire case is very well painted every
little bit of it kind of has sort of a
chocolatey feel they did a really great
job of painting this monitor that there
was a point I would have been convinced
that this was manufactured this way
there are a few smudges in the back here
but overall at least the front where it
really counts it looks really really
good they did take a little bit more
attention to detail in the inside here
they painted some more of the insides as
you guys can see here one thing that I
would say is I'm not really sure why
they decided to leave all of these racks
there you probably could have removed
those
and if they were gonna leave those in it
could have been something cool to sort
of add a little more integration of the
candy-themed but when I walked in I
don't feel like this had that wow factor
that we were all looking for as far as
functionality goes let's just test this
out so say I'm sitting here for a day at
work all right it's time to edit I'm
using my mouse and I start knocking over
candy and I start knocking over these
little figures this is not that
functional why is she moving here yeah
small cities definitely have to take off
some points for that the keyboard looks
great this is not custom painted as far
as I can tell these four buttons here
don't match the rest of it but I do like
the keyboard looks great there's black
in the rest of there we thought about
this thought about we thought about
doing them accent stuff around you can
see the paint peel fit so there may be
some strategy to where things are placed
like for example this bribery tray when
you take the candy out there's some
paint peel in here but that's also kind
of a custom tray so they've removed the
Qi charger some points for that they've
got a tray I guess to put stuff in
instead there's some paint damage but
overall not so bad and countering that
the front panel here is a custom panel
so the feels like just a plastic shroud
has been placed in okay maybe we didn't
give Steve enough credit internally the
liquid cooling continues you can see it
goes through this sort of fake false
reservoir with candy in it it's a nice
touch there there's a black smudge on
the paint for the side panel in the
front corner of the case but overall
considering it was a four day
competition the paint here is looking
pretty good it's it's not peeled really
anywhere except for that one spot
there's two chips
well one chip where it looks like
accidental damage a smudge over here the
rest of it is
I mean there's no the monitor doesn't
have any smudges on it I'm like the
other monitor I think the only thing
really to take points off for would
primarily be those chips and smudges
that the one or two there are
except for usability so the table mods
leaving here that's being used to
contain all of the cables prevents me
from actually using this my house where
I want to which is back here further on
the desk so I think that's my review of
this one moving on to the other one
they had a note here that was clearly
not addressed to me some I've got some
ethical concerns with this system
already so I don't know we might have to
disqualify one of the judges but I'm not
saying that we should I'm just saying
it's it's an idea to consider in terms
of the system itself so layout is the
tables a lot less impressive they just
kind of put like a green mat on top of
it as opposed to the oven which is all
custom painted some fuzziness going on
on the bottom to look like marshmallows
I guess but that's really all there is
in terms of the table layout for the
system there are quite a few flaws with
this one so the monitor has a lot of
paint smudges fingerprints things like
that on the backside of the monitor
internally I think I don't recall seeing
any major paint problems internally but
I will point out that the fans are
painted so that's an extra step the
waterblock is painted which is an extra
step I think the other one didn't have
quite as much work done internally
I'm told that this case was originally
black so if that's the case and they I
don't remember if these are white on the
stock case or not but if they're not
then that was effort to but on the front
panel
couple more smudges couple more
fingerprints kind of a grip tape feeling
to the pan up here which means that it's
got some white fuzz on the top the Qi
charger works though
so that's kid there's some paint dust
kind of on the
the sound damping film there's some
paint dust on the dust filter for the
fans again our paint is behind there so
give and take on each side power supply
has been painted a bit a bit we've got
media keys that don't match threat to
the theme so this this build overall I
feel like it's a little more chaotic but
the internal work completely there was a
lot more done on it so like I said give
and take on each side but I think that
pretty much wraps up my review of both
of these systems I like that it's called
the candy station because it's a station
for candy both literally and
figuratively
because PC gaming is a treat overall I
really like how this one is more of a
cohesive kind of singular design it kind
of looks like an Extreme Home Makeover
when like the kid says I like pink and
white and then they make the whole room
pink and white like as a candy station
it works
there's accessible candy that's
functional in terms of like there's
candy that you can grab and eat also
here I'll talk about that later
you have room to use the keyboard and
mouse and not like not be knocking over
things as we'll get to what I don't
understand is how all of these people
are using their keyboards and mice my
computer now I don't know it doesn't
jump out at me as much as like whoa this
is like an original thing that I've
never seen before it looks like a clean
PC gaming station build which is great
it's it's not as much as there's not a
bunch of a cool factor but maybe again
maybe that's just me as a judge you know
Justine was saying that it like really
jumps out to her so like that's fair
that's fair I'm judging Justine in this
competition yeah me too
this is sort of a modding competition in
some ways it is literally everyone
single possible with yeah this is this
is a completely custom solution here
with the res
on the outside I also really like how it
kind of looks like cotton candy I don't
know if that was intentional or not but
it looks like cotton candy they captured
the essence of it up here though in
terms of functionality they took out the
Qi charger in order to have a receptacle
for candy so that's what I mean it's not
so much a positive or a negative as it
is a trade-off you're taking away that
XI charging you're adding the candy
bucket this is a bit patronizing like I
can't tell what you did just saying well
it's a candy shop clothes I'm just
kidding that's great so over here I'm
very conflicted I'm very conflicted
because coming right into this I have a
letter written to me as if from a secret
lover giving me something that I connect
with immediately the central pack it's
definitely not as universal of a concept
but I am conflicted because I know that
it's oh I feel I've got the feels
looking at it I was like oh my gosh this
is real but at the same time I know that
it's junk for me so I don't know is that
sucking up I don't know yeah it's
definitely sucking up I feel like it's a
little more creative they kind of like
used this as a canvas to paint this
picture of the town of candy town what
are the inhabitants thinking in their
daily lives
Linus brought this up seriously he did
he's like every single person has to
have a purpose if we could ask them what
is it like what is daily life like in
candy town is is pushing your
wheelbarrow to work every morning is
that hard on you does the candy melt in
the hot Sun sometimes these are the
things that we want to know and it makes
you think deep down so I really
appreciate that I was very nice to see
that they it's like a 3d experience
there's the the the secret toxic waste
dump in the back one thing I will say
the other judges mentioned the dust and
I will also I'm confused about how there
is dust on this stuff
like didn't you just finish this wanted
a lead-in let's do this thing
alright so for my scoring starting with
the pink and white build pink and white
one I thought had the fewest flaws in
the paint but had some functionality
concerns so overall concept and theme I
gave it a 7 aesthetics and execution I
gave it an 8 and functionality I gave it
a 5 and 4 the brown system here I
thought the the brown was a little
off-putting top the theme overall is a
little more chaotic but it had some
functionality or the other one didn't
serve that one concept and theme six out
of ten
aesthetics execution five out of ten for
paint smudges and other problems with
the paint functionality and usability
eight out of ten so for me the candy
station was very overall like a clean
design I think it worked better as sort
of like something that somebody would
design for like a client so for concept
and theme I gave it a 7
aesthetics execution and cool factor 9
functional functionality and usability 9
because I think it was a little bit more
functional than this one and for this
one very conflicted but I got very warm
and fuzzy feelings from the central pack
overall it looked like a more artistic
take with a more candy and the whole
theme with the with the town and
everything so that was very very nice
concept and theme I gave them a 9
aesthetics and execution 9 functionality
functionality and usability 6 out of 10
so I feel like the candy station
definitely caught my eye not to be a
stereotype or anything but it was pretty
awesome so I feel like if I was a client
I said hey I like pink and shiny
sparkles and this was exactly what you
good but as far as the concept and theme
I thought it was incredible but I just
felt like I wasn't ready to give it a 10
so I gave it a 9 out of 10 but the
aesthetics and cool factor I did give a
10 because as soon as I walked in I was
like wow this is awesome
functionality and usability I did give
it a 7 because I did struggle a little
bit to use the mouse and you know I was
a little bit worried about the candy
inside like if I wanted to actually eat
that then
be a little bit of a struggle so I had
to really take the consideration also
the keyboard - I felt like you guys I
was like what if I need to find the
letter that I'm not sure of it's on
there could you guys painted over it but
overall I thought it was really fun and
then we're over here - - and the
Chocolate Factory this was really it was
pretty fun because chocolate is one of
my favorite you know candy choices but
the one thing that I didn't like is
because I do love candy a lot the candy
started getting a little dusty because
it was being left out so that was a
little bit of a struggle we also did
notice some little paint smudges and
stuff on the back but overall it was a
very chaotic theme but it was very fun
so so four concept and theme I gave it a
9 out of 10 because it was very fun
aesthetics and execution and cool factor
it was a six and then the functionality
seven because I felt like the mouse was
too close to candy and there's candy
that could be potentially melted places
itself that's my final offer this is
what I didn't want to see on their faces
you all did a very good job yes they
were all great they were all wonderful
it's just one was more wonderful just
read it quickly this close this close
this close enough feeling really
uncomfortable right now
alright so ltte final score twenty one
point six vs mods final score twenty
four point four all right oh yes
gentlemen goodbye good work partner to
Joe and a huge shout out to synergy
whose awesome shirt I totally destroyed
with brown paint throughout this whole
ordeal we're gonna have a demo in a
second showing you how synergy works but
basically it lets you share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
even if they run Windows Mac OS or Linux
operating systems pretty freakin cool at
huge thank you to our guest judges Riley
from NCIX
tech tips who got Steven from gamers
Nexus and Justine from well iJustine but
I'm not Justine she's Justine you guys
get the point you can check out all of
them at the links in the video
description so it didn't go the way we
wanted but sometimes that's how the
chocolate melts or whatever wait oh
that's that's ours okay well I guess
I'll read this to you candy is sweet but
not as sweet as victory and now you have
both congratulations you guys are on
post for your stupid pictures RSA you
aim for sugar but ended with salt in a
room full of candy you're the only thing
bigger that's not very nice - very true
though thank you so here's how it works
once you've got synergy set up all you
do is sit down at your computer see
there's my mouse move it around Oh
what's this I've got Linus's MacBook
over here on the left so I just moved
the cursor over there and boom I type in
some awesome website.com and I'm using
the computer as though this is connected
to it
but it's not and I've got something
really exciting for you guys synergy -
is coming it's got all the same features
as the original synergy so copy pasting
between the computers dragging and
dropping files between the computers the
ability to use it on Windows Mac and
even Linux and some new stuff they've
got a super simple redesign setup so
literally anyone can use it no typing in
IP addresses rigmarole they've got
bi-directional control coming so that
they can automate the client and server
technology so you can control either
machine with either keyboard and mouse
which is pretty frickin sick and this is
actually my favorite stuff they've got
the ability to run it as a service in
the background so it all
always is running even when you restart
and location awareness so you could have
synergy set up at work and at home and
all you do is plug down your laptop next
to your home machine pick it up take it
to work plug it down next to your work
machine and boom you are sharing your
keyboard and mouse automatically Wow so
that's gonna be coming sometime in
