of if not the best air cooler on the
market this is a six heat pipe
duel tower cooler that includes a 140
millimeter fan in the center between the
two towers a 120 millimeter fan on the
outside of one of the towers and then it
should you so desire I believe you can
actually install an additional 120
millimeter fan on the other tower so
this isn't a push-pull contraption push
pull push configuration this one's doing
pushing and pulling through radiator or
heatsink fins and down here make contact
with the CPU somewhere in there you can
see that they've cleverly designed the
height to be just barely acceptable for
high high profile memory modules such as
the muskan red lines that I am using
here today all right so I have for the
longest time wanted to test this CPU
heatsink against this CPU liquid cooling
unit so this is the Corsair H 70 is a -
density high thickness single 120
millimeter radiator liquid cooling
system so I can tell you guys right now
any thin low profile radiators system
such as a Kula dqo or an H 50 is going
to get smoked by this bad boy I mean
it's fairly simple science at this point
more surface area far less surface area
for the for the thin profile radiator
liquid cooling units so that's that
ain't going to happen for them but the h
7e might stand a chance so what I'm
going to be doing today is I'm going to
take the H well first I'm going to test
the NHD 14 on my four point seven
gigahertz core i7 2608 this is with fair
/ fair bit of over voltage so we've got
a fair bit of heat to dissipate here I'm
going to first test the NHD 14 and its
stock configuration then I'm going to
take this one 20 mil fan another NFP 12
I believe it is a 1300 or whatever it's
called the the one 1300 rpm pressure
fans so the one with the blades like
that not the other one and I'm going to
install two of those on the H 70 and see
how it performs compared to the NHD 14
I'm very excited about this because the
H 70 is the highest performance single
120 millimeter liquid cooling prefilled
unit and the NHD 14 as I mentioned
before is one of the highest performing
air coolers on the market so let's see
which one wins this heavy weight tilt so
here I am running eight instances of
prime95 on my core i7 2614 purger is 74
degrees in the minimum one is 68 so
we're going to call it sort of somewhere
in that 68 to 75 now 68 to 75 degree
range on the NHD 14 so I just put the H
70 with the two knocked with hands onto
the CPU you can see temperatures are a
touch higher already and you have to
note that unlike an air cooler where the
heat pipes basically reach their maximum
temperature heat carrying efficiency etc
right off the bat a liquid cooling unit
actually takes a while to reach
equilibrium where the liquid inside has
to heat up to the point where it
increases the efficiency with which the
radiator can exchange the heat between
the water and the air and the higher the
temperature the liquid inside the more
heat is able to be exchanged until it
reaches a point where it no longer
continues to rise with a constant heat
load so I'm going to give it some time
to see how high it goes but I think we
can already see that the D 14 comes out
ahead with the same fans
alright well looks like we've settled
into a max temperature here 88 degrees
on the highest court 81 degrees on the
lowest core running prime95 eight
instances of small FFT and thank you for
checking out my video of the NHD 14
versus the Corsair H 70 don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from our
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos yeah that's pretty much it don't
