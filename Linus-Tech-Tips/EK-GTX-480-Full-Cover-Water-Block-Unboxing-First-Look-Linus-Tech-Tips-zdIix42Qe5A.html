that I purchased for myself this is an
EK gtx 480 full of cover block that's
and acrylic nickel version so let's go
ahead and break the seals on this guy so
this is for the system upgrade that I've
been well pad in progress for quite some
time so I just have a quick disconnect
fitting in my system right now bridging
my cpu and my radiator but what i'll be
doing is i'll be putting this graphics
card in between and then not plumbing it
in so this is an msi gtx 480 card that
will be going along with the rest of my
system so it comes in an orange box and
also comes with some accessories so the
first thing we're going to find inside
are some thermal pads it's important to
use a good quality thermal pad when
you're installing any kind of
aftermarket cooler on your graphics card
because if you use a lousy one it might
not make contact which may not have any
noticeable negative effects right away
but it could dramatically shorten the
lifespan of the cart it comes with two
stalkers which are out looks like
they've changed the style of their
Stoppers they used to not have an allen
key they were actually had like a top
that you love you close with a wrench
instead but it looks like they're using
a different style now they've got Oh
rings to go with some spacers so if you
have Barb's or compression fittings with
long threads you can use these spacers
in order to make sure that they don't
hit the stopper on the other side if you
have a block that you've run into this
before with you'll know what I mean they
have also a washer here as well as a
little spacer for it looks like it goes
around the GPU as well as screws that go
into the back of the GPU to keep the
block on on the back you also get a
black and white instruction sheet that
shows you how to install the Block on
your part and that little reminder don't
forget other ek products for your water
cooling system okay and then we have the
nickel
plated lock itself very dramatic looking
very heavy very very nice I've always
been a big admirer of eks will cover
blocks they're my personal favorite with
coolants coming in as a close second I
mean just the finish on these is mirror
like in quality as you can clearly see
it's very very very reflective surface
and the thing about the nickel plating
is that it is non-oxidizing if you get a
copper block yeah you might like the
look of the copper block but I guarantee
you if I touched it like this and then
left it for six months it would have a
disgusting fingerprint that you can only
remove by polishing it so that means if
you like touch your block or you take it
apart to clean it and accidentally leave
a fingerprint in it the only way to get
it off is to take like a toothbrush and
some brass oh and like clean the heck
out of it and then and then like polish
it and it's a lot of work nickel looks
nice stays looking nice so it's that
simple so I'm going to go ahead and
install this on the card I'll probably
do a little guide about that but I want
you coming close and get some product
shots of the FC 480 GTX and hopefully
this will allow me to keep that card
nice and cool nice and quiet while I
know it will allow me to keep it cool
and quiet but there you go here's all
the machine surfaces on the back so
these are going to make contact with the
ramp this is for the GPU itself i'll use
thermal paste here and then pads on the
rest of it this is for something else
and then this is for the VRMs thank you
