second major product launch from Nick
seus this is their fusion XS which is an
update to their original network media
player and this one is an HD network
media player well okay actually hold on
the last one was HD to this one watches
movies search the web and supports full
HD 1080p so out of those three things
the most important differentiating
factor is that this one has a web
browser not only does it have a web
browser but it is also featuring android
2.2 froyo so yes it has support for any
particular Android app you could want I
believe it comes pre-loaded with
Facebook YouTube a number of other apps
and you have the flexibility to go ahead
and install other apps that you should
so desire so to go along with the web
browser you can install other apps what
else do we have to does it have to say
for itself it features the Marvel Armada
1000 chipset so it has a much more
powerful chipset than the original mix
cious media player and running okay the
updated OS we've kind of covered that
already there is an optional Wi-Fi
adapter that you can get for it and
Android OS provides users with an open
platform supporting apps gains an
abundant amount of file formats oh yes
Nick seus is allowing basically in
essence allowing their device to be
completely hacked so to speak so you can
develop open source apps or you can
download open source apps for your media
player and enjoy whatever it is that
they do so here we are for the processor
we've got a 900 megahertz Marvel process
or we've got 512 megs of ram with 1 Giga
flash on board this we've covered
already video output is hdmi 1.3 so no
we're not going to have 3d output but I
suspect most people are streaming 3d
over their networks just yet anyway
audio output is via HDMI you can also do
stereo audio output you've got wired ten
hundred Ethernet and why don't we go
ahead and get this baby opened up inside
the box we find a fairly simple fairly
eco-friendly package so we've got a
little bit of foam here but other than
that they've gone with the
cardboard approach oh it's very small
this is actually one of the smaller
network media players that I've seen
what that does tell me right away though
is that it does not support an internal
hard drive but I do know that it
supports an external hard drive so if
you want to plug in a hard drive via USB
that is an option for you this is one of
the more robust looking remotes that
I've seen on one of these network media
player boxes although the price is a
little bit higher than some of its
competitors comes with a couple triple-a
batteries and we've got our forward and
back or up and down this is most of our
navigation we've got our confirm button
we've got all of our numbers that we
could want and pretty much all the
basics seem to be here much about
actually kind of slick this looks like a
breakout cable yep so the breakout from
your standard headphone jack e looking
cable to kompis it just in case you have
an older TV you want to use it with just
come with a network cable and finally it
comes with a power adapter which looks a
little something like this there you go
in terms of documentation we've got our
warranty information which probably a
year would be my guess oh yeah two year
warranty it's a two year warranty on the
power supply as well that's actually not
bad at all normally I would expect from
a smaller company like Nick seus them to
have like a sort of a one-year
bare-bones warranty but they're going
the sort of back it up and yes support
the product for a longer term route
interesting so here's a quick set-up
guide which should be fairly
straightforward if you've ever hooked up
a network media player before just want
to make sure that you have your your
network shares and you're accessing them
using a network media player pretty
self-explanatory I think let's have a
look at the unit itself so it's fairly
slick actually it's got kind of a curved
shape to the front I'll let you see that
from the side so you can get a better
idea of how that looks yeah there you go
you can see that and then on the side
kind of the same deal on the back that's
where all of the businesses so we've got
an on/off switch there's a V so that's
that composite output of also got
optical audio out and
GMI including hdmi audio out two USB
ports that's actually nice to see more
than one USB port we've got ten hundred
Ethernet and our power in on the bottom
of the unit you can see its metals
construction here so that should help
with cooling a little bit although I'm
guessing it runs pretty cool because
there's not a whole lot of ventilation
on it there's gaps here and here and
then there's what appears to be sort of
a passive intake right here four rubber
feet keep it from slipping around once
you put it on its table and I want you
guys to stay tuned on not this channel
but my NCIX comm channel because we're
actually going to be taking a look this
is the first Android network media
player that I've seen so we're going to
check out how that looks in a real world
scenario so thank you for checking out
