g 302 dateless prime mobile gaming mouse
Linus was going to review it but seasons
changed time passed by the weeks became
the months became the Linus forgotten so
a very short introduction to the
Logitech G 302 day list prime and a more
full review of the new G 303 dadless
apex two mice that you might think look
the same and well you'd be right but
there are a few differences probably
you'll find out after the intro
so the idea behind the G 302 was to
build a mouse that was ideal for dota
and the lesser game League of Legends
small and lightweight so you don't get
fatigued moving your mouse back and
forth with a very fast click to the
minimized mouse mouth I meant mouse
button travel distance and Logitech
achieve that twice now I guess because
the G 303 Daedalus apex is here it
weighs a mere 87 grams without the cable
about the same as the abysus or G 100's
pre weight mod but it's not as light as
the final mass 2015 74 grams the shape
is a bit unusual and it's a lover hated
characteristic the front and back tapers
off pretty sharply and the angular back
in middle leaves you with less contact
surface than other mice if you have big
hands you might find yourself a bit
cramped but if you have small hands the
sharp angles might cause some soreness
keep in mind while this mouse has a
symmetrical shape it is not ambidextrous
this is a right-handed Mouse for
right-handed people who primarily use a
fingertip or claw grip as for the rest
of the physical overview in spite of its
featherweight class the G 303's build
quality feels solid with none of the
creaky plastic feel that is common on
lesser mice there's a left and right
mouse button in their expected positions
logitech's been doing this a while so it
would be hard for them to screw that up
what they haven't been doing for a while
is what logitech calls a metal spring
button tensioning system which reduces
pre-travel while a lot of high
performance mice have a left right mouse
button as part of the top shell the
Daedalus has dedicated floating buttons
which overall results in a very quick
and light click that is pretty
consistent regardless of where pressure
is applied to the button although it's
not so light that you accidentally shoot
or stab teammates and spawn on Death
Adder the scroll wheel has distinct
notches that you can feel and offers
only light resistance to actually
rolling it this is good if you want to
zoom in
out really quickly but it does make very
precise scroll actuations hard to
achieve quickly pressing the scroll
wheel is unfortunately affected by the
light rolling resistance sometimes when
I press down on the scroll wheel I'm
liable to scroll up or down while I'm at
it right below it is a dpi switch and
finally two thumb buttons on the left
side the thumb buttons have a short
actuation although it does feel mushy
once you do pass the actuation which is
kind of disappointing after you feel the
left and right mouse clicks that are
just amazing so what is this mouse it
seems a lot like the g3 oh - well the g3
oh - Daedalus prime MOBA gaming mouse is
for MOBA players as the name implies and
the g3 o3 is for shooting people in the
face but how do you take the same shell
and optimize it for a different game
type when you play an FPS especially
Counter Strike global Offensive you have
to make rather large mass movements
since you're probably using a low dpi
for that extra accuracy and I found that
the rubber cable was a bit too
inflexible and would give a small but
annoying bit of resistance when I would
move up or down and get close to my mass
Bungie at high speeds like with flick
shots I found that the G 302 was liable
to lean to one side or another
losing tracking as it only had mass feed
at the top center and bottom the cloud9
csgo team apparently loved the weight
and shape of the G 302 well except for
nothing
who still preferred the G 100's and
where it has it that team solomid CS
Team loved it too unfortunately the amo
10 sensor wasn't enough with a maximum
tracking speed of about 120 inches per
second or 3 meters per second it just
couldn't keep up I know my flick shot
regularly hits 4 meters per second and I
don't I can't even imagine like cloud
nine with hit probably higher they get
paid for it
well Logitech was listening and took
this feedback from pro gamers and
enthusiasts which resulted in the new G
303 it looks and feels like the G 302
with some tweaks for competitive FPS
play the rubber cable was changed to a
soft braided
Abell and it seems flexible and durable
enough it's a bit thicker and heavier
than the cable on the Roccat Kone pure
military so sometimes I do find it
dragging while the KPM cable stays off
my best pad on the bottom they've added
two mouse feet on the sides to give it a
bit more stability when making
high-speed movements finally and most
importantly they swapped out the AM 0/10
sensor and replaced it with a BMW 3366
sensor previously only seen in
Logitech's flagship g502 making the G
303 capable of tracking at speeds in
excess of 300 inches per second or 7.6
m/s more than double the amo 10 and the
g3 o to double the 3310 sensor found in
top gaming mice like the rival or
counter military and even more from the
DeathAdder chroma in my test I don't
know if it can do seven point six meters
per second but at the six that I would
reach at the very fastest it did handle
that perfectly the G 302 was rate for
MOBAs now the G 303 is also perfect for
FPS I'll be it at a higher price point
of $69.99 is it worth the upgrade from
the G 302 if you find your cable gets in
the way or you can't really do your
noscope 360s because it just doesn't
keep up
well the G 303 is an upgrade but as with
all mice comfort is important and if the
odd shape of the Daedalus doesn't fit
and it doesn't fit so the G 303 is a
small lightweight mouse with a flagship
sensor that pretty much beats out every
other sensor the left and right click
action is fantastic and now with the
flexible cable it won't get in the way
of your flick shots the shape might
offend some but if you can handle it the
G 303 is definitely a mouse ready for
eSports Oh No why just kill me speaking
of whatever ensel was just talking about
