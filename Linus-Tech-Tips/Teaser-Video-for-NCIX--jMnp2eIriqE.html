actually had any number of people
request a new yes I got a copy of vegas
i will no longer be using Windows Live
Movie Maker the cameraman finds that
very amusing evidently okay I am going
to be doing a remake of the good enough
gaming system which I this original
video was released on the NCI ex-con
channel in standard death got about a
hundred thousand views in on august
twenty-third 2007 it dates to your left
there yeah okay so I have gotten a ton
of requests to redo this with more
modern hardware so I've actually decided
not only to do that but also to kick
things up a notch and I'm going to be
doing two systems so I'm going to do one
with my original good enough gaming goal
which was a six-hundred-dollar system so
let's walk you through what I'm going to
be using for that this is all stuff that
I've shopped for on the NCIX site and
our weekly special this week so no
guarantees you'll find exactly this deal
but there are no that's there for a
reason what are you dad what do you say
Mickey team that's there for a reason
okay um so uh now I've completely lost
my train of thought right so you usually
find deals of this caliber although you
might not find exactly the same one so
the first thing I've got here for my
good enough gaming system is a core i3
2100 processor with a gigabyte h61
motherboard I went super valu low-end on
the motherboard and for the processor
I've gone with a dual core because the
reality of it is most of the games out
there are still going to run just fine
on a dual core i went with four gigs of
ram because for thirty nine ninety nine
minus a five-dollar mir how can you say
no the gtx 460 one gig especially with
an additional 25 bucks off with a
mail-in rebate and a free copy of hawks
two and a free NCIX ten dollar gift card
that comes with it is a smoking good
deal so that works out to just under 150
bucks for a great gaming graphics card
the 300 at 50 to 99 minus a 20 mir is a
well ventilated gaming chassis it's
pretty you know basic but it is what it
is we're trying to hit a price point
here I
do not have enough budget for an SSD so
I've gone with a forty dollar western
digital caviar blue 500 gig I did not go
with a green even though they're cheap
because green drives are not really
suitable for OS drive use I have a DVD
writer I've gone with windows 7 home
premium and a true power new 650 watt
power supply normally this would not fit
in my budget for a six-hundred-dollar
machine but it has a 30-dollar mir on it
so down here at the bottom I can see
that my cart total is 693 dollars and
ninety two cents I have eighty dollars
in mi RS and I have a ten-dollar NCIX
gift card that comes with that venomous
I graphics card so I basically treat
that as cash so I went just over my six
hundred dollar target and if you know
someone if you already have a copy of
windows seven then you can save yourself
a hundred bucks Barry becomes a
five-hundred-dollar gaming machine now
for comparison I want to take this value
gaming machine and put it up against
what you can build for about a thousand
bucks so here we've got an i5 2500 k so
we've gone from a dual-core to a
quad-core processor we've gone from the
tipo h61 board to a p67 board that is
sli ready crossfirex ready and capable
overclocking we've gone from four gigs
to eight gigs of RAM we've gone all the
way up to a gtx 570 OC we've upgraded
the chassis because most people you see
spending a thousand bucks on a gaming
system are going to be buying a decent
chassis the 932 is definitely a very
decent chassis especially for after a
twenty-dollar mir around a hundred bucks
we've gone with the same power supply
because it's such a good deal at four
thirty nine ninety nine the true power
650 is just a ridiculous deal so is
fully capable of supporting that gtx 570
so that's what i'll be doing I can't
afford an SSD on this machine so I'm
going with an ocz vertex to 60 gig and
then I'm going to go with the caviar
green for storage because you can cheap
out on the drive because it's just for
storage green is fine for that finally
I've got a DVD writer same as the other
one in Windows Home some windows 7 home
premium for a hundred bucks and so my
total minus a hundred and ten dollars of
Mir comes to about twelve fifty three
minus one hundred and ten minus another
ten bucks so ah just over eleven hundred
dollars so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to build both of these machines
for you guys and I'm going to compare
our good enough gaming machine to what
you would get if you spend just under
twice as much don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips from unboxings and
computer videos and don't forget to
