some context for previous na B's black
magic has managed to steal the show for
the past four years with their camera
announcements naturally this year was no
different with the announcement of the
Ursa mini which is poised to be one of
the most interesting cameras announced
at NAB 2015 this year let's check it out
Linus tech tips coverage of NAB 2015 is
powered by Sennheiser Kingston and Linda
calm fearsome mini seems to be the
result of black magic finally taking
feedback from real-world shooters and
making a camera that is finally
reasonably economic starting with the
specs the Ursa mini now sports two main
sensor options the older 4k sensor from
last year's Blackmagic Ursa release as
well as a brand-new impressive 4.6 k
sensor that claims 15 stops of dynamic
range one of the most interesting things
about the sensor is that it has both a
rolling and global shutter with the
ability to shoot up to 30 FPS with the
global shutter and 60 FPS with the
rolling shutter at 4.6 k resolution if
you are not need of the 4.6 k resolution
the camera will also shoot up to 160 FPS
in regular 1080p moving on to the
physical features of the camera you can
get it with either a Canon EF or a
cinema standard PL mount the air simony
is also sporting a large 5-inch
touchscreen that nearly makes up one
side of the camera however if you do not
want to use it there's also buttons on
the exterior of the monitor for easy
access to controls like custom function
keys and record for recording media
black magic has chosen the new C fast to
point no standard of cards which at the
moment are quite pricey but with more
cameras this year adapting the format I
am hopeful that the cost will come down
soon the eris minee also comes with a
surprisingly solid remote hand grip that
allows you to start and stop recording
as well as map other custom features to
the other two buttons on the controller
the evf attached is a 1500 roll optional
accessory that was actually surprisingly
impressive it's a 1920 x 1080 oled
display that produced a very crisp image
likely to be my favorite new feature of
this camera is the two built-in XLR
ports in the top that are easily
adjusted with the audio dials on the
side of the camera in camera audio is a
simple feature but very few cameras at
this level do it well and with the
addition of the built-in microphone at
the front to complement the XLR s the
air simony finally looks like a camera
that you can take out of the box and
just start shooting with lastly in terms
of the rest of the IO on the camera it
has to SDI out reference in time code in
a 4-pin XLR power out with a 12 volt
main power in a land sea controller for
the remote hand grip and a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack for monitoring
audio with all these impressive specs
and features black magic has managed to
price the earth simony at a very
competitive 4995 dollars for the 4.6 k
version with an additional five hundred
dollars for the PL mount version and
having the older sensor version coming
at even lower prices than that as
someone who's been using black magic
cameras for the last two years I'm
excited to see black magic truly take
the first steps to a well-rounded
production camera that could suit many
shooting situations that their previous
cameras may not have been perfect for
