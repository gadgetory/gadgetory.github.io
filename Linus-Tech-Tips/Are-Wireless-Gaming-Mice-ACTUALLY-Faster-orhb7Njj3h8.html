and Corsair recently joined them that
their Wireless gaming mice are
indistinguishable from their wired ones
because they've managed to get the
processing latency so low that either
one is less than one millisecond the
fastest poling or sample rate that's
available over the USB connection and
like that's pretty cool no cord dragging
on your mouse hand has obvious benefits
for gamers but the thing is is that
we've mostly taken Logitech's word for
it up until now because we've never had
any of the equipment that we would need
to validate their claims well no more so
we recently rented a phantom 4k
high-speed camera from Kaslow camera for
our recent collaboration with gap from
slo-mo guys and we figured what the hey
we've already got it we might as well
use it
whoo that's hot speaking of hot this
segue to our sponsor for today's video
story blocks video story blocks offers
you studio quality stock video clips for
a fraction of the cost
check it out today at the link in the
video description
admittedly we haven't devised a way to
intercept the signal from the mouse
before it ever gets to the operating
system video card driver game engine and
finally your display so we aren't going
to be able to address claims from brands
like Logitech and Corsair about their
mice achieving sub 1 millisecond
transmission speeds what we can do
however is determine whether any of the
mice that we're looking at today
including both wired and wireless models
are faster or slower in a way that could
possibly be meaningful to gamers because
here's the thing our perception of mouse
leg or Mouse latency is dictated by the
total delay that we feel between moving
our hands and seeing the corresponding
action on the screen so as long as we
can ensure consistency in all of our
other variables any difference that we
observe from one Mouse to the next comes
down to the signal transmission time
whether it's along a wire or whether
it's wirelessly to a dongle let's have a
look at our test right here
we're running competitive shooter csgo
on this Corsair Vengeance gaming rig
with a core i7 8,700 and geforce r-tx
2080 we've paired this with one of the
fastest gaming monitors around this
1080p 240 Hertz one from Acer to record
each run and measure our total Mouse to
screen latency we're using a phantom
flex 4k from vision research at 4k 1000
frames per second so that means every
frame here is just one millisecond now
you might think that to get a precise
measurement for each Mouse we could just
move the mouse around with our arms and
then count the frame delay but not so at
a thousand frames per second any organic
body is gonna have too much give to get
a clear start point so we had to get a
little bit more creative meat norm so
named for its - naught or gates with
Alex's creation here we can swing a
hammer at the mouse and with these
conductive surfaces on the backs of our
mice and on the tip of our hammer we can
record the exact moment of contact with
the indicator LED that's on this
breadboard here that removes the
reliability of our measurements
dramatically and it's pretty fun to do
for our first round of testing we're
gonna keep things simple we're gonna
take one of logitech's high-performance
wired mice so this is their new
generation mx518 with their hero sensor
and we're gonna put it head-to-head
against one of their high performance
wireless mice in this case the G 703 so
we're gonna do the wired one first
because the conventional wisdom would go
that that's your that's your baseline
right first round mx518 fantastic wow
that's a really short delay
our first run with the mx518 taught us a
couple of things number one is that we
could expect with a wired mouse anyway
about 15 milliseconds of latency
according to our measurements and that
we could expect a high degree of
consistency one other key takeaway was
that the creation of the apparatus to
light up the LED when the hammer hits
the back of the mouse was entirely
unnecessary as it turns out using
different mode and premiere to examine
two frames we could more easily identify
the true starting point for our mouse
movement I am fascinated by this test we
really have to get the actual
milliseconds this is really interesting
that seems like a really big distance
before it actually registers that
doesn't seem right we're not making the
rules here it is what it is now one
special thing that we're making sure to
do here is we're putting the dongle
right here above the table to ensure
that it's not subject to any unfair
interference first wireless mouse test
here we go with the G 703 Wireless we
weren't quite sure what to expect
Logitech claims the performance should
be basically the same but our common
sense tells us that it couldn't possibly
be especially with respect to
performance consistency because Wireless
is far more susceptible to interference
than a wired connection well as it turns
out within the margin of error of our
experiment they were the same wow that
actually looks faster but might just be
crazy
so there you have it guys not only did
we learn that our wireless mouse
performed the same as our wired mouse
within the margin of error of our
experiment we also saw that they both
performed incredibly consistently from
one run to the next but since we've got
the rig setup anyway we figured why not
investigate some other manufacturers
mice so we're gonna start with Corsairs
dark or RGB se we chose this one because
it's Corsairs
sort of equivalent sub 1 millisecond
latency Mouse and we wanted to know how
their claims stack up Corsairs dark or
RGB SC was an interesting one for us it
was still within the margin of error of
our experiment just as fast as both of
the Logitech mice but when we averaged
our results it did measure a little bit
slower the next thing we wanted to find
out on our voyage of discovery today was
whether it actually matters if a mouse
can be sent to a thousand Hertz polling
rate so the final Mouse ultralight
sunset has a bit of a bad reputation for
being capped out at 500 Hertz does it
matter
only one way to know it actually tied
for the lowest single response time but
compared to the Logitech mice it was
less consistent could this be due to the
500 Hertz pulling rate until we have a
thousand Hertz monitor it'll be hard for
us to tell we're not done yet though for
our last test we pulled out a Logitech
MX anywhere 2 Mouse this is by no means
a piece of gaming equipment but it gives
us a great point of comparison for all
the high performance gaming mice that
we've looked at so far well this was a
great lesson for gamers everywhere if
you want to have the best most
responsive experience you're gonna want
to choose a gaming mouse it was over
double the average response time of all
of our gaming grade mice and making
matters worse that's with Logitech's 2.4
gigahertz wireless connection rather
than bluetooth which introduces even
further latency and more interference
the final nail in its coffin for gaming
is that the sudden acceleration from our
hammer kick would cause the sensor in
some cases to lose tracking and behave
erratically so the conclusion here is
pretty straightforward
while I want to again acknowledge that
we weren't able to test all the way down
to one millisecond
what we can take away from our
experiment is that at least for Logitech
we have validated their position that
anyone who claims to be able to tell the
difference between their wired and
wireless mice is either imagining it or
foolish but okay I tell you what I will
I will guess this one as faster I'll say
this one's wired Oh that's the wired
mouse uh-oh that's bad okay in fairness
to me those mice had slightly different
cables on them and that was probably
what I was picking up on now a secondary
observation here is that Corsairs
Wireless appears at least within the
margin of error of our test to be on par
with Logitech's
though it is notable that our average
results were slightly worse
our next conclusion is that anyone
claiming to be able to tell the
difference between 500 Hertz and 1000
Hertz polling rates on a
high-performance Mouse is also imagining
it even if you were capable of feeling a
two millisecond difference in
responsiveness your monitor because you
don't have more than a 240 Hertz display
would not be able to display it finally
do gaming mice have a value absolutely
not only did our MX anywhere 2 which to
be clear isn't even a terrible Mouse and
we weren't even using with Bluetooth
have measurably higher latency thanks at
least partially to its 125 Hertz polling
rate it also didn't track as well or as
consistently perhaps thanks to its less
sophisticated sensor or its power saving
