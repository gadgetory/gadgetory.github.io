console successor to the Wii U but it's
also a powerful and interesting portable
handheld device or you can put it down
on a table if you'd prefer it's actually
really cool with that said evaluating it
wasn't an easy task for me sometimes
with reviews of things that I really
like I'm hard on them out of love and
with the switch you'll see some of that
because I do love it but you'll also see
some criticism that comes from a
different place all together my time
with the switch has been a roller
coaster of emotions and persons with
these conditions probably shouldn't ride
sigh by powers line-up of gaming
desktops feature
Intel seventh generation core i7
processors check them out on Amazon at
the link below the joint con controllers
are so important to the unique
experience of gaming on a switch that
they'd literally form the logo for it
they both featured normal things
batteries that charge when they're
docked on to the console itself all of
the thumb sticks and buttons that you'd
expect other than an analog trigger then
we get into the more unique stuff they
also feature quick releases on the back
and pairing buttons between some
shoulder buttons then the right joy con
controller has an NFC reader in its
thumb stick for amiibo pairing and an IR
camera for games like eating contest
where you hold it in front of your mouth
and make eating motions quickly HD
Rumble is a cool concept and it's
definitely better than previous versions
of Rumble but I don't think it's quite
as awesome as they actually make it out
to be when playing something like ball
count in one two switch
it just gets frustrating it's not real
enough to be genuinely immersive and it
ends up being a tiresome gimmick
usability wise I'd say it ranges from an
acceptable to a bad experience when
they're mounted on the side of the
switch in handheld mode it's on the
acceptable end but not great the
joysticks being off axis which I
generally prefer having grown up on the
Xbox side of things sucks
in handheld mode because the right side
joystick being lower on the right joique
on your hand has to be positioned in a
really weird way in order to support the
weight of the console and I'm not the
only one who felt this way yeah I mean
it's a hell of a lot better than playing
on a tablet or a phone that's for sure
but I think for me the one issue is like
with my right hand if I have to switch
up and down switch I have to shift my
hand a little bit it feels kind of weird
mainly the right side of things just
because the joystick feels like it
should be there but it's there and it's
kind of weird a grip I think when
they're detached they're fine but this
is pretty weird
sorry the joy Khan they kind of like
crippled the functionality because they
wanted to have each thing be its own
controller it's just it's so twiddle e
and small I can't even deal
I think the joysticks there but we just
not balance and it's kind of hard to
hold in one side but I have no reference
so they still call the Wii U tablet
controller had both the joysticks at the
top this made sense I understand why
they did it this way on the switch but I
don't think it's justified and I'll get
to that in a moment in tabletop mode
when you have the joy Kong controllers
off the switch and are playing by
yourself it's acceptable to players in
that same scenario is pretty bad however
just due to how cramped your hands are
when you only get to use one of these
pretty tiny controllers this is also why
they have the thumbsticks
off axis because it makes it easier to
use them when they're by themselves but
as this scenario is just bad in general
it wasn't worth sacrificing the
ergonomics of using it as a handheld
then there's the grip it sucks in my
opinion especially considering
Nintendo's vast controller design
experience from the giant gap in the
middle to the lack of an actual d-pad to
the lousy mobile device grade joysticks
to the vertical alignment of all the
controls when you're trying to use it at
once
everything about it contributes to the
poor ergonomic experience which luckily
for Nintendo will likely Drive a lot of
zelda breath of the wild players to go
out and buy the switch pro controller
which and again I'm not the only one who
feels this way actually feels pretty
great and can charge over USB type-c
which is a really nice bonus it's an
awesome controller now this I like it
should come with this but one thing I
can see people missing is the linear
control triggers here but other than
that pen the ergonomics feel good the
plastics are just really solid I like
this thing
I think the pro controller feels like a
normal controller if I had a Nintendo
switch this would probably be what I use
most of the time the joy con grip just
felt kind of awkward and that's just
taffy it's got a good feel to it
everything's on the right spot
but all the buttons are easy to reach
yeah pretty nope I said I can get to
each buttons and this thing very easily
like you can do whatever like it's all
in here this is a lot more normal thanks
gendo for giving us options
okay let's talk gaming experience now
handheld mode first you get about two
and a half hours of play in something
like breath of the wild without any
charging but Nintendo's decision to go
with USB type-c instead of their own
proprietary power connector makes it
really easy to charge up on the go I
love this decision Thank You Nintendo it
wakes up from sleep super fast getting
you into the game almost instantly and
it doesn't weigh that much at 0.88
pounds does it replace something like a
3ds not for everyone but for battery
bank warriors like me maybe yeah next up
is tabletop mode so about the kind of
weaksauce feeling kickstand prop it on
the airplane tray or table in the
lunchroom and boom you're gaming it's
really that easy and it's really cool
and makes the consoles that much more
versatile Nintendo seems to have
overlooked to the importance of be able
to run off of wall power in this mode
however maybe there's a 3d printing
solution to this problem but most other
aspects of it are well thought out if
you apply too much pressure to the stand
it just pops out rather than breaking
and you can put it back on which is nice
but before we do that now is a great
time to check out the more standard non
proprietary IO who are you and what have
you done with Nintendo this is so weird
but awesome there's an SD card slot
under the kickstand and this is a huge
step forward in mobility allowing you to
pack games onto it to avoid carrying
around game carts when the on-board
storage overflows now and I understand
if you've forgotten by this point as
we've only talked about the mobile
experience but the switch is a living
room console so if you want to use it as
one you throw it onto a dock that
charges and powers the switch gives you
HDMI output to
your TV or something like a monitor it
provides three USB connections for
accessories like Ethernet adapters and
charging for the pro controller that I
consider basically a necessary add-on
it's pretty much a glorified USB hub you
will still be using the power button
volume buttons game card slot and
headphone jack from the top of the
switch console itself and I'll save you
the trouble of trying it none of the
off-brand USB C hubs that I tried worked
and I tried a lot of them TV mode was a
mixed bag for me 4k TVs are becoming
quite popular and outputting 720p on a
4k display in 2017 feels like a pretty
heavy compromise and this comes from
someone who fully understands that the
Nintendo gaming experience is about
gameplay not graphics and there are
style makes up for it a lot I just can't
help but notice that the performance
hasn't really come very far since the
Wii U and I also understand how it
happened mobile performance for them is
fantastic just having a high quality
upscaler in the dock would have been
deeply appreciated and while we're at it
a working Virtual Console and Bluetooth
headset connectivity would have appeased
retro nerds like me and wireless
headphone enthusiasts like Apple I guess
in conclusion the switch is a very
interesting idea like the Nvidia shield
tablet but with the expectation that
I'll get a killer game library with it
this is a potentially great direction
for Nintendo to go in but I feel like
some decisions along the way with the
joy Kahn controllers and the dock should
have been switched up a little I feel
like they couldn't decide if they wanted
to replace the 3d S or not and
consequently ended up uncomfortably
somewhere in between then on the subject
of the game library there's the issue of
one two switch it's like Wii Sports in
the sense that it's good wholesome
family fun with minigames that gets
everyone into the swing of using the new
controller style except unlike Wii
Sports it doesn't come with the console
it's a full-priced
half-assed game you'll have fun with
some of the games like sword fight
quick-draw samurai training and milk but
many of its games feel like near clones
of each other and I believe the right
move was to put it in the box with the
console breath of the wild on the other
hand if you have a Wii U and you don't
plan on getting a switch by it if you're
getting a switch by it if you have
neither of those options find a friend
that has one of those options and go to
their house a lot it will be worth it
but back on topic is the switch worth it
I'm not really comfortable giving an
unconditional recommendation giving the
current state of its games library but
man it's a really unique piece of
hardware that's what Nintendo does best
and as a die-hard Nintendo fanboy I'm
going to go for it and I'm really
excited thanks for watching guys is this
video sucked you know what to do
who's awesome get subscribed hit the
like button check out the links down
below where you can see where to buy
some of the stuff including the pretty
much required pro controller and breath
of the wild because you're buying a
switch you should probably get both of
those also you can see where to buy a
shirt which is hopefully being like
video editors on top of the shirt that
I'm currently wearing I actually took my
work shirt home and this was like a
Nintendo inspired shirt I thought it
would find but it's not fine for this
part of video I'm rambling for way too
