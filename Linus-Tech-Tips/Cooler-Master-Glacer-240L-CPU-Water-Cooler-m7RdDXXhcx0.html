I have only good things to say about
this is the glacier 240 L liquid CPU
cooler from coolermaster it was designed
in collaboration with my favorite DIY
liquid cooling brand swift Tec and
you're gonna see an awful lot of swift
Tec DNA in this particular product so
first is some eco-friendly packaging
with some foam that I actually don't
remember where it went I accidentally
took it out last time we were trying to
do the unboxing but I screwed up that
shot next up we find the installation
guide then we find the fully assembled
guys this is a prefilled
ready to rock liquid cooling unit unit
and then some assembly hardware so
you've got some cooler master thermal
paste you've got some mounting brackets
that are made out a nice solid steel
extremely robust and you've got swift
Tex I believe excellent mounting
hardware while there are a lot of pieces
swift Tec does a great job of ensuring
that the mounting clamping force the
pressure on the CPU socket is correct
and within the manufacturer's
specifications next up we find the
radiator and fan unit itself which is
wrapped in a protective bubble wrap to
keep it from being damaged in transit
we'll start with the radiator reservoir
combo unit so on the top here we find a
fill port plug which you can keep closed
if you're not planning to expand the
system or swap out the coolant in it for
whatever reason and then we find the
first cooler master
addition to the product these are their
Blademaster fans designed for static
pressure as opposed to free-flowing
airflow which is great because they're
on a nice fat radiator we also find an
extremely heavy and robustly built
radiator with full copper brass
construction no aluminum even on the
fins what that means is simply better
performance per sort of surface area
compared to other products on the market
and compatibility really hasn't been
affected much by all of this robustness
although you will need a little bit more
space than you do for your typical
radiator because the tank on the
is a little bit longer than normal to
account for that reservoir and that fill
port and then on the other side you have
your typical clearance required for
fittings speaking of fittings
Coolermaster includes 3/8 inch elbow
fittings that can actually fully rotate
it so if you wanted to mount the unit
fully the other way you could definitely
go ahead and do that and they can
actually have the nice little custom
clamps that are holding the tubing on
removed so you can swap out different
tubing should you see fit whether it's
for aesthetic reasons or whether you
want to expand the system to add a
graphics card water block or something
like that down the line it's fully
expandable and customizable and you can
even add more radiators and all kinds of
cool crazy stuff like that one of the
reasons that this one will actually
perform a little bit better than Swift
Tech's own version of it is the fact
that cooler master has gone with a
higher rpm on the pump so that leads us
to the pump and CPU block combo unit
here which has a nice little cooler
master badge on the top of it here with
brushed accents so then most of the
magic is actually hidden away here so
that pump I talked about before is built
into the CPU block unit which is capped
with an excellent again swift Tec
designed micro fin water block that has
a copper base plate that is finished to
a beautiful beautiful shine although it
comes with some tape that we're going to
leave on until we do our performance
testing just to make sure that it is as
clean as possible make sure you don't
install it with that please there's also
one mounting bracket pre-installed so if
you're going to be installing on most
Intel sockets
you're going to be ready to rock just by
unscrewing the four screws that are
pre-installed on it throwing that
backplate on
and screwing it on to your motherboard
socket then that leads us to the
fittings that are built into the CPU
block unit which are again rotating
fittings giving you a lot of flexibility
in terms of where you mount your
radiator and where you mount your tubing
as well as those same removable clamps
so you can swap out the tubing for
something else should you see fit the
last thing here that I want to show you
guys is how the power works so there is
a single lead for rpm monitoring as well
as PWM control that goes to your CPU
header and then power for the pump
itself is provided by a SATA power
connector I'm not a hundred percent sure
how I feel about that because normally I
wouldn't route my SATA cables towards my
CPU socket they would go to
the drive cages but the flipside of that
is you have an optical drive you could
carry another part of the harness over
there or you can just use a molex to
SATA adapter which are inexpensive
practically free and then you can run
whatever cable you want up there so it's
a quite a flexible implementation if
nothing else in our testing rig we have
a 3930k overclocked at 4.0 gigahertz
running a voltage of 1.3 volts to kick
some more heat out then we also have a
GTX 580 running a little bit overclocked
and running afterburners that it
generates some heat to and the CPU is
crunching numbers on prime95 small FFTs
we tested the cooler with its stock fans
and Noctua and ff12 s the reason why we
do this is we test all of our coolers
with Noctua and ff12 so that we have
another constant and we're not basing
the coolers on the fans necessarily but
we also test it with stock so you can
see how it will perform right out of the
box performance was pretty
straightforward and expected it slotted
basically right beside its brother the
h2 20 on both tests idle and load we
notice with its stock fans that it was
slightly worse than the NFF twelves but
still very solid performance on both of
the tests one additional observation
that I had was while this pump is 500
rpm faster I don't know if I would run
it at that unless you're doing something
like adding in a few graphics cards that
pump is quite loud and I turned it down
pretty much as much as much as I could
when you're looking into water coolers
in the comments below are you looking
more for an all-in-one that you never
have to change and would never be able
to change easily or are you looking more
into something like this cooler the 240
L where you can add graphics cards or
something to it like the video if you
liked the video dislike the video if you
dislike the video and always please
