you're not familiar with the format you
can one yes one also you can click that
question that's one this is two
basically what we do is we take a theme
and we build a computer around that
theme with a very limited budget and
very limited time and today's theme is a
future a future would be future future
so let's see what's in our future right
now yeah I think mine is similar okay
let's go
so the idea behind tech showdown is that
neither of the participants other than
the secret ingredient which is the theme
of the future knows what the other is
doing but I think based on very cryptic
conversations with Luke that we've both
taken a worst-case scenario
interpretation of the future and run
with that today and while I think on
some whoops I'm gone okay dang it
while I think it's impossible for us to
actually have come up with the same idea
he thinks the same thing so do two
impossibilities make a possibility nope
unless they do man like I don't know the
viewers are gonna be in on it the whole
time if we're building the same computer
I don't think it's impossible though all
you have got to be kidding me
I don't have my orange screwdriver kill
me now
Jake maybe he borrowed it sometimes he
borrows it he's not allowed to but he
does it anyway
success okay um so he's building his
computer already I'm actually I'm quite
a ways away from that I have some work
to do on the case before I can start on
that now last tech showdown I was
heavily reliant on something I had never
done before being executed with a
reasonable degree of skill it was almost
an entirely glitter themed PC for today
I'm going back to skills that may not be
fresh in my mind but at least I have
scissors construction paper and glue
sticks the label maker is key my friend
open Josh why is the case derping Josh I
blame you for any problems that happened
to this place this is our color palette
for the day welcome
I'm going to spell out my theme but not
actually in order
there you go that is my belief I'm gonna
reveal to the camera just because it
seems surprisingly likely that he's gone
with a similar theme
I really hope he's not also doing this
okay ah oh man I'm just kind of
scattered right now I'm gonna I gotta
get my thoughts together my my future is
so depressing that it's hard to even
execute any like it's not even really
funny the first thing we're going to
need is a striped striped color scheme
on the one side panel here because it's
all about it's all about the the
greatness the greatness of the effect of
this magnificent event and I really hope
that I bought enough construction paper
I'm really not sure I went and I
returned some of the white sheets at the
last second not realizing what colors I
would need so I need a straightedge Luke
do you have the level all right yep
that'll work now I just need a pencil I
don't even get in Oh
why is this such a piece of god
damn it why is this oh
what a way to waste time with a can of
primer that we had at work I should have
just trusted the pain I brought
do racist jokes fit into your theme
should I open it I don't have my
scissors
excuse me Joan oh my god
our measuring tape Luke can I have a
measuring tape see the advantage to
being on that side is that you actually
have easy access to most of the tools
the disadvantages that you have to hand
me the tools oh wow hey I'll show you
how I can grab things the better to grab
you with my dear
do you mean like it's not allowed
because we're both men Oh
maybe we have the same future okay oh my
goodness I have burned like 20 minutes
cutting out six stripes this is not good
I didn't even measure how many I needed
I might have cut extra Oh what am i
doing
I think I cut extra um what about them I
don't know I might have to start going a
little faster but if I'm planning to
overlap them I actually don't really
need them to be that precise at all so
I've been wasting time either way I'm
speeding up this is how it was with the
glitter I got faster just in time to not
need to do it anymore
we're gonna have what would look like a
pretty traditional Stars and Stripes
kind of arrangement here but in the
corner I'm gonna put the face of Trump
oh yeah always beautiful beautiful wait
it's red and white right okay we're just
we're gonna have to approximate it all
right here we go I'm going for gold for
my next trick I'm gonna add more glue in
retrospect I think it may have been
better to start at the bottom I mean
does this stuff set like instantly or
what holy crap I'm gonna start building
them from the bottom up I don't even
remember what color I started with
anymore I don't know when this thing is
ready gonna take that as a no how long
does it take okay I'm just gonna wait
for this to heat up and try to do
something else so careful that brain
it's gonna be very hot it's even gonna
be enough oh my god
I'm cutting my sand right now because I
need that be done first I'm just short I
don't have the corners it might be okay
because I bought this stuff so I feel
like glue in that right there
is this thing not plugged in oh my god
that's the problem
holy Sh this stupid extension cord isn't
plugged in is this supposed to make your
eyes burn
superglue all right so this is pretty
good but we're going to do some more I'm
especially going to try to hit the sides
up because I don't really know how
they're doing at this point try to work
some some golden magic here I'm going to
hit up the white here again so it's
going to leave a message being like wow
he's doing that so wrong I'm a
professional I've been doing it for five
years
hey foam boards I'll get it fuse
together whoa
how's that look
bob is going to kill me but I was going
to be like Luke you're an idiot and I'm
gonna be like Bob I'm sorry Bob I don't
know what I'm doing
rods gonna be like no no that was a
mistake too wasn't it
it's not super liquidy I'm just ruining
everything
No
you
what is all this goddamnit
I just lost
okay now Eva designed a decision to make
when we tried to fix the white it got
all this crap in it when I sprayed the
top of the case I guess that paint is
very dusty and it leaves a lot of rock
like dust in the air and you can see
there's a bunch of that crap in the
white and it doesn't look good so I'm
going to try to get a bunch of it off in
the most delicate way I can which is not
very delicate and then I'm going to try
to start over I guess like sand this
panel and I'm running out
we're code
the superglue is a little bit crazier
than I had hoped okay so this is the
wall this is the wall that separates
Mexico and the US that apparently Mexico
is going to pay for
every blue painters tape wasn't the
greatest idea that's still very visible
isn't it back to square one again
not like we're not used to that perfect
done okay let's go
there we go oh that side panel though
wait
oh no it's upside-down
oh no okay thank lens maybe if I could
peel up the whole thing and I can put
the whole thing back on the other way
hold on a second let's think about this
is it better upside down like if the
idea is that I've kind of designed a new
flag with the portrait of the brand
leader here is upside down okay okay you
know what we're gonna call that
intentional editor's cut out the part
where I realized for the other side
I want Windows right Windows represent
people being able to come into your
country so instead of a window I'm gonna
have a wall a red white and green wall
it's gonna look a little something like
this yeah that's right I'm gonna need my
hot glue I actually grabbed my own hot
glue gun just in case Luke was gonna be
reliant on the hot glue as well also it
was adorable
look at this thing no unfortunately no
but definitely pink when it comes to hot
glue it's about length not yours
the scary thing about all the time I'm
spending right now is that I haven't
even begun on my diorama I just need a
little bit more height for my
construction project and this should
take care of it somewhat match the other
ones see there you go now that should
actually work pretty well
now I also brought myself a couple
little characters so did I oh I go
we don't have the same one I sincerely
doubt you have the same characters that
I do who I'm I'm pretty confident in my
ability to be um not yet thank you
though
I wouldn't have I wouldn't have offered
you the same thing now we also need a
lawn
okay um you know what I actually don't
know why I thought I needed this foam
board
what I'm going for here is kind of you
know what I think I will I think I will
use the foam board just because it'll
allow me to lift the whole thing up
after the fact which could help a little
bit now I'm a little worried about not
having actually at all started on the
computer but I will get to that later I
hope
wow I'm already down to the whole glue
stick I have used a lot of this and I am
nowhere near done fortunately I can
switch to hot glue for most of the
upcoming construction and I do have a
fair bit of that okay so here we go my
first diorama project since elementary
school I guess I should kind of map this
out a little bit I could use a piece
favorite so I need four in the front and
six in the back
okay so on this side I want sparkly gold
then we're going to put the mannequin
head on a slight angle give it a little
trunk hair put money all around it in
diamonds
and maybe label label maker some of his
quotes so this side is going to be all
glam and glitz
those look sufficiently up now
please God don't kick it on our way up
and let's go and then so this is going
to go here and then it's going to have
this on it for the top bit so this is
for the power supply I was told that I
can't wreck the power supply so I am
going to not wreck the power supply get
it it's plating gold plating for 8 for 8
668
this stuff which is like a paint which I
should be able to squeeze out so I can
like get some of this stuff done if I
want to so that's an option I have this
thing
so Brandon accidentally stepped on my
side panel a few times and it's here it
was on this corner and then all over the
I don't think he's stepping all over
this one used up a whole bunch of paint
I don't have enough paint anymore to
paint the back of the brackets and I
don't have enough paint to fix that
so I don't really know what's new
I'm gonna figure out some way to fix it
but no idea
what is it sticking at all
I know there's a giant ping line this is
great um that's that's that and I don't
even have a hot glue gun
come on Oh
so that is the outer walls of my house
now your glue gun works perfectly the
warcraft ii reference whoa it's still
melting the styrene under the paper
oh crap sickles look at me I could be
cracked
meanwhile the wives and girlfriends of
all the people watching this video are
just like he has no idea what he's doing
if he just used c42 hot glue on foam
board hot stuff man that's gonna be the
white apples a little pro Clegg my papa
okay I don't remember what these are for
oh this is awful
everything about it is awful crap
wish I had my wife to help me with this
kind of up to there what I'm gonna need
in order to make it somewhat realistic
looking some windows good work the
second time okay there's my windows yeah
baby I am going to glue this down so I'm
committing at this point there's no time
to redo everything that I've done on it
anyway so I'm going for the gussto here
oh I never checked the centering on that
oh boy
well I hope that's somewhat close
actually to the eye that seems okay I
think we're all right okay so this baby
is going to go in here and this is going
to go right here and then I got to
figure out my pillars Oh that'll do it
all right rock on Linus you marvelous
stud I'm sure the entire Internet is
going to be criticizing my rolling
technique too is going to wow the judges
oh I love it I got to tell you Luke
you're up against some unexpectedly
legit diorama skills here I have spent
the majority of my time on my diorama so
far which is not because that's what I
wanted to do but that's because that is
what happened I hope so
- always finishes because I need the
joke to be visible but I also don't want
it to look completely like comical and
huge I had originally intended to just
have a face there but just because of
the dimensions
I think that's works a little bit better
I'm still pushing towards the finish
line
I still got to build a computer so
Oh No
I don't really know what to do here but
look how much time I'm assuming we have
left I will not be able to okay well
that's good
I needed it I'm going to get rekt too
hard see what Linus didn't know is that
you could put your budget literally into
your computer so my solution here is to
plate my graphics card with money if the
judges see money they might want to take
it in order to take it they obviously
have to you know vote for me because
that's how voting works isn't it
you
this is so not really okay this whole
build is so not okay
okay so we're both super over time I
kind of have a feeling that Linus is
kind of done and is just kind of doing
stuff so that the contest is able to
continue because I'm literally not done
yet
okay apparently he's still doing things
I still think I'm going to get
completely wrecked at the end but I'm
just trying to like have something
that's that's yeah that is my goal at
the moment have something present
anything exists for some form of reason
that is my current goal explain to at
least some level why the f I even
entered this contest yeah all right that
helps a lot it's these little finishing
touches that I've got to start getting
to right now so okay so first of all
this is a functionality upgrade because
I didn't realize until I was building
the PC itself that my water cooler on
the top the performance would be
impacted by my diorama so I added an
airflow shroud so that it'll be able to
exhaust all of its hot wind out the back
and then the last thing that I did was I
created a sales brochure so that the
judges will know exactly what it is
they're looking at and be able to judge
it as favorably as possible okay let's
go oh yeah this is really a change brush
I don't I can't hear a damn thing I can
change its time go lessees loudly scary
okay you're about to walk over you'll
see that John is fine what wow that's my
theme we did do the same thing
you do the same thing is that the White
House yeah okay mines the wall on the
other side there's people tripping over
it this oh there but third Donald Trump
both of them hmm
okay so little Vegas look at this whoa
whoa I'm trying to get over
they are blond-haired okay following
their Mexican okay are they trying to
get into Mexico then can we even show
this on the channel I think like I ask
that every week I feel like they're
supposed to be ethnically indeterminate
um I don't think it's really hot or what
at this ooh they are oh so all of you
have done and just or just others
emotion oh that is the gang out wait
okay so let's have a look here is this
okay
oh it's a it's the border wall that you
need the Mexican government or pay for
okay yeah
and certainly this PC was proudly made
in Romania does it say Oh Trump you see
oh wow I don't even like okay so see
here um like how heroes like cancer I
like how we replace the phone hey what
are the nine stripes emblematic where
are the stars where's the blue on the
flag yeah um it's Trump looking shifty I
Oh
so we have an American flag or subside
this it's upside down which is a signal
of distress is is is the Builder of this
trying to make some kind of political
statement here or is this just for I
don't know so we have a gold like a
gold-plated power supply a bunch of
Canadian I mean monopoly money sorry um
we have diamond plastic diamonds I guess
and a glass of that might just be flat
Pepsi but I want to just pretend that is
wine um some literally gold-plated oh
that's no one after the I like how the
motherboard goes with the rest of the
build a source of color scheme because
it's sort of like a dark orange egg both
have the same motherboard John I used
black cable mod cables you sweet look
cuz he's the white ones
haha what is where they're on here yeah
you can see that it's kind of coming off
like everywhere so what like there's a
lot of painting though so which one has
the more impressive wall this one
apparently they force the Mexicans to
pay for it but this one has actual
people this has so motion and it is your
wall apparently has no emotion okay he
just called mine an elementary school
project that is exactly what I did is
this just taped on what's that way and
it looks like it was attempted to be hot
glued but that probably didn't work very
well so unless this is temporary to
secure it while if I could be like are
we supposed to take that off if we took
that office no no no no don't think this
whole panel makes me feel safe
really the gun the gun is pointed
directly at the temple of trumps head
that is that symbolism is he being
controlled by you know someone else mm
interesting this this bill just got meta
oh man
I believe note to say that I have
nothing to say because we actually judge
this based on quality well it's a very
square White House it appears to be
missing the entire West Wing where the
president office actually is course John
knows some useless crap like that if you
google White House that's what comes up
I do like how this was made an obvious
reference to remade Mexico pay for it
with the wall here right it is in the
instant of its in the closures and
that's can tricolor three accurate I
I dress so oh I do like how it says
Trump presidential hotel yes if you had
ready it says thank you I told you you
did it
Jones like wool no it says this seems to
be to about the standard of trumps home
with equality though Trump what quality
normal build quality of his of his
hotels and various other establishments
Wow um
says scale replica and it's not and I
just don't want to be lied to
but that's true it also says a bunch of
other crap about hi what metric is this
30% more Trump compared to a regular
Tower
um there's like the international unit
of know Trump it's just it just is like
what this is trumped-up judging it
something got going on here is defending
a metaphysical point we ever had this
happen I don't know I think they're
being really harsh on my bill here
brings to America do they even know the
theme is the future can you go tell them
the theme is not Trump the theme is the
future I mean I walked over here I saw
both Trump bills and I was like this is
certainly a potential look at the future
if you look at it as this side being
America on this side being Mexico or
Canada is Trump will probably build a
wall up here to how am I going get back
home then it's a great question
oh thank god Audrey Wow it's Lois
it's the oldest opieop their goal for
the idea of a dystopia sure I think
they've got it yeah it is a dystopian
future that but do you think I want the
trunk to turn the White House into a
hotel just makes me mad when I have to
watch them judge things I feel like I'm
being judged what I almost wonder if
it's happening is if earth knows which
computers which and he's just trying to
troll you I know you know he would and
you know he'll knows yeah I like the
simplicity well at the same time I don't
like the simplicity it's perfect for the
average from supporter to understand it
better but that's not me Wow I'm really
sure there should be doors in more
places what a construction construction
favorite feels like I could have done it
in the third grade so I give it a 5/5 I
thought do they know how long we have to
work on these okay go
I thought that the overall approach to
hashtag mega was fine and I did enjoy
the use of the trumpet phases but at the
same time there could have been a bit
more continuity throughout the bill I
felt like the Mexico wall was a bit I
was a bit less brutal than Etzel giving
Megha a generous seven out of ten if
it's a generous seven that's over though
I do think the execution was slightly
crude because the theme seems just to be
kind of struck face everywhere um which
I mean which as funny as the Trump faces
are and they are don't get me wrong I do
feel like maybe a little bit more yeah
there you go
yeah I feel like a little more nuanced
probably would have been good with life
to a scene on the actual eagle and snake
on the border wall so we don't mistake
it for it Italian flag which I actually
did
first overall not bad definitively
trump-like
and i gave it a six out of ten six looks
like no one made it through this round
of layoffs
I like the muted colors it kind of says
bleak future you know I feel safer I
feel like I have my privacy intact here
I have to give it a seven unfortunately
it does feel too real and it scares me
for me the Vegas bill felt a bit more
complete when I thought the theme was
Trump not the future why would the bean
be Trump why did you vote no Trump
computer I did feel like the facade on
the front of the build was a nice touch
you know it does feel very Trump
however shot me done however shoddily
done your king house
I liked the image ran of you know Trump
being controlled by an outside force
with the gun pointing directly at the
side of the head I actually got a
visitor
um I like the indeterminate racial
family that doesn't let you know if
they're trying to get into America or
out of it over the Trump wall uh and I
like the defense mechanisms of kyra foam
on the Trump wall uh well the money in
the fake diamonds inside did provide a
very trunk feel it was very unclear what
the message was there whether that's you
know America will become prosperous or
America will spend too much or you know
it's all just fake in a sham and overall
in the theme of the future it's a bit
tough to say
this really hit the nail on the head so
I gave a is a slight edge at 7.50
annular like the hoses all right Arab
John with that let you do that
first of all immediately I love how the
front is very striking it reminds me so
much of the Trump International and
Vegas looks exactly like it if you
wanted the theme to be dystopia you
absolutely nailed it you kind of nailed
it with like the muted colors um with
like all this going on back here this is
super creepy because it looks like
Donald Trump has like channeled his soul
into like a young albino woman and I
think ID on that and said it best
sometimes I want to hold your hand just
means I want to hold your hand
I should think more points off for that
but um I I really liked about this is
that I think the theme on this one was
much much more consistent if like I said
if you're go for dystopia I think you
nailed it so I gave you well I would
have given you a nine but I took off one
point of this mouse and one point off
this one because the theme was supposed
to be the future and I honestly think
it's very unlikely the Trump will win so
Vegas gets oh wow I did not see this one
coming
actually crushing crushing defeat at the
hands of the world's worst no one even
noticed the paint job on the front
literally looks like you dragged it
across the floor while you were waiting
for it to dry we did it's just better
than I feel so thanks for checking out

apparently lost again and not by onion
margin but I think you can let us know
