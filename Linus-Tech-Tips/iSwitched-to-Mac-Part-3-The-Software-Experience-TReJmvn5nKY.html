three of I switched to the iMac the
software experience I'll still be doing
at least one more look at the hardware
with a focus on thermal throttling and
gaming performance of the r9 295x2 but
this is really the meat and potatoes of
what it was like for me as a longtime
the windows only guy to use a Mac for
over a month as my daily driver it is by
no means comprehensive I used the
machine like I'd expect a mostly normal
person to do it without registry edits
and add-ons up the wazoo but I feel like
it gave me a good feel for what the Mac
experience is supposed to be like and
I'm hoping to get that across to you
guys so here we go
the Coolermaster neptune 240 m features
an exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive
near-silent performance click now to
learn more let's jump right in shall we
instead of night comm I used get Mac
apps which generates a string of text
you paste into terminal dot app that
installs all your stuff for you and then
started setting up all my network shares
and whatnot then I spent a fair bit of
time in the System Preferences menu
discovering really cool stuff like the
ability to log into my gmail and social
media accounts within the OS using an
application-specific password just like
on a phone to effortlessly set up the
messaging client for my hangouts chat
though it was hard to use because my
message is sent through other devices
wouldn't show up on the Mac the default
email client so that notifications
popped up on my desktop just like that
and the calendar so all the stuff I need
to do is at my fingertips and the
struggling to understand some of the
truly asinine stuff like the inability
to disable scroll wheel acceleration
something that makes using a physical
wheel Mouse extremely unpleasant in OS
10 Yosemite and that ultimately along
with the very convenient two fingered
swipes to change spaces or virtual
desktops forced me to keep using the
phenomenally under ganach well though
for a couple bucks you can fix that with
a third-party application I am told
expose now called Mission Control excuse
me
access is another thing that I changed
by default you reach it by double to
finger tapping the mouse very unnatural
and obviously a touchpad design gesture
or by moving the mouse to any of the
four corners of the screen but I found
myself doing that accidentally pretty
often so I was extremely pleased to find
that on each corner this functionality
can be disabled outright or it can even
be reassigned to other useful things
like peek at the desktop put the display
to sleep and open up launchpad okay
mostly useful Microsoft deserves the
crap that we gave them over the charms
menu replacing functionality that used
to be in start but it amazes me that
they got so much flack for modern UI
when Apple seems to have completely
snuck under the radar with Launchpad how
is it different except that its icons
instead of live tiles it's worse it's
okay though because just like on Windows
you never have to use it I kept all my
frequently used stuff in the dock and
then for everything else
Apple + spacebar brings up spotlight did
I say Apple I think I make command
whatever you get the point and spotlight
whose ability to guess what you were
looking for and pushed the more relevant
results to the top is worlds ahead of
Windows is built-in search functionality
that has improved to the point where it
actually returns results for for example
Windows update or uninstall but still
presents them in no particular order but
before the Mac users start nodding their
heads knowingly about how silly Windows
is there is some boneheaded and
confusing Mac stuff - especially if you
haven't used OS 10 before while I was in
preferences trying to learn keyboard
shortcuts and turn on repeat for letters
when I hold them down I still couldn't
figure out what was going on without
doing some googling I mean the symbol
for alt slash option and control are
confusing as heck and brightness control
is f-14 and f15 anywhere are those and
while we're at it in preferences why are
the keyboard shortcuts for Mission
Control within keyboard but not within
the Mission Control menu when the mouse
gestures for Mission Control are within
Mission Control and not within Mouse ah
and why do I need a third-party plugin
to see favicons
my Safari tabs how am I supposed to know
what's what chrome me up Scottie but
there's also some usability stuff that
made the Mac a total pleasure to use
having the option when you reboot to
open all your crap when you log back in
is freaking awesome
yay for little time savers spaces is
awesome and super natural to use not as
good as dual monitors or an ultra-wide
but a surprisingly excellent compromise
as a space saver and the way OS 10
manages updates is just nicer than
Windows I can ignore it without being
bothered if I want and but there's no
need to because I can tell it to do it
automatically when I know I won't be
working and thanks to OS tens ability to
open up everything I was doing when I
log back in I know I won't miss a beat I
also like that downloads go to a handy
little dedicated manager popup on the
taskbar excuse me doc instead of being
managed within each browser or forcing
me to dig through Explorer excuse me
sorry finder to track them down but that
leads well into what I think is my
biggest OS 10 complaint it is no wonder
to me that Apple spent so much time
making spotlight awesome because finder
is horrendous here are some complaints
about it in no particular order
sort by is system-wide instead of folder
by folder so it's almost never right
when I open a particular folder to help
me find the most relevant items at the
top instead of having a root directory
for each Drive internal storage all just
gets piled together I mean no wonder Mac
people buy all these external
thunderbolt drives to manage their files
they have no way of knowing what's where
there's legitimately no way to force
refresh the contents of a folder because
it should be automatic which is great
except when it doesn't work and you wait
around for 15 minutes for the file to
show up there are only two thumbnail
sizes and they're buried in some submenu
and again must be changed finder wide
you can't easily cut and paste files and
folders yeah seriously windows people
watching this Mac people need to install
a plugin or must use keyboard shortcuts
to cut paste and finally though this is
a windows complaint to these days why is
up directory missing why do I need to
use the functionally sometimes the same
back
button or breadcrumbs or a drop-down for
this can we please bring that back and
there are other usability things that
arc me to picture importing versus being
allowed to just manage my videos and
images with clearly thumbnail
directories and drag and drop would be
fine if I wasn't usually in a hurry when
I was doing it and I guess the same can
be said for window management it's fine
but it just takes longer full screening
things takes a dog's age for some reason
and is more like theater mode in a media
player then maximise on Windows Aero
snap like functionality can be added
with hyper doc but until you do that
it's basically back to Windows XP style
resizing and dragging around and another
frustrating thing for me anyway is
managing multiple windows within a
single application left-clicking just
vomits them all all over your screen
where you left them and selecting a
particular one lacks a graphical preview
so you're stuck just selecting from a
list which I find slower and less
intuitive I really do like the word
processor pages though aside from the
plug genus of my windows pc using
co-workers needing to rename the dot
pages files to dot zip manually in order
to open them whenever i forget to export
a separate copy for them in god doc I'd
end up really liking it numbers feels
like a bit of a bad joke compared to
excel in keynote I honestly just didn't
use but pages is a pleasure to write in
and I legitimately understand why
writers might use Mac's in order just to
have it especially compared to office
from Mac yeah the only positive thing I
can say about office for Mac is thank
goodness I didn't buy it I installed it
using one of my five office 365 installs
promptly be licensed it and installed
parallels with Windows 8 on it so I
could use office 2013
instead parallels by the way is an
awesome crutch for those looking to make
the switch to Mac because it came in
handy so many times whether I couldn't
find a Mac version of an application or
even just for little stupid things like
installing the drivers to configure a
gaming mouse and you know get the lights
and the you know buttons programmed
correctly before then switching it back
to OS 10
now I feel like I could talk pros and
cons for another probably 15 minutes
here but this is YouTube and I'm likely
already pushing the limits of the
general audiences attention span so I'm
going to try and wrap things up here
there was some stuff about using a Mac
for a month that drove me nuts
changing the back shortcut in finder and
Safari from command open bracket to
something faster requires our registry
edit the position of the command key
from I commonly used keyboard shortcuts
like copy and paste is something I've
pretty much gotten used to now but still
find extremely uncomfortable and little
things like middle clicking to enable
Mouse crawling requires a 14 dollar app
called smart scroll and I'll be damned
if I'm buying that instead of a dozen
chocolate bars but there were things I
liked some first-party app store stuff
like Twitter is awesome compared to the
awful modern UI stuff on Windows 8 add
it in font installation is way better
you just double-click it instead of
dragging it to the fonts folder which is
completely unintuitive on Windows the
inclusion of functional productivity
software like pages is great instead of
expecting you to buy it separately and
parallels is excellent performance with
Windows applications feels very best of
both worlds but none of this was enough
to even begin to tempt me to switch not
because Windows is amazing and perfect
because if not but because it's fine and
the Mac experience was also just fine
not enough for me to spend $3,000 on
this machine the high resolution display
is beautiful but the unexceptional GPU
driving it causes it to chug all the
time and one of the features that I
thought would actually be like a killer
app continuity being able to you know
take phone calls and texts from your
iPhone on the Mac honestly left a lot to
be desired mostly due to the stunningly
poor voice quality on the other end of
the conversation thanks to the computers
top mounted microphone what were they
thinking so I guess that's it for me
then maybe in another 15 years I'll take
another run at the Mac but by then I
suspect even more of what I do will be
browser-based
and the difference between Windows Mac
or back even Chrome OS or Linux based
machines will be even less eliminating
more of the justification that exists
today for buying expensive computers
just for the sake of the OS they run
speaking of oh I don't know I'll just
pick a random word from the last
paragraph let's say browsers our sponsor
for today's episode is I fix it we I
hope all know about their awesome
picture guides over on ifixit.com that
can help with difficult device repairs
and upgrades for phones tablets and even
all-in-one computers just like this one
but did you know about their awesome
line of Pro Tools I bought myself a pro
tech toolkit over a year ago and I've
used the everyday stuff like the
bazillion sizes of Phillips heads that
it comes with lots of times but when
it's really paid off for me is when I've
needed something bizarre like a security
Torx or a tri wing and aside from the
screwdrivers it comes with a whole bunch
of other stuff you need for tweezing
prodding prying and poking while working
on sensitive electronics check it and
all their other cool stuff out today at
ifixit.com slash Linus and use code
Linus to save $10 on any purchase of $50
or more that's it guys thank you for
watching the mostly the conclusion of
the Mac experience ah for me I have run
out of gas here like the video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment if your feelings were
more complicated than this as always we
have links in the video description to
support us you can give us smoke the
contribution buy a cool teaser like this
one or change around this on bookmarked
one with our callate code so we get a
small kickback whenever you buy stuff
