myself I've taken a rampage three
extreme put on a 980 X and an old-school
8800 GT X that actually has an
ultra-cool on it but I assure you it's a
GT X so this is the rampage three
extreme that I unboxed and one thing I
did want to talk about briefly was these
four buttons here this is pretty much
the coolest feature ever and if they had
a unit of time large enough then I could
probably tell you how much time this
would have saved me over the years if
I'd had this on my motherboards because
typically whenever I'm setting up a
system for myself I'm water cooling the
video card so when you're
troubleshooting something it would be a
lifesaver to have these basically what
they do is they turn on or off each of
the four PCI Express 16x slots
individually allowing you to easily
troubleshoot without removing graphics
cards which is very very difficult to do
when you've got water blocks on the mill
anyway so for my amusement I have a
rampage three extreme set up with 24
gigs of ocz ram and the stock shipping
bios some 980 X and I just wanted to see
if it would post so I press Start and
let's find out you can discover with me
how compatible this is with 24 gigs of
ocz ddr3 1333 c9 1.6 5 volt memory let's
see if it can handle the heat CPU fan is
spinning up do we have any diagnostic
diagnostic diagnostic diagnostic LEDs on
this file I want my camera focus this is
kind of weird it's like a Donald blur
tastic out there goes ok it did not work
so it looks like you'd need to do a
little bit more work on optimizing it in
order to get it to post with 24 gigs of
ram so what's quite possible is I'm just
going to turn it off here now I think
this is the mem ok button although I'm
not sure it's positioned in the same
spot as the mem ok button on so many
boards pressing it seems to have turned
on the board so we'll see what happens
here and then maybe I'll just keep the
camera rolling and see if I can get this
to work here for for my viewers so far
no dice oh oh oh there goes I think so
I saw the number lock turn on come on
well we got no display output I'm 99.9%
sure that that video card works so why
don't I just quickly make sure that my
DVI cable is plugged in correctly which
it is okay so that isn't the problem why
don't we try something else really quick
here let's make sure that my 8 pin
connector is plugged into the correct
one of those two yeah
yeah I got it in the right one maybe
we'll try a quick BIOS reset although
I've I've yet to run into a situation
where you actually have to clear CMOS on
a brand new board usually they come with
a a very cleared seamos so I've gone
ahead held down the clear CMOS button
let's see what happens this time what
I'm going to do next is I'm going to
remove one of the kits of memory because
a lot of the time that can be what's
causing the problem is that you need to
go into the BIOS set the memory to the
correct settings and then you'll get a
post situation now what made me think it
was going to post last time with all
three LEDs rond and then only one
switched on which typically means that
we're about to see a display I'll see
you there it's losing focus again that's
so bizarre we'll look at something else
and look back I've never seen my camera
do this before it's very strange
yeah well their seats back now okay so
that didn't work this let's call this on
Linus tech tips episode on
troubleshooting so with 99.9% of socket
1366 motherboards i'll that's i x58
boards you're going to want to take out
the modules that are closest to the CPU
sockets so the the triple channel set
that starts here because most of these
boards are set up so that the primary
channels are further away because when
you're using big air coolers they will
often overhang that first in slot so
that's why the motherboard manufacturers
typically do that for you so let's see
if we get it to post here hopefully we
don't have a more serious problem and we
are actually able to get a display and I
sure wish it would stop doing that huh
so that didn't work either there you go
we might we might have a more serious
problem here so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to put my camera down for
a second and I'm gonna run and grab
another video card because you never do
no and make sure that this adjustable
rail power supply is going correctly
okay why don't we try an 8800 GT s 640
super super clocked if it matters but it
doesn't okay
800 GTX goes there GTS 640 goes here
this one I know works because I pulled
it out of my little brother's computer
on the weekend and it's been running
rock solid in there for months and
months and months so I'm going to go
ahead and throw that in there and then
let's see if we can get it to give me a
display output wonder if I've got a DOA
board actually I guess I could have do a
ram - it's hard to say I know the CPU
works because I've been using it in the
Quad SLI rig but I don't know the
motherboard is a bit of an unknown the
Rams a bit of an unknown and I've
actually had a little bit of difficulty
with this power supply posting with some
boards it's a very very good unit but it
seems to have a little bit of trouble
posting with certain boards from time to
time
yeah that didn't that didn't do it
either okay so it wasn't the video part
so that's not typically one of the next
steps that I go through so what we'll do
is we'll pull out some more RAM so I'm
just going to keep those keep each
triple-channel kit sort of with it's
correct dims let's find out which one is
actually slot number one ABC so I think
a is actually at so a is over here so
we're going to just go ahead and run it
with just that one stick and see if we
can get it to go for us I actually have
some other ddr3 on hand here I'm just
going to go back out into my computer
room got some g.skill here so I'll go
ahead and pull that off that board see
if we can make it work with that you
know I feel bad for anyone who has to do
troubleshooting like this without a
bunch of tester parts on hand because it
really does make life a lot easier it
might just be that it doesn't like 4 gig
dims right off the bat here so let's
pull that one out put that with its
brother and sister let's throw a 2 gig
stick in here ok let's see what happens
with that start hopefully it'll start
this time this whole experiment could be
just one big failure but you never know
until you try right ok
gone each time to chime okay all right
we have new solid light on the monitor
well this was fun maybe I'll do an
updated video when I figure out what
went wrong we have a cat visiting us
hello
well there you are he's exploring my my
room full of random junk including
obviously wildlife here okay well yeah
hopefully this is as simple as a UH as a
dead board or something or maybe it's
something as stupid as I've gone and you
know I wonder if you actually have to
plug in these molex these extra molex
connectors although I've never seen a
board yet that requires them if you've
only got one video card installed well
better luck to me next time I suppose
hopefully I'll have a chance to do an
update thanks for checking out my video
blog on the rampage 3 extreme and how so
far it did not work at all yet but we're
getting there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
