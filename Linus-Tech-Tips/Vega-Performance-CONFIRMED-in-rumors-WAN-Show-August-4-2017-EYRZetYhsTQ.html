still so all day early yeah it's amazing
we've with water that's quite good this
is the earliest the land show has ever
been yeah if we were super popular
youtubers I would just smash this on the
ground and then get tons of more views
it's not a thing now that's the thing
what why but we are just very not a bird
we're just mostly popular yeah the whole
Princess Bride mostly popular and
ridiculously on time dad are mostly dead
we're just mostly for mostly dead meme
um so we are taking the longest long
weekend of all - media group time - me
except you we're taking Friday and
Monday off so we decided to stream on
Thursday so that everyone except Luke
yep who works at a different company now
yeah good for him the left in this case
never never time off where it's bad for
him yeah and you're working you're still
working the Friday right yep Monday
after Monday that's not even it not
everywhere all right mm-hmm
national holiday really half of my full
time force is not in Canada right so
there you go
what national holiday is it I don't know
it's something I don't know
it's a stat though is it isn't it is it
even have I been fooled by all the other
staff I'm pretty sure - stat Canada -
we're horrible Canadians ah
good I'm pretty sure it isn't Good
Friday
hold on there 16 more rows look Oh God
Valentine's how are Valentine's Day as
them civic holiday
what is the odbc day ah BC and then they
all have like their own so that's why we
don't know or good that doesn't get the
day off but the ban oh hey I didn't
realize that
yeah yeah we're just literally all
working not even national there you go
so I can't take the day off because no
one else is and that's stupid
well I'd say it's rough but I don't have
to like come to work so I can sit in
like my boxers at home okay work on
soleplate I'm sorry it's kind of like
that's nice yeah
so it's like it's uh it's like casual
day yeah yeah except you can actually
just have your junk hanging out oh yeah
cool so it's like a very casual day okay
so here's something that I want to know
yeah and we'll get into okay hold on
let's introduce no no we'll get into
topics very important okay all right
okay
now we all know PC culture right okay
right everything's politically exact now
there's no you can't yeah I wasn't
actually sure if you're talking about
personal computer or politically karana
corner I'm not going to ask obvious
question okay okay and you can't
discriminate based on anything that's
something on my head but what if the
persons are nudists what okay so if you
have dress code if you had a cat but
hold on hold on oh there's one okay look
look if you had a casual Friday okay and
you did not have a company dress code
which we don't and somebody showed up
naked and there was no policy in place
is it discriminatory it's still
technically a government sanction though
is it well yeah because it's indecency
oh it is yeah there's a law for that
indecency yeah
ah then there's the flippy
back-and-forth II law thing where like
certain like I in in most areas I think
women can't have their tops completely
off because you can't show your nipples
but then in some places you're like on
twitch yes but then I believe in
Vancouver you can because of
what's-her-face
Linda whatever it was there's some like
nudist protester who was always all over
the place top and then they were just
like whatever we don't care and then I
think they gave up I think the same
thing I think I'm not really sure ah
there's other areas where it's okay okay
okay I'll so like I think you'd be able
to lie
just have bottoms on in most places got
it
I don't know fascinating okay so we've
actually got a lot of great topics for
you today
competition is great for the industry
Nvidia claims 3x performance with a new
driver update for the Titan XP I wonder
what prompted that driver update just to
be clear because I really hate when
these things are vague because it drives
me freaking insane it not really formats
in specific application shot games AMD
clarifies why thread Ripper uses four
dies on the chip what else we got gtx
1070 killer killer RX vega 56 benchmark
again like everything else from every
other companies everything gets leaked
because that's that's advertising right
now
hey Late Late all over the place oh my
god
I'm Purvis it's really odd so I wouldn't
be surprised I actually I'm feeling
pretty good right now
ice water down the carnage it there you
go RX Vega prices and bundles have been
confirmed late confirmed leaks could
whatever leaked firms welcome to the
news firmly leaked and from time it's
gonna cause some firm leakage on my side
yeah I wish I wasn't drinking I wish you
weren't drinking at work soon but what
can I do about it
casual progress madam drink ah you drink
one yeah cool mother Griffith Sarge
leaking jerky no that's not what it is
no oh boy you know what this is going to
be a fun show because it has a show it
was a short week yes but it was already
a hell of a week I shot my inverse
fluoride cinemagraph this week those are
cool what what are you doing okay so
going on hopefully none of this is
embargoed or anything but MSI actually
sent a photo crew out here from like I
don't know the the kind of director the
art director was from Sweden and she was
hilarious she was like the most
stereotypically Swedish woman I've ever
met
looks like the hair in the like curly
thing and the flower and freakin
everything she was delightful and you
know what
she came with complete instructions and
didn't fall apart in two weeks
no three no go figure
anyway um so so she had me they actually
used a lot of our equipment which was
cool made me feel very professional but
like this like these things real this
baller photo crew that travels around
the world you know doing professional
shoots and stuff was like oh yeah that's
pretty good equipment maybe we'll use
that they even roast our greens cream
just pretty cool yeah so they had me set
up in front of the green screen and they
had me do like these like these little
like actions like I was supposed to be
like like looking off the body because
the rest of the frame will be still and
if you're not familiar with what if
cinemagraph is intros really cool so I
can try to pick them up while you yeah
if you want to grab a couple is your
screen sharing working yes Oh fantastic
so most of the frame is still but then
selectively there's a little bit of
motion so it's actually an MSI here I'll
flip over to so there you go so she's
still the wall still but the but the
bubbles blow which is which is pretty
cool there's another really cool one um
if you go down this one's really good
this one's really good yeah so the mugs
teams that everything else is everything
else is completely that's not like like
nothing in here would naturally move but
it yeah not like it there's mostly no
movement there's actually none except
for this thing yeah so what's the post
of the one in this one is I'm supposed
to have the MSI infinite a gaming PC
like hovering under my hand like some
wizard wizard stuff and then I'm
supposed to like look at it and then
like slightly glance to the camera but
everything about me will be maybe still
or maybe they'll put a little bit of our
movement to like be manipulating this
like spinning PC and yeah I'm
I don't know it was like an hour of it
was an hour of shooting with just me
and then they had like another two hours
with the system and with they're
actually going to do it in our workshop
set so I'm not going to be in like some
weird location or something so here's a
here's another example I'm loading
loading wow this is not a great way to
go Twitter
way to go Twitter but this is a razer
cinemagraph yeah so the other is the guy
doesn't move but like the colors change
oh whoops run me except it just keeps
like loading and freezing because yeah I
don't know either Twitter or our Wi-Fi
so it's like that but better yeah yeah
pretty much
sweet um but they're cool so that was
fun what were you up to this week this
week Wow Wow
I hired someone I thought I got and then
like didn't really get but maybe still
he's gonna mess with you message me
later a domain thing have you heard
something about it not I heard from him
he said he's gonna check his email but
he hasn't done it yet so we'll see ah ah
all right do you I was very busy but I'm
trying to remember everything that I did
figured out some weird stuff with some
tax things figured out that maybe we
have to go to America balancing the pros
and cons of just straight up moving to
Quebec so there's been a lot of it's
been a lot of we will have to speak
French no I can't stress this we'll have
to speak round Larney they will hate you
yes especially because my last name I
will actually be lynched Anglophones
that move over there and like straight
up are like hello Bonjour I would like
to order waffles Jose right they waffles
like no they're gonna hate I'm going to
have to I'm going to have to like get
all my food delivered from Amazon or
just buy it at Costco and literally
never say a word
I've gotten through certain foreign
countries that way but it's like
pretending I'm mute and just being like
I know how all this stuff works and just
like being obvious about things and then
just never talking and just it works
it's fine
okay back nah ha ha ha oh man but like
yeah ok seriously right now and there's
some theories and a prime actually has a
very L always a peak English you are
stupid English people that dynastic yeah
yes some of you do yeah if you go to
Montreal sure but you make your way out
into the burbs and it's a whole other
story yeah so I've been looking through
resumes and a very very large like 75 80
85 % of the strong resumes are from
Montreal or Quebec or or Quebec City or
Verdun or whatever there's quite a few
different areas but it's all in Quebec
to some degree a huge percentage of it
interest and not even just programmers a
lot of different talent that I'm looking
for seems to be over there and run
english-speaking ones are moving to the
state got to make my times theory is the
francophones don't want to move I hate
her at a really long one so like like
really good programmers from other parts
of the country that are English means
speaking right either like moved to the
States
right where everyone else moved to the
space so they stay here and get paid
Ludacris notes right
fascinating all right yeah I don't know
we recorded yes uh no you clean no we
are actually very live right now we're
thinking of spoofing you guys and yeah
playing this on Friday and then we were
like ah yellow whatever yeah all right
so um should we do an actual tech topic
here I mean we can I mean this one's
pretty interesting math underscore
settings on the forum was the original
poster for this the tight typos those
will be max settings yeah I don't even
you know
maybe it's like a maybe it's a Star Wars
reference okay but isn't that Maz which
doesn't make any sense but uh you know
what
just whatever ah did I just correct you
on a Star Wars thing I have very much
and very deep Star Wars knowledge I know
none of it is canon anymore all right
all right hot you want hot Rand Admiral
Thrawn mare Jade fine colonel throat's
cannon
if you cannon yeah shut up he got
brought back in oh hell yeah the new
animated series rebels that is like if
that that storyline grandma throne thank
goodness because like out of all the
like legions of Star Wars writers
Timothy Zahn it's got to be ya know he's
a super stoked right now because it's
like a show about his character that's
fantastic yeah and it's like actually
really cool cuz it brings a more dynamic
character in Star Wars universe
did they somewhat stick to the I see I'm
I like been watching a show so you
haven't started it no okay got it and
I'd know what I know that in there yeah
okay okay alright and like okay I have
heard from the writer that he really
appreciates the depiction of his
character so he must have stuck with how
he was fantastic well I am soaked on
that I you know what's another one
that's okay that's all the books or
Canon no they're super not um I would
okay I will get back to tight next in a
minute because is more important uh-huh
you know what's another really great
opportunity for first for for
adaptations to film is have you read the
tales from the Maus Eisley cantina no or
cantina
whatever it is convenient I think really
good it's just a collection of short
stories in fact I think it's from a
bunch of different writers but there are
some well-known ones like a Kevin so
it's like and generally for Star Wars
sort of it's it's the back stories of
like everyone who's in there
oh that's cool yeah how people know
about like the doctor and stuff yeah
because like I know some of
like factoids but I had up that makes a
lot more sense coven terrific or like
what book would this be in yeah that
makes way more sense yeah so it's
actually like they're they're really
good and there's such a variety from
from short story he's in rogue one Todd
no uh the the crazy doctor guy but oh
yeah what's his face I got remember the
guy whose I have the death sentence on
12 systems getting on your cell system
yeah Mac PC box PlayStation 4 what are
you talking about that has driven me
crazy like and that that's the kind of
stuff that I probably would have fixed
in a special edition right right right
but yeah fix one word and all of a
sudden this sentence makes any sense
that dude is in rogue one it's like a
weird Ram you know helix slides past the
screen alright and there's been some
controversy there because like the town
that they're in blows the hell up so
everyone's like how did he make it or I
guess no that's after yeah so it's no
yeah so he must have gone there and then
he died well he has the death sentence
onto himself okay go back are taken care
of but I'm oh yeah so I'm okay okay okay
fine we'll talk we'll talk about this
basically NVIDIA posted a blog post
techniques P enables new levels of
performance for creative professionals
our latest driver available today
delivers three times more performance
and applications like Maya you can
create and design faster than ever
before and when you're done you can rip
through battlefield one hundred frames
per second the best part is it's
available from Nvidia calm yeah that is
what that's part um yeah not GeForce
experience so it's also available there
here's why okay while I appreciate the
gesture this is why um no competition is
a big load of bullcrap
because Nvidia to their credit has
actually done a reasonably good job with
the technology available to them of
iterating and driving graphics
performance faster and faster and faster
in basically the complete absence of any
competitor over the last few years when
it comes to gaming yeah where they have
cut
back and they had scaled back especially
and to be clear I have my criticisms of
Nvidia the fact that we now get each
generation of GPUs as two generations of
g-forces with but the second the cut
down card as a flagship and then we get
the real one as a next generation
flagship okay so I've got my issues when
I'm super frustrating which is
frustrating clear but I understand the
business reasons why they're doing it
and it's not that bad they are still
developing new GPUs even if that
development is driven by professional
use and the data center our title is LTX
2017 oh is it an IRA can you pick Serge
you want I can show you just had a
category room to news and talk ah
Fridays at 30 Pacific ish yeah that's
okay I'll just lead it and got Oreos
talk shows hot shall we go
bippity Boppity done thank you viewer
okay remember the first tightening yeah
was actually suitable for workstation
use yeah so it was actually capable of
less cut down FP 64 performance compared
to the gaming cards it was more like a
Quadro in that sense since then not only
Titans but also Quadros have not had the
same functionality enabled compared to
their Tesla counterparts yeah and then
in the case of the very high end Tesla
GP 100 that melon has excellent high
precision performance as well so this is
basically Nvidia like rien locking
something that they locked away because
they didn't have to deal with it which
is frustrating but also I'm glad that we
have it like I'm happy it happened I'm
but sad that it had this looks like a
blatant response to Vega and the rumors
around Vega are that regardless of
gaming performance it looks like
it's going to be a pretty powerful
professional platform which is like
weird but cool I can also see why
they're doing it you know like we have a
video coming soon about AMD's Vega based
supercomputer so it's one petaflop on a
single rack and I mean that is between
like between mining and like
professional like research use AMD
cooktop Salmonella more common and you
could probably sell every graphics card
that could possibly make that's great
which is which is which is great um
because they need to because they really
didn't um and I forget where I was going
with that right so that's so bright so
it's not a huge surprise to me that
that's driving their design yeah it's
just it hasn't been very common in in
those style of cards yes alright so
let's move let's do one more topic and
then we'll descend the shower knobs and
I'm kidding middle do ads so AMD
clarifies why thread Ripper is using
four dies so this was supposed to by
Dyson on the form go ahead and pull this
up cuz check that out
there's ideal it'ld thread Ripper this
doesn't make any sense because epic goes
up to 32 course and also sits on a very
similar package with four exposed dies
like this if you were to delete it so
why would thread Ripper also need four
because it doesn't have an 8-channel
memory controller like epic does so it
wouldn't need the two memory controllers
per die and it turns out that what's
going on here is because thread refer
only goes up to 16 course what we're
actually seeing is two fully enabled
dies and then two of them are just
dummies right and the diagonal that's
right so these are supposed to help
spread out the heat load according to
you know what will give us more better
heat dissipation to our coolers or more
evenly dissipate so instead
it being on that diagonal that's kind of
more around better for coolers a lot
better for coolers and the other purpose
of the two dies is actually structural
so they prevent imbalance and allow for
simple cooler mounting without any
chance of damaging the CPU they are not
active they're not like failed rising
cores or anything like that they don't
even contain working transistors so
there's no hope of being able to like
unlock them or some things they are just
dummy course aimed II also didn't want
to create a new socket for thread Ripper
so they like found some ways to take
benefit from having these dummy core
things then you're like cool sounds good
designing a socket is a fairly
significant undertaking
aside from electrically and it's really
annoying yeah not not for AMD it's
really annoying for everyone else
there's this whole new platform new
boards nothing whole new mounting hole
you're not going to be able to transfer
hardware as much it's not be harder to
have stuff on hand if you're swapping
stuff out in like a very high
availability many server type of
situation it's annoying for board
partners you have to make more things
now it's annoying for everyone on the
entire stack yep and you know you look
at something like USB micro-b that
should give you some idea how hard it is
to design a robust reliable interface
yeah and so the fewer of those that AMD
has to build the better yeah cool all
right
oh so sponsors yeah what do we got here
sponsors oh really
Coolermaster is one of our sponsors
today Coolermaster featuring keyboards
covered in dust because our entire
warehouse has been under construction
for the less yeah don't do that
why don't you man yeah what is wrong
with you or so the cooler master master
cheese Pro comes in different sizes with
white lighting or RGB to suit your needs
while the Pro S comes in white and RGB
oh wow level the pro s white and the pro
M RGB are the newest additions to their
lineup they complete the cooler master
keyboard profile or portfolio wow I'm
terrible at this
you got it whatever Coolermaster makes
really good mechanical keyboards they're
great for typing they're great for
gaming I have basically no complaints
they've got bright LED lighting
including the availability of RGB
minimalistic kind of design and the
interior has been completely redesigned
to Victoria MX switches as well as LEDs
the master Keys Pro white N and L have
white LED backlighting and if you're
Moore if you're more into a brighter
clear white backlight versus just
changing your RGB one to white which
doesn't look quite as satisfying yeah
they've got a bunch of different LED
lighting modes macro recording and for
profile keys with easy to use software
basically they're good stuff you can
check them out at the link below right
about yeah cooler master comm / product
/ line / keyboards Wow we really need a
vanity URL for that yeah oh my yeah this
one's got a detachable keyboard as well
are up detachable
potential keyboard detachable cable as
well nice you know it's really nice not
usually usually it doesn't matter at all
but if you're packing up your keyboard
to take it somewhere where there's
actually a risk of damaging the
connector in your bag or whatever it's
nice to be able to which I have had to
do recently and it is it is actually
quite nice yeah next up we've got
squashed a space where space is the
place to go if you want to create your
own place to go yeah with Squarespace
you can take any one of their gorgeous
templates and they've got a lot of them
now actually that would be okay I'm just
gonna I'm gonna cut your hand for saying
I'll let you continue I'm not a
tremendous but I should say should take
that as a slogan a place to go if you
want to make your own place to go it
sounds kind of like like Home Depot sort
of but Squarespace is it not it's kind
of like they're like a Home Depot of
websites yeah I don't know if I'm
allowed to say that no yeah whatever
anyway you pick one of their gorgeous
templates and just for 12 bucks a
month's starting at 12 bucks a month you
get a free domain if you buy it for the
year you just basically go okay I want
pictures here text here add a menu there
it's all cloud-based it is super
reliable and your site will look great
and beautiful on any device whether it's
a laptop desktop or mobile phone even
seen them on smartwatches before really
yeah I can't be that great I mean it was
a website on a SmartWatch so it wasn't
that great but for website it did pretty
good every site includes a free online
store with their commerce module they've
got their logo designer they've got
cover pages which lets you set up a one
page presence in just minutes and you
can start a credit card free trial see
I've recovered that there you can start
a trial with no credit card required
over at squarespace.com slash when then
when you sign up don't forget to use our
offer code use offer code when and
you'll save 10% leading up to our last
sponsor sad jerky which which I hate all
the mojo after the show last week so I
have no mojo no s pyramid universe
Jeremy Natalie so mate bought a bunch of
these yeah even though he's some
revealing and ended up spending like
just put as much on shipping as he did
for the jerky so he's a crazy guy man
well we'll see what he thinks and he has
a crazy spice tolerance so he's going to
try some of those alright it was quick
what kind of punishment do you want
today because honestly most of the most
of the pretty tame stuff has been eaten
oh we do have some traditional Johnson
traditional you can go at attrition I'll
take it this time yes I'm going for the
what Oh mojo habanero yeah oh is that
like the regular mojo okay no I'll take
the hot one
okay I want to I want to try this one
mojo habanero is the one where it's like
hey you pick what everyone right in the
spice profile for me where it's good if
I just don't go way too fast
so three levels or three bars three bars
of spice SoCal and try this one so
savage jerky the jerky is made with the
best ingredients the best without
nitrates or preservatives the goal is to
create a snack that's full of flavor
they definitely achieves that
whether it isn't bad for you although
it's ghostpepper um we've got notes here
about what people seem to love I like
the maple buffalo bacon and I think
Mojo's money mojo is really good mojo
and traditional are both really good and
I think there are there new flavors
aren't they but if you like spicy
there's like ghost pepper and like
Carolina Reaper and like all that kinds
of crazy stuff I need to wait until my
first ones down yeah to get acclimated
to this one but this one tastes really
good to know exactly mojo habanero also
quite nice um that's pretty much it you
don't record lttb but say 10% at Savage
jerky calm and I'll be eating this for
the rest of the show sorry invest
everyone which one did you have today
ghost pepper
all the girls ever is brutal yeah it's
alright yeah yeah mmm
everything's fine this one's really nice
full blame um oh yeah what else but no I
don't have it ready yet but we'll get
ready for school
first up we've got a leak that's right
weakest has left the building
entered the building and drew to this is
supposed to by mr. troll over on the
forum and the original article here is
from tweak town AMD radeon RX vega 56
benchmarks have been leaked and it looks
like according to the leak it may prove
to be a gtx 1070 killer which would be
good for them
tillu 1070 is a very nice card is it a
little bit too hot yeah but I'll get
I'll get it didn't find that one like if
you take it slow is really good yeah I'm
gonna have some more after so
battlefield one has it beating the gtx
1070 said six same thing
doom apparently same thing and cod
whatever i is an infinite infinite
warfare okay i don't know why they
benchmarking that but sure I'm sure
okay anyway it looks like it actually
looks like anywhere from ten to even as
much as almost 15% faster
some of those benchmarks so that would
be great news for Team Red although I
don't know how much stake and doing our
stock to put in this as we know the
price army 99 it is rumored to be 399 in
fact we have all the rumors for Vega
pricing and we will go through those in
a minute
Sal and okay how much is a 1070 right
now let's see GTA mark about 450 450
yeah
so the benchmarks were around at 1440p
battlefield one at Ultra should fix it
ultra with four times multisample
antialiasing doom adultery with tsaa and
it is rumored to be coming in at 399 now
so yeah you can get 450 usually closer
to like 470 480 intimate 499 that will
be pretty killer we don't have a rumored
release date though for though it for
that I don't think so we'll have to wait
and see when it actually shows up right
out of their prices though we do have as
well so this was posted by buck goth on
the forum and this slide here leaked by
WC CF Tech says that it will be
available August 2017 and there'll be a
Vega 64 a Vega 64 limited edition this
we knew about this we talk about when we
did our unveiling at LT X so that's with
a brushed metal shroud and there will be
a Vega 64 liquid-cooled oh what else we
got here not just a lighter colored
brush metal shroud on the liquid cool it
looks like it it may not even be lighter
right I don't know why I went so light
yeah nobody does silver right now yeah
it's like they want the reference card
to clash with everything okay so here's
the rumoured pricing the Radeon aqua
pack which is supposed to include the
liquid card with um what's probably with
the rest of the equipment you need to
run it I'm assuming I have to see what's
rumored
um no but I beg of egg Vega Vega Vega
Vega spec specs box reference model so
it's that $4.99 apparently for the 64
limited edition - 95 watt card wow wow
you guys I do I do want to say if you
can scroll down for a second
whoa the liquid cool players appear in
the reader and reason why wow Andy what
are you doing over there buddy
ah okay sorry what were you pointing at
just the fact that this is just like a
thing that's average now twelve point
seven teraflops yeah that's crazy like I
still remember when we like just barely
past one and everyone was like holy crap
Wow a teraflop on a GPU holy smokes
so what else you got here for rumors so
the bundles will apparently include
discounts on select rising CPU and
motherboard combos that's collect
Samsung freesync displays and two game
titles Wolfenstein 2 and prayed - that's
really cool um the the game part is
actually surprisingly less cool than the
other one but would you pay an extra
however much for a bundle oh wait no
this is okay right the packs aren't
rumored right we I've already made a
video about that look I can never tell
what I'm supposed to know I'm not
supposed to know so I do know that okay
but tell me this so what's your thought
process under them can it love the first
time I've heard it looks like the pack
adds about $100 to the card versus if
you were able to just buy it standalone
but then what's the discounts on the
other stuff the disc you pay an extra
hundred dollars and you get a discount
on other stuff but what's the discount
because if I'm gonna buy all if any we
get a hundred bucks off Verizon CT and
motherboard combo or you get up to $200
off a free sync display so if I was
gonna buy a monitor and that CPU in
motherboard anyway then you're thrilled
yeah but were you as an enthusiast I
because the 64 version is only going to
be available at launch with bundles oh
really
okay how does this bundles thing work
our packs or whatever like what are you
actually buying when you buy the pack
you just pay a hundred extra dollars and
you get discount cards yes what you just
get like little paper I'm thinking it's
a great idea to being super mad like
like that it's amazing you just get like
little paper discount cards or like in
the middle or some digital yeah and
presumably based on how promos like this
typically worked at the retailer I used
to work at you'd probably have to use it
like right away okay so now what do you
think that's just weird so the rattling
now the consumer I would just wait until
I don't have to do that anymore okay can
I explain the rationale though unless
for some reason I did want to buy that
specific combination which might happen
oh he's just now getting into PC gaming
I could totally see that as a thing okay
so the rationale is that they don't want
coin miners to just snap them all up and
if I had to guess I would say that this
is amd's Way of punishing coin miners
just charging them more since the value
like the used second hand value of the
cards will be higher than the fricking
retail price AMD might as well take that
money and those people won't care about
monitors or games or CPU by the word
bundles and so it's their Way of
punishing miners and giving an even
better deal is that anyone building a
new PC is that crashing though crashing
like miners aren't buying as many cards
right now that's no I I'm not sure to be
perfectly honest with you I don't know
where the whole mining scene is at what
yeah it's on the up again again
all right well apparently mining is back
so so so that's one way for like a week
or two
really really okay so now that you know
that now what do you think I did it's
just weird
as I can see as someone who's buying a
new computer I would look at that and be
like especially someone who's not into
mining and has no idea what it is I
would look at this setup and just be
like what the hell is going on and
that's like the majority of the people
they're going to be looking at this just
to be completely honest right the
majority of the people that are looking
at this is going to go mining what or
like I heard my friend talking about
that why do I care just want to buy
grass I just don't get it because like
my kids don't have graphics cards so why
do miners need all these graphics cards
alright it like pretty high up there for
bad in other news tape storage yeah
media that just keep our lawn cannon oh
yeah this was posted on the forum by WM
groom aka the original article here is
from ARS technica IBM and Sony have
figured out how to cram 330 terabytes
into a tiny tape cartridge sputtered
magnetic layer lubricant and new heads
an able 200 gigabit per second per inch
density
yeah per second I was like whoa man yeah
that would be some fast tape you go so
this is a yeah you know so this would be
330 terabytes in a palm-sized cartridge
the world's largest largest hard drives
by contrast which are about twice the
physical size of the take are the 60
terabyte Seagate SSD or 12 terabyte
Hitachi helium-filled hard drive pretty
cool the largest commercially available
tapes only serve up 15 terabytes so when
it's eventually commercialized these new
cartridges will be significantly more
expensive because of the tapes complex
manufacturing process likewise a new
tape drive will be required but we'd
only need like to to back up our entire
petabyte project yeah because there's
some redundancy it's not actually a
petabyte of addressable space yeah all
right this is kind of
bummer this is posted by Morgan MLG Minh
coffee lake so that Intel's
upcoming rumored to be up to six core
mainstream processors will apparently
not not work
that's that mute mute mute God will not
work with VG 70 yeah yeah done yeah mind
you this shouldn't be a surprise to
anyone who's been following Intel's
process your motherboard cadence over
the last few years because V 170 MZ 270
same socket ok the chips that were can
either work in both as long as there's
BIOS compatibility usually two gems and
it's usually two gems on the mainstream
so and there was probably a significant
reworking that was required in order to
put a six core on the mainstream it is
interesting the earth that right now
it's not possible for people during the
biggest war intel has had in a while
because they haven't had a war in a
while that both sides would have to
upgrade their whole platform hmm because
right now if you if this happened a year
ago you wouldn't have had to upgrade
your platform right Intel fans would
have been able to buy the new chips buy
the new six cards and that would have
been the excuse I don't want to move to
the other side because I'm just going to
buy a chip not a whole ship and
motherboard combo it can be way cheaper
for me there's no way it's financially
viable for me to invest in a whole
platform now it's a whole platform
versus whole platform hmm
so normal cadence or not I think it
helps AMD a lot that that's happening
rumor though this won't help AMD if it's
true
by friendly non murdering sort on the
forum that's good it's kind of a cool
name ah the original article here is
from guru 3d there's a rumored core i3
8300 with four cores and eight threads
which would make it basically equivalent
to like a 6700 K because it's finally
clocked at like 4 gigahertz I don't know
if this is just someone messing around
with
like Windows registry nonsense to get
this to show up but it doesn't look like
it because there are also um here what's
wait no yeah it's all it's all windows
captures so I'm not aware personally of
a way to do that like off the top of my
head but it seems like something that
could be photo edit it like disgustingly
easily but yeah this is according to
screenshots on a Chinese forum I find
this very hard to believe and I would
think it's more likely for it to be some
weird apparently a yes it's fake yeah
yeah I uh super low res yeah it's pretty
crap um but there you go there's a rumor
oh we got featured on or second good
hours technical which was pretty sick so
I'm just wanna sell to congratulate over
that neat and they wrote up a little
kind of like write-up thing especially a
summary yeah Jake thinks that we should
have a written site to accompany our
videos I disagree I think we went down
that path yep and then we're like wow
wow this is hard and there's no money in
it yeah we discovered fortunately before
we invested our whole livelihood in
print online written websites yeah that
that's a bad idea
yeah um what else we got okay I'm gonna
I'm yeah I got one more topic for you
okay okay so let me picture Ewing let me
pitch it to you while or things well
okay let me pitch it to you while I
while I go through the full plain stuff
you can think about it okay so this is a
new segment that I'm going to call
what's worse so if you want I know I've
already read it I know I know but I got
I gotta get the media to continue hold
on hold on okay so this kind of thing
happens especially to some people but
what's worse dropping your phone in a
public toilet that's empty or in your
own toilet after you peed in it
okay now hold on in other news we have
some exclusive content over on
floatplane that you guys will want to
watch yes
tech quickie what's the difference
between parallel and serial the fastest
ultra wide gaming monitor but at what
cost we can see thumbnails - wow wow
that is a cancerous thumbnail look at it
go um there's exclusive content
mezzanine update number 12 almost there
tech wiki why are PC video game ports is
so bad so bad the worst LTT the
brightest monitor we've ever seen Dells
HDR display AMD let me build their new
ad Vegas supercomputer which they
actually did what else we got more
exclusive stuff LTX behind the scenes
vlog before the show opened loco machlin
um what else we got here I think I think
this one's live already I'm not sure
July 28th no why is Hotel Wi-Fi so slow
that's pretty good tech cookie Pippin
apples only ever made console is still
not on YouTube yeah that's still not on
YouTube so we did a reaction to Apple's
forgotten game console one of our longer
videos mm-hmm yeah actually it's really
long 16 or 17 minute form is one of the
rare actually featuring loop videos yes
yeah and I think there's one more that
I'm missing because there's been a lot
of simultaneous releases lately because
yeah all the rise and thread Ripper and
all the Vega and all that kind of stuff
though yeah I think what goes up I think
there's some good stuff going up this
weekend we're going to have our unboxing
from LTX of the razor toaster okay so if
you guys aren't subscribed to floatplane
already then i'll go ahead and copy that
link into the video description for you
because it's pretty sick early access
better streaming video quality and of
course it helps us keep this whole show
going around here so thank you in
advance okay so I don't think it's that
simple okay
of a question okay so do you need some
clarification yes okay so the public
toilet doesn't have any obvious
like build up in it okay but it's a
public toilet and you weren't
what's again this is another hangout
what's the water level because a lot of
home toilets have a very high water
level and a lot of public toilets have a
very low water level the phone is
submerged so in either case yeah the
phone submerge you got a butcher you got
to go you got to go above the wrist bone
deep in either one it's an interesting
question I think from from reading the
twitch chat it seems like most people I
could be totally wrong but when I looked
at it it seems like most people were
saying good strawpoll good idea you like
most people were saying public toilet
really because it's clean but I am
naughty I actually disagree exactly and
my big thing for it is very narrow
amount of sources of bacteria and other
junk compared to extremely wide range
amount of sources other bacteria
interesting so you're going full science
on your answer here not just like oh I'm
more comfortable with my own pee and my
family's pee yeah versus like a lot of
my own pee versus trace amounts of
somebody else's pee a trace amount of a
huge mix of other people's stuff right
and more aggressive more resilient
bacterias might still be in there for
sure mm-hmm
but that could also be true or saying
all of your own toilet agreed but it
still me it stuff that went through me
as something around me it's just on my
hand yeah yeah it's probably okay okay
and I would do I would do the trick
where you flush it first and then you
grab okay and I would probably grab like
a bunch of toilet paper and then grab it
and blow the note wasn't even for the
sake of argument you can't go get a
rubber gloves like you have to toilet
paper is literally right there you don't
have like you don't have a lot of proof
phone you have a pixel okay yeah you got
to get in there and get it fast yeah I
probably push it
flushing happens really quickly yeah but
flushing also circulates the water
there's a worse chance of it penetrate
membrane or gate drain to the puzzle so
it's screwed because they use cloth
liners in there like speakers and stuff
instead of metal like most phones did
you know about that now there's people
that have like reached into here to try
to clean out there like speaker grille
thing and torn it oh that's a shame yes
it's kind of a mess all right well we've
got the results I'm really excited for
the pixel - am i doing that review I
have no idea I'm down most of you for
her what if you flush your phone down
whoa no you can't do that how big how
tiny is your phone I'm very surprised
all right well what do you think it's
your question I'm going I'm going home
toilet yeah I'm going pee home toilet
why do um for me it's a purely emotional
thing I don't have a scientific basis on
touch other people stuff I just I I find
other people's stuff so remember I'm
coming at this as a parent part of my
daily life is touching other people's
pee and poo yeah so like my comfort
level with that over the last five years
has gotten a lot higher but like with
your own crew but that's like with my
kids yeah
whereas someone else just like oh man
that's yeah and like I at least know
what the cleaning schedule of my own
toilets is where it's like someone
else's it could look clean but like
might be clean just because like a lot
of you have been going through there and
they take the stuff away yeah like I
don't know man so so that's run out on
that that's run out on that yeah all
right well thank you guys very much for
tuning in we'll see you again next week
same bat-time same no all right on the
but on Friday
let the proper time on the proper
Channel this is the rob proper Channel
yeah okay bye bye alright the intro
outro
are you surprised by results of that a
little actually I thought people would
prefer not to put their hand in pee
water
so that it's Friday maybe some Friday
Friday gotta get down on Friday sometime
take something for the weekend we can
Friday Friday</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
