while I was making that face I didn't
believe him but then he did it so here
we have the game talk pro 2 wireless
gaming headset this particular one is
for ps3 although there is an Xbox 360
version as well so let's go ahead open
this bad boy up and have a look see I'm
gonna talk more about it once we've
actually got it open because with
headsets there's not much to say until I
get a chance to actually put them on my
head and see how comfortable they are
because honestly for me with a gaming
headset what it really comes down to
more than anything else is how
comfortable is this thing going to be
after a couple of hours and I've gotten
pretty good at evaluating how that's
gonna go down so this guy is a wireless
gaming headset it's a console gaming
headset so it's not going to be that
relevant to the PC viewers in the
audience and it includes a rechargeable
lithium polymer battery so that is the
charging cable charges by USB
so that's convenient enough it also
comes with the necessary adapter for ps3
functionality and let's go ahead and get
it opened up actually kind of surprised
that's not bad
so overall build feels fairly solid
we've got a significant amount of
cushioning on the headband here do we
have enough light right now it's the
light in here is kind of funny today
because of the Sun moving and Sun
shouldn't move it should just do what
it's told
so yeah so sorry there's a fair amount
of cushioning here these are clicky
enough that they don't move by accident
but fairly easy to adjust okay so you
can adjust it fairly easily that's good
you've got an adjustable blue mic this
is actually hilariously adjustable look
at this I could put it I could be like
oh wow
I'm wearing this headset and like I need
my mic exactly here and it wouldn't move
I actually love that so you can you can
actually move the whole thing up if you
want and hide it you don't have to for a
second I thought I thought you had to
like bend it like
this is a viewer although you have that
option check this up so you can yeah you
can be like yeah yeah guys okay hold on
a second
my mom's calling me for dinner so I
gotta go amazing right
okay or you can do this so whichever
whichever one looks less dorky to you
probably doesn't make that much of a
difference so let's talk about some of
the features so Sphynx directly to your
ps3 console with no cord or dongle
required we've got the wireless
microphone for online chat sure okay I
actually have a list over there because
I didn't want to forget anything so I'm
just gonna kind of look past the camera
oh it does have built-in noise
cancellation so that's good if you don't
want to actually hear your mom call you
for dinner because you'd rather keep
gaming than plate then play dinner eat
dinner see you can tell I've been there
right play dinner powerful nice
counseling so crystal clear
communication independent controls from
game audio chat volume and digital
special effects speaking of individual
controls uh-huh so here we go there's
your voice chat volume there's your
charging there's your master volume over
here you've got your saying you've got
your power and mute and you have your
effects so digital special effects you
can tailor your preferred sound with
bass boost 3d effects and treble boost
includes affordable batteries we already
talked about that plus and gain talks
universal universal digital digital
audio interface adapter so that's this
guy right here for use with the ps3
allowing HDMI or conventional AV
connections between your console TV with
no additional adapters does this plug
into itself no okay what else are we
missing here I don't think that's it all
right I don't think that's it I think
that's it so base boos 3d effects
trouble boost wireless gaming headphones
it's got an illuminated logo and
dependent controls for great game audio
cool cool cool I think that's pretty
much it when it comes to comfort
actually they've done not a bad job at
all so check this out you've got an
inordinate amount of foam now this is a
fairly hard foam so my feedback about
harder won't wash and say hard foam it's
not hard foam but it's um more more
springy it's not like a memory foam so
what you'll probably find about these
headphones is has been
might not be ideally comfortable at
first but once you've broken them in and
once they've molded to your head a
little bit they will be potentially more
comfortable than one that comes with a
softer foam that always springs back to
its to its full original shape so that's
something to bear in mind it's also got
very very very deep pockets so you can
see it Misha's down a lot so there's a
lot of room for it to break in much like
a pair of shoes your ears should fit in
here as long as you don't have like
pretty huge ears mine do okay so there
you go that's the size of my ears that's
meaningful to you guys at all and check
this out before putting on the headset
turn the game chat and game volume
controls to the lowest level put the
headphones on and slowly adjust the
volume controls to a comfortable ah I
have that's like basically like the hot
warning on the outside of the coffee mug
to me that that's actually amazing
because it's like ya don't accidentally
like if you guys watch my ancient
ancient video on my MTX palm channel
with the beats by dr. dre headphones I
actually accidentally did that they were
like cranked up like really really loud
and I put them on Oh No okay so thank
you for checking out my unboxing your
first look don't forget to subscribe for
more videos like this one about the Deen
talk Pro 2 wireless gaming headset don't
forget it's available for ps3 as well as
Xbox 360 and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
