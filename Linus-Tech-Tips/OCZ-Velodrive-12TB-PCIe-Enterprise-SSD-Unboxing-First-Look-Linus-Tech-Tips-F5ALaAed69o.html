have ever unboxed online as tech tips by
a fairly significant margin I might add
this is the OCZ
V low Drive PCI Express solid-state
drive and what makes this so expensive
is the fact that it is a 1.2 terabyte
yes a 1.2 terabyte SSD pretty cool
featuring SandForce 1565 controllers
that is multiple ones let's go ahead and
get this party started so you can see it
comes in a fairly plain brown box it is
shrink wrapped so we're going to go
ahead and relieve it of its shrink wrap
prison and did it that didn't deter okay
so this is more of an enterprise grade
solution rather than being a
consumer-oriented
so no the expectation from OCZ is not
that average Joe is spending five grand
on 1.2 terabyte SSD for his gaming
system but there is a market for this
stuff so the product does exist let's go
ahead and take off the cover as you can
imagine they don't you know produce a
ton of these so there isn't like a
special box just for the one point two
terabyte SSD let's see what we got
inside here so first we have a low
profile bracket which also includes what
else is in here
some thermal interface material DIY and
a heatsink all right so we've got a
heatsink and a thermal pad oh ok so it
looks like when you put on the low
profile bracket the heatsink is no
longer attached so you have to attach
you have to attach a new one there's
actually ventilation back here so this
must be a pretty toasty card in an
installed scenario okay so next we have
sorry guys my battery died got it
replaced now and here it is
the 1.2 terabyte v low drive so how many
SandForce controllers do we have we have
one two three four so this is a
double-decker PCB much like the Revo
drive three X two products and they are
using Intel NAND okay so we've got what
is this
six twelve chips per controller so I'm
going to go ahead and show you guys the
back so you won't see any controllers on
the back because the controllers for
this PCB are in between okay so what
kind of density is that so these must be
using some of the highest density chips
out there if we have one point two
terabytes so that's equivalent to four
240 gigs now hold on 480 no what are
these things give me a sec you know what
I'm going to confess I actually don't
know exactly what the densities of these
chips are but I can tell you that there
are 12 times 448 chips so basically what
it comes down to is how much spare area
ocz has left so if you guys remember
when the vertex 2 originally launched it
was a vertex 2 50 100 or 200 gig and
then they had an extended version which
actually didn't have any more chips on
it and those were 60 120 and 240 so
depending how much leftover area or
spare area they've left which I would
imagine is quite a bit on an Enterprise
Drive this could be anywhere from the
equivalent of for 360 gig drives up to
for 480 gig drives depending how much
left over they have either way I'm
telling you these are very high-density
chips and this is a very very serious
business controller card so here's that
he think I was talking about before so
right under there is in all likelihood
actually why don't we just why don't we
just find out what's under there give me
a second all right so since this is
obviously meant to be user swappable
we're going to take off that stock
bracket go ahead and move the screws
we've got one more screw here that goes
into that top PCB okay so this is a
$5,000 SSD I'm working on right now
and we're going to find out exactly what
ship that is so that is an LSI chip LSI
SAS - zero zero four I don't know what
controller that is okay fusion MPT I'm
not familiar with this particular piece
right here but I can tell you guys right
now it is made by LSI so unlike the Revo
level consumer level as a PCI Express
SSDs which are generally using sort of a
more of a tier Tier three solution this
is using a Tier one raid solution which
looks like a serious chip in terms of
the horsepower that it's delivering
because you do have to have this cooler
on it you can see the other side this
one has the thermal interface material
pre-applied so that'll show you how you
are intended to assemble the low profile
bracket should you require it has a PCI
Express 8 X interface I don't know if I
mentioned that before so that's giving
you a ton of bandwidth between the
system and the SSD itself and in terms
of specs they actually include almost no
information with the product whatsoever
I guess the assumption is that if you're
buying one of these you already know
everything there is to know about it and
you're fairly certain you need one
because if you're buying a $5,000 SSD
and you end up not needing it I don't
know too many retailers who are going to
be like yeah sure no problems bring that
back full refund no big deal so there
you go this is the OCC V low drive 1.2
terabyte PCIe 8 X SSD you saw it unboxed
