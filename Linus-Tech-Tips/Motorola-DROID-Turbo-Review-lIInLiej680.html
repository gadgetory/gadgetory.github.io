manufacturer has a wicked case of
electronic anorexia we get these hyper
thin phones it seemed content to spend
all day measuring themselves on a scale
and admiring themselves in the mirror
and maybe some people find that sexy but
you know what I see
insecurity weakness and a lack of
stamina none of which makes for a good
night in the sorry what were we talking
about right back on track part two of
our triple curved monitor surround is
coming soon so make sure you're
subscribed to catch that curvy is
beautiful and on that note the Droid
turbo can turbo my droid all night long
if you know what I mean I mean it's
thicker than most flagship mobile
devices because it's got you know a big
internal battery so at night time the
phone is still running that's what I
meant by the all night long I mean what
did you think
the Coolermaster neptune 240m features
an exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more so we'll kick things off with specs
picture in your mind's eye what the
ballin Asst Mart phone specs might be
for a moment basically that a
top-of-the-line Snapdragon 805 Adreno
420 GPU 3 gigs of ram a 5.2 inch AMOLED
quad HD display covered in Gorilla Glass
3 32 or 64 gigs of internal storage
wireless charging AC wireless internal
and exterior nano-coating 4 splash
resistance and a 39 hundred million
power battery
I'm sorry Linus what did you just say
this thing has just about enough battery
capacity to power itself and act as a
battery bank for my buddies iPhone yeah
yeah I did but calm yourself down I'll
talk more about it later let's do the
quick physical overview first at the
back we find the 21 megapixel still
camera that also records all traje D at
24 FPS with its super bright dual
flashes a Motorola logo and one of the
most satisfying material choices that
I've ever encountered on a phone
I mean Gorilla Glass aluminum unibody
blah blah blah blah
the Droid turbos ballistic nylon doesn't
do as much as I expected to improve grip
enos but it's something different it
looks and feels amazing in the hand and
I was even able to clean the pasta sauce
that my two-year-old spill on it without
too much effort
seriously I could have killed him though
anyway on the Left we got nothing on the
bottom microUSB and on the right the
well-positioned but slightly mushy lock
button and volume rocker that doubles as
a nano SIM tray and then finally on the
top a three-and-a-half millimeter jack I
actually prefer this position makes a
little easier to sort of pull the phone
out of your pocket look at something
without getting it caught on stuff which
leads us around to the front the mono
speaker does face forward and it's loud
enough but sound quality is very
unexceptional
fortunately the screen is a different
story now I criticized LG's choice of a
quad HD display in the g3 because I
don't think the miniscule improvement in
display sharpness was worth the
lackluster contrast in that case and I
still don't think a 2560 by 1440 display
is necessary on a smart phone but the
AMOLED display that motor
opted for enables that cool notification
system where only the necessary pixels
are illuminated for previews and gives
the Droid turbos display rocking
contrast that makes it look great even
outside it's not perfect I wish that
minimum brightness was actually lower
for nighttime viewing there's more
motion blur than I'd like when scrolling
and there's a noticeably cool color
shift when you look at it off axis but
after the first couple of days I pretty
much stopped noticing most of those
things something I didn't stop noticing
was the fact that this is the first
Android phone that I've used in over a
year with dedicated capacitive buttons I
don't generally have a preference either
way but I did find that with this phone
holding it in landscape mode was a
little tricky without mashing those
buttons so just watch out for that if
you're picking one up so let's get into
actually using it first the big question
isn't it heavy line is with that massive
battery in it and answer is no the
curvature of the back feels very natural
in my hand and the weight gives it a
satisfying premium feel without making
it feel brick like okay then line a
second question do you actually get 48
hours out of it like Motorola claims
because that'd be sick dog and the
answer here is also no and I'll throw an
eight don't be ridiculous
for good measure I usually ended up with
35 to 40 percent left at the end of the
day and power users will still be able
to drain their battery in a single day
by doing things like playing games or
navigating with GPS I'm even sitting
here writing this at the end of a
workday I'll be at a fairly long workday
with a mere 25 percent left which is
obviously not enough to make it through
another day tomorrow but while two day
battery was a silly claim for Motorola
to make the extra capacity of the Droid
turbo has changed the way that I use my
phone for a single day and switching
back to something with a more normal
battery size will be extremely difficult
I did alter the default two-minute
backlight timeout to one minute that was
just showing off but I was able to keep
all my features on crank that brightness
browse whenever I was bored and I didn't
even bother carrying a battery bank
while I was using it between the Qi
wireless talk in my car and
included 12-volt fast charger that can
restore this much battery in this much
time here's a graph I didn't add it to
my script in a pinch even though I'm
still plugging into a one amp charger
every night to preserve the life time in
my battery I felt liberated somehow
because I'm not thinking about my
battery all the time on the software
there's not much to say it's Motorola's
skin so you get pretty much bone stock
Android
apparently there's a lollipop upgrade
coming very soon which is good because
art runtime is bugged on KitKat on this
phone and then it's got a couple of moto
tweaks including their wave to preview
your notifications their slide to unlock
there's somewhat useless voice control
that I found routed voice commands
through Google now more often than not
which is fine I guess
and there you go it's moto skin one
thing I noticed although it's not
directly related to software was that
whichever keyboard I was using stock
Android or Swift key I am bloody
accurate on the droid turbo the bottom
is a little pointy resting on my pinkies
but the chin bar size is pretty much
perfect to me and I can fly on this
thing which leads us to the most
negative part of this review the camera
is wicked fast to open with one of the
most reliable gesture launch mechanisms
I have ever seen and it takes fantastic
twenty-plus megapixel stills like this
one of my cat rumble with gorgeous
shallow depth of field but the problem
is in the word stills moving subjects
whether you're trying to capture a photo
with the extremely slow shutter lag or a
video with the non optical stabilized
jittery feeling motion that doesn't seem
to be avoidable just don't work that
well for this phone I tried a couple
alternate camera apps and neither of
them helped so all I can do at this
point is hope that Motorola fixes this
with the lollipop update or shortly
thereafter because otherwise it's going
to be a serious mark against this phone
for a lot of people which leads us to
the conclusion for this video it amazes
me that I even have to applaud the
technological innovation of put a bigger
freakin battery in it but that's what
I'm going to do I don't want a lighter
phone my fingers aren't made of you know
spaghetti I want one that works better
and for longer and that's what the droid
turbo does and this why in spite of its
camera its earned its place as my new
daily driver until further notice this
is a great phone and my only other big
complaint is availability its Verizon
exclusive in the US right now and while
the Verizon apps in occasional hey your
SIM isn't Verizon message are easy to
ignore you just plain can't buy one in
the US without a verizon contract right
now which is going to hurt
third-party modder support if you're
into rooting your phones and installing
custom roms and whatnot although this
may be less of an issue outside of the
US where there's a max queue that you
know may be possible to purchase
depending on the region so I think
that's pretty much it guys thank you for
