look at something that we haven't seen
before this is the next star three super
speed external three and a half inch
hard drive enclosure it doesn't include
a hard drive but it is USB 3.0 ready so
that's super speed USB so it goes USB
then the high speed then super speed
okay okay so the maximum transfer rate
is up to five gigabit per second let me
start out by saying that is completely
unnecessary there's no single hard drive
these days that it's gonna take
advantage of that transfer rate but
that's not to say that USB 3.0 transfer
rates are totally unnecessary because
what you could have potentially is a
hard drive enclosure that contains you
know for USB or sorry for USB for hard
drives and you can read me write to all
of them at the same time say for example
in like a raid zero or something like
that so then you'd really need that
extra speed okay so basically USB 3.0 is
about let me think so it's about three
times faster than eSATA which is in turn
about three times faster than USB 1.1 I
believe let me just think so 480 megabit
per second is USB - did I say 1.1 wow
I'm getting very confused here why don't
I just read off the Box to make life
simpler for myself okay so it's
backwards compatible with the USB 2.0 or
1.1 it's hot-swappable so you can plug
in play without rebooting which would be
pretty typical of a USB anything device
okay so maximum transfer is out here we
go so they give us the specs so the
maximum transfer rates are up to 480
megabit per second which means that
almost any hard drive these days is
going to be bottlenecks by USB 2.0
however USB 3.0 at five gigabits per
second is going to be more than enough
for any modern hard drive so it means
that you are getting the full transfer
speed out of your hard drive regardless
of how fast it is so it includes a USB
3.0 cable alright so you can see that
we've got like a standard you do you
recognize this one connector and then
this one is a USB three but this is a
new USB 3.0 standard so that's gonna go
into the back of the external drive then
you have some
he's gonna look at that summer he
couldn't see it well enough before oh
there you go okay yeah that's good
all right and then we've got some
mounting screws okay so these two black
ones go at the back of the unit to
install the the hard drive cage and the
knees for for attaching the hard drive
to the sled okay instruction manual I
just told you everything you pretty much
need to know about how to how to use it
here's a little spin so if you want the
if you want the enclosure just fit on
your desk like this then this is the
little stand for it to sit in okay so
that's pretty straightforward as well
and then next this is gonna be the power
adapter which looks exactly like it did
for the old neck start to or next or
maybe it is a next are three but the old
USB 2.0 u SATA one I have one of these
it's a great little enclosure actually
it's had it for years and it still looks
it even still looks all shiny they've
managed to do a shiny finish that
doesn't attract finger prints too badly
so it looks like the new one the
SuperSpeed next part three they've
obviously dropped the eSATA interface
because eSATA at a hundred and fifty
megabit per second is not nearly as fast
as USB 3.0 at five sorry what is it a
hundred and no no no what it says
Saturday at so the new SATA is three
gigabit per second the old one is 1.5 I
don't know the new one is six ok ok ok
yeah yeah yeah yeah so eSATA is one
point five gigabit per second and this
runs at five so you sad is completely
redundant on something like this it's
all about speed alright so you've got a
power plug here then you've got a power
switch you can see that the unit will
just come apart just like that okay so
this is the sled I was talking about so
you plug the hard drive in this way it
seems to have mounting holes for you to
mount it on the bottom so you plug in
your fort or you screw in your four
screws there alright so let me see this
little header right here this guy right
there you just plug in this one it goes
in either way it actually totally
doesn't matter you just install it one
of the two ways but it fits on there and
then that's gonna power the front
indicator LED so this little van tech
logo here will light up blue ok so let's
have a look at started the unit itself
overall so this just slide
and on these little guides right here
you can see how that fits in just like
that
so I'll just tuck that in there just
like it was before oops
Oh sort of like it was before there we
go okay so you got kind of like a black
shiny somewhat brushed looking finish
can you see that okay in the camera okay
good and then the top is kind of rounded
and then the other side you got the same
thing kind of a nice shiny nice shiny
brushed finish on the metal there then
the bottom looks like that
alright fronts got chrome accents and
whatnot so I think that pretty much
concludes it thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look here at the
next are three super speed black USB 3
hard drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
