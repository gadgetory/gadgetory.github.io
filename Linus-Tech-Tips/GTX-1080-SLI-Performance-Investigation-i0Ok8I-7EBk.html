world of multiple graphics cards but the
pursuit of higher and smoother frame
rates is not one of them if you thought
the performance of one 1080 on its own
was pretty insane this may actually
admit you the cards we will be featuring
for this performance testing will be
dual EVGA GTX 1080 superclocked Edition
cards
helliya
intel Skullcandy nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 processor and
Thunderbolt 3 learn more at the link in
the video description let's start off
with a card shall we the cooler design
is identical to the 1070 Super clocks
that we checked out from EVGA not that
long ago check out that video up here
I'm not personally a fan of the
overabundance of massive text logos but
others in the office are totally a fan
and as it's an aesthetic thing you're
free to pick your poison I will admit
that outside of the logos I really like
the overall style and would say that it
suits modern computer components as a
whole quite well if you're going for a
cohesive component design specs wise it
features a stock 5 +1 power phase design
a single 8 pin power connector 217 watts
of max power draw and a boost clock of
1847 megahertz which surpasses the
founder's editions clock speed of 1733
in terms of connectivity it features a
single HDMI 2.0 connector 3 DisplayPort
1.4 connectors for 4k at 120 Hertz or 8
K at 60 Hertz and a dual link DVI D
connector but enough of that
put down line simple specs and release
the benchmark results in all their
lustrous glory
ok ok whoa there calm calm down when
linked together by the annoyingly
expensive but rather attractive EVGA
high-bandwidth sli bridge with all of
its RGB LED glory the results are rather
fantastic oh and by the way you can turn
off the lights on the little thing by
just moving the switch just between two
of the colors and leaving it there it
just kind of doesn't shine at that point
the DirectX 11 performance in Tomb
Raider and Crysis 3 scaled rather well
considering the intensity of our
settings putting everything above the
highest available preset when possible
and running everything at 4k yes you can
run really intensely hard to run games
at 4k with max settings and achieve
higher than 60fps on average that
happened hell yeah I'm so jacked up
right now but there are issues with this
as you probably expected so before I get
too excited we have to remember that
is a multiple GPU config that we're
talking about and it will inherently
have issues like in hitman where it
barely scaled at all and created massive
framerate drops and stutters there's an
unofficial fix through Nvidia inspector
but it's definitely not perfect either
and has a number of its own issues
then there was running DirectX 12
benchmarks which just didn't scale
because well they couldn't the whole
abstraction layer that is required from
Microsoft before all that fancy new
stuff I mentioned in this wTF is going
on with sli video which you should
really go watch totally isn't ready as
of making this video anyways another
really interesting tidbit has to do with
the affer mentioned sli bridge what if
you don't want to buy an expensive sli
bridge and want to use one of the old
original solid bridges or even the
ribbon cable bridges well we do have
this infographic but are there any
actual performance differences yes
actually and in exactly the order you
would expect which is rather satisfying
the ribbon cable performs the worst the
old solid bridge is slightly better and
the new fancy high bandwidth bridge wins
hurrah and by a noticeable amount might
I add and exactly two fps Delta is
nothing to scoff at it may not be worth
the price to you but it's something to
consider as you may find it offers an
aesthetic improvement as well moving on
we have the power draw and even with two
damn cards running in Crysis 3 the whole
bench only pulled 437 watts from the
wall while the first card ran at 81
degrees and the second card ran at 73
degrees which is pretty cool and to be
fair though that was on an open test
bench impressive overall today we're
highlighting the k7 xx black headphones
of course from Mass drop it still has a
bunch of other cool products which you
can check out on the link in video
description and hopefully you guys
already know about mass drop they're the
company where a bunch of people buy
something all at once which makes the
price go down the more and more people
commit to buying it the ones we're
showcasing in this video are the same as
the ones that last review the last year
and you can check out that full review
up in the video
here do you remember that this is a
limited drop so if you want a pair
you're going to have to act pretty fast
these headphones have large cushiony ear
cups a flat wire voice coil very motion
to layer diaphragm genuine leather
headband memory foam ear pads and velour
covering they have a two year warranty
cover by mass drop and you can order
them outside of the US but a $25 fee
will be assessed for all eternal orders
so if you want to check them out and
grab a pair head over to the link in the
video description down below alright
guys thanks for watching if you liked
the video like it if you just liked the
video disliked it don't forget to get
subscribed or check out the link to the
where to buy the stuff we featured in
this video like these wonderful graphics
cards on Amazon in the video description
also linked in the description is our
merch store which has cool shirts and to
our community forum which you should
totally join so you can discuss stuff
like SLI problems that you will
inevitably have if you have multiple
cards or the awesome performance in like
the two games that you can actually get
it working in anyways check out this
video I mentioned it earlier in the
video but it's the WTF is going with SLI
thing really interesting subject and I
suggest you check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
