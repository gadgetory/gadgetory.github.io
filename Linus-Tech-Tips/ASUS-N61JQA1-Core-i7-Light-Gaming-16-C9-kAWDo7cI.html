unbox another a sous laptop as you can
see the first thing we notice about this
box is that Smart Notebook equals smart
u so this is pretty much saying if you
buy their notebook you are smart okay
also on the front you have that a sous
one 3056 Awards in 2008 good for them
okay and then oh this is great
so this is the a sous accidental damage
warranty which is included in the
purchase price of this notebook it is
not something you have to buy extra
1-year warranty covering accidental
drops spills power surges and fire
damage your laptop gets on fire and you
can still claim warranty support that's
terrific and then after the first year
with the accidental damage warranty you
have their regular global warranty so
that means that you can actually buy
this notebook here in Canada you could
move to somewhere else and as soos would
still cover your warranty even though
it's a Canadian model a lot of
manufacturers won't do that and it's
region-specific
so this is the N 61 JQ and it is
specifically the 2aj x - 2 model okay so
that means we've got included features
are a 16 you know what why don't we just
talk about this as we open up the
notebook that might be a little bit more
efficient I've gone and forgotten a
knife again but that's okay because at
least I have my keys on me today you
know I actually got a YouTube message
this morning that someone wanted to buy
me a knife and send it to me he asked me
for my shipping address and I really
appreciate the kind offer but yeah I I
don't I don't I don't actually need a
handout knife I just need to be more
organized so the first thing I find
inside the box is a power cord okay
pretty blonde standard power cords I'm
not gonna dwell on that too much and
then we have a little cardboard insert
here that protects the notebook I'm
gonna try and find the accessory boxes
first before I take out the notebook
itself okay so these two right here are
the accessory boxes and I'm just gonna
reach down in there and see if I can
fish out some accessories okay then we
have the other business end of the power
adapter so there's your power brick it's
rated for let me see 19 volts 4.7 4 amps
okay so it's a relatively high-powered
notebook just because you do have a
pretty good dedicated video card in it
it's a 57 30 if memory serves and I'm
gonna cheat a little bit here and yes it
is a 57 31 game okay next we've got the
battery which is pretty big I believe
this is a six cell battery okay so you
can see it's gonna be stylized to match
the notebook itself so well install that
battery when we actually get the
notebook out of the box and I can show
you what it looks like with and without
it next we've got a whole bunch of
documentation stuff in here so this
notebook updated information the system
recovery DVD is no longer included in
the product package if you need to
recover your notebooks os refer to the
section using recovery partition in the
user manual for more details you can
also create your own system recovery DVD
should you so desire okay then we have a
bag oh they include an LCD cleaning
cloth that's very nice made up of a
special combination of interwoven micro
fibers as well as a little users manual
Thank You soos next we have the Express
gate manual so if you don't actually
want to bother booting up into your OS
you just need to use your computer
really quick jot a couple notes or use
Skype or go on the internet there's like
a Linux based OS loaded right onto the
computer that you can boot up really
fast next we have a cable tie that's for
your power cable then we have the assist
drivers inutility DVD don't use this you
base it mean it'll come with everything
installed but then you want to make sure
that whenever you reinstall you're
updating with the latest drivers off the
Isuzu website here's the warranty card
yeah they want you to complete this and
mail it to the address register within
60 days and get an extra one year
accidental damage warranty okay so it
looks like you do have to register the
warranty to get that accidental damage
warranty but that is a small price to
pay
considering how much it costs to buy an
accidental damage warranty from most
notebook vendors so let's go back in
there that pretty much does it for
accessories so we'll get the notebook
itself opened up here kind of put the
Box here and then let's have a look at
this notebook so this is a core i5 based
notebook as I recall it is a oh sorry
it's an i7 this is an i7 based notebook
so this is using Intel's latest and
fastest series of notebook CP there we
go and it specifically uses the i7 720
it's got 4 gigs of ddr3 RAM because all
i7 use ddr3 RAM and then as I mentioned
before it has a 40 730 notebook GPU so
it's not the most powerful out there but
it's still gonna provide a decent casual
gaming experience in a very convenient
form factor I mean it's a notebook so ok
so that includes true entertainment real
sound so includes video magic boost DVD
quality to Full HD ok one gig dedicated
graphics memory and symphonic audio
enjoyment I'd be curious to know what
that does
here's another summary of their warranty
which we already went over then we've
got a little keyboard protector inside
here you know a lot of people actually
keep these I was surprised to find that
out around university I would often see
people take this off of their notebook
every time they go to use it because it
keeps you from getting little key shaped
dents in the top of your LCD if you're
carrying it around in a backpack all the
time hey this is cool this notebook has
USB 3.0 I had no idea check that out USB
3.0 is actually implemented into this
particular notebook model you've got GPU
computing three-finger multi-touch
touchpad
so it's gesture already and because it
features Windows 7 which is completely
multi-touch and touchscreen ready there
you're gonna have a lot of extra support
for that next we've got the actual specs
of this notebook which I haven't really
gone over into much detail it's got a 16
inch
HD LED backlit display it's got a 500
gig hard drive I mentioned already 4
gigs of memory 802.11 n so that's
Wireless n as well as Bluetooth DVD
super multi so you don't have support
for blu-ray or HD DVD but you can play
back HD video clips as long as they're
files with the integrated ati mobility
radeon i mean the core i7 could handle
it on its home but whatever it includes
Windows 7 premium and then why don't we
go ahead and have a look at some of the
physical characteristics of this thing
so you've got a glossy top here that has
kind of a patterned this is kind of
interesting it's sort of like a wave or
like blade of grass pattern but they're
using little dots to draw the shapes on
the top of the notebook can you really
see that with the camera no that's
pretty tough to see isn't it can you can
you get it from this angle anyway it's
kind of nice looking it's a little bit
classier than just a plain black and it
should also make it a little bit less
susceptible to showing fingerprints
because you've already got these small
swirly shaped patterns on here so that's
that's a very nice touch around the side
of the notebook we find headphones
microphone USB eSATA the DVD multi
recorder right here another USB and
antennae thingy majiggy there then on
the back we find the battery which I'm
going to go ahead and just quickly
install and that took not very long to
do and then around the other side we
have a Kensington lock power in
ventilation slot VGA out which is you
know what I've had people say why do you
have VGA out on a modern notebook the
reason is that a lot of projectors need
VGA so if you're gonna use this notebook
for any kind of serious business use you
better have a VGA port because the last
thing you want is to have some huge DVI
to VGA dongle hanging out of your
notebook and then it doesn't make sense
so they built in a VGA cost them next to
nothing and it's very convenient for
people who do need that feature gigabit
and then there's HDMI remember if you
need DVI out you can always adapt HDMI
and so many things use HDMI natively
these days it doesn't even matter this
is the perfect output combination in my
opinion got a little Express card there
then you have USB 3.0 port and a
wireless on/off switch
moving around to the front we have an
SDHC card reader just like that and then
let's go around to the bottom where I am
NOT going to show our viewers the
product code for the Windows 7 home
premium included with this laptop the
lapped lamp in this display contains
mercury okay so at the bottom we find
convenient doors to access the important
pieces of hardware inside here so I'm
gonna go ahead and guess that down here
is your memory as well as your wireless
card and in here based on this symbol is
the hard drive they've also got a
technical support phone number on the
bottom so it's a 24 hours seven days a
week except Holidays hotline very nice
and I think that pretty much wraps up
everything that we need to say about the
N 61 J thank you for checking out my
unboxing and you know what that doesn't
quite wrap it up I'm sorry here's the
power button oh I turned it on excellent
and then here is the number man's
telling me to wrap it up because we're
hitting 10 minutes here's the chiclet
keyboard quite comfortable well spaced
out you've got a dedicated number pad
which is great for business use and up
here you've got a couple of media keys
for volume up volume down as well as
play and mute and thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the n61 J</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
