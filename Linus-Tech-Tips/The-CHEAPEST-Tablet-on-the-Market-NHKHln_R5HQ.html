free shipping that only took three days
to run I was pretty good free shipping
well one thing you give up apparently is
spell check because I don't know what
Laurent gray is but I'm pretty sure they
were going for iron here
LTX the first meetup we've done in over
two years go check it out only like 800
tickets remaining
I need like I need glasses can I help
you I just really need them wow those
are strong chapter one
tablets web browser can connect to the
internet via Wi-Fi to satisfy your
business and individual network needs I
mean
shockingly that's more documentation
than Apple provides oh wow look at this
not just keep right off just like that I
don't even need to drop it it's fun what
could we have possibly done to tarnish
your fun I mean huh maybe it's a lady
I often have that effect so what we find
here is uh what is this a quad-core CPU
at one point three gigahertz
a 33 quad core sure gotcha
it's got uh what is this 512 Meg's of
ddr3 RAM from SK Hynix and I'll whopping
eight Meg's of on-board storage
expandable via transflash nobody calls
it transflash I mean this is great look
at this speaker is held in place by
being magnetically stuck to the back of
the display assembly great oh it doesn't
matter you oh it goes Rob though in
terms of user serviceability and you
know I fix it disassembly factor I give
them a ten out of ten here double your
Wi-Fi reception with this easy trick
pull is sticker that also happens to be
your Wi-Fi antenna and just put it up
like that yeah no problem I'm just
talking on this tablet now it doesn't
have a SIM slot don't don't worry about
that
the air gap is so big that you go from
being able to read the battery life
remaining to not being able to read the
battery life for meaning that is really
extreme oh man the tactile feedback on
the power button is completely broken oh
come on um okay should be cheapest okay
flock favorites here we go it's going a
little faster now - maybe just needing a
good it took so long to load that it
went to sleep I almost wonder if we'd
have better luck with the backing off
maybe this is a cooling issue I'm not
really sure what the deal is with a lot
of this okay tree ninja holy crap
nope not bombs come on I've got another
dope AF mod for you kids out there
watching from home you want to improve
speakers you put that right there
Oh YouTube YouTube crashed so to the
tablets credit once we've got the video
playing it's not that bad
let's go ahead and click another video
and how about web browsing
it comes with browser let's just try it
like read it read it is a nice safe
text-based web site Wow Wow
oh so much Wow so I think I've suffered
enough I think you guys have suffered
enough and I think poor young tab has
suffered the lioness treatment enough
here would I recommend buying one of
these for 37 dollars when you can pick
up like a I used to anything else or
something for a little more the answer
is no no I wouldn't and if you were
thinking to yourself gee Linus well you
only showed the gaming and content
consumption and web browsing aspects of
the product what about the camera well
to that I would reply the camera is no
better than you'd expect so while it
does include a screen protector I would
pause it that there's nothing in the box
that's worth more than this screen
protector thank you for checking out
this episode of the cheapest X anywhere
this is the yin Tab tablet for $37
shipped and I will see you next time
it's funny you think phone companies
you'd phone them and someone would pick
up the phone and you could talk on the
phone but no you talked to robots well
not with ting ting is the mobile carrier
that is focused on customer satisfaction
and what's more is they do this without
charging an arm and a leg
the average ting bill is only 23 bucks a
month per device because they only
charge for what you use and they've got
lower mobile data rates across the board
it's just ten bucks a gig beyond the
first gig so head over to Linus ENCOM
they've got this handy dandy calculator
and you just enter your last few bills
and how much you paid for them and it
spits out whether you'll save money on
ting they'll even cover 25% of your
cancellation fee if you're stuck in a
contract up to 75 bucks and when you use
our link you'll get an additional $25 in
service credit or towards a new device
so thanks again for watching if you guys
