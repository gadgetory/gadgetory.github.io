that I rerun Vantage with the physics
set to run on the GPU so I have done
just that you can see the CPU score has
shot up quite a bit and the overall
3dmark score is quite a bit higher on
the Quad SLI rig so thank you for that
tip I just I don't know why but I
disabled it for some reason and then I
never never re-enabled it so that
definitely fixed up that issue for me
and I also had someone saying my room is
really messy here and III guess I
apologize for that but I don't think any
of the stuff in here is really stuff
that I can throw away so yeah
reducing clutter is not always as easy
as you might think oh here's a quick
teaser for something that I have
upcoming and got a couple of these in
the mail let's see if I can zoom in so
you can read that yeah so I'll be
hopefully doing a tech tips episode
comparing those against some other
notebook drives and desktop drives and
that'll be a lot of fun what else do I
have in here that's interesting well
nothing really a charger for my for my
plane yeah ok well there I'm documenting
what is my supposed mask on my wii fit
balance board that
now obviously sits in a corner unused
yeah we fit</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
