about this unboxing is - why are you
unboxing a network switch could there
possibly be anything more boring to do
an unboxing video of and the answer that
I might give you is a yes there is
something that could possibly be more
boring to do an unboxing about and I'm
actually going to do one about this hard
drive okay so so yes there could be
something more more boring and the other
question of why am i doing an unboxing
in the networks which actually I don't
know if I ever posed that question but
why am i doing this is because this is a
green network switch so green net
technology reduces power consumption by
up to 70% how does it do that well one
of the ways it does that is it uses
energy-efficient parts okay so this is a
trend net te geez si DG it's an 8 ports
which one of the other ways it does it
is even if you have only two ports
plugged into an older switch it's
actually going to be powering all of the
ports this guy as part of their green
initiative does not even send power to
the ports that are not being used or
sends very very very little so you can
reduce power consumption that way by not
actually powering the ports that aren't
being used you can build a high
performance energy efficient gigabit
network in minutes probably less than
minutes probably about a minute if all
the computers are close together and you
can like unplug your old switch and then
plug in all the other ones quickly it
has a sturdy metal construction with
plug-and-play installation and it is
powered by an energy star-qualified
adapter for a better environment very
nice
ok so haha delivers less power to unused
ports they're gonna explain it all for
me
delivers less power when devices are off
hey so if that computers off it delivers
less power and delivers less power with
shorter cable link let's look at that so
if you have a shorter cable length it
will just deliver less power and if you
have a longer one hey it can deliver
more power - whereas a regular switch
will give full power to every cable
length that you have attached to it so
that is what green net is all about
let's take this guy out and have a quick
look at it and the in front that has a
pretty good reputation for switches so
you can rest pretty much assured the
performance is going to
be good and there's not much to worry
about as far as that goes comes before a
little rubber feet that you can install
on the switch should you so desire
here is your energy star-qualified AC to
DC adapter okay it is made by leader
Electronics Inc and it is capable of
providing one amp at 7.5 volts so there
you go here's a quick installation guide
that probably shows you something along
the lines of how to plug a power plug in
and have it plug in Ethernet cable
inside I don't think you're too
interested in that and then we'll have a
look at the switch itself so it's quite
heavy because it does have a metal
casing I really like the look of try
nuts new products I don't know if you
remember their goofy old blue plastic
ones but these look much better you got
a nice little green stripe so that
indicates a green product from TRENDnet
regardless of what kind of casing it's
using if it's got that green then you
know it is a green networking product
well here is the gigabit switch model
number here is the power indicator here
is the link indicator for all of the
ports on the back as well as an
indicator light to show you just what
speed they're connected at so if they
use the standard scheme it's probably uh
I'm just guessing here but it's probably
green for Fast Ethernet and orange for
Gigabit Ethernet and I really hope
that's right here's the overall specs by
the way guys I hope that was interesting
all right then we have some wall
mounting thing down here at the bottom
then we have some ventilation holes on
the sides and ventilation holes on the
other side and the business end of
things so we have one two three four
five six seven eight gigabit ethernet
ports one DC power in and that pretty
much covers it thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the TEG
sa D G green net switch from TRENDnet
