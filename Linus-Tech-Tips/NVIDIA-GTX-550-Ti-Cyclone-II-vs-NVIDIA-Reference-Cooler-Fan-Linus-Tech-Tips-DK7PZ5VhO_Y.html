temperatures and acoustics of the gtx
550 TI I'll be testing the cyclone to
edition of the card against the
reference and video designed edition of
the card so the first one I have here on
the bench is the reference card so our
maximum temperature ignore this is
actually 75 degrees and it looks like it
takes us about 1950 rpm or about
forty-nine percent fan speed in order to
achieve that temperature so I'm going to
get close and i'll let you guys have a
listen and then i'm going to switch to
the cyclone two and see how much msi's
cooler improves the thermals and noise
characteristics of this video card
well it looks like this is where we
settle for the cyclone to cooler the max
temperature is around 63 degrees so that
makes it a good 10 plus degrees cooler
than the reference design however it is
louder at these settings than the
reference cooler was so we're actually
at a fan speed of about seventy one
percent about seventy percent exactly 71
percent and that is a fan rpm little
ground 3000 RPM so to give us that GPU
temperature we are paying a bit of a
price in terms of noise so what a
messiah is done is they have actually
set a more aggressive fan profile than
nvidia had set on their reference card
through the bios now one of the other
things to note about these two cards is
that besides the GPU temperatures you
can see right here the MOSFETs do not
have any additional cooling on them
right in there whereas on the MSI card
there's actually a metal heatsink
covering the VRMs now that is very hot
to the touch and I gotta say I would be
more comfortable with a card that has
act or has even passive cooling on the V
RMS and then incidental air flow as well
versus one that is only counting on
incidental airflow from the fan to cool
the V RMS now one thing I'm gonna do
before we finish this up and this is
kind of a new thing is I'm going to
tweak the fan on the cyclone to to be
around the same rpm as the stock fan and
see what kind of temperatures we get
with a similar speed similar fan speed
and similar noise profile so I actually
got a far more desirable result than I
had expected if we relax our GPU fan
just by manually setting the speed so
I've set it to forty-five percent and
that is around 1500 rpm we get 75 degree
low temperatures in furmark and I mean
so I'm turning off the cpu can hear that
gives us an almost silent experience
compared to the reference cooler at the
same temperature so the cyclone to
definitely
does a better job than the reference
cooler weather we're looking at silent
performance or whether we're looking at
sheer performance when you go to the max
to see what it can do so why don't we
just see how loud it is at maximum
volume just for fun and thank you for
