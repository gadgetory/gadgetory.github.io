exciting to many general consumers but
for me personally since I often work on
the go and I definitely appreciate the
value of multiple monitors I don't know
if you guys have ever seen any of the
videos where I'm in my office but in my
office I have four monitors so one of
the major disadvantages to many of
working on a laptop is not having dual
screens because I can have a mouse I can
have an add-on keyboard but well excuse
me sorry I can't have a mouse and out on
keyboard isn't that easy but I can make
myself fairly mobile and fairly
comfortable except carting around the
monitor usually isn't really an option
so here we have a monitor CD users guide
and installation files although I
definitely recommend downloading the
latest from Lenovo I'll say yeah this is
a Lenovo product I should have mentioned
that there's also a bit of a QuickStart
guide each type thing going on here so
we'll go through that when we get a
little bit more information about the
product itself this looks like some kind
of a stand okay so there's a stand it's
got some instructions for how it might
work don't forget the USB cable it says
okay we've also got the aforementioned
USB cable so this is a dual USB a two
single USB B and there's a good reason
for that which I'll cover in a moment or
saab rather mini mini B mini B yeah baby
okay and finally we have the monitor
sound so huh there you go so what is
this for what is a what is a monitor in
this particular form factor good for you
might ask and I would say that is a very
good question let me go ahead and answer
it for you so this is a secondary
display for your notebook that connect
hold on a second now I'm having trouble
but I've got so many accessories going
on here that connects via USB it is not
only USB powered but it is also here you
can adjust the the angle to be even with
that stand on the back to be even with
the angle of your notebook but it is
also USB a USB display so you don't need
any kind of external output on your
notebook whatsoever in fact if you do
want to output to a projector or
something like that at a meeting then
you can still do that so that's why it
has two USB ports one of them is for
power although they aren't labeled one
of them is for power and one of them is
for data so go ahead and plug this in
and plug this in to the monitor itself
so that goes in right about there okay
actually I should give you guys a closer
closer look at they actually give me a
second
for convenience sake I actually did use
the disk sorry guys basically the quick
set-up guide is probably not even quite
as simple as the actual process so you
power on your laptop they actually
include that as a step you put the disk
in the thing and then you plug the USB
things into the other USB things and
then you adjust the brightness and
that's pretty much all of them you can
put it away when you're done so I
discovered a couple of other things
while I was setting it after one is that
the case for it so that's the case that
you use to store the unit when you're
transporting it to make sure the screen
doesn't get damaged also has little
ridges right here which allow you to
easily adjust the angle and have it not
accidentally slip up so it's rubber
tipped plus there's a groove there so it
is not going anywhere and I would
suggest that it's probably usable even
without the actual the actual scan one
of the other things that I did was I
found out the resolution of the display
so this is a 1366 by whatever that is
1366 by 768 widescreen display the
brightness is highly adjustable I
apologize Windows is not genuine this is
not true it's genuine Windows well it's
sort of true because it's genuine
Windows but it's I changed my hardware
all the time which is
technically not allowed but I'm not
gonna I mean I just changed the SSD in
here and that's why I deactivate it so I
keep changes so here we go
so we're set up it's pretty much that
simple I can show you guys the
brightness adjustments obviously
something to bear in mind about this
display so right about here
obviously something to bear in mind
about this display is if you're running
an off battery power it's going to
significantly impact your battery life
because it runs not only the power from
the display off USB but also the data
check that out you've got a wide range
of brightness options but the increase
in productivity is probably gonna more
than make up for it so in case you guys
don't know you can adjust it like this
to make sure that you're here we go just
like that to make sure that your mouse
when you move it over between the two
displays doesn't take that huge leap of
faith so how's the responsiveness of it
you can see that frame rate is not as
good as it is over here because instead
of using the GPU to accelerate the
windows effects we're using well there's
the slow mode data rate here and I'm the
USB graphics controller so bear that in
mind as well
although for productivity it is awesome
because I can throw this here I can you
know go look at something here I can
make notes over here I can adjust this
as I see fit in a very convenient
fashion this is a very cool product I'm
just going to show you guys how simple
it is to disconnect so you do that your
laptop goes oh that's not connected
anymore you fold up this back piece I
mean the tooling is exceptional as we've
come to expect from anything made by
Lenovo it's just outstanding like even
though it's so thin it's about the
thickness well okay my iPhone comparison
is no longer working now that I have
this clunky battery case on it is about
the thickness of an iPhone in the thin
parts just like that you can see that
and but this just it has a very solid
overall feel to it inspite of that so
I'm going to go ahead and see if I can
figure out how this goes in here there
we go just clamps in there like that
protects the front of it simply a cool
little product so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the
think vision extra monitor for a laptop
USB powered USB display very neat
product don't forget to subscribe to
