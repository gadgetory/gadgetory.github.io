static pressure series of fan so you can
see I've got a couple dual packs here of
the high performance Edition and the
quiet Edition now the only difference
between a high performance Edition fan
and a quiet Edition fan is the RP the
stock rpm at which it spins at 12 volts
so here let's go ahead and now I talked
a lot about this in the flow series fan
the AF series fans unboxing but it
remains relevant here so I will continue
to talk about it
where has Corsair innovated when it
comes to fans because it's a very
crowded market everyone in there dog has
a line of fans and what they think is
interesting about it so of course there
has done a number of things first of all
they have gone the route of some of
their competitors who have different
fans that are optimized for different
things to Noctua for example has their
pressure optimized p-series fans as well
as their directed air flow and pressure
optimized at series fans
okay so Corsair has SP and then they
also have AF series there we go you can
see they use very very different designs
so that's one of the ways to innovate is
you create fans that are properly
optimized for the different usage
scenarios you think your users will
encounter this one for pressure they
have also added something that I think
is really cool too you just use a
screwdriver to pop the ring off or you
can do it with your hands if you want
and you can replace it with red or white
whatever color you prefer whatever color
you think will accent your rig the best
I mean I hope Corsair comes out with
even more colors in the future because
that just looks like the bee's knees
in my personal humble opinion okay what
else can you do you can improve
aesthetics right all black cables all
black connectors Corsair is already very
good at that very clean-looking hobb
designs I mean I hate ugly fans I hate
good-looking fans that then have like a
big body sticker on the back of them
just drives me crazy
you can do that you can reduce vibration
so they've used a very unique design
here where they've got rubber here
rubber here so rubber on both of the
outsides rubber filling in the entire
inside of what would normally be an open
open corner fan and then but you can
still access the insides in case you
need to run a bolt through it or
whatever else the case may be so I think
that's really cool because they've
reduced vibrations from every possible
angle on their add their new series both
syriza's of fans I think double packs
are actually more cool than people give
them credit for because you can save a
couple bucks just by getting a double
pack and quite honestly who needs one
fan in the first place so let's talk
about the applications what are the
pressure fans for if you have something
like a case with a very reflective front
panel so if you don't have a mesh front
panel like for something like you know a
Corsair 300 or where it's very open
front panel you have something that's
more like a 650d you might want to opt
with a pressure series fan if you have
something like a coarser h100 see how
restrictive that is how little actual
space there is for the fan to push air
through well if you were to use an
airflow Series fan it would be and I
mean this is okay this is not very
technical this is like very surface okay
guys it would be very leaky so to speak
so it would try to push the air through
try to use these very scoopy very flat
propeller like blades to push the air
through it but it would leak it would
spit air back up through the fan which
reduces the efficiency and reduces how
much airflow you actually get through
your radiator and fan noise basically
goes up in a linear fashion with our PM
the faster you spin your fan the louder
it is so if you have to waste cycles
spinning faster in order to push the air
through you're just going to have a
noisier experience whereas with their
pressure series fans you can see they
have a much broader and lower lower
count of the propeller blades so what
that means is that when they spin
they're more of a constant downward
pressure as opposed to moving through as
much air if they were in a completely
open environment like this so that is
why these are optimized for high high
pressure applications such as this where
there's a lot of restriction or
resistance to the flow of air so there
you go that is why there are two
different sir
of fans that is what Corsair has done to
innovate and I think that pretty much
covers it so thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look at Corsairs
static pressure SP series of fans and
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips for more unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and don't forget
every fan includes three different rings
so you have white blue and red you
configure your fan the way you want to
corsair has done a lot of engineering a
lot of testing to make these fans what
they believe are going to be pretty much
the best option out there so uh once we
have some more time to spend with our
data hopefully we'll be able to back up
that conclusion don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from on
boxing's reviews and other computer
videos sorry guys I forgot to show the
accessories that are included for black
screws gotta love those nice little
finishing touches from Corsair again all
black wires blacks leaving black
connectors nice little finishing touches
they also have a little thing about not
returning the product to the store and
contacting Corsair as well as of course
our solutions guide showcasing their
different products because at this point
they have so many products that you
could almost build an entire PC with
nothing but like Corsair Intel and then
I suppose you need like a motherboard
and a graphics card or something</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
