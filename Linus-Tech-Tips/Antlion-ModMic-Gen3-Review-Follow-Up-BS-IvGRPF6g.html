now to learn more at long last here it
is finally guys personal rig update
number 60 and no I'm just kidding this
is my mod mic follow-up so when I
originally unbox the mod mic which is
the detachable microphone that you can
put on the side of any headphones as you
guys will probably know if you've been
watching me for any period of time I'm
not a huge fan of most gaming headsets
because generally speaking they skimp on
the actual audio quality in order to
tack a mic onto them
so what I often recommend people do is
use a pair of headphones in this case
these are sennheiser HD 5 v 5s which i
used to use and use something else as a
microphone such as a blue desktop
microphone or the mod mic this is the
rev 3-1 now aside from promising a
follow up back when I did the unboxing I
also made some mistakes when I did the
original unboxing I didn't really
configure it right so for example this
this little clip right here is actually
for clipping to the mod mic itself to
reduce stress on the cable not for
clipping to the cord of your other
device so I would actually recommend
doing that in some other way I also
didn't really configure it correctly in
terms of the positioning you want to
make sure you get things right
beforehand you don't want to kind of
like bend it too much and then unbend it
and rebend it and other than that that
was sort of most of the problem the good
news is you have a second chance because
they do include another little magnetic
piece so you can always kind of Rika
jigger it yourself and so I never
provided that audio sample that I
promised to provide because that was the
big question from people is ok there's a
solution where I can have better sound
for myself but what about the people on
the other line
so for those guys the good news is the
mod mic rev3 does have a list of sound
cards that it works with the bad news is
some onboard audio solutions in
particular it is not compatible with so
when I found out where we were getting
an AC Xonar Phoebus which happens to be
on the list of approved sound cards
which you can check out on their website
which is linked in the video description
I was like oh that's great now I'll be
able to do my mod mic follow-up and then
I didn't really bother trying
find another solution but this sat in
the kitchen for like two and a half
months while we were prepping and
working on and planning and I didn't
unbox it yet and then we were doing our
extreme overkill buyer's guide etcetra
etcetra etcetra until finally then it
sat on my desk for a little while longer
until I finally installed it in my work
computer and recorded the test audio
clip so without further ado the mod mic
the most compelling social media
cataract is to truly comprehend the
expansive landscape from an editorial
viewpoint during an aspiring potatos
early career so there you have it guys
it slices it dices it allows you to
transfer it from one pair of headphones
to another you can actually get
additional little Clips if you want I
know they're working on a rav4 that's
gonna be even better you can put it up
like this you can put it down like that
you could put it down here like this but
I wouldn't really recommend it because
you're gonna get a lot of like throat
vibration and anyway corner of your
mouth is the correct position and there
are lots of other correct positions too
it's all about personal preference thank
you for checking out this follow-up
video on the mod Mike from antlion
don't forget to subscribe to - tech tips
for more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos don't forget to like
this video if you liked it or dislike it
if you disliked it I've got some people
that are upset and think that I'm in a
bad mood because I say I don't care if
you like or dislike the video no I
actually don't care because YouTube
doesn't care I get exactly the same
boost in my search rankings and all
those other good things if you like or
just like the video because they only
care about engagement so I hope that
clears that up speaking of engagement
leave a comment on the video let me know
what you thought about this and if you
really think that I am on my period
right now it's very possible we'll never
know ok
I'll hit the button at some point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
