disappointment with the video I uploaded
last time around where I said someone
wrote in and asked me if you can run
applications on the touchscreen over
here while you are gaming on your non
touch monitor so I got my touchscreen
monitor on my left I've got my non touch
monitor on my right here so you can man
this thing sucks there we go so you can
see this is not a touch screen this is a
touch screen and that is how the road
was meant to be so let's launch a full
screen game and find out if I can be
gaming over here and I can have some
kind of other random application running
over here at the same time that I can
use my touch screen to interact with it
I personally kind of doubt it but since
I had someone write in and ask I figured
I might as well figure it out and we'll
be back in a moment
apparently we need to download net you
think windows 8 wouldn't come with that
by now but whatever right
so I'm back and I have a false false
three full screen gaming application
running right now I can go ahead and
shoot my gun at stuff so I haven't
tested this yet we're all gonna find out
at the same time I'm gonna give you guys
the up-close view of what's going on and
we've got my article over here on the
NHL CPA agreements oh it looks like full
screens not gonna work okay let's try
gaming in windowed mode on the other
monitor and see if that helps us alright
so we're back in windowed mode that's
kind of disappointing cuz I was really
hoping maybe it's just I guess it's just
a limitation of how things work but I
was really hoping we could have a full
screen application running and then we
could have like an auxilary display
whether it's a full sized desktop
display like this or
it's like a smaller one that sort of
sits here or something like that with
Windows 8
that's touch enabled so that you can
actually use your computer while you're
using your computer for something else
so now that we've got the game running a
window mode you can see I've got my game
running in the windowed mode I'm
shooting at the boats and somehow a
crossbow breaks a boat or whatever and
now I should be able to read my article
and sort of oh no it's gonna need me to
click back on my game again in order to
get that going so basically guys it
works exactly the same way as actually
here maybe I should give you this yeah
I'm gonna give you a close up treatment
so see see it works it works oh oh oh it
doesn't work it doesn't work until I
click it once again I know I'm just
playing with my new camera so if I'm
sorry you guys but basically it works
exactly the same way it used to where
you'll lose focus on the full screen
application just like you would if you
click the mouse outside of a full screen
application on previous versions of
Windows so thank you for checking out
this little blog video and - tech tips
and don't forget to subscribe and if you
have any questions about this phenomenal
jacket that I'm wearing feel free to
post them in the comments where I will
completely ignore them because you guys
should already know pretty much every
Canadian has a jacket like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
