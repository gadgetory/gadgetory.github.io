possessed and least used things for
people building computers is a magnetic
parts tray one of the most abundant
things in the computers world are dead
hard drives this is actually an equation
that we can solve
kula masters new master keys Pro L and
Pro s keyboards feature sixteen point
seven million color RGB backlighting
genuine Cherry MX switches and an
industry-leading ARM Cortex processor
learn more at the link in the video
description we build computers all the
time that's kind of like literally our
job one of the downsides to this is
having a huge amount of hardware boxes
for hardware that are missing screws
because someone was careless and didn't
keep track with them properly okay to be
fair in most cases that was probably me
because of that the three sides of my
personality are all in unanimous favor
of Linus who grabbed a load of magnetic
parts trays in the past he even featured
them in a handy tech under 100 episode
three which you can check out up here
these were great but he bought them when
we worked in a house and had a company
of about six people now we work in a big
office and employ like 13 people I
actually have no idea does that make me
a bad manager probably that's fair what
it doesn't do is ruin my passion for
honestly just screwing around with
hardware and today's victim was well you
guessed it the hard drive and what will
my dead harddrive sacrificial body be
used for in the absence of its ability
to hold memories well we're going to
tear the thing apart carefully actually
and then we're going to extract some
neodymium magnets to make our own parts
trays with well to be honest some tape
and any random object we can actually
get our hands on you're going to need a
small Torx screwdriver the size of which
will be determined by the hard drive
that you have I recommend getting some
form of kit because just scrapping for
different hard drives I ran into two
different sizes of screws I would also
recommend that you get a flathead
screwdriver or a pry bar to pry the top
off and now that that's out of the way
here we go unscrew all the visible
screws on the top and then try to find
the sneekybeeky screws they decided to
hide under stickers or the drive
information sheet
once you're done removing all of these
pry the top of the freaking hard drive
off now that you're on the inside you
can start by removing the first magnetic
plate you're gonna have to pry it off
it's very unlikely that there will be
any screws attached to this next up you
can move on to the
actuator or the platters depending on
whichever is easiest for you this can be
a little frustrating as there's tons of
little screws and different things
overlapping each other but it won't take
all that long and once you're done
removing all of that it's time to work
out the bottom magnet which should just
be a couple screws and some prying away
from freedom now for today's video we're
going to be using the magnets so we're
definitely going to keep those but if
you have a lot of hard drives especially
you should consider selling their
individual components for scrap
especially the metals inside of the hard
drive and the PCB that's on the bottom
of the drive they can all be sold not
for a ton of money mind you but if you
have a lot of drives with a little bit
of time you can turn a profit check out
board sort comm if you're interested in
that alas our magnets have been
retrieved and we're ready to start
making our magnetic parts trays the more
magnets you get the larger the surface
area you can effectively use as a
magnetics parts tray also naturally the
creation of these parts trays will come
down to your creativity but some of my
favorite ones that I made in the office
where the stealth which is a hard drive
that is actually a magnetic part
straight you just take all the guts out
put the magnets on the bottom of the lid
tape them on and then screw everything
back together so it looks like a hard
drive I know I'm kind of weird don't
worry about it another one was the more
practical repurposed box which
originally had a Space Pen in it I just
taped the magnets to the bottom of the
outside of the box this one has the
added practicality of being able to be
magnetically stuck to other metals like
a normal magnetic parts trick and last
but not least is taking a piece of
cardboard drawing out a grid with like a
sharpie or something and then taping the
magnets in a grid formation in order to
create a magnetic sorting pad sick is
this remotely useful at all I think so
but what do I know you tell me hit me up
on Twitter Luke underscore la fr and let
me know if you've made one of your own
tunnel there is the easy to use VPN app
for mobile and desktop that lets you
tunnel to up to 20 different countries
allowing you to browse the internet and
use online services as if you're in one
of those selected countries they have
apps for iOS Android PC and Mac and they
also have a Chrome extension the apps
are
super easy to use which is the main
reason why I suggest tunnel there you
just pick a country in the app turn
tunnel bear on and watch as this truck
and a bear tunnel you all the way to
your new location when you pick a
country and turn tunnel bear on two
things happen your connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and your public IP address gets switched
so you show up as if you're in that
country which is kind of the main point
tunnel bear handles all the mess in the
background and they also give you 500
megabytes of data for free so you can
try it out no credit card required and
if you want to upgrade to an unlimited
data plan you can save 10% by going to
tunnel Vericom /l TT but regardless if
you liked the video like it if you just
liked the video dislike it get
subscribed if you haven't done that yet
I like we've been around for a while man
just guys if you want a shirt you can
get one at the links in description
below if you think that little not that
hard comment was me being a dick you can
go watch our other channels like tech
wiki and channel super fun because those
are a little bit more interesting in
terms of the educational or the fun side
of things this one is like mix I really
know how that works
