today we have Microsoft Project Scorpio
better known as Xbox 1x yes so um we got
through we had this lovely shipping
label yeah it's very good maybe there's
something more exciting on the inside
though are we gonna come down no no I
was wrong Oh check this out
and this it okay this is the unboxer
kind of kind of coming out here but this
is an entirely new trick that I've never
seen before
look at this no no no no we're focused
on the Box right now is unboxing video
okay it's not about the Xbox one axis
about the box oh but it is about the box
because it's an Xbox oh why did I invite
you I don't know right I actually know
so John has actually been doing our
console content for a while now you may
know him best as our writer / sometimes
host for tech quickie you did the
PlayStation 4 Pro I did and you did the
Xbox one as the one before this and the
Xbox one s as well so John every once in
a while makes an appearance as a writer
over on LTP and so he's gonna be the one
covering this but check this out the
printing is only on the inside of the
box you notice that yeah because when
this came into the office I was sitting
here thinking oh the outside box is just
like this ugly shipping car and it'll be
he'll be something more in true like
actually inside of it but it's not like
nicely lined with the Xbox 1x Brandi I
want to know you know what I think how
sighs look at this look at that okay
here's what happened see how this is
plain and this is not they were gonna
ship them like this and then they
decided not to because they probably
didn't want the shipments getting stolen
I bet a hundred bucks really is how the
box was suppose
for the review units because you can see
right there that was designed to sit on
the outside whoa
see but then they probably didn't want
couriers leaking to the press that Xbox
1x shipments were going up and they were
like so some someone probably caught
this like someone at the agency probably
designed this box and then someone at
Microsoft probably went holy crap we
can't do this yet could you imagine
someone just like dumping this on our
doorstep well they don't do that but
imagine if they did think about it a lot
of influencers like especially youtubers
and are just people working out of their
homes yeah exactly and so back when we
were working out of my house that would
happen yeah that happened oh yeah yeah
because honestly we preferred it that
way because FedEx from UPS like all
those guys they just knew who we were
yeah they knew we were constantly
getting this crap and they knew that
like we'd get it so they would just like
leave stuff yeah they wouldn't wait for
it would take the way to have you have
to come back later and have you sign no
because to do that so so I'm actually I
have already gotten all the excitement
that I needed out of this video ok we're
done that's it Xbox one next time boxing
ok Dennis hey did we ever do an unboxing
of our tech quickie yearbook did we ever
put social um we did post it on social
but there was no video unboxing so
spoiler alert content coming maybe we
can we can do a quick throw it on like
Twitter or something at least like a
video we'll do it we'll do it stay tuned
for that but back to this we have this
nice Xbox one X book it was it's nicely
textured as Dennis is pointing out with
his fingers um so oh ok we have a little
loan you have a little look at me I'm
guessing ok making eyes may be the
making of the Xbox here or maybe this is
just a stylized sort of way for them to
present it on this like industrial
looking machinery here and ok ok it's
like a local guy oh this guy it looks
like it is reviewers guy yeah
well that's good because I don't know
anything about it
well here's what I can tell you so the
chip inside of it is an AMD chip it's
eight cores it's um it was Jaguar based
right
I'm not sure I think that's right though
um 2.3 gigahertz um it as far as a PC
GPU equivalent it's not entirely clear
um sigh I've heard kind of maybe like
the GTX 1060 kind of like an Rx 480 or
or 580 maybe but um okay it's not quite
clear but what is clear is it's the most
powerful thing we've seen yet in the
living room does it has 12 gigs of gddr5
so no HD on or anything like that but it
should be more than enough for a console
um the big selling point here is it does
feature um
4k at native 60fps if any of you guys
watched our ps4 Pro review that did have
some 4k games but it was a lower frame
rate that did run natively but it wasn't
a 60 so so this is interesting one of
the one of the four things oh my god
faster CPU and more women didn't faster
GPA or facially check this out
a 50% faster harddrive only using before
that isn't that the first one well that
comes up they were probably using a
basic 5400 rpm Drive if I recall
correctly I could kick more console
oriented people please correct me if I'm
wrong on that one but I don't know how
much I can and can't reveal about the
trip that I made yesterday I can say I
was at monolith productions so there's
that I what else what else can I say you
know what I can say that a faster drive
would help load higher resolution
textures more quickly yeah absolutely
even like now this is irrelevant for a
lot of people anymore even on a PC if
you're going from 54 to is say 200 rpm
or a drive if you're not stepping up to
an SSD either so deftly
performers there okay so it comes with
Assassin's Creed origins oh yeah oh yeah
the decent videos Neal and adventures I
am so Oh FIFA 18 game my kind of game
there we go holy
I play great thing I should played the
force of seven demo for PCs a beautiful
game so I want to see how look seriously
yeah all of these oh yeah these are the
guys we we've visited yesterday yeah wow
that went to two super Lucky's tale oh
I'm totally down to play that
thank you for repositioning that oh oh
I'm totally down to watch that we should
do some after work screenings of planet
Earth - we just put a 4k projector in
the boardroom done done we're doing this
yes after work screaming what a mess we
do it up big and LMG it's like this Suns
a documentary but it has like beautiful
cinematography yeah yeah and it's
narrated by David Attenborough so it's
like and he's a big it's just it's it's
so soothing to watch actually like
you're like animals are like tearing
each other apart but you're just like
you're like this oh this is like so
easily an eagle axing I'm so content to
watch this animal get ripped apart by
this why I haven't seen it yet have you
no no I have Taryn said it's really good
Tara Tara will know you will know what
you okay now now we have to consult
itself so okay so we're Kay blu-ray 4k
Ultra HD HBR so that's the that's the
big stuff here is 4k 60 may the 4k 60p
native 4k 60 at high dynamic range and
apparently some games will even support
multi Atmos so yes I think is first it
does have spatial sound and if you guys
are familiar with Dolby Atmos shambles
plug there's a tech wiki on it but the
gist of it is it encodes I can't bring
you anywhere if he think O's um sounds
as objects instead
to the channel so when they move around
the room it's a little bit more precise
and you know that isn't more realistic
sense of space you get with the sound so
okay so game cast on Xbox Live Gold so
that's pretty cool okay why is this
going to take out the accessories I'm
gonna fetch Bo see this box isn't nearly
as exciting I was so amped to discover
like the secret story behind that other
box this one is white on all sides it's
just a plain white box although
interesting fact it actually does cost
significantly more to get a white box
and then significantly more again to get
one that's white on both sides little
things you don't think about until you
try to package something you know and if
there's anyone who knows packages I'm
sure so well siz in the accessories box
there - y'all gonna troll there okay we
have to kill to get that controller oh
we got some cable HDMI cable and a power
cable so that's a this is quite heavy
it's a little bit cleaner look than the
Xbox one s which is the previous
iteration yeah very like curvy looks a
little more consumer deal the Xbox one s
was actually quite rectangular but all
the top at how like the air vents but
this is like just it's a completely
smooth look very minimalist on the
outside you see the front you got like a
got a eject button here an IR receiver
um over here we have a USB port that's
kind of everyone saying drop it but you
guys that's John it's not me John does
no prob stuff I try not to draw things
so let's uh spin off to the back here we
can look at some of the i/o so power on
the Left the couple of HDMI ports in and
out there so if you have like a
satellite or cable TV set-top box you
want to plug in you can um a couple of
USB 3.0 ports there there might be 3.1
I'm not sure but they're super speedy
they're probably 3.0 if I had to guess
for a console yeah and I are out and in
fact heatsink an optical out Jack in the
Ethernet port
oh yes and if you look inside that vent
there there is a very very hefty looking
heat seek there I'm guessing that's how
they're dealing with the smaller chassis
compared to it
it's even smaller than the one s uh I
don't think it's smaller than the one s
is they're probably about comfortable in
size I can probably look it up it's
really small together the ones Oh we'll
do a side-by-side physical comparison or
in our full review of the s and the X
they still have a one right yes we do um
it's kicking around here somewhere
we've got one like you think the
original oh okay well we might get in
touch with Nikki V we yeah else but
we'll but the S was we do have a
netballer then yeah yeah the first one
anyways oh wow it's really compact
I want to go love this gonna be when we
turn it on what's interesting is the
power in Jack is here but it looks like
these look like power supply components
over here so intake vent wise it looks
like yeah it's fully it's fully open
along the side here so lots of cooling
there that looks like it might be the
hard drive mount but obviously we
haven't had it open yet and I actually
have to confess I can watch Lutz tear
down and then more vents here the front
is also vented along the bottom here so
basically what I'm guessing is there's a
couple of fans positioned kind of
somewhere on the inside that are pushing
air basically pulling air in everywhere
and then pushing it out the back through
both the power supply here and then what
would be the CPU GPU heatsink right here
this is quite hefty is the texture
bottom um like an event as well or no
it's not it's open on the sides here and
it's even open on the bottom of of this
side yeah I actually like the idea a lot
I think they've learned a lot since the
Xbox one because this looks really clean
I mean does there should be enough
airflow and they've done it so like the
size don't look obviously super like
open and grody but you can tell that it
would be even synchro we were not
dropping the 500 all consoles yeah
exactly
you know we saved that for the you know
the $5,000 gold-plated damage even
you know controller I think this is just
a standard elite controller yeah I don't
I don't think it's not even a no no
you're right Simon it's a standard
controller but they have an elite
controllers we do want to have the best
the definitive Xbox one X experience go
grab it from downstairs just drinking
all right well I think that's pretty
much it so guys um stay tuned John's
gonna be hard at work on pretty much
just this from now until then our video
goes up so I'll be working on this next
week yeah I mean I don't know if we have
a hundred percent nailed down what our
angle is but you know we don't talk
about that on Monday I think yeah so
we'll talk I mean maybe you let us know
so this video will go unlisted once
we're done streaming but maybe let us
know some things you'd like to see I
mean obviously some image quality
comparison has been a staple of of our
console coverage in the past we've
typically included a similarly priced PC
config and talked a little bit about you
know some of the games that are
cross-platform remember to like you
actually have the choice between which
platform you want to play it on now
thanks to play anywhere so a lot of
these titles will work in uwp as well as
on the console itself we're talking
about like you know which one you might
want to play it on would be pretty cool
yeah if you saw any of the launch titles
that we had in the box that you might
want to so what nothing much else but
but the ones included that you might
want to focus on um you're not working
the pocket on the path usually our sole
yeah we'll probably whip up the thermal
camera yeah I would think that would
make a lot of sense in here to the 1s
yeah really like to see how this thing
dissipates heat because he showed off
that people easy capacitor so we
actually have a bunch of 4k Ultra HD
test titles as well so what we could do
is we could fire them up on the w7
signature here see if we can discern any
difference between the 1s and the 1x
although I wouldn't expect anything well
it seems like actually maybe kind of a
wasted in my kit well this has HD HDR
support but so does the 1s yeah so I
feel so maybe we could maybe just throw
them all through make sure everything's
like working because a lot of people
have complained that in the very early
days of the one
yes 4k blu-ray compatibility wasn't
great yes so we've got at least eight to
ten titles that we could just kind of
throw through here maybe yeah they're
all working well it's kind of a tricky
thing especially because you don't even
have like 4k blu-ray drives for four pcs
yet for some reason so there's one
there's only one one Piscean right actly
what we had to import from japan do we
know how what you call it was quite
expensive it was like by the time you
buy that and then PC they can drive it
you might as well just got this yes yeah
okay so guys thanks for tuning into our
random little unboxing here and John now
you've got everything beautifully
arranged to say to cut stars out here
beautifully arranged we got we got we
got the oh yeah alright thanks for
watching guys we'll see you later
I just finished yes yes are you sure
okay stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
