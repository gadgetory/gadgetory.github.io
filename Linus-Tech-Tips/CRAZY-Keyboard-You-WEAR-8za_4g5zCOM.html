is useful enough to actually spend money
on it one keyboard rules them off it
doesn't have chords it doesn't have keys
hell it doesn't even have a bore so
forget everything you know because no
seriously like just forget it because
this thing has a learning curve all its
own
cheddar is a post cable network that
focuses on innovative products
technologies and services check out
their YouTube channel below and stay
tuned for more coming later in this
video
tap the wearable keyboard looks and
feels totally like sci-fi when you first
put it on but it's actually very simple
to use just take the strap out of its
charging case slide it over your five
feelers and press its one and only
button to both turn it on and activate
pairing mode your computer or your phone
or whatever will simply see tap as an
input device but while you might think
that it works by moving your hand in
space across a virtual QWERTY tap is not
that type of keyboard rather than
distinguishing characters based on your
fingers locations it works by assigning
each letter or number its own unique
gesture you see each of these rings has
its own three axis accelerometer which
communicates with the thumb unit via a
thin wire hidden within the straps
fitting cable tap registers keystrokes
by measuring the deceleration of your
fingers as they come in contact with the
surface which means a you do have to
type on something and not in the air and
B while you can use soft surfaces like
the couch or a friend's leg hard and
flat surfaces work best especially while
you're learning so let's cool is you
never have to look at your hand while
you're typing something that even the
most experienced touch typists have to
do from time to time with the drawback
being that you have to learn more than a
handful of these tap gestures
the most common letters vowels use the
simplest gestures single tabs while the
most common consonants use two finger
pairs and the complexity increases as
you go through the alphabet with some of
the more obscure letters reminding you
just how embarrassingly limited your
motor skills really are
fortunately the good people at tap had
the sense to include easy shortcuts like
double tapping your middle finger
instead of doing this and you're not
limited to letters there are gestures
for most common functions including
backspace and enter and you can even
toggle a numpad but having experienced a
range of it's called an alternative
keyboard layouts in the past we know
that sometimes no matter how great it is
the effort involved in learning to use a
new board just isn't worth it so how
does tap compare actually it's less
horrible than you'd think
the team worked with neuro scientists at
Stanford to design a training app that
gradually introduces and then drills the
gestures into your muscle memory
they even incorporated catchy little
jingles to help you remember certain
letter groups and the thing really works
James was able to learn the alphabet and
start slowly typing in about two hours
with most people apparently reaching 30
to 40 words per minute in about five now
one weird thing is that once you learn
the gestures on one hand you actually
don't need to relearn them for the other
hand it is oddly easy to switch which
tap lets you do in the helpful but not
actually necessary companion app tap
manager and there's more tap also has a
built-in Mouse that you switch on by
just laying your thumb down and then
moving your hand around provided that it
works on your desk I had to use a mouse
mat and that would make tap the most
ergonomic Mouse on the planet if it
weren't for the fact that you have to
lift your fingers to register clicks and
to scroll up and down a page you can
enter continue the scrolling mode by
tapping your ring and pinky
angers though it's not continuous enough
for my liking especially on the phone or
you can toggle a sustained left click
for dragging and highlighting by tapping
the ring and middle fingers the best
part is that there's very little latency
in switching from keyboard to mouse
which is critical because you need to
lift your hand off the surface once you
run out of mouse pad which brings us
then to the experience of using it
section of the video
unlike the mio gesture arm band thing
from a while ago tap can be reliably
turned off and on as you switch tasks
throughout the day so if you're cleaning
up you don't have to worry about it
registering a bunch of keystrokes as you
touch something then when you're ready
to type again the strap is actually
pretty good at registering the strokes
that you intend to type as long as you
do a good job of typing them it's light
enough to be worn comfortably for its
entire eight-hour battery life and it's
discreet enough to let you still use
your hand to use a mouse open doors or
tap that ass but just because tap is
pretty darn good for what it is doesn't
mean that I'm recommending that you rush
out and buy it considering that you're
not going to be faster using tab the use
cases that are compelling enough to
spend a hundred and eighty dollars on
one of these are pretty nice at least
for now however in a few years when we
have you know I don't know standalone AR
glasses and cap has managed to push the
price down to maybe forty to fifty bucks
I could see a device like this in or on
a lot more people's hands chatter TV has
a wide variety of different segments and
over on their YouTube channel you will
find a ton of topics one of them is
called the cheddar explains where they
take a particular topic and well they
explain it you can check out Cheddar's
video on cord cutting and traditional
media at the link below they go through
and discuss the cable industry how it's
changed over the past fifteen to twenty
years and how they're trying to adapt so
have a look at that video and the rest
of their content again through the link
below
so thanks for watching guys if this
video suck do you know what to do but if
it was awesome get subscribed hit that
like button or check out the link to
where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also linked down
there is our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join
something even the most experienced
touch typists have to do is though the
disadvantage is that you will have to
learn what are you doing right you do
