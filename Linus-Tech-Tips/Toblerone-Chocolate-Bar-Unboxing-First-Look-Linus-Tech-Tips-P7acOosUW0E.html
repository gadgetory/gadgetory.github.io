the things I got for Christmas
it is not computer related but I'm about
to sit down and watch a movie and I
thought I might like to have a little
bit of chocolate so you can see it came
nicely wrapped with thank you bow which
I'm guessing was recycled rather than
purchased to put on a Christmas present
but whatever that doesn't matter so you
can see here we have the table rune is a
Swiss milk chocolate with honey and
almond nougat and it is from Switzerland
now this is a 750 gram bar which means
someone either really likes me or really
hates me because they want me to gain
like almost a kilo of it's got to be
like pure weight like you got to imagine
this sleep on you right okay so the tape
we find at the bottom is right here
actually if you want to see the
nutritional facts I figure it's kind of
like specs for when I'm unboxing
computer hardware so this is all per one
piece so wow that's 20% of your daily
fat intake and 41% of your saturated fat
intake per single piece of this
Toblerone bar so let's get the seals
broken here and get this baby open I am
quite excited to see what we have inside
all right of this facetious unboxing
okay so the reveal inside we had a
yellow wrapper okay so this whole paper
paper sleeve comes right off and then
there's a yellow freshness sealed
wrapper inside which looks basically the
same now like Aalto blooms it is
triangular in shape and once we open up
the package up this and you can see that
we can slide out the bar and Wow big
pieces oh it's broken
oh okay so there you have it that is my
Toblerone unboxing thanks for checking
out my blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
