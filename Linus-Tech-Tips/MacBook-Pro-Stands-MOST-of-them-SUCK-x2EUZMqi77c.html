organization and frankly just way more
important projects this one has kind of
fallen through the cracks but finally
months after our first one arrived we're
digging through what is hopefully not a
large pile of brushed aluminum garbage
to find the best MacBook stands
thanks to video blocks for sponsoring
this episode there the first
subscription-based resource for
downloading stock footage video and more
stay tuned for an awesome offer from
them later on in the video so at the end
of our search we ended up with eight
macbook pro stands mostly because it's a
common search term and we want people to
find our video but also because nothing
prevents someone from using a macbook
stand with a razor blade or whatever
else unless they're terminally
unimaginative so first up is roosts
roost stand two out of ten named
terrible but anyway the product itself
is pretty cool it's by far the most
compact stand and our roundup and
quickly folds down to thirteen inches
making it perfect for carting around
with you so you can quickly prop your
laptop up in class or at a LAN party or
wherever you happen to be with that said
it's not my favorite as a permanent desk
installation because it's wobble control
is unexceptional at best and it's molded
plastic and nylon elastic construction
at this price point didn't really blow
us away twelve South's new stand the
curve is more of a desk fixture solution
than a portable one and it's IMO by far
the most aesthetically pleasing stand in
our roundup today and I'm pretty sure
this one is gonna end up in Ed's
apartment at some point but it's not the
most rigid stand in our lineup and on my
admittedly kind of shaky desk it's a
little bit jarring on something more
solid though it works well enough so if
you're after a stand for looks this one
gets our recommendation rain designs n
stand comes in two attractive variants
the M stand and the M stand 360 and in
three different colors as you probably
guessed the 360 variant spins around so
my first thought was POS system maybe
but then I was like who the heck uses a
MacBook as a point-of-sale system so
yeah according to Rain design it's meant
as
collaboration tool so I'll leave it up
to your imagination there as a stand
it's pretty darn good with basically no
wobble but as a heat sink seriously you
guys it's obviously complete
unless you apply a generous layer of
thermal goop to the bottom of your
macbook every time you use it
I mean rubber feet and a sizable air gap
anyone hello anyway adjustable stands
are more my jam so let's look at a few
those now Rain design to eye level has a
clean Apple esque aesthetic and a good
degree of adjustability but the laptop
holding plate is simply too thin
resulting in an unacceptable amount of
wobble regardless of your desk the near
five-star rating on Amazon frankly
didn't make a ton of sense to me until I
realized that many people were probably
using this product with a 13-inch
MacBook Air and that should be fine
twelve South's high rise for MacBook is
honestly no better the laptop platform
is wimpy and doesn't properly support
the 15-inch pro this adjustment
mechanism feels like they sacrificed
usability to tick off the adjustable
feature box and frankly I think it looks
way better upside down I mean seriously
check that out they should do a revision
where it's just they move the the pads
around and it's just upside down
bringing us finally then to a product
worth your money the crane stand
elevates this bad boy has all the
features without any usability
compromises its three-way adjustable
with bottom and top joints as well as
extensions on the support to get a huge
range of motion as you would expect from
a stand targeted at DJ's and while it's
a little more time consuming to adjust
once you get it in the right spot thanks
to the little teeth that lock in place
it does not move my only gripe with this
one is that it looks like a piece of
production equipment and that's not in a
good way so if you're a modern design
hipster you'll probably want to stay
away from this one last but not least is
12 South's Park Slope it's kind of in
its own category
rafer features and that there really
aren't any of them it's all in the name
it slopes your laptop when you park it
on top
putting our 15-inch MacBook Pro at just
the right angle for comfortable typing
similar to the kick stands on the back
of your keyboard the extra screen height
is neck friendly and as you can probably
imagine this one doesn't wobble I
honestly just wish they had used this
gauge and steel material on some of the
other stands so in conclusion what stand
to buy if aesthetics been the curve or
the M stand they're both sturdy and look
great so it's just a matter of which one
matches your setup best for
adjustability the only real option here
is the crane stand I wouldn't even
consider the other two unless you're
rocking a thin and light and as for an
elevated experience my go-to is 12
South's Park Slope it's fine but we also
didn't have anything else from this
category in the roundup so oh look at
the time gotta go videoblocks has one of
