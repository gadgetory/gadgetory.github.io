your computer and thought wow if only I
could get a bigger fan I might be able
to put my side panel back on well if
that's the case we've got the fan for
you and uh this thing is powerful
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description so listen right
here is the delta p FR o 9 1 2 x h e ad
let's let's call it the blow e Metron
and at $55 it is the most expensive blow
I've ever gotten I mean this thing is
almost four times the cost of even a
high-quality normal consumer fan so can
it possibly deliver four times the
performance well funny you should ask
try more like seven times the
performance ramping up to a whopping
eleven and a half thousand rotations per
minute in open air blowing Mitrano
chased a Goering 90 liters of air every
second but how would we actually
demonstrate what that means in real
world terms this thing not only spins
faster than the engine of my Civic it
probably has more torque too if you were
to get your finger in this thing well to
put it lightly you're gonna have a bad
time Oh disgusting
that's what happened using a finger lady
oh we finally stopped it jammed full of
Karen Soule done with all of that
blowing power we started to wonder about
what are the real-world applications so
here's one if you're really crunched for
space in your case at 37 millimeters
tall the super tiny Noctua NHL 9 eye is
about as small form-factor as you can
get for a heatsink
but of course that comes with some
trade-offs mainly that you aren't
supposed to use it on a high TDP that is
the thermal output CPU but there's the
way it suggests in the manual and then
there's the Linus tech tips way so can
this heat sink cope with a fully clocked
core i7 7700 K well actually it's a
surprisingly resilient little bastard
and was able to keep our 7700 K running
at full turbo speed under synthetic load
though it wasn't exactly comfortable at
a maximum of 97 degrees Celsius
fortunately though our CPU won't have to
run hot for long since good old blowy
mature on is coming to the rescue but
how much of a difference does a 7 x
increase in air flow make for real-world
cooling well Alex here is a great big
cooling nerd so the first thing we're
gonna do is look at it from a
theoretical standpoint what is it that
makes a heatsink
remove heat from a CPU and why does a
bigger better fan cool it more to put it
simply there are three things that
affect how much heat you can remove from
your processor the surface area that is
responsible for cooling the heat
transfer coefficient of the process and
the temperature difference between the
CPU and the surrounding air now it's
intuitive that increasing the amount of
air over a heatsink will make it cooler
think about putting your hand out of the
window of a car you go faster
you cool more but how much can upping
the air flow help your cool
so to figure out how big of the
difference this is going to make we have
to calculate the convective heat
transfer coefficient of air or how much
heat air can take away from an object
which is approximately equal to this
formula where H is the heat transfer
coefficient and V is the velocity of the
air so we know the knock to a fan pushes
air at about 1 meter per second and
plopping that into the formula gives us
an H value of 19.5 while blowing Metron
is air at 3.6 meters per second giving
us an H value of 25.8 but - it's pushing
the air three point six times faster why
does it only make a 25% difference to
cooling well you see I was masking the
other day and this one frigging square
root over the velocity kept kicking my
ass
you get diminishing returns the faster
the air moves so bringing it back to the
real world then can this be confirmed
with the blowing Mitrano well with it
strapped to our NHL 9i under full Odin I
264 the CPU maxed out at 73 degrees
Celsius leaving us lots of room for
overclocking by the way this also
amounted to about 30% cooler than the
stock fan close to our expected
temperature reduction of 25% and really
the LM do you thermodynamics and
precision pizza heating department
considers anything within an order of
magnitude a compelling victory of course
that compromise some of the space
savings with our heat sink leading us
then to another question this video
really turned into kind of a voyage of
discovery
what's better having a cooling solution
that's 3/4 fins or 3/4 a fan well we
tested it and in this situation the fan
actually still wins in cooling
performance per height although it isn't
all hunky dory strapped one of these
guys to your heat sink you're off to the
races with a chilly CPU first of all
there is power delivery that stock
knocked within sips 0.14 amps at full
load the blowing Mitrano on the other
hand well
you probably don't want to attach this
thing to a fan header on your
motherboard since it draws a whopping
four-and-a-half amps at full load which
is nearly enough to overwhelm this bench
power supply and of course there's also
the noise the knock to a fan puts out 24
decibels maximum which is quieter than
someone whispering library compare that
to the 75 decibels of the Delta which is
more comparable to an alarm clock
synergy is a software download that
solves the problem once and for all of
having two keyboards and two mice on
your desk if you have more than one PC
it lets you share a single mouse and
keyboard between two or even more
computers seamlessly so you'll no longer
get confused about which one is
connected to which they offer a basic
and pro option with a one-time payment
for lifetime access and the features
include clipboard sharing between the
computers dragging and dropping files
between the computers the ability to set
up hotkeys and more and the best thing
is that synergy is cross-platform whoa
PC Mac and Linux so use our link in the
video description to get up to 50% off
synergy today so thanks for watching
guys if you just like this video well
you must be in the like banana
protection league or whatever the case
may be because we pay ravaged to that
thing but if you liked it hit that like
button get subscribed maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured in the link in the video
description and also down there we've
got our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one banana and carrot
chunks not included as well as our
community forum which you should totally
join</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
