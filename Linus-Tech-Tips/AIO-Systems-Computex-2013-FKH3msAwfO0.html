2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm hey guys we were actually
on our way to another booth and we
passed by this food this is AI Oh buddy
b-roll here notice that there was a
monitor on the side of a computer when I
walked by I was going by pretty quickly
and only saw a monitor but it's actually
monitor on the side of a computer I'm
going to cover this really quickly so
we've got we've got two fan controllers
right here there's left and right so the
left one covers the three fans that are
on the left side here the right one
covers the three fans that are on the
right side here and there's two
uncontrolled plants at the top but
they're not very loud they're not
running super fast so that's okay you
don't need the top ones to be going
super fast because they're just slowly
wafting air out of the case got two USB
2.0 s 2 USB 3.1 headers front audio
jacks power switch and reset switch
which light up or damn depending on if
you're again in a game or not menu and
up and down is actually just for the
monitor remember you do have to be able
to control that then you have an OD d
slot and a hot swappable hard drive cage
which is actually very nice quality
looking couldn't get it out there
because the whole thing moved from its
very nice quality looking now we're
going to come around the back to see the
goodies of the back to do to do sorry
trying to dodge people and chairs all
alike as you can see here there is
actually a computer on the back that you
can make yourself the only plugs that go
in the back is a right angle power right
here which is very nice and just a quick
Ethernet came right there we don't need
it right now we're just running a demo
display you can fit pretty much a
general computer in there it looks
fairly common ATX form factor not really
big deal I can fit big gobs cards big
motherboard I'm not sure the exact
dimensions I couldn't understand but
full-size power supply tons of hard
drives and then there is what looks like
500 quarter inch Draves bays there for
optical drives but I don't think that'll
work at all so we'll ignore that I'm
just going to cross by the camera real
quick here there we go and try and get
be able to follow me another thing that
comes with it because you're looking at
this knowing okay this is for landing
personally I have seen people mod stuff
like this in two cases but it's usually
fairly get out looking this is actually
very refined by the way both just
probably keep going all abs plastics
it's hollow because if it wasn't hollow
it would add an insane amount to the
cost and it would add
and then stain amount to the weight
still fairly strong though I can hit it
and it's okay so I'm not too worried
about that but you're thinking landing
there's a big monitor on the front of my
case it's not gonna be that easy to rut
lug around I'm worried about things
hitting the front of my case in transit
that's okay it comes with this this is
still a prototype station he's not
exactly sure what material is going to
be using but it seems very very rigid so
far and should be totally fine that'll
protect your monitor it's just this
thing's huge but awesome and we're going
to land you have this much real estate
at your desk at almost all times I've
been to quite a few lands all you can't
fit is to monitor side by side but this
isn't as wide as to monitor side by side
so you can go to land plonk this guy
down and have everything you need that's
very very cool thanks for checking out
