out of a stormtroopers blaster or
they're mounted on the head of a shark
they're undeniably badass and the go-to
weapon for evil villains everywhere and
now us in our quest to dominate
YouTube's tech vertical we will be
harnessing the power of the laser so
that we can wow guys really that's what
we're using it for just like you'll be
using Corsairs new HS 50 if you need a
wired three-and-a-half millimeter
headset it features metal structural
components and 50 millimeter neodymium
drivers check it out at the link below
you know you know what I am I'm gonna
wear them for over a year now alex has
been trying to figure out how to make a
laser cutter that's both powerful and
cheap and that's where the good people
at smart DIY come in they had the smart
idea to make a DIY laser cutter kit
giving you the capabilities of a prefab
at a lower price by having you assemble
it yourself so it's like IKEA I guess
and that's what we'll be doing today but
first why do we want a laser cutter and
what exactly is a laser cutter okay no
I'm not gonna wear them the main things
that people use them for are to
accurately cut plastic or wood in two
dimensions or to engrave basically any
material and while we already have a 3d
printer that can fabricate plastic parts
in three dimensions because these parts
get printed in layers they can only be
their strongest in one direction at this
time easily pulling apart in the other
further contributing to their weakness
is the time and cost associated with
printing solid objects using fused
deposition modeling so it's much cheaper
and faster to make hollow stuff with a
laser cutter though you can cut pieces
of acrylic without giving up any of the
strength of the original material this
means you can build load-bearing things
like drone components or computer cases
using them so enough foreplay then let's
meet the smart DIY fabulous co 2 a 40
watt laser cutter kit hailing from Japan
we were initially worried this video
wouldn't be that interesting then we
opened up the packaging and holy Frank
look at that laser
oh it also computer water cooling parts
damn okay this should be fun the frame
is made of aluminum extrusion that gets
held in place using right angle brackets
the instructions aren't perfect and you
do have to pay really close attention to
the text in pictures but if you follow
them very carefully there's no reason to
screw
anything up now it's time for power
there's actually one power supply
already in here so that gives us one AC
to DC power supply for the electronics
then a switching power supply for the
laser the next piece is the rail with
the stepper motors once the tension is
adjusted these tracks should allow our
cutter to robot its way around the bed
and then these big cable holder tank
track chummy's that I'm sure have a real
name will keep it from snapping its
wires cables go in the motor side then
out on the bottom and over to the
controller this can communicate to the
outside once we have the i/o panel
attached which has USB AC power and also
this weird fitting thing that I'm not
totally sure what it does yet now it's
time for water cooling the initial plan
was to RGB it up and use our only chance
but unfortunately the fan controller
uses proprietary wiring and we would
need to do a fair bit of careful
soldering to get power to our RGB
controller so we decided to leave it
stock although a hard line tubing
upgrade is definitely still on the table
down the line when it came time to mount
the laser we realized that we didn't
have a large enough allen key for these
bolts so thank goodness for vice grips
Ben we carefully put the laser on making
sure not to tighten it down too hard or
we could risk breaking it with the laser
in wiring it up was pretty much a matter
of following the diagram until
everything but the pump is connected
we'll plug that in once the reservoir is
filled the only part of this build that
didn't feel all that premium was the
dampers for the top cover these long
bolts are kind of jank but they do the
trick and then with the acrylic
installed on top it looks pretty good
anyway okay but hold on a minute here if
the laser is locked in place in the back
how does it cut things ah well it
actually gets bounced around to the
desired location using front surface
mirrors the first one goes back here on
this piece of aluminum extrusion and
then
this is where this project started
taking a bit longer than expected it
would appear that a big part of the
reason that laser cutters cost so much
is because of how freakin long it takes
to get them properly calibrated so the
process is basically like this after
putting on the protective not to mention
very cool glasses that you need whenever
the laser back is open you take the
mirror and put a piece of masking tape
over it then briefly radiate the laser
which creates a burn mark on the tape to
show where it's hitting you adjust until
it hits in the center and then you're
good to go
no actually it's not quite that simple
either since the laser beam needs to hit
the center of all of the mirrors in all
of their possible locations around the
work area it actually was about a day of
fine-tuning before it was finally ready
to go the last steps then were filling
the loop putting on the final panels
installing the software the process for
which is conveniently entirely in
Japanese and booting it up and it works
and it's in English actually so for our
first test will engrave a dead meme on a
dead pcs side panel with okay so some
small issues at first but we'll just
turn vsync on here and hey the second
half of the etching went without a hitch
so guys as of filming this right now we
just got this bad boy running and we
definitely want to do a follow-up video
so let us know what you want to see us
do and we'll add it to the list of super
cool projects that we have planned for
the fabula co2 and on the subject of
things that are super cool Tunnel bear
if you've been looking for an
easy-to-use VPN app then tunnel bear is
the first and last place to look it's
super easy to use and they've got apps
available for iOS Android they've got a
Chrome extension they've got it for PC
they've got it for Mac and it's got lots
of great features as well one of them is
what's called
switch so before you connect to a
network your device actually starts to
send information about itself and what
it wants to do and a kill switch stops
this from happening because during that
time before you connect to a normal VPN
all that traffic is unencrypted so in
the few seconds it takes to connect
you've probably already broadcast your
IP maybe a few DNS requests or a search
query vigilant Bear stops all this from
happening by blocking all outbound and
inbound traffic so nothing leaks out
before you connect and if your
connection goes down for some reason
vigilant bear will kick back in and stop
until the connection comes back so for a
free trial of tunnel bear go to tunnel
bear comm /l tt will have that linked
below thanks for watching guys if this
video suck do you know what to do but if
it's awesome put on some glasses like
this get subscribed hit that like button
or check out the link to where to buy
the stuff we featured in the video

cool shirts like this one and our
