brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital hey guys we're here at
the rockettes wheaton the first thing
they wanted to show me was the ryo's tkl
pro or 10 keyless Pro and right away you
can notice it has a fixed wrist rest a
really big fixed wrist rest you don't
see that very often especially in that
large form format I like this a lot
because you can see it actually is able
to work for my hand my hand actually
positions properly on WASD with my hands
still on the wrist rest which is not
super common I have to use detachable
ones usually but not the tattwa one that
comes with the keyboard so I can leave
it on my desk shift it down away from
the keyboard so its proper positioning
so that's actually pretty cool to see
not all the time people are doing fixed
wrist wraps for tenkeyless keyboards but
reasoning for this is a lot of tanki
those keyboards it's it's people buying
it because their gaming and they don't
need the numpad it's not necessarily
people buying it because they have this
tiny little miniature desk that can't
fit it so they're not super worried
about saving space in this way it's just
there so they can save space so that
your your shoulder width is more natural
because a lot of people find with really
wide keyboards with macro keys on it all
that kind of stuff you end up doing a
spread eagle formation with your hands
whereas if you could have it straight in
line it's a little bit more ergonomic
next we come to the kone xtd which is an
optical mouse and if you're wondering
about optical versus laser you can check
out our tech quickie video on that
subject and that should explain what's
actually going on but it's quite
interesting because it has something
pretty unique you can change the liftoff
distance in the software on your
computer which is pretty unique to this
mouse another nice thing that it has is
in the bottom where you're waiting
system is they responded to some
customer feedback about the weighting
system rattling around and making some
noise so they put a rubber pad in there
to stop that which is which is nice
because the weighting system isn't
moving and it's nice because it's not
annoying you with the audio and finally
we come to the cave xtd 5.1 analog first
look at this headphone you can see that
it's quite deep in the cans and I
noticed that it's actually nice there's
a few headphones I think you've if you
watch the wine show you've heard me
complain about my my ears will touch the
inside it becomes quite uncomfortable
with extended use and my ears do not
touch the inside of these these have
quite a few unique features as well as
you already hear their 5.1 and they have
actually angled drivers on the inside
I'd a lot of 5.1 headphones it's just a
flat surface where all the drivers are
and this is a much different way of
doing that I'm excited to try it out in
a more extended use environment to see
exactly how I feel about it but it is
very cool to see them innovating in that
way another cool thing they have with
these headphones if I can plug this guy
or pick this guy up here right here is
they have movie and game settings
traditionally when you see this you
automatically assume equalizer and
you're pretty much always right but not
in this case what it's actually doing is
it's changing where the vocal channels
coming through so if you go to movie
it'll move it to the front and rear
speakers instead of just the center
speaker and if you go to game it sits on
where it is trying to naturally come
from that way it's not screwing with you
if you in a game and putting voices
where they're not supposed to be but
then if you're in a movie you can more
easily hear the vocal channels I'd like
to thank our sponsors NCIX WD and
corsair for sending us here in the first
place and as always if you want to see
