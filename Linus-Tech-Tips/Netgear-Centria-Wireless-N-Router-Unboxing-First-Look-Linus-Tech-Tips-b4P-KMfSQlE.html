the Netgear sentry ah contrary to what
you might think based on the name of
this product it is not going to
supervise anything although I guess I
mean okay hold on a second because you
know routers gonna have a firewall in it
so maybe I'm not taking the whole sentry
uh because I was thinking like sentry
like you know like that but the ones
that pay attention not like the
videogame ones where it's like they look
the other way and you walk up and shank
them no sentry ax is more like central
in this context so the idea is that this
is not only a router but also just
generally a digital media hub so it does
a number of different things home
networking simplified blah blah blah etc
etc internet Wi-Fi router network map
parental controls that's important for a
lot of people already share easy to
install monitor control and repair your
home network with Netgear geni so that's
their cloud-based management live
parental controls guest network access
broadband usage meter that's a great
feature AirPrint compatible which is
definitely a good thing and the fact
that it has a lot of different
functionality here so you can backup so
you it does have a hard drive bay or you
look at that you can single click SD
card backup super speed USB 3.0 ports
for expanded storage and you can have a
removable easily upgradable hard drive
you can share so this we expect with
pretty much any router but you can share
your USB hard drive and your printer
which is again sort of normal create a
personal cloud for secure remote access
that's something that not every router
necessarily has and I can't figure out
how this box opens but we'll work on
that later use your mobile device to
control and player media fun and play
your media on DLNA compatible devices
and finally connect so high-speed dual
band Wi-Fi 450 plus 450 so it's n900
optimized for streaming two USB 3.0
ports which is ahead of pretty much
everything else out there and package
contents which of course we will find
out because we're gonna open that's
where it opens yay environmentally
friendly packaging love to see this
so there's your paper thing this is a
big router holy smokes this thing
alright so we're going to need to do the
old iPhone size comparison
because yeah this thing is like huge so
here's an iPhone and that's a router
seriously it's a router okay and then
there's like that so we're gonna go
ahead and switch to the camera that
makes a lot more sense to be using for
this there's the iPhone thickness
compared to the router thickness and
there's the size again so yeah that's
that's a big big router here's an
installation guide which presumably you
will use and then inside the rest of the
packaging we have more environmentally
friendly packaging which you know way
look at this it has a drawer in the
bottom that is awesome every time I see
something that I have never seen before
as an unboxer I kind of geek out because
that so the stuffs here and then the
drawers here it's like a jewelry box not
that I'd know anything about jewelry
boxes so you gotta let's see contents
wise you got an Ethernet cable included
so it looks like cat 5e you've got a
power brick it's gonna be a bigger power
brick than you'd normally see on a
router because it does have the
potential to install a hard drive inside
it power cable again so that's like a
standard PC power cable so it's like
again beefier and then finally what
appears to be a this side up this should
face back of product only use with three
and a quarter inch thick disk okay so
this is something to do with the hard
drive mounting mechanism so let's have a
look at the router itself it's glossy I
mean this should basically be like a sin
at this point like you know someone
someone with sort of all-powerful beta
abilities should go and smite you know
everyone who makes things glossy because
it looks fantastic in like product
brochures but then as soon as I pick up
the thing now now I've touched it now
it's ruined so you can see in that
camera presumably usually you can also
see surface imperfections very very
easily with with glossy surfaces so
that's not something I don't like about
them what have you got here so there's
secure Wi-Fi WPS button so there's the
label for that Wi-Fi on or off
love seeing a dedicated Wi-Fi on and off
switch and there's a one button OneTouch
backup button so this is cool okay this
is the kind of feature that I don't
expect to find on a router those are
their SD card backup is actually built
right into the side of the unit that's
very cool
so there's one of your USB 3 ports
there's your backup button
there's your SD card slot very very cool
the back is glossy again no surface
imperfections though I'm looking at you
and you and then inside there wouldn't
have minded it these were a little bit
easier to access because of the shape of
the router you can see it's it's a bit
of a sort of you can't get two fingers
in there to plug in Ethernet port and
easily but there's an LAN port for
gigabit ethernet ports USB three over
here on the other side a reset button a
reset switch power on and off that's a
toggle switch which is nice I like
knowing if it's powered on or off and DC
in over here we have the
three-and-a-half inch hard drive cage so
that is where you will actually always
power off before removing the hard drive
that's good advice case has a standard
SATA interface at the back there I hope
you guys can see that I don't think you
can because of diesels depth of field
trickery tomfoolery that makes it so
you're focused up here and not back
there but it's okay you'll have to trust
me it's in there and I think that pretty
much wraps it up so what sets the Sentry
apart from other routers basically the
fact that you can install a hard drive
in it there are other routers Western
Digital has won the there my net and 900
that you can install a hard drive in
I'll look at that non-slip feet on the
bottom so that's good
the fact that it's Netgear so you know
it's good you know there's like nothing
wrong with it it's not gonna explode
when you plug it in or anything like
that
and any functionality that they say it
has it pretty much will have so you
don't have to worry about that and of
course it is so much larger than all the
other routers that it will simply crush
them especially with the hard drive
inside so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look don't forget to
