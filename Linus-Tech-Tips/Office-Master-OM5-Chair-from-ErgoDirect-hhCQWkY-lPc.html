an interesting one it's it's a weird
category to begin with since you can't
exactly graph but comfort and Excel
making everything very subjective but
since we needed to find new chairs for
our new office whether we ended up
buying them or trading a position as the
official chair of our new office and the
land show or something like that we set
out to find something that would match
our black and orange corporate colors
yeah and cushion our precious high knees
while we make videos about both chairs
and other things
ozone gaming's argon RGB mouse features
an 8200 dpi laser sensor complete with a
16 point 8 million color lighting system
and nine programmable buttons check out
the link in the video description to
learn more need for seat the first brand
we were actually ever in contact with
left a very good impression with their
Dominator chair dxracer sent us their
f-series which we agreed as a team was
quite solid but not as well-built as the
max nomic then we received chairs from
arrazi and GT Omega that were decidedly
not as good as either of the others even
though we did appreciate the effort GT
Omega put in to impress us by
embroidering our logo on the chair so
with the way things we're just kind of
getting worse as we continue to pursue
lesser-known brands we made a final
decision and max anomic ended up
sponsoring all the chairs at our office
but that doesn't mean that I wasn't
reading your messages asking us to check
out something other than flashy gaming
chairs enter the office master o m5 a
non gaming chair but also the winner PC
gamer comms recommended award in April
of this year and an option that
intrigued me enough to give a non gaming
chair a spin for review even though we
had already locked in a sponsor for the
new office first I needed to get my
hands on one so we reached out to our go
direct who carries pretty much every
different variety of om5 you could
possibly want
it's actually it's a little easier than
it sounds because every single chair is
custom-made with a wide variety of color
and finish options available so I went
with the premium palladium gray frame
the pivoting and sliding arm upgrade the
gray poly flex
slatted backing material without
upholstery my back tends to get kind of
warm so I figured the ventilation would
be nice then I went with the rocket 4506
color for the seat upholstery added a
chrome cylinder and polished aluminum
base and finished it off with the
standard multi surface soft casters
overall I'd say the ordering process was
actually the most difficult part of this
video I mean the information is all
there like the upholstery fabric catalog
that actually gives a really nice look
at all the various weaves and finishes
below the chair itself but our go direct
could improve the ordering experience
dramatically with a live preview as
you're selecting options like what D
brand comm has on there vinyl skin
ordering page where you can see a rough
idea of what the chairs going to look
like all put together before you click
order something that in my mind is
essential when you're ordering online
once the chair arrived though it was
packed well enough and setup was very
straightforward like if you've ever
assembled a chair there won't be
anything here to surprise you other than
how heavy the om5 is for its size but I
guess that's where the lifetime warranty
comes from because the construction of
the chair was very good across the board
the casters roll smoothly the
construction of the frame is rugged the
backrest slats had ample give without
feeling flimsy and even the plastic used
feel similar to that stuff that they
make like kids playgrounds out of super
tough and not cheap feeling at all all
right so enough physical tour let's get
into the chair I've had the om5 in my
computer room at home since or go direct
sent it to me so for about 4 months and
I guess you can consider the following
to be based on my long-term impressions
for your reference I'm 5 foot 6 150
pounds and my wife's who is 5 foot 4 and
about a hundred pounds since the chair
only ended up belonging to me for about
six weeks before she claimed it
as her own and actually only just got it
back from her recently to finally do
this video the seat cushion material is
great some seats like the leather Costco
office chairs that my wife and I were
using before have this padding material
on it that feels soft when you put your
hands on it but that is too soft and
exposes your tushie to the hard flat
wooden board underneath when you have to
sit on it for a long period of time now
I don't have this problem with the max
anomic chairs in the office that use a
dense enough foam to prevent the issue
but office master takes things a step
further by shaping the hard supporting
surface below the cushion to relieve any
potential pressure points my butt's not
flat so it makes sense for the seat
surface to have more cushion near the
back where my weight will be above it
and less at the front where it just has
to deal with my legs
next is the backrest I've only got a
couple of complaints here number one is
that the plastic slats remind me of like
80s patio furniture something I would
buy for my kids to sit on they look kind
of cheap and number two when you get up
in the middle of the night and you're
not wearing a shirt you can kind of
stick to them a little bit but I mean
it's called office master not sitting in
it naked master so I guess that's not a
complaint that they get that often and
other than that I love the way the slats
adjust to automatically redistribute
themselves to the shape of my back so
they can be supportive without any
pressure points whether I'm sitting
completely straight or reclining in it a
little bit which leads us I guess to the
big killer feature of the om5 it only
has a height adjust lever on the bottom
that's it there is no lever to recline
because the user is expected to just
lean to adjust the position and have it
stay there and this is some serious
witchcraft here because it actually
works to be clear it doesn't recline the
way that our gaming chairs can and it
doesn't have the requisite headrest for
that functionality to make sense anyway
you won't be sleeping in it but if
you're going to be working at a desk I'd
say it goes about as far back as you
could need and then it stays there which
doesn't mean I have no complaints the
arm rests
we're very underwhelming especially
considering this is an upgraded option
over the standard ones and the base
chair doesn't come with any arm rests at
all they are adjustable in height
forward and backward movement and angle
but the angle positions are very limited
and the forward back slider doesn't lock
at all meaning it was something I
constantly had to fidget with and on the
subject of paying extra for adjustable
armrests by the way the m5 is not cheap
it may be affordable compared to brands
like Herman Miller but while I had
actually written a lot of this review
thinking that the Dominator chair that I
use in my office at work was similarly
priced because it's been over a year
since I did the video on that I forgot
how much it costs the om5 even in its
base configuration with no arm rests is
$200 more than a Dominator and the
config that you're looking at costs
about double so is the OM 5 the most
comfortable of the chairs we've reviewed
so far the answer is yes with its
versatility as a one-size-fits-all
solution being another major selling
point especially if you're outfitting an
office for more than 10 people and you
can't run around buying a different
sized chair for everybody's body type
but with convenience and comfort comes a
higher price tag
nothing outlandish but it just does cost
more speaking of whatever I was talking
