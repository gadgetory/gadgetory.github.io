is the Samsung sync master
something-or-other s 27a 858 D so
Samsung is not real great at naming
their monitors in a way that is like you
know dresses it up you know it's like a
numeric numbering scheme however if they
were going to call this something they
would call it the Samsung display that
might actually get Linus to change his
monitor that's right so I actually have
a 305 t plus that I bought way back in
the day so 30-inch monitor so I'm not
going to be getting a resolution upgrade
I'm not going to be getting a size
upgrade this is a 27 inch display with a
2560 by 1440 resolution so yes for you
purists out there this is a 16 by 9
monitor it is not 16 by 10 however I
would argue that once you get up to this
kind of a size at this kind of a
resolution it starts to matter a lot
less because you have that outstanding
vertical space to work with regardless
of whether you're using 16 by 9 or 16 by
10 just going to pull the accessories
out here and we're going to proceed with
the unboxing very slim very low-profile
stand I'm already impressed with that so
why am I so excited about this one I
already have a 305 T and the answer is
that this monitor uses a new display
technology called pls so you guys are
probably familiar with MVA PDA IPs and T
n IPs until now certain kinds of IPs
have been the highest quality displays
in terms of color reproduction in terms
of vibrancy in terms of viewing angles
so whether you're looking at it from
here from here from here IPS has
delivered the best experience now VA is
sort of a second but not that far away
alternative to IPS with the advantage
being less expensive and finally Tien is
fast Tien is fine for gamers who don't
care about the color accuracy and are
more concerned with less motion blur
which is often referred to as ghosting
but that's a misnomer there are actually
different things so less motion blur but
it does not deliver a very satisfying
experience for professionals who are
doing video or photo editing or who are
concerned about color accuracy in any
way at all honestly I'm not a big TN
advocate my monitor is a VA panel some
of the high-end 30-inch monitors are IPS
panels so whatever
that's all neither here nor there at
this point in time why am i excited
about pls the reason for that is the
first time I saw a pls display was on
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 now the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 if you watched my tablet
roundup was what I declared to be
hands-down the best screen on any tablet
yes that includes the IPS displays on
tablets like the Asus Transformer it
includes the IPS display on the iPad 2
which is widely regarded to be an
excellent display fantastic display in
terms of color oh man this is hard to
assemble in midair like this ok got it
in terms of color in terms of viewing
angle just brightness everything just
gorgeous great display and the Galaxy
Tab 10.1 blew it out of the water in my
opinion so let's have a look at this
monitor and see sort of the the
aesthetic here that I think is of what I
think is going to be one of the most
interesting monitors that I have ever
unboxed or ever seen in action so here
we go pretty standard pretty
professional look this is a busy
this class monitor so you're not going
to find any sort of hint of color like
designs or any of that consumer stuff
you got a black bezel you got your on
screen display navigation buttons here
there's your menu there's your down
you're up your sensor which is cool okay
so it does have that sensor on it so
well I'm not sure if on this particular
monitor it senses whether you're in
front of it or not give me a sec I'm
going to find out so yes that's what I
thought it was that's the Eco motion
sensor which will actually turn the
monitor on when you sit in front of it
and turn it off when you go away here we
have the source selection and we've got
our power so there's not a whole lot of
intrigue there this has a nice finish to
it though so you can see this actually
has like kind of a brushed look although
it's not made of aluminum which is good
because as soon as you touch it it would
put your removable fingerprints all over
it and then it would look horrible
forever all right let's turn it around
and let's have a look at the business of
the panel so it is LED backlit which is
going to improve your power economy as
well as improve the profile of it so
it's not super thick but this is not
sort of a repeat of their 3d monitor
which I have a there that's okay you
can't really see it from here which is
almost as thin as an iPhone now Samsung
has not skimped on the i/o for this
particular panel we have audio in
headphones out a USB 3 hub yeah yeah
3 USB 3 ports there's your USB 3 in so
I'm very excited to see that included
very much a next generation feature here
we have our power in our DVI in to DVI
in one so you have dual DVI in
DisplayPort in having these kinds of
input options is outstanding because
remember this is a very high resolution
panel 2560 by 1440 that means that it
requires a significant amount of
processing in order to process those
images on the fly so let's go ahead and
turn it this way so you can see it has
portrait mode it has landscape mode
it's I don't know if it yeah okay so it
turns this much
it turns this much okay and we've also
got a height-adjustable stand up here
and down to there let me just see if
there's anything that I'm missing here
in terms of what Samsung has to say for
themselves I haven't gone over the
included accessories yet so I'm going to
go ahead and oh it says it comes with 4
USB 3 port floors the last one then hold
on just a minute I don't see another one
okay well we're going to say three for
the time being and then perhaps it's
four it does come with a dual link DVI
cable remember you will need a dual link
compatible cable and dual link
compatible video card because this is
like once again a very high resolution
panel it comes with the USB 3 a 2 B
connector that you will need in order to
hook up the monitor and let me just have
a look at what else we bought so pls
technology yes pls like I said I can't
emphasize this enough better than
anything else out there in my limited
experience so far which is limited only
because I was only able to see it in a
tablet form factor this is going to be
the true acid test for me because this
is a full-size monitor with a nice matte
screen because remember all those
tablets are using glossy screens so I
can truly evaluate it with a matte
screen and I can compare it to IPS
monitors and VA monitors that I have
used in the past
so Samsung's claim for this particular
display which I did write down because I
thought it pretty much summarized it was
that the new pls technology delivers
picture-perfect and natural-looking
images for more accurate photo editing
and more spectacular gaming so yeah I
think that's pretty much it I want you
guys to stay tuned on my NCIX comm
channel so that you can have a look at
this thing in action because we are
going to fire it up right now I don't
really have the time but I'm going to
actually use the thing give you my
impressions and let you know what I
think of this Payless monitor it is
available in a couple of different sizes
we have the 27-inch here but it is also
available in 24 inch and if you are
interested in these specs so the 1,000
to one dynamic contrast ratio although I
have to tell you guys that's very
meaningless because something with
thirty thousand to 1 contrast ratio can
often not look as good as something with
a legitimate 1000 to 1 contrast ratio it
just depends on how its being rated 5
millisecond graded gray response time
which is also completely meaningless I
will play some games on it I'll let you
guys know how it goes and that's pretty
much it thank you for checking out my
