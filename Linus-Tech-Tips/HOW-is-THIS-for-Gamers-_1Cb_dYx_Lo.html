with yet another refresh of skylake and
the script for this one which helpfully
included in the box here is pretty much
the same as last time with there we go
so let's see here we got more cores and
we got some more cash to go with them
and done it no new process node no
avx-512 support and I can't even believe
this we're still using the same gt2
graphics engine with the same number of
execution units at the same clocks but
is it possible that there's more than
meets the eye yes and I'll be telling
you about it after these messages from
origin origin PC 0 15 s features a
smooth 144 Hertz 1080p display with an
NVIDIA GTX 1070 max Q graphics card and
also weighs only 4.3 pounds check it out
at the link below
let's start with some good news
shall we intel has finally caved to the
pressure or made the decision on their
own using whatever new logic that they
use and soldered the IHS to the dye
which should mean that we won't need to
keep deleting our CPUs in order to get
decent thermals out of them though on
not not promising that I won't do that
anyway what do you think Pella should I
do it should I risk $1,000 processor you
only live once right this is it
but our delicious solder cheeseburger
also comes with a side of on it
milkshake because for the first time
that I can remember we are actually
losing hyper-threading and some of the
cash perk or on the 9th 10 core i7 in
fact for now nothing but the new 8 core
core I $9.99 hundred K includes hyper
threading technology
so Intel doesn't screw me over here
because my core i3 i5 i7 explainer is
now inaccurate just weeks before it
would have hit 10 million views so way
to go guys thanks a lot the hardware
mitigations for Spectre and meltdown do
make me feel a little bit better though
these should take over from some of the
software and firmware fixes which again
this is a big should restore some extra
performance per core speaking of
firmware we've actually got a new
chipset on our hands except that it's
basically what we think the Z 370
chipset should have been in the first
place with the only added features being
USB 3.1 gen2 support and integrated
Wi-Fi via what Intel calls integrated
connectivity or the summe for short I'm
sorry just kind of an aside here do you
guys remember when Intel had simple
memorable marketing like
and Centrino who the hell is in charge
over there right now I mean even the
core i3 i5 i7 nonsense was less
confusing than this hotness and at least
10 million people need I remind you
didn't understand that on the plus side
at least both the ninth gen chips and
boards are backwards compatible with 8th
gen gear and vice versa bringing us then
to the elephant in the room more cores
it seems Intel has finally had enough of
AMD lording Ryze ins 8 cores over them
and here we have not one but two Intel
Core Series CPUs with 8 cores but with
that said they haven't yet tired of AMD
lording they're more aggressive pricing
over them because for a 16 thread
processor you will be paying a nearly
40% premium to get a blue case badge
making the cheaper 8 thread core i7
possibly a much easier pill to swallow
at least we think so because in telling
their infinite wisdom isn't sampling
that chip yet so we were forced to pull
a little trick out of our hats that
we've used before
so in our grass you're gonna see
performance numbers for the 9900 K the
core i9 then you're gonna see
performance numbers for that same chip
with its hyper threading disabled and
it's maximum two core boost adjusted to
4.9 gigahertz we're gonna be labeling
these results core i7 9700 K because
from our experience in the past these
results should be very close to the real
chip but they aren't the real chip so
hence the finger quits
alright here we go right away we can see
that Intel's PR and marketing
departments got at least one thing right
over the last couple of scandal-plagued
weeks this CPU is absolutely the best
CPU in the world for gaming it's faster
than the 8700 K which pretty much
qualifies it right there but the
difference here is relatively minor a
few FPS here and there and what's weird
is that it seems to be struggling with
DirectX 12 right now
as expected the extra course aren't
doing us any favors in current gaming
titles and we're pretty much relying on
the extra 300 megahertz on the boost
clock for our performance games just
like with the 8700 K when it first
launched it should be noted however that
the RT X builds of games like
Battlefield 5 should take advantage of
more course so maybe we will see a
bigger difference there whenever those
builds show up
moving on to productivity it's here that
we see the biggest improvements over the
8th gen flagship and thanks to the extra
clock speed the 9900 K even manages to
eclipse the more expensive core i7 78
20x on intel's high-end x 299 platform
that even extends to avx-512 enabled
workloads like blender where
traditionally intel's high-end desktop
chips dominate on a per core basis
what's even more exciting for streamers
is that x264 performance is
significantly improved here with the new
core i 9 landing striking distance from
the 7900 X whose MSRP is nearly double
so the 9900 K is looking pretty good so
far and if you've been paying attention
to the graphs you'll probably also have
noticed that our simulated core i7 9700
K is also holding up well typically
outperforming the 8700 K that it
replaces making the loss of
hyper-threading confusing but less of a
big deal from a performance standpoint
than you might have expected and there's
more to be happy about - thanks to the
soldered IHS the Cora 999 hundred K
actually enjoys better thermals than the
8700 K from last generation even under
full load and sustained power
consumption is actually down as well
that's especially good news compared to
the relatively power-hungry 78 20 X but
and it's a big but we haven't addressed
the price tag yet at 30 to 40% more than
the core i7 8700 K and rise in seven
2700
AMD Intel's 8-core 16 thread consumer
chip is in a price bracket all on its
lonesome somewhere in the no-man's land
between the consumer and the high-end
desktop markets which means that gamers
are going to do a double-take
and anyone building a budget workstation
is going to be forced to choose between
per thread performance and memory
bandwidth and PCI Express Lanes because
Z 390 doesn't add quad channel memory or
more PCIe lanes unfortunately now that
we have real performance numbers instead
of the bummed up ones that intel either
through blatant malice or stunning
ineptitude showed off before the launch
where are we left here thanks to its
bloated 490 dollar price tag with
limited availability potentially pushing
that higher the Cora 999 hundred K ends
up looking less compelling to us than
intel's own core i7 9700 k and this
whole launch in general doesn't look
like it's gonna go over too many pure
gamers from cheaper lower core count
options even from Intel's own line up
men for the streamers out there who are
looking to upgrade honestly we probably
recommend an RT X GPU for its stellar
hardware h.264 encoder instead as for
the non-gamers AMD is still fighting
this battle from a position of strength
Rison still gives you more chorus per
dollar it includes ECC support if that's
important to you and it even brings more
PCI Express Lanes to the table but if
gaming is just one of the things you do
and you want the best of both worlds at
least Intel has some response now to the
fantastic performance of the r7 2700 X
in non gaming applications I mean there
is something to be said for getting to
the end of your shift and firing up csgo
at over 500 frames per second we're
going to need some faster monitors
pretty soon hey speaking of things we
need this message from I fix it the I
fix it pro Tek toolkit is designed to
help you tackle almost any electronics
repair challenge

suction cup for removing glass panels
from phones and tablets all iFixit tools
are backed by a lifetime warranty so if
something breaks they will replace it
for free and their site is full of great
guides so you don't need to be a genius
to fix your electronics you just need
the right tools so go to ifixit.com
forward slash Lynas and pick up your
protec toolkit today we're gonna have
