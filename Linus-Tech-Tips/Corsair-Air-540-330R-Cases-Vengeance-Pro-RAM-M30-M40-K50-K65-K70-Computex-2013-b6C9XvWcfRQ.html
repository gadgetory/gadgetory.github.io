powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM guys here we are the Computex 2013
coverage just keeps coming this time
we've got the carbide series err 540
from corsair this is as you may or may
not have figured out at this point
already an air cooling optimized case
and my joke to these guys was well well
then you went and put a liquid cooler in
it so just because it's optimal for air
cooling doesn't mean that you can't also
liquid cool the thing so check this out
the main difference between the air 540
and pretty much any other case out there
is this direct path that airflow is
going to have from the front of the case
so there's like a few inches there to
the graphics cards themselves there are
no harddrive cages there are no other
random obstacles nothing like that so
you can put up to four graphics cards in
this case because it does have eight PCI
expansion slots so that's a standard ATX
chassis also they include pretty darn
good fans so you've seen their airflow
series fans they include an OEM version
of the airflow series fans much like
what we see included with the H 100 I
where it's sort of a no rubber grommet
version so these rubber grommets here as
well as the interchangeable color rings
they're missing those but other than
that they are very similar to a f1 40s
so you get three of those with the case
two in the front and one in the back now
hard drive cages you've only got a
couple there down here at the bottom but
it makes up for it in let's go ahead and
switch sides here here that is not
awkward at all there we go
but you make up for it with SSD mounts
so you can mount up to four SSDs in this
tool-free cage right here above the
power supply you can mount two five and
a quarter inch Bay's over here and you
see all this cable mess that's the other
thing that makes this case very unique
is that almost well really nothing other
than the bare minimum essentials that
you have to run over to the other side
is going to be interfering with the
airflow of the case I mean if the power
supply the drives is all in a completely
separate compartment other than those
hard drives which really aren't going to
be a problem because they're down way
down at the bottom now you can mount to
five and a quarter inch devices right
here so you can see how those come
through at the front you've also
got super speed USB 3 aswell headphone
and microphone ports power and reset
switches and I mentioned before that
just because it's air cooling optimize
doesn't mean you can't liquid cool the
thing so check this out you pull off the
top by the way that is a very very loose
mesh optimal for as you may or may not
have guessed airflow and up here on the
top you can see where they've got an H
100 I mounted you could also mount an H
110 so it accepts up to a 240 millimeter
radiator but wait there's more even with
long graphics card so there's GTX 670 s
in there now this front piece can be
taken off as well this is a magnetic fan
filter which hopefully I can figure out
how to get off here but ah there we go
okay magnetic fan filter so you can do
either the two 140 millimeter fans that
come with the case or three 120
millimeter fans and you can mount either
of them at the same time in push-pull
meaning that this is one liquid cooling
friendly case in spite of the fact that
it is air cooling optimized now I
realized I must have bumped the power
cord or something because the system
wasn't on showing off all of its sexy
Corsair glory before so if I can just
find that power switch there we go so
now you can see the illuminated h100 I
the color matching SP series fans as
well as their add on individually
sleeved power supply cables the
illuminated Dominator platinum Ram and
of course these LED strips are powered
by Corsair link so remember guys Corsair
components not only make your PC perform
better they make it look better too and
Corsair did not actually pay me to say
that dude not now and this case might
not really look familiar to you this is
the carbide Series 330 R but once we
open it up inside it will probably look
familiar because it's based on the same
design as the 300 R so let's start with
what's different from the outside it has
a power switch which is a new innovation
in Corsair cases they've never done this
before they always relied on the user to
actually have lightning strike their
house and power on their computer by
pure chance so this is just a huge step
forward in convenience and innovation I
love this that's another dollar by the
way guys that's two dollars right there
so on the inside you can see this
is a more noise dampened silence
optimized case so we've got a silent
panel right here we've got the same dual
fan intakes right here but check this
out
this little duct course are actually
found by adding this little piece of
plastic it helped these two front fans
fight with each other less over the
airflow allowed them to draw more fresh
air from the outside and in their
testing they found that it improves
graphics card temperatures by two to
three degrees so it's amazing how those
little tweets can make all the
difference in the world now up here at
the top we find flexibility so check
this out you remove this noise dampener
right there but if you do not
necessarily want the utmost in noise
dampening and you would instead prefer
to have a little bit more performance
out of your case you can remove it and
you can install two 120 millimeter or
two 140 millimeter fans including room
for radiators so it can accept in each
100 I or an H 110 without any difficulty
whatsoever the side panel is your usual
fare for silence optimized cases with
noise dampening material on the inside
gives it a nice heft to it as well and
other than that the internals haven't
really changed much so what's this for
it's for someone who wants the
flexibility of high airflow
or silence and someone who doesn't
necessarily want to pony up for the
Obsidian 550d and as a traditionally
memory company of course Corsair has a
memory product to announce this is the
Vengeance pro series optimized for
Intel's fourth generation Core i5 and
core i7 processors code-named has well
these memory modules are also optimized
much like other vengence products to
look good so they are launching in four
different colors there's gold which you
can see rotating on the little pedestal
in there as well as blue red and silver
so these are going to go with your
motherboard pretty much no matter which
brand you go with so this gold one was
specifically developed for a Seuss's new
gold motherboards now vengence pro is
not just for looks check this out over
here they've got the highest speed
production memory kit running here right
now this is a DDR I mean it runs at 3.2
gigahertz CL 11 so check this out right
there they've got it running right now
so remember guys DRAM frequency is half
of the actual frequency do oh you can't
see it oh so you try that one more time
are you going to be able to see it or
should I just they should just take my
word for it oh yes fine and of course
there's a memory product to announce as
well this is and of course there's a
memory product to announce as well this
is the Vengeance Pro Series which is
actually won a couple of awards already
including the best PC memory brand
silver Award for Corsair from VR zone
and what they've done here is they've
updated their vengeance line for Intel's
fourth generation Core Series processors
code-named has well so these are going
to offer perfect compatibility with has
well not only in terms of actually
functioning but also in terms of looks
even a Seuss's new Gold Series z87
motherboards are going to have a perfect
corsair memory module to go with them
they come in gold blue red and silver
and they are not just about looks guys
so we've got a demo system over here
that has another map another memory
award that they've won here from tweak
town and this system is running ddr3 3.2
gigahertz CL 11 this is running at the
stock speed of this module making it the
fastest production memory kit out there
so compared to something like Dominator
Platinum's which is traditionally the
the super high-end Corsair memory what's
the point of this well it's a simpler
module optimized for overclocking you
can expect when you buy something like a
vengence pro memory kit you're not only
getting exactly what you see on the box
but probably a little performance
headroom there as well
next up we've got the K 70 so this
keyboard this keyboard and this keyboard
are all the same except very different
they're very similar to the K 60 except
for a couple of changes so number one is
you've got these individually backlit
keys that you can also set up to have
whichever one's on or off that you want
much like the K 95 next is these are
mechanical keys now so on the K sixty
one of the complaints was that these
keys were
using rubber dome switches no longer
last but not least these look a lot
cooler than the red rubber contoured
keys that were on the K 60 so remember
guys the point of the shaped contour
here is that it allows you to easily
find your way back to WASD and easily
differentiate your keys numbers 1 to 6
but not only that Corsair has expanded
the options not only in terms of color
so there's silver black and gunmetal but
also they have expanded the options in
terms of color so you've got red key
switches as well as blue keys which is
oh yes of course they're still very
firmly believes that the red switch is
optimal for responsiveness and gaming
applications but there are people out
there like me who like gaming keyboards
but also actually do a lot more typing
than gaming so if you're one of those
guys a blue switch keyboard or yes a
brown switch keyboard my personal
favorite might be a fantastic option
last but not least there's the K 95
which isn't a new announcement by any
stretch of the imagination but what we
can say about it is that you should be
able to actually buy one unlike when we
covered this at CES so just as a
reminder this is a fully mechanical
keyboard that also has the individually
backlit feature so you can decide on
whatever pattern you want for the keys
and this one is still in Cherry MX red
we're going to wrap up the Corsair Suite
here with a couple of Mouse products so
the m-40 I'm already very familiar with
this is very similar to the m65 except
for a couple of changes that I really
feel like don't make this mouse any
worse than the m65 in spite of it being
a lower end product in the product stack
so number one is now that logo at the
back is illuminated ok score one from
forty number two is that it doesn't have
a sniper button I've never used a sniper
button in my life then again I'm not a
sniper so if those snipers out there
could tell me that I'm totally wrong
then cool that's fine too but we still
have back and forward buttons that are
perfectly positioned for people like me
if you like a little bit of a claw grip
the materials are still excellent so
you've got that high mass scroll wheel
as well as fully programmable buttons on
the fly dpi adjustments check this out
so they've removed the aluminum chassis
that illumine
bottom that makes up the mouse this this
really doesn't feel like a problem for
me because it gives you the option of an
even lighter weight when you remove all
the yes they still have adjustable
weights on this mouse so it's got your
large slippy pads it's got a 4000 dpi
sensor now which is an optical sensor
which a lot of gamers are finding they
prefer these days compared to laser and
I actually can't find something wrong
with this such that I wouldn't
wholeheartedly recommend the m-40 very
impressive product next up is the m30
which borrows the same chassis as the
lm3 so this was part of the Raptor
gaming takeover now you can see the
changes that they've made here are
mostly in terms of improving performance
so they've gone with from a 2400 dpi
sensor to a 4000 dpi sensor as well as a
couple of cosmetic and ergonomic I'd say
evolutionary changes nothing
revolutionary here so the shape is the
same but they've changed this side grip
from a ribbed texture to something
that's more of a I don't know what you
doc to GaN texture hexagon texture sure
whatever we want to call that so one way
or another it's functional for picking
up the mouse they've also changed the
finish of it I personally find glassy
mice drive me crazy maybe it's just me
who doesn't wash his hands but you get
grease all over your mouse and then
other people use it and then they get
sick because you have all kinds of
diseases it's a real problem
so they've upgraded that to a soft
touched finish they've also added an
illuminated Corsair logo which looks way
better than I mean come on is that a
logo Raptor - gaming comm it's a good
thing Corsairs taking care of this now
still got the illuminated scroll wheel
as well as a nice accented little red
finished piece here so guys don't miss
any of our Computex 2013 coverage I hope
you've enjoyed our tour of the Corsair
suite remember our trip to the show is
powered by Western Digital as well as
Corsair Vengeance gaming peripherals and
NCIX comm and as always guys don't
forget to subscribe I said that right
right yeah
can I have another dollar thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
