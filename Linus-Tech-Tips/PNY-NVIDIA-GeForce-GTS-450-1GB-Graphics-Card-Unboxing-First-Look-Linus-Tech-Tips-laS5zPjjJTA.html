the mail today so we're gonna be doing
an unboxing and then an unboxing because
this is actually just the shipping box
so if seal has been broken check
contents the seal has not been broken
but we're gonna check the contents
anyway because that's apparently my job
all right
you have broken the seals we find bubble
wrap
AHA PNY has done an excellent job of
packaging this particular graphics card
there's nothing else inside the box so
this is a GeForce GT s 450 from PNY I
don't know if this one is included
actually but hold on hold on hold on
wait for it let me check this out
warranty service huh look at that this
is interesting okay because PNY recently
updated their high-end video cards to
offer a lifetime warranty and I wasn't
really sure if a mid-range video card
like this would be included in that
policy but while they are not offering a
lifetime warranty they do have a
five-year warranty which is actually
excellent for a mid-range card like this
I mean this is only a 149 139 ish sort
of graphics card and that's uh that's
outstanding actually so we'll have a
quick look at the features overall of
this card it's a 783 megahertz core
clock as 192 processor cores it has a
one point five six six gigahertz
processor clock okay so remember that's
double the core clock alright and then
we've got one gig of gddr5 you can
actually read all the specs here if you
so desire the more important things on a
card like this are actually features
because this is part of nvidia x'
DirectX lineup of cards it's like I said
a mainstream level card so it's
positioned under the GTX 460 but it does
still come with all the Nvidia features
that means you got cuda physics sli 3d
vision capability even though they don't
have 3d vision listed here they should
including 3d vision surround so that is
if you run two of these cards in sli you
will have full support for their Attis
3d vision surround the camera man is
trying to burn me
again let's see what we've got in terms
of games that they're demoing here so
they've got civilization 5 is really
pitched as a card as a game that will
run great on the DTS 450 they've also
got mafia 2 if you're running at non HD
resolution so anything about 1680 by
1050 or lower this card actually
performs admirably well in mafia 2 so
that's another pretty cool one and that
includes running with physics on which
provides a much much better gameplay
experience in a game like that than
trying to run without physics oh this is
cool - check this up this is a promotion
that PNY has been running for quite a
while but they actually include two
bonus movie downloads so if you check
out PNY dot-com slash movies you can see
which movies you can get for free with
this video card oh yeah there it is
five-year warranty that wouldn't have
been that hard to find if I had looked
for it more carefully and you know what
here here is a special - tech tips
promotional offer I'm just gonna take
apart the box okay okay okay
whoever sees this first so that means
you smart guy who writes the first
comment right there oh he looks at the
other one okay well there's a Starcraft
2 trial ok and then there's the two
bonus movie downloads and then if you
really want a three-month subscription
to ESEA then you can have that too so
there we go
yeah a promotional excitement online of
tech tips free stuff all right here we
go inside this is kind of a new way of
doing packaging for PNY I haven't seen
this before nice black internal blocks
and then it looks like it comes in like
a little a little bubble thing here so
okay hold on
first let's slip it over this way I
guess so we see the accessories first of
all we have a mini HDMI to HDMI adapter
then we have a dual 4-pin molex to 6-pin
PCI II power adapter and then a DVI to
VGA adapter if you're still running an
old monitor and someone was all
indignant about me saying that VGA
monitors are old well they are if your
monitor only has VGA then it's old you
can see here they've got the tube 59.2 2
graphics drivers throw this away because
Nvidia just released their new 260
Series drivers which provide better
performance for the GTS 450
here is a quick start guide okay and
then let's have a look at the card
itself so this one features a blue PCB
as well as the Nvidia stock reference
cooler so I'm gonna have a closer look
at the reference cooler because PNY does
typically release reference boards and
I'll explain what reference mean that
means they haven't done a redesign of
the PCB layout but rather they are
manufacturing based on nvidia z'
recommended layout for the ran the core
everything else that goes on the video
card itself including in this case the
cooler so let's have a look at the back
here you can see we've got four RAM
chips here there are gonna be four RAM
chips on the other side so that means
that that's your one gig of gddr5
although it looks like we do have
support for up to four more RAM chips so
potentially PNY could release a 1.5 gig
or a 768 Meg version of this card in the
future here if whoo we've got the SLI
connector so this card supports up to
2-way SLI
down at the bottom you can see a curious
thing that I also noticed on the MSI 450
card you can see that some of the traces
here do not terminate in two pings so it
looks like this part is able to run at
PCI Express 16 X that means hole pcie
2.0 bandwidth without all of the pins
that's not not an aspect of PCIe
technology that I was aware of but there
you go here we've got two DVI ports and
one mini HDMI remember you can only use
two of these at a time that means either
dual DVI or one DVI one mini HDMI one
DVI one mini HDMI here we have an
exhaust vent and this is something that
I want to point out about this
particular card because as I said uses
the reference cooler that means that
probably about with this shroud about
half of the airflow coming out of this
card is going to be exhausted from the
case and then maybe about another half
is going to come down from the fan and
be exhausted out the back of the shroud
so that means that it's a good
compromise between something like a
normal blower heatsink where you
actually have to position the fan way
over here you don't get quite that same
efficiency as when you're blowing air
right
on to the core and something like the
MSI cyclone cooler where yeah you're
putting heat pipes and everything all
over it but you're exhausting the hot
air into your case so yeah like I said
it's a compromise and it's one that
personally I can live with here on the
back of the card we find a 6-pin pci ii
power connector as well as a four pin
pwm fan controller so that means this
fan should be quite quiet although we
will do some testing with this against
the MSI cyclone cooler in the coming
days up here we find pn wise branding as
you can see this is a reference shroud
so that means that it's just a sticker
on top of it and i think that covers
pretty much everything in terms of the
unboxing of the PNY GTS 450 and we will
have more to come including some SLI
numbers for the 450 now that I have my
second one now I think I actually
glossed over this too fast as I was
boxing the card back up I noticed just
how ingenious this packaging method is
so PNY has actually gone in custom
designed a plastic shroud II thing that
looks like it can fit any number of
graphics cards all you've got is here a
little stopper here I'm actually gonna
take the top cover off here so you've
got a little stopper right here that
keeps it from sliding back and forth and
then you've got a little hook right here
where the PCI Express retention clip
sits so it can't slide back see that it
can't slide forward because of this one
here where that little that little knob
goes into so it can't slide back you
can't slide forward it has this top
cover piece on it that gives it like a
cushion of air all the way around the
card so even if the Box gets just like
hammered on in shipping the card will be
completely safe and yeah it doesn't use
any of that non biodegradable foam or
anything like that a solution like this
keeps the card completely safe from any
kind of static damage that could happen
like when foam is rubbing against itself
I mean there is anti-static foam but
it's probably more expensive
anyway I think this is just one of the
more clever ways I've ever seen a video
card package so I thought I'd just kind
of give PNY a quick kudos on moving
forward in terms of video card packaging</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
