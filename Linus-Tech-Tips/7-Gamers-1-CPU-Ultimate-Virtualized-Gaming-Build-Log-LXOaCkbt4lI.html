to introduce the topic of the video but
as you can tell today there's
legitimately no room for me because this
is by far the highest end machine that I
have ever built and the hardware barely
even fits on the table but what does
this build for - you've been teasing
this thing on social media for weeks
well inspired by our to gamers one CPU
build back in whenever the heck we did
that this is taking it to the next level
Michael Bay's sequel style we are doing
seven gamers running off of one tower
but before we begin I should tell you
something and that is that I
legitimately don't know if this is going
to work at this time now I mean we've
done some pre-testing we've got four VMs
working with you know the performance
you'd expect from an AMD radeon r9 nano
and a quad core gaming processor but we
have no way of testing seven until we
install all the custom water-cooling and
get the whole thing assembled so without
further ado a huge thanks to Kingston
for sponsoring this video
providing 256 gigs of their kick-ass
ddr4 ECC memory providing eight one
terabyte SSD so all those gaming VMs
have nice high speed storage and for
demoing this machine at their booth at
CES 2016 so if you're there at the show
definitely go check it out you can see
it in person let's get started
you
so it's 24 hours later and if I look
like I haven't slept much it's probably
because I didn't but it's totally worth
it
it's working so I'm gonna take you guys
through the journey now that I know that
it's successful of how we created seven
gamers one CPU it starts I guess
actually with the CPU or I should say
CPUs because there isn't a CPU on the
market that could deliver a full-on
high-end gaming experience to seven
gamers all at the same time so our
system is equipped with two Intel Xeon
e5 26.97
v3 processors so these are 14 core
processors that are clocked at up to 3.6
gigahertz when they're turbo as high as
they can actually have hyper threading
as well for a total of 56 threads
meaning that each of our VMs has four
cores and four hyper threads just like
you would if you were running on
something like a core i5 or a core i7
normal desktop processor for our
motherboard obviously we needed
something that could hold both of these
CPUs and seven graphics cards so the
Asus z10 PE d 8 WS is one of the only
standard form factor boards that would
fit in like a gaming case that is
capable of carrying seven GPUs two
sockets for the CPUs and that can hold
all of the RAM that we need and there's
got some other key features as well so
it has a VGA output for our unread
console it's got enough SATA ports for
us to throw in as many SSDs and hard
drives as we pretty much want it can
handle a total of 12 out of the box
and it's got an N dot 2 slot on it which
could be useful in the future as like a
cache for the array onto RAM actually
kingston hooked us the crap up for this
machine and sent us because we could
only have eight sticks of memory in this
board they hooked us up with 32 gig
sticks of ddr4 ECC Ram what that means
is each of our gamers can have 32 gigs
of ram for a zero compromises gaming
experience for the case we went with a
case labs s8 and we did this for a
number of reasons so first and foremost
actually is that pretty much nothing
else on the market was going to work for
us so we needed something that supported
our extended ATX motherboard and this
one has an optional tray available and
in addition to that because there's lots
of server cases out there that would
support this motherboard we needed
support for water cooling so it's got
lots of room for radiators pumps
reservoirs all of that good stuff not to
mention it's got room for all the hard
drives we need and it's got a full
aluminum construction so it's actually
fairly lightweight considering all the
hardware we have in there and personally
I think it looks pretty badass with the
selection of windowed and mesh panels
that we chose for our particular rig not
only that the case labs also hooked us
up on a sweet black and orange powder
coat paint job that I think looks
fan-freaking-tastic for our power supply
again we didn't have a ton of choices
because doing quick napkin math I
figured this rig was going to pull
anywhere from 1500 watts or more from
the wall when it was under max load so
EVGA hooked us up with their t2 1600
watt power supply yes my friends it is
80-plus titanium and capable of a
continuous load of 1600 watts and then
to make it look even more badass
capel mod hooked us up with a black and
orange cable set to just kind of trick
this baby out and even some custom
cables so we could run single eight pin
connectors to each of our video cards
making the whole thing come together
just mmm
then that's beautiful and I'll tell you
how close I was to that 1500 watt number
a little bit later on in the video
now I've water-cooled a lot of systems
before in the past I have never done one
with this many blocks before fortunately
as far as the CPU went it was really
straightforward I really liked e KS
mounting mechanism here
we're using their supremacy Evo's with
nickel tops to match some of the other
nickel accents in our system and the GPU
blocks actually fairly straightforward
as well too straightforward it's kind of
therapeutic for me water cooling systems
these days because it's like you know
that's my old hobby like it's relaxing
for me but after seven GPU blocks in a
row I was definitely ready for a new
challenge and fortunately that's exactly
what was waiting for me Ek custom
designed and manufactured this seven
block connector / splitter thing that
went on top of our GPUs effectively
transforming them into a block on seven
graphics cards that were could be
installed in one fell swoop into all
seven of the PCIe slots on the
motherboard this was the only way that
we were going to be able to fit not just
a bunch of graphics cards into a system
but a bunch of high-end gaming cards
into a system which leads us I guess to
the radiators because you got a cool a
bunch of high-end gaming cards in one
system so we went with two of their
high-end super thick XE series triple
120 millimeter radiators and then we're
using on my LT t edition not to a fans
to cool them and then the original plan
was to use one d5 pump connected to one
of their reservoirs and mount that in
the front that didn't end up working I
actually had a number of challenges and
things were overheating and I was trying
to turn the system on and I ended up
actually having to add another pump to
the system in order to get this baby
working because we're talking nine
blocks right to CPU blocks seven GPU
blocks to make this thing happen so
let's talk about those GPUs that was
another careful decision for this system
I originally planned to use something
else entirely realized it wasn't going
to work because even though I could get
single slot blocks on them
I couldn't adjust the back plates and
they had display interfaces in
two of the slots so I was gonna go with
the theory X and then I realized oh no
it's going to draw too much power
there's the power supply on earth that's
going to be able to handle seven of
these so the the AMD r9 nano saved my
bacon
the efficient gaming card that thermal
throttles unfortunately with its stock
cooler in a normal sized case yeah we
took care of that all GPUs all the time
no throttling high-end gaming card super
efficient and something I didn't even
foresee because the card is short I'm
actually able to get it the PCIe locks
so that I can remove the cards from the
system in the event that I need to do
that any other card and I probably
wouldn't be able to pull the cards out
so at the end of the build I actually
realized Kingston's are our sponsor for
this and I didn't have mounting adaptors
for my SSDs so I went for the
double-sided tape
bippity boppity boop I made a stack of
SSDs on the bottom that I actually think
ended up looking pretty badass booted it
up it kind of cycled a few times I
experienced a moment of unparalleled
despair when I thought that okay we went
from because we originally tested it
with four GPUs we went from four GPUs
kind of working to Oh No seven doesn't
post and then it turned on we needed a
few BIOS tweaks to make this happen over
4G decoding setting the default video
output to the onboard video making sure
our boot device was the USB Drive for
unread and then it was off to the races
in terms of software truthfully we
didn't have to do a whole lot
differently from to gamers one CPU on
the software side of things you're still
using on raid to manage our pooled
storage so in this case it's eight of
Kingston's shiny new one terabyte KC 400
series drives running in a RAID 10 for
Hyper reliability and enough
mean to run set of freaking computers
off of them at the same time and then we
had to do like this funny you know guess
and check thing for assigning keyboards
and mice to VMs because a lot of USB
device manufacturers don't correctly
label them so we just had to kind of
unplug and plug things in and run around
and move them around so we got this
whole thing working and then well okay
there were a bunch of other problems but
I'm not going to bore all of you guys
with that but I will tell you about one
cool trick that we used to save some
space on our SSDs and make room for more
games and applications for each of our
gamers and that's a a snapshotting like
feature of butter FS that allowed us to
create one of our virtual hard disks and
then clone it kind of like a shortcut in
Windows for all of the other six so none
of those files get replicated and what
cool about that is even if you delete
you know this file or that one the file
system is smart enough to know not to
actually eliminate the data so that
everyone can access it very very cool so
if one person on installs a program it
does not install it for everybody which
leads us finally to testing it works
thank goodness it works not everything
is possible for me to capture
unfortunately some of our GPUs are not
reading their temperatures correctly
there are there are some quirks but I
can tell you guys this our idle power
consumption is 250 watts yes our idle
power consumption is as much as a
mid-range gaming machine under load and
our load power consumption from the wall
is 1500 watts when running seven
instances of Unigine heaven which you
guys can see going on behind me and have
another cool fact for you as well
we actually got 3dmark fire strike
scores that were 800 points higher per
VM than we did running the cards
air-cooled yes my friends that is the
power of custom liquid
Elayne so I think that pretty much wraps
it up other than to do a quick I'm
actually surprising my camera operator
with this but I'm gonna do a quick proof
proof that it is all real my friends all
right so we sat through the incredibly
boring intro cinematic for Crysis 3 and
this is it
this is the real deal gaming experience
of the 7 gamers one CPU machine and you
might ask yourselves well Linus why did
you go to all the effort to put all
these 34 inch Predator X 34 monitors on
here because what I wanted to demo was
that you can't just have a gaming
experience seven times on this machine
you can have the gaming experience seven
times on this machine my friends we're
talking 30 for 40 by 1440 ultra wide IPS
and yes that framerate counter in the
top right is accurate this game is
running at anywhere from about 60 to
upwards of a hundred frames per second
and all my instances if you want to just
look up all my instances of Unigine
heaven are still running in the
background gonna be smooth baby not a
hitch except for that I just ended up in
the same room that I started it it
doesn't make you any better at games
unfortunately so thank you for watching
seven gamers one CPU a demonstration of
what the technology is capable of
however impractical something like this
might be and I don't expect any of you
to run out and build a system that costs
literally as much as a decent brand-new
car for something like this but if
nothing else it is proof that we have
the technology thanks again for watching
