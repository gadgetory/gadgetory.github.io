brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steel series well here at the course
our booth we're going to check out what
they're announcing for mouse pads and
keyboards so first up is the Corsair mm
200 extended this is more of a desk pad
and less of a mouse pad you can see if
you wanted to you could probably have
four individual people operating mice
within normal ranges on this mouse pad
or you can put your keyboard here and
your mouse over here and not have to
deal with that annoying lip that tends
to exist at the edge of your keyboard
where it overlaps a little bit is really
frustrating next up we've got the MM 400
compact which is just a smaller version
of the existing mm 400 so that's pretty
much it for things that you didn't
already see from our computex coverage
now we're over on the other side where
there's the new Raptor k30 so from the
Raptor branding that should tell you
that it's more of a value-oriented
option compared to vengeance but I think
given the price you guys are probably
going to like the features of this
keyboard so it has the same aesthetic as
the Vengeance keyboards however it does
use plastic construction and membrane
keys versus aluminum construction with
mechanical keys but it still got back
lighting it's still got a variety of
different brightness levels it still got
programmable keys with three different
banks over here a lockable Windows key
and dedicated media keys so when you
look at what it's up against that makes
it look pretty compelling actually if
you're looking for a more value oriented
keyboard personally I prefer mechanical
though which actually is fantastic
because right over there we've got
course they're showing off their cherry
MX blue and cherry MX brown vengeance
series gaming keyboards which are
available for pre-order now and are
going to be shipping by the end of the
month so for all of those of you who are
asking when are they coming when are
they coming they are finally coming now
be excited guys don't miss any of our
pax prime 2013 coverage huge thanks to
our sponsors Western Digital Intel and
steelseries for allowing us to be here
at the show and as always don't forget
