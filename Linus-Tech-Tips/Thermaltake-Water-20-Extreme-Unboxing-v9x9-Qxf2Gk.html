to my unboxing and first look at the
thermaltake water 2 point 0 extreme this
is different from the big water SE that
was my first water cooling kit so I'm
actually going to take the approach with
this unboxing of comparing the water 2
point 0 extreme to how far thermaltake
has come in like the last eight years in
terms of their pre done liquid cooling
kits because let me tell you the big
water SE was no easier to install than a
custom loop it didn't really perform
that well but it looked really cool and
used quarter inch tubing so it was like
not performance parts i mean the water
block on that thing was like it had a
channel like this and that was like it
it was still way better than air though
and it got me it was like sort of like
that first hit that gets you into
something like school just obviously
what we were talking about so let's have
a look at what thermaltake has to say
for themselves first top-of-the-line
liquid cooler equipped with power and
performance no refills needed their
advantage over big water SE which came
with like jugs of coolant and you had to
actually like fill it and then drain it
and then refill it and top it up and
stuff like that 240 millimeter radiator
doubles the cooling surface I can tell
you it more than doubles the cooling
ability versus the big water se because
that one was 120 ml and it had the worst
radiator design I've probably ever seen
in a liquid cooling unit I'm not trying
to rag on thermaltake it's an old
product at this point but man that thing
had one tube that went through like this
so the flow restriction of that radiator
was terrible it also had like one of the
densest thin arrays that I've ever seen
and this one does not have that
universal socket compatibility okay that
the big water had but the mounting
mechanism wasn't too great
high-performance copper base plate
accelerates the heat conductivity high
reliability low profile pump based on an
ASA tech design so you know it's not
going to die or anything like that
pre-filled cool introduces the liquid
replenishment hassle low evaporation to
reduces the loss of coolant and the high
tech sealed circulation system prevents
leaking issues double okay hi
pump high-efficiency radiator powerful
cooling fans there are two and fan
control software included which is nice
to see inside the box we have a manual
which is in a bajillion different
languages including mode d'emploi or dog
toy I don't know my French is kind of
rusty thank control software version 1.3
very nice to see thermaltake fans
thermal takes been doing fans for a
while so I figured they'd probably know
a thing or two about it pwm fan so pwm
control is always nice to have
especially if you're going to be
programming fan control curves or
whatever else like that because voltage
fans voltage control DC fans can be a
bit of an issue if you set a very low
fan speed they might not start for
example so PWM fans always are running
12 volts through the fan but it just
sends it in bursts so that it has enough
torque to start the fan pretty much no
matter what mounting hardware included a
Sutekh hob has done so much of a better
job on the mounting hardware versus
previous generation products this clip
right here is like the magic clip
because it used to be you had to take
the block what's this product warranty
policy okay good hmm this looks like it
uses a thicker radiator than most of the
other 240 ml products out there that's
kind of interesting imma be back in just
a moment here with with a corsair h100i
where is my h100i it's over here
somewhere here we go
I think it uses a thicker radiator and a
thicker radiator would go a long way
towards increasing the overall surface
area because guys liquid cooling is not
is not magic it's just the liquid more
efficiently moves the heat away from the
cpu and towards the heat dissipate or
the radiator so in this case you can see
aha like this okay so the big water two
point O which are the big ones now I'm
doing doing that the water two point O
has a very very very loose fin
arrangement which is great for quiet
operation compared to the corsair h100i
which is more dense so if you did ramp
up the RPMs of the fans this kind of
design would start to pull ahead of this
kind of design where you can see the
water channels are spaced more closely
for more effective heat conduction to
the fins themselves but check this out
the water two point O has a
significantly thicker radiator than the
h100i that means that even though they
are both 2 x 120 millimeter water
cooling units this one is probably
clapping that must be like at least
twenty to thirty percent thicker which
won't give you quite the same advantage
as for example a dual one hundred and
forty millimeter radiator but it'll fit
in more cases because it's 2 x 120
although some cases will have trouble
with it because it is thicker if you
have any clearance issues with your
mosfet coolers or anything like that
that might be a problem but it gives you
more surface area so that's good that's
something i didn't know about the water
2 point 0 until I opened it up here I'm
just going to put that away um marine
right the mounting mechanism so it
includes a high-quality thermal compound
on the base here and all we're going to
do is remove the the cover i'm going to
show you guys what's so much better
about this so you used to have to just
take this thing and like hold it on to
the retention ring and then like thread
some screws through it and all that now
you just take this guy clip it on oh I'm
really excited about this cooler now and
I was excited before but now I'm now I'm
really excited I was all nostalgic about
my big water SC now I'm all like oh I
don't need that anymore just use a water
two point oh just like better with thick
radiator anyway the point is that if you
have two hands and you're not trying to
sort of lino
like this to do it you just clip this
piece on here then you take all of the
mounting screws clip them through here
with the included plastic brackets the
instructions will cover all this and it
is quite straightforward so you don't
have to hold everything in place while
you're fumbling around with it inside
your computer case because a lot of
people do upgrade existing computers
with these pre done liquid cooling kits
in terms of connectivity you're going to
find pretty much what you'd expect so
the cpu block / pump unit itself has
here we go a USB connector so this is
how you access the fan control software
or that's how you interface with the
with the unit through the fan control
software it has two black harnesses
coming off of it for the 24 pin pwm fans
these are all using black wires which is
going to look way nicer in your case
then the the older generation products
that did not use all black wires and
finally a 3-pin connector for the fan
pump itself which is inside the
waterblock unit I don't know if I
mentioned I don't know if I showed the
thermal compound that is pre-installed
so that looks like the same kind that
pretty much everyone uses it's really
good stuff I've actually tried replacing
this with aftermarket stuff unless
you're using really high-end aftermarket
stuff you're not going to see any
temperature improvement so I always use
the pre applied one on the first
installation I think that pretty much
covers it it's using quarter inch tubing
although i'm not entirely sold on
three-eighths inch tubing making that
much of a difference in terms of
performance we actually ran the h100
versus the h100i and we only saw what
was it like a two degree difference or
something like that I think was only a
couple degree difference using the same
fans which could have just as easily
been improvements to the cpu block and
not necessarily any improvement from
going from one quarter inch to three
eighths inch tubing I mean the
three-eighths inch tubing looks baller
but it actually doesn't have quite the
same type Bend radius as quarter inch
tubing does I think that pretty much
covers it for the water to point o make
sure you're subscribed to line is tech
tips so that you see our performance
review where we're actually going to
take the water to point o and find out
how much of a performance advantage that
thicker radiator gives it when we put a
high quality pressure optimized silent
fan on it and of course be subscribed
