are restarting due to some technical
difficulties so you'll have to bear with
us we've got a lot of great topics for
this week the HP lead x3 leaked a
Hollywood Hospital succumbs to a hacker
to a hacker and the federal judge orders
Apple to help the FBI decrypt an iPhone
5c Apple responds with an open letter oh
yeah the last thing is the Pentagon
orders windows tend to be installed on
approximately four million devices by
January 2017 that's cruzi yeah that's
crazy
well guess why that's crazy later in the
meantime I'm gonna roll the intro but
bow or maybe they do want a redo of
Windows XP where they run it forever so
they just like okay it has been 15 years
we are ready to run a different
operating system for the next 15 years
and for some reason we've decided today
we
there are a lot of things I like about
Windows 10 but there are certainly some
that I do not okay
so let's kick this off for those of you
watching live on Twitch we're wondering
what the heck just happened there where
I was literally mid-sentence literally
not touching anything well that was my
life in a nutshell I stand here totally
innocently hands-off everything doing
absolutely nothing wrong and stuff dies
so this is the graphics card that was in
the wind show PC before we started
streaming today for some reason the
shroud is like oh wow which is not a
thing that it was like before
so that's confusing this is a five 550
ti that is no longer good so I'm gonna
go ahead and you know find out what's
inside it what the heck is not that
shroud I don't know like I don't
understand pieces of plastic falling out
of it I don't understand what's holding
this piece on and I don't understand
what made this piece fall off well like
something broke there's like chunks of
plastic falling out of it but the thing
about that is that no it hasn't been
touched since it was installed and no
one ever touched the graphics card that
a hard core right there there we go
oh yeah so they clip on to the to the
heatsink itself I guess so let's just
had enough of your crap 550 ti I'm
trying to trying to do it without like
breaking it pretty pink it's kind of
dead I know it's kind of dead but it's
only kind of dead maybe that's part of
the problem maybe sometimes I just have
too much faith in in hardware's ability
to be like only sort of dead I should
just kind of go okay we got one driver
crash that's it
time for the bin also I'm sitting in a
chair that some moron tilted the base of
it like way back so I'm like sitting
with my legs up like this basically like
in like my body's in like a v-shape and
it's making my back hurt so I'm in
Akintola foul mood today but that's okay
because it's all about you guys and we
have a stream to do so damn it in the
twitch channels are doing a stream
virtually arcing you are they virtually
hugging me thank you
you know what twitch chat you should
okay so we've already named their news
alright so federal judge orders Apple to
help the FBI decrypt the San Bernardino
killers iPhone 5c Apple responds with an
open letter to their customers that is
obviously also intended to address the
FBI's demands so this was posted
originally by blaze 756 in the forum I'm
gonna go ahead and pop up that message a
message to our customers on apple.com
the United States government has
demanded that Apple take an
unprecedented step which threatens the
security of our customers we oppose this
order which has implement k2
implications far beyond the legal case
at hand because on the surface this all
looks very reasonable okay we need to
get some information off of this killers
phone in order to better investigate the
case or whatever it is they need to do
I'm frankly once you kill someone you
kind of as far as I'm concerned you're
kind of fair game you know if someone
needs to snoop around in your stuff to
find out how many people you've been
killing or how you killed them or where
you put the bodies then I think you kind
of give up your you give that up at that
point um
but Apple makes a good point what the
FBI is effectively asking them to do is
build in a backdoor so they're asking
Apple to make a new version of iOS
circumventing several important security
features and then they want to install
it on an iPhone recovered during the
investigation so in the wrong hands this
software which does not exist would have
the potential to unlock any iPhone in
someone's physical possession because
that is a really interesting point the
iPhone and iOS the one way that you
could break into it would be an iOS
update yeah that does not have the
security features that Apple believes
should be in there
so Apple actually made a choice in 2014
to remove itself from being able to
access encrypted devices so that means
if you know grandpa you know Joe and
grandma Jill or whatever one of them
dies and the other one can't get into
the phone or the iPad Apple straight-up
cannot decrypt the device um and you
know there's a there's a lot of
arguments to be made on both side
personally I totally respect that yeah I
think respecting the users privacy is
the right thing for Apple to do
especially in the context of what their
competitors are doing whether it's
Microsoft or Google where it's all about
collecting customer information collect
collect collect monetize all that stuff
I think that's one of Apple's truly
differentiating points in the
marketplace today and like a really good
one and I found this kind of weird for a
while and I'm happy that the tech
community tech community seems to be
getting behind Apple for this because
for a long time we've been kind of
talking on stuff like the land show
about that you know really horrible
Android security and like all these
other giant security problems than
Apple's just sitting over there with
like kind of a great ecosystem in terms
of security and things and whatnot and
everyone hates on them everyone loves to
bring up the fappening but that was not
an apple encryption breach no that was
that was social engineering allowing
people to get their hands on someone
else's data which which they're honestly
know no amount of ain't nothing Apple
can do can can prevent that now see it's
already twitch as
yeah we know we know people are like
Luke looks so tired yeah I don't even
understand why it's been such a long
week like it just has everything I've
done has just been hard this week oh
yeah I'm like this is my 10th video
because for for tech quickies one
channel super fun right theoretically
for LCD you see I didn't even get that
much done in one way and yeah so there
you go anyway so where are we at here
doo doo doo doo
like I said John the tech cookies
weren't that hard but like it's it's
still a lot of stuff and like the one -
tech tips that isn't done yet oh yeah I
mean it's possible that a few of the
people that are helping me or even
watching right now I'm just like oh yeah
wow that's gonna be a fun series to
update in the future anyway back to the
the Apple thing Apple has several days
before it has to file a formal response
the Justice Department says that Apple's
defensive encryption is just a marketing
stunt which I totally do not agree that
that is the case at all
and if neither side is happy with
Apple's response the case will be
escalated to the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit and could escalate as
far as the supreme court taking up to
several years this is great
Donald Trump you are the man Donald
Trump calls for an Apple boycott until
they respond until they decrypt the
phone basically it's like okay a you've
clearly shown that you don't understand
what the larger issue is here and B I
think that's probably that's about it
I I genuinely think that there is a very
good chance he will be President though
really I really do
we'll see I truly do I don't know enough
about American politics
speaking of presidential candidates this
was supposed to by Sam Fisher on the
forum original article here is from the
BBC and John McAfee has offered to
decrypt the phone says he only needs
three weeks and he will use social
engineering in order to do so and he is
also I didn't even know this but also
apparently running for president as a
libertarian what yeah um hold on a
second let me just so if you guys don't
know who John McAfee is you probably
should you know that annoying software
which by the way he has nothing to do
with anymore he left the company ages
ago but that McAfee software that's him
he made you know commercial antivirus
for basically the first time I think is
is his sort of claim to fame he's kind
of crazy yeah I'm a very entertaining
way yeah he's kind of crazy so I mean
he's he's got that at least he's got
some of the right ideas here though
that's for sure he's keen to unlock the
device himself because he doesn't want
Apple to have to implement a backdoor
and I mean this is a this is a really
good point from Tim Cook and he says the
government suggests this tool could only
be used once on one phone but that's not
true once created this technique could
be used over and over again on any
number of devices in the physical world
it would be the equivalent of a master
key capable of opening hundreds of
millions of locks no reasonable person
would find that acceptable and I agree
with them 100%
apparently so does John McAfee so he
basically says if Apple creates this
tool and implements this backdoor it
will be the beginning of the end for
America that's maybe a little rare which
is
a little much but maybe maybe a little
bit sensationalist but says also that he
will eat his shoe on television if they
can't break the encryption on the phone
so there's that anyway here here's the
McAfee 2016 page just in case you were
curious
I don't think cath I don't think anyone
is actually planning to vote from me
that's his website so bad I what that
uninstall the system Wow wow that looks
horrible pretty sure this is a joke I
may be wrong though cuz I legitimately I
legitimately hadn't heard that he was
running and I legitimately cannot
possibly believe that this is true I'm
sure that twitch chat is I'm sure twitch
chat is exploding right now but people
saying I'd vote for I'd vote from pack
of me you should love you guys all right
what's going on there I don't know I
don't know why is life hard hi
why do you mean
oh okay all right it's settled down all
right
everybody needs to just settle down okay
thank you I hate this I hate today
I just want to go to bed I just want to
go to sleep and be done with today which
I'm not gonna be able to do because I
need to fix that server after work today
so all right this is good this was
posted by ragnarok Adele
my back is so sore from sitting in this
chair like this switch I know it's okay
because I want the pain right now
because the pain will fuel my anger for
after the show when I go and find
whoever set it up like this take their
chair away from them rip it out from
under them and put this chair under them
so that they can experience what they
have done that is why I want to sit in
the chair so the Pentagon orders Windows
tend to be installed on all four million
of its pcs by 2017 so if your company
hasn't yet upgraded to Windows 10 your
AI dee' IT department is quickly running
out of excuses actually I can think of a
lot of excuses um dude should we take
turns coming up with excuses you want
the low-hanging fruit go for search yeah
go for it
search so you basically can't find
anything ever on a computer that's
running over there
I needed to install heaven benchmark
just because I I needed heaven benchmark
I installed it and then typed heaven in
the Start menu and nothing came up okay
this is a fantastic demo this is my
favorite Windows 10 search is terrible
and this is this is I'm talking when the
Start menu opens we've got a couple
machines here in the office that have
issues with the Start menu even opening
like oh yes yeah yeah it's a global I
know yeah on my machine upstairs what I
usually have to do to search for
something is click Cortana once then
click it and Skype what part of what I
did
sounded like I'd like to talk to you
right now all right
so what I have to do is I have to click
it once
then again and then I can click the
start menu and I can get that open okay
so get this okay so this is a great tool
Rufus for creating bootable thumb drives
so alright you've got a lot of great
suggestions here our Rufus Rufus
Wainwright yeah I heard there was a
secret chord that Microsoft played and
it made their Start menus work
internally so they apparently aren't
aware of these bugs just playing Rufus
here we go Rufus USB Rufus and mer jog
whatever that oh look at this oh oh it
did find a search result on my computer
that's weird why did it find the folder
but not at all why there was something I
was looking for on my computer I don't I
can't say the name cuz it'll spoil the
video that's coming up but I typed in
the name of the program that I needed
and it gave me the config file and not
the executable I was just like why I've
ran the executable so many times and
I've never read the config file like
it's just frustrating cuz Windows 8 it
works fine Windows 7 I can search for
Rufus I'm very sorry you guys I just
realized I accidentally killed all of
the entire thing we don't know the
compressor is the compressors not
working sorry for screaming sorry for
screaming anyway I'm up I'm upset about
that because I searched for Rufus a lot
because I never remember where I put it
and apparently I'm kylo Ren his voice is
the unstable lightsaber yes thank you
this is my mask this is my I'm tired man
as I'm posting the rest of the winch oh
all right anyway so this will be the
largest deployment of Windows 10 since
its released six months ago and
represents a huge milestone for
Microsoft because if there is anyone
that it is difficult to get to upgrade
their their Windows operating systems it
is the military so the funny thing about
this is a lot of the machine
being upgraded are gonna be Windows XP
machines or newer machines that are
running in Windows XP just for the lulz
yeah so the upgrade will include Windows
hello which is their biometric security
system that's embedded into the OS that
allows you to use fingerprint scanners
or even retinal scanners or sign into
Windows or yes it actually allows you to
use a variety of different
authentication methods yeah I kind of
feel like Windows hello hasn't been
vetted to the point where I would want
it deployed in a military application
but evaded I doubt it yeah well sorry
usually I can like I can contain yawns
for the sake of having something
resembling a modicum of professionalism
throughout this show but I am just
bushwhacked like my whole family got
sick this week between you did it might
know I was going to ask you earlier
today if you go so between my son and
daughter and wife there were probably
somewhere between 15 and 20 upchucks in
the last three days like everyone was
sick my aunt got sick our babysitter got
sick I am still not sick but my aunt was
saying apparently this bugs you can stay
contagious seven days after you stop
showing symptoms
so there is still plenty of time for me
to get hit by it but let's go ahead and
talk about and talk about this it's kind
of there's kind of a big deal the HP
Latex three weeks before Mobile World
Congress this is supposed to by casual
gamer on the forum let's go ahead and
pull up the WM power user and dot-com
Windows Mobile power user com
that's the kind of site that you start
thinking like some day Microsoft will
get their crap together and there will
be someone who wants to visit this site
Oh anyway
this does look like a pretty darn cool
little device it features a Snapdragon
820 processor four gigs of ram 32 gigs
of storage - up to 200 gigs have
expandable microSD storage ip67 water
and dust resistance I'm a 16 megapixel
rear camera take a look at the front
camera oh yes here's this is where it
gets really interesting so it's got a
Type C USB 3.0 connector on the bottom
and apparently support for continuum so
if you don't remember what continuum is
because Microsoft talked about it and
then promptly there was nothing thing
used it so we all forgot about it
continuum allows you to have the desktop
ish experience with your mobile device
by using a USB type-c adapter to go out
to HDMI or some kind of a display output
to a full-size monitor and even breakout
to USB input devices like a keyboard and
mouse pretty freakin six so because
there is an arm compatible version of
Office what you could do is you could
actually work on like office documents
on your keyboard and mouse save all your
work to your phone unplug bippity bop
off you go and you can use it as a phone
continuum also allows you I mean this is
all in theory I've never personally used
it also allows you to use your phone as
a touchpad if for whatever reason you
are one of the bizarre human beings who
uses a touchpad when they're at their
desktop as they're like for some reason
to do that I do too and people are like
yeah gestures you know here's a gesture
this is called the right finger down
gesture brings up the contextual menu a
lot faster than you know touch and hold
and people are like oh but like gestures
and I'm like here's a gesture it's
called shortcut keys on your keyboard
like keyboard shortcuts yeah thank you
keyboard shortcuts um some people would
get that oh right oh yeah people are
upset we're not posting the links in
chat
I forgot and apparently you forgot
anyway we're sorry we're sorry we saw
we're terrible all the way guys can you
guys can hate on us all you want be
completely honest I know you're in like
everything has to suck right now mode
but that that is my job okay but that's
okay that doesn't help me everything
sucks now you suck I had faith in you
haha all you've done is drag me down
even more now way to go Luke no it's
okay I'm not mad I'm just disappointed
this is a cool topic so this was posted
by kami SH SS on the forum and it is the
ringing bells freedom 251 smartphone I'm
gonna pull up the gadget NT Dendy TV
calm article here this is by far that
okay Wow wow I have never seen a pop-up
like this site will open in five seconds
if you do not click it away it clicks on
the pop-up for you that is awesome you
are a terrible terrible sight gadget 360
look at the ads oh man whoa Wow
providers okay with Wow all right down
Wow
ads on the side and then all the sudden
is just like
Wow 10 Canadian dating sites that really
work I want to know what those Canadian
dating sites are I've never even heard
of that top 7 get that right even the
web sites called top 10 I'm just
disappointed Ashley Madison isn't on
here so yeah I'm pretty much done with
that now all right so here we go ringing
bells is set to officially unveil the
freedom 251 smartphone so the price is
because it costs 251 I believe RS is
rupees because this is in India I'm
fairly sure that they also have the
rupee in India we also have the rupee in
Canada now ever since the the dollar it
slid with the price of oil anyway I
digress so what that's equivalent to is
approximately four dollars four dollars
I mean real dollars not Canadian dollars
four dollars making it the cheapest
smartphone in the world and it goes on
sale I believe yesterday looks like it
was a yesterday at 6 a.m. now there are
some issues with the way they're
bringing it to market you have to
reserve it online which if you're gonna
kind of go okay this is the device
that's gonna like connect the Indian
people who have no devices and no
connectivity then they may not have an
internet connection or a device to do
that but maybe they have a buddy or
library or whatever else you know yeah
you know hopefully get that figured out
and the other issue with this launch is
that it is unclear at this time whether
this is an ongoing price or whether this
is I'm a starting price or something
yeah whether it's just a promotional
starting pricing if it is an ongoing
price obviously it's heavily subsidized
in fact let me just pull out it I think
it was an Indian Express com had a
really good article about it as well
here let me just let me just pull this
up this site is significantly less
obnoxious but let's see if they have any
dating advice
apparently they really the government
has
given I've been giving them immense
support through the make in India
program mm-hmm
however this is what's weird because
there's actually a sticker that is
covering up that it is actually an ad
comm icon for which is significantly
more expensive so it's just got a
sticker on the rear panel to conceal
that branding so that's not even an
Indian made device well so I don't
really maybe the sticker get that yeah
by the phone and call it a component and
they put the sticker on it and I get
boom it's made yeah
so let's talk let's talk specs so to be
clear that other device I think costs
about the equivalent of something like
forty or fifty dollars so that's closer
to what it actually cost to make a
device like this I saw an estimate that
it costs about $40 to manufacture this
thing so the issue if this is just an
introductory price is it sets a really
unrealistic expectation for smartphone
pricing because we are we are so far
away from $4 being achievable for a
device that's running android 5.1
lollipop a four inch qHD IPS display Wow
yeah is that even right I'm a little bit
worried about whether that qHD IPS
display spec is right all the other ones
are like wow that's impressive that
one's kind of you might be HD it's got
to be it's got to be HD and I I would be
surprised if it's actually I pass do you
want to investigate that yeah okay
anyway it's got a 1.3 get your heads
quad core I gig of ram 8 gigs of storage
expandable storage by up to 32 gigs and
a 3.2 megapixel rear camera 1450 million
power battery 3G support dual SIM
support and a one-year warranty 4 inch
IPS display resolution unspecified there
you go alright so that's more like it so
wait did you know the name of that phone
that they're just restoring I can look
that up ah yeah but they I mean you
never know they may have actually made
some changes like it's possible that
they reused tooling but then oh so I
remember this is there's a lot of
corners you have
to cut to sell a smartphone for college
okay so it's like it's like a bunch of
casings
we're like a bad batch or something and
they were like do you we don't know what
to do with these whoa whoa don't throw
those in the garbage we'll put our phone
in it that I don't actually be a thing I
think that's entirely impossible No so
the other sort of- take away if this is
not ongoing pricing is that it actually
does nothing to revolutionize the
connectivity of India and the Indian
people as a country and as a the people
in that country mom especially because
like if it gets out that it's not a
permanent price a whole bunch of people
just gonna buy it and flip it yep and
then you end up with it costing and it's
and that's one of those things that
frustrates me it's like I don't mind
stuff being expensive actually like I
don't I don't mind charging a fair price
for a good product i if you have a good
product that is worth X amount I would
liked I would rather see the
manufacturer take that margin that they
earned by designing and bringing this
good product to market I'd rather the
manufacturer take it then some jerk on
eBay yo yeah so I didn't get where I was
going with it yeah yeah Wow it's kind of
like the it doesn't work this way but
how annoyingly frustrating it is to have
to purchase scalped tickets yep or
brand-new game consoles yeah like
PlayStation fours and to a lesser degree
Xbox ones back when they launched oh
yeah for sure when something is in
severe demand and people just grab it
flip it it's really annoying
it's not even as easy to get anymore
yeah it's way more expensive which is
dumb and it's actually really difficult
and hard to get which is dumb
yep and we're just we're lining the
pockets of jerks on eBay there are
couriers um who else I mean there's
depending on where you buy from and who
you sell to there's potential double
taxation involved in something like this
because you know these people aren't set
up
like resellers they're not gonna write
off that PlayStation that they bought at
Best Buy as a you know taxable like
business expense and then like collect
tax from the buyer and submit all that
no one's gonna do that so they're just
kind of kind of go okay yeah I had to
pay 10% tax on it so now it's four
hundred and forty plus whatever markup
I'd like we're just we're just giving it
away so tell me something would you be
okay with surge pricing at launch
would you rather - would you rather the
manufacturer have it to that degree oh
wow that's a disgusting old to go down
no the reason why I say that is almost
everything that I buy doesn't sell out
and don't have to buy it online scalped
okay so if we just start doing surge
pricing at launch they're just gonna be
like oh well ten people bought it time
to engage third price mode okay so hold
on a second then I mean is there a
difference between surge pricing and
just the early adopter tax early
adopters yes like what if the what if
the surge pricing that I'm talking about
was not necessarily like oh you know the
factory is a little behind let's let's
hike up the price what if it was only at
the beginning what if they were like
okay for the first 10 days the Xbox two
or whatever they call whatever the next
one's gonna be the Xbox two costs $600
after that it will be $400 so if they
actually had a tiered launch so if you
it knowing full well that you can buy
one for $200 less in like let's say some
finite and a reasonable amount of time
would you be okay with them just with
just bending over the people who must
have it on launch day I wouldn't care it
would just wait but but are you okay
with the concept I think it's dirty
marketing
is it marketing to like jack up the
price temporary look is like you make a
premier crowd like maybe you make it so
that because people aren't just gonna
just have that so like halo as a launch
title it's gonna have like this 10-day
event right at the beginning which is
only during the high price time and like
you can get some special skins do you
play during the 10-day event I think we
just single-handedly solved the console
scalping problem if anyone from Xbox or
Playstation watches this stream how much
you want to bet there's gonna be okay
okay this doesn't solve the problem it
literally makes it worse no no no it
solves the problem for them not for
anyone else so you think oh well hold on
hold on okay so let me let me recap this
cuz I think I think I jumped I think I I
lost your train of thought here I think
I'm back on it so what you're saying is
if normally a console is $400 at launch
and we go okay there's a two-week event
where it's $600 you think instead of
themI baying for $800 they're gonna eBay
for $1,200 so you think we've just we've
single-handedly worse twitch chats like
dammit let it stop give me that's okay I
don't think anyone from Microsoft's Xbox
division or did PlayStation break off
from Sony no do I have to call it please
official I don't know I'll just say Xbox
and PlayStation I don't think anyone is
actually watching this but like what if
oh man oh how do okay so how do we how
do we make it more expensive without
making it enticing because that wait no
because no because that waits your own
people don't want it that bad but no no
company is gonna be like alright let's
make let's make our product less
enticing let's hike the price make it
worse let's try no one buys Microsoft
was trying very hard to do that with the
Kinect okay
less enticing in customers more so maybe
we're not giving them ideas after all
all of this already ok here it's someone
in twitch chat this is pretty good idea
no games
it is like everyone's favorite game when
you look on some system settings or work
could be all only early access games so
the people that we're screwing over are
the people who deserve it the most the
people who pre-order everything oh my
god that should be the new launch titles
for consoles yeah oh so they don't call
it the launch they call it early access
so you actually pay more to get an early
access console yeah that is literally
like they could even call it like like
like like like Xbox like 1.9 slightly
flawed yeah but then you know those will
be worth more so that's like having a
coin that's got a head on both sides
like everyone's gonna want the flawed
one even like a dead flawed one will
probably be worth as you could put the
innards of a working one in it so let's
take in same console pricing you should
oh hold on hold on yeah you know what I
guess that leaves us pretty well in
sparse okay they do this overlay thing
where you can see like the buttons in
the top corner and the bar and the
bottom bar and the middle thing saying
you should or whatever yeah I have a
serious feeling that's gonna become a
meme she's just gonna be like some like
random image in the background and then
that you should thing over top of it oh
I think that's already happening for
sure
so speaking of you should
squarespace.com looking to build a
website then good you squarespace.com

beautiful I'm next up we've got
lynda.com which I actually finally
started like actually not just like
playing around with it to validate okay
these guys are like real and they're not
just a total scam or anything I am
starting on some networking stuff
because I am a networking noob and
Johnny the network guy let me down
pretty hardcore this week released it
because I specifically asked him this I
was like okay I'm doing a point-to-point
guide so you can have ten gigabit NICs
link directly between the computers and
they both have LAN connections with a
separate NIC like tell me the guidelines
because I knew I knew there were
guidelines I was like telling me the
guidelines for what IP addresses I can
use and use public and he used public
ones he was like yeah it's fine and you
know what realistically it's probably
fine unless I happened to want to access
that particular HP it turns out it was
HP reserved ip's unless I wanted to
access that particular HP site it wasn't
like hewlett-packard calm it was like
who knows yeah it would have been fine I
would have literally never run into that
but I believe in
best practices and I asked him not once
but three times are you sure he's like
yeah it's fine I'm like are you sure
he's like yeah it's fine so half the
comments on that video are Linus you
need to get a new network guy for Johnny
that's okay Johnny's done he's mostly
pretty good anyway the point is I
started on the basics I have to say for
me it was a little frustrating how basic
the like the very basic like beginner
course was but I was like okay no I'm
gonna I'm gonna power through this is
some weird term or whatever yep yep
their work I have I have a better
understanding of a ring topology network
than they did before as irrelevant as
that is in the modern age yeah but it's
okay it's okay they you know they're
they're laying the groundwork so I'm
working on that and anyway so lynda.com

alright so let's move into our next
topic here this was posted by giving TNT
on the forum this is the reflex the
revolutionary full-color high-definition
bendable smartphone that you won't have
your hands on anytime in the next five
years very cool technology it actually
includes not just a bendable display and
obviously internal components of some
sort not just a bendable display but
also haptic feedback so what the example
they're showing right there is bending
the display to flip the page in some
kind of a graphic novel or comic and it
actually gives you haptic feedback
that's like the clip you're you're
flipping the page isn't that cool when
you're playing Angry Birds for example
what it can do is it can have like a
very tactile sort of experience with the
stretching back of the rubber band and
then the home releasing it yeah pretty
cool I've actually got an Angry Birds
our Kade game at the castle fun park out
in abbotsford now it was new the last
time I went there so I think it's I
think it's probably pretty new it's it's
actually pretty clever so it's just
Angry Birds on a giant touchscreen
display at the end of like a long tube
it's probably about the size of like the
small like basketball thank you and then
it's got a lawn chair
which I wish was a was like a slingshot
but it's not it's just a pinball pulley
thing well it's okay because you at
least have a thing you can hold and kind
of and it's just got a little inflatable
ball inside that you fling and it's a
touchscreen so it knows where it hit
something text the hip and it knocks
down the crap that's cool okay I guess
that's worth $1 20 a play are you for
real castle phone park yeah the good
news is that my kids are young so they
don't actually realize half the time
that the games not on so like we go
there with four people we kill like an
hour and a half two hours we spend like
20 bucks and like the pool tables there
are really crappy so no one's ever
really on them so we go and like when we
get bored of the other stuff we we load
up we it's like a buck 20 to get all the
balls we put them in the middle of the
table and then the kids just like using
the sticks or my daughter actually just
gets up on the pool table and just puts
them in puts them in the pockets and
then my wife and I just walk around and
like grab them before they go down yeah
back on as long as no one's waiting no
one's ever really yelled at us you just
got like a a one-year-old like crawling
around on top of the food they don't
really care again as long as no one's
waiting
they're pretty chill and we're there
we're spending money I mean there's like
two employees working for minimum wage
and no one else there ever so yeah I I
finally got my son to go in the ones
last time you went there pretty okay so
did you see that like I'll break the
lasers or dodged the lasers room so
every time we've gone they're just like
three or four times now I've been like
do you want to go in there he's kind of
just kind of a shy kid anyways so the
last time I was like you guys just
because I I thought he would like it
right okay we should give context it
brings you into a room that's all like
matte black on the inside and there's
random lasers shooting in a bunch of
different directions and you have to
work your way through the room without
tripping the lasers there's two
different games you can play I'm going
to describe this one first without
breaking the lasers and then hold your
hand on a panel and then someone else
has to do the same thing and they have
to hold their hand on the panel they
have to work your way all the way back
or they just have lasers going all over
the place and you have to run through
and crossed them all as fast as you can
and it's timed and it's time um so
anyway I asked him if you wanted to do
that one because I figured for a
three-year-old they just break all the
lasers is probably gonna be the easiest
thing if you goes no no I want to do the
other one I go oh okay
so what I didn't realize is that a
two-player mode costs exactly twice as
much and B once we went inside if you
play two player mode dodging around the
lasers and holding your hands on the
like they look like hand print scanner
things like it's kind of noisy yeah you
have to split up yeah
so we're in this dark room that he never
really wanted to go into in the first
place finally gave in to me about and
I'm like go over there don't touch the
beams okay hold your hands on there and
he's just like so I'd the game it only
lasts like a minute the game turns off
he's like dad I want to go outside now
I'm like yep we're never going in here
again this is his Space Mountain my
daddy on Space Mountain when I was like
six never forgave him still remember to
this day I didn't ride a roller coaster
for a decade I'm dead serious like I
didn't enjoy rollercoasters until I was
in like my early 20s whoa yeah like like
that was that was one of my scarred for
life experiences as a kid was riding
Space Mountain when I was a really
little kid so if you guys are thinking
you know you want it you want to pull
one over on your kids and and give them
an experience to remember when they're
really young then Space Mountain I want
to go back and you said you won oh you
said I want to go back and do the ninja
one but with tighter clothes I was
wearing a baggy shirt so I try to like
arm over something in the shirt which is
crosses we should do the ninja one
because quite frankly I had a terrible
teammate last time you down I'd be down
I'm kind of big that's okay to Troy
dodge lasers but I'll wear tight or
closer I'm super down I'm down for
anything that involves you wearing
tighter clothes do we have to invite the
ladies on this double date probably
should all right this was posted by the
point-blank on the forum original
article here's from Anne
police the cat s60 is the first phone
with an ethyl ir thermal camera built-in
now this isn't the first cat phone
although the first one I kind of looked
and went ok so it's a recognized phone
with very medaling specs it's very
expensive I'm not that interested in
this moving on this one has got my
attention this is very cool same thing
somewhat middling specs I think they
quote octo-core snapdragon which oh no
no actually they say it's a it is a
Snapdragon 617 so again not
top-of-the-line but certainly capable
4.7 inch HD capacitive multi-touch so
that's only 720p but it does have auto
wet finger and glove support it is drop
proof to 1.8 meters which is pretty darn
impressive that's about 5 feet for the
Yanks out there has a strengthened
diecast frame optimized battery
performance so 3,800 milliamp hour
battery
combine that with the 720p screen and
these dragon 617 that thing is going to
haul when it comes to battery life and
it's got 32 gigs of store
32 gigs of storage three gigs of RAM
runs Android marshmallow coming later on
super bright display typical 514 it's
not too shabby Gorilla Glass 4 but it is
all about that thermal camera so check
out this picture this is back on Android
police here this is the first dual
camera implementation that I've seen
that makes any sense
yeah the One m8 was just stupid like oh
we have a depth camera so that you can
do this stupid gimmick that looks
terrible and is bad this is cool so it
combines the thermal camera with the
regular camera to give you real image
clarity with the thermal information
overlaid how freakin handy would that be
for a contractor you want to know which
pipes got the hot water in it but brow
that's actually really want to know if
some wires in the wall are heating up
before very very cool and I can see this
being useful for all kinds of stuff like
even for me like is something in that
system overheating
Wow we're gonna get tired of that bow
bow thing eventually you should know I'm
never gonna get tired of you should know
so like home for the new catchphrase we
find some way to make everything yep
it's like heaven forbid they came up
with something with like swear words in
it like Squarespace yeah I'll be the
best company motto ever everyone would
know about it would be in the news
everywhere yes and though it seems like
people get over it like that audio
like no one really no one really
flinches anymore that's true but like
they did put the like fcuk that's not
edgy anymore yeah it's true clothing
brand yeah yeah people just get and
people will become immune to anything
that's true yeah wouldn't become pretty
numb to like that's the word I was
looking for numb this was supposed to
buy yummy chicken blue on the forum the
original article here is from Forbes
Apple finally addresses the error 53
issue that causes people who replace
their home button and then upgrade their
OS to not be able to use their phone it
just would brick so apples former stance
on this was will you had your handset
repaired by an unauthorized technician
so I guess we'll just break your phone
because you're a jerk and we hate you
yeah so apparently error 53 was supposed
to be a factory test that was not
intended to affect customers and all it
would just say was the iPhone could not
be updated an unknown error occurred
fortunately they finally issued a patch
so it's billed number 13 D 20 in the
most current mobile operating system iOS
nine point two point one that will allow
people dealing with the air 53 issue to
plug into iTunes and update so yay so
it'll restore bricked iPhones some
repair dude who has like 50 air 53
bricked iPhones sitting on a shelf
somewhere it's just like so stoked
however the patched version of nine
point two point one will not permit
touch ID to start working again unless
it has been verified by an official
Apple technician so you'll have to take
it to an Apple repair center to verify
that it is properly secured the official
stance here is that there are shady
technicians out there that could allow
malicious access to your data otherwise
I mean that is maybe not a bad point
there are some pretty skilled folks out
there who could solder some pretty cool
grabbing things while they're in flight
stuff and put that into a phone I
suppose
so as long as they are willing to allow
me to repair it myself and at least just
like give it the OL hey you did it okay
then I'm alright with that it is unclear
how much Apple is going to be charging
however for this verification I don't
know that doesn't mean no one knows but
I certainly don't know speaking of
things that I don't know I don't know
how the crap this works allo Fox posted
this on the forum original article
here's from the verge five dimensional
glass discs can store data for up to
13.8 billion years so we have officially
preserved the King James Version of the
Holy Bible for people 13.8 billion years
from now and that is if it will work
apparently even up to nearly 200 degrees
Celsius so to put this in the
appropriate context a standard sized
disk so that same blu-ray that is now
capable of holding 128 gigs of data
would be able to hold 360 terabytes of
data safely within glass it's using and
I am NOT a physicist here but it's using
something to do with nano gratings that
change how light is reflected and
encodes the data in five dimensions and
that's why they can store data so
densely compared to traditional optical
discs scientists believe this could be
commercialized in the
- distant future another big deal this
week this was supposed to buy spaghetti
carbonara on the forum is that Twitter
channel banning is apparently real and
happening every day says an inside
source now I don't know how much of this
is tinfoil hat wearing I didn't have
time to look into this report myself so
we just have to trust Colton to have
done it correctly sandwich that whole
five D thing literally in the article it
says that the location in space is on
the x y&amp;amp;z axis so it's not five beans
unless it's like a location and ur
trajectory and something else
but it's not moving so
I hate when people do that anyways
moving on some Twitter shadow banning
thing uh yeah so there were rumors that
Twitter had begun shadow banning
politically inconvenient users that has
been confirmed allegedly by a source
inside the company according to the
source which I don't know if we can
believe because whenever its source
we're calling this rumor Twitter
maintains a whitelist and a blacklist
the whitelist is people who are of
Caucasian descent and the black look no
I'm just kidding
it's the the more the mark you didn't
even catch that did you know I said the
white list was Caucasians it's just a
joke the white list is apparently users
who are are okay to broadcast their
tweets all over the place on the black
list is apparently users that are being
somewhat or fully shadow banned so
instead of just banning the user
directly their content is hidden from
the public view so this is a pretty
common practice on things like online
communities in fact we're gonna be
working on a shadow banning feature on
the Linus tech tips form the way that
we're planning to use it is very very
different from this however so what
they're effectively doing is hiding
these blacklisted users content from the
public view so Twitter users have
allegedly the rumor been reporting
tweets from popular conservatives
members of alternative rights cultural
libertarians and anti PC dissidents that
have been disappearing from their
timelines yeah so kind of a big deal I
mean I saw someone's comment in the
thread that was like oh whatever no big
deal it's just Twitter I mean it's like
this private company they can do
whatever they want but when you're as
big as Twitter when you have as much
influence on the world and the way
people perceive it you have kind of a
responsibility yeah um I mean back to
how we plan to use shadow banning
features the way that we had discussed
it was giving people time outs from each
other if there are users that cannot get
along and are starting flame wars with
each other all the time we might start
implementing shadow bans
between those users so they just
straight-up can't talk to each other and
we would tell people that we're doing it
we're like look we're giving you a
timeout you're done you're not talking
to each other anymore unless you create
duplicate accounts which by the way is
against the Terms of Service then we'll
get both of your account permanently
permanently nuclearized
and we'll burn them both yep so so
basically like there are valid reasons
if you have a platform that you have to
moderate like something that people
don't necessarily realize is that
community sites are at least partially
responsible for the content that's on
them we can't post Google ads on -
tek-tips comm anymore because of some
questionable material that was posted by
members bunch of people posted anime
porn thank you for that so ultimately we
have to moderate this site and if we're
having problems then shadow banning can
be in a very effective way to get rid of
it but I think you have to maintain a
certain level of transparency and you
have to maintain your integrity as well
you can't just start you know shadow
banning people you don't agree with I
mean if that were the case I actually
posted this right in the thread I was
like my response to you misanthrope is
proof that we don't believe him
censoring people that we regularly
disagree with because I do believe that
line is tek-tips calm aside from you
know being excellent to each other and
abiding by the Terms of Service
I believe it should be an a place for
open discussion and we allow any
criticism I mean the only criticism of
the only personal attacks we don't allow
are from members to members you can go
after an admin in any way you want I
would way rather you publicly attacked
me yeah and you publicly attacked some
other user on the site yeah so our users
and our moderators because they are they
are volunteers you guys okay they're
nice people our users and our moderators
are off-limits but if there's something
you don't like you can let me or Luke
have what for about it if that's what
what's your vote I also want to cover
this real quick if there's a moderator
that does something that you don't like
we're not a fan of you trying to spit
roast them in front of everyone on the
site because again they're volunteers
and they're
there's just wanna help everyone and
it's really kind of shitty when you're
trying to help everyone and you get
publicly roasted yeah
so the end about it and we can talk
about what happened and you shouldn't
you should you should message me right
and there's uh there's been a lot of
stuff there's some times where I'll be
like yeah I know you're wrong
sorry fine and then there's also times
where it's permanently buy I've seen
that happen you're wrong and honestly
your punishment wasn't severe enough
happened
it has also happened where I went okay
maybe they were having a bad day let's
make this a little bit easier so yeah
anyways so that's pretty much it for the
wine show today thanks for watching
thanks to death guy 91 for the pizza
today and we will see you again next
week
same bat-time same bat-channel
why oh my goodness the YouTube announced
the video announcing this true
but this is one of the weeks I actually
remembered to pull it down
we
I don't know why
I just I hate everything sorry guys no
after-party today because I'm super
tired actually I want to fix the server
