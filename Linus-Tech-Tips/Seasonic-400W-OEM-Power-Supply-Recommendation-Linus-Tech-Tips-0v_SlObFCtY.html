cameraman to start today's episode with
a word other than so so that was my
attempt at it and moving on we are going
to be looking at power supplies today I
get a lot of personal messages on
YouTube asking me for especially power
supply recommendations because everyone
can look up benchmarks for a video card
or a CPU and everyone can look up a
price that's easy okay I need this much
performance I want to pay this much easy
done
however for power supply it starts to
get a little bit more complicated
because there's so much misinformation
out there about what kind of a power
supply you need like for example you'll
see you'll see specs on a CPU like 140
watts well that's a TDP that's not
actually the wattage that that CPU
consumes from a power supply so there's
there's and then you've got a video card
that might output you know a 150 watt
heat load but that's what's in heat so
that's that's not useful for for this
either so basically I wanted to do a
quick recommendation video on a basic
power supply that I think is just one of
the best no frills no gimmicks power
supplies out on the market now these two
you look at them and they look pretty
similar but for power supply all of the
important stuff is what goes on under
the plain metal casing so let's start
with looking at what I would call not a
very solid power supply this is what I
would consider a doorstop okay so
there's no particular markings you can
find you can find a rated output on here
so 18 amps total on the 12 volt rail is
not very strong by today's standards the
12 volt rail is very important so that's
part of what makes it a budget cheapo
power supply okay you can see that it
doesn't have this is one that I use for
testing fans actually but the actual
stock connectors on it are very few it
doesn't even have a PCI Express
connector because honestly if you have a
dedicated video card you shouldn't be
using a doorstop power supply it also
uses an 80 millimeter fan for cooling
which means it's not going to be as
quiet as a quality power supply and it
not going to run as cool so that brings
us into what I believe is one of the
best value power supplies on the market
this is the CE Sonic SS 400 et it is a
400 watt power supply and unless you're
looking at a very basic system 400 watts
is pretty much where I would start now
yes you can probably power you know
integrated video AMD quad core with you
know a hard drive all your standard
stuff off a 250 or even 300 watt power
supply no problem but a 400 watt power
supply is going to be built a little bit
better you're going to get 80 plus
bronze certification and you also get
expandability for the future that is a
big thing that I always stress when
people ask me for a power supply
recommendation is that it's not always
about what you're hooking up to it today
it's more about what you may need to
hook up to it in the future so you can
see this one it doesn't have all the
bells and whistles that you'll find on
the higher end models but what it does
have is a 24-pin connector for the for
the motherboard it has either an 8 pin
or a 4 pin connector so you can see on a
cheaper unit you might only find a four
pin p4 connector okay so that gives you
the proper connectors you need for a
modern motherboard it's got proper SATA
connectors so you got 4 SATA connectors
which means you can actually add more
hard drives to your system whereas a
really basic unit might only have one or
two SATA connectors on it I mean yeah
you can use adapters but then you're
just adding more cable clutter and more
in efficiencies to it and then you've
also got an adequate number of molex
connectors as well as one PCI Express
connector so really the 350 watt 400
watt range is where you start getting
into power supplies that can genuinely
power a dedicated graphics card and a
400 watt unit like this with great
efficiency is going to be good for even
up to like a mid-range video card like a
57 70 so this gets my recommendation
gold star also yeah here's another thing
to look at you can see that when you
start to look at a quality built power
supply you find dual 12-volt rails
capable of providing up to 360 watts
combined
so those 12-volt rails are almost
capable of providing the full power of
this power supply that's how you can
tell it's a modernly designed well built
unit because most modern systems are
going to rely very heavily on that
twelve volt rail you also get silence
see sonic is really known for their
quiet power supplies and you can see
that even on their low-end models they
equip them with 120-millimeter fans as
well as 80 plus 80 plus goes a long way
towards making sure that this fan is not
spinning really hard to get rid of
excess heat from inefficiency you got a
nice efficient unit running a nice quiet
120mm fan that's how you're going to
make sure you have a good power supply
experience on the back you've just got a
standard honeycomb grille so that's
where the exhaust air is going to come
out from that 120mm fan and then you've
got your standard power input as well as
an on/off switch this is very convenient
that's another thing again you may not
find on a low end power supply in order
to completely cut the power off from
your system with this unit you have to
pull the power cord it's just not
convenient like I know you don't have to
turn off the system manually at the back
very often but if you ever do it's nice
to have the switch just those little
things are what makes buying a decent
quality power supply very very important
it also just doesn't cost that much more
and it's going to give you better
reliability overall for your computer
because the power supply is often one of
the first things to fail so if you buy a
good quality power supply and a good
quality motherboard that's the other big
one then you can be sure your system is
going to last for a long time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
