computer case so epic that it had to be
delivered on a pallet rather than via
normal means so of course we brought
with us the only tool suitable to open
such a thing chopsticks
the gtx 980ti VR edition from EVGA
provides an industry-leading graphics
experience as well as a five and a
quarter inch bay with easy access inputs
for your VR device
learn more at the link in the video
description ok well that was obviously
completely stupid let's go with the more
traditional knife to open this baby up
so inside this box is actually more than
just a computer case in fact there's a
case a power supply and a motherboard
yes my friends this is the first time
we've ever had a chance to check out one
of Super micros bare-bones
server units that they sell but this one
is very special one that I wish I'd
known about a month ago when I was
trying to do the seven gamers one CPU
project and the only way that I could
figure out to put seven graphics cards
into a single computer was to water cool
the whole bloody thing with all this
like custom nonsense and I had to find
the one motherboard on earth that would
work etc etc it's such a know my friends
there was an easy way to do it all along
all I had to do was get one of these bad
boys
oh cool they actually like pre modded it
for me so let's let's pull this out
let's pull this up check this out tears
oh oh yes my friends yes my friends that
is exactly what it looks like the entire
rear of a 4u chassis taken up entirely
by expansion slot alright my friends so
let's take a quick tour of this absolute
beast
Auto monster this is I'm gonna read it
off in the Super Micro 40 27 gr - TR
which axle which actually isn't the
right thing they told me they were
sending the TRT the one
the ten gigabit network interface
built-in maybe they included like an
upgrade module or something so first of
all this is cool it includes four 1600
watt power supplies yes friends that is
for all kinds of crazy power delivery
along with redundancy which is important
in any kind of a server environment you
can see there these tiny slim little
units here let's see if we can read this
baby yeah this is the DPS 1600 CB so the
output is actually 1600 watts max if oh
this is interesting
I have never seen a discrepancy like
that before
so at 120 volt input it's a thousand
watts max and at 240 volt input it is
1600 watts max very very interesting so
I'm going to have to make sure I run
this baby on 240 volt input but in the
meantime let's see if Super Micro
included like an upgrade module kit or
something like that these are our rails
these are those really nice rails that I
like so we're going to go ahead and rail
mount this baby in the rack and then in
here I'm hoping to find well nothing
apparently
ah okay ah
okay well let's open it up then I guess
oh but first no a tour of the front so
there's more to this there are more
tricks up this baby's sleeves than just
a bunch of video cards so this server
will actually be taking the place of two
servers because in addition to accepting
up to eight dual slot video cards it can
also handle with these two and a half
inch sleds 24 SSDs so this will be
completely taking over Wanek servers
duties in addition to being the new
output render station that we never
actual
properly finished because we were trying
to combine that one's duties with our in
gestation and that ended up causing
instability issues due to different
versions of Adobe Premiere from
different years operating at the same
time a long story anyway it was kind of
ugly and we are looking for a better way
to do this so tooless top it looks like
let's find out if we can get this baby
off oh don't we need to unscrew some
things so it's only it's only pretends
to be coolest check out this
modification that spoiler is actually
there for a reason and I will explain it
in a little while here Oh oh yes that
that is fun so here let's try and just
try and sort these babies out a little
bit see what we got
see what we got going on here so this
motherboard supports two LGA 2011 three
CPUs so we're going to be putting our
two eighteen core $26.99 v3 s in here
for a total of 36 cores and on top of
that it supports a total of twelve DIMM
slots you can see they were testing it
they had it looks like sixteen dims in
here before they sent it to me so twelve
DIMM slots per CPU for a total of twenty
four dimm slots that means with the 32
gig dims that kingston sent us for seven
gamers one cpu we could put 32 times 24
whatever that works out to inside here
this is another really cool feature that
I wish would make its way to the desktop
check out these fans these are not these
are not the counter spinning fan so
these are just regular old 92 millimeter
fans except for one thing do you notice
that I just pulled it out where was the
connector servers have had this forever
hot swap fan so you just thunk them in
and boom look at this you've got little
slots all over the place here for all
these different fan connectors check
this out
and you can see they've actually got two
stacks of them one in front of the other
in order to give these puppies pretty
much unlimited
static pressures so they're pulling all
that ventilation in from these holes in
the front group hold on
Oh try not to drop this from these holes
in the front here as well as through
where those SSD mounts go so they've got
to have a ton of static pressure because
these puppies are not just you know
cooling some run-of-the-mill computer
we're talking 36 processing cores a
bunch of RAM and up to yes this is where
life gets really interesting up to 8
graphics cards one two three four one
two three four each of which can be dual
slot and then in addition to that it can
handle another three expansion cards of
whatever type you desire so I actually
guess nothing would prevent you from
putting ten in here if you really really
wanted to which is which is sort of sort
of bananas so let's go ahead and see
what it'll look like
with all those installed okay you want
to come with me while I go retrieve
graphics cards all right so let's pick
some video cards shall we let's go with
what do we got here I don't know some
kind of 290 or 390 or something all
right we got here
whoo a GTX 580 sure thing no problem
what else we got gtx 980 yeah take one
of those and no gtx 780 Ti that sounds
pretty good we got a good good
representation of the market share of
these two graphics card companies I take
these back and hidden still don't trip
one really cool thing I want to point
out before we get any further in though
is that most of what you see up here is
actually just like like a like a dummy
board like this is like a daughter board
it's not there's not a ton of logic on
it actually it installs into the
motherboard which is below see down here
using it looks like for hard PCB bridges
down here and then that's what does all
the controlling so it's actually all
mapped out for you so here's CPU one
your CPU
- and then all of these are labeled
right here so this is CPU one slot one
pcie 3.0 16x CP 1 slot 10 okay well the
numbering doesn't make a ton of sense to
me so far but it goes one ten nine eight
seven six five anyway so it says CPU one
CPU two and it's all kind of spelled out
for you like that so let's start
installing video cards and D and NVIDIA
living together and perfect harmony I
don't know how that song goes but I
think you guys get the realize I don't
even know if I'm gonna be able to find
enough video cards to fill this thing up
it's ridiculous okay so before we put
any more in I want to take a short break
and give you guys a better appreciation
of the scale of what we're dealing with
here this is a normal ATX motherboard it
can fit for graphics cards total if you
include one here and if you install one
in the very bottom slot and have it
overhang the bottom of the board so look
a little something like that this is
what we're dealing with here it's
ridiculous so let's keep the ridiculous
mess up let's put some more graphics
cards in let's put one here wow that's a
long card but it fits just fine let's
put one here let's put one here Oh balls
this is a stupid modified one from
scrapyard Wars that I'll just move it
see it's not a standard width but that's
okay there are so many different spots
for graphics cards server stuff all
about that convenience no PCI Express
locks you want to pull a card out boom
you pull it out no big deal
right yeah okay Linus but what about
that thing you promised us before you
said you'd explain why this thing is
that fricking humpback whale now just
because we can install you know 69 90s
like crazy long cards like this doesn't
mean that you can install anything you
want in a system like this and we are
somewhat limited in terms of the high
of our graphics cards because one of the
use so you is your vertical vertical
measurement of height for a system like
this one of the use is taken up by all
those power supplies here at the back
with only three left for graphics cards
that means any cards that are taller
than standard are not going to fit
within that 4u enclosure size what that
also means is that any cards that are
designed with their power plugs coming
out of the top of the card like this
would interfere with a flat top panel
which is why we got this modified pump
back one there we go that is going to
take up a little bit of space above our
servers so let's go ahead and make sure
that that actually fits okay yes that
fits perfectly with all of our graphics
cards love it so we've got big plans for
this thing we're going to be doing a
video where we explore who makes the
best GPU for video encoding and premiere
so we're going to do like an AMD vs.
Nvidia head-to-head and show a bunch of
different classes of GPU find out if you
even need a super powerful one we're
going to be doing one where we have
eight game streams running off of a
single machine at a time that is going
to be flipping SiC and finally we are
going to be maybe actually you guys let
me know if you want to see this but
maybe doing a showcase of the final
build that I do in here with the 24 SSDs
maybe they'll be like a follow up holy
episode rather than a normal release
with all the SSDs as well as all the
graphics cards that we ended up putting
into it and on that subject I fix it
calm you're complete DIY electronics
repair solution from there 19,000 free
step-by-step repair guides to their huge
inventory of replacement parts and tools
iFixit has got your repair needs covered
they've got all kinds of great stuff I
use all their stuff all the time I
actually do people are always like Linus
I fix-it product policeman oil right
there no actually I was I was just using
it today's highlight is they're all new
completely reimagined pro tech tool kit
it now includes their new 64-bit driver
kit which replaced the former 54 bit
driver kit meaning fewer road blocks if
you don't have the
a bit it's held in with magnets now the
casing is more durable they've actually
got some new prying tools and all the
things that we have come to expect in
the old protec toolkit that are super
handy whether it's metal spudger or an
ESD safety strap it's all in there and
the best part is it's backed by I fix
its lifetime warranty but wait there's
more there's a new best part if you guys
