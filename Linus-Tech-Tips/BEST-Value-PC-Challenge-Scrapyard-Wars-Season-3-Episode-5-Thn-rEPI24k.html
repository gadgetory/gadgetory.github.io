brought to you by D brand
okay so we're back from free geek we got
a whole bunch of our parts we've got a
sense of my 775 motherboard eight gigs
of ram a QC 600 160 gigabyte hard drive
and a 550 watt BFG tech power supply
everything here I've tested except for
the power supply in the graphics card so
hopefully that all works out right now
what I'm trying to set up to you is hook
all this stuff up in this corner and we
try to get a monitor and keyboard a
mouse over here too and then I'm gonna
have my other desk where I'm doing my
woodworking stuff right here so that
while this is running like Windows
updates and junk I can hopefully work on
that so that once this is kind of done
doing Windows updates and junk I can
mount it on to the wooden board and then
hoping tomorrow that I can more focus on
overclocking and stuff all day because I
really want to get that down I think I
can overclock this card a bit I think I
can overclock that CPU a bit so I want
to take advantage of that extra
performance so the one she think about
not having the screws here is worth the
twenty bucks for sure but is that I
can't screw in my DVI cable so it just
goes to there because normally there's a
screw in there that I would screw into
so that's fine if I really wanted to I
could use DisplayPort or HDMI but I'm
just gonna use DVI for now because it's
the cable that I have but I'm going to
try to find screws to put in here just
because it would be good form not
because actually we needed I guess here
goes nothing I was trying to document
the issue with this graphics card but
since we changed to my test bench power
supply it's actually fine now which is
pretty bad news because what that means
is that our ghetto power supply works
fine with a card but it's not plugged
directly into but then doesn't work with
a card that result requires artillery
power which means our 7970 might not run
off this power supply even if it is
ready to have enough wattage it might
just be too crappy
I'm muted damn it Terry how long have I
been muted um have I been needed since I
like went to the bathroom a billion
years ago now because I've actually got
some time to spend with my CPU the rules
for overclocking are that you can have
an overclock but as soon as you run into
stability issues during the testing
phase you have to turn off your
overclock and run again you don't get to
like try and dial it in a little bit
lower so it's working I guess this is
good news in that it's a working
graphics card and that the power supply
is powering it but bad news and that I'm
not getting my 20 bucks back if I want
to know if it'll work with a 7970 if I
want to know if I need another power
supply what I could do is grab a 7970
and test it nope we do not have one ok
so that throws a bit of a monkey wrench
into my plan that's ok though we'll just
find another graphics card that draws a
similar amount of power and go from
there we may end up using this card
after all oh wow inaccessible boot
device oh wow what's going on here this
computer is not happy now that we've
installed a power-hungry card there are
a lot of power supplies on Craigslist
nothing that cheap Corsair CX 500 would
do the trick yeah this is this is not
this is not booting this is really bad
and there's Ubuntu so the gaffer's card
works the power supply works everything
else I already tested works nice
oh okay on this station here I'm going
to focus on formatting into Windows I
need to get bun to off of here get into
Windows on this Drive and then over here
I'm going to keep working on my little
woodworking project trying to get this
going using these sample pieces the
sample power supply half and sample
motherboard that I have to kind of work
on the layout of how everything is going
to actually be on here one other thing
that I need to do is actually use this
screw bin and possibly use another few
things around the office to try to rig
up the back of that graph as cars it
actually has screws on it although that
isn't a huge priority right now that
would be kind of nice to do scrapyard
Wars we'll be right back after these
messages this episode of scrapyard Wars
is brought to you by D brand makers of
the precision cut vinyl skins that
you'll see on the phones and notebooks
of our contestants they offer a wide
variety of styles and colors and support
for the coolest devices including the
PlayStation 4 galaxy note 5 and iPhone
6s protect the body of your devices and
make them look great at dbrand comm /
scrapyard wars so we have two terrible
power supplies throw it together
hopefully I'd equals one good power
supply this is the goods and core i7 Oh
was it 120 669 90 180 we move for that
bold of a car they had a duel an instant
this thing is a monster
no so I think it actually can only see
will it fit in the case oh all right so
that's actually not gonna fit in the
case no fear though this stuff we just
cut all this out right yeah I should
just comply even get ya this will come
out you won't take a guess on like how
much we spent on all this stuff mm-hmm
350 oh no it's like 550 okay so you
spent 30 on one stick yeah dude Ram was
tough Ram was really tough because you
have you got thinking for a ride but
still the thing was we no one had any
cheap around like you
honestly have like pretty primo stuff
it's yeah this is the only concern at
least a little work right it's like it's
brand-new exactly yeah
so that's the thing we want we have
everything yeah so we have everything
now we basically just need to make sure
it works I'm a little worried because
this needs it's like a 500 watt card
this needs to eight pins so we're gonna
have to make sure that these power
supplies this power supply has it's not
that bad so it has a six pin here and I
think it's got an eight pin so much
Sparkle power
oh this is a bunch of adapter she
doesn't have the extra - oh wait what
what is going on here why are there so
many adapters all these mullux have
adapters on them we should have looked
at this before yeah so basically power
supply right here tape it on cut this
slash try to remove it I'm not sure if
it can be unscrewed or not but we can
remove this somehow I'm not really
worried about that and just hope that
these two power supplies are not for the
core i7 and the 6990 sorry you need an
actual saver you have an actual Center
yeah I have an Action Center Oh theatre
company
I've been using it here sure so sure
yeah
I'm done with that yeah I'm done with
that
yeah I know it's the wrong thing but
it's actually kind of working actually
pretty well did my I just sand it off
the mark that I made for where I wanted
to cut I'm not saying there's chi
involved but also that's a point
deduction little suspicious right there
we we know that - was still an amended
half I was yeah oh how do you know I
asked him and he told me he's cheating
so he's absolutely I'm calling about the
CX 500 power supply I can come get it
today if you can do 20 sure why not um
honey so I could buy it yeah like if you
just give me an address I can I can get
there tonight no problem well if you
leave now you can come to my house I I
still won't be at work after that okay
I live in Richmond oh yeah okay yep son
of a bitch okay how are we gonna do this
we got to go to Vancouver we got to go
to Richmond and we got to go to
Coquitlam and we are gonna be all over
the place the next little bit here okay
so he won't set it up to show us it
works but we have another option so
we've got a twenty dollar power supply
to go with our hundred dollar graphics
card and we'll just bring a computer
with us to test it let's go
okay I think we can I think we can hit
all these places today as long as our
back-alley contact is on time I think we
got this it's three o'clock and it's 10
minutes to our next destination
you know what new plan
because back-alley guy wasn't able to
meet until four ish so we're gonna go
straight back to Coquitlam and then to
the back alley
and as long as we can get there before
5:00 if it takes us a little longer to
drive back we technically haven't broken
the rules you have to be done scrapped
yarding and head back at five Luke we're
good I think the rule is you have to be
back at 5:30 well it's all very gray
anyway my keys right there when you ex
yep
let's cook you oh you got it from NCIX I
see tell from the NCI exit sticker yeah
okay cables are inside and presumably it
works yeah pleasure doing business with
you huge fan actually oh yeah yeah
screwed okay here you go well nothing
that we know of at the moment I only
have one of those though that's okay I
can get an adapter well I mean if it
doesn't super work just let me know
cause like that yeah we didn't have time
to test our 7970 but the guy said we can
come back tomorrow morning if we need to
refund so at least we have the back-up
plan of using our 68 50 and returning
the 7970 so that's good and our quote
from Google Maps right now is that we
will arrive in the back alley at 458 he
said we can have the sound card for free
just if we just come pick it up I am
gonna have my system thank you thank you
all right we got our sound cards uh so
our back alley best friend hooked us up
with an Audigy two and a Sound Blaster
live both of which are PCI graphics
cards and at least one of which I'm
hoping will both work and have drivers
for Windows 7 which is what we've
standardized on using so as long as
that's the case I have everything I need
for my winning computer yeah so I feel
better about telling you guys stuff I'm
really Ed's been very helpful he's not
been an impartial camera me so we've
been a team here but I didn't know I was
yeah I didn't either very much not an
impartial man oh yeah you give me a
reason why escape with vanilla stuff in
life so why me variable that you thought
you know what you have one hour
okay oh so you happy this is helpful ah
smaller one okay
Oh do we need something to short the
pins on the up here okay paper clip yeah
yeah sure maybe
No we'll be in uniform
how are you salesman with that how are
you feel under without a paperclip haha
think I deal of paper Oh get that I
think it'll actually work this sounds
like we're about to die this out of the
way man I'm installing it yeah let's
build outside the case you're right
right because okay memories good I can't
get back at it it's way too tight
especially with a big knife like this
like it's a bad idea really bad idea
it's so tight
ah I know I'm scaring me with this right
now
oh no I slightly damaged some of the
sleeping uh oh that's not good yes okay
we're gonna put get we're good okay
slight problem smell the board needs an
8-pin connector and we only have a four
also bad news this also has a four pin
can we couldn't each power supply power
half the CPU - that seems like a
horrible idea either we try to see if
one 4 pin will work no no we got to do
this let's try it with one for pet let's
hopefully that will work we have a quick
time check for 50 so we have 10 minutes
do we just try it we need to still open
you still lose the paperclip thing how
is this gonna work dude okay so this is
a green your June I agree that's green
okay and the one right beside it is
black I mean I feel like you're a
suppose do this with a staple I think I
suppose do this ever but especially I
was a staple wait wait hang on oh no we
don't have a way to turn this on
I've never done that before we don't
know yes yes it works power supply power
supply fan fan yes we did it
okay we just need to make sure this is
actually like posting but all the fans
are running it looks like it's working
need some sanding but there's my
graphics card holding plate or my power
supply holding plate maybe the power
supply my computer is still setting up
over there Windows 7 Professional is
still applying my settings it's been
doing that forever it's kind of getting
annoying let's try this cool so just
like I had kind of hoped I don't
actually even need this block it'll just
hopefully look cool I hope it looks cool
I really hope it looks cool it looks
like it works but it's not posting and
we're over time this is
seems like a horrible idea horrible idea
but whatever its do it they don't wanna
go in together what are you talking
about you squish it Tori good nothing's
good enough I know no no this power
supply should be spinning right now I
don't understand what if it's not it
should be working
oh you're right I'll come on oh dude I
don't know if these are supposed to work
together I don't think that cuz you're
not supposed to put that inside one now
we get we're going from molex to 6-pin
and then William sick pin 8 pin like we
did here except this time its power to
CPU I actually never even try this I
don't think it'll work but it could I
cut it hey V I I haven't feeling this
shouldn't work if it does work it
shouldn't work look at this
what are we done no no don't worry it's
different okay
so at this point I think we have to call
it a day the fans spin the two power
supply thing actually works which is
more than I thought I could say but it
won't post and I think the problem is
powering the motherboard so we have a
one eight pin power connector for the
CPU we only have a four pin from each
power supply so neither of them are
actually enough to get it to post I'm
assuming that's the problem because when
we tried to plug in both four pins which
you're not supposed to do this power
supply freaked out and stopped working
so I'm pretty sure if we could get these
two somehow between the two to power the
CPU it would be good so yeah I think we
gotta give up for the day and maybe
tomorrow come up with a game plan of
like how we're gonna power this thing
but we're close but this is the this is
the best case this is the best case if
it's just the eight pin we can't power
it worst case is something here is
broken in which case we are way more
screwed okay I think it's time to call
it a night until tomorrow sweet prince
oh and I hope we can figure this out I
really do
next time on scrapyard Wars vertical
fights his doppelganger Nikki V you
really want to throw down
you want a rumble funk make are you
talking to you have the same person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
