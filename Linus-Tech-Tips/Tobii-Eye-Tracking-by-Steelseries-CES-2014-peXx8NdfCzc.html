brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital hey guys we're here at
the Toby and SteelSeries booth checking
out the SteelSeries eye tracker with
technology by Toby so we've talked about
this on the win show I track and all
that kind of stuff but now they're
actually at the booth what can you tell
me about this device so this is an eye
tracker and leaders have decided to to
launch on gaming eye tracker this year
in the middle of 2014 so there's gonna
come in gaming peripheral to the to the
gaming market in the middle of 2014 and
what we're doing now is basically we're
open up to the dev community to really
make it possible for developers to start
developing based on this device so this
is a dev kit the people can order now or
on our website and they can start
developing right now and make amazing
new games that sounds good and and just
so that people can play around with it
to begin with you guys said developed
for 50 to 100 games or is that coming
later or how's that going no so we can
make from our side we're gonna make when
when the device is launched we're going
to make integration from the outside to
round about 50 to 100 games but right
now we're reaching out to developers to
make source integration in their own
game so then then they can get this dev
kit with an SDK and they can they can
Scout to start developing this is one of
those things where developers need to
get behind it because direct interaction
with the game is while they can make
some of it it will always usually be
better if it's purely integrated by the
game developer so I think that's what
you guys are going for they have a few
demos here one of them is World of
Warcraft which I'm sure you guys will
see you soon
but it's cool seeing him target things
and run around with pressing very
minimal amounts of buttons what's your
favorite part about this and what's your
favorite part about the window side as
well so the key thing the key concept
there is basically that a gamer sit with
one hand on the Mars 100 keyboard and
what it suddenly gets with an eye
tracker is in an X extra way to
communicate with the game because the
computer knows where you're looking
so basically get another pointer so that
increases the communication bandwidth
with the gamer in the game so then you
can target things or you can imagine a
thief or a football game you would just
like look at the player who to pass the
ball to press a button then they go the
other huge thing I think is gonna be
immersion so when I look at you you know
the
look at that person in old so maybe
smiles who get pissed I don't know but
but you know if you walk into a say bar
in a game the characters are live a dead
today but now you can really look at the
character and they come to instant life
so they will just walk up to you start
talking to you or you look at somebody's
money person they get pissed so you can
really create fantastic new immersion
concepts without racking because the
real world really reacts to your eyes I
could really see this for RPG and horror
games so like an RPG game like you were
saying staring at someone's money purse
they're not gonna like that because
they're gonna wonder what you're up to
in a horror game if you start looking at
something too closely then it could jump
out at you and freak you out just stuff
like that is actually really interesting
because it adds a whole nother layer to
games something could be developed
purely around this so someone who's
trying to look for an idea for a game
you could make it completely around the
the eye tracker because like I said with
the the horror game thing I don't know
how else you could integrate that
without eye tracking so for it to really
work properly instead of just like okay
your character is standing generally in
front of it so we're gonna make a jump
at you now so then you get the concept
of this and that in the games you can
kind of do something with this or I'm
interested there and you're what do we
look is a very good prediction what you
think about and that's obviously a
fantastic thing to have it in game so
what are some of the ideas that you guys
have come up with I know we just saw
targeting and Wow
like I know there's something to do with
the mini-map and Starcraft 2 you can you
describe that in StarCraft we do well
it's pretty tedious to go down to the
mini-map up and down all the time but
what you do is basically you just press
a button you get the minima blown up or
your screen you look at what you want to
take take the take the view and you
release so it's a much faster way of
integrating mini-map and not to mention
that you don't have to lose control your
army now I'm not necessarily a dev but I
purchased into the oculus dev kit so if
someone out there just wanted to kind of
play with this and fool around with it
in the meantime could they pick this up
and how much would that cost them it can
go into our web websites or Toby CEO bwi
/i
and then an X on the end they can go in
there and they can purchase it for $95
I'm gonna get the hardware device
plugging me the USB and a dev kit and
their forum and documentation etc right
and they they could start playing around
certain games immediately or yeah we're
gonna have a certain examples with it
but there's not gonna be games
immediately when you order right now but
it's going to be at the
at the launch of the real product
basically cool so you could still show
it off and play with it and all that
kind of stuff which sounds extremely fun
