is the MSI n5 60 GTX TI Twin Frozr 2 and
as you may or may have not have figured
out by now this is based on the geforce
gtx 560 TI GPU from nvidia this is a one
gig graphics card and it is a very
special one because at the time of
filming this video anyway it looks like
the best price to performance I mean
really high performance gaming graphics
card on the market now NVIDIA has
actually even brought out the ti
designation we've haven't seen that for
a very long time when we saw it on one
of Nvidia's best-selling GeForce series
ever the geforce 4000 TI series
so the 4200 TI was the big one back in
the day and that was wow DirectX 8 so
we're up to DirectX 11 with this GPU we
also have support for all of invidious
technologies so let's have a look at
them they're all listed up here we've
got GeForce CUDA nvidia sli this
supports 2-way SLI
physics by nvidia as well as nvidia 3d
vision now there's a couple other things
on here as well msi afterburner is has a
little badge on the box too great little
overclocking utility works on not only
MSI cards but other ones too as well as
it being ready for 3d mark 11 I guess
that's one way of saying that it is
DirectX 11 ready 3d mark 11 is also
included with this card for with the
value of 20 bucks that's kind of cool it
has a three year warranty in the US
Canada and Mexico and let's see what
else they have to say for the alright
yeah this is a twin frozer 2 cards so
what that means is that we have MSI's
famous twin frozer two cooler on this
instead of the stock cooler so I'll show
you guys a little comparison against the
stock cooler in a bit so they're saying
up to 20 degrees cooler it also features
military class 2 so you've got all of
MSI's military class there we go it's
finely focused technology included on
this board it is a custom PCB board ok
and it is an overclocked card so we've
got voltage adjustment and see what else
MSI has to say for himself so here
they're giving us some more details
about their military class
once up which i think is just great
because I found that on military class
cards I've actually noticed less less
squealing because of the higher quality
components that are being used and what
MSI also has to say for themselves is
that it's more efficient delivers more
current and is going to last longer
here's another little plug for MSI
Afterburner which is my personal
favorite and here's some media comments
about the Twin Frozr - I hear some more
information about twin fros or - as well
as a sneak peek of the card which you
can't really see because of the
anti-static bag but direct contact
design with the heat pipes dual pwm fans
okay nickel plated copper base dual
super pipes I'll show you the super pipe
so there's actually four total heat
pipes and then two super pipes
high-density heatsink and here's a
little thermal comparison against the
reference claw though I don't know how
relevant that is because I think this
box has probably been reused from the
460 twin frozer so either way it suffice
to say the Twin Frozr 2 is usually a
much better performer than the stock
cooler on pretty much anything
alright DirectX 11 support okay most of
this we've covered already how or we
will cover once we get it opened up
minimum system requirements okay PCIe
16x yep two 6-pin PCI II power
connectors and a minimum 500 watt or
greater power supply those are probably
the most important bits this is a 1 gig
card so it has 1,024 Meg's of video
memory and that's finally yes finally 3
minutes and 40 seconds in get the box
opened up alright so first thing as
usual for me is accessories so MSI's
boxes I'm used to them now down on the
bottom is where we find all the
accessories so here's our quick user's
guide here is a driver disk don't use
this download the latest version ha
download the latest version now we have
a DVI to VGA adapter in case you're
still using a VGA monitor and then we
also have a mini HDMI if we can get it
to focus to regular HDMI out adapter
here's 3d mark 11 and just for one lucky
viewer I am going to give away my copy
of 3d mark 11 so
I'm going to scratch this off and
whoever gets this first you are now the
proud owner of 3d mark 11 advanced
edition Oh hold on that's somewhat
obscured there we go all right
congratulations okay next we have the
560 GI series something about their live
updates so you can use that to update
your drivers and whatnot and finally we
have a few more accessories and then
we're going to have a look at the sexy
gtx 560 TI graphics card so to dual
molex to PCIe 610 power adapters
although as I so frequently say if you
don't have a proper power supply to run
this card with a couple PCIe 6 with a
couple PCIe 6 pin powers then you should
probably be looking at a power supply
upgrade as well a balanced system is a
happy system all right let's get this
anti-static bag out of here and I have a
feeling at this time that this card is
going to look very similar to our old
friend the GTX 460 ha there's a little
bird told me that it might actually be
using the same overall PCB layout so
first thing I'm going to do is compare
it to the GTX 460 Hawk side-by-side or
rather top to bottom okay so you can see
they are both using the same edition of
the Twin Frozr to heatsink so I'll show
you the super pipes here on the bottom
of the 560 Ti you see how two of them
the ones that go out further away from
the GPU core which is in the middle are
actually thicker than the others so
those are the super pipes the reason
they're thicker --zz they carry heat
more efficiently that way and they have
further to go so that's why msi made the
design decision to make those ones the
outermost key pipes okay so let's have a
look at the top of the part here you can
see some memory chips down there you can
also see some other components you can
see the the termination ends of those
heat pipes so there are the fat ones on
the on the outside and the skinny ones
on the inside there all right you can
see some MSI Twin Frozr to branding on
the top of that heatsink let's flip it
over
see what the back has to say for itself
so here I'm going to get this out of my
way so that it's not not here anymore
alright let's take off these protective
covers so I've never quite understood I
mean it comes pretty well packed I don't
think that these are really necessary
but they're there one way or the other
so no sense complaining about it so here
we will find our SLI bridge as I
mentioned before this card supports only
2-way SLI otherwise you'd need two
bridges for three-way and four-way SLI
you've also got on the back of the cart
the location of the GPU you can see
where all the memory is soldered on you
can see where all of the connectors are
soldered on you can see that does use a
standard PCI Express 16x 2.0 data
connection and then also on the back you
can see where the power connectors are
soldered so let's move around to the
back of the cart and that is where we
will find two PCIe 6 pin power
connectors as mentioned before now the
wiring of the fans is a little bit
custom because there's one mount here or
rather one plug here and then it's going
to go up here where it splits into two
and then powers each fan individually
let's have a look at the connectors
we've got on the back here so we've got
our mini HDMI as well as dual DVI you
can see the backplate actually has some
ventilation slots so you can see by the
design of the cooler there so this has a
bit of a there's a bit of a shroud thing
going on here so some of the exhaust
from this fan is going to go out the
back of the card but most of it is going
to go through and then be exhausted out
here and down on the bottom and what
that means is that if you are running a
twin fros or two card you will get
better GPU temps guaranteed versus a
stock cooled part but you should make
sure you have adequate case airflow to
move that heat out of your case because
it's not going to be exhausting it
externally so two more things before we
wrap up here I want to do the quick PCB
comparison against the GTX 460 Hawk and
see if I can notice any differences
so actually well here you guys can
always pause and help me well here's one
here's one the 460 Hawk has the GP UV
switches on it okay whereas the GP UV
switches are actually not present okay
because remember this is not a hawk
addition card even though it appears to
be using a hawk PCB oh there's also
there's also another change here this
little component is here but it's not
here now the gtx 560 GPU while it is a
different GPU then the one powering the
GTX 460 it has more pipes it is more
optimized however it is pin compatible
so that's why MSI was able to release an
aftermarket PCB 560 Ti so quickly
because they were able to pretty much
drop it onto the PCB looks like they
were able to make a couple minor changes
see here's another one here there's one
component here when there is not one on
the GTX 460 Hawk and that's pretty much
all the changes that really pop out to
me right now oh yeah no here's one so
this is on the hawk and this is not here
interesting I'm no electrical engineer
so I can't tell you what all of that
means but here I'm going to bring my 560
Ti back I'm going to put my 460 walk
away and then I'm going to bring up a
regular reference NVIDIA GTX 560 so how
do these guys compare well you can see
the reference one has a single eighty
millimeter fan whereas the hawk has dual
92 millimeter fans the reference one
does have an external exhaust design
although oh no it's not external exhaust
so it's about half and a half so it's
probably going to be exhausting a little
bit more than the twin throws or two so
you can see there's ventilation here but
it's not going to be all it's not going
to be exhausting nearly everything not
even half and half because you can see
there's more ventilation holes here and
more in the top so it's going to be
kicking most of the heat out into the
case as well Twin Frozr - I would
definitely expect to perform better
although I haven't had a chance to test
it yet but I will you can see that the
reference cooler hold on sorry I'm
moving it so that I can see better the
reference cooler looks to have three
copper heat pipes
as well as a flower heatsink design kind
of like Intel's reference LGA 1155
heatsink okay
the PCB layout is probably going to be
very very different yes it looks very
very different already maybe not that
different pretty different though versus
the hawk PCB that the GTX 560 TI
overclocked from MSI has borrowed you
can see that this PCB is actually
slightly longer than the hawk PCB that
MSI is using and other than that I guess
that's all the physical comparisons that
I wanted to make they're both dual slot
coolers of course very few performance
single slot cards these days thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the gtx
560 TI 1 gig overclocked card from msi
one thing I also should mention before I
wrap up here is that this card is
overclocked to 580 megahertz
on the core that is versus a rather 880
megahertz on the core versus 822 on the
reference card as well as 4.2 gigahertz
on the RAM versus about 4 gigahertz on
the NVIDIA reference card</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
