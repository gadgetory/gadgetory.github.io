s102 series of USB flash drives this is
a USB 3 drive that is actually priced
not that badly compared to even USB 2
drives so it's USB 3 ready I'm 2 point 0
backward compatible that is important
although they are all in theory you must
be 2 point 0 backwards compatible I can
tell you guys right now the USB 3 drive
that I normally used doesn't necessarily
work in some scenarios such as for
example booting to it from a USB 2 port
or a USB 3 port on an older motherboard
so there you go if they're saying it's
USB 2.0 backward compatible I hope it
also includes all of that compatibility
as well boosted speeds up to a hundred
megabytes per second read and no they
don't actually rate the ok oh this is
the pro version of the drive so there's
a non-pro dry foot pro version of the
drive that's not quite as fast so this
is forty five percent faster is what
they're saying supports USB 3
specification with compatible USB 2.0
hot plug and play and it comes with free
norton internet security a 60-day
version let's pull to open let's see how
easy their packaging is to open I am
sort of the expert on how easy packaging
is to open okay it was easy to open but
not necessarily easy to open cleanly
there we go oh eva is that even more
languages inside or something what is
all this warranty statement oh that's
kind of cool okay exclusive downloads at
82 dash group com or no adata oh well um
hmm oh I understand so it's supposed to
rip along the perforations and then
you're supposed to fold it down so be
careful when you're opening it up
otherwise you might not be able to read
all of the packaging assign it does have
a lifetime warranty if you register
online and then there's all this stuff
which okay well we'll see if it still
works after being dropped it probably
does online customer service aha a DAT
dash group com / en /
rusev underscored download there you go
so that's where you go so the casing
it's actually fairly nice it's made of
metal which is nice for for a USB Drive
these days it's hard to find ones that
are actually you know have some design
that go into them because they've become
a bit of a commodity item it's got the
little pro thing going on s 10 to 16 gig
USB 3 like I said metal the cap is
plastic belt and the back is plastic
that probably makes them fit together a
little bit better and then it is held on
by the little indents here wow let's go
ahead and fire it up let's see how long
it takes to copy a file to it oh wait my
USB three test bench isn't plugged in
hmm okay you may minute so here we go
guys we've got about 1 gig of data here
and we are going to copy it over to our
test folder and see how long it takes to
copy a gig of data I think that's
unrealistic but yeah we're gonna find
out how long it actually takes I think
it's probably catching up to where it
thinks it is right now I'll let you guys
do the math oh yeah that's not too bad
oh that's nothing sorry about that I'm
related
oh there we go it kind of picked up at
the end there guys han is starting to
get pretty disappointed so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at a data as Pro Series usb3 drive don't
