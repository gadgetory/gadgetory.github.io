and IT teams provisioned new devices
secured them and maintained them
manually most often VA slow tedious and
error-prone command-line interface these
days there are certainly automated tools
to make large-scale deployments easier
but by and large the nuts and bolts work
is still done exactly the same way why
well that's a great question and it's
one that Cisco sponsored a little jaunt
over to their Vancouver office here to
explore so let's find out tell me the
answer is that it doesn't have to be
that way anymore
and the Cisco folks created a fun little
demo for me to show you guys what
they're calling intent-based networking
so to get things started I go ahead and
connect to their Wi-Fi and then right
away I get a ping from the community
bought built into WebEx teams with some
useful information to help me find my
way after a short conversation community
bought or CB as I like to call it let me
know that the people I'm supposed to
meet are in the quad room and then asks
if I'd like a group chat where I can
arrange to join them invite them for
coffee or do whatever it is that
executive types do on a Friday afternoon
turns out with the Cisco folks it's
grabbing pints surprisingly cool here by
the way 10 out of 10 would paint again
anyway the next part of the demo was
supposed to have me have some kind of
Wi-Fi trouble with video streaming or
something but it was really hard for an
office full of Cisco access points to
have Wi-Fi troubles so I'm just gonna
have to walk you guys through like a
hypothetical what could have happened
now 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi isn't as fast as
5 gigahertz but it still has one key
advantage range the problem is that the
instant someone fires up one of those
puppies it basically jams every 2.4
gigahertz device in the vicinity so a
Cisco intent-based network can be
constantly monitoring for this kind of
interruption it can let CB know so she
can make sure that you're not like
tearing your hair out trying to you know
find a spot with better reception or
something stupid like that and then this
is the part where it gets really crazy
she can even fix it for you in the
background moving you over to a 5
gigahertz channel or recommending that
you do so yourself depending on your
configuration like this is the kind of
thing that for years has been
impractical or even impossible with
traditional troubleshooting because by
the time attack were to wade their way
over here through the cue of my printer
won't print messages and finally get to
my desk to diagnose my Wi-Fi well you
know Barney from accountings lunch is
not only not in the microwave anymore
it's like down the street there at the
treatment plant and so anything
intermittent like that
has been traditionally very hard to
diagnose that is why we needed a new way
and before you freak out the idea behind
this data collection is not to get rid
of the entire IT staff but rather to
stop wasting their time
now Internet of Things has become kind
of like an annoying buzzword but that
doesn't change that the sheer number of
connected devices that needs to be
managed per IT staffer is gonna explode
when a room like this one goes from you
know three ethernet jacks over here and
a handful of people on their laptops
over there to every you know phone and
and thermostat and speaker and TV and
even lightbulb having its own connection
I mean you don't want to be provisioning
every stupid light individually do you
although that that said the jokes about
how many sis admin's does it take to
change a lightbulb do basically write
themselves at that point the idea here
is with intent based networking the
manual work goes away so you plug the
light in it announces itself then based
on its identification it can be
provisioned on the network secured and
then cord it off from higher priority
devices like say for example a video
streaming smartboard over here and all
of that without the lengthy setup
process because remember guys even 5
minutes is a long time when you're doing
it a thousand times like you would with
the lights in an office building like
this one and hidden away in this corner
of what they call the lab are some of
the hardware keys to what's going on
here so this this right here is their
4800 series access point and this is one
unique piece of kit because in addition
to being a sick Wi-Fi access point it
has dedicated hardware to gather
location data like remember how the
network was helping me find my
colleagues from before so you used to be
able to find out where a user was but
the old way used multiple access points
to triangulate
location frankly it didn't work very
well the new way uses what's called a
phased antenna array to detect
nanosecond differences in the time of
arrival of beaconing signals from your
device to determine where you are to
within a meter and it can do it even if
you aren't actually connected to the
hotspot I can't believe they're just
letting me wander around in here like
there is no one supervising me right now
then there's these guys here so this
here is a pair of Cisco's catalyst 9000
switches which are apparently selling
like hotcakes
these not only do real-time monitoring
but they can actually going back to our
microwave example log data as well to
help DNA Center which is the software
brain that controls the whole operation
find patterns that will make diagnosing
intermittent issues much easier and DNA
Center enables some other fancy tricks
so with encrypted data which is becoming
more and more common the content of a
data packet can be read directly by the
piece of equipment that is traveling
through so whether it's an unauthorized
user trying to gain access to the
network or a nasty malware in a Word
document you can't see it but using
machine learning it can look at the
behavior of it how big it is where it's
going what it's trying to do and then
using decades of experience along with
AI and machine learning it can get with
a high degree of accuracy this packet is
bad and this one is safe now obviously
this stuff isn't perfect yet this is
this is just the beginning I mean I got
to tell you guys Ã§b let me down big time
when I asked for directions to the
bathroom for example so it is a really
good thing that Anju is here because
that could have been a really bad scene
but that's okay because the point of
this technology isn't replacing people
anyway it's about leveraging the power
of the community
developers that Cisco is building called
dev net to make our networks more
efficient and more secure through
software if the network itself is a
software platform then it can use all
the data that it has data that would
have otherwise been wasted intelligently
based on intent whether that's the
intent of the administrator or the
intent of the user
that's intent based networking and a
really cool example of this was
completed just last year at UBC's main
library so they were able to use
location data from student smartphones
to determine which parts of the building
needed air-conditioning and heating and
they were able to save seven percent on
their energy costs that is a big deal
and frankly a fairly rudimentary example
so for the network admins out there the
message here is that it might be time to
start dabbling in programmability and as
for you developers well it might be time
for you to explore the networking side
too and you can both learn more at
developer
so thanks to Cisco for sponsoring this
video and thanks to you guys for
watching if it sucked
you guys know where that button is but
if it was awesome get subscribed hit
that like button or check out the link
to where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also link down
there is our merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should definitely join
so do you need some tech tips I got
nothing for you oh so it's just still
going we broke Cisco's microwave</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
