about it
transferring files around to remote pcs
at speeds upwards of one gigabyte per
second it's a thousand megabytes per
second well today we're not only going
to do it we are going to give you some
tips and tricks that will hopefully help
you out when the time comes to move to
10 gigabit yourself whether it's at work
or at home
and on the subject of work I thought to
myself hey how about clearing some space
on my desk at work by building a PC
under the desk wha drop a like on the
video if you're amped to see my upcoming
desk PC build blog
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
click on the link in the video
description to learn more you know I
still remember how mind-blowing it was
like the first time that I saw something
transfer over my network it 60 to 70
megabytes per second with the on-board
Gigabit LAN port on some enforce board
that I had then shortly afterward my
mind was blown again when the PCI bus
bottleneck was removed and thanks to
onboard PCI Express gigabit networking I
could transfer files thanks to my trusty
Dimond Max 9 120 gig raid 0 boot drive
at over a hundred megabytes per second
Wow then for the last 10 years well it's
as though time has pretty much been
standing still means sure the enterprise
space is getting 40 gigabit and 100
gigabit links but it really feels like
about a decade ago the entire industry
had a meeting and decided that NAG
gigabit is good enough for consumers and
small businesses and let's just leave it
at that well I say no more we are using
and I'm using this term fairly loosely
here affordable hardware to go 10 gig at
the office today it begins with the Nix
that is to say network interface cards
will be using Intel X 540 T twos with
the only difference between it and the
t1 being that it has two ports instead
of well one and while any 10 gigabit
card will knock the socks off of a
gigabit one we chose these for two
reasons one their Intel which is
basically the industry standard for
prosumer network cards not to mention
our testing with them is gone very well
and two because they're both somewhat
affordable at 300 bucks a pop on eBay
although I got some of mine for cheaper
and available in an rj45 equipped
variant this is important because we
wanted to use Ethernet cables rather
than the expensive SFP+ connectors and
direct-attached copper cables that we
were using in our previous 10 gigabit
set up the reason for that is that while
that configuration worked well for us
before starting out with pcs attached
daisy-chaining to each other actually
then moving up to using the backbone
links on a 48 port Netgear GS 752 T XS
which it doesn't play nicely with
running cabling through the walls
definitely desirable for an office space
and it's not scalable and if we want to
run more pcs on 10 gig at a time we need
a 10 gig switch with more ports and
pretty much the switch right now if you
don't want to spend an absolute fortune
and you know then you might as well get
sfp+ gear is the XS 7 12 T 12 port or
it's 8 port little brother from Netgear
and those use rj45 connectors all right
so it's simple right plug in some
ethernet cables and bippity-boppity-boo
your transferring files at a thousand
megabytes per second right actually not
quite first you'll need to make sure
that you're using cat 6a cables if you
want reliable data transfer over a
reasonable distance and second and you
may not have considered this but 10
gigabit is so fast that it exceeds the
six gigabit per second limit of
third-generation SATA so even if you
have a wicked fast SSD drive you'll be
limited to speeds in the neighborhood of
500 to 550 megabytes per second and
while PCI Express SSDs that overcome
this bottleneck do exist
I stole our Intel 750 series and put it
in my personal rig so I ended up using
other solution I've got our 24 SSD
storage server on one end the one that
we built in this video here and I've got
a test bench with that 128 gigabyte kit
of Dominator Platinum ddr4 from Corsair
on the other end with a free and easy to
use utility called soft perfect Ram disk
used to treat that round like a hard
drive so with such fast storage on
either end it's much easier to evaluate
the performance of the actual network
link which frankly didn't go so hot on
the first kick at the can I don't know
who these people getting perfect 10 gig
performance out of the box are or how
many horseshoes they had to put up their
butts to make them so damn lucky
but I was seeing this weird cap at
around 300 to 350 megabytes per second
now to be clear that is still a
significant improvement and already well
worth the upgrade for our purposes but I
wanted more demet I paid for more and
thanks to an amazing series of posts on
thus innovate blog which you should
definitely check out we can link them
below the video I was able to do much
better than that mostly so the first tip
from them was this great tool called NTT
TCP that has a command-line interface so
not the friendliest thing but that they
simplified by basically showing you
where to plug in the program install
path and machine IP addresses and boot
it's off to the races so this tool
revealed that my two machines were
capable of more than one gigabyte per
second performance between them so what
gives well time to dig into the Advanced
Settings to see if there's anything that
we can tweak I started by enabling jumbo
packets on all clients involved in the
transfer and on my network switch side
note here it doesn't seem to matter if
the values don't match up exactly as
long as your switch is set to something
higher than your NICs so this means that
now effectively the data packets sent
back and forth are bigger which is
better for a high speed transfer of
large files next I tweaked receive side
scaling a feature that leverages more
CPU cores for network transfers and I
set it to match the settings with my
number of logical processors on my PC so
16 on my 5960 x test bench 8 on my 6700
K test bench and 16 on my Xeon server
and finally I increased the size of both
the send and receive buffers to their
maximum
this increases memory usage but can
yield extra performance so then what did
I get well performance wise over the
original numbers in ntt TCP not much but
my real-world transfers were much higher
in fact more higher than they should
have been but I'm not going to complain
and I was seeing sustained speeds of
over double my original transfer rates
with that said not all is necessarily
rosy and for whatever reason maybe some
of you sharp people out there can go
and contribute your comments below some
transfers are faster or slower than
others so I only have actually putting
together two test benches with brand
spanking new installations of Windows 10
and Windows Server 2012 r2 just for the
sake of trying to eliminate as many
variables as possible I was still
running into weirdness where one machine
with a particular OS would saturate the
connection writing to the Wanek SSD
server but then be capable of half or
60% of that speed when reading from it
and then another would saturate on reads
and then limp along writes I mean that's
the one you're looking at here by the
way but as snake-bitten as I seem to be
when it comes to networking stuff
limping along in this case is still 500
plus megabytes per second so I guess
I'll just have to deal with my 34
gigabyte file transferring a little
slower than it otherwise would overall
very happy with the results and speaking
of being happy with the results
Squarespace if you were thinking to
yourself gee I'd like to build myself a
website but I sure don't want to be
unhappy with the results BAM pick out a
template on Squarespace customize that
template to build yourself whatever it
is you're trying to build yourself you
want to build a store a company website
on you know menu a blog portfolio use
their simple templates and their
powerful creation tools and their 24/7
tech support and it starts at only $8 a
month so it's affordable and you won't
break the bank and I'm sure I have more
talking points but I think you guys
pretty much get the point you want to
build an easy to use reliable website
Squarespace com they've got a free trial
which you can sign up for two day and
then if you end up liking the site that
you create you can look into their
affordable plans pretty freakin awesome
there's no credit card required by the
way to try out the trial so pretty cool
when and if you decide to sign up for
Squarespace make sure though to use
offer code Lynas and get 10% off your
first purchase hmm yeah so that's it
