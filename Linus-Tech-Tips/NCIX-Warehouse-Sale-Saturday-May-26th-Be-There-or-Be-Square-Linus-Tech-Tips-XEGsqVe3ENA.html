sale sorry I was meant to the turtle
store up in here so it's up unit 135 462
0 Viking Way in BC and then it's a tower
Ontario warehouse I forget the address
but I'll put a link on in the
description under the video so you guys
can check out all the legit deals that
are in Ontario as well so it is a
different excuse X from BC to Ontario
but we're gonna do a quick tour of so I
think this is like the free stuff shelf
so there's like you know like a cool
urns and ink cartridges sort of some
stuff like that it's just your like $1
cathode kit sweet that's a 4-inch oh
it's kind of handy actually okay moving
on sorry sorry um so here we have sort
of the random stuff and there's some
really cool stuff here including things
like raid cards so if you're interested
in sort of like weird high-end stuff
that honestly is hard for NCIX to get
rid of open box but hey if you come to a
warehouse sale you might be interested
we actually have a couple now you 244
eyes so if you wanted to grab like both
of them you can actually team them in
the LSI software so you could have you
know an 8i and they're like 100 bucks
each which is yeah way way below cost we
have things like issue soundcard for 40
bucks I think there's a fatality
soundcard around here for 40 bucks we've
got CPU coolers for 3 bucks which is
like hard to go wrong right um even like
high-end stuff we have an essence st
with the headphone amp and that's a
hundred and nine bucks cases down here
right you've got really cool cases so
fractal design define our three 440 box
and tag 302 for looks like this one
doesn't have a price tag yet so you know
for something pick this up the high-end
silverstone GE o 4d do six forty five
bucks 55 bucks these are high-end
aluminum cases um keep on moving here
aha hard drives so hard drives are not
cheap anymore except maybe they are so
these are factory refurbished ectis out
these are sealed so most of these are
not even open box in any way shape or
form I saw really cool when there was
like a yeah constellation
99 and I saw a constellation three
terabyte four for $2.99
that's okay it's in there somewhere
someone will get it more cases so
Google's of cases things like NZXT
phantom for 70 bucks Coolermaster half x
480 bucks um pentek mini p180 20 bucks
20 dollars i mean yeah okay moving right
along we go out a NV all-in-one color
inkjet wireless printer so this is sort
of like printers and bigger stuff land
here's an all-in-one for 700 bucks we've
got some shuttle bare-bones that are
pretty cheap as well
power supplies so power supplies are
going to be in the hub on hand let's
find some good examples of course their
600 watt for 40 bucks we've got a cooler
master 400 watt for 15 bucks once again
these are all box but the whole idea
behind open box products here is that
these were returned and validated at
some point that they actually work you
do have a few days of do a warranty to
go ahead and make sure that it's working
for you and then you can bring it back
and get a replacement if it is indeed
dead aah-ha motherboards so this is
where you're going to find some of the
craziest deals p67 boards which might i
remind you as long as you check the
model and the manufacturer has updated
it are compatible with Ivy Bridge CPUs
you just don't get quick sync and you
don't have the Intel USB 3 and lucid
hydrogel lucid logic virtue MVP so yeah
we have p67 boards for as little as $30
which is I mean if you throw an Ivy
Bridge CPU in there you've got a pretty
wicked little machine so lots in the
range of 50 bucks to 30 bucks to 70
bucks 70 bucks is where you start
getting into z68 apparently we have $50
z68 as well holy cow
that's that's a really good deal so
that's even even newer chipset I'm
moving right along on motherboards here
more p67 some em ATX boards and AMD
boards let's see we got some high-end
boards that are cheap do you want
assassin to 99.99 right what ah well I'm
probably gonna get this one changed that
seems a little bit low but do on gorilla
which is pretty old so that's 130 bucks
that's an LGA 1366 still a good deal
then here's the random doodads
um I don't things like
no wireless adapter 10 bucks I haven't
actually looked through this yeah the
three mousepad like Thailand X fans from
the open box fan not much that can go
wrong so it's like yeah cables DVI to
HDMI cable no price on that this whole
bin is probably going to be like one
price or something and then moving into
monitor LAN so we've got things like
27-inch monitors for 500 bucks that's a
Dell 27-inch Iesus Pro art monitors we
have a few of those it looks like they
don't have pricing on them yet graphics
cards there's oh yeah there there's a
pro art 23 inch for 149 bucks just like
stupid graphics cards there's some good
deals 57 70 80 bucks GTX 560 TI top for
me 280 bucks so like I said all this
stuff is certainly well below cost gtx
570 230 bucks so those are msi lots and
lots and lots of video cards let's see
what kind of cheap monitor deals we got
$60 LED is out of 20 inch 19 inch so 60
bucks for 19 inch LED LCD this is a
really good deal this is the s20 7950
deep this is an HD 3d ready monitor for
300 bucks 27-inch absolutely beautiful
monitor the one with that cool
industrial design this thing with 3d
glasses included so it's compatible of
3d blu-ray and whatever else you want as
long as your video card can drive it
this is this is another one this is one
I was actually thinking about picking up
because I don't have a light boost 3d
monitor for myself 350 bucks for a
27-inch a su slight boost 3d vision
monitor these are I'm aware of the bump
print issue on this model that some
people have had but these are actually
factory returns back to us with it fixed
so whatever you buy at the open box
warehouse sale should not have the bump
print issue so there you go it's
actually the open box one is not not a
bad bet in that case so I think that
pretty much sums it up so remember guys
in Richmond for six to zero Viking Way
come check out the warehouse sale it's
on
Saturday May that whatever it is that
may the 26th so get here early get in
line because there will be lineup if you
want some of these crazy deals and don't
