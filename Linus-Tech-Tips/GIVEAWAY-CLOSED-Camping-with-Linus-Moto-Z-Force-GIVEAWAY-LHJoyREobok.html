to be a problem here Oh awesome that
looks great are you sure you don't want
one Roy that thing ain't natural
watch this
ah well you sure this is a good idea
this is a great idea
I'm not holding that even anything yeah
there's only one way to find out what
you gotta try the lemon juice path
liners here

compass yeah absolutely that way can you

here this is cozy
what are we watching chicks like it
so that was definitely a little
different I hope you guys enjoyed this
little LTTE short with my uncle Roy and
I want to take this time to address a
couple of more important things number
one is a huge thank you to Lenovo for
sponsoring this little project and
providing us with their Moto Z force
their shatterproof screen high
performance 21 megapixel camera pretty
much you name it flagship device that
also features the real star of the show
their moto mods which allow you to with
a quick snap have a high-capacity
battery a built-in projector or even a
high-performance speaker depending on
what your needs are which leads us to
the other big star of the show the big
giveaway you can find the full details
in the video description but one lucky
viewer will be taking home not only a
moto Z force but also all three of the
accessories I just talked about cool
right so guys if you like this video hit
that like button but if you disliked it
hit that dislike button but if you're
going to do that leave a comment as well
let me know what you'd like to see in
the future for these LTT shorts things
because I can pretty much guarantee this
is not the end of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
