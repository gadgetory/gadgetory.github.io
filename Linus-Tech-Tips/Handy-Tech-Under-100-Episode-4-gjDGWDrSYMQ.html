last episode of handy tech under $100
and I think this might be the best one
yet so here we go again
with its power loss protection
affordability and performance the SP 924
may data makes upgrading to an SSD
remarkably safe and simple item number
one is something I've had for years and
only used a dozen or so times to which
you might reply - that doesn't sound
very handy at all but you'd be mistaken
sometimes it's not about how often you
need something but more about how
desperately you need it when the time
comes this is a 2 amp 12 volt and 5 volt
external power supply with a molex
connector on the end I can't find this
particular one anywhere anymore but
there's a similar item on Amazon it
lacks the SATA connector but you can
always use an adapter if you need to
hook up a hard drive or an optical drive
I've used this thing when I needed to
hook up drives but I didn't have an
enclosure lying around I've used it to
bin cheap fans to find the ones with the
best under Bolton characteristics I've
used it to test LED strips to find out
which ones were which colors since none
of them are ever labeled and every time
I use it I save at least 10 minutes of
running around trying to find a doorstop
power supply then running around trying
to find a paper clip to short out the
green and the black wires and to top it
off this is obviously a much more
compact and tiny solution compared to
having a power supply all over your desk
next up we've got something that I
actually just bought and I am like so
stoked on it that I might pick up a
couple of dozen of them for the office
and home now that this one has exceeded
my expectations so thoroughly this is
the aptly named Legrand desktop USB
slash multi outlet charger station with
surge protection basically I'm sure
everyone has had to dig around under
their desk at some point or another
trying to find another outlet just like
everyone has dug through the same three
bins repeatedly all the while being
certain that they had at least one more
USB wall adapter to charge their phone
and tablet or some
well no more if your desk has a built-in
cable management hole you can drop this
in and stick it in that hole just like
that you know what I mean if it doesn't
have a cable management hole then you
can either drill one yourself or just
clip it to the back of the desk with the
included adapter it's got a built-in
surge protector and gives you three
normal wall outlets one for your PC one
for your monitor and one for I don't
know speakers or something and then two
USB charging ports totaling 2.1 amps
it's 45 bucks when you can find stuff
with similar functionality for closer to
25 or just mount power bars all over the
place for next to nothing but the
integrated USB ports the professional
look and the mounting options are what
sold me on this one
it's very ergonomic I mean they even
thought of little things like putting
the outlets upside down in case you have
a bulky wall wart that you want to plug
in great product and now on to our last
item one that I actually have mixed
feelings about it's more than I would
have liked to spend and it's hardly
perfect more on that in a moment but
it's much better than almost anything
else out there because most phone and
small tablet stands are complete and
utter garbage this is the cooler master
jazz mini it's a well-constructed solid
aluminum foam slash phablets Milosh
small tablet stand with attractively
finished accents on the hinges plastic
end pieces to keep your phone from being
scratched on your table from being
scratched and a rubber foot on the
bottom to keep it from slipping around
on the table the uses for it are pretty
much whatever you can think of I've got
a handful of them as you can see here
and I use it to prop up my phone to
watch shows in the bath I use it to
avoid putting my phone down on my desk
where it can get scratched by random
debris since I'm a bit of a you know
bareback kind of guy if you know what I
mean I don't use a phone case and from
reading reviews on the Apple Store it
looks like everyone has their own idea
of how to use it best which leads me to
my criticisms number one the silver
version very attractive by the way is
only available on the Apple store
although thankfully the other colors are
available elsewhere and number two while
the stand is perfect for portrait mode
with these nice little rubber pieces up
here to keep the phone from getting
scratched in land
Gate mode it actually sits up against
the metal here so you got metal to metal
contacts and I wish there was another
piece of rubber there it's still better
than the other options it's just not
quite perfect and so they that's the
jazz mini anyway speaking of phones why
not save a few bucks on the plan for
yours today's sponsor is ting and the
worst thing we could think of to say
about them is that they're not available
in Canada their whole thing is they want
customers to have the benefits of a
smaller mobile carrier so personalized
customer service where someone actually
picks up your phone call instead of
putting you through an automated menu
and simple flexible billing options that
are designed to save you money but
without the typical small carrier issue
of not having good reception anywhere
because they're on some jenkki small
network there are a hundred percent
upfront about the fact that they're
actually running on the Sprint network
so hit up the link in the video
description now to try out their savings
calculator where you enter the details
from your last three bills and see if
you'll save money switching to Kings pay
only for what you use system they
actually did a study recently and they
found that 98% of people were going to
save money by switching to ting so
that's pretty cool go check it out
anyway with that out of the way it's
time for the full disclosure part of
handy tech I think it's important for
these since they're basically product
recommendations that you know where the
products are coming from the external
power supply is something I picked up
years ago when I bought a bucket of y8
lean fans and wanted to find out which
ones were best for silent cooling the
LeGrand desk stand mounted surge
protector whatever the heck this thing
is I pick this up on Amazon a little
while ago because we need to do
something about the cable clutter in our
office particularly at charging stations
where we have like all of our camera
batteries charging or on test benches
where we got monitors and you know
desktops that are being moved on and off
all the time and we need something more
convenient and finally the jazz mini
stands were provided to my company for
doing b-roll footage of smart phones
when we couldn't find anything else out
there and just couldn't source something
that looked as good or was as well built
since then I've actually appropriated a
couple of them for personal use so
that's how they came to be in my
possession
anyway thanks for watching guys like it
if you liked it dislike the video if you
disliked it leave a comment with other
suggestions for future handy tech under
100 episodes if you like our videos the
links for where to buy these products
with our affiliate code are in the video
description along with the support us
link where you can buy a cool t-shirt
like this one give us a monthly
contribution or change your amazon
bookmark to one with our affiliate code
embedded so whenever you buy stuff we
get a small kickback that kind of stuff
