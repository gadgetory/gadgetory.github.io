and this thing is frickin do you smell
something holy what's up cool okay
look why is this coming apart oh my god
it's hot hole there smoke okay we got it
we got it back you ate the building just
turn that camera off let's go let's go

room everybody out in the parking lot is
anyone upstairs can you close on can you
clear upstairs please
Oh guys everybody go outside outside you
guys would all die okay
okay is everybody out here okay can you
guys come on over here Taryn why are you
filming
so guys basically um I don't know we're
in the middle of an unboxing server room
started spouting flames is really hot
okay you guys wait I'm just gonna do
this work what why not test it are you
gonna take that okay okay final I'll
just use it
good luck just Dennis come with me we
might as well mmm
there's a little bit of smoke but like
yeah oh look I don't see it look there's
no flames coming out of the grill it's
just hold on okay
I don't see any flames the screen still
on
you know what I think it's fine let's
just let's just bring everyone back in
okay there's uh you've got the door open
there's no more flames and smoke seems
mostly gone so I said seems mostly gone
did I sound sure okay so I'm going back
in if you guys don't want to stand in
the rain I guess you can do the same
thing actually here and where's ed um
can you check and see if your station
still on okay I'm gonna check and see if
the vault all good your workstations up
petabyte projects up
what about wanting 1x up what's going on
how can you have a fire in a server room
and have all the server's still work at
scuffle
that's weird handles not work
so what was on fire in here maybe it was
like the cloth or the insulation here
hold on here Dennis come with me I want
to have a look at the sprinklers like
why didn't the sprinklers go off this
one didn't catch come look
the sprinkler didn't go off everything
still powered on so like what was on
what was on fire it wasn't there wasn't
any of the servers
oh you know what maybe it was this can
of hairspray because april fools
this room is not flammable but thank you
to everybody in the comments who was so
concerned for my well-being that they
thought I was stupid enough to line
around what something flammable and as a
follow-up to the demonstration you just
saw here's a blowtorch here's this
fabric blue
I appreciate everybody's concern but I
mean it's a pretty good practice before
you crap all over someone to do like
four seconds of googling so that you can
find out
that the denim insulation every single
strand of this stuff is covered in a
boron fire retardant so yeah can you
burn it a little bit sure but it puts
itself out almost immediately hello
hello who's there that's not actually a
cell phone don't worry about it this is
tin customer service and we don't
correct those little errors yes my
friends ting is the mobile carrier that
is all about customer satisfaction you
call them you get put through directly
to a person assuming you are using a
phone and not your hands and there's
more good news the average ting bill is
only 23 bucks a month because you only
pay for exactly what you use
they've even got lower mobile data rates
these days so check them out we've got a
link in the video description and you
can see by just entering your last few
bills and how much you paid if ting can
save you money what's more is that if
you use our link you'll get 25 bucks in
service credit or towards a new device
