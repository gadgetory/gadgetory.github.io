well okay to be fair there's actually
not that many I don't think a Seuss
bamboo laptops actually sold that well
but this one is mine
and even though I haven't been using it
for a while it's been serving my parents
well for about a year now that is to say
well not fast even though the core i5 m
454 gigs of ddr3 and 1366 by 768 TN
screen might still be suitable for
browsing and word processing and other
light tasks back in 2010 most laptops
even thin ones unless your name was
Apple still had mechanical hard drives
so doing anything on it is painfully
slow these days but sentimental value is
a thing and this baby got me through
many a video export carrying it around
campus at BCIT between classes not even
able to close the lid because my windows
install was so borked so I'm not ready
to put her down just yet let's operate
Tunnel Bears the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open internet Tritonal bear
for free at the link below so just in
case you didn't catch that I'm going to
install an SSD in here in order to
breathe some new life into it and keep
it away from the recycling heaps if you
want to see how electronics recycling
can actually be devastating to the
environment check out this tech okie
episode up here but before we do that
let's explore what it's like to use this
thing with the hard drive in it to give
it the best possible performance I could
i've reformatted the drive this is a
very fresh version of Windows 7 and
we'll just try restarting it opening up
some programs general usability things
which is what this laptop would actually
be targeted at for now and see how it
stands up restarting the computer took
forever from pressing the restart button
to having Firefox loaded with the line
of text homepage on it took 2 minutes
and 13 seconds and then it didn't get
much better from there Foxit reader took
a very long time to show up to the point
where I was a little bit worried if it
was going to show up at all steam I was
actually 100% convinced wasn't working
and then had switched to try to demo
something else by the time that it
actually freakin loaded loading up any
browsers took a really long time but
navigating through Windows wasn't too
bad and once you had a browser actually
loaded and you were going through
various websites it did actually work
pretty well because the ddr3 RAM is
actually surprisingly fine
the only thing pulling this laptop down
that much is the hard drive so time to
swap it out what I'm going to swap in is
a vertex for 128 gig SSD from OCZ a
company that doesn't even exist anymore
I mean it's it's advertising in the
links on the front this is actually from
a pretty similar era that this laptop is
from and it costs like 50 bucks off
Amazon so you can get it pretty cheap no
big deal
I'm going to throw this in here not the
best SSD I could if I wanted to like
really destroy that hard drive and this
one has been used a bunch and has a ton
of clutter on it so the hard drive had a
best-case scenario and the SSD has like
a almost worst case scenario
check it out you like this actually lost
the original tray that I had for
mounting height right in here so I used
a little mod by just wrapping up some
paper and I mean it actually works
completely fine that was so much better
in my opinion it only took one minute
and two seconds to go from restart
button all the way to browser open with
the Linus tech tips page playing opening
up any program Foxit various browsers
origin because I didn't have steam
installed on there it's not my computer
anymore don't worry about it
it was easy none of it took very long I
didn't get frustrated actually trying to
figure out if a program was going to
open at all after I clicked on it it was
just there perfect and that's from a
very old laptop this isn't difficult to
do either you saw me swap the SSD and
for the hard drive it was not a
complicated process and then the bamboo
even has an optical drive so if you go
to the store and try to buy one of those
Windows key things that comes with the
disc you can even just do it that way
plain and simple it's cheap at only 50
dollars it's easy just a hard drive swap
for an SSD not a big deal and installing
Windows if you have trouble with that
you can check out this video up here
which is like an NCIX tech tips video
from way back arguably there isn't
really an improvement for the browsing
experience if you're going to spend most
of your time in a web browser
there is an improvement getting to the
browsing experience but once you're
there it's pretty much the same for hard
drive or SSD because that's RAM based I
don't really think upgrading the RAM is
a huge value add here as it's already
rather fast so yeah cheap easy not a big
deal also one thing to be careful of if
you're looking to buy a laptop for this
type of upgrade is that not all laptops
are very user upgradeable I would try to
find a teardown maybe on iFixit or some
other website of someone taking the
laptop apart so you can see how easy it
is to access the hard drive or SSD area
and possibly the RAM Kirti roll is a
site created by anime fans for anime
fans and they offer the most current
episodes of new shows straight from
Japan
like reezy row or Dragon Ball super and
they have a large collection of the most
popular anime series like Naruto and
bleach all of the content on their site
is professionally subtitled so head over
to crunchyroll.com slash Lynas and you
can sign up for a 30 day free trial of
crunchyroll premium if you enjoy the
many benefits of premium like 1080p
streaming getting new episodes of shows
straight from Japan within an hour of
their premiere and being able to stream
anywhere anytime from a variety of
devices like your phone tablet game
console computer whatever you can
continue your premium membership for not
the price of a train but 695 per month
so again hover to crunchyroll.com slash
Linus and check them out I would highly
recommend doing it if you have an old
laptop laying around but what do you
guys think let me know in the comments
down below like the video if you liked
it dislike if you just like to get
subscribed check out the links that we
have below where you can buy stuff like
olds not very currently recommended SSDs
that are really cheap or older laptops
maybe but you might be better off on
eBay or Craigslist for that or Kijiji as
we have in Canada anyways also down in
the description down below you can see a
place where you can buy our shirts in
the how to support us section and other
affiliate links and whatnot that are
down there if you want to see another
video check out this video where I
detail how to make a test bench for
basically free and we'll see you next
