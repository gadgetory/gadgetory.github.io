show time and we have a great show for
you guys today
did you roast me at all because that's
usually what I do with you when you're
when you're late no I'm a nice person
actually instead I was talking about how
exciting it is that this is the last
wine show that will be exclusive to
twitch TV I saw that coming
yes yeah so I don't know if you saw but
we streamed on the YouTube channels I
did we had 25,000 concurrent's watching
me talk about iommu groups and
virtualization imagine if we were doing
something that people cared about
imagine yeah this is my imagination face
well one of the big things one of the
like huge problems and I can't say
necessarily like what we talked about
but when I was down at twitch a while
ago we talked about like a side
discussion of discoverability and
searchability and stuff on twitch is
horrible yep finding what you want on
twitch is actually terrible in the last
it's going four years in the last four
years
Linus Media Group has like tripled in
terms of its YouTube viewership oh yeah
cuz every aspect of the business pretty
much has probably tripled in the last
four years except which viewership which
is half of what it was then yeah and
it's like either and remember too I'm
talking when show archive as well yeah
and like when when he's talking about
how it's gone like almost in the same
magnitude opposite direction when we
were hosting the LAN show when we first
got in this building yeah and it was in
what we called the library yes we were
consistently hitting 10k yeah so either
it's us which it doesn't seem to be
because literally every other platform
streaming or vaad is going in a complete
opposite direction yeah or it's
something about twitch and the type of
condon we used to be the only non gaming
content on the site which might have
made us stand out more like there
weren't any podcast and like except we
were on there they used to care because
we were pretty much the only version of
that so that would promote us yeah and
on Twitch to be relevant you basically
have to be streaming a lot at
because the discoverability is terrible
but there was something else too now I
know it's not ready yet don't freak out
but because we're gonna be simulcast
streaming yeah we might as well stream
on flow plane and wait hold on I have a
cool idea I have no issue I'm gonna have
to check with my my FB peeps in the chat
here okay but what if we absolutely
cranked like went absolutely bat-crap
crazy on the bitrate I think I think my
new group is gonna have to pony up for
that oh yeah oh yeah oh you think no cuz
we're we're helping you beta test okay
hold on a second cuz even if our
real-time transcode isn't working yet
because we'll be simultaneously
streaming floatplane pilots so I was
thinking the chat that we focus on is
the floatplane chat so people want to
chat on LAN show basically you can think
of it kind of like twitch Prime except
you just actually pay line as media
group instead of paying twitch a bunch
of money also low playing media is gonna
take some of it too but that's fine
they're cool guys
I'm expecting a but but get this if
people if people can't handle like a 30
megabits dream like something absolutely
nuts like we'd go crazy on it yeah if
they can't handle it they just watch the
video on Twitter YouTube yeah whatever
and they just use their floatplane chat
and they still get the benefit of the
floatplane membership and we can
experiment with different kinds of
streaming qualities and stuff like that
I don't know I've done I've done free
Cory I've done a bunch of streams on
floatplane the quality and the the delay
and everything is all really good so
like I'm sure before Kay stream you
could I haven't done that I have not
okay so one one thing to bring up here
yeah we haven't we haven't had our
floatplane lunch this week actually or
last not even that yeah so like we've
got we've got lots of we got some
because I got something really good for
you as soon as you're done okay so go
ahead you go this isn't actually about
floatplane ounces yeah well sort of if
you wanted to yeah yeah if you wanted to
stream a little time you're out of or or
youtube if you want to stream on either
of those right now I think you'd be
breaking the contract with twitch
because you have a sub
yeah I know they can kick a sigh so you
have to yeah I would just be aware of
that that's yeah yeah that's fine I
think we get like a couple hundred
dollars a month or something like that
like that's not gonna matter it's it's
not gonna make or break heart our
Twitter subscribers
yes but yeah compared to if you support
us on Flo please it's really not that
helpful so literally Linus Media Group
will make more money out of that and
then Flo playing media gets supported
too which is great might be able to
afford a razor yeah okay get this so
rough week um you know how a floatplane
needs like baller network connections
and stuff for some of the things it does
yeah I might be able to give floatplane
access to you know Vanek's Vancouver
internet exchange yes yeah yeah so um
Linus media group might be upgrading its
connection what to a dedicated
wavelength whoa directive annex okay
wouldn't that mean that you basically
have to be your own so we're working
with it's a small time our ISP although
they've grown a lot since we first
started working so through them they're
pretty cool guys um cuz I was like you
have to be your own I speak I've got
I've got the CTOs phone number a cell
phone number like he replies to my
emails at like 2:00 in the morning he's
a super cool guy yeah yeah it's freaking
awesome so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
like yeah I'm not gonna not gonna say
too much but like RISP dope guys local
guys I tell I don't you probably never
heard of them no but right there cool
guys and anyway so so it's gonna be a
dedicated 10 gigabit per second
wavelength straight to Vanek's no
switches and then we're actually I
couldn't afford the entire ten gigabit
per second of like Internet access
okay so it's going to be
five point five slumming it slide pipe I
have gig okay what's the I don't want to
know the exact Olli but I what's the
like differential I'll tell you I'll
tell you after hold on but but but
what's cool is that we're going to have
because they're bros and because it
doesn't cost them more because that
they're already in bannocks anyone else
in Vanek's we're gonna have ten gig too
so it's five gig 5.50 off phoenix but
then it's ten gig to AWS google Akamai
like basically ten gig to anyone that
matters you can go check it's got a list
of everyone that's on there so any way
you guys could definitely have some
Rackspace and I'm sure we could find a
way to make that that extra you know
five gigabit or whatever somewhat
beneficial OVH is on fanox so so we
could that's pretty great so we could we
could try and we could try and offset
your you know extra streaming cost yeah
anyway anyway so that's that's my cool
news okay so it's it's costing 30% more
than our one gig switched fiber
connection which was already really
expensive but now the new price that
doesn't actually sound that bad it's not
that bad yeah plus over the three years
we owe them one video which is fine
because like who cares like they're
probably gonna end up getting anyway and
and honestly they would have probably
gotten hopefully they're not watching
they probably would have gotten one
anyway because the whole bonded internet
thing that we did that was like a
commercial product that they had before
they have they acquired the company that
did the software for the bonding rewrote
it
so it's multi-threaded now so you don't
need such an expensive appliance to do
it and they want to this is confidential
well whatever they're gonna have they're
gonna have better products and services
oh crap I hope I just didn't get in a
lot of trouble well whatever they're
cool guys why don't we just say that and
with cool stuff so we probably made a
video anyway
we go up great topics for you guys today
Oh ex yeah everybody talked about it we
haven't yet really 9:10 intel chips hmm
yeah this is cool steam compatibility
tools so you can play more games on on
Linux and that 10 series GTX cards are
on sale also this intro you can watch it
now
No
how much would people pay to see
like - versus Austin cage fighters Oh
God oh I mean I'm so interested right
now the difference is but Austin such a
nice person I don't do it he's actually
just so nice I don't know I'm so
interested though because he's
ridiculously fit and well yeah all the
time he's super fit um but I don't I
don't think he's like actually trained
for fighting them yeah but and you are
that would be a pretty distinct
advantage of would like I actually at
our weight class I really don't think
him being more fit is gonna be very
helpful but it's an interesting thank
you it's still an interesting comparison
a benchmark just to be clear guys no -
and Hostin are not boxing that will that
is not a thing we're doing although if
he was down like not like not like
 MMA no not like MMA like friggin
bare-knuckle or anything like that but
like but the Bark's box it could be
interesting especially because I've
never boxed before okay so but like I
know how do you know pretty much most
basic I know how to punch I know how to
dodge I know how to block like I could
probably put two and two together
especially against another amateur but
tell you what tell you what if Austin's
down I'll box Austin so for the context
of people are wondering Logan Paul and
chaos are fighting tomorrow I think I
think it's tomorrow is that real
what really that's amazing yeah that's
ridiculous
yeah I've been training for a while some
journal dude did a video on how hard
they're punching so I watched that
because it wouldn't give either them
views and I'll tell you this ksi has way
better form and
clearly knows what he's doing a lot
better than Logan but then Logan is a
mountain so we'll see
Logan has much longer reach is this as
much like a pay-per-view thing or is
this just my view on YouTube yeah yeah
it's kind of interesting they're gonna
hate watch it watch the crap on it so
that they see each of them or one of
them individually get hit in the face
that's like ABS that is the entire show
see that's what I think I think you're
if goodness I don't think that's going
to be a thing but if you in Austin are a
thing there's no way and I'm I am joking
but it it wouldn't have the allure of
the like the hate it would be a friendly
yeah it would be clearly a friendly
battle and I can't think I'm sure
there's some but I can't think of anyone
who actively wants to see you guys hit
me I don't think I could punch Austin
you know I've actually I've actually I
shouldn't say it's complicated but I
don't really I don't really count the
only time that I've ever fought with
someone like I I've never really been in
a fight no no I'm I'm of I'm a pretty
I'm a pretty passive like turn the other
cheek don't last very long
right when you don't have gloves and
like a helmet thingy I guess that's true
they like really someone gets hit a
couple times and they're like wow this
is nice you know what's really crazy the
the guys so we have a video coming soon
once again I hope I'm not revealing too
much about my hair is it look
spectacular ly bad good no good we're
gonna embrace it yeah I'm just gonna
have like gamer hair today
um so we have a sponsored video coming
up on deep spar you ever heard of deep
spark yeah but I don't know what about
it but I've heard of it so deep spar is
a data recovery company that is not like
you send your hard drive there and they
recover your data they actually build
tools for data recovery companies anyway
so they sponsor the video we're gonna
have that coming out pretty soon it's on
floatplane already and
the guy the the the son of the CEO who
also access like kind of an Operations
Manager like he's an executive there
okay we're going to lunch and I'm like
so like what are your hobbies and he's
like oh like bare-knuckle MMA fighting
and I'm like really okay and he's like
oh yeah love it and I'm like so
basically you're in Fight Club and he's
like pretty much and he starts to like
pull back some of his clothes and he
starts showing me like some of the
bruises that are on him like right now
meanwhile the guys like dressed in
business casual because he's like at
work and I'm just I'm looking at this
going like I don't think I'm gonna put a
toe out of line and I think they better
deliver a really good video for these
guys he's like explaining to me how he
has no feeling left in his shins ya know
that well that's a goal you want that
yeah he's like yeah like here here like
I did like I don't even feel anything he
starts like hitting it I'm like stop
yeah it's fine I believe he did that on
purpose to get to that point right
microfractures
yeah so so that that's a thing that's
not me I don't have that killer instinct
unfortunately my left hip your left hip
yeah same situation really yeah cuz in
in football and rugby basically my right
side was always my more accurate and
stronger side uh-huh
so whenever I would hit people I would
lead on left every single time out hit
someone I would throw a little bit more
than my left wasn't really supposed to
but my whole idea was like if it gets a
little hurt I can stay in because
everything that matters is on my right
side so yeah my left hip is like mostly
numb I don't really feel anything there
uh-huh random yeah so if I ever actually
did have to fight you for some reason go
for the right probably yeah generally
with like everything my right side is
just generally less and then die someone
laughs rugby in Canada yeah it was uh it
was definitely the worst team I was on
I'll give you that foot we were not good
I don't necessarily particularly
remember ever winning but we might've
there was a pretty like there was a
pretty good rugby rugby program at my
high school actually my high school no I
there was the only thing we had there
was so yeah there dove schools that are
like that yeah and there was like one or
two schools that we went against that
we're pretty good but it was not like it
was not super common right and our
school was definitely not good cool at
all all right so why don't we jump right
into Intel ninth gen ships on pre-order
for pre-order on a Dutch site so this
was originally posted by tweakers dotnet
it was posted our original articles from
tweakers net and it was supposed to by
Robby on the forum and if if the rumors
are going the way they have been so far
it will be set on stage that they're not
true and then immediately after he said
after they said that they'll be 100%
accurate yeah exactly
also there's not a whole lot of useful
information here I mean the top the top
chip the 9900 Kay is listed 833 euros I
really don't think that's very likely I
wouldn't be surprised if we saw a slight
price hike over the 8700 K but I don't I
don't see it going even if it is in that
euro range the products are usually more
expensive in euros anyways the more
interesting part of the rumors is that
it seems to be a confirmation that we're
going to see Intel's Core i3 i5 i7 thing
is about to get even more confusing
because we're gonna have a core i7 that
doesn't have hyper threading oh boy yeah
so it looks like three models 9600 K so
that's a six core six thread we're gonna
have a 9700 K that's a core i7 so that's
eight cores eight threads and then we're
gonna have a core I own oh it will be an
i-9 oh my goodness
okay and then we're gonna have enough
for I nine on the mainstream platform
that is eight through eight core 16
threads what are they doing why are they
making
did I miss something what's up with the
plus 2 so plus means
with obtain support Oh I've actually
been meaning to do a video about that
like wTF is core i7 + yeah basically
it's a core i7 and also you put octane
in your computer okay yeah no that's
like that's that's it
I mean I thing to put on the plus I
understand what they're doing because
you can't really differentiate on CPU
performance anymore so you might as well
differentiate on the overall benefits of
your platform what's that I don't know
why I'm drawing a blank on this because
I think it's super cool and talking
about it relatively often but the like
GPU compute thing that people use for
video encoding yeah I think that if it
was plus and that meant quick sync
yeah I would honestly make more sense to
me yeah but then that would be bad for
them yeah because they never I 9 + on
the mainstream platform and no core idea
speaking of Intel and their GPUs we
actually screwed something up when we
did our Larrabee video actually no I'm
not gonna move on to that yet because I
wanted to talk about core i3 versus i-5
versus i7 are we just skipping this
Intel well people keep complaining that
we haven't talked about it so naturally
my reaction to that is to troll them by
it's completely avoiding it yeah yeah um
this this is why Intel you shouldn't
make this branding any more confusing
9.5 this is the second most watched
video that linus media group has ever
made what the heck is core i3 i5 or i7
at 9.5 million views melting screen
prank isn't there I just want to know I
checked I checked the other day you're
not there it's close melting screen
prank is number 3 I think yeah why does
it keep going up it's still doing really
well every time I check it it's up like
a million views core I and core i9 isn't
generating any less confusion because
that was four years ago with nine and a
half million views and this is a year
and a year ago with two million views
and remember the core i9 is such a one
percenter product anyway yeah that
literally all
them watched it notice just that a huge
amount of people watch it because they
were like what should I care I bet as
many people watch this video as have
bought Cora nines total ever and that's
a problem when you have to do that much
education for you with your consumers
sorry what was I gonna talk about before
how remember important we're dodging
r-tx it seemed important now there was
there was another thing that I was we
were talking about how the some of them
don't have hyper-threading when it seems
like they should the plus thing is super
weird so we have to make another video
last thing is dumb oh you were gonna
make a video about the plus oh yeah yeah
that that's basically it we just wanted
to do a video kind of like charting on
it because we think it's pretty dumb
yeah like we don't think obtained is
done
I actually we've done sponsored suffer
obtained this isn't it obtained tech is
cool yeah
definitely cool oh wow you know what
just occurred to me with that pipe in
here we could also experiment with
server configs that we can't necessarily
buy or rent at existing data centers
like we could build something totally
custom throw it in and see what happens
what do you mean like if we wanted to
experiment with something like god oh
yeah yeah definitely that would be cool
yeah okay anyway sorry I just think AJ's
would geek the freakin hell out over
that I think I think so too because I've
actually got a project upcoming six
workstations one CPU I was streaming
about that today yeah and I might be
able to get a hook up on some op tain
drives for that and then once that's
done I could rip them out we could throw
them in a server and just would you more
see what happens
ltte videos about that I think so
potentially sure that seems interesting
yeah I don't see why no I would be
interested and like I don't necessarily
care if you know what like what our
experimental server in the lmg office is
whatever I don't think it matters
oh no you can see the videos you're
paying to see
good heavens all right what else what
else we got today actually this is a
really big topic so why don't we do the
Nvidia thing first I guess sure so this
was posted by Ratan man on the forum we
will finally acknowledge it the original
sources I don't know everywhere
everyone's talking about it
d-force r-tx yeah nvidia has new cards
they're sold out everywhere the brand
did you know that they're legit sold out
everywhere really you can't buy them
anymore they're all out now a bunch of
people were like oh oh like you can
solve the the availability problems by
like crank and the price saying video
you thought about that huh huh huh and
then boom sold out almost immediately
there's people like angry that they
can't buy them like it's really yeah but
they don't even know what the
performance is yet no one seems to care
it's a great world isn't it really is
like there's less performance metrics
and there was on the Pascal launch
there's basically not even the Pascal
watch like they had more direct
performance metrics they were like it
compares this weird abstracted number
better in this game but like SMP based
and that was the weird with every
generation invidious hubris grows but
the thing about hubris is that it's
supposed to like cause some kind of
downfall and I don't foresee that as
long as people keep giving them money
for stuff that's completely site on sale
where and like I think I think the the
prediction from last win even if it
doesn't end up being completely true
yeah it's gonna be more true than is
kind of comfortable because I really
don't think there's gonna be a huge
performance increase I think it's a
feature thing yeah that's what it looks
like as ray-tracing does seem super cool
it's gonna be faster GDD are six is
faster and I'm sure they haven't been
completely sitting on ass for the last
two years so obviously it's gonna be a
bit faster but I don't think the FPS
increases are the story here is the
story here where's the thing that makes
me uncomfortable a lot of the
ray-tracing demos that we've seen so far
running at like 45 frames per second one
of them and I'm kind of looking at it
going ah 30 to 45 to be clear 245 was on
the high end
reader when was the last time you felt
like lighting was the issue for in-game
realism okay so I will answer this in
two different ways one is more direct to
the question and one of them is a little
bit more as Jack did sure basically
never for the first one yeah
but finally really really good
applications of lighting have definitely
helped with realism and there is
examples of like holy cow with the right
lighting that really helps get you out
of the valley the uncanny valley thing
is what I'm talking about I can
understand the benefits to it but it is
extremely a like if we're talking about
gaming it's extremely a single-player
focused thing because you're playing
anything multiplayer you're gonna want
to turn that the heck off yeah cuz for
me like I I I have always been far more
I've always found poor facial animations
yeah or they're for low resolution
textures or just poorly done graphics in
general yeah or just us lazy or sloppy
set deck is what we call it in
production I don't know what they call
it in gaming but just like the the the
clutter in a room when you walk into it
like seeing that same clock model reused
a lot like that kind of stuff is far
more jarring to me than the bounces of
the light rays as they move around a
scene someone in chat said lol lighting
ray tracing isn't just about well it's
x47 i'll give you a call it isn't just
about lighting for games the most
important thing will be reflections that
can show objects that are behind a
perspective camera wow that's niche he
didn't have the wow that's in each part
I threw that in there is a little flavor
text also reflections or lighting I okay
I think the tech is actually really cool
and I was talking to had a buddy over
here who I told you about him I met him
in Sweden he gave me the two
particle accelerator labs and the laser
labs and stuff he's really excited about
it from like scientific applications yes
because those cores are gonna be super
helpful yes and like he's stoked also
they might actually be willing to do
videos at that place now that would be
amazing
yeah okay we'll take that offline yeah
okay and it's still very unsure and
stuff but I'll get you more info later
sure but like he's really stoked and
that's really cool and that lines up
with the story that NVIDIA has been
giving us for quite a few years now
which is where like AI stuff is
important science is important we're
doing the deep learning stuff we're
doing buh buh buh buh buh they've been
trooping for this for a very long time
wish I owned Nvidia stock yep it it
meant yes exactly it makes sense in
their in their path that they've been
taking it's all very logical the fact
that the performance jump probably isn't
going to be that huge but they have this
really cool ray tracing stuff and they
have the new cores and all that kind of
stuff that's all very cool basically
NVIDIA has gone from making gaming GPUs
that they adapt to workstations and
professional uses to making professional
GPUs and then trickling the features
down to gaming somehow and I think that
is reflected in the fact that the 1080
Ti is basically a Titan which has been
more or less accepted by most people yes
so anyway the price is that these cards
have sold out at the founders Edition 20
atti is 1200 us the founders Edition
2080 is 800 us and the founders Edition
2070 is 600 so the best news I think
coming out of all of this given that
anytime like I've uh
so here's the other problem when Nvidia
launched the 1080 it was all about this
voxel based illumination and stuff like
I said that was all they wanted to talk
about are there any games that used it
SMP some timmy's multi projection that
would that was actually the biggest
thing that they were pushing was that
the big thing yes of simultaneous
multi-project and games use that but it
was VR the voxel thing yeah
illumination I'm pretty sure ya GI
that's what they called it ya voxel
global illumination VX GI x GI game so
there's a epic games demo from 2015
Unreal Engine 4.19 Nvidia the XG I flow
blast so here's my problem anytime we
get a fundamental shift in the way that
games are rendered the first generation
card that supports it by the time any
games launch any demanding Triple A
grade games launch that use it is not
gonna perform well enough for the way
it's meant to be played experience
that's my problem every time we get a
card that is sold based on a feature
whether that feature is tessellation or
whether it's DirectX 12 or whether it's
VX GI you go back again and again and
again and again and there's the selling
feature and then that's when you have
hardware so game developers can actually
start working on the bloody thing and
then there's the next card or the one
after that
that actually does it well enough that
you can get a great gaming experience
with it that's my concern about ray
tracing with these new cards is that yes
they will support it but when we
actually get games that do a fantastic
job once the game developers fully
understand this technology and know how
to use it it's probably not gonna be
able to keep up but I could be wrong and
I mean frankly for me if we don't see
any improvement in anything other than
lighting if ray tracing is the only
thing that that the game engine makers
work on over the next couple of years
and they find a way to make me totally
wrong because the games will basically
run the same way that they run now
except will be fully utilizing this ray
tracing additional hardware yeah then
then great but I don't know I don't know
if I've yet seen something that has
broken that pattern can you yeah well ok
to again it's my first card that
supported physics by the time anything
really implemented physics properly did
it run well no I do fully believe the
bigger push for Pascal was SNP and
looking up SNP game is going to be
because he is a like a VR thing and it's
like a suite of things yeah well and you
can use it different ways so there's
games that weren't really VR base that
used parts of it to write do things but
really there wasn't a ton of titles that
utilize SMP right as far as I know okay
you're taking short-term that is exactly
what we're doing that's exactly what
we're doing you spend your money you're
actually buying a thing to actually use
especially when you're buying like
emerging technologies yeah and like
here's to here's the thing is that it's
kind of funny because it's one of those
situations where the more affluent you
are almost the more likely you are when
the next one comes out that can actually
run it well the more likely you are to
just be able to buy that too so if you
can afford a 20 80 TI now then you could
probably afford to just run your 10 80
TI that you probably have until a 38 UTI
comes out that'll actually right like by
the time some games come out that can
actually utilize it you could probably
just buy that that's my point
it's almost like the more money you have
the less it makes sense to waste it
whereas if you were someone who had to
scrimp and save in order to get a 20 80
TI well then you're probably getting a
big upgrade because you're probably
renting something that's a lot slower so
you're probably also getting additional
performance you're on like six or seven
hundred series
I guess that's that's kind of the point
like if you're someone who upgrades
every three or four years by all means
go out and buy a 2000 series have fun
because you're gonna be getting a great
upgrade across the board it's just until
I see it I'm gonna have a hard time
believing that based on this feature
this upgrade makes a ton of sense for
someone that has a modern card unless
again I've been wrong before buddy we
don't have performance benchmarks yeah
yeah I don't have a card yeah so I'm
just talking out of my butt yeah who
knows the fact that everyone's
pre-ordered this already yeah and every
generation of cards Nvidia just kind of
takes even more control over the the
messaging like they've they've announced
the cards they've put them on sale and
we still be the independent
Media knows absolutely nothing other
than what we've had leaked by invidious
partners or what they said on a stage
yeah dang yeah I'm like obviously and
I'm sure some people are thinking this
no one's really said if Venus there is
benefit to us to say wait for
performance benchmarks yeah sure sure of
course yeah but there's also a huge
benefit do you know no fake news you can
use media and not even just us you
should like watch our video when it
comes out check out our performance
benchmarks and then look at like a lot
of other people's yeah yeah go check out
go check out shroud go check out a non
tech I'm sure Ryan will do some stuff
like by all means like it's like doing a
little mix of like the video people and
the written people that's good
aidan games 1250 thank you very much for
the reminder
Adam games 1250 says sponsors don't
forget your sponsors thanks thank you
why don't we start with a relatively new
sponsors are sort of new there are new
in the sense that they're new right now
we haven't worked with them in a while
shade tree sunglasses are handmade from
premium wood materials this is the
hazelnut helpfully labeled by John oh no
nice yeah this is the ponderosa Rosa
ponderosa so this is I saw these on the
shelf I thought it was t know these are
sunglasses so they're had made some
premium wood materials they use a
polarized lens that blocks a hundred
percent of the UV rays from the Sun
they've got two new styles that you can
smell us like wood I mean I guess shut
up
anyway the two new styles called
Ponderosa and hazelnut those are dark
this one ponderosa is made from a black
walnut with titanium hinges and the
hazelnut is made from solid evidence
eyes for people with smaller faces
that's your problem this one was for me
if it's a lot better alright so grab
yourself a pair today and use offer code
line is to get 10% off through the link
below o polarized lenses
I was like wow these are so dark I can
barely see that yeah yeah but so people
are wondering why we're doing this yeah
if you if you look at it like straight
on it's basically black yeah if there
was any doubt that the polarization was
working yeah let me put that to rest
it's very clearly work that's very very
working interesting so this monitor is
polarized the other way yeah
compared to my laptop oh and yours too
anyway very interesting ah
we also have a couple other sponsors
today first up is madrenas copy
ah
madrenas coffee is coffee for fuel big
cans a cold brew coffee with a flavor
for everyone from sweet and creamy
flavors like mocha or caramel to bold
and roasty flavors like cold brew black
and dark roast
they are delicious specialty grade
blends of cold brew coffee that is very
redundant thank you Colten guys and they
come in a convenient ready to drink
16-ounce can from now until August 31st
you can get 50% off your madrenas coffee
order with discount code Linus all caps
the first 50 people to use the code will
also get a free bag of micro roasts
automatically added to their order mmm
what so go to madrenas coffee dot-com /
Linus which I will put up there now haha
to get 50% off that's crazy
for those of you drink hot coffee by the
way they just launched three new micro
roasts two dragons side quest and Double
Diamond and they're now available on the
website oh by the way they're slow-mo is
in the chat if you have any questions
about madrenas yeah finally always
hopeful I have never tried their hot
sauce holy crap this is a reaper hot
sauce is now actually the time
how many Reapers would it take to make a
jar of our bottle of hot sauce this big
how terrifying is that
yeah that's pretty terrifying are you
gonna do it ingredients Tomatoes
Carolina Reaper peppers it's the second
habanero peppers apple cider vinegar
honey lime juice
like onions kosher salt light brown
sugar and ground mustard that actually
sounds delicious
that does sound delicious it also sounds
like Carolina Reapers and all that can
ingredient it also sounds savage savage
jerky oh boy made from the best
ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives with the goal of creating
a snack that is full of flavor and spice
but that isn't bad for you
he's taking the see we've got 13
different flavors of jerky like the
sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon
maple buffalo Bacon's my personal
favorite they also make barbecue sauce
hot sauce and a spice rub one of their
hot sauces is made from Carolina Reaper
peppers one of the hottest peppers in
the world and you can use offer code LTT
to save 10% on all their products I I'm
just gonna try a little bit because I I
think I think why would you move right
then there's hot sauce all over my
laptop that's a lot I'm gonna die hold
on how much do you have I wasn't
preacher that's more what happened I
don't know no I was looking when I was
pouring the other one where's the lid if
I get on you yeah it's all over my pants
mmm hot pants that's spicy
what just happened
oh did someone just turn off all the
filming lights thank you
I think they're working on it okay who
has more do you have the same amounts
pretty similar
I might have slightly less but my finger
is bigger okay you've got some wrapped
around me aware that you okay all right
yeah I think we're good at okay I
actually really don't want to do this
okay oh I can already feel Wow
[Laughter]
Oh ed could I get a paper towel I
spilled hot sauce on my laptop I need
something away but always you want a
huge variety of girls jerky I'm crying
so much right now
thank you my eyes are fine I'll try to
prove that oh no I got them tears yeah
but I
so my oh my chest has already not felt
very good today I'm man enough to cry oh
maybe this will clear me up you know
well once you get like if I wasn't just
and drinking it like I I actually I love
hot sauce on my like marinara yes that
yeah yeah yeah like putting that in like
a pasta or something that's it's really
nice if the flavors are really good it's
got some lime to it like yes that is
actually a really delicious hot sauce
got a nice acidity
I wouldn't recommend just drinking it
yeah nice okay well there you go I'm
actually I'm gonna take that home one
thing I noticed about that was the
immediacy of it some of them there's
like a bit of a delay that hits you
right away
Oh straight to the vein alright alright
anyway do we have any more like tech
news topics we wanted to talk about here
okay Wow oh yeah
steam compatibility tool yeah oh do you
want to do the kalashnikov electric car
first that's amazing we want to do that
first no let's do it first let's do it
first
okay so Kalashnikov
yes that Kalashnikov I always thought it
was kalishnikov but it's like it's not
it's like clearly not spelled that way
so did I
it actually looks really cool it
actually looks really cool like that
really like kind of like like hipstery
like like modern but with classic
inspiration like I'm not really a car
guy like it's clearly old-school but
then the the rims and the lights and the
good rail like that would turn my head
yeah oh yeah yeah yeah it looks great
for sure in style
most cool modern cars yeah it's hard to
see them ever being classic yep yes this
has a really iconic looking design it's
really different really different from
anything else so Russian weapons
manufacturer
Kalashnikov best known for making the
ak-47 has unveiled a fleet of electric
and hybrid cars buggies and motorcycles
these guys went all out
I guess them falling weapons rifle sales
in the US might be prompting this you
know about that right
no I didn't know yeah so it's
interesting for the gun companies
Democratic leadership has actually been
better for their sales because people
run out so that makes them buy a bunch
of guns Wow just in case so they'll get
grandfathered in in case a bunch of anti
gun protection yep
anyway so this includes an electric
vehicle that the company claims will
rival Tesla well when Tesla makes all
this stuff open-source it kind of makes
it it's a concept car dubbed the C v1
and bears a close resemblance to the
Soviet era Trabant see I'm not actually
like I'm not a car guy so I'm not that
let's have a let's have a look at that I
don't know how to pronounce it but I've
seen it before for sure
I'm Austin mini-documentary on it okay
yeah it does kind of there's clearly a
lot of difficulty powers wait what hold
on a second is this the car that what is
this from I thought you drove a British
car no it can't be
there's no way he's driving like a
Soviet car that can't be right anyway it
just it looks like the parking lot of
the Fawlty Towers Hotel from the show
it's not is it anyway whatever so that's
the cards based on looks really cool
let's have a look here so the CV one is
based on the Trabant was a late East
German car yeah okay East German car not
a starch plastic there you go so it's
based on the retro eyes NH 22 21 252 and
that's known as the combien it's a test
bed for Kalashnikovs electric drivetrain
so the company said they developed it
in-house it's got a cruising range of
350 clicks zero to 100 kilometers Erie
264 our American friends in roughly six
seconds and 90 kilowatt hours our
battery capacity of 90 kilowatts per
hour I think that means 90 kilo watt
hours I think that's just a typo in our
notes yeah would you buy a kalashnikov
car okay so with what I know about their
most famous rifle not necessarily their
other productions but yeah famous rifle
yeah because the idea is that it just
always works so it does that I don't
know if that goes into their other forms
of engineering in a lot of ways electric
vehicles are less complex than an
internal combustion engine even though
they're actually it's funny I was about
to say they're newer tech they're not
electric cars actually came first if you
go back far enough but the the modern
electric cars are definitely newer tech
than the very refined internal
combustion is that we have today but in
a lot of ways they're a lot simpler so
it shouldn't be that big of a surprise
that we're seeing like almost like a
land grab like gold rush style I don't
know what would you call it like our
Renaissance like yeah well like you're
seeing a lot of brands pop out of the
woodwork with electric cars electric
motorcycles just complete nobodies
mostly most of the traditional car
companies are stepping in as well but
there is a lot of random new company
stepping up and making electric cars
yeah I mean even that bike that I want
to go down and test drive which I will
be doing I have a trip to San Fran
confirmed so how's he doing that did I
talk about that when she left me yegor
Kozyrev says PSBs fully
belt out you knave Canadians don't
understand anything in Russia is
proposed for corruption not for making
final product it sounds a little
aggressive so nothing in Russia will be
produced I'm also starting to question
his username because he's like it sounds
like he's trashing Russia but he's
something has a super Russian user name
so he might actually be like playing
that angle says you won't get one yeah I
don't actually expect Kalashnikov to
necessarily make a push into the US yeah
but that doesn't mean that no one will
ever own one we'll see if they make them
alright this is huge news this week this
was posted by PIP Neenah on the forum
and it is the steam compatibility tool
so the original article here is actually
steam the steam community boom steam for
Linux introducing a new version of steam
play so it looks like they have not
given up on gaming for Linux even though
steam OS kind of died on the vine rather
they've released a beta is probably fine
of a new and improved version of steam
play - all Linux users it includes a
modified distribution of wine called
proton so wine is wine is not an
emulator it's a way to play Windows
games on Steam called proton to provide
compatibility with Windows game titles
here are some of the improvements it
brings to the table Windows games with
no Linux version currently available can
now be installed and run directly from
the Linux steam client complete with
native Steamworks and open VR support
Wow
DirectX 11 and 12 implementations are
now based on Vulcan resulting in
improved game compatibility and reduced
performance impact full screen support
has been improved full springs full
screen games will be seamlessly
stretched to the desired display without
interfering with the native monitor
resolution or requiring the use of a
virtual desktop improved game controller
support they will automatically
recognize all controllers supported by
Steam that's very cool and expect more
out-of-the-box controller compatibility
then even the original version of the
game performance from multi-threaded
games has been greatly improved compared
to vanilla wine Wow so the initial set
of supported games with the beta release
is the second one is the most important
beat sabre bejeweled 2 deluxe dokie
literature club doomed doomed to hell on
earth doom VFR fallout shelter fate
final fantasy 6 really oh wow
I am gonna go get that and play it on
Linux just for lulz geometry - Google
Earth VR into the breach Magic the
Gathering a bunch of other Magic the
Gathering mountain blade mount blade
with fire and sword near payday quake
stalker shadow Chernobyl Star Wars
Battlefront - Tekken 7 The Last Remnant
replica for ultimate doom Warhammer 4000
dawn of war dark crusade some other
Warhammer thing and users are also able
to try playing non whitelisted games
using an override switch in the steam
clan and apparently a ton of stuff is
working going forward users can vote on
their favorite games to be considered
for Steam play using platform wish
listing and presumably they will like
work on that Wow very cool very very
very cool proton contains a custom
version of wine as well as additional
libraries developed alongside it is
fully open source and available right
now on github this could change
everything
especially if they keep progressing
especially if they like actually stick
with it mind you valve has shown
considerable resilience when it comes to
decoupling themselves from Microsoft and
Windows even if the particular projects
that they've worked on have not
necessarily developed much like I don't
think they've done anything with steam
link since the original one yeah not
that I'm aware of anyway but I think
like when you look at steam link steam
controller and the steam OS steam box
kind of deal that situation none of that
really was enough to pull people away
yes yes so maybe this will be I
definitely know some people I I don't
know anyone who's going to switch to
Linux because of this but I definitely
know some people that were already using
Linux already trying to game it on Linux
that are super excited because of it if
that makes sense what's going on this
was an actual topic in the dock yeah I
had no idea this was a topic yeah
who should line his fight on page I
thought we were just like dicking around
no the biggest event in internet history
I've focused pads this becomes a thing
we can train I know I know like the
basics of
boxing training now because I've started
I'm not fighting Austin that's no no I
don't think you should fight awesome but
if you do fight someone I just think
it's too nice you don't think I'm too
nice
wow-wow-wow dick you don't think I'm too
nice to punch someone have you ever seen
me look like I was close to punching
someone no but I think you could
actually yes I think I have when on the
couch at my parents house what happened
there
scrap headboard season for what happened
in the season four remember okay the
power went out that day we had to move
the entire operation for the end of
season four it's got Brad where's my
parents house cuz they still had power
yeah and then we had to film scuppered
wars and a channel super fun there and
because of we had a room arrangement
planned here and because we couldn't do
it here we had to sit in the family room
of my parents house while everyone else
was in the garage and they had to film
it on their cell phones and hangouts to
us and basically everyone was like doing
oh I was mad but I couldn't have punched
anyone no no no but I think you could
have punched someone I could have
punched something but not something I
was mad enough to punch something but I
definitely wouldn't have hit anyone that
was there no no no those are my friends
I would I would never punch a friend
like that it couldn't be a thing it's
also illegal yeah but if you're in like
a ring and it's measured I think you can
hit some all right well on that note my
battery is dead on my laptop so the wind
show's over thanks for watching guys see
you again next week same bat-time same
bat-channel
Jeremiah says I imagine - and Austin
fighting like Mandark and Dexter
they like kind of slap each other with
their gloved hands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
