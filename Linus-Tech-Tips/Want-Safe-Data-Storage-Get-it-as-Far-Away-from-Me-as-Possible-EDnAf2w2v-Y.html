make for quite some time because I've
been meaning to practice what I preach
for quite some time and that is to
always have a backup of your data
preferably one that is off-site which is
easier to say them to do I mean if
you've just got a few smartphone
pictures you can use a cloud account or
even burn a couple disks once a quarter
to act as your disaster recovery storage
solution but if you're talking about
dozens of terabytes worth of video and
we're talking video that could be needed
at any given moment for smooth business
operation you better have something a
little beefier so meet Kamloops server
whether you run a small business or a 1
billion dollar enterprise Rackspace has
your dedicated storage environment
covered check out the link in the video
description to learn more so this
project starts actually with undoing
most of what I had planned from before I
had intended to use the same Norco RPC
4224 case from the high speed SSD server
which can handle 24 drives on sleds with
a SATA or SAS compatible backplane thing
but I star USA reached out and showed me
this the ex4 m36 - exp and my plans
changed somewhat at that time so at the
front of this case you'll find a 24
hot-swappable hard drive caddies that
work with three and a half or two and a
half inch drives some sick-ass beefy 120
millimeter cooling fans and this SAS
backplane that connects on the inside
with the usual molex power connectors
and SFF 8087 SAS connectors with the
difference and this is cool being that
it doesn't actually require six SAS
connectors for all those 24 drives you
can even use just one if you want and
the backplane handles routing that
traffic to all the connected drives now
obviously with just that one connector
you won't necessarily be able to run all
of those bays at the same speed as if
they were individually plugged in but
for an off-site backup server well where
we'll never do more than gigabit speed
to the whole box this is way more than
enough but hold on a second line is
since when is more than enough enough I
thought this is Linus tech gets why
aren't you sticking with the Norco case
that drives every single connected drive
individually at full speed great
question and we can answer it by going
around the back of the ex4 m36 ESP yes
friends that is another 12 drives back
there giving us a total of 36 drives of
expansion that thanks to the built-in
gasps expander boards can be driven off
of just two SF 8087 ports absolutely
perfect
for an unread deployment which doesn't
mean that there aren't any compromises
that we're making with a configuration
like this I mean I get effectively only
a 2u height enclosure inside my for you
case to install all the rest of my
internal components so let's meet those
internal components shall we
first is our motherboard as e9p au8
server board - masseuse with a couple of
features that make it ideal for this
build number one is the IPMI intelligent
platform management interface module
that we've added to it when you can't
have physical access to a server because
it's a six-hour drive away one of these
is critical because it allows you to
perform low-level functions through a
dedicated special Ethernet port on the
back that normally couldn't be done
through conventional network control
solutions like TeamViewer or remote
desktop connection things like altering
BIOS settings or hard resetting the
machine number two is that it's
compatible with some hardware that we
had lying around like these for 16 gig
ECC ddr3 kingston ram modules that I've
actually had chicken about the office
since uh kingston sponsorship deal for
that whole room water cooling project
over a year ago and this xeon e5 26:20
v2 six core that i pulled out of our
store inator server when i needed a
higher clock cpu to overcome some SMB
bottlenecking so i could have tried to
source a better cpu in this case because
while 64 gigabytes does give me the
option to run some of the ends I suspect
this machine won't do much more than
store files so I kept things pretty
light for cooling I obviously couldn't
stick with my go to server heat sink the
Noctua NHD 9 l because of the limited
height that I had to work with so I
opted for an NH L 12 with the top 120
millimeter fan removed and since this is
only an 80 watt TDP chip with Apple case
airflow it's not really a concern to
just
that bottom fan on there next is our HP
a cardan I've actually been using raid
cards many of which I had lying around
already so it wasn't a matter of extra
cost for HPA or host bus adapter duty
but what I found out relatively recently
is that even ones with good J baud mode
so that's just kind of like an HPA mode
where you just connect drives and they
show up to windows like they're just a
drive no raid they don't behave
completely transparently which can
interfere with operating systems like
FreeNAS and on rain getting proper smart
data readings from the drives so I'm
actually using an LSI 9300 8 HPA so it
has zero raid capabilities whatsoever
then I've got a couple of mini SAS HD
connectors that I can use adapter cables
to plug into my back planes leading us
finally two hard drives yes my friends
the 8 terabyte Seagate enterprise
capacity drives are making yet another
appearance here in all of their glory
these are only SATA drives but for our
workload it really won't make any
difference and SAS controllers are
compatible with SATA drives just not the
other way around which you can learn
more about here so these are true
enterprise-grade drives not the shingled
archival ones and they're capable of
their full read and write speed so
somewhere in the neighborhood of 230 to
240 megabytes per second according to
some write speed testing that we did
when you're just hitting one drive at a
time freaking awesome they also offer
excellent resistance to vibrations from
nearby machines a must for data center
deployment and a massive 2 million our
mean time between failure rating with
all of them installed then so that's we
actually had only 23 left after the ones
we've deployed already all that's left
to find out is how much performance we
can get with so many drives hooked up to
a single connector and actually that is
looking pretty darn good thanks to the
12 gigabit per second SAS controller
we're using and the rated internal
bandwidth of about 2.4 gigabytes per
second for that SAS back clean at the
front we could write to our array of 22
disks at about 2 gigabytes per second
then we'll need even if we upgrade it to
ten gigabit internet since this server
will be off-site freakin ballin
speaking of ballin were you thinking you
might want a solution that's a little
bit less hands-on than this
well there's Rackspace it's the top tier
manage cloud computing company may pride
themselves on best-in-class service
across all platforms they've got over
three hundred thousand customers in a
hundred and twenty countries with ten
worldwide data centers whether you run a
small business or a billion dollar
enterprise you probably have needs for
capacity so that is to say magnetic hard
drives or flash based that is a high
performance storage and I can guarantee
you they have some kind of a solution to
meet your performance security network
capacity and compliance needs I mean
they can handle anything
Dazz so that's directly attached storage
so it's great for like entry-level
redundant arrays they've got fan so
that's high availability and reliability
fully redundant storage that's actually
outside of the machine like elsewhere in
the data center but with super
high-speed links there's Nazz with
support for very demanding workloads for
example virtualization and scalability
up to 20 petabytes of capacity seriously
go do the napkin math how much is that
freaking incredible and they've actually
got public cloud and private cloud based
options available as well so you can set
up your own server with a scaleable
private cloud in your data center or
there's and it's supported by Rackspace
and VMware they refer to their 24/7 365
support as fanatical and they offer
industry-leading service level
agreements so the call to action then is
pretty simple Rackspace has your
dedicated environments covered so check
