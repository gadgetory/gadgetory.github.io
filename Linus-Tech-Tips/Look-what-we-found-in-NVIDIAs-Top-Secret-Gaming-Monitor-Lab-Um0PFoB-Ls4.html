has largely kept the promises that it
made five years ago of eliminating
tearing input lag and stutter in
high-end gaming displays but the how of
this technology is something that
they've kept under wraps until now which
is what makes today's video really
really special because Nvidia sponsored
our trip down to Santa Clara today where
we will be the first non Nvidia
personnel to ever see one of their
g-sync optical labs so let's go find out
how you make a gaming monitor shall we
now NVIDIA doesn't actually manufacture
display panels that work is best left to
the experts at Samsung LG Display au
Optronics and the like but inside this
cage behind me is a sample of every
g-sync
monitor that has ever been built and the
thing is there's far more to creating a
great finished gaming display than just
taking whatever panel those guys hand
you slapping it into an enclosure and
calling it a day in fact while the
situation has improved a lot especially
on the desktop
Nvidia still fails over 50% of the
laptop displays that get sensitive for
validation so each one of these assuming
that they don't immediately fail the
more basic checks will get subjected to
over 300 tests some of which take hours
or even multiple days to run so I feel
kind of bad for the text who drew the
short straw for our visit today and had
to shut down you see the issue and
actually the reason that the walls are
all painted black in here is that with
our filming lights on they can't run any
real tests because the results will be
invalid so we're gonna try to get out of
their way real quick here on this bench
then is our first real test here so it's
a pretty simple one on the surface but
it's one that will weed out a surprising
number of variable refresh rate displays
so our GPU here runs a benchmark with
extreme swings in the framerate
which is designed to expose weaknesses
in the t-con or timing controller which
is the part of the panel that takes the
output from the scaler and translates it
into something that the actual drivers
of the TFT matrix can understand now the
results of these failures are usually
quite obvious because if a t-con
experiences a firmware problem for
example causing an overflow condition
it's go to emergency response is
early to blink out parts of the panel or
even the entire thing temporarily to
prevent it from being damaged
apparently they actually had one of
those come through here just the other
day but that doesn't mean that running
these tests is simple for one thing
these kinds of problems can be weird
edge cases I mean that's why the
manufacturer didn't notice them so they
can take a long time to manifest which
is why they run for up to 48 hours
before assigning a pass and for another
just hooking a source up to a bear
notebook LCD is it ordeal and a half so
of course you need a mobile GPU in order
to validate mobile displays but using an
standard desktop test bench would save
you a lot of time so check out this
Frankenstein creation I've actually got
another one right here so this according
to the folks here is a curing mobile GPU
but soldered on to a development board
with just like this cooler just plugs
straight into 12-volt power just friends
at full speed all the time that's why
these things are so loud and then it's
just bristling with diagnostic readouts
and and sort of measurement points and
then there's then there's the really
cool stuff so this right here is our DVI
output or something that's on a daughter
board for some reason and on the back
here this is really cool so these
interfaces back here are designed for
all of the different implementations of
embedded DisplayPort that you might see
from the various panel manufacturers so
they make their own daughter board PCBs
here so they can adapt this weird
development card to run any display that
they want on to our next test though one
of the hardest parts of creating a
variable refresh rate display is
preventing flickering but the thing is
not everyone perceives flicker the same
and even if a flicker isn't visible to
the eye it can still cause fatigue and
headaches so that is where
this test comes in now it doesn't look
like much but the lab techs here can
change this boring gray screen to output
any refresh rate they want then they use
this client instruments k10 a a basic
luminance meter to measure the amplitude
and decibels of any changes in the
output brightness then that is of course
assuming that the panel makes it this
far they use this special box of NVIDIA
zone creation - kind of like a like a
doctor check in your like heartbeat or
something check all the different areas
of the panel to see which one is the
worst and then ensure that even that is
still within spec rounding out panel
selection is a whole battery of other
tests color reproduction color gamut
absolute luminance native contrast ratio
pixel response times your pretty much
name it then we can move into this room
once a panel is validated it can move on
to stage 2 actual display development at
this point things get a lot pickier so
this forty to fifty thousand dollar XY
positioning jib is precise to one tenth
of a millimeter so what they do is they
light up the display so the one that
we're looking at right here is a g-sync
ultimate unit with HDR ten support add
up to 1000 nits peak brightness and then
they take measurements across the entire
surface to ensure that it's uniform it's
pretty frickin intense except that is
just scratching the surface so this
display also features 384 zone full
array back lighting and handling that
evenly is really freakin tricky
in this test nvidia is evaluating each
of the individual LEDs that makes up the
backlight array not just off and at full
force
but at its various steps in between
because you guys gotta understand
they need to account not just for the
drive level of each one of these zones
but even the neighboring light bleed
from other zones around them and then
making matters worse the whole thing has
got to work perfectly at every
brightness level and every refresh rate
huh
so then once the luminance behavior of
the panel is characterized it's either
fantastic out of the box ready to go or
much more likely it needs some work it's
no bloody wonder that these 4k 144 Hertz
HDR displays got delayed right
speaking of delays in this room also
professionally darkened out don't you
love it when like an engineer is given a
problem and told to solve it quickly I
love this anyway in here is one of them
videos be fgd or big format gaming
displays now the process you're seeing
here is nothing special if you've ever
professionally calibrated a display
before basically a signal generator so
this laptop outputs a known value let's
say white or other more different white
or red or something and then a sensor
like this spectroradiometer checks how
close it is to what it's expecting but
what's different about in videos
approach here is that instead of just
calibrating finished displays during the
development process they're jumping in
to make sure that there are no
underlying issues with the technology
that are gonna crop up while operating
in variable refresh rate mode that can't
be corrected because the thing is many
LCD characteristics change when the
refresh rate changes another fun one to
deal with is overdrive so overdrive
basically works like this you've got a
pixel and you want to take it from level
100 to level 200 which might take it
let's say 8 milliseconds natively well
if that's not good enough for the
performance you want with overdrive we
can tell that pixel I want 250 and
because that's a bigger change it's
gonna reach
our actual desired level of 200 faster
so you're basically giving it a bigger
kick so that you might get there in just
it's four or six milliseconds the trick
though is to not go too high or you'll
get too high of a value overshooting the
intended target now here's the thing at
60 Hertz fixed refresh rate this is
relatively simple so the monitor just
has a lookup table built into it of what
it should shoot for in order to have the
value be correct by the next 16.6
millisecond refresh cycle with variable
refresh rate well it has to compensate
how much of an extra kick it's giving
according to how much more or how much
less time it's gonna have to get to the
actual desired value and even driving
the LEDs and the backlight is a
complicated matter so this is the back
of a jisuk ultimate desktop monitor but
the internal guts here are actually
fundamentally similar to the BFG that we
just saw so at its heart is the powerful
g-sync processor that contains much of G
sinks special sauce then around it is
kind of like the the motherboard of a
monitor so this here is something that
the manufacturer of the monitor would
customize depending on what they want
for display connectors USB hubs built-in
audio that sort of thing then finally
there's a third part here so these are
kind of like the wings that make G sync
HDR fly so these driver eye sees right
here take a digital signal from the
g-sync module scaler for what the
luminance level should be for each of
the 384 LEDs that make up the backlight
here
then they output a given DC voltage to
each of the 16 transistors that drive
the current that actually lights up the
individual LED in each zone just the
right amount but like hold on hold on a
second here a Corsair commander
crow can drive dozens of RGB LEDs per
channel with like four wires what is all
of this for well here's the thing at a
hundred and forty-four Hertz you've got
under seven milliseconds per frame and
you have to both determine and write all
384 of those values each frame and add
up to a thousand its peak brightness so
this is not a trivial task like men I
can imagine the meeting where they
decided to build this thing right now
like all right team so we've never built
a TV before so the plan is to build the
most difficult one lol good luck
everyone and brake which leads us
finally to certification now the third
and final stage might not be that
visually interesting but it's arguably
the most important so this is the point
at which Nvidia receives the first
finished units of each display and goes
through that whole ordeal again to
ensure that nothing got lost in
translation and I have to say going
behind the scenes today gave me a much
deeper appreciation for what NVIDIA has
been doing in the display industry the
eagle-eyed among you for example might
have noticed that one of those backlight
driver boards on this prototype has an
Nvidia silkscreen on it while the other
one has something else that's because as
part of developing g-sync ultimate
Nvidia actually created the reference
design for these driver boards since
nobody had ever done a 384 zone 27 inch
panel before now unfortunately I wasn't
able to show you guys everything that I
saw but what I can say is that my
experience today has shown me
definitively that this is far more than
just a rubber-stamping certification fee
operation so then there are three tiers
of g-sync nap g-sync compatible displays
don't go through anything that you saw
today
Vidia performs for variable refresh rate
tests to ensure that they're suitable
for a basic vr gaming experience then
there's G sync and gsync ultimate where
you're getting the deep collaboration
between your graphics card manufacturer
and your display maker with ultimate
also including support for HDR gaming
which as we've discussed in the past
looks pretty freakin sick so that's it
for today guys massive thank you to you

straight-up allowing us a peek behind
the kimono this was absolutely
incredible
