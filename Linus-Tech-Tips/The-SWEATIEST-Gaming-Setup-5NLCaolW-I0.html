much every desk on the market the
traditional sitting desk has all kinds
of ergonomic and posture challenges and
of course encourages a more sedentary
lifestyle and then there's the new-age
standing desk well with the standing
desk you know you stand and there are a
lot of claims being made about how these
might help offset the gigantic cake that
you're apparently eating for lunch and
making matters worse these standing
desks are inordinately expensive in many
cases so we thought leave it to us we've
got the solution for less than a couple
hundred bucks we're gonna build the desk
that forces you to stay in shape
memory express is dedicated to being the
go-to shop for electronics in Canada and
with their uber price beat guarantee
they'll beat any authorized Canadian
retailers price by 10% of the difference
click the link below to learn more so
you want a desk that keeps you fit where
do you start well there are actually
commercially available treadmill desks
but they are freaking expensive so we
set out to make something a bit more
economical now given that many maybe
even most people should probably have a
bike lying around and if they don't you
can get one for pretty cheap on
Craigslist we figured that seemed like a
good place to start but how could we
make sure that the user actually pedaled
on it and didn't just sit on the bike
seat feeling like they were exercising
could we maybe generate the power for
the computer using the bike well that
seemed a bit harsh but what if we took
away their Internet whenever they
stopped pedaling now we're getting
somewhere so we set about creating a
small generator from a bike that could
be used to power the users internet
switch after ordering a bike fitness
trainer an electric motor and a charge
controller from Amazon we were ready to
get started now you might think that we
should put the electric motor directly
onto the flywheel of the fitness trainer
but we need the motor to be spinning at
around 3,000 RPM and we're not going to
be hitting anywhere near that on the
bike so we need to create a gear
reduction from the bike to about two and
a half two inches something like that so
the plan was to use a V belt attached to
the tire and then onto one of these
pulleys which came in from Amazon and
the bore diameter is just totally wrong
and will not fit onto here so now we're
just going to kind of raw dog it and see
what happens the flywheel was removed
from the fitness trainer and the tire
was removed from the rim allowing the
belt to sit directly on the rim the
tires needed to come off Alex's bike
anyway after he ran over some beer
bottles that someone kindly smashed on
the road so that worked out great for
everyone so the plan since
our diecast pulleys aren't going to work
or to laser cut out pieces of wood have
one that fits over this sprocket and
have a couple that go along the shaft
here and sort of screw them all together
and hopefully can transmit the torque
after a little bit of CAD we were ready
to fire the laser fire the laser look if
we can just transmit the torque with
this it's gonna be like done tomorrow
look on a scale of 1 to absolutely
horrendous where would you rate this I
do
okay I'll take up do you think that we
just got someone to sort of hold this
and then we pedaled we could just see if
it's going to work with the wooden
pulley attached and screwed together we
were actually we weren't that hopeful at
this point so that's got a bit of
stickiness
I don't like fits in the groove pretty
well yeah what was called fricken part
of the exercise experience with very
little to lose
we geared up to see if this plan could
work at all we would need to make sure
that we could have the motor spinning at
over 3,000 rpm without the poor wooden
pulley blowing to pieces so we're
getting like 27 volt so clearly we need
this to me mounted better than just me
holding it but after proving that at
least in theory this should work we
needed to make a more permanent mount
for the motor so we need to lift the
motor up about this high so that the
belt doesn't hit on the frame here and
I'm kind of thinking that we might be
best off making a frame so we sort of
put two here and then one across and
that's where the motor actually mounts
it would be nice though if there's some
way for us to tighten it do you have any
ideas
it's not how you're supposed to use
these tools of sketching know about just
camera though editor's note that one
didn't happen you know just realized
this is the dirty prototype why do I
even bother drilling 4 holes you having
just to sandbag that for sure
the electric motor will be connected to
this solar charge controller which will
take the constantly changing voltage out
of the motor and output a nice clean 12
volts from here it will go to this 12
volt inverter which will turn the 12
volts into 120 volt AC so that you could
plug any device into it like a normal
outlet we weren't entirely sure if this
would work since you might need a
battery between the controller and
inverter on there what if this will work
oh my Foley actually it kind of looks
like that I just forgot to put them that
on so if I start pedaling and you press
the button that's on that nothing yeah
we must need a battery in there
Darrin fitness PC your grab dead because
he was over here taking candy stairs for
to actually work we need this battery
here between the solar charger and the
inverter and that basically just allows
the solar charger to actually turn on
and then it does its thing so ed start
pedaling
so when this lights blinking slowly that
means that we're actually getting
charged into the battery and that means
that it's around 24 ish volts or so now
what we need to do is have it so that if
Edie stops pedaling this light turns off
because right now it's just staying on
until the battery drains which is way
too long and it's not nearly as would
you call electric Oni and as we want
because the idea is to punish the user
whenever they stop exercising we needed
to add a relay where did I put that
relay that closes a switch when the user
starts pedaling completing a circuit and
sending power from the battery to the
inverter then immediately opens it
disconnecting the circuit once the user
stops pedaling with the relay added into
the circuit well it was time to see if
it works yes aha and then if I stop yes
aha I don't want to call it a success
but it is a definitely a prototype that
works I learned so much about
electronics today with v1 working all
that was left was to clean things up a
bit
so I kind of want to just laser cut a
piece of wood that'll go sort of around
here out for some sand bags and have
perfect mounts to the motor and then on
Monday we'll have to thrust bearing
arrive for this and we're basically done
just clean up the electronics a bit put
it in like a nice box or something
yes do we have to make a nice box the
best box I can't make good boxes though
we could laser cut a box and you
basically know how this works now CAD
laser and boom we're good to go except
wood is a pain I think it's fine and
different pieces can have slightly
different properties so a bit of TLC was
even here there it's still looking
pretty good it's a four foot job you can
get pretty close
like that works a bit with the top piece
cut we attached some two by fours on the
bottom for support and edy filled in the
letters using permanent marker since we
couldn't just leave the electronics
lying on the floor we decided to stash
them in a den case using double sided
tape and after a little bit of love
everything actually fit in surprisingly
well any holes were closed using acrylic
damnit haha well that actually cut me
are you bleeding
looks like we yeah and in the end it's
not looking half bad if we do say so
ourselves so now that the Fitness PC mm
is ready to be set up at an actual desk
well maybe it's time for us to show it
to me is that just sharpie marker wow
that actually looks surprisingly good
like good for what we would normally do
yeah okay sandbag goes here so basically
what we've just got a motor here with it
did you make this out of wood why give a
man a Laser laser cutter the laser cut
anything 200 watts you mean
you see power okay so 200 watts is our
maximum output here you guys probably
realize then that if you have a powerful
rig that's not enough for you to
actually power up your gaming machine
while you gain but any more than that
would be quite difficult for most people
to to do just by pedaling anyway so
should we evaluate now just how usable
this is yeah so you know here what what
should i what should I try to do just
browse the forum watch some YouTube
videos I got to say it is a little bit
harder to type while I'm you know going
ham on the on the exercise bicycle but
it's not as bad as you might think oh
look at this I'm not operated mess thank
all these crit what are these nice tech
tips guys doing one thing that is a
little bit tough is you can actually
feel the resistance changing sometimes
like it'll it'll almost like it'll let
you know when you need to give her a
little bit more do we know why exactly
that is I have to do with the battery
charging or
so what could I do that would make it
draw more power should we try to power
the whole the whole thing with it yeah
let's do it let's do it okay so here we
go
powering up the computer Wow so you get
like a real physical feedback for the
amount of power that your components are
drawing like during guna Oh like it
initialized something there I felt it
whoa that is some good resistance we got
going here I'm gonna work up a sweat
pretty quick here let's get this demo
going you know that's actually not that
bad
and it's a constant load now where is
like the spikes and CPU activity before
I could really feel them you would get
absolutely crap okay that really is
really unforgiving the second generation
of this product definitely needs like a
Philips hue that gives you like a
reading on your battery or like a
capacitor right so if you had a big fat
capacitor and then it was like green
when it's full and then would slowly go
to yellow and red that would be cool
you'd probably want to get one of those
stupid mice from thermaltake that has
the fan in it they have a keyboard with
one to keep your keep your palms from
getting too sweaty and your arms from
getting too heavy this might be a little
extreme I think having it plugged into
the network switch is good enough okay
sure to try and play a game
come on okay place yes go ah no no no
just load the math come on just I just
want to play one round okay
CT here we go so CP use it like 25% and
GPUs going up as high as like 80-100 Oh
almost fell behind for a second there no
I give up
the new Volta XL charging cable delivers
great value durability and some
enhancements over the original it's
capable of delivering up to 87 watts at
4.3 m/s allowing it to be compatible
with fast charging devices with on the
go charging functionality it'll allow
your phone to act as a battery bank to
help you charge up other gadgets and the
snag safe tips are made from an N 52
neodymium magnet that offers a strong
solid connection which enables you to
quickly connect your devices but also
acts as a safety in case you get your
cables caught on anything they're made
of strong military grade nylon and they
come with a lifetime guarantee on the
cable so check out their IndieGoGo page
at the link in the video description oh
oh my legs so if the goal was an
exercise bike that makes you literally
get a sweat the mission fucking
accomplished the fitness PC is a huge
success so thanks again for watching
guys if you disliked this video you can
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description all sit down there's our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one but not pre soaked and sweat
and our community forum which you should
totally join I am like actually dripping
all over the place right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
