there are certain trends really old
cases tended to be beige then cable
space behind the motherboard trays
expanded rubber grommets and cable
management holes became common everyone
started introducing basements and now
tempered glass tempered glass is
everywhere all three of the last cases
that I've reviewed including this one
has included some amount of tempered
glass and the anodized AI crystal has
even more glass than the others so it
must be great
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description the front of the case
when the computer is off appears minimal
Scandinavian even once the computer is
on however the three included entities
branded 140 millimeter white LED fans
shine through the front mounted tempered
glass in a rather beautiful way although
it should be noted that the brightness
of the LEDs is dependent on the speed of
the fans so it is inherently variable
this also reveals that they are kept
mostly clean by a magnetically mounted
filter that you will need to remove said
front panel to access the top of the
case has spots for two more 140
millimeter fans or three 120 millimeter
fans although it is currently empty and
also has a magnetically mounted filter
on the outside of the case although
tragically there were no holes cut in
the filter where the screws could go
through so it doesn't rest flat if you
don't have completely flat mounting
screws used here and just like the
filter at the front of the case it
doesn't seem fine enough to be all that
effective at actually blocking that much
dust closer up there is the i/o which
includes two USB 3.0 ports two USB 2.0
ports a reset button a large LED lit
power button headphone and microphone
jacks with unfortunately offset logos
and a fan controller listed with L s and
H which seems to stand for low stop and
high respectively although it is yet
again unfortunate that the position of
the switch doesn't actually line up with
the corresponding letters the left side
of the case features a large
all-encompassing tempered glass panel
which features rubber ring screws and
female thread points in order to protect
the glass from scratches and a warning
sticker saying tempered glass handle
with care' which is a good thing because
miss handling tempered glass and having
it break doesn't just suck because you
lose a case panel it's a nightmare to
clean up as well the bottom of the case
features some pretty standard feet
reminiscent of something that you might
find on say a Corsair carbide series of
cases
and a filtered intake for your power
supply which does seem fine enough to be
effective at blocking dust from getting
into the case it's actually a different
filter the right-hand side has another
beautiful tempered glass panel which
reveals the back of the wait hold on a
second what are those what are those are
those the fractal fins they look like
the fractal fins on the front intake
fractal also has a large flat
scandinavian styled front panel and
intakes exactly like these on the side
of their front panels what are those
after some research no this is not a
collaboration project despite the
outside resembling a fractal case with a
tempered glass facelift some further
looks into their website also revealed
some other oddities like a multi USB
port charger that looked very
suspiciously almost exactly the same as
an anchor charter even down to some of
the fine details and the specs seems
rather fishy but I don't have nearly
enough information to make any actual
accusations so I'll leave you guys to
come to your own conclusions and moving
on the back of the case features a
sliding cover for the expansion cards
and non thumb screws which is rather
annoying and makes the screws not even
that easy to remove we don't have a
screwdriver in the shop that can easily
remove these and I'm constantly afraid
I'm going to strip them anytime I try to
remove them moving up the back we have
some metal stopped management holes for
external water cooling who the hell
would use those they look so ugly I mean
okay we apparently would use them for
like whole room water cooling but that's
not a good metric to go by we're crazy
we're not average consumers the inside
of the back showing the motherboard tray
has ample cable management loops for zap
straps three beautifully displayed SSD
trays a really weird CPU heatsink cutout
which doesn't actually properly reveal
all of the screw holes for the heatsink
and last of all an extreme lack of depth
there isn't enough room back here to
properly run your cables and have a
tempered glass panel installed to
counter this you would have to flat
mount all of your cables which is
extremely tedious and frustrating down
below in the basement area there are two
3.5 inch hard drive mounts and
a power supply that sits up on some
extended legs to get it off the base of
the case a nice touch moving inside the
main compartment however things continue
to be weird when I tried to remove their
protective film from their company logo
some of the letters started to come off
and then there's this thing on the right
hand side it covers up some of your
cable management which is cool all in
all this is a stunning case well I had
it set up in the bench den a number of
people came by and commented on how
fabulous it looked it looks mysterious
and beautiful and as such things
sometimes go it is unsurprisingly a
little crazy when you look a little bit
closer the choice is yours to stick your
computer in crazy or to not let me know
