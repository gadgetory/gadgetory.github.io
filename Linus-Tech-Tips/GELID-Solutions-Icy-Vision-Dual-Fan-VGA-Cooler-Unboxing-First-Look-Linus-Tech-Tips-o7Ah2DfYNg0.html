first vga cooler from gilad solutions
gelid has a huge lineup of fans they've
got some cpu coolers under their belt
they have excellent thermal compound but
this is their first foray into a vga
cooling solution so it has dual UV blue
fans 5 power heat 5 power heat pipes I'm
not sure what they mean by power heat
pipes but I can tell you right now that
the heat pipes will not consume extra
power in your system that's right if you
have a gtx 480 the heat pipes will not
make your power consumption higher so
you don't have to worry about that
support is pretty much there for almost
all current video in fact all current
video cards that even have support for
the 5850 5870 the gtx 470 as well as a
gtx 480 so the compatibility list goes
all the way back to the 4800 series as
well as the 9800 series for NVIDIA so
that's pretty darn good now in terms of
performance gelid claims and here let's
see if I can zoom in on this that you
can actually read it gelid claims on the
gtx 480 so here's their own here's their
test bench they are using here we are oh
wow that's interesting they're using
someone else's cpu cooler when they
actually have their own cpu cooler very
strange but they're using a gtx 480 from
masseuse and they're claiming that under
load when you're overclocked so that's
the the green bar here it's almost 20
degrees cooler than the stock fan while
running at i'm going yeah while running
at a much slower RPM so you're going to
get much better acoustic performance out
of the IC vision so here is the ban
Chado 101 interesting so here is the
stock yeah ok so they've just reiterated
that again over here interesting here is
their overclock lon mild 800 megahertz
overclock but still 72 degrees at 2,000
RPM is a lot better than 91 degrees at
3,300 RPM so here we can see the back of
the cooler here we can see the front of
the cooler so there's your dual what
appear to be 92 millimeter fans
and they are UV blue let's get this
thing opened up I have nothing talking
about the packaging premium aluminum
fins pure copper base google f shape
fans for twenty percent more airflow
okay ball bearing for long lifetime and
they are crossfire and sli compatible
but something you will have to watch out
for is that this cooler does appear to
be a triple slog cooler so unless your
system has the own actually hold on
let's see if I think it is a triple slot
cooler okay here in just a moment here
so here's a here's a video card and here
is the cooler so yeah this has gotta be
a triple slot cooler so unless you've
got the appropriate spacing so you can
see here I've got a motherboard that has
one pcie slot two additional slots
another pcie slot and two additional
slots so if you had two of these coolers
you would be effectively using all of
the slots in this motherboard so just be
aware of that alright so let's have a
look at the accessory package first we
have woo color instructions very very
nice Thank You gelid solutions i always
appreciate a color instruction booklet
these are great diagrams to i can tell
right off of that they've gone and shown
you all of the necessary little steps
where to install all the little ram
sinks everything that you need they've
got this is for the nvidia series here
and then i'm guessing on the other side
is going to be a TI series yeah here's
your ati series instructions all right
very nice so it's about a nine step
program to install your graphics card
cooler here they've got an adapter so
the IC whoops i forgot what it's called
yeah the IC vision there that's not that
complicated the IC vision comes with one
of these little proprietary video card
fan connectors but you can go ahead and
adapt it to either a 3-pin fan connector
or molex connector so even though it has
two fans you only have to plug it in
with one header so that's pretty handy
ok that includes some GC to thermal
compound which is this color ok then it
also includes a bunch of ram sinks so
those are here all right so these are
low profile Ram Singh's so I'm guessing
these are the ones that are going to go
under the cooler itself and the thermal
pads are not pre-applied which honestly
I don't really mind because it's not
really much easier to peel off the
backing and then stick it on than it is
to just feel off two sides of backing
and put it on the the ram singh so here
are the actual you can tell right away
these are three unbranded thermal pads
and then they've also got another
thermal interface for where did that guy
go I saw it before all right here we
have a multi okay let's just finish with
this so we've got some washers here
these are for making sure that nothing
shorts out you've got some more thermal
interface material we had some bigger
sinks some smaller sinks so basically
gallatin making sure they got all their
bases covered no matter what little
chips you need to throw singsong then we
have all of the mounting screws and
hardware for actually attaching the IC
vision to your video card then we have a
little gelid case patch thank you for
that then over here we have more stuff
and if I can oh yeah there it is I knew
I saw this somewhere so this is what
that long thermal strip was for this guy
right here someone we just just that
we're in kind of a slippery shirt today
when the camera isn't staying in place
as long as I'd like so that's going to
be for VRMs on one card or another then
we have the actual hold down our
backplate rather I could get this out
then that would be waiting there we go
and finally one last little heat sink ok
so there's another heatsink and here is
the backplate Universal basket by the
look of things so you've got lots and
lots of different mounting holes in
there alright let's have a look at the
IC vision itself so here's our two fans
these spin a 2000 rpm although there's
no reason you couldn't turn them down if
you're content with having higher GPU
temperatures and you're more interested
in just keeping the noise levels down so
you can see we are using aluminum fins
here so let's see how many heat pipes we
have going to each one of these thin
arrays so we've got basically what
amounts to kind of two slim fans mounted
on to kind
I guess they're about each about the
size of an 80 millimeter water cooling
radiator or so so you got three heat
pipes going to this one and then you've
got 12 heat pipes going to this one
right here yeah yeah that's correct so
there's actually five heat pipes running
through the base and we'll do the
obligatory finger shot here where we
show how shiny it is it's not
particularly shiny although it does look
to be machined quite flat the base is a
bit of a more of a matte finish whereas
the heat pipes have actually got like a
shiny polished finish to them it looks
quite nice and then let me see if
there's anything else to really show you
about it why don't I just sort of do
some camera work here and just show you
the icy vision and all its glory here
you can kind of I haven't installed it
yet obviously but you can sort of
visualize what it will look like on a
gtx 480 I do this so there there's a 480
in its stock state and there's one with
an icy vision and if you happen to
already have gelid wing UV blue fans and
this will go really well with it which i
happen to have so I'm I feel quite
privileged to have get my hands on the
icy vision and yes I guess there's not
too much more to say about it what is
really going to come down to is how well
it performs and hopefully I'll have a
chance to test it in the near future and
show you guys my results thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the gullet
solutions I see vision vga cooler</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
