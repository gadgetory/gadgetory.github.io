knight blade it's a basic card in
hearthstone it costs five man I think
it's a 4/4 with a battlecry that deals
three damage to an enemy hero pretty
decent card but actually I meant that
case it's on the table there oh I guess
I can review that coolermaster v-series
semi modular power supply's feature 80
plus gold efficiency and their gold
guarantee five-year warranty click now
to learn more packaging wise I know
Linus would be proud the packaging
material in this case is a fantastic
soft foam but that's boring so let's
move on most of the front of the case is
a brushed metal with diamond cut edges
finish which is only interrupted by a
gaming series case badge a small MSI
logo on the bottom and a start loading
optical drive on the left hand side just
above that we see the front i/o which
includes two each of us be 2.0 and 3.0
ports along with audio jacks you know
see switch a power button a wireless
signal LED and a storage led down on the
bottom of the front panel we see some
ventilation holes accented by an abuse
ready carrying handle seriously that
thing is pretty beast it's thick metal
construction makes me pretty confident
that it won't give weight no matter how
much I resemble an ogre and if your hand
model who's scared of picking up
something that is possibly made of metal
they also include a soft handle cover
while the handle cover may be a nice
addition I'm not sure I would use it
personally as I think it looks much
better without and the standard metal
handle actually does come with a nice
slip resistant rubber pad on the bottom
by default the top bottom and side
panels all feature ventilation holes
with the bottom panel including an
externally removable filter which due to
the upwards angle provided by the
carrying handle is able to be removed
cleaned and replaced without picking up
the case which in my opinion is pretty
damn cool the left side panel also
includes a silhouette of the MSI gaming
series dragon just to the right of the
ventilation holes which fits the
aggressive styling of this case once we
get to the back you'll notice there's a
power plug at the top which has been
extended there from the 600 watt 80 plus
gold power supply which is mounted
vertically in the front of the case
for motherboard i/o we have a standard
setup of audio jacks for each USB 2.0
and 3.0 ports two HDMI ports a display
port a spit if digital audio out to a
set of ports a ps2 port and Ethernet
jack and dual wireless antennas then we
get to the screws on the back which left
me a little bit confused to be honest
for the back side panel they've opted to
go with standard run-of-the-mill screws
I would have liked to see at least thumb
screws here and then for the top and
bottom panels they went with thumb
screws but they don't have anywhere to
undo it with a natural screw driver
which is kind of odd luckily they don't
come pre-installed too brutally and can
be easily taken off by hand these screws
also have a double function by acting as
a stand for when you want to put the
case down after carrying it you want to
put it down vertically because that's
how it hangs off your hand but you have
to make sure that nothing's plugged in
especially not the included antennas as
they are exactly designed to carry the
weight of a computer you can easily
forget them back there last but not
least you have the sliding locks on the
left side panel which are extremely easy
to use but unfortunately leave the panel
with a fair amount of wiggle room I
would have liked to see even an optional
thumb screw hole on just the side panel
just in case I didn't want my side panel
to jiggle around despite the odd
arrangement of screws and locking
mechanisms on the back of the case it is
pretty awesome that you can take off the
top bottom front and both side panels
very easily
this makes the expectedly cramped
building area actually feel larger than
it is resulting in a much easier build
in a more open space one last thing
before we go inside the case is the
aesthetically pleasing little fan that I
have on the back to explain what I mean
by aesthetically pleasing usually if you
were to mount a fan in this orientation
and look at it from the outside you
would see the company logo structure
supporting bars and power cabling for
the fan in this case they have designed
the fan specifically to be the other way
around so that it can maintain its good
looks from the outside very nice touch
upon taking off the side panels you'll
notice the side fan bracket which has a
funny note and a pretty intense warning
message on it
first off and I quote note installing
the side fan may increase the acoustic
level so essentially installing a thing
that creates a byproduct of noise may
increase your noise level
thanks secondly and I quote warning
hazardous moving parts keep fingers and
other body parts away I just really I
don't know in all seriousness though
this bracket is well implemented and
will help you cool some of your more
thermally demanding graphics cards and
CPUs but I would have liked to see MSI
actually include a stock fan here I
can't imagine that a second fan would
have really increased the bom cost by
all that much and while I realize they
only actually suggest it for an r9
series kind of graphics card I know more
than a few people out there that would
install one just to keep their system
that much cooler in general on the right
hand side you'll see a mounting bracket
that holds the slimline optical drive
bay and three-and-a-half-inch Bay this
mounting bracket will have to be
unscrewed and removed in order to
install something into that
three-and-a-half-inch Bay and another
note is that on this side if you for
some reason want to replace your PSU you
can take it out by removing all of the
screws and lowering its hole mounting
bracket and for some of you out there
that want to be rather adventurous it is
possible then to swap in a modular PSU
but you'll have a fair amount of metal
cutting in your future and you'll be
voting your warranty up in the top we
have our dual two and a half inch bay
which comes pre-installed with the nifty
little M SATA device now I don't
honestly see a ton of people using this
dual M SATA device but some people might
use it and regardless it's a cool little
additional feature anyways and once
you're done with this case it is
removable so you can take it out and
take it with you a nice little
additional value the drive rails are
pretty secure and when you push them in
they click in really nicely they're not
just going to randomly slide out on you
so pretty solid overall jumping behind
the motherboard tray for a second we can
see that there's a fan filter for the
PSU on the left hand side which is quite
nice and an utter lack of any cable
management options whatsoever so what
exactly do you do for cable management
not much but because you don't have to
which is not that bad almost every cable
you will need is pre ran for you with
plastic clips holding them in place and
the cables aren't exactly out of sight
but they're also quite well taken care
of and easy to access if you need to
routing themselves tightly around
various devices within the case so
they're not
your way while you're working thanks to
the very large sized girl on the bottom
of the case and the elevation from the
handle the graphics card is able to
breathe quite easily also if you're
worried about your GPU when carrying the
case around with the handle you can rest
a wee bit easier because MSI has
included a GPU supporter which is
essentially an adjustable plastic
bracket that will keep your GPU from
sagging down too much back inside the
case we can see the NH - L 12 knocked to
a cooler that I installed it fits
perfectly in this case and I would
highly suggest it if you do decide to go
with the night plate in the future this
cooler is quite large and includes two
fans and still allows you to access
things like SATA ports just in case you
want to make changes to the computer at
some later date speaking of the NH - L
12 I have two questions for you guys if
you like me to review the NH - L 12
comparing it versus a stock cooler in
the knight blade and against other
performance coolers in my standard
standard cooling bench and also are you
interested in bare-bones systems at all
or are you kind of the person that wants
to build everything from scratch let me
know in the comments down below and on
the forum I'll see you guys in either of
those locations if you're on the forum
you want to get rid of the ads become a
contributor it gets rid of all of them
again if you don't like my short or your
shirt or your friend's shirt added
