videos where someone gets caught doing
something super dumb and thought how
could you prove that just happened and
you weren't the one being dumb if you
didn't have a dashcam the answer is you
probably couldn't but there are a lot of
Terra bad dash cams out there and it's
hard to tell the good ones from the bad
so I took it upon myself to create this
video showing off six of the most
popular models out there because I know
you guys love my videos so much there
are two main kinds of setups single
camera and dual camera single camera is
pretty self-explanatory most people
mounted facing forward but the second
camera in a dual system can be deployed
in a couple of different ways depending
on your needs a cabbie for example might
be less concerned about capturing a rear
ender versus a destructive passenger in
the back seat we'll start with the
cheapest of our single camera contenders
the g1w comes in at around fifty dollars
depending on which company rebadged it
it has a surprisingly good picture and
that's pretty much all it has going for
it like any generic Chinese electronics
product the menu system is kind of bad
so the translation isn't great the menus
navigation is bad and you just have to
hope that the settings thick and that
they do what they say they do so in
fairness there aren't that many things
you can change anyway it's ugly and kind
of sticks out so if you live in the kind
of neighborhood where someone might walk
by and go hey that looks like something
I should steal you might not have it for
very long if you leave it mounted all
the time but as long as you use the
suction cup instead of the janky
quick-release to take it down it's 140
degree horizontal fov and decent light
quality make it a good buy personally
though I'd spend another 15 bucks on the
Sky View a 1-1 eight its footage looks
as good as the g1w but it's got a wider
field of view a better quick-release
system though it would benefit from an
upgrade to the adhesive and it's much
more compact and selfie so you probably
we won't have to take it down anyway
these little upgrades might not seem
like much but they feel like the
difference between a real dash cam and a
web cam that you stick on to your
windshield which might be confusing when
you see my pic for our premium single
cam the Xiaomi V dash cam my Serio still
why it looks so much like an action cam
is that they basically recycle the Yi
action cam when they realize people were
already using it as a dash cam the good
news is that thanks to this heritage the
picture from the Yi dash cam is great
it's sharp enough to read license plates
during the day and at night things are
pretty clear as long as there's some
street lighting it's got the highest
resolution of anything we tested at
twelve ninety sixty and there's more
good stuff to the user interface for
setting everything up it's also the best
of the dash cam so far it's clean its
attractive and it's responsive you can
even do this via Wi-Fi on your phone and
that is similarly responsive and quick
to connect unfortunately the form factor
makes it incredibly easy to spot from
the outside and the premium look as much
as I might like it makes it an even more
attractive target for would-be thieves
thankfully it does have a good
quick-release system but at this price
point I think Xiaomi should have
considered this and designed a more
subtle housing for factory criticism
aside though but Yi dash cam is a great
package that feels like a piece of
modern net consumer electronics well
everything else feels like it was
designed by an accountant in 2010 the
dual channel systems could learn a thing
or two from Xiaomi in spite of their
much higher prices all suffered from
lesser image quality overall and
clunkier Wi-Fi connectivity which is an
even bigger problem since none of them
have screens or menus built in then why
would you buy a dual Channel system
instead of a temple DS well it's easier
to set up one camera than to separately
they can record to a single SD card you
can adjust the G sensor sensitivities
for different directions of movement
while driving and there's parking mode
which allows the cameras to record
vandalism or hit runs first up is the
black sis campus it's image quality is
unexceptional and its form factor might
not be super stylish
it's subtle enough to blend in so the
main benefit though is it's parking mode
the app may not be pretty but it allows
the number of key variables to be
tweaked like tunings a motion detection
in certain parts of the frame or
treating one of the cameras off
altogether
all of these things are important
because for parking mode to work it
needs to be wires into your car battery
and the board's are recording the faster
that will drain fortunately while axis
includes a low voltage cutoff that will
prevent your battery from dying outright
making this kit popular among thinkers
and people who park on the street often
the same can be said of the BlackVue
dr650 gw2 channel it does have a basic
parking mode with tunable motion
settings and shock sensitivities as
you'd expect but you'll need an add-on
kit from the manufacturer to protect
your battery so why would you choose
this one well it looks really cool I
mean physically not the image quality
which I would describe as good enough in
spite of the 720p rear cam I mean if you
think about it if you get rear-ended
they're going to get pretty close to
your camera anyway right overall there's
not much to set the blackvue apart from
the pack they're cloud backup solution
won't really make much sense until
mobile data is a lot cheaper which
brings us to the sink where f7 70 it's
not cheaper but I like this one the most
it doesn't have as many settings as the
blackness you can fiddle voice for
parking mode and it's not as
cool-looking and compact as black you
but the image quality at night is the
best of the gold channel systems with
1080p recording on both front and rear
cams you get voltage cutoff built in
like the blackness and though the
parking mode zoom figuration options
aren't as detailed I think they struck
the best balance between tunability
and simplicity it has the biggest
footprint on your windshield but by
staying more flush to the windshield it
ended up being more discreet the thing
where also features recording - built-in
flash memory for emergencies in case
your SD cards fail somehow and the
feature I like the most it warns you of
red-light cameras not that I run red
lights all that often
this is under the built-in GPS and good
locations can be updated by downloading
them from their site so conclusion time
some of the dash cams feature additional
driver safety systems like lane
departure and collision warning but
they're all inaccurate inconsistent and
in the case of the G dash cam really
annoying
none of them are anywhere near as
accurate as my car's built-in systems
and frankly I wouldn't recommend buying
them for these features for a basic
single cam the g1w is fine if you're
looking to spend as little as possible
but the a1 1/8 gets my pick due to the
form factor as for the dual cams the
image quality on the f7 780 think where
and it's red light warning help justify
its price but at the end of the day the
black says campus offers the best
functionality at the lowest price total
