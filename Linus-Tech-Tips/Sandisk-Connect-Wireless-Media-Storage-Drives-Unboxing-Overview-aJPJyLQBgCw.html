now to learn more so the problem of not
having enough storage space on your
phone or tablet has kind of been a thing
for a while so to speak and the new
thing to deal with that thing is
Wireless storage so SanDisk is throwing
bear hat into the ring with the San
disconnect series so this is the
wireless flash drive and the wireless
media drive so these are intended to
work with whether it's your PC or your
Mac or your iOS device or your Android
device phones tablets computers all that
kind of stuff to expand your storage and
allow you to access it wirelessly so
they both support WPA 2 Wi-Fi protection
access from around 150 feet they both
support 8 concurrent users for file
sharing but this is where things start
to get a little bit different so the
flash drive let's do a quick tour of
this one support streaming video 2 up to
3 concurrent users comes with 16 gigs of
storage in it by default although you
can increase that now I think they call
it expandable storage but I wouldn't
quite call it expandable storage because
it's more like increase it'll store egde
because this contrary to what you might
think from its form factor is not
actually a thumb drive it's more of a
micro SD card reader so it comes with a
16 gig micro SD card inside there you go
so there's a SanDisk Ultra card in there
it also supports up to 4 hours of
continuous streaming so that's around
half the battery life of the larger
media drive and I think that was the
other main difference ok so fewer
concurrent users for video and only four
hours on a charge next up we've got the
wireless media drive which actually has
a really nice ID so this is more of the
premium product so it's got kind of a
nice textured square finish on the top
of it actually looks quite striking and
then an aluminum band around the outside
so there's the charging port it comes
with a charging cable as well as a wall
wart that should be I'm guessing a 500
milliamp Alward 300 milliamp long wart
okay there you go and then also this one
has a power button right here and
finally yes SD card
Panchen so there's 32 gigs inside and
you can actually add additional memory
to it as needed with a full sized SD
card this one supports five concurrent
users for video eight hours of
battery-life and eight concurrent users
for just general file sharing however
with all of these devices I could tell
you oh yeah this one charges just by
plugging in via USB and then the power
buttons here this one I mean all these
devices are pretty much the same thing
except it's gonna come down to software
support so we're gonna fire up the app
and see how well it works
so SanDisk actually has two separate
apps one for the pendrive and one for
the media drive so we use the media
drive one just because they seemed to be
pretty similar otherwise if you've ever
used one of these before you'll be
familiar with this so you basically just
connect to the Wi-Fi network that it is
it doesn't come with any security on it
by default but the good news is that
when you go into the settings you know
I'm just going to go ahead and put this
down right here so when you go into the
settings it's really easy to figure out
the default admin stuff so you just put
admin admin and then you can log-in
update your firmware see your battery
life all that kind of cool stuff which
is neat you also have a few different
ways to browse your files so you I
generally prefer just looking at a
directory structure so here we can check
out my resume see there you go haven't
been one of those in a long time yay
LinkedIn and then you can see there's
some default music on here so it goes
ahead it plays within its own media
player app and unfortunately the media
player app has very limited
compatibility so we have some
approaching Nirvana songs that it
unfortunately wasn't able to play
because they are WAV files another
example of sort of limited limited
compatibility was you can see mp4s are
the ones that are supported by the
default app I wouldn't have minded
seeing integration with third-party apps
like co-player so this adventure time
video plays just fine but here's a much
higher bitrate file this is a 1080p file
that I recorded with this phone and
unfortunately playing back wirelessly
does stutter a little bit I don't know
if you guys can see that but it is able
to I see there it goes but it is able to
play it back because it is compatible
other than that you're able to uh yes
browsing photos so check this out it
comes with some pre-loaded photo
so you can go ahead and check those out
it takes a little while to load the
first time so I was getting a little bit
of loading time before but you can see
it's not nearly as bad anymore so that's
my old computer if you guys want to
check that I've got my all-in-one der
9600 Pro in there so basically the
conclusion is very small very compact
great ID particularly on the media drive
that is industrial design for those of
you who aren't familiar with that but I
would like to see some more maturity on
the app itself one thing that I do like
about it is that you have the option to
download the files locally should you so
desire so that should eliminate any kind
of like stuttering or weirdness so I
wouldn't mind seeing them integrate sort
of other third-party players with the
files that you can play back or I mean
you look at how long someone like
Seagate has been working on their media
player app and sort of how mature that
is so I think we're probably going to
see this continue to evolve over time
