the samsung 830 series now I've been
asked a lot of times to talk about the
830 series but the cold hard truth was I
didn't have one no I do now I can talk
about it because the scent okay here
let's start with some context here guys
Samsung is the world's number one SSD
everything they are doing so many OEM
drives date that okay when your Samsung
you actually build every component of
the SSD nobody else does that even Intel
I mean they fab flash so they do flash
um they don't do their own controller
anymore okay so let's find those find
other guys ah micron doesn't use their
own controller they use their own flash
but not their own controller I mean you
look at guys like ocz where they're
designing firmwares and they are working
on controller designs and all that but
they don't actually build it and they
don't actually fab flash they just get
huge volume discounts due to their
hugeness so Samsung is the only one that
actually builds the entire thing from
the ground up in every possible way what
advantages does that give it well number
one it gives them a cost advantage so
they can deliver high-performance
products at very competitive costs what
other advantages does it give them it
gives them full control of the creative
process of creating the drive so if
there's anything that goes well with the
drive Samsung knows who to give the
credit to if there's anything that goes
wrong with the drive there's no one for
some some to blame that gives them a
vested interest in making sure that
everything they do is really good
because the Heike app there you go
there's no ambiguity about who screwed
it up if something goes wrong this is
the desktop upgrade version of their
Drive so it comes in a full retail box
and includes a whole bunch of really
cool stuff so you got a molex to SATA
power adapter aceite cables all the
mounting screws you could possibly need
whether you're installing it in actually
will notebooks will come with all the
mounting screws you need
these old mount the SSD to this and then
they will mount this to your computer
comes with a copy of norton ghost Cole
so this will allow you to quickly and
easily upgrade your existing drive to
your SSD comes with their interactive
manual magician software and insist
Emmanuel comes with a hard copy of there
quick user manual and pad look at this
unpacking it has a guide for what I'm
doing I can follow the instructions on
how to do an unboxing at hem page 4 I'm
packing check your product box for the
following items please refer to the back
on the package to see the installation
kit you have purchased the illustrations
may differ from your actual items that's
pretty much what I do isn't it alright
it also includes nice solidly built
desktop adapter so you mount your SSD
here you mount your thing to your case
and then even if your case doesn't
natively support to a half inch drives
you'll have no problem installing it so
this is an 830 drive the 830 drive is
pretty much as good as it gets out there
in terms of performance it has a three
year warranty and it does not have the
same disadvantage that ass and force
controller has where it performs really
well with compressible data it's doing
data compression on the fly and
uncompressed on the fly when it's
writing and reading what that means is
in order to achieve the speeds they've
gone for the need a faster can well not
a faster controller they need faster
flash and they need to very very
carefully build it in tune it in order
to ensure that Sam force doesn't
absolutely blow it away when it comes to
compressible data so a samsung drive
will perform the same regardless of what
you're doing on it compared to a san
force drive will perform it
significantly better in certain
applications and significantly worse in
others one of the other oh yeah this is
one of the other things one of the other
things that Samsung has an advantage of
with when they're building their own
stuff is that they get to keep all the
best for themselves flash is all about
binning so if you guys don't understand
the bidding process we actually have an
NCIX tech tips episode that's all about
bidding what it means but what in a
nutshell it means that they produce a
bunch of flash and cherry-pick
everything they want and then anything
they don't want well that can go to
someone else to build USB thumb drives
what do they care they took the best
stuff they used it in their own products
to make sure that their customer
just get the absolute cream of the crop
negative better reliability it gives you
better speeds and it gives you well in
terms of for samsung it gives the lower
RMA rates and better brand perception so
it's good for absolutely everybody so
there's your Samsung logo there's your
brush metal finish there's your capacity
indication on the side you find your
standard mounting holes on the other
side you find your other more different
standard mounting holes and then on the
bottom you find you're completely more
different than those standard mounting
holes depending on what kind of a
notebook you have this is also a slim
SSD which is great because it means that
you can install it anywhere some
notebook computers only have room for
slim SSDs so there's only there's about
that much more on some SSDs makes them a
little bit thicker so whoops I almost
dropped it but I didn't but it wouldn't
have mattered because flash is very
durable and is I can can handle that on
the back we find our seat of power
connector as well as our state of 36
gigabit per second interface and I think
that pretty much covers it for now don't
forget subscribe to Linus tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and thank you for watching my
video about the samsung 830 series 512
