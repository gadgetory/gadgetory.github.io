incessantly about my high devices
coverage and I just want you to know
this is yeah I'm not this is not a real
blog video this is more of just an
update that I am working on it ok so I'm
I'm at home I brought home all the
testing equipment so that I got okay
I'll just give you guys a quick tour of
what I have going on in the lab right
now so there's a bunch of Motorola Xoom
accessories there's an intel core i3
21:05 so that's for testing against a
embiez apu got some graphics cards got
some unboxings including 990 FX boards
which many of you have been demanding
some other cool stuff all of this is
heavy PC stuff I've got the old video
card box so I'll be needing that because
I have some exciting stuff coming up a
75 990 FX 8 9 the FX I'm gonna be doing
a comparison between those two with the
1100 T I'm gonna take a look at the
matrix GTX 580 I've got another f1 that
is a 75 board I've actually just figured
out a benchmarking procedure for br3
which or two there's at least one other
game dirt3 I think I'm just going to use
the built-in bench mark and then Crysis
2 DirectX 11 so I'm actually going to be
doing an updated graphics card
performance guide for some of the newer
games that have been released since I
did my reviews on these high-end cards
they've got a Patriot wildfire here
which I've been using for some stuff so
basically yes I have tons of totally PC
content for you guys I've been at it all
day today it's Canada Day it's a day off
but here I am two o'clock in the morning
still hard at work so I actually what
I've been working on for the last few
hours is finding good easily
reproducible benchmark sequences in
those games so that I can use fraps to
record the frame rate see look it's dark
outside
see I'll put a lens right up against the
window so you can see
so yes I have heard you more PC content
coming but there will also be Apple
content deal with it that is all
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
