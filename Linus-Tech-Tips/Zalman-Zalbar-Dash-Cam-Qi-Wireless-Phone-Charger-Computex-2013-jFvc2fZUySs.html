remember that big huge asteroid that
went over Russia not that long ago came
in i think it was actually a meteorite
my bad it came in and everyone the way
everyone saw it was actually dash cams
in people's cars that actually boosted
dashcam sales by an insane amount and
now Zelman has a solution this is a
dashcam you can mount it inside of your
car it has internal recording through a
microSD slot you can plug in other
modules as well and it's fairly
straightforward it's just a dash cam but
these things I wanted to actually show
off because it's a really really good
idea not just for recording things like
meteorites which is obviously the most
practical use for them but also just in
case you want extra coverage for
insurance if you get in an accident and
you have a dashcam you have a live
recording of what actually just happened
so if someone rolls backwards at a
stoplight and you didn't actually hit
them normally that's your problem
because you hit the back of their car
but if you have a dash cam and you can
actually show that they just went way
back and nailed you and you weren't
actually at fault you can get out of
that claim and then they have to pay you
because that's how insurance works so
getting a dash cam is a very very good
idea now one other cool thing I don't
know why I just did a 360 but another
cool thing that they have is I'm showing
it on my phone right now it's not that
bulky but if you put it on your phone it
connects into your phone and allows you
to charge wirelessly so I'm going to
take my phone and put it up on this
plate and hopefully this will work as
you can see wireless charging has been
enabled so it's just a way to easily
make it so your phone can accept
wireless charging you can grab one of
these plates plug it in through an AC
port and throw it on top of your
computer throw it on top of your desk
cabaret by your keyboard have it
wherever you can even technically have
this plugged in and an AC jack that goes
into the smoke outlet in your car so if
you want to have wireless charging in
your car so you just throw it up on your
dash you want to have it by your
computer whatever that works the main
thing that I like about it is that it's
not actually that bulky a lot of these
wireless charging things add a ton of
space but that actually doesn't add much
my actual back play which is hopefully
in my pocket is like that and there's as
you might not be able see it very well i
think i've got another here we go here
go we're going to come over here pretty
basic thickness comparison right here is
it's actually not that big i know i'm
not holding these perfectly there we go
thinking this comparison it does add a
little bit of bulk but it's not much and
you gain a lot from having wireless
charging on your phone so thank you for
