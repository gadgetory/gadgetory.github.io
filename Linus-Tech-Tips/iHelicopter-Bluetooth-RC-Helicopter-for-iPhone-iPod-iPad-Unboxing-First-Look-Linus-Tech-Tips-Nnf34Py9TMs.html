already been previewed so it's I'm not
the first one opening it
but today we're gonna be having a look
at the eye superb which is apparently
the world's ultimate helicopter and it
is controlled by the iPhone iPod Touch
or iPad which is available there's an
app which is free available on the App
Store which I will definitely download
so this is not quite like something like
the ar.drone there's no built in you
know altimeter there's no built-in
camera showing you like a first-person
view but you can actually see what the
app looks like here so you got your
forward backwards and what looks like
probably it's gonna tilt the helicopter
this way that way and that way let's see
what else they got to say the endless
fun okay cool
fun with ascending and descending so you
can put it up or down and then you can
touch or tilt the iPhone to control safe
landing and emergency buttons path
record and playback function that's
interesting you can have multiple
helicopters chase each other so you are
controlling it through bluetooth no
adapter a dongle is needed so there's
actually a bluetooth chipset on the
helicopter itself which also means
you're not running off like sort of
old-fashioned radio frequencies so yes
you can have multiple helicopters in the
same room at the same time and you can
play songs from the iPhone during the
flight metal-framed and built-in
gyroscope all directions of precise
flight smooth hovering performance are
credibly easy to control intelligent
control system rechargeable long life
battery energy saving power cough and
true real-time control so there's said
an awful lot of times that we have true
and precise real-time control and I am
very curious to see how that turns out
in real life
from what I've heard so far about this
device and I have heard already about
this device it's actually really really
cool so here's what they mean by metal
construction metal rods here these are
plastic right here but there's a the
main rod here is metal going out to the
the tail
there's our motor independent motor for
that guy so it's not gear driven these
are gonna be counter rotating very very
flexible which is really really good for
me to see you can actually see it's
probably it's already got a couple dents
and it's probably been crashed a few
times already
but that's a really strong indicator the
fact that it has dents in it but they
haven't been broken but these are made
out of a good high-quality flexible
material there's a lot of given them
that means if they hit a wall or
something they're much more likely to
buckle like this than to actually snap
and break more metal construction here
and here this guy right here that the
canopy right here is plastic
there's our on and off switch hopefully
they sent it to me charged orally hope
so okay we've got a little LED on the
front which is kind of cool and yeah I
think that pretty much covers the device
itself you guys have seen it pretty up
close and personal now so what I want to
do now is show you any accessories that
it may or may not happen to come with
all if it comes with an extra tail
propeller that's very handy because
those two actually with Hallie's tend to
be one of the first things to break it
also comes with a USB charging cable and
I've seen this connector a lot of times
so this might actually come in handy if
you have other like low-cost RC devices
that you might also want to charge yeah
look at this it also comes with it spare
parts list okay
use your guide instructions of charging
the power batteries environment for
flight so fly indoors or on a sunny day
without wind do not fly and win so
they've made that very clear
charge the helicopter how to control it
here we go so you press this button for
up or down and then for steering you go
left and right and then for forward and
backward you go forward and back that
makes sense okay so this shows you how
to how do you adjust the trims all right
charging the helicopter haha here's how
to connect it and parrot so let me
figure this out and then I'll be back
into some omen
so once bluetooth is enabled on your
iDevice and you have turned on the
helicopter you just press the I super
helicopter under devices and they should
pair I actually don't use bluetooth much
so not sure how long this is gonna take
or anything like that connect it there
we go after it's connected you just go
ahead and launch the I super heli app
okay which looks a little something like
this
and then the first thing you're gonna
want to do is okay you begin to control
the helicopter so this you want it to be
at the bottom because that means you
know stopped and bottomed out so let's
go ahead and give me a second here to
sort of figure out what the heck it is
that I'm doing I haven't flew this yet
and yeah this goes
okay so I crashed into the Asus
Transformer which is not a good thing
let's try this one more time here okay
so that one rotates
Wow
so pull over in back
we're gonna watch the height there
my cats definitely interested in it
oh honey please don't touch that it's
gonna hurt you and it damages my wall
okay so well I to show you guys the
controls really quick here so you're
gonna want to find that looks a nice
hover setting in the middle so there you
go this controls how much sort of thrust
you're giving it so yeah I definitely
recommend removing curious pets from the
room see look how bad he is see how bad
he is before you play with something
like this so hope you go Rockets much
better behaved so he can stay all right
let's try this again so let's find that
hover point
rocket
sorry rocket yeah fourth time's the
charm here we go alright okay the
problem with my blade MSR I am used to
this joystick going like this and like
this but it actually controls the yaw
rather than the tilt on this particular
helicopter so I keep taking it and
trying to lean away from something and
instead I'm turning the tail towards it
so let me try this one more time here we
go
so there's up-and-down all right we got
that this time okay there's my hover
it's actually quite stable in a hover if
you don't do the wrong thing at all so
there you go there's my yaw control can
see that can you see the helicopter in
the background yeah okay good and then
this is my forward and backwards so I'd
imagine it takes a little while to get
the hang of it mind you this is my very
first flight and I've sort of got it now
but then I wouldn't by any means say
that I'm an expert with this particular
device but this is actually pretty cool
especially given the cost of the unit
itself okay there we go I'm not gonna
hate you this quickly can fly around in
a little circle forward okay we're not
gonna go too fast or anything but hey
hey there we go very cool
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing your first look at the I super
don't forget to subscribe
Kalani's tech tips from our unboxings
reviews and oh wow I totally forgot to
show you guys the tilt functionality so
here let's figure out how to do this so
I'm gonna turn on tilt
let's see what happens okay
hold on go over there thank you
okay we're not having as much luck with
tilt here hey I'm doing it wrong
okay yeah now I think we're done
although it's not busted maybe I did it
now no no hold on I have to put it in
the air again now I'm determined there
we go
you know I think I prefer the joystick
controls very very much to the other
ones thank you for checking out the
video don't forget to subscribe to our
