there cherry-picked so that the media
outlets like Linus tech tips will see
inflated performance and overclocking
numbers so that you yes you Jerry will
get suckered into buying a new CPU every
year right well that's what people keep
telling us and this common knowledge has
been around for years now so today in
our inaugural installment of viewers say
we are going to either prove that there
is something to this or debunk this myth
once and for all
thanks to ZOTAC by the way for bringing
us today's video the MEK 1 PC is an
ultra slim desktop built for gaming
featuring a sleek robotic themed design
check it out at the link below to learn
more
so here's how we decided to run our test
we grabbed our sample core i5 8400 and
not to play favorites our sample rise in
5 1600 X then we went to the local NCI
sorry memory express to buy retail chips
of the same to compare them against for
your peace of mind we will upload the
entire uncut clip of us buying the chips
and running our tests on them we're
gonna have that linked below anyway
let's talk about why it might make sense
or might not for a company to seed
reviewers a superior sample now the
obvious answer we hear all the time is
that they would get articles boasting of
better performance numbers or a better
overall user experience in that initial
oh so important wave of launch videos
and articles enticing consumers to open
up their wallets
all while not actually having to provide
that level of performance or polish at
retail but conspiracy theories aside
would this actually make business sense
imagine this you've got a lemonade stand
where you sell the freshest tastiest
lemonade on the Block on day one and
then you swap it out with lemon pledge
now a lot of people are gonna show up to
buy on the second day but as soon as
your reputation for selling what is
literally furniture polish spreads the
kids across the street who were selling
cheap powdered lemonade the whole time
are gonna take the bulk of the market
share now we're not saying this has
never happened
think back to watch dogs and no man's
sky and III both Ubisoft and Sony
respectively showed off beautifully
complex worlds with tons of graphical
detail and then both of them ended up
being significantly simplified upon
release now while in some industries it
is possible to get away with this kind
of BS in general the negative PR has the
potential to completely stall future
sales so it is not a risk to be taken
lightly and in electronics the up to
multi-billion dollar investment that
goes into designing and fabricating a
processor design makes this kind
switcheroo and economic impossibility
like it's not a different paint job so
then let's look at one of the other
theories maybe they're just taking
golden samples off of what is otherwise
the regular production line now that one
is much more likely but it doesn't
really hold up to closer scrutiny either
from my experience and others earlier
CPUs are produced at the tail end of the
manufacturing learning process when
viable yields are lower and compared to
the more mature units that come later
can actually require more voltage to
maintain a specific clock speed not to
mention that they might have poorer
memory compatibility or might output
more heat at the same performance levels
even the couple of weeks between early
samples shipping out and retail
availability can result in improvements
now there have been and there always
will be exceptions to this but it is far
more likely that we are dealing with the
same silicon lottery as any other CPU
because you got to remember even on the
same wafer no two processors will have
identical characteristics so if it
doesn't make any sense
why do people still think it's happening
most of the time as far as we can tell
it just seems to be a fanboy argument
justifying why someone disagrees with
the results being published by the
dishonest media and frankly we're just
so tired of hearing it that we not once
but twice the first time we bummed up
the footage so we had to start over
including buying two more CPUs Anthony
not once but twice went out and bought
these CPUs so we could show you this
TLDR for gaming we found basically no
variance in frame rates even in direct
x12 mode while synthetics actually
favored our retail chips as for
productivity tests on the intel side our
chips traded blows back and forth but
not a clear-cut victory for either side
and we put this down to normal chip or
even run two run variants due to the
dynamic and reactive nature of turbo
boost and then as for team red it was
pretty much even across the board so for
better or for worse
AMD appears to be shipping exactly the
same product today that they were in
April of last year and then to back that
up we even tried overclocking both of
our AMD chips our Intel ones were locked
but both of our AMD chips had identical
clocks at identical voltages and
identical temperatures but even crashed
at identical settings so in summary then
this conspiracy theory is busted for the
two major cpu players and while nothing
that we've said today is going to
prevent people from making these
arguments in the future what I hope is
that it has at least armed the rest of
you with the ammunition that you need to
shut them down once and for all
it doesn't make business sense it
doesn't make engineering sense it just
doesn't make sense
but you know what does make sense
switching to ting ting is the mobile
carrier that's focused on customer
service and customer satisfaction when
you call ting if you have an issue for
whatever reason you do not speak to a
robot you get put through directly to a
person and you don't pay extra for the
privilege in fact the average ting bill
is only 23 bucks a month per device
because of the way they billed you pay
only for what you use now if you're
stuck in a contract and you switch to
ting they'll cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to 75 bucks and if
you use our link
Linus ENCOM to try out their savings
calculator and see if you'll save money
you can actually get another 25 bucks in
service credit or towards a new device
so go try it out so thanks for watching
guys if this video sucked you know what
to do break that one yeah but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the stuff we featured in the video
description maybe literally these ones
maybe we'll put them on eBay I don't
know also link town there's our merch
storage has cool shirts like this one
and our community forum which you should
totally join we have so many processors
and how</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
