asou saver - thanks 58 motherboard this
is part of their the ultimate force or
top series of boards so let's talk a
little bit about what makes the tough
series special number one not this
number one is tough components certified
by military standards so they are using
the hard most hard core components
possible to ensure that this board lasts
for as long as possible and they do back
it up
a Seuss's standard motherboard warranty
is three years whereas this particular
top series board has a five year
warranty which is pretty outstanding so
let's talk a little bit about some of
the other special things about the tough
series
it has ceramics heatsink coating tech
which in theory allows better cooling
than a purely metal heatsink we also
have efficient switching power design so
that means optimal power efficiency
alright many as whose boards do feature
technology like that for optimizing
power efficiency but this particular one
is tough evidently we have SATA 6
gigabits per second USB 3.0 mem okay
which is a feature I have talked about
quite a bit in the past so I'm not going
to go too far into that as well as askew
design so you've got a cue shield which
means that you can easily put in the
motherboard from the back and you're not
going to bend pieces of metal into your
slots you've also got Q connectors which
I believe we have talked about and
actually some of these I'm not familiar
with oq dim right that's the quick
installation dim so I'll show you that
when we actually look at the board
itself and maybe I gave you figure out
what the other ones are huh here we go
yes five-year warranty notice look at
that it's in many different languages -
here is the motherboard user guide
including a powered bias - sticker and a
disk that you shouldn't use you should
download the latest utilities and
drivers from the seuss website here is a
certificate of reliability check that
out it's certified reliable so test
method 103rd will shock test look at
this so these are all military standard
tests are running on this thing on the
chokes MOSFETs and capacitors alright
that's pretty neat actually okay then we
have a2
SATA 6 gigabits per second cables and
twos dated three gigabit per second
cables please note these are identical
cables except for the white on the six
gigabit per second ones they do not
perform differently we have an sli
bridge we have the assist cube connector
as well as the key shield with the fuzzy
foam on the back alright let's have a
look at the board itself now the look of
this board is a bit love and hate not
everybody loves it but lots of people do
because it's a very military themed look
so youth that means you've got military
greens military camouflage style browns
you've got a black PCB which is
definitely a must for high-end board
these days and then you've also got a
lot of black components as well so let's
look at the layout overall of the board
first of all you've got what appears to
be an 8 + 2 power design around your LGA
1366 socket you've got a fair amount of
room around the socket for aftermarket
coolers and I think that's pretty much
all there is to say about the socket
itself you've got an 8 pin power
connector up here and it's ideal
location and I've been asked about this
a few times but this little cover is in
case you do not have an 8 pin power
connector on your power supply you can
just plug in 4 but if you have an 8 pin
use it you've got support for up to 24
gigs of ddr3 memory in triple-channel
mode so you want to populate the light
brown ones first and then the dark brown
ones second that is a limitation of the
core i7 memory controller this board
does support up to 6 core 9 ATX Extreme
Edition processor over here on the right
we have our 24 pin power connector in
its ideal location and right here we
have the mem ok button so that means
that no matter what the memory will post
so it'll find a very very safe setting
allow you to post with your memory and
then tweak the settings from there let's
keep moving down the board we have SATA
6 gigabits per second which actually
isn't here it's here so those ones that
are white coloured those are your SATA 6
gigabits per second and the black ones
are SATA 3 gigabit per second let's talk
a little bit about the ceramics which
you can see is right here so that's this
kind of sandpapery feeling coating on
all of the heat sinks on this board I
don't know if it makes it cool better
because I haven't like I don't have an
identical board with identical
sings to test again but I guess in
theory it does and ultimately it looks
pretty cool so I mean the x58 doesn't
even get that hot anyway so it couldn't
really matter one way or the other but
looks great I think check that out
those are cool heat sinks all right so
let's keep going around so here's our
front panel connectors here's our clear
CMOS button we have three PCI Express
slots on this particular board so your
SLI slots are going to be these two
that's why you did have a short SLI
bridge included so when you're using
both of these in 16x mode my assumption
is this one is going to run in 4x mode
just like on all x58 motherboards you do
have one PCI slot but as soon as you
install a graphics card that's covered
assuming you're using a dual slot
graphics card you could alternately
install your dual slot graphics card
here which would leave you one two three
four more slots for additional expansion
cards
here's your front USB as well as your
front audio and I'm going to go ahead
and assume this is firewire although it
is not labeled then other than that
that's about all we have to say about
the board itself on the front I think
this looks really cool get a good
close-up of that because it looks kind
of like you know it's attached by they
got pipe or something it's just the
Southbridge heatsink I mean there's not
a whole lot to it but it looks pretty
neat okay the back of the board doesn't
really have anything out of the ordinary
about it so let's have a look at the i/o
panel on the back we have one two three
four five six USB 2.0 connectors this is
not a combo connector so this is an
eSATA connector this is also an eSATA
connector here we have one of those
handy ps2 keyboard or mouse ports we
have optical audio out Gigabit Ethernet
firewire I know I'm going in kind of a
random order today USB 3.0 as well as
7.1 audio out so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the saber-tooth x58
top series motherboard from a soos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
