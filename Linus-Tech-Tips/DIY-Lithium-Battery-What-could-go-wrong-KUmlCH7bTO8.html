what sounds more fun than like one of
those cool ride on Power Wheels things
I've noticed the fact that this is not a
brand name power wheels this is a cheap
Chinese knockoff but that's not the
point in today's video the point of
today's video is what's more fun than
one of these Power Wheels right on
things a souped-up one and as it turns
out you can make them go double triple
or even quadruple as fast
simply by over volting them now you
could do that by just buying yourself in
this case this is a six volt model so a
12 volt battery at the hardware store
and plugging it in but this is live as
tech tips so instead of that I decided
to order myself a DIY lithium battery
kit let's see how this goes pulse way
pulse way lets you remotely monitor and
manage all of your Windows Mac and Linux
machines from one app create your free

description
now I hadn't originally planned to do a
video about this so you guys are gonna
have to forgive me if I am NOT as
prepared as even I normally am but I am
going away to Disneyland in three days
and I need to queue up enough videos for
a while I'm gone
real talk real talk right now and I was
telling ed about this plan that I had to
sort of trick out one of our Power
Wheels not actually this one and he was
like oh we should we should do a video
about that and I was like still kind of
like learning and I really don't know if
this is the most optimal way to do it
and he's like oh ya know it sounds like
a video so um basically what I've
ordered here so these are 18 650 s these
are 3,500 milliamp ones I think it's
either Samsung or LG Chemical on or
whatever they're like chemicals like
division is either Samsung or LG cells
and then these are high current ones
because not on this one but actually on
the two seater that I am planning to
have all of this end up in you can
actually see some pretty impressive peak
power draw so I've got a bunch of these
then I picked myself up with this puppy
so this is the charging / controller
board that you need anytime you're
building a lithium battery and I can't
remember if this is a balanced charger
or not so I'm gonna have to look that up
so I can determine exactly what type of
charger I need to use on it
I do have a balance with the embattled
charger at home but I forgot to bring
that today all right I guess you can see
here this is for seven cells in series
so parallel determines how much capacity
you have and series determines what the
voltage is gonna be so this is a six
volt model and I'm gonna be hitting it
with about 24 volts so we're going to
burn it out pretty quickly but
realistically I was I was gonna get rid
of
this one anyway the idea is to make the
the jeep Power Wheels that I have at
home go tight twice the speed and while
making this one go four times the stock
speed this is one of the kits from
Verizon veeru's it I don't I don't know
what they I don't know how they
pronounce their thing but basically
resists vibration loosening it's safer
hey it's safe oh yeah what we're doing
today building a lithium battery pack
it's a modular lithium battery pack kit
just chill what it's all good Tory about
it fully customizable where where is the
guide don't we have a bunch of like
12-volt batteries just like sitting in
101 yes well a this I'm building a 24
volt battery which yes I know and B I
wanted the weight and quick charging and
I just wanted to do it this way because
it's fun okay to turn this bunch of
cells into a battery we need to wire
together all the cell's correctly to get
our 29 volts and 30 amps at full charge
to do this we'll be creating a 7 s 3 P
battery meaning there will be seven
cells wired in series and then three of
those wired and parallel construction of
the battery is pretty simple although if
we wire up one cell incorrectly or even
just drop a nut or touch a screwdriver
across the wrong place we risk causing a
short circuit that could electrocute us
or at worst cause the battery to explode
someone's gonna blow themselves up okay
I think we should do the things first
and then put gels in so then
theoretically we can take your whole
thing
and lipid e blah pity hold on let me
help you get that aligned okay we have a
rubber mallet here no we're not rubber
mallet in these why not because we're
not because that's not a good idea
well I don't know maybe it's pretty hard
to push like we did this three more
times and got what seemed like should be
ready to wire up battery until we
actually thought about it it's really
easy
before you begin they'll make sure you
understand how series and parallel
electrical connections work
I want to brush up with a subject blah
blah blah blah blah don't short a
circuit that's bad got it I wanted
cereal wouldn't I need to go from here
to here though that makes that in order
to do that you need to do every row oh
this is easy Oh
maybe well let's find out oh they have
videos oh oh okay we'll be back in a
minute here we're gonna watch some
YouTube to learn
Penza thought if we flip around every
second cell creating the connections
will be super easy by just placing the
bus bars across the top so the good news
is we weren't that far off pretty much
these bars go on and we make all the
parallel connections between our cells
oh yeah I can't no thing I'm hold on I'm
just trying all my contacts here we good
we good we good we good beautiful now we
have to attach the yeah I don't know
so let's we're gonna watch we're gonna
watch this other video BRB
alright so we ran at a time yesterday
it's day two but there's some good news
I was able to bring in the actual car
that I intend to use so this one
shouldn't fry immediately when we hook
this battery up but there's some bad
news
so I had planned to either hook this up
the battery management system for a
single input charging or I had planned
to hook it up with this doodad and then
use a balanced charger like this one but
I forgot this is a maximum success
balanced charger so this won't work
which means we're gonna have to use the
BMS except for one small problem we
can't find a single power adapter in the
building that is so you don't take the
three point seven volt nominal voltage
you take the four point two volt charge
voltage so this thing can't take
magically like a twelve volt input and
turn it into thirty volts you need an
actual like 30 volt charger and 7s as
far as I know is a pretty oddball
configuration so I'm not sure how we're
gonna charge it but I'm gonna start to
wire it up anyway I found a thirty three
point six volt one do you think it would
work thirty three point six yeah I don't
know what do you think the tolerances
are like on something like this for
input probably fine we have twenty nine
point four that we were looking for
twenty nine point four yeah I knew those
stupid hover shoes were gonna come in
handy for something we're gonna
cannibalize the charger well yeah well
yeah cuz I don't have a socket for this
so first things first all the balance
wires are on go and my negative I
believe this is negative charging yep my
negative charging wire is soldered now
what I need to do is throw on two
positive wires to the opposite terminal
here so to the positive terminal at the
other end of the battery one of those
will be for charging one of those will
be for discharging now I realize I'm
opening myself up to some
soldering technique critique here but
this is how it's going on Alex do you
want to solder me I'm sorry let's go for
a solder bath
okay that's Lots oh man I can feel the
the cringing just wait till the verge
does this that'll make me feel better so
we've got our eyebrow tweezers and our
butter knife okay don't don't include
that last bit we don't want to be too
mocking of the verge we're not trying to
make enemies in the industry I don't
have captain tape we really we really
need to get like some more electronics
project crap so I'm gonna go get packing
tape just cuz I need to keep those wires
out of the way for all the viewers out
there who know what they're doing with
this stuff alright make it better or
worse that in many cases I know the
right way but I'm doing it this way
anyway ah
now they say in their guide you don't
have to solder this but I think that's
really stupid personally I think
advertising is that stop it okay stop
you're doing that
oh nice now typically hat nuts aren't
reusable but I managed to kind of crush
it back on there okay all right so we
can test then
well first I'm gonna have to show you
guys the before of course here we go
so you pretty boring this is not the
recommended way of doing this again if
you wanted the recommended way would you
be watching my video
oh we're gonna ruin our floors here we
go there's no steering on this floor
oh shoot how's my phone is my phone okay
oh it sticks out of my pocket sometimes
it's okay so that hat not not a great
solution just bending it back
so this is our pretest this is with the
original battery which has like a
somewhat fresh charge it's not not super
fresh but it's not like the first either
so uh verse first gear second gear now
it's really important for a reliable
operation to install people do either 30
amp or 40 amp breakers in these things
but I'm gonna do that later when I do my
whole ESC upgrade with the sewing
machine and pedal and all that kind of
stuff so this stock connector no longer
has any use we are wired up now baby
hope that's reverse it's definitely
faster
that's first here and we need to move
over to unit 101 started up to high gear
oh oh that was a that was an undesirable
this is really hard I can't even use I
can't even use my foot oh really
no I'm just using my hand oh lordy there
we go oh yeah j-turn oh I tried to throw
I tried to throw it in forward
Wow the tractions actually pretty good
out here so there she is she's a little
toasty she's definitely ready to be left
to cool and then charged and that's it
that's a DIY battery for better or for
worse and this whole Ness is brought to
