to setting up your data traveler Locker
plus so that was the USB flash drive
that I unboxed very recently so this is
a 16 gig one here so I plug it in and
then I run the DTL + utility takes just
a moment to launch and then here we go
so language English that will work out
just fine for me but there's your
language selections that you can choose
from and I accept the License Agreement
which is it's actually not that long
it's actually readable ok and then I put
in a password so here we can see the
password rules 6 to 16 characters long
and contain at least three of the
following uppercase lowercase digits and
special characters Wow okay well it
happens that my personal favorite strong
password already contains a bunch of
different kinds of characters so I'm
just typing in my other hand here and so
that should be just fine
so my hint will be strong okay there we
are I can blow I can put in my name
okay so I'll put my name my company as
most of you already know is NCIX
and then details I don't really have any
okay so go ahead and finish so it's
formatting the drive
we'll see how long that takes hopefully
not too long Oh done okay so that was it
so can we
open the drive now oh yes we can okay so
there I opened up bah another Explorer
window and it's giving me the option to
have the drive okay well why don't we do
a quick speed test while we're at it so
let's grab a large file like a say for
example a video file and copy it over
there so this is a 799 Meg file and I'll
let you guys do the timing if you feel
like it but we can see what windows
report says the speed which isn't
actually too bad for destroyed on normal
USB flash drive some of the quad-channel
ones will do up to about 25 megabytes
per second so I assume this one's a
dual-channel one this should be done
fairly shortly I guess I could have
chosen a smaller video file if I really
wanted to anyway the advantage that you
get with the locker plus is that you
have the data encryption so what I'm
going to do is once this file is on the
drive I'm going to take it out put it
back in the computer and then we'll see
the little prompt where it should ask
for a password before I can actually
access the drive
that's cool one patient
almost done
and there we go so the file is copied so
I'm gonna go ahead and pull it out of
the computer now I can find it there it
is okay we have removed it now let's try
again
plug it in and let's see what happens
here we go
so can I just open a folder to view that
oh no I cannot so I have to actually run
the the autorun okay open autoplay run
the launcher so now hopefully it'll give
me a choice to just put in the password
and access the data yeah there we go
I've never actually used an encrypted
USB before okay there's my hint so I can
log in and there we go there's my data
so if I copy this into here yeah copy
and replace we can see how quickly we
can read off the drive so you can see
the reads are quite a bit faster than
the writes
bear in mind you're gonna get slower
results if you're using a number of
small files versus one large file so I'm
giving it every advantage here to prove
its best-case scenario but there you
have it there's our little set-up guide
and test of the Kingston 16 gig data
traveler Locker plus don't forget to
subscribe to - tech tips and I have a
question for you if you want to leave a
comment under the video tell me what you
would use an encrypted USB thumb drive
for and the winner of whoever I think
has the best or funniest or most
appropriate or I don't know it's gonna
be arbitrary but I'm gonna pick one
winner and they will win a 16 gig
DataTraveler Locker plus so that's
pretty cool right leave a comment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
