brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries hey guys i'm here at the
indy mega booth again with a game that
I'm going to call raves but i will have
the developer actually tell me how it's
actually called so it's a dutch game and
we actually pronounce it a vote and we
still allow you to say reuse them that
helps me a lot because that
pronunciation is difficult for me can
you go over a brief overview of what
this game is about yeah sure so it's a
god game and you control several Giants
you probably see them here in the
background and these Giants shape nature
and you save nature to create a utopia
for mankind so mankind settles down
they're not on your under your control
but they do use all the resources on the
planet and at some point they will one
more than you can give them and they'll
start attacking each other and it'll
even start attacking your Giants so even
though your goal is to develop humanity
they're actually really impedance oh
it's the goal to balance grief and
growth it's a really interesting
background narrative now these Giants
are the different types yeah so there
are four different types you control all
of them at any time there's a rock giant
was responsible for the mountains you've
got a notion giant forest Giants and the
swamp giant or just some more exotic
things yeah and how would you balance
those like how would you go about I know
there's different ways but how would you
go about creating your personal utopia
for Humanity so there's several ways
about it you start off with a clean
planet or clean slate so you can do
whatever you want but you Mandy will
behave differently so that will give you
different rewards so you'll have to
definitely interact with that and then
there's an RPG element to the Giants so
and any in any session you can only pick
a few abilities that you will level up
high so that means you would either go
for animal life or plant life or for
many upgrades or lots of resources now
going through this game what are some
key events that a player would run into
okay some key events it starts with dare
escaping and then you've got like the
first settlements and if you're good
enough you will get more eventually
because it will only happen if humanity
grows too fast so war is actually a very
important events because it stops you
from developing humanity and makes you
deal with problems instead and then
there's a tragic moment that
you're giantess attacks and might it
might even die so losing a giant losing
a big core element of the game how does
that play in and how did you go about
balancing that so it's a very hard to
lose a giant you would really easily
destroy a village or an army but because
your goal is to develop you humanity you
wouldn't really do that you try to avoid
that so actually if the player is too
greedy about that you just going to lose
a giant only them and without one of the
Giants you can never do anything in the
game anymore so you just lose the game
so really can you actually win this game
you can but it's based animated game in
which you try to create a utopia but
every time your Giants go to sleep and
wake up again like all these obvious
gone planets barren again so you
manatees screwed up so you would only
win if you unlock every different
development for Humanity you learn
everything there is about humanity and
you create the perfect utopia all the
way in the end game and that's that's
when you win actually it's really
interesting spin on a god game because
in most God games there might be
rebellions but it's usually rebellions
against a king that's in the game not
the actual God that you control so it's
interesting to see that they can
actually attack you directly what is
your personal favorite part about this
game my personal favorite part like I'm
in AI programmer of this game so I
really like watching the tiny humans and
they can talk about all kinds of
different things and they'll do
different things and he'll start asking
for resources so my favorite part is
watching those yeah thanks to you for
checking out Reyes or how you're
actually supposed to pronounce it if you
