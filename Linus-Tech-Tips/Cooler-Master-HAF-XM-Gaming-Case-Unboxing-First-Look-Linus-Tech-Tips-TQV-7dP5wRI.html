Hat XM case from coolermaster featuring
apparently with a sticker see it's a
good thing I did this late because
otherwise the sticker wouldn't have even
been here high-speed USB three and two
and a half inch SSD support this is an
enthusiast mid-tower with easy access
latch design 3-way SLI crossfire support
the Hat series is so popular stands for
high air below which is good for gaming
and generally parts that need air blow
which is computer stuff it goes in their
computer case rich i'll with two USB 3.0
port supports 2x dock so those are
external quick easy hot swapping bays
that are it actually worked really
really well i've seen these before on
previous Coolermaster cases in terms of
other features they list on the front
support up to EA TX and then have you
seen how many PCI slots are supported
but I suspect based on what I know about
previous have cases it it's got more
than seven two three four five six seven
eight yes so it supports XLE TX as well
sliding PSU cable cover from fruit cable
management front 200 millimeter red LEDs
and six tool free hard drive SSD bays
top compartment with rubber pad so you
can like throw your keys in there and
not worry about scratching up so parts
two and a half inch SSD x one by in the
motherboard tray smart that's how I'm on
my SSDs on my case
eight plus one expansion slots and you
know what let's just open this bad boy
up
and have a look hae-sun boxing's are fun
because basically how it shocked me okay
that part wasn't fun all that hurt
that's really good stupid packaging
that's what that's what the problem is
it's the styrofoam rubbing against the
cardboard and the plastic doesn't help
the problem and this isn't the kind of
styrofoam I like anyway I like talked
foam this is hard foam
hopefully it'll survive and make it to
anyway our turn in so there's your
corners your corners are one of the most
important parts so as long as you got
lots of padding in the corners that
might make it there okay rid of that get
rid of that okay
anger fading I'm feeling good now all
right let's start with the outside
there's the manual three five and a
quarter inch base two of those quick
swaps so you can throw a three and a
half inch take from the sides just by
throwing actually here let me go get a
card drive hold on a second so hard
drive installation is easy-peasy you
just throw it in there and it kind of
locks into place it's actually like the
smartest thing ever I love coolie
masters hard drive mounting thing once
it's in there it's not going anywhere
very smart and then to install it you
just slide it back into place and lock
it in just like that is also compatible
two and a half inch drives if I didn't
say that before I can't remember cuz we
cut the footage and I don't know what I
said anymore returns a front I oh
there's your two front USB 2 ports front
audio two front USB 3 ports there is
your fan control and an indicator LED
for it your power button nice and big in
case you have trouble finding that and a
reset button which I'd say is too big
because you might accidentally press
that there's that rubber path thing if
you wanted to I don't know store your
keys in the top of your case for
whatever reason yes that is a Hello
Kitty key and yes I like it
so get over it I've had people question
this before and I am I'm totally into
the Hello Kitty key it's actually a gift
from from camerman we were at the slick
a screwdriver notice right whoa okay yes
we're gonna be cool everything's fine
then cut my arm will fit too bad okay
let's go ahead and loosen these at the
back here actually I'm going to turn
this so that you can get better lighting
on it anyway
so we're gonna get this case opened up
because I can't quite figure out some of
the external features without having a
look at the inside
so four thumb screws which are just a
little tight from the factory otherwise
I would have been able to remove those
just fine
you won't put them on machine tight you
won't have to worry about having to pull
out a screwdriver every time you open
the case because they are to list all
right thumb screws so let's go ahead and
open up this guy right here I have a
feeling this is going to be something so
ah yes okay so there are your filtered
matched vented that's the high airflow
style there is your 200 millimeter
cooling fan that apparently has room for
like another one which is awesome so you
can pack 2 to 200 mils in the top or you
can do a triple 120 and it looks like
there should be room to actually water
cool that that stuff that's oh that's
incredible
so yeah look how much room there is I
mean there's all this space here and
then you've got a little bit of space on
the other side so yep triple rad triple
rad ready with no problems whatsoever
let's go ahead and throw that in there
maybe put that fun screw back into place
I mean you won't access this often so I
don't mind this being based on a thumb
screw not on like some kind of tooless
latch mechanism
speaking of Tula splash mechanisms on
the side you've got more cooling fan
spots you know what I'm just gonna have
to check but those are they look like
140 miles a second and we figured it out
it's dual 140 or single 200 mil which
means so far you've got a 200ml on the
front two 200 millet in the top and 200
mil compatibility on the side giving you
massive well high airflow so there's
your handle on the side opening up the
case and there's your more nation'
whatnot you clean that off if you want
to otherwise you can you know just be
gross and not clean it that's fine too
bit of a ball chair it's gives you more
room for graphics cards or CPU coolers
see where that's positioned that are
tall and take up space all right moving
inside to the case we're gonna I'll
actually flip this around first so we
can take off the other side pal
there you go so they give you more space
for cable management in much the same
way as they do on the other side keeps
things symmetrical mixes so you're going
to be able to do a really nice job of
managing the cables inside this case
because there's lots of space here more
space from the side panel which means
you run like 24 pin cable you're gonna
be able to cross stuff over that no
problem lots of room here for all the
cables that are going to come out of
your power supply and then a couple of
spots here so there's your 8 pin there's
your your opticals as well as that front
harddrive hot-swap there's your VGA
cables and this is for your front panel
audio because motherboard manufacturers
insist on putting that connector over
there why do they do this I don't know
this one you can probably use for your
like front panel connectors like a power
switch and all that good stuff from the
other side you can also see a few
interesting things so there's our six
three and a half inch sliders which is
that same mechanism I showed you in the
front where it's really easy to install
a three and a half inch drive there's
that 200 millimeter red LED fan in the
front we look pretty sweet in the dark
and there's an adapter for a fan which
apparently fell off something okay that
seems like it's not supposed to be there
very large CPU cutouts you're gonna be
able to install your CPU cooler even if
your motherboard is already installed in
the case and there is that two and a
half inch SSD mounting point on the back
here so that's not going to be in
anybody's way if you wanted to have a
system where you basically couldn't even
see any of the drives that would be the
way to do it your rack your SATA cables
right around here and then they can go
right into that drive at the back very
very cool stuff alright in terms of
accessories let's have a look at what we
got here that's right I can unbox things
one-handed and then unbag them and then
pour them out who needs two hands anyway
so
Kruse standoffs cable lots of cable ties
I don't think I've seen anyone include
this many cable ties before very good
stuff Coolermaster way to go black cable
ties to that's the best time more screws
speaker caiman moving right along
this guy right here can be repositioned
which is nice you just undo these screws
and a one and two you can slide it so
that it'll allow you to bring up the
cables where you want and hide the
cables where you don't want to see them
glad to see this is modular I've seen
this kind of stuff attempted in the past
but it usually ends up looking kind of
cheesy Coolermaster has the right idea
with this one though you can actually
hide the cables if you have a non
modular power supply and it'll actually
look really really clean love it
power supply is mounted on two rubber
standoffs right here as well as with a
filter intake on the bottom so you're
not going to have any dust accumulating
in your power supply we've got those
eight PCI slots that I mentioned here as
well as that auxilary one for things
like I don't know an extra fan
controller or whatever else you want to
mount in there I already covered all of
the yes the rubber cable management
holes such as this one this one and this
one very soft rubber in here which is
really nice means you're not gonna
accidentally warp them out of place and
then have them stick there like we saw
with the original fractal design define
r2 which had a very hard rubber that was
not very good and then we've got haha
one power in and 2 SATA datas for those
front slidable drive mounting cages
there's our toolless five and a quarter
inch base and I think that pretty much
wraps it up oh hold on there's a screw
here oh cool look at that you can
actually remove this top three and a
half inch cage so you could install like
video cards that are like two and a half
feet long if you really wanted to and of
course the included 140 millimeter fan
in the back all the cooling options are
included thank you for checking out my
